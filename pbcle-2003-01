Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

lies. i can think of a zillion examples of people putting out all
digital shit, including damn near every old drum and bass track
that soul/rock singer cody chestnutt. if you want to put out
quality albums, write quality songs. production values are yet
another farce invented by people in the "industry" who are all
trying to make money off of people making music.

Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Monster Productions presents...
Bubble Bobble <><>The Bubble Party<><>
Sat Jan 25th 2003
Central, OH
Admission: $15
>From the people who brought you B2S, the 12 hour, $4 parti in downtown... 
Justice, bringing warehouse parties back to Columbus... Back 2 Skool 2, 
keeping the columbus parti scene alive for only $6.... Bubble Bobble. This 
is an fundraiser for a HUGE event in the summer of 2003. This will have 
bubble machines running all night long!
TALENT:
Kevin Reynolds: Live Pa/Techno - Detroit, MI
Kevin is one of the best Techno artist that has ever came across the 
Mid-West and Detroit. His Funky and exhilerating style produced live will 
keep you dancing.
Thomas James: Residual Recordings - Deep House/Min. Techno - Columbus, OH
Thomas James is co-owner, with Titonton Duvante, of Residual Recordings. 
Founded in 1998, Residual is recognized worldwide for it's consistent deep 
house, and melodic techno grooves. The impressive Residual discography
boasts releases by accomplished artists such as Boo Williams, John Tejada, 
Dan Curtin, Fabrice Lig, Todd Sines and Titonton. As a DJ, Thomas James is 
known for his impecable taste in deep house, melodic and minimal techno. 
His track selection inspires and his skill motivates. Thomas has held 
residencies at Axis (Columbus), Club 504 (Columbus), Touch (Cleveland) and 
is currently half the force behind columbus' first all live electronic 
monthly event, Proceed. As host of these evenings, international caliber 
guests have included Kit Clayton, Glenn Underground, DJ Swamp, Dan Bell, 
John Tejada, Robert Hood and Hannah to name a few. Future plans include 
new 
releases on Residual, and another return to Europe where he's played in 
Switzerland and Spain.
JJ BOOGIE: www.wellknowndjs.com / www.groovereactor.com Groovereactor - 
Trance & House - Cincinnati, OH
A veteran behind the decks now in his 7th year, JJ BOOGIE
is one of the names to watch in 2003. Having been booked all over the US 
and in Canada - look for a fresh set of the top dance tracks you will ever 
hear. His peak time sets create an amazing energy and you can expect the 
whole room to be dancing non-stop. He's now touring to support the release 
of his recent mixed CD - GENESIS and his upcoming vinyl album on his own 
Groove Reactor Records.
Quantum: Mythodic/CEG/Ritual - House/Progressive - Columbus, OH
To most DJs, the term "perfectionist" would seem a mighty compliment, but 
not to Columbus' DJ Quantum. To him, the word doesn't begin to convey his 
meticulous attention to detail when mixing; he is, in his own words, "More 
like an 'Obsessive-Compulsive Mix Freak.'" Citing eclectic musical tastes, 
Quantum's syrupy-smooth style is derived from musical influences like 
Danny 
Tenaglia, John Digweed and Steve Lawler. Much like the aforementioned 
artists, in his sets he stresses song selection and programming above 
tricks and gimmicks.
Nostalgic: Downtown Entertainment - Funky Breaks - Dayton, OH
Aus-10: Ascension DJ's - Intelligent DNB - Columbus, OH
NautiKat: Ascension DJ's - Female UK Hard House/Trance - Columbus, OH
Oompaloompa: Airplane Clique - Trance - Norwood, OH
Glennard Skynard: so real ent. - HHC - Columbus, OH

Sat Feb 22                        ONE LOVE                           Lorain

Saturday 2-22-03~One Love~NE Ohio~Dj Rap, Charles Feelgood, Jackal, and
more~

Wishing Well and Groovefuel make a venture north to Lorain Ohio for......
One Love.......


featuring some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky,
Tennessee, New York, Florida, and many other states representing. This is
an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio and see how much of a
great scene we are and what we can produce if we cooperate. We have
selected many dj's and have gotten full support from all surrounding crews
to bring you the following crowd rockers with more to be announced in the
next few days.


_Dj_Rap_(Proper Talent)_United_Kingdom
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londonís Charissa Saverio, aka DJ
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female,
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent,
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles_Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene".

To this day, Feelgood remains one of the most beloved DJs in the country.
>From Coast to Coast and from week to week he can be seen spinning at
landmark clubs such as Twilo, Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild
popularity overseas. With Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak
hour House sets only one question remains - Can You Feel It?

ON THE CUT AND DROP TOUR WE HAVE JACKAL AND FACTORe
_Jackal's_Digital_Mix_Set_(Hallucination Recordings, Groovefuel 
LLC)_Miami, Florida
"Scott Weiser (Jackal) needs no introduction, both of his groups Jackal &
Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables
from Los Angeles to Berlin."-URB MAGAZINE He has performed live all over
America for over a decade and has toured Germany extensively playing all
eight major cities there. His major accomplishments as a producer have led
him to remix work for the likes of 'Limp Bizkit' 'No Doubt' 'Kid Rock'
'Yello' and 'Love & Rockets' to name a few. He now brings you the 'Jackal
Digital Mix Set' an hour of energy and controlled techno mayhem from the
mind of a master madman. Off the chain would be an understatement. Tie 
your roofs down and hide your kids.

Factor E

Odi

Voigt-Kampff

JJ Boogie

Annalyze

Nautigroove

Ariel w/ Kwest On

Walkingstick

_Mark_Mayhem_(Grand Poo-bas, Ascension_am)Columbus
Mark Mayhem has had a rapid impact on the midwest
music scene,rockin dance floors from Columbus to
Chicago with his smooth, funky blends of house, techno and trance. This 
guy is not to be missed.

_Doug_Burkhart_(Grand Poo-bas, Ascension_am)Cleveland
Owner of Grand Poo-bas Record Shoppe and Saturday night resident at The Spy
Bar, Doug is no stranger to the Cleveland scene. He has held down weekly
residencies for the past 12 years, and the vibe he can create makes for a
true house music experience you can feel and will remember.

Digital Psykosis

Kitsonik

Ale Fillman

G13

Cyberspeed

Vinny Bricks vs Cluster Poindexter

_Clay-Born_(Wishing Well, Breakline Crew)Louisville, KY
He might play alot of Wishing Well/Groovefuel events but he never fails
to rock it and is our little buddy who we rescued from the sounds of hard
house a couple of years ago. That's right if you were at Shamrock in
Columbus you saw him rip some Uk Hard House, but that is all in the past.

Melk-E

Pristine

_Tease_(In-The-Groove, Groovefuel)_Cincinnati
Making his first Cleveland appearance this young trance prodigy has a
bunch in store and he sets the vibe. He will be bringing mad cds so make
sure you are front and center for his set.

Adam Wright

_Anita_DeCastro_(Scarab Records)_Indianapolis
This young funky breaks master is making her way into what is soon to be a
great breaks scene here in the Midwest. At the young age of 18, the future
is looking very bright and from here the sky is the limit.

N:Coder

_DJ_Xander_(www.djxander.com)_Pittsburgh
For three years Dj Xander has had his heart set in the world of
electronic music. Whether it's producing, throwing parties, djing, or
tagging with his partner, 2rip, Xander keeps his head in what he's doing
to create the ultimate vibe to keep his crowd begging for more. This
aspiring, young talent has landed himself on the same lineups as talents
like Dj Icey, Frankie Bones, and Huda-Hudia. Prepare for yet another
unforgettable journey as you are about to be moved by the sounds of Dj
Xander.

your fucking insane...probably 70% of all uk dnb is taken to simon at the 
exchange in london for mastering...read the edge of vinyl next to the label, 
his autograph is right there...why...cuz he has a quality neve console, 
genelec monitors, tape machines, and tube pres out the 
wazoo...remember...most of the dnb guys did or still do everything to dat or 
rtr for mixdowns...you still think im lying? look up the exchange...i dont 
have the address handy...but i can post it when i get home...they take a 1/4 
page out every month in knowledge.

how the fuck can you defend justin timberlake in one thread...then totally 
dis the people that make justin timberlake sound as good as he does? without 
quality engineers manning the console all your teenybopper shit would sound 
like shit...not the slick million dollar productions they sound like...

take some xanax dood you are bi-polar

timbaland is a good producer...but even he still uses a mix engineer for 
final mixdown and mastering...

my biggest problem with justin timberlake, other than the fact that he is 
prepackaged pop crap is the fact that he doesnt even sing in his real 
voice...all of his stuff is in that god-awful beegees falsetto...if he 
really wants to have his voice that high, i will kick him in the nuts daily 
for free.

Subject: {pb-cle} Pittsburgh people help me :)

I have a close friend headed to pittsuburgh this weekend, and he wants
information on the following:

<<<
here is what we are looking to find in pittsburg (mostly downtown
locations).

boutiques (markets selling handmade good... such as purses, or handbags,
etc)
bistros
artist areas of town (living)
art galleries
shopping (kinda snobby, but not really)
university
etnic districts

and finally well priced hotels (or places online to search).  i tried
several spots online and either did not find many listings or pittsburg was
not listed.

 >>>

any help on these would be of great thanks. they will be in pittsburg friday
through sunday.

I would say that this album and the last N'Sync album ("Celebrity") are two
of the best R'n'B albums in my recent memory.

(D'Angelo's "Voodoo" was the last that I really really was feeling. Craig
David's first solo album was about 50% ok...)

Once they (collectively) got out from under Perlman's dictatorship, they
were free to experiment a bit with their sound, and the results were very
good.

I respect timberlake for being able to do what most boy-band survivors
couldn't do...

How many of the New Kids launched successful solo careers?

What reason did he give you for not listing it? Or, has he simply not
had time (since he just got back from a two-week drive across the
country)?

I don't know if it actually makes a difference or if its close enough, but 
your friend wasn't spelling Pittsburgh with an 'h' at the end. That might 
matter for online searches.

I have a close friend headed to pittsuburgh this weekend, and he wants
information on the following:

<<<
here is what we are looking to find in pittsburg (mostly downtown
locations).

boutiques (markets selling handmade good... such as purses, or handbags,
etc)
bistros
artist areas of town (living)
art galleries
shopping (kinda snobby, but not really)
university
etnic districts

and finally well priced hotels (or places online to search).  i tried
several spots online and either did not find many listings or pittsburg was
not listed.

  >>>

any help on these would be of great thanks. they will be in pittsburg friday
through sunday.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: What would you do?

This one is for the REAL players...

Okay, the wierdest thing just happened... If you think you could have got
this girl tell me how you'd do it.

There's a knock at the door. I'm sitting here ravetrashing in my boxers and
pappachas and I swagger on over to the door to look out the peephole. I spy
a cute looking blonde standing out there, and I'm thinking "I've seen porns
that start like this" so I run and grab my robe so that I'm at least partly
decent, and then I open the door...

It's a really hot chick, looks early 20's, wearing pajama bottoms and smells
very nice like Estee Lauder Pleasures. She is very surprised to see me,
because she was looking for some guy named Josh Somethingorother that lives
in building somethingorother apartment H. So I'm like "well, my name's Josh
and this is apartment H, but I wasn't exactly expecting you." Then I tell
her that there are different buildings and each one has an apartment H, so
she digs in her purse and finds the building number and we make small talk
for like 5 seconds and then she's off.

So I shut the door and lock it, and then I'm like "damn, I bet there was
some better way to play that. Fucking hot chick standing there in the
fucking doorway and I send her the fuck away."

Now, I don't know if it's possible to snatch up some little sweetie like
that, who's on the way to see her man no doubt, but it was just awfully
strange that she had the right name and the right apartment, but I ended up
being the wrong guy. Especially when we all know I would have rocked her
muthafuckin wizzorld.

Holla.

mastering to vinyl and having zillions of dollars of equipment and
a studio engineer at your side arent the same. having a track
mastered by simon is not exactly outrageous, IMO its even
reasonable (especially if you then get the records pressed in
america, the mastering makes most of the difference in loudness).
but quality of vinyl pressing doesnt really mean shit in the
scheme of a record being good or not, check any basic channel
records, they sound like ass but are still the bomb. and shit,
check any old jungle records from before the time when pressing
volume and "studio prowess" took over for song quality. those
shits were often times pressed 2 or even 3 per side! ha. and thats
the best music ever created there.

what are you talking about ace? to the best of my knowledge, chad
hugo engineers all the neptunes shit, and timbaland engineers his
own shit. and i know for a fact that their earlier beats were made
on crap equipment for the most part, because they were broke. as
far as justin timberlake's vocals go, i imagine they get someone
else to do all the crap, but thats also pretty much unrelated to
the quality of the songs. he could sound much gruffer and much
less produced and sound BETTER in my opinion. 

>timbaland is a good producer...but even he still uses a mix
engineer for 
>final mixdown and mastering...

mastering is a different process altogether from final mixdown. im
pretty sure timbaland does his own mixdowns, then the mastering is
all done elsewhere, but that is also not like paying a studio
engineer to sit around your studio all damn day tweaking your
synths for you. for more examples of the best music being made
with little equipment, check the wu-tang's first (and obviously
best) LP. the sound quality and loudness are fucking shite. but it
doesnt stop it from being the bomb. that shit was all self made.
DIY motherfucker.

a-fucking-men. heads need to quit talking shit on music just
because it doesnt live up to being some lifestyle music they
define themselves with (ahem, mr "jungle is a pulse
blahblahblahblahblahblahbalhblahblvahvlb") and just look to see
where quality music comes from. its everywhere, the mainstream,
the underground, the totally unreleased, whatever. ive been saying
this on this list since 1999, all these "pop" boy/girl groups have
been making some of the more interesting music out there by
combining honey sweet pop vocals and some of the illest most
fucked up production. i can remember commenting on here about this
around the time of "genie in a bottle" and whatnot. fools keep
sleeping on the interesting shit just because its mainstream. 

anyway, ill say it again, go check the justin timberlake album,
its really really fucking good.

thats right. i start srguments, i dont get all short with people. 

>All that anger and hate mr.death email address is inside of you not

you fucking fools. i really hate having to explain every few
months about the "Death" thing. here it is AGAIN since so many
people cant separate the word death from its bleak imagery: 
back in yonder 1996 when i first got a computer, i was playing
quake 1 online in a clan called the Pirates?!?!. as the least
experienced of the crew (since i started playing network games
down at pitt's computer labs long before i had a computer) i got
the sarcastic name "Death" because i was the weakest player, by
far. the name was fun though, so i kept it and when i got my
ATP.com addy i used it. im sorry my old ass inside jokes arent
politically correct enough for you. 

>You have some serious issues you need to deal with.  If trolling and

>good/better about yourself you really need to work these issues out.

nah, i feel good about myself pretty much 24/7. dont nothing stop
that. this is just good old debate, sadly i find so little of it
on this list since people dont back up what they say with thought
out replies, just personal attacks like this one from you.

>want to boycott then don't.

you need to explain to me how exactly boycotting even the work of
respectable good artists is going to prove a point? have you ever
though about just boycotting crap music? if labels saw sales of
avril lavine's new record drop to nothing, and sales of the new
radiohead triple, do you think that might have something better to
say to them? by boycotting ALL major label releases like a fucking
dickhead all that says to people is that "the internet is ruining
the music business, look at how all the sales have fallen". let
the sales on crap music fall, keep sales on good music up.
otherwise youre just going to help do a better job of having the
people with power and money (the big labels) keep forcing pressure
on the government to crack down on filesharing and whatnot. so go
right ahead and clarify your point, because i seem to be missing
it entirely. 

>And how do your arguments hold any water? 

i wanted to explain myself before, and i gave you the opportunity
to go first. you pussied out. 

>You cloud every argument in a
>bath of personal attacks.  

nah i throw those in there just for shits and giggles. my
arguments are sound, otherwise i wouldnt have them. i dont just
say something stupid and then show up empty handed at debate time. 

>Ok, I'm done with this your email address is

youre a fucking pussy. keep being a revolutionary. go on, boycott
major lables. do it while sporting one of your jeff storm girly
t-shirts. you fucking pussy. youre so underground. fucking idiots
like you make me sick because somehow someone might accidentily
assume im something like you because i listen to techno. fuck you.

my blatant disreguard of others is actually a reflection of the

im nice to the people i argue with that i actually respect. you

yeah of course they do, but the weeding out of the middle men that
eat up so much of the potential profits of the musicians is the
first step. once you crush that, you leave a much nicer price at
which the product can be sold while the musician makes enough
money and the consumers arent getting their heads smashed in.

how is it idealistic? look at the vast number of electronic
recording artists who start their own labels to release their own
shit after they realise how fucked theyve been by their initial
recording contracts? even "Respected" labels like Good Looking are
guilty of purposely fucking over new talent, and maintaining
ludicrous exclusivity shite in their artist contracts. check all
the people jumping ship, to go with less established less middle

the shake up is a good thing. i want to see major labels giving
less money to producers who charge way too much to make mediocre
rock records, less loot to the A+R fags who can only shop for
marketable music, less loot to the advertising middle men who
leech off the industry, etc. lets see prices slashed on CD's, more
money going to building true artists instead of making
millionaires out of talentless clowns like Blink 182 or Ja Rule or
Avril Lavigne.

you dont get what IM saying ace. the idea of the radio is all the
matters. the current media conglomerate of Clear Channel will
hopefully also meet its demise, though i saw something recently
about the republicans moving to make there be even LESS
restrictions on owning both television and radio stations in the
same market. radio is the perfect place to have music advertised
for free, it just needs taken back to the artists, just like the
rest of the music "industry".

>I never bought singles, I always bought the album or the maxi. 

wow, you must have a plethora of crap albums and excess late 80's
shep pettibone remixes. im truly sorry. ; P  

>CD SINGLES
>were another way the system was manipulated heavily.  Most stores
got them
>for free and it was %100 profit because of soundscan.  They would
scan the

im just going to point out that music wasnt really album driven
until relatively recently. cheap means of distributing singles
drove music for a long time, 45's being the true bomb costing very
little to buy back in the day. the move towards album exclusivity
is label driven, of course, because they can more easily make
large amounts of money by selling a whole album off one hit track.
its pure greed. 

>With dance mixes, if a dj plays something 3 months before it is

yeah, but how big of a market does mainstream labels' dance mixes
entail? i cant imagine that its really of concern to these people
who dont make dick off of the vinyl version anyway. 

>Yes it does.  It validates the dis-infomation.  "It must be true,

man, before it was the internet it was "my cousin's best friend".
there's always some ghost backing up every stupid fucking idea or
piece of misinformation. you cant blame the medium of the internet
for this.

you know i'm right. the best thing about the internet is that you
really can, with very little effort and no money above what you
pay for a connection, find out anything about any kind of even the
most underground music in minutes if you really care. no one
really cares. thats not a problem that any amount of changeup in
the recording industry is going to change until they start putting
out good music that people will really care about.

better.

As well as all of you, who will help us make this year at FRICTION a top

OK, Josh...

This isn't a knock on you, but you'd have to be charasmatic as a
motherfucker to pull some booty out of a wrong-apartment-knock....I'm
talking Bill Clinton charasmatic....being able to turn nothing into a big
big something.

I've only ever met one man who had a chance at doing something like
that....where it would just be a random situation and in 2.5 seconds, it
could go from nothing to "opening scene of a porno"....

Scary. That man will probably hold political office someday...

This one is for the REAL players...

Okay, the wierdest thing just happened... If you think you could have got
this girl tell me how you'd do it.

There's a knock at the door. I'm sitting here ravetrashing in my boxers and
pappachas and I swagger on over to the door to look out the peephole. I spy
a cute looking blonde standing out there, and I'm thinking "I've seen porns
that start like this" so I run and grab my robe so that I'm at least partly
decent, and then I open the door...

It's a really hot chick, looks early 20's, wearing pajama bottoms and smells
very nice like Estee Lauder Pleasures. She is very surprised to see me,
because she was looking for some guy named Josh Somethingorother that lives
in building somethingorother apartment H. So I'm like "well, my name's Josh
and this is apartment H, but I wasn't exactly expecting you." Then I tell
her that there are different buildings and each one has an apartment H, so
she digs in her purse and finds the building number and we make small talk
for like 5 seconds and then she's off.

So I shut the door and lock it, and then I'm like "damn, I bet there was
some better way to play that. Fucking hot chick standing there in the
fucking doorway and I send her the fuck away."

Now, I don't know if it's possible to snatch up some little sweetie like
that, who's on the way to see her man no doubt, but it was just awfully
strange that she had the right name and the right apartment, but I ended up
being the wrong guy. Especially when we all know I would have rocked her
muthafuckin wizzorld.

Holla.

Here's how I could have seen an opening in tru Playa Stylee:

As soon as she said "she was looking for some guy named Josh
Somethingorother that lives
in building somethingorother apartment H." you pipe in with this gem:

"Well, my name happens to be Josh as well, and I'm guessing by your
infamiliarity with the area that this is your first visit to this other
Josh, and I'm sure he'd understand if you were a few minutes late."

At this point you can ask if she'd be interested in a drink, or you can even
toss a different twist on it by expressing interest and asking for the
number.

Either way, you're not left saying 'what if' and if she shoots you down, oh
well, in the next 9 tricks that you come across, at least 1 or 2 will say
yes.

For other hints as to spur of the moment ideas on how to score, I saved in
e-book style the Guide to Getting Women.

http://dredwinrodgers.com/gettingwomen.zip

It at least gives some ideas, and is something i've kept as a reference ever
since a wise indian (dots, not the feathers) told me about it on this list
about a year and a half ago...

Play on, playa

I dunno, I think Josh has plenty of charisma.  But he'd need more help on
the delivery.  I know of one person I think could MANAGE to pull something
like this off.  He's a smooth mother fucker.

Come to think of it, I know a 2nd person who could probably pull this
off...but his gift isn't smoothness, its the fact that she's never see it
coming.  He'd invite her in, offer to let her get warm and have something
to drink while she could use his phone to try and figure it out.  She
wouldn't think twice about him...until it was too late.

What I would have done to start with is invited her in!  You really need
to work on your game.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: What would you do?


sometimes the bold approach is called for.  If feeling up to it yet can 
always ask her, "you look very exotic, do you have (*__fill in the ethnicity 
of choice that is also yours__*) in you?"  Then you ask, "would you like 
some in you?"  This only works if she said no to the first question, other 
wise you have to say "would you like some more in ya", which has the same 
effect yet not as much spunk.

lol

You could always be really swave though and insist that shes got the right 
appartment and there is no such thing as a mistake.  Play up some celstian 
prophecy destiny bs, she'll eat it up.

here is your big mistake.  you went to put _more_ clothes on.  you should
have just answered the door bare-assed naked.

I use Shure M44-7s and have, more than once, gotten the protective piece of
plastic so wedged that, when I went to flip it down to protect the needle,
bent the hell out of it.  Definitely not cool.  What's even worse is not
noticing until I dropped the needle on the record and wondered why I
couldn't hear anything.  Needless to say, I felt like a moron.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} help get the word out!

i was mailed this info on the 30th.  the guidelines say usually takes a 
week.  the rom is not automated, a robot does not sit there and enter 
events. 

also i was on vacation, so cut me some slack. 

i love promoters who wait till the last minute to email me an event then 
cry it didn't get posted in 15 minutes.

more interestingly her email to me contained this phrase which to me 
means its not her event
"I saw this flyer @ the Goldie show this weekend, thought u could put it 
on the ROM."

huh, odd choice of words?

i'm confused jen, so is it yours or not?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


  There appears to have been some confusion as to the "Open House" party on Jan 18th. I had asked everyone to help get the word out, making it seem like i was throwing the party, however...a friend of mine is throwing it and i was just trying to help him out. I wasnt aware that trout had been on vacation and was unable to post this party on the ROM yet. 

  Sorry for any problems or confusion this may have caused.  

Hope everyone can make it out!

peace-jen

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: What would you do?

If your confident with your own endowment, forget covering up with a robe,
let that speak for itself man. You shouldn't really need much of a pick up
line at this point. Otherwise, be more aggressive, and just whip it out,
going on the reaction of her facial expression! Her reaction will probably
be of surprise and embarrassment, but flattered because your giving her
sexual attention. Now all you should have to do is say something flirtatious
and funny so that she wont think your some creep and just smack you.
Definitely make sure you don't say something gross, or come off as some
cocky meathead wannabe porn star.  You want her to be comfortable as
possible under extremely uncomfortable conditions.  If you can manage this
part, you actually now have yourself in position to do whatever you want
with the girl.  Just invite her to come in for a bit so you can help her
figure out her problem.  Of course it helps to be attractive to the girl,
but this not completely necessary. Girls are very attracted to confidence
and  spontaneity.  This is how you can get the girl to jump in the sack with
you right away.  If your looking for a more subtle approach, just say
something witty and try to find something that you two might have in common
and talk about that for a few minutes, then ask her if she would like to go
share that something together at a later date. If all else fails, just bust
out $200 and ask if she wants to make some quick private cash.

i think you all dont know shit about women. if she wasnt down with
the situation, there's just about no way to do anything other than
be cool without looking like a twat face. unless she's stupid
enough and with low enough self esteem, in which case anything
could work really. things like this turning into wild sex only
occurs in the letter writing seection of porno mags, and in case
you didnt know, those are made up. josh did all he could with the
situation handed to him, if she wasnt down with that there's
nothing else he could do..........

I know I would be *so flattered* if I went to the wrong house and was
greeted by a nude, well-endowed man who said something flirtatious
and funny to me! It would be all I could do just keep from getting
all over that monster cock in a matter of seconds! 

Ooohhh, I'm getting all hot and bothered just THINKING about it ...!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: What would you do?

None of you have any game, especially Goose. :-P

Nobody here could have done any better given the 30 seconds I had to work
with. A few things I have come up with from this experience:

1: Always keep your place clean and looking fresh. You never know who will
show up. I tend to be a little messy during the week because I'm working and
I don't feel like I have time to clean, and then I end up knocking it all
out saturday afternoon or something.

2: Had I done #1, the best thing would have been to invite her to use the
phone to "call over there and clear things up." That would have bought me
some time to plan my strategy, chat her up a bit and (first) make sure she
wasn't visiting her brother or something. I don't even wan't to think about
that, though...

Subject: {pb-cle} Havana last night

Thanks to everyone who came out to Havana last night ...
we kicked the new year off right ... packed ... sweaty ... and dancing.
Thanks to DC Space and Vinny for the deep house ... thanks to 7up for 
requesting more songs after 2am ... thanks to Dori for heating up the dance 
floor ... etc. etc. etc.
Hopefully 2003 will be a good year for all of us ... we have some good 
things planned ... especially our 3 year anniversary party.  Check it.

Regards,
Jason C.

Yeah, I probably wouldn't have liked her, either. I don't think I
like "Josh's type" of girl (I say "Josh's type" based on things he's
mentioned particularly liking about certain women, ie Christina
Aguilera, et al). 

hehe

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: What would you do?


a girl i know sometimes supplements her income by writing those stories for 
smut mags, not a girl you'd think would do that either.  She's good, they 
pay her for them.  She started writing them when she was under age too, lol.

I do think those things sometimes happen though.  I think many people are 
wannabe sexual freaks, and sometimes maybe not even knowing the person or 
there friends makes them more likely to something like that.  Josh's sitch, 
hmmmmmmmmm, i vote on froggy's, "nice pjs, wanna fuck".  Not that i think 
the % is high in favor of that working, its just that it has an honest blunt 
charm.  you never know what will happen sometimes unless you actually get 
the nerve to say something to the point.  Even if it cutting to the point 
doesn't work that time, trust me, you'll remember the times it does.  If 
not, fuck it, the chicks just not down, at least you won't be kicking 
yourself.

BTW:  Sounds like she was totally on her way to a booty call anyway.  She 
might not have even known that you weren't him if you'd kept your mouth 
shut.  come on, running around in pjs with and a boys name.  Sounds like an 
chat hornball that goofed up the directs on her printed out yahoo map.

I have seriously considered doing this myself. (I started writing
erotic fiction when I was 15 or 16.) I should start doing it again

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: What would you do?

You see everybody? Amanda knows what's up yo!  Not an ounce of sarcasm in
her words.  How can any girl pass up this once in a lifetime opportunity?
This is a girls dream come true.  A secret monster c*ck for the taking, with
no strings attached. They can enter your house, get the d*ck they've always
hoped for, and then go back to their lives.  Most guys don't realize when
good p**sy gets thrown on their lap, so they just wonder what could have
been.  Women want the same thing as men do.  Men just need to to seize the
moment when it comes.  You have to get the girl hot and bothered right off
so that they don't have time to think about the aftermath of it all. Once
you have them all hot and horny, your completely in the zone man.  You've
got game.  Even if your not confident in your endowment, just let yourself
sport a woody while your talking to her.  Now you've put her on the spot and
she will be embarrassed, yet flattered.  She really wont know what to do.
Then you just go for it.  With no time to think, she will most likely go for
it too.   She will be *so flattered* that
you've lost control over her mere presence, you'll be able to *tap that ass*
like the girls got a keg in her pants. For real yo!

Break it on down!

Who cares if he looks like a twat face?  If he's never going to see her =
again, should he even care.  Shit, if she's offended, it's not like he's =
lost anything, like he might fuck her a month down the road, now he's =
lost that chance.

Should've at least invited her in and see what happens.

  i think you all dont know shit about women. if she wasnt down with
  the situation, there's just about no way to do anything other than
  be cool without looking like a twat face. unless she's stupid
  enough and with low enough self esteem, in which case anything
  could work really. things like this turning into wild sex only
  occurs in the letter writing seection of porno mags, and in case
  you didnt know, those are made up. josh did all he could with the
  situation handed to him, if she wasnt down with that there's
  nothing else he could do..........

im just saying, it takes a really special kinda girl to wanna
sleep with a typically sleazoid type player spouting "hey why dont
you come in for a second" while sporting a robe. fucking the kind
of girl that is down with that would necessitate using one of
those rubbers that covers your balls, and i know i dont keep one
of those handy.

im just saying man, always go for it, just dont ever expect game
like that to work. personally id take the chance and say something
dumb as hell. but the question was "what would work?" and really
nothing would work unless the bitch is from a call girl sevice, in
which case a franklin face might make your night for you.

Hey everyone, here is a 25 minute mix of some tracks I'm digging right
now. Here is the track listing:

 

1. B R Right - Trina

2. Cakehole - Evil Nine - Marine Parade

3. The Falls - Ed Russell - UNRELEASED

4. Brainscan - Funk Monster - Botchit & Scarper

5. The Unstoppable Force - Elite Force - UNRELEAED

 

It be streamed as a 96k mp3 at:
http://www.djmoose.com/music/quickdemo.m3u

 

 

I know it's a short demo, but it was basically a quick practice session
...not to mention I just wanted people to hear these tracks. I'll be
starting to post full length mixes soon, so stay tuned.

 

 

Thanks!

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP (Kinda): The second OT list

mmm kay since some new people may have joined since this first 
started, there is a second OT list that pretty much has the same 
rules as the main OT list (i.e. none) but it is free from a "certain 
person".  If you left the main OT list because of this "certain 
person", you can join this one.  I know it hopped around a few places 
but seems to be pretty stable where it's at now.  Just to make things 
clear, this is a list completely separate from hyperreal.  It's still 
on a pop-up free, not-going-to-sign-you-up-on-spam-lists free site, 
but if that still bothers you may simply ignore this.  To join up, 
head to:

http://lists.vrillusions.com/listinfo.cgi/pb-cle-ot-vrillusions.com

P.S. Don't worry, I'm only going to mention this a couple times a 
year.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: {pbcleBS} pickup line

{{ Paul Fleetwood <tracer_nine@hotmail.com> }
How would you compliment a girl without coming off as "hitting" on her? I
seriously want to know. }}

That's very easy. You simply have to do it very matter of factly, in the
same manner that you'd say "the sky is blue, the grass is green, and I love
your sweater." I think it's the level of intensity with which you deliver
the compliment that is critical - the best thing to do is render it in such
a way that the recipient doesn't even realize it's a compliment until after
the fact. If you're too intense and render the compliment as the axis of
conversation, the recipient is made to feel uncomfortable because zie must
respond, and which of us likes to respond to a compliment, especially a very
personal one?

With respect to the stewardess, "I don't know what to say - lovely strangers
don't often show up here."

"Do you mind if I have a glass of wine?"
"Would you like one?"

schweet, I was thinking of coming out, too.  Since the prices are 
back to their usual (i.e. cheap) price.  Plus I start school up again 
on Wednesday, so I'm back to not having a life.  Like i have one now

Unfortunately we recently lost all the old member's data.  So, if you were

UP COMING EVENTS:

"GET BENT!" A Circuit Bending Workshop, which was postponed because of the
snowstorm on 12/2, has been rescheduled for Monday, January 13 @ the Chamber
(11814 Detroit Ave. in Lakewood) beginning at 8pm.
This multi-part workshop will include tips, tricks and tools for locating
and bending gear, as well as a free CD-r of various loops and samples of
circuit bent instruments from SynthCleveland members and links to online
bending resources. Attendees are also encouraged to bring any previously
bent items for a "show, tell and play" session at the end of the workshop.

SYNTHCLEVELAND'S OBJECTIVES:

To build a community of synthesizer players and enthusiasts in the Cleveland
area
To open the doors to all synth lovers: beginners, hobbyists, idle noodlers,
collectors, and professionals.
To provide a place where YOU can network and find people with similar
interests as yourself.
To provide a resource pool for education and instruction on a volunteer
basis. This should include: instruction for beginners, troubleshooting and
maintenance info, tips and tricks, product demos (old and new), etc.
To provide a barter board for those seeking to buy, sell, or trade music
equipment.
To provide a musician's wanted board.
To organize events involving: mere socialization (gasp!), to hear a visiting
speaker (?), to support local or visiting bands that utilize synthesizers
for their style/sound.
To have a good time and be very informal!

GROOVE
January 10, 2003

DJ BAM BAM
Devin James
Didi
Sasan

www.412Groove.com
www.2amartists.com

BAM BAM WILL BE @ MILK RECORDS FROM 3PM - 4PM ON SATURDAY JANUARY 11TH IN
SUPPORT OF HIS NEW CD.

Experience the hard, jackin beats of the turntable intoxicator. Some call
him Mr. Bigfoot, others a windy city wizard of wax, but most will
recognize this sorcerer of sound as DJ Bam Bam. Utilizing his musical
aptness, Bam Bam has touched audiences worldwide. For the last nine years,
he has been directly involved in and thus accredited for increasing
awareness and popularity of hard Chicago techno/hard house music.

As a performing artist, DJ Bam Bam has been blessed with superb mixing and
scratching dexterity, enabling him to drop the jaws of diverse audiences
across the world. Accompanied by an excellent selection of music, he is
known to affix his grooves to the minds of his listeners, leaving the bass
echo endlessly inside. Bestowing his musical talents in places such as
Hong Kong, Italy, Holland, Mexico, and Canada, this certified beat freaker
has undoubtedly left his mark on the music industry.

As a producer, Bam Bam was exclusively signed with UC Music at the ripe,
yet legal age of 18. Since then, he has generated five mix compilations
and has also been sighted lending a helping hand to Chicago legends like
Bad Boy Bill for production precision on his Bangin The Box series and
more. In addition, Bam Bam has stamped his name on more than thirty vinyl
releases with production credits on over eight labels and counting.
Moreover, DJ Bam Bams popularity is vivid in the sales of his vinyl and
mix compilations, amounting to an astonishing 100,000 plus units across
the world.

Continuing his career, Bam Bam is constantly working towards achievement.
Some of his future goals include residencies in areas such as Europe,
Asia, and South America, and video production showcasing his musical
masterpieces. He also plans to continue his vocation as a performing
artist and producer, teaming up with his 420 partner Alex Peace.

Clearly, Bam Bam remains an influential factor in the industry. Employing
his ambition and talent, he continues to grow as a producer and performing
artist. His unique mixture of jackin grooves and pounding hard beats will
continue to be heard and embraced by many all over the world.

I'm going to be playing there on the 30th of January.  I leave for
Washington D.C. the next day (permanently) so I probably won't be in the

i think you all dont know shit about women. if she wasnt down with
the situation, there's just about no way to do anything other than
be cool without looking like a twat face. unless she's stupid
enough and with low enough self esteem, in which case anything
could work really. things like this turning into wild sex only
occurs in the letter writing seection of porno mags, and in case
you didnt know, those are made up. josh did all he could with the
situation handed to him, if she wasnt down with that there's
nothing else he could do..........

Yer crazy man! the Steelers are going to crush and punish the 
Titans. the last time those two teams met this year, the Steelers 
hadn't gotten their groove back on from their last season(hence 
their loss to Tenn).

btw, that Cleveland game on Sunday was the shiznit. the Giants/9ers 
game was bad ass as well.


cleveland should just scrap the Brownies altogether already =P

GO STILLERS!!! also, tune in to 970 am and listen to Myron Cope 
during the game.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR:HA!!! Browns suck!!!

In honor of the recent Steelers victory, and to protect my stomach lining
from more torture, I make the following declaration.

Heretofore, for every Steelers game of any importance, I will spend the game
doing shots of Pepto Bismol with a Zantac chaser.

Christ, what an end to an otherwise dismal game.

Normally, I'd say the momentm from this game would easily carry over to next
week....However, being that it's going to be a short week, the defense is
pretty banged up, and the game isn't at home, I'd say it's going to be
another nail-biter on Saturday.

I _DO_ think Tommy has some payback to dish out for the little spinal cord
concussion episode last time they met.

My wife, who has become quite the Steelers fan this season (after hearing

Not because of my ranting, but because every time I sat down on the couch to
watch, something bad would happen.

So I listened to the last quarter and a half of the game in my car, circling
around the parking lot of The Mall @ Robinson.

I didn't. After the 3rd turnover in the 2nd quarter, I said the game was
over.

I'm bad like that.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR:HA!!! Browns suck!!!

even in what the steelers did, the 49ers comeback last night was nothing
short of impressive.  we went from 2 blowouts on saturday to 2
blowouts-turned-nailbiters... i'm just waiting for tom to start talking
about how the steelers are gonna win the superbowl this year.

This past friday I was screaming "Go Bucks!"
Ironically, this weekend I get to scream "Go Bucs!" cause Tampa Bay has been
my team since the late 80's and I've suffered through some pretty shitty
seasons up until recently, but more than that, everyone should be aware that
the road to the superbowl is probably one of the hardest in years since
everyone left in the playoffs is playing good ball right now.

i'm glad this is on-topic.

i have no confidence at all in tommy "turnover" maddox. kordell is 
my man, thats all i have to say about it. until he's in there 
keeping the offense on the field for 45 minutes, the opposing 
offences are going to keep burning our secondary as soon as they 
come on the field. the greatness in the ball possesion offense 
that kordell executes so perfectly is that even if the other 
offense is on a roll, they are kept off the field so long that 
theyre no longer warmed up the next time they come on, while your 
defense had all that time to rest. i just dont know man. i hope we 
win, i always love and support the steelers, i just dont see us 
going anywhere with maddox at QB.

<<even in what the steelers did, the 49ers comeback last night was nothing

Second biggest comeback in playoff history is nothing to be sneezed at. I
had no vested interest other than a look at who could, maybe, possbily be
playing the Steelers in Das Super Bowl.

<<Ironically, this weekend I get to scream "Go Bucs!" cause Tampa Bay has
been my team since the late 80's and I've suffered through some pretty
shitty seasons up until recently,>>

I'll be screaming this as well. After the manhandling Tampa Bay took at the
hands of the Steelers this and last season, to see them meet in the Super
Bowl would be big. Huge. Friggin Yuge, even....

<<This past friday I was screaming "Go Bucks!">>

Speaking of big games....big up to OSU.

<<i'm glad this is on-topic.>>

Word.

I stopped reading after the last four words of that sentence....

10 turnovers in two games, Tom.

I'm not a Kordell-Basher, like the rest of Pittsburgh, but he's been just as
(if not moreso) guilty of bad passing and trying to hard to make something
out of nothing as Maddox.

Would anybody happen to have the phone number for 611 Records in Philly?

Their website is giving me a bit of trouble and I need to contact them ASAP.

monthly series of events dedicated to showcasing the emerging UK Broken Beat
sound with International and National Headliners...

PENETRATE

Jan. 31st 2003

Seiji // Bugz in the Attic, Bitasweet, 2000Black, Archive, Reinforced // UK

As a founder member of the Bugz in the Attic crew, Seiji is one of the
principal players in what's been called the 'Broken Beat' scene, alongside
IG Culture, fellow Bugz Afronaught and Kaidi Tatham, Dego MacFarlane, Domu,
etc. He has been in demand as a producer/remixer under various guises across
a spectrum of styles for several years now. Originally known for recording
Drum & Bass in partnership with G-Force/Mark Force, his profile is now
mainly due to his work as Seiji, Opaque and as part of Bugz in the Attic.
Among some fleeting guises he's also recorded soulful House/Garage as
Homecookin' (album out on Sole), Everyday People and USC for a wide
selection of labels including Bugz own Bitasweet Records, 2000 Black,
Ubiquity, 4hero's Reinforced, Papa, Talkin' Loud, Visions, Sonar Kollektiv,
Laws Of Motion, Versatile, Archive, Island/Def Jam..the list goes on.
Seiji's reputation as a DJ has also been on the rapid increase over the past
two years, touring Japan with Dego, taking in two US tours, and playing
around the UK and Europe every week at some of the top cutting edge music
clubs/events.

w/ support from residents:
Titonton Duvante // Residual, 2000Black, Archive, Visions
Thomas James // Residual, Down Deep, Proceed

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best of 2002

forreal, i had a blast at my shiznit, and i know there were no problems
either, but as for pure party atmosphere, field day had it.   parties are
best when you can get lost and talk to ump-teen different people, none from
the same background.  as for the pb-cle raves list aspect of things, there
were probably more at my party, but for the sheer great vibe, attendance,
and avoidance of trouble with flirting with law enforcement shutting down
the party, field day had it.

But speaking of my party <bsp> July 19th this year.  I know that a couple
people have already said they were down for spinning again this year
(ratana, soniq, tom cox, lemma, salamon) and sadly enough i have not nailed
down a venue, but have alot of really good options available.  Depending on
the venue, this year i may have to actually charge a low door fee (not to
exceed $3) to get the space and the timeframe i have done in the past
(5pm-~3-4am)... but I am also trying to find middle-of-fucking-nowhere
outdoor venues where we can camp out afterward pretty much anywhere in the
triangle of columbus, pittsburgh, and cleveland, so if you know of anywhere,
i'm still open to suggestions at this point.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best of 2002

Wow what a strange year and what a tough vote to cast.  I dont know if I've 
come to the point where I'm older now, the selection of parties was minimal 
or just the fact that the scene has changed so much.. I seem to have more 
fun now at smaller functions then I do at massive gatherings.  The things 
that stick out in my mind the most this year was CDG2, Field Day and Feast. 
All smaller events but I was surrounded by friends and great music.  I also 
gotta give props to Kent and Akrons scene. Almost any day of the week you 
could have gone somewhere and ran into all your friends and had a great 
time.

For any of you interested I am working on another Field Day this year. Many 
things need to be worked out but I am confident we will have something even 
bigger and better in store for you. Main difficulty is finding an outdoor 
venue large enough and reasonable enough in price that I can fund it, after 
all we want to keep it a free party..thats what this event is about.

Thank you from the control the night crew to all of you who have came out 
and supported us over the last couple years at events like Deeper, 
Tec-Generate, Field day and Rebirth, its much appreciated.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} circut bending workshop

its where you take a digital synth.  preferably a cheap one.  the casio 
SK line is a good choice.  speak and spells are also fun for it....

but the basics of it is you take wires and put them on the circuit 
boards in fun places and it makes them go whacko and make crazy sounds 
if you find good places.

you can wire up switches and patchbays for it.

some guy makes this stuff and sells it for 3x the value of the starting 
instrument, i think he calls his stuff tablebeast, look around for it 
but don't buy it.  you can make it yourself.

i've never done it, but read about it here and there.  i might try and 
make it out, not sure though.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best of 2002

hmmm, lesse....

WEMF as usual, though it didn't have the magic of years prior.  about 
the only place i get to hear hard techno and acid trance, though the 
people that played that alot have seem to have shifted more into a 
lighter wimpier techno sort of thing.  not bad stuff, but not what i 
really want to hear from them.  bah.

ultramegahappyfunrave in buffalo.   lots of good music, didn't really 
know anyone there, did get to meet bucky though.  nice setup, good 
lights,  though the sound was being run far too hard and distorted. 
 also got a little stuffy.  but after some people left the place cooled 
down nicely.  surprise set for me was sigma, this guy was all over the 
place, goa, trancecore, acid, techno, all rolled into one nice set.... 
 truly interesting.  kinda sad they had another one one new years eve 
that i missed.  i think i forgot to list it on the rom too.  errrp.  sorry.

kiss the sky.  goaheads last thing i think.  had a really surreal fuct 
up vibe to it.  low turnout.  i think another 50-100 people would have 
made this one truely insane.  alot of good music.  a gimp.  public sex 
in the basement, porn on the projectors.  some people i haven't seen in 
awhile were out there too.

cook da goose.  too much alcohol, don't remember alot of it, but what i 
do remember was fun.  lots of good people, good music.  st-evie-t.  the 
boobie parade, which i missed.   mike salamon the candyraver.  whered 
those pix end up?  whose camera was it?  was it trish's or gooses?  or 
someone elses.   got to meet ironman paul fleetwood.  man is that biotch 
ripped.

yeah, legowelt was awesome. i can never figure out how some of those 
people make relatively minimal stuff sound so good.  
as a bonus, any bar that has straubs is fine in my book!!  (the lime 
spider does also)

check out one of the old hyperreal pages:
http://web.archive.org/web/19961219234245/www.hyperreal.com/

and the original (i think) pbcle page:
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/archives/history/bits_page/index.html
while not complete or perfect some of the links work off the 
web.archive.org site, which is where i found the old bit site.  at the 
time when i was revamping i never thought to save toms old site.  good 
thing i did find it!

Subject: {pb-cle} advice, suggestions wanted

Hi there everybody!
I am calling out to you for help on a situation. 
There is a small child I know (turned 1 last Aug.)
that is in need of a kidney transplant.  Baby Makenna
has Nephrotic Syndrome and has spent a huge majority
of her life thus far in a hospital.  In order for the
transplant to happen a few things need to happen
first.  First she needs to weigh 20 pounds (she is
currently fluctuating between 17 and 18) and the
family needs to have about ten thousand dollars.  With
all of Makenna's needs it is impossible for the mother
to work, and the father has been forced to take a lot
of time off of work as well.  I was thinking that it
would be great to do a dance-a-thon or something of
the sort to raise money for her.  Another friend of
mine would like to do a Chinese Auction, and we were
thinking about combining the two.  What I really need
is suggestions on how/where to find a venue (for free
if possible) that is somewhere in the area between
Mercer, PA and Pittsburgh.  Help in any form is gladly
welcomed.  This is getting long, so I will end here. 
If  you want more info, or have suggestions for me
simply hit reply. 
Peace,
Maggie

A group of people from my college just put together something of the same
sorts out here.  Most people are real hesitant when it comes to benefits
and charities because there are ignorant people out there that make shit
up..I hate to say it, but you might actually have to get proof of the
girls problems, ex. something from the hospital so they can verify
everything. I suggest trying college campuses, even as small as firehalls
and stuff. it all depends on how big an event you plan on
having....usually those types of places are more lenient than big clubs,
but you can always have more events down the road for the same cause.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rebirth Tuesday Jan.7th TECHNO!

Where the heck was everyone?  Hardly anyone showed up.  It was a 
shame, too.  It was an awesome night.  I'm a little tired, so won't 
really review it that much, but it was a cool night.  Only listened 
to Andy James' cd for a few seconds and already sounded good.  And 
since that many people didn't show up, I think he still has plenty to 
give out (he mentioned that he's going to be somewhere in pgh next 
wednesday?)  There's the last of any parties for a while (start 
school Tomorro, and something tell me this term is going to suck (3 
really hard classes..))

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Icey FRIDAY in Columbus

There was no talk because if you've ever seen him live you'd know that the tracks are ok (not spasmoratic) but he is not.  The only thing doing for Icey is a name.  I've seen him a handfull of times and not been impress every time.  Although we did chill once in my record store back in 99 and he is a very cool guy.  Recommendation:  Hang w/ Icey, have him produce, not spin.

one i was talking with you guys a little about this weekend:

and particularly
http://www.arancidamoeba.com/mrr/problemwithmusic.html

the courtney love rant is good readin too.
http://www.holemusic.com/speech/

they all offer an inside view of the money process of the major 
labels..... i know doug has kicked in a little insight from his 
store/end of things, but this is a bigger overview, and it aint pretty.

The last time Icey spun at Metropolis (I don't
remember the name of the party) I counted seven
trainwrecks, and probably missed a few more.  I
personally expect better than that from a DJ of that
caliber, especially considering he played virtually
the same set the previous Feb. at a Groove night in
Pgh.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fwd: happy 2003!


wasn't it hyperreal.org then hyperreal.com then back to hyperreal.org.  I 
remember seeing the switch.  When i was working in the CSU computer lab in 
95 I'd make print-outs of the ROM or what ever it was then.  Funny thing is, 
i stumbled onto pb-cle by finding information on substances for a research 
paper or something.  If you looked up a drug in yahoo, it went like straight 
to hyperreal every time back then.  I had already been going to parties 
since 92 so when i found pb-cle info I was so happy that people were online 
with that kind of info.  most of the parties my friends threw weren't really 
on there though back then cause it was pretty deep underground.  i didn't 
know anyone on the list until years later - i didn't post back then, i think 
cause i didn't know anyone on it.  Don't think many cats i hung out with 
back then even had computers, lol.  I used to think the list was a bad idea 
due to the fuzz factor and the available info to anyone.  I thought it was 
an information leak, although the info did help me find some good parties.

are there any old ROMS around?

hmmm, i recall it being hyperreal.com, then they got hyperreal.org and 
ran both for awhile but at some point the .org was declared the 
"official" one, now i think they keep the .com around for misdirected 
emails and little else.
from the mission statement: "Update Fall 1997: Hyperreal is now 
hyperreal.org, to reflect the fact that we're not a for-profit outfit."

for years i've had a gnawing in the back of my head about that sort of 
thing.  did the good outweigh the bad?  in the end i don't really know.  

> are there any old ROMS around?

in the list archives, gotta do some legwork, and get to see some the 
email addresses i've used over the years.   i have the datafiles going 
back to 99 or so, but i don't specifically keep the ROMs anyplace 
special.  i probably should have but didn't think to do that since they 
are archived anyhow.

greeted by a nude, well-endowed man who said something flirtatious

Its still counterculture. The masses don't really seem to have a huge 
affinity for dnb of the type at BBT.

Wings are the bomb. Those wings aren't the greatest, but you would be hard 
pressed to beat the price. There is a vegetarian plate available too, just 
eat the celery yo! How many green things can you eat?

I don't understand all the backlash...

(That is, of course, unless you're not into the progressive house thnig....)

They were fine when they were Hydrogen Rockers, but now that they have a
different name and a charted single, suddenly they're pariahs??

Blech. Whatever.

it has nothing to do with that... but everything to do with the fact that 
we knew you would like them and defend them.  it's like that thing with

Let me rephrase - I am not into hearing "Days go by" at a rave.  Nothing
wrong with playing a mainstream track in some resepects - in other respects
it sucks.  In all actuality, it is how you program a track.  The context in
which I heard Icey use it made me groan.

she killed kurt cobain, but she is saying every single thing
exactly the same as ive been saying it about filesharing and

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} doug burkhart read this

you  really need to read some of the maximumrockandroll articles that 
explain how money REALLY works when you sign a contract.  bands/artists 
most always use THEIR OWN MONEY for EVERYTHING.  the label just LOANS 
them money against their future royalties.  seriously those are some 
good articles, maybe a little overly dramatic, but they have a point.  i 
say read those first then the courtney love one.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} COURTNEY HOLE'S MANIFESTO

When I get a chance, I'll give it a read. Skimming this article, however, it
does not seem too relevant to the dance music industry.  I'll read it
though.

One thing I do want to point out, is that when I argue about P2P and
filesharing and other forms of pirating -- I am arguing from the point of
someone involved in the dance music industry which is completely different
from the rock industry.   I just had a talk with Mixx Connection yesterday,
and they same thing as I did.   Their vinyl sales are the strongest they
have ever been, and their cd sales are very very bad.  They say it is due to
p2ping, AND as I mentioned a long time ago -- the fact that one person buys
a cd and burns it for 5 friends (and this DOES happen).  The other thing
they mentioned is that in the example of the track "get get down" by paul
johnson.  People still want that track on cd, and instead of buying the paul
johnson albume (which was reasonably priced) they don't even buy that, they
just download it for free.  This track was the incentive for buying the
album and exposing the artists's other work - instead of that one hit song.
It is just like djing -- sometimes you need to drop a familiar track to
excite the crowd and suck them into what you are doing to expand their mind
and move them forward.   The ability to buy just the track you want -
expecially in electronic music - does nothing to further the artists
development.  It makes music, in some senses stagnat.  It is just like the
dj that goes and plays all the popular typical tracks.

Now maybe that paragraph didn't have relevancy to the courtney hole article,
but i want to reinforce my standpoint that all i care about, at least right
now, is the dance music industry.  I will read it later today.

i generally avoid maximumrocknroll as i have since ive known of
its existance simply because their writing is usually horrible and
not well researched. you can send me the links for their articles
again, ill give em a show.......

its relevant to every music industry. basically what she is saying
is what ive been saying: the only people who can lose money from
filesharing (or even cd burning, basically any form of "piracy")
is the non-creative non-artist people. she sees the potential for
a simple online "tip based" method of distributing music, even
going as far as to calling artists part of the "Service indistry".
she says shed rather have a shot at getting $.5 from a small
percentage of the hundreds of millions of people on the internet
than at getting the insanely small percentage of money she gets
from selling a couple thousand albums through the established
music distribution industry. its a good read.

you  really need to read some of the maximumrockandroll articles that
explain how money REALLY works when you sign a contract.  bands/artists
most always use THEIR OWN MONEY for EVERYTHING.  the label just LOANS
them money against their future royalties.  seriously those are some
good articles, maybe a little overly dramatic, but they have a point.  i
say read those first then the courtney love one.

techno music is these days.  Maybe explain what good techno music is, but 
thats a whole other story.

I had a big long response written, and I just deleted it because I don't
care to argue about it.  Manly because this article was obviously this
article was written quite some time ago, and I wonder if she still feels the
same way now that the problem is worse.  Additionally I still feel it is not
relevant to dance music.  Our (underground electronic music) system works
COMPLETELY different from that.  COMPLETELY different.  None of it is the
same except for the rockstar marketed big name djs -- which don't even
matter to me because I can't compete with best buy prices on that product.

She makes some decent points, but the whole "tip based" thing is fucking
retarded.  Tipping is a personal thing, and while a listener might make a
personal connection to an artist there is no real person to person
relationship.  You tip well if the service is good, and if you tip well you
get hooked up the next time.

There are many other stabs I can take at Courtney, and her outlook on
things.   I just don't see this a being relevant to the way dance music
works.

I am telling you... the common clubber who once went out and bought a track
the dj played because they like it no longer does so.  They download it.
Perhaps a tipped service would be appropriate, but 90% of these artists are
one hit wonders and the cost of producing a self supported website is not
even feasable.  Most of the artists get paid a one off fee for a track, and
sometimes they get more money if it gets licensed to dj compilations.   The
dj gets paid a flat fee for his mix, he gets greater exposure and some free
marketing, and he can get more money from touring.  It is simple.  The rock
industry don't work like that.

Now sometimes electronic music artists are able to diversify, to put out an
album that is solid.  Sure those artists go on to play the rock game side of
things.

But, as miss hole said herself, mp3 is good for dance music.   I say the mp3
thing has hurt dance artists more than any other artists --- with the
exception of mediocre ladder climing talent who put out ass music in the
first place that no dj in their right mind would even play along with the
"techno club" because their music and style of spinning is best utilized
with a digital medium.   With bigger electronic music tracks, you are
cutting of the main source of income into the scene and source of new
talent -- single sales.

You know, back in the day an artists only needed one track to be big.
Today, you can't have an artists become popular without an album.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} COURTNEY HOLE'S MANIFESTO

My point came across very weak in this response.  There are a lot of ends I
left open.  Let me re-iterate:

* the article is outdated.

*  dance music is not like mainstream music in that the single holds more
weight.

* anyone who wants to perform their original music live, i agree, has to
follow the rules of the rock game (which i have no opinion of because I am
not an artist)

* a dj who is licensed to do a mix cd is spinning primarily other peoples
music.  that is a whole seperate set of production.

* courtney makes some decent points, but her relationship to the "service
industry" is not valid due to lack of face to face contact.

* courtney flashed her tits (like a tipped stripper) at her concerts :)
(was that a stab?)

* many electronic music artists don't have a feasible means of self
distribution through a website and the cost to hire someone is not feasible
for the profit return.  it is easier to get paid a flat rate and through
licensing of tracks to comps.

* i say filesharing can build the name of an unknown artists.  in the case
of most real underground artists (techno, tech house) they aren't going to
make money from selling their music to consumers ANYWAYS.   They make it
through licensing, the few hundred bucks they get from selling a track, and
from touring.

* the rest of the dance music industry revolves around selling singles &
compilations to the consumer, because most dance artists DO  put out bad
albums.

* the need for cd singles has been elminated by filesharing and it has cut
into vinyl sales but not all that much.

she, i imagine she will since she advocates getting rid of labels

when the labels cry.

dance music really can BENEFIT more from this whole thing than can 
anything else. most dance music is vinyl only, and pressed in 
extremely limited quantities that often dont make much if any 
money for the artist in the first place. pressing up those records 
involves having a HUGE amount of liquid assets at your disposal 
that you wont see a return on until you start getting money from 
distributors, and thats only if you can nab a distro deal in the 
first place, which obviously everyone cannot.

yeah the point is that if you like the music you DL for free, you 
then pay the artist through a paypal type service. if you dont 
like it, you dont give them money, and thats that. i think it 
would work wonders considering how little the ARTISTS are making 
off the sales of records/CDs in the first place. 

>There are many other stabs I can take at Courtney, and her

why not? explain to me how my logic is wrong in making small 
amounts of money but removing all middle men so that any money you 
get at all is pure profit! plus you have no record label 
pressuring you to change your style or do something you dont wanna 
do. you can do it all yourself, for little money upfront compared 
to putting out even one 12" single. and with technology like final 
scratch and the MP3 playing CDJs, this would be a huge money saver 
for every single deejay out there.

why is that? a website doesnt cost shit compared to a 12" single 
being self released. if youre lucky enough to get picked up by a 
label, youre likely to not make any money off of it since costs 
down the line are so huge.

yeah, if anything the rock industry has LESS to gain by going to a 
digital files sold for small amounts of money system. of course, 
as courtney points out, the rock bands have to divy up all their 
loot between all the members, and after all the label's cut comes 
out, youre left with not fucking much. how can anything that is 
going to be less costly for the artist be a bad thing? im so 
confused. my approach to this is purely pro-artist, and yours is 
pro-industry. the industry does nothing but leech money from the 
artists! 

>Now sometimes electronic music artists are able to diversify, to 
put out an
>album that is solid.  Sure those artists go on to play the rock 
game side of
>things.

even still, there's plenty of vinyl only albums. those cost 
buttloads to put out, way more than anyone can really afford to 
self release, which means theyre forced to play the record 
industry game. going all digital forces the odds to be more even, 
anyone can put an album up for downloading for pretty cheap, and 
with the new technology, it can be used by deejays and home 
listeners alike! 

>With bigger electronic music tracks, you are
>cutting of the main source of income into the scene and source of 
new
>talent -- single sales.

hey man, i dont know how many people you know that put out singles 
and make all their money from them, but i dont know any. not a 
single one. all the people i know who put out records either work 
another job, or make the vast majority of their music related 
income from spinning records. so most of these people making money 
off of single are the "pop" electronic music stars anyway, and i 
dont really give a fuck about them. they charge too much for their 
deejaying fees anyway. shit, id bet that any successful producer 
who deejays still makes more from their performances than from 
album sales with like the only exception maybe being moby cause he 
gets all those commercial licensing fees straight up. and guess 
what, he would still be able to sell all those tracks for 
commercials if he still wanted to, and could probably make more 
off of selling DLs of individual tracks to some people than he 
does through his record deal which has to finance a ton of 
advertising and shit plus production just to get his tunes on the 
street. 

>You know, back in the day an artists only needed one track to be 
big.
>Today, you can't have an artists become popular without an album.

is that true? i dont know that it is. in most genres i listen to, 
the vast majority of the people dont have albums out, yet theyre 
still doing pretty well. the albums thing is the new industry way 
to make more money for the label off of one thing that needs 
advertised and mass produced instead of individual singles. 

>My point came across very weak in this response.  There are a lot 
of ends I
>left open.  Let me re-iterate:
>
>* the article is outdated.

obviously since im not courtney love i cant be sure, but from what 
she was talking about, nothing has happened in the most recent 
time period that i think would make her change her mind. also, if 
she no longer agreed with it, wouldnt it be very simple to take it 
off the site? 

>*  dance music is not like mainstream music in that the single 
holds more
>weight.

as i said, i dont know who for. i know some heads that put out 
records, and they dont make shit, and thats even on some reputable 
labels. it doesnt measure up to what they make spinning records. 

>* anyone who wants to perform their original music live, i agree, 
has to
>follow the rules of the rock game (which i have no opinion of 
because I am
>not an artist)

see, i think the fact that youre not an artist is the problem 
here. you are part of the industry, and that gives you the 
entirely wrong perspective here. the only thing that matters is 
the MUSIC. and the people who make it should be the first ones 
getting paid for their music, when often they are the last ones. 
its fucked up, wrong, and generally immoral. 

>* a dj who is licensed to do a mix cd is spinning primarily other 
peoples
>music.  that is a whole seperate set of production.

yeah, and the fact that they make more money and the label makes 
more money than the individual artists does is yet another example 
of how the industry is anti-artist. 

>* courtney makes some decent points, but her relationship to 
the "service
>industry" is not valid due to lack of face to face contact.

is there no face to face contact? the internet is a big world, but 
just going on mailing lists and message boards and shit, you can 
get word out to people in a relatively personal manner. adding in 
live performance (either live or deejaying) and you can get as 
close as you want. 

>* courtney flashed her tits (like a tipped stripper) at her 
concerts :)
>(was that a stab?)

hey, i dislike courtney as a person, but her perspective as a high 
selling recording artist is an important one, as she's been on the 
inside of record deals all the way up to the majors, and its all 
the same: the artist gets paid last. 

>* many electronic music artists don't have a feasible means of 
self
>distribution through a website and the cost to hire someone is 
not feasible
>for the profit return.  it is easier to get paid a flat rate and

really, i dont believe this. go look at the fucking ridiculous 
amount of sucker deejays with their own sites with mixes up. its 
not that hard, and not that expensive. if you want, you can put 
alot of money into it, but its not necessary. and the glory of 
filesharing is that once the songs are out there, you dont even 
need to worry about the bandwidth of your site, since people can 
just get it from each other. then with your website in the mp3 
tags, if they like the song they can come there and paypal you 
loot. its so simple, its a pretty low risk business model, with 
the chance to make a good bit of money without having to worry 
about losing a ton. and you get ALL the control. 

>* i say filesharing can build the name of an unknown artists.  in

going to

make it

that aint shit, is it? they can do more for themselves self 
releasing and promoting shit. i watched Venetian Snares go from 
some guy with a website with all his tunes on it avaliable for 
download into one of the biggest stars in the experimental music 
scene. his shit is shared all over the net, and he still makes mad 
loot touring. but he always gave his shit away for free, even shit 
that was upcoming on big labels. 

>* the rest of the dance music industry revolves around selling 
singles &
>compilations to the consumer, because most dance artists DO  put 
out bad
>albums.

yeah, and the entire idea behind compliations is the same behind 
an album: there's not much money to be made for the industry 
selling singles, but moving a whole album can make much more. 
compilations can easily be made using digital mixing programs and 
using all your favorite tracks that you bought from the artists 
themselves. compilations are now obsolete. 

>* the need for cd singles has been elminated by filesharing and 
it has cut
>into vinyl sales but not all that much.

yeah, but if the entire industry changed over tomorrow, dance 
music would be in the best shape, due to the fact that CDJ and 
final scratch technology can still utilise the new forms in the 
same old way, at less of a cost. 

tommmmmmmmmmm

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} COURTNEY HOLE'S MANIFESTO

Tom, you make realistic points.  In the course of this debate over the past
few months I have definately had my mind opened to possibilites the future
holds.  There is much to this discussion and many angles that are difficult
to discuss in a mailing list.

First of all, realize that there is still a segment of the population who is
not net-saavy and won't be into downloading music.  Maybe in time, maybe
not.  It is a possibility.

So with this wealth of music available at little or not cost to people, even
courtney says that artists will have to hire promotional companies.  She
suggests that this is the role that labels step into.  I said the same thing
a few weeks ago. There will still be artist developement, payola for the
radio, and a new era of shade.   What I think we are setting ourselves up to
have is a system where "he with the most money wins".

On the other hand, underground electronic artists won't get ripped off.  I
forgot to mention that this does happen.  There are indeed shadey labels out
there who sign contracts with artists, and the artists never see a dime.  My
friend Patrick Turner got shafted by Silver Pearl records, I believe.  Still
Life and Pollen didn't see a dime for the record they had on Rumble Records.

While the road ahead for a true music lover may be bright, I think this
limitless music will cause the scene around it to shrink even more. This is
another arguement I have had.  I fear the traditional social settings where
music is enjoyed as a group, will cease to exist - replaced instead by
internet listening parties where people don't have to leave the house and
interact with society.

Instead of people going out and listening to a dj or artist and people
making up their own mind, you will only forced to listen to what your group
of friends is into.  And then comes the whole "this rules, this sucks" thing
and people won't even get exposed to have the stuff that is really out
there.

I don't know, I like to think that I have a very open mind... but there is a
big warnining sign going off saying this isn't right -- and it is NOT
because I am the one who stands to loose.  I can tell you this, when I
discovered music I wanted to absorb more and more of it.  Then when I found
a social setting to enjoy it in, that was the best feeling EVER in my up to
then miserable life... i was not a happy kid.  Now when I go out now to a
quality event, it is still the best thing ever.  When I go out and I am
forced to listen to music that is NOT good and being served like it is the
end all be all..... i fucking hate it and want to destroy everything around
it.  The people who support filesharing, the djs who live in their little
ftp cliques and never set foot in a record store.... those are the ones that
I experience as serving up the shit.

See, I also look at things in the music industry as idealistic.  It is my
belief that labels and stuff pimp out the commercial garbage to fund more
underground projects.  It's my belief that the real underground survives of
the belly of the bloated beast.  Traditionally, the people who have not
thought that way have been the status seekers trying to make themselves seem
important by thinking otherwise. But, as you guys all point out -- that's
not the artist's perspective.

I would be _really_ curious to hear the take on this from an artist like
Akufen.    He's got remixes on the lates craig david 12" along with todd
edwards (hmmmmmmmmm).  Additionally, he is an artist who has an cd that is
probably for sale at best buy - it is on cdnow and amazon.  Or this latest
John B mix cd -- i think $12.99 for this cd is a steal for the awesome music
that is on it.

One other thing to take into consideration -- i don't ever hear the opinon
of international artists on this whole situation.  Like in the case of my
store -- %70 or more of what we sell has no bearing on the amercian music
industry.



anyways... that's what i have to say.  i may follow up and rebut some of
your comments, you can scroll down.  but that's a done discussion as far as
i am concerned.


d

like i said.  if you put out a record a month and make between $300-700 off
that record -- and it is underground enough where most people don't give a
shit to down load it -- do you really think you are going to recoup that in
tips?   i highly doubt it, but i guess i'm wrong.

Madison Avenue, Don't Call me baby -- we sold 75-80 of those on cd single --
prior to their album release and before filesharing was commonplace.  That
was our store alone.  Now, we would be lucky to sell 4.  That is a
NINETYFIVE PERCENT DECREASE due to filesharing/cd burning alone.  In the
industry you don't see the true numbers, trust me otherwise they would have
to expose the corrupt soundscan system.

I don't know... but she is talking directly about napster and how long has
that been gone?  She is referencing Mambo No. 5 -- that was like 3-4 years
ago.  She is talking about gnutella.  I think that article was in Rolling
Stone 3-4 years ago if memory serves.

While I may be part of the industry, I assure you I am not part of the
mindset that most of these people operate under.  I run a record store
because it was something that needed to happen here, not to make money at.
If it disappears tomorrow... so what.. I'm looking from the perspective of
the greater good for EVERYONE -- not the artist who sucks so bad he ain't
ever gonna get a deal, jealous of the system, who wants to try to make some
loot and get popular.  And courtney fucking Hole has her husband's money,
and an acting career.   I suppose as bandwidth becomes even more readily
available you guys will be saying movies should be free.

> the only thing that matters is

> its fucked up, wrong, and generally immoral.

I see this side of things, but really, who isn't getting paid?  90% of the
people I hear complaining are the people who don't have deals, and who enjoy
getting free music and not paying for it.  Now that they facts are in place
that filesharing HAS hurt the industry, this SAME GROUP is crying en mass
"Oh, its about the artists".  That's what I see.


> hey, i dislike courtney as a person, but her perspective as a high

She would not have mattered if her husband was not Curt Cobain.  PERIOD.

If the industry changed overnight, I don't see dance music having an
advantage.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 11, 2003  THE HISTORY OF DRUM & BASS on the PHAZON!
Admission: $10 for Buzz members | $15 for non-members

Drum n bass as a separate musical style on its own, really defined 
itself by 1994.  Almost 10 years later, this rough, rapid-fire, 
percussion-based sound has carved a deep niche on global EDM culture, 
particularly in America and especially in the Northeast corridor from DC 
to Boston.  Its energy is underscored with musical tension that fits 
todays world with its sluggish economy, hi-speed technology and the ever 
present threat of terrorism and war.  Today more than ever, its brutally 
realistic sound, originally evolving from the tough neighborhoods of 
London, makes more and more sense to all of us worldwide.  So tonight from 
1994 to the present, youll hear the progression, the evolution, the 
blending of different styles that combined into what we know as drum n 
bass.  
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
ATTN: Drum n bass on the Phazon once again tonight.  All you jungleheads 
 represent madly for this to ensure permanent main room slots for drum 
n bass at Trust or were going to lose it.  Lets prove the doubters 
wrong -- strength in numbers....

"GET BENT!" A Circuit Bending Workshop, which was postponed because of the
snowstorm on 12/2, has been rescheduled for Monday, January 13 @ the 
Chamber  (11814 Detroit Ave. in Lakewood) beginning at 8pm.
This multi-part workshop will include tips, tricks and tools for locating

circuit bent instruments from SynthCleveland members and links to online
bending resources. Attendees are also encouraged to bring any previously
bent items for a "show, tell and play" session at the end of the workshop.

SYNTHCLEVELAND'S OBJECTIVES:

To build a community of synthesizer players and enthusiasts in the 
Cleveland
area
To open the doors to all synth lovers: beginners, hobbyists, idle 
noodlers,
collectors, and professionals.
To provide a place where YOU can network and find people with similar
interests as yourself.
To provide a resource pool for education and instruction on a volunteer
basis. This should include: instruction for beginners, troubleshooting and
maintenance info, tips and tricks, product demos (old and new), etc.
To provide a barter board for those seeking to buy, sell, or trade music
equipment.
To provide a musician's wanted board.
To organize events involving: mere socialization (gasp!), to hear a 
visiting
speaker (?), to support local or visiting bands that utilize synthesizers
for their style/sound.
To have a good time and be very informal!

Kevin Moon, aka Moonstarr, first started producing
music and DJing at the age of 17. Now 25, he strives
to push the boundaries of electronic music by defying
any categories or genres. Citing influences such as
Underground Resistance (Detroit Techno), DJ Premier
(Hip Hop), Banden Powell (Brazilian Bossa Nova), and
The Sun Ra Arkestra (Jazz), Moonstarr's sound keeps
evolving and expanding. His first release, 1997's
Hexed on Wha?naut Records, was well received by local
DJs. The three Moonstarr tracks spanned drum n bass to
broken beat and beyond. Following the release of the
Hexed EP, Moonstarr saw a lull in the electronic music
scene in Toronto. Seeing no outlet for his music and
the music of his peers, he decided to found his own
record label. On his way to his mundane day job,
Moonstarr previewed friend's demo tapes while riding
the subway. Moonstarr saw the potential and innovation
behind these raw recordings and in 1998 he approached
a circle of underground musicians and like-minded
friends to form Public Transit Recordings (PTR). 

The first PTR release, the compilation Code: 416,
received heavy rotation on college radio stations
across Ontario. Critics in magazines such as Now, Eye,
Exclaim! and Peace Magazine praised the album and
helped PTR make a name for itself. With the release of
the vinyl-only EP Metropass in 1999 and the CD
compilation The Blue Night Network in 2000, Public
Transit Recordings and Moonstarr have established
themselves in the field of electronic music. Moonstarr
has also received support from the international music
community, sharing one of two 12 singles with the
UK's Cold Mission (Reinforced Records). After
executive producing the LAL album in 2000, Moonstarr
finally released his first EP Dupont last year.
According to Moonstarr, Dupont "is a broken-down
musical expression about the culture of the city I
live in". Dupont was originally released in 2001 as a
double 12", with a revamped CD release in 2002 that
included a remix of "Working Man's Hustle" by Nu Era
(i.e. Marc Mac of 4Hero) as well as new tracks
showcasing Moonstarr's depth of musical influences and
intrigues.
The "Dupont" album received support from DJs around
the world, including Rainer Trüby in Straight no
Chaser magazine and Gilles Peterson on his list of the
Top 50 albums of 2001. German label Compost included
Moonstarr's track "Dust" on its prestigious Future
Sound of Jazz compilation. 2002 also saw Moonstarr in
a collaboration with Movement's John Kong to produce
the bossa-fortified "Future Visions" on Fluid Ounce
Records. 

With the great strides Moonstarr made in 2002, 2003
looks to be a banner year with new tracks and
compositions, remixes for Jazzanova, Recloose, and
Todd Sines, and an upcoming collaboration with some
members of the Sun Ra Arkestra. An active participant
in element 5's "Momentum" project, Moonstarr returns
to the City of Bridges (Pittsburgh) for an intimate
live performance with musicians Anthony Fugate (Drumz
4u) on percussion, Hill Jordan (Hardgroove
Project/Versus) on horns, Davu (Bridgespotters
Collective) on poetics, Tash (Public Transit
Recordings) on Vocals, with DJs Ed-Umm (The Warhol:)
and the soundcrews of Public Transit Recordings and
Technoir-Audio Records. The night will be taking place
Friday January 17th, 2003 at the legendary Andy Warhol
Museum in Pittsburgh, PA. The event is part of Good
Fridays at the Warhol: (5pm door, 7pm show, $3 cover)

Central, OH
Admission: $15
>From the people who brought you B2S, the 12 hour, $4 parti in downtown...

keeping the columbus parti scene alive for only $6.... Bubble Bobble. This 
is an fundraiser for a HUGE event in the summer of 2003. This will have 
bubble machines running all night long!
TALENT:
Kevin Reynolds: Live Pa/Techno - Detroit, MI
Kevin is one of the best Techno artist that has ever came across the 
Mid-West and Detroit. His Funky and exhilerating style produced live will 
keep you dancing.
Thomas James: Residual Recordings - Deep House/Min. Techno - Columbus, OH
Thomas James is co-owner, with Titonton Duvante, of Residual Recordings. 
Founded in 1998, Residual is recognized worldwide for it's consistent deep 
house, and melodic techno grooves. The impressive Residual discography
boasts releases by accomplished artists such as Boo Williams, John Tejada, 
Dan Curtin, Fabrice Lig, Todd Sines and Titonton. As a DJ, Thomas James is 
known for his impecable taste in deep house, melodic and minimal techno. 
His track selection inspires and his skill motivates. Thomas has held 
residencies at Axis (Columbus), Club 504 (Columbus), Touch (Cleveland) and 
is currently half the force behind columbus' first all live electronic 
monthly event, Proceed. As host of these evenings, international caliber 
guests have included Kit Clayton, Glenn Underground, DJ Swamp, Dan Bell, 
John Tejada, Robert Hood and Hannah to name a few. Future plans include 
new 
releases on Residual, and another return to Europe where he's played in 
Switzerland and Spain.
JJ BOOGIE: www.wellknowndjs.com / www.groovereactor.com Groovereactor - 
Trance & House - Cincinnati, OH
A veteran behind the decks now in his 7th year, JJ BOOGIE
is one of the names to watch in 2003. Having been booked all over the US 
and in Canada - look for a fresh set of the top dance tracks you will ever 
hear. His peak time sets create an amazing energy and you can expect the 
whole room to be dancing non-stop. He's now touring to support the release 
of his recent mixed CD - GENESIS and his upcoming vinyl album on his own 
Groove Reactor Records.
Quantum: Mythodic/CEG/Ritual - House/Progressive - Columbus, OH
To most DJs, the term "perfectionist" would seem a mighty compliment, but 
not to Columbus' DJ Quantum. To him, the word doesn't begin to convey his 
meticulous attention to detail when mixing; he is, in his own words, "More 
like an 'Obsessive-Compulsive Mix Freak.'" Citing eclectic musical tastes, 
Quantum's syrupy-smooth style is derived from musical influences like 
Danny 
Tenaglia, John Digweed and Steve Lawler. Much like the aforementioned 
artists, in his sets he stresses song selection and programming above 
tricks and gimmicks.
Nostalgic: Downtown Entertainment - Funky Breaks - Dayton, OH
Aus-10: Ascension DJ's - Intelligent DNB - Columbus, OH
NautiKat: Ascension DJ's - Female UK Hard House/Trance - Columbus, OH
Oompaloompa: Airplane Clique - Trance - Norwood, OH

Beat sound with International and National Headliners...

PENETRATE

Jan. 31st 2003

Seiji // Bugz in the Attic, Bitasweet, 2000Black, Archive, Reinforced // 
UK

As a founder member of the Bugz in the Attic crew, Seiji is one of the
principal players in what's been called the 'Broken Beat' scene, alongside
IG Culture, fellow Bugz Afronaught and Kaidi Tatham, Dego MacFarlane,
Domu, etc. He has been in demand as a producer/remixer under various
guises across a spectrum of styles for several years now. Originally known
for recording Drum & Bass in partnership with G-Force/Mark Force, his
profile is now mainly due to his work as Seiji, Opaque and as part of Bugz
in the Attic. Among some fleeting guises he's also recorded soulful
House/Garage as Homecookin' (album out on Sole), Everyday People and USC
for a wide selection of labels including Bugz own Bitasweet Records, 2000
Black, Ubiquity, 4hero's Reinforced, Papa, Talkin' Loud, Visions, Sonar
Kollektiv, Laws Of Motion, Versatile, Archive, Island/Def Jam..the list
goes on. Seiji's reputation as a DJ has also been on the rapid increase
over the past two years, touring Japan with Dego, taking in two US tours,
and playing around the UK and Europe every week at some of the top cutting
edge music clubs/events.

w/ support from residents:
Titonton Duvante // Residual, 2000Black, Archive, Visions

Sat Feb 01                           TRU                           Columbus

After much consideration I have decided to move all Rise events from Red 
Zone to 382 West Nationwide Blvd. known as Mekka, The Music Factory, The 
Factory, and the former Glow. 
To avoid legal complications I am switching the Rise name to Tru. All 
further events will be billed as Tru at the Factory. With the new space 
the level of production will be unlike anything before done in Columbus. 
The sound system is the same EAW line array system that most major touring 
acts bring with them for Arena shows. All lighting, laser, and visuals 
will be completely installed and programmed in time for Feb. 1. We have 
many plans to take the experience to the next level. You will be both 
pleased and hopefully amazed at what we plan to do. The talent lineup is 
among the top in the World. The first Tru event is Saturday Feb. 1st. 
To those of you who have been to Mekka in the last 6 weeks a few things.

1) The sound, what is currently in the venue is on loan from EAW. The far 
superior Line Array system was custom built for the room, and arrives and 
is installed the second week of January. It will amaze you with its 
clarity, and power.

2) Lights, 4 Mac 2000's have been on back order and arrive mid January, 
the current light show is less than 1/2 of what it will be.

3) Laser, It has not been programmed, or ulitized to 20% of its capability 
yet, Feb. 1, be prepared!!

4)Stage, headlining talent will be featured on stage, with full 
production. You will understand Feb. 1

5) visuals, Feb. 1

I ask for you support in this change, I feel that it is a positive 
evolution for the scene. I intend to surpass the quality level that has 
made Rise so successful.

Saturday, Feb. 1 The Premier of Tru at the Factory.

Talent:

BT (Exclusive DJ set)
www.BTMusic.com

First time to Columbus

Bill Hamel

+Special Surprise live act performing a former #1 smash hit.

Local DnB lineup will be added shortly in the Fresh room.

Sat Feb 01                   WISHING ON A STAR 3                     Dayton

Wishing Well & GrooveFuel LLC present
Wishing on a Star 3: Wishing Well 2 Year Anniversary
Dayton, OH - February 1, 2003

_hosted all night by Mc Jumper

_featuring the follow up to the Get Down tour, "The Feel The Rhythm Tour" 
with Paul Johnson and Translucent

_Paul_Johnson_(Dusttraxx)_Chicago
Paul has not let the wheelchair he is confined to slow him down in the 
studio or behind the decks. "Get Down", one of the hottest house tunes 
ever produced was played by everyone and their momma's. He will be 
releasing the follow up track, "Feel the Rhythm" on this awesome night so 
listen for it and be able to say "I was at the event where that track was 
released."

_Translucent_(Transparent, Dusttraxx)_Chicago
This very talented musician lays down the dopest house cuts and is a house 
legend in many eyes. Just wait til' he pulls out the trumpet and blows you 
away with the soul.

_Teebee_(Metalheadz, Subtitles, Certificate 18 )_Norway
DJ/producer Teebee spent ten years making his mark on the Norwegian drum 
'n' bass scene, but it only took one album and a handful of singles (on 
labels like Rugged Vinyl and Moving Shadow) to establish him as a major 
player in the elitist UK drum 'n' bass scene. Teebee now needs no 
introduction. He's become one of the major successes of the UK's 
forward-thinking Certificate 18 label, as well as winning the "Best 
International Producer" award from Knowledge Magazine in 2001. He's had 
releases on numerous labels, including Prototype, Juice, Creative Source, 
Moving Shadow, and many more, as well as releasing several mysteriously 
haunting R&B-flavored drum 'n' bass bootlegs. Additionally, he plays DJ 
gigs around the world, creating a stir with head-banging sets that run the 
gamut between dark and melodic sounds. More so than most DJs, he really 
gets involved in his sets, dancing about, pumping his fists, and 
transmitting an intense energy to the crowd.

_Venom_(Volume Prod.)_New Jersey
I have an idea that he is going to break out the live p.a. for this show 
and if you haven't seen it you are about to be amazed. This guy is so 
talented it isn't funny. Just wait as the dnb fused live show rocks you 
off your feet.

_The_Untouchables_-_Flagrant,_Sterling_+_Chango-Fatt_(Mustard 
Records-Australia)
Dopest hip hop duo with mc coming staight from the down under with mad 
Australian clothing giveaways. Flagrant and Sterling tore it up at Wishing 
2 now they are back to burn the tables down.

_Jen_Lasher_(Object Oriented Bliss, GrooveFuel AM)_www.groovefuel.com
A member of the Object-Oriented Bliss DJ collective and recently signed to 
GrooveFuel AM, Jen Lasher has come into her own as one of America's 
Breakbeat up and comers. Her smooth mixing skills and taste in phat beats 
have recently gained the attention of ReleaseArtistManagement, an 
international DJ roster as well as independent record label that works 
with many of the worlds top producers and DJs including Jackal & Hyde, 
Hyper, & Rick West.

Jen is no stranger to music production, not only is she contributing 
vocals to the next DJ Icey artist compilation, she's also working with 
Icey on a new track to be released in 2003. To top it all off, Jen keeps 
her style original and unique by incorporating her own tracks and vocals 
into DJ sets. In addition to her national tour dates, you can catch her at 
her residency in Baltimore, MD at Ultraworld's, Sonar Lounge. You don't 
want to miss Jen dropping her dope beats at Wishing on a Star 3.

_Nautigroove_(In The Groove)_Cincinnati
The man behind In The Groove and a soon to be family member, Jason lays 
down whatever it takes to make the crowd melt in his hands. If you have a 
love for music the way we do you do not want to miss this set so be ready 
to be taken into a state of pure bliss by the sounds of this expert.

_Sparky_Killabrew_(Wishing Well, Well Known)_KY
Sparky is coming to us off his last show opening for Nappy Roots and 
10,000 raging people. His turntablist tricks and beat juggling combined 
with his dope underground hip hop track selection, you better not miss it. 
He made his debut at the first Wishing and is now back to rock the joint.

_Rob_Riddum_(GF Music Factory)_Cleveland
Rob Riddum is one of the most well known and dedicated dnb djs in the Ohio 
scene today. The legacy began in 1996 as Riddum took his funky set to the 
streets as member of the popular Elements Squad. Now after producing 
tracks for Jackass and making a strong surge in the last year Rob is 
taking it to the next level.

_Dank_One_(Better Days, Alkaline Sound)Louisville
The man behind A*S*S, the sound system that will be rocking rooms in 
Dayton from now on, Kevin will be laying many drum and bass tracks of his 
and many other producers, that are on the cutting edge of the dnb genre.

_Lil'_Cory_(NateFx)_Lexington, KY
Cory has been itching to hit Ohio on the house tip so let's rock. He will 
be hitting us hard with a dope booty house set that is guaranteed not to 
disappoint anyone. Get ready to "Hit it From the Back".

_Matt_Freeman_(Flashpoint, Illuminators)_Dayton
Matt has been rocking the decks long enough to know, that he rocks the 
decks. Making his 3rd straight Wishing On A Star appearance make some 
noise for the man who never disappoints.

_Nimby_(American Cheese)_Cincinnati_w/_Mc Jumper_(Neutral Music, 
RPC)_Rochester
This is the first time these happy hardcore gurus will perform together so 
be sure not to miss this set. Nimby has been setting the standard for 
hardcore in Ohio for the past couple of years and is now ready to "Rise to 
the Top" like a "Shooting Star" as he throws down an oldskool anthem set.

_Dorian_(4-Score, Inneraction, Vinyl Beats)_Nashville, Tennessee
A staple in the Nashville DnB scene since 1997, Dorian's mixing and 
scratching technique will leave you in awe. We're not one to gossip, but 
word has it, he is a master at toe scratching.

_Centrex_(Unified Ent, Breakline Crew)_Cincinnati
His mixing is flawless and the track selection will make your body butta 
from dancin'. Letting people know that breaks is on the rise, Tom is one 
part of the infamous Breakline Crew consisting of Cyberspeed, Clay-Born, 
Kitsonik, Bobby Bedlam, APX, Breakthrough, and Annalyze.

_Clay-Born_(Wishing Well, Breakline Crew)_Louisville
He might play alot of Wishing Well/Groovefuel events but he never fails to 
rock it and is our little buddy who we rescued from the sounds of hard 
house a couple of years ago. That's right if you were at Shamrock in 
Columbus you saw him rip some Uk Hard House, but that is all in the past.

_Foursqare_(Wishing Well, Hushabye House)_Louisville
Marea has taken her love for house music to a whole new level. Now one of 
the best house djs our area has to offer, she has created a following of 
househeads, partykids, and just plain music enthusiasts that just can't 
help but shake their booties to the sounds of "The Lady".

_Subnet_(GF Music Factory)_Cincinnati
Music Factory introduces Subnet... Rooted in progressive styles of house 
and trance, the signature Subnet sound has evolved to a banging techno 
that is nothing short of cutting edge. Impressive to even the most savvy 
ear, his sound is grounded in fresh, energetic track selection and 
seamless mixing. Everyone come check Matt out at his first Wishing Well / 
GrooveFuel performance.

_Anita_DeCastro_(Scarab Records)_Indianapolis
This young funky breaks master is making her way into what is soon to be a 
great breaks scene here in the Midwest. At the young age of 18, the future 
is looking very bright and from here the sky is the limit.

_Def_Leper_(Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids)
If you have yet to see this crazy lunatic rip your intestines out and sing 
to them, you need to be main stage at when the music starts to hear him. 
Let's just say if you are under 18 hold your ears, haha.
More info to come this week... Wishing Well and GrooveFuel rockin' it.

The closest Paul has come to Ohio has been Chicago. It speaks volumes for 
our scene that he would come to play. If you look at his past gigs you 
will see that Columbus is by far the smallest city in North America that 
Paul has ever played. Thank you for helping me make this possible.

Now with that being said. This event is being promoted throughout the 
entire midwest. Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania & Ohio. I higly 
recommend getting your presale tickets NOW because there is the strong 
possibility of this event selling out. We are talking with both 
Ticketmaster and ticketweb and we will have them online with one of the 
services by the end of this week.
Presales start at only $25.

GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well present
One Love
Northeast, OH - February 22, 2003

The production tandem of GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well trek north with 
some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, New York, Florida, California and many other states 
representing. This is an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio 
and see how much of a great scene we are and what we can produce if we 
cooperate. We have selected many dj's and have gotten full support from 
surrounding crews to bring you the following crowd rockers:

_Dj Rap_(Proper Talent)_L.A.
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live 
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londonís Charissa Saverio, aka DJ 
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes 
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female, 
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of 
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent, 
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via 
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of 
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the 
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and 
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)_L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back 
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and 
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC 
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As 
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the 
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene." To this day, Feelgood remains 
one of the most beloved DJs in the country. From Coast to Coast and from 
week to week he can be seen spinning at landmark clubs such as Twilo, 
Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild popularity overseas. With 
Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak hour house sets only one 
question remains - Can You Feel It?

20KFreaks and GrooveFuel AM present

FIRST NORTHERN OHIO APPEARANCE!
_Jackal's_Digital_Mix_( Hallucination Recordings / GrooveFuel AM )_Miami, 
FL

Icey and Baby Anne have brought his tracks to Ohio countless times but, 
the hour is finally near for Ohio to welcome the true prognosticator of 
Florida breakbeat and mayhem, Jackal. Best known for his involvement in 
the electro-core tandem of Jackal & Hyde, producer/performer Scott Weiser 
is nothing short of a living legend in electronic music. His most recent 
contribution to breakbeat and house heads across the world: Jackal 
Digital Mix Set - an hour of energy and controlled techno mayhem from the 
mind of a master madman. Off the chain would be an understatement. Tie 
your roofs down and hide your kids because Jackal is coming to town.

Scott Weiser (Jackal) needs no introduction, both of his groups Jackal & 
Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables 
from Los Angeles to Berlin. -URB MAGAZINE

_FACTORe_( 20KFreaks / GrooveFuel AM )_Birmingham, AL

The staple of the 20kFreaks label, FACTORe is one of the most talented and 
respected breatbeat DJs and producers in the industry. Behind the decks 
since the early 80s, he's been ripping it since most of you were in 
diapers. When FACTORe throws down his pounding breakbeat, there won't be 
an ass that isn't shakin'. Come experience the past, present, and future 
of breakbeat as FACTORe brings his signature style and class on the CUT N 
DROP Tour. The tour was first named the "All The Tracks We Produced That 
You Thought Were Icey's" Tour, but, turned out that CUT N DROP was a lot 
shorter and fit on the record.

Sat Mar 01                    BACK TO BASICS 3                      SW Ohio

Groove Reactor Records and Buckwyld Entertainment Presents:

BACK TO THE BASICS 3
March 1st, 2003
Southwest, Ohio

It's been over 4.5 years now, and we're still going strong. We've thrown 
massives, club events, intimate events, and we keep coming back for more! 
On this night, we will revive the series that started it all - BACK TO THE 
BASICS! This event is exactly that - a return to the old school. We've 
secured an intimate 1 room venue, an awesome sound system, a killer lineup 
and the kind of old school atmosphere and decorations that got a lot of us 
into the scene long ago. We will be giving away hundreds of copies of 
D8A's newest CD, and we will be powering our evening's visuals with 
another laser to blow you away.

LINEUP:

KNOWLEDGE: Columns of Knowledge, CT - (www.columnsofknowledge.com) Techno, 
House, Tribal House - Continuing in our tradition of bringing out the very 
best of the east coast DJS, it's our pleasure to bring one the biggest 
proponents of dance music in the USA. A DJ since 1995, Knowledge has his 
hands in almost every aspect of the electronic music industry. On top of 
his impressive DJ credentials which includes shows all over the US and 
Canada, he also runs one of the east coasts premiere production 
companies. To date, he has thrown over 75 parties and runs a successful 
club night in CT. Knowledge has produced material released on K:cid and is 
working on another release for 2003. His first fully licensed CD will be 
out in 2003 and he will be giving away plenty of free promos of his latest 
demo - LIVE AT BOO 7. His style is one that fuses together techo, house, 
progressive and tribal. Knowledge continues to be one of the driving 
forces behind the success of the east coast movement and it is our 
pleasure to bring him to Southwest, Ohio. Check out some of his live sets 
on www.columnsofknowledge.com

www.4-score.com / www.gspentertainment.com, Nashville, TN - Back in Ohio 
once again, this mixin' master is ready to throw down like never before. 
Combining all styles of breaks into his set, you will see for yourself why 
he took home first place in the Spin Cycle DJ Battle in Louisville, KY 
last year. His flawless mixing and scratching tactics are sure to leave 
you in awe. Once he is behind the decks you will know the vibe is alive!

as Ming & Fs, Soulslinger, TC Islam and Dieselboy, to name a few. Ben has 
spent the last year spreading the rinsed out mash'em up koncrete message 
with the Ill Factor along with the Spacemen in and around Florida. His 
Ohio appearance will not be one to miss.

KITSONIK: House, Breakbeat, 2Step, Trance www.unifiedent.com, 
www.wellknowndjs.com,
www.airplaneclique.com - Cincinnati, OH The Kitsonik sound is a moving 
progressive blend of Breaks, House, 2Step and Trance. She is known for 
both her energetic and sassy presence behind the decks and her ability to 
throw down and almost any style of music flawlessly. There is never a dull 
moment when she performs and she likes to keep the crowd on their toes by 
layering different musical genres. This flexibility is also shown through 
her mixed CDs where she has released 2 House/2Step and 2 Trance 
compilations, her latest being Hearthouse II.

D8A: SPECIAL OLD SCHOOL ACID HOUSE SET - www.groovereactor.com, Buckwyld - 
Dayton, OH - Over time, D8A has developed a unique style that always 
pleases. Ranging from the hardest hitting house and on into harder German 
techno/ trance, you can always expect to see the crowd dancing during his 
sets. Tonight though, D8A is preparing a special treat NOT TO BE MISSED. 
He will be dropping an ultra-rare acid house set with some of those 
long-ago heard gems and recent underground acid tracks that will truly 
take you BACK TO THE BASICS. If you were around in the glory days of acid 
house and like the older styles of DJ Pierre or Terry Mullan, this will be 
the set you've been wanting to hear!

NELSON: www.glasscityrecords.com / Black Sun Entertainment - Funky Disco 
House, Toledo, OH - Nelson is one of the biggest supporters and proponents 
of the NW, Ohio scene and he's developed the scene into something special. 
Including the launch of his own Glass City Records, his NW, Ohio message 
board www.glasscityrecords.com and his successful run of club and one-off 
events, it's no wonder the word is quickly spreading. His funky-filtered 
house sounds will surely keep everyone begging for more.

MATT ROBERTS: Unpredictable Entertainment / Glass City Records - Techno - 
Toledo, OH - Matt will be bringing some down the hard techno sounds from 
Toledo and will be drawing on the Detroit influences who have made the 
sound what it is today. Plenty of wicked drum codes and percussion, 
combined with his flawless mixing will surely help to set the tone of the 
party.

CATNAP vs. DEF LEPER: Mecha Studios - Hardcore, Gabber, Who Knows - 
Columbus & Springfield, OH - There is no question that when these two take 
the stage the sparks will fly. Expect to be entertained with audio and 
visual sensations of hardcore, gabber, and noisecore and a little bit of 
everything in between. Plenty of people have asked for another tag team 
between these two see get here early to hear them duke it out!

OOMPA LOOMPA: Trance - Cincinnati, OH - Oompa has made quite a name for 
himself this past year and the demand to see him spin increases every 
weekend. He brought some major bombs down at Bumpin and Jumpin 2 and it's 
our pleasure to bring him in again for some more mayhem!

SEIJI
(Bugz in the Attic, UK)

As a founding member of the Bugz in the Attic crew, Seiji is one of the principal players in the broken beat scene.

The list goes on and on. Seiji's reputation as a DJ has also been on the rapid increse over the past two years, touring Japan with 4Hero's Dego, taking in 2 US tours, and playing around the UK and Europe every week at some of the top clubs and events.

*CD Scratch 1200 v1.00.007 [972k] W9x/2k/XP FREE*

http://cdscratch.com/

{Virtual CD player} Instead of dreaming of a white Christmas, are you 
dreaming of becoming a DJ? Funky down with CD Scratch and simultaneously 
play two songs from the same CD, even with one going forward and one 
going backwards. Imitate those DJs and scratch CDs back and forth 
(lookin' cool in your shades) and blow Puffy away. Create your own mix 
and DJ the next party like a pro. Put the CD into the drive and the 
music plays while a record spins on your screen. The mouse is the tool 
for scratching and to change the tempo and pitch. Finally, listen to 
those lyrics that supposedly play when putting an album in reverse mode, 
or make an annoying band sound better (or worse). Sounds slick! [Meryl]

It's interesting, and it's cool how you can control the compressor 
and stuff, but there's just one big flaw in it.  There's no way to 
beat match.  The cue channel is "for other products" and there's no 
way of finding a bpm.  Still fun to play around with, though :D

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} re: settlements

When I think about how much damage one could do to a person with the
information that they request in the claim form, it makes me wonder if this
isnt just some sort of scam.  Is this even real? With this information on a
person, not only can they find out just about any record of a person, they
may even be able to get into many accounts the applicant might have.  The
info they ask, is the exact security info a call center would ask if your
trying to access accounts over the phone.  (school records, web page
accounts, credit check, utility bills, bank accounts, ect.) Call me paranoid
if you will.  $5 just isnt worth the risk of having somebody possibly hack
my personal life, let alone the least, tons of spam mail i could get.

  That's very easy. You simply have to do it very matter of factly, in =

deliver
  the compliment that is critical - the best thing to do is render it in =
such
  a way that the recipient doesn't even realize it's a compliment until =
after
  the fact. If you're too intense and render the compliment as the axis =
of
  conversation, the recipient is made to feel uncomfortable because zie =
must

a very

  With respect to the stewardess, "I don't know what to say - lovely =

  "Do you mind if I have a glass of wine?"
  "Would you like one?"

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} maybe interesting toy?

I've bene playing with it for a while at the very least it's fun to 
play with the compressor by doing things like turning down the volume 
and wait for the automatic gain to get it back to normal volumes then 
quickly jack up the volume and watch the compressor freak out :D  The 
record noise is interesting too, doesn't put these loud clicks, but 
tiny ones that make it sound like a record.  The autoplay works nice 
too, so there isn't any gaps between tracks.  Like I mentioned 
earlier, the mixing aspect is flawed, but if you can get the timing 
down you can play the same track on both "tables" and do effects to 
one of them.  At the very least it's got me interested in compressors 
and processors and stuff again.  Even looked at some of the 
schematics to build your own, although those look like they only 
handle the noise gate stuff and just stops you from blowing up the 
speakers.  Wouldn't mind having one, but even the cheapies are still 
in the $100's though, right?  Think I'll stick to the freebie :D

behringer and samson make sub-100$ compressors.  i'd pick the samsons 
out of the 2.   everyone everywhere rants like mad about the 199$ R.N.C. 
(really nice compressor)....  a simple handbuilt compressor that 
supposedly is the hot ticket for a cheap compressor.

but theres nothing like a ghetto 50$ compressor to level off the volume 
of a teevee   =)

I have removed myself from your list every single time I get a message.

Less than a week later I get your spam once again. EVERY TIME!

You've indicated that some people are on your list who didn't request it.

I am one of those people, and I have tried to give you the benefit of the 
doubt.

PLEASE TAKE ME OFF YOUR GODDAMNED, FUCKING MAILING LIST!!!

I hope that this gets my point across. There are other ways to express my 
displeasure with your domain in a technological fashion, but I hope that we 
can keep from going there.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} have you checked it out yet?

Downloaded, checked it out.

Pretty decent. I'm not a big fan of that style of DnB, it's a bit too dark
and menacing and metalic for me (this isn't a dis, but it kind of strikes me
as the electronica equivalent of heavy metal). About halfway in, it started
to get a bit funkier and slightly melodic. I dug that more.

I dug the one sample about 12:30 into it...I know I've heard that track
before....can't put a name on it.

The mixing was mostly on-point. Needs a little sharpening up, but that comes
with experience. Practice, practice, practice.

The scratching was good. I haven't heard stuff like that blended with some
hard DnB before, it's an interesting mix. I'd say spread it out more
throughout the mix. Used sparingly and to the right effect, that could
heighten the intensity of a set quite a bit.

Keep up the work, man.

One more interesting note, if you still use winamp2, there's a 
compressor/limiter plug in for it.  Makes all mp3's at the same 
volume.  (don't think there's one out yet for winamp3)

didn't like it that much.  But I've never seen these DJ's and I'm into prog.

How'd you like it?  I thought the guys did an awesome job.  If you like prog....it's a great place to get your fill.  
Weather was a bummer.....missed a few faces because of it.  
Definitely a chill night however, and some very cool people came down.
Amy...David.....you guys really worked hard and it showed.  Mwwah.  Here it comes...that "thank you" moment. lol.
btw...David handed out some Cd's.  Took a listen this morning....very nice.  deep. dark.

and just what is wrong with heavy metal?  nothing that's what!

lol, i love the dark shit.  I did like the scratching too.  Only thing i 
don't like about some of the dark dnb tracks like that is they have allot of 
bleepie annoying shit going on int he high frequencies.  Its like a nice 
dark roller that could be funky and they fill it with suposed scifi high 
pitched synth lines and ruin it a bit.

BTW, think you need to make a few of those mixes match a bit quicker.  not 
bad though

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} djmoose - "A Love Letter" in a record store near you!

This cd is pretty cool, I got it a couple months ago.  It's got 
some good fun tracks.  And I love the tracklisting concept, which 
is the reason for the cd name.

Even better idea...
If you guys want to see Satoshi  he's playing even earlier on Feb 15th, then stick around to see Paul Van Dyk on the 16th.  Both at The Factory...aka...Mekka.
oooooh. VanDyk.  Just too cool.  Going to be quite a night.

Subject: {pb-cle} History Of Drum 'n' Bass

I dont know how many of you on here saw this, but I just checked it out a 
couple days ago.  Its a bunch of mixes tracing drum n bass from pre 1990 
to 2001.  Pretty interesting stuff, I got to hear a lot of old stuff that I 
didnt even know or had forgotten that existed.  Definitely worth checking 
out if youre into jungle/dnb.  All mixes are real media files, but can be 
easily download and converted to .wav > .mp3 if you want to burn them or 
listen on an mp3 player.  Enjoy.

files, but can be easily download and converted to .wav > .mp3 if you
want to burn them or listen on an mp3 player.  Enjoy.

interesting article in the tribune review, can't believe they 
printed this shit......



Socialism: Its evil permeates American society

"Socialism is involved in the redistribution of income, which is 
just a polite way of saying robbery. A bank robber is more direct 
and honest. He does not say he is redistributing the bank's money. 
He plainly demands it for himself. "

Subject: {pb-cle} Abbasso this past weekend...

Thanks to any and all who came out on Friday and
Saturday...those who braved the weather made for a
good vibe both evenings (although Saturday was a bit
more frenetic - Friday was the chilled-down evening of
the two).  Amy and Dave put forth a great effort with
the first ::True:: evening and the crowd for Evan
Evolution and Jason Alias was one of the more
interesting ones we've had in the last month or so. 
I'm looking forward to seeing both nights build up
with more concerted promotional efforts by the staff
and friends in the coming weeks.  We're also starting
to see more DJ's come down for 'Local' - Thursday's
open table night - check the weeklies listing for info
if you're interested.

If anyone else was out at Abbasso this past weekend, 
feel free to send your comments - We'd like to get
others' impressions of the place and direction we're
taking.

Thanks,
Jamie

This is fantastic. Thanks for forwarding.

It's good to hear a lot of this stuff again. I miss the days of Altern-8 and
early Orbital and Prodigy.

I remember getting acid house mix tapes in the mail from my cousins who
lived in Germany at the time...that's the first time I'd heard Voodoo Ray
and Pacific State...aaaahhh, to be young and impressionable again.

I dont know how many of you on here saw this, but I just checked it out a
couple days ago.  Its a bunch of mixes tracing drum n bass from pre 1990
to 2001.  Pretty interesting stuff, I got to hear a lot of old stuff that I
didnt even know or had forgotten that existed.  Definitely worth checking
out if youre into jungle/dnb.  All mixes are real media files, but can be
easily download and converted to .wav > .mp3 if you want to burn them or
listen on an mp3 player.  Enjoy.

For those that don't get groovetech.com's mailings, they are having a 
sale right now that is "up to 50% off" So you may want to check it 
out to see if there's anything of interest.  I don't have any money, 
so I'm not even going to that site :D  the address is 
www.groovetech.com

P.S.  The preceeding was NOT a paid advertisement by groovetech

anyhow, email me if you're going, and i'll keep a list.

It *IS* in cleveland, yes.

Someone also mentioned that there will be reduced admission tickets
available at HOUSE if you want to attend both events, since HOUSE ends at
2:30 am.  I don't know if this is true or not, but I'll try to find out.

I am going to try to talk to rave trash (cincy/columbus/dayton rave list) 
into having a netmeet at the same time.  It will be cool to meet some of the 
other people who make up our ohio scene.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} electronic sensation .netmeet

if it is, its worth it to go just for titonton and paradox.
paradox's live shows are off the hizzy from what i hear, though
ive never seen one in person, the video that came with his
"musician as outsider" LP was nuts. and titonton is just the man.
id almost consider going to a rave to attend this if i didnt have
to work.

Court dates for ravers canceled
Racine prosecutors in talks with ACLU to resolve cases
By TOM KERTSCHER
tkertscher@journalsentinel.com
Last Updated: Jan. 10, 2003
Racine - The ravers may win yet.

Two months ago, police issued $968 citations to more than 440 people
who attended a rave, a party with distinctive music - and, often,
drugs - that teens and young adults will drive hours to attend.

News of the crackdown shocked the rave community nationwide, and the
Racine City Attorney's Office quickly offered to reduce the
forfeiture to $100. Then it offered to remove any reference to
controlled substances from the ticket.

But most of the ravers refused the plea bargain, leaving the city
with the potentially costly prospect of holding hundreds of trials.

Now the city has blinked again.

Some 75 pretrial conferences scheduled for Friday and other Municipal
Court proceedings for the citations were canceled. Instead, city
prosecutors are negotiating with American Civil Liberties Union
attorneys in an effort to resolve the cases.

None of the attorneys would comment Friday on the talks.

At this stage, some of the ravers think it's increasingly likely that
the citations could be dismissed.

"I think that means either they're withdrawing their (plea bargain)
offers or they know they're wrong and they're going to end up
dropping it, which is how I think it will end up going," said Crystal
Sheets, 20, of Kansasville, whose Friday pretrial conference was
canceled. "I don't think anything is going to come of this. I'm not
worried about it."

Mayor Jim Smith and Police Chief David Spenner couldn't be reached
for comment. But two of Smith's challengers in next month's primary
think the city should just drop the citations.

"I agree that the party probably did get out of hand, but I think
they've taken it too far, and I think they're wasting the taxpayers'
money," said political newcomer Laurie Kell.

Added County Supervisor Ken Lumpkin, another mayoral candidate: "I
think they should cut their losses and walk away from it."

U.S. Customs officials had shared a tip with Racine police that drugs
would be at a Racine tavern that held the Nov. 2 rave, which also was
promoted as a fund-raiser for a nearby theater. About 20 police
officers descended and spent a few hours writing the tickets, also
arresting three men on drug charges in the process.

Police said the party-goers violated the city's "inmate of a
disorderly house" ordinance because drug activity was apparent to all
in attendance.

The ACLU's success in stalling the prosecutions should help convince
people around that country that not all raves are drug-filled, said
Chicago rave promoter Dave Meeker. Until now, only ravers and their
backers touted that line, he said.

"I think it brings a little more legitimacy to the entire argument
that everyone who goes to a rave party isn't a drug addict, that you
can go to these parties and not do drugs and that it's a violation of
your civil liberties" to be ticketed for merely attending, Meeker
said.

Sheets said that if the citations were dismissed, she could see
another rave being held in Racine. But the others interviewed
disagreed, saying that however the cases are resolved, Racine's
handling of the party would encourage any future rave promoter to
hold the party somewhere else.

"I probably would think twice about it," Assistant City Attorney
Scott Lewis said.

Ahh, good old Meeker. I miss that guy.

His off the cuff analogies, which get even better around noon at an after 
party, crack me the hell up.

He'll seem off on some tangent and then just tie all of it together. He's a 
pleasure to talk to. Still in Chi-town?

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} have you checked it out yet?

I never really noticed the "heavy metal" sound in my mix but I can't say
I don't like it either. I know the mixes to be a little more on but I am
currently spinnin on two Stanton str8-60s(the straight arm tables)which
are 2 years old and a Stanton sk-2 skratch mixer( so my flaws can be
explained somewhat by my gear). Thanks for those of you who took some
time to give it a listen, I will let you all know when I get a new mix
out ;-)!

and just what is wrong with heavy metal?  nothing that's what!

lol, i love the dark shit.  I did like the scratching too.  Only thing i

don't like about some of the dark dnb tracks like that is they have
allot of 
bleepie annoying shit going on int he high frequencies.  Its like a nice

dark roller that could be funky and they fill it with suposed scifi high

pitched synth lines and ruin it a bit.

BTW, think you need to make a few of those mixes match a bit quicker.
not 
bad though

Subject: {pb-cle} Campbell Tyler / Matt Lee || In The Mix 88.1-FM Thursday ||

**********|| In The Mix || *******|| Thursdays ||**********
-----------------------------------------------------------

This week on In The Mix ------------>>>

Campbell Tyler- Hard House

Since the heyday of underground raves (in DC, the Catastrophic parties, the 
first Buzz and Fever parties), Campbell attained to be behind the decks. 
Begining at house parties in the 90's, Campbell found himself living in the 
world dance mecca, London. Campbell and his brother acquired a top notch set 
of records that were, literally, before their time for the Washington, DC 
scene. The dance floors were in constant motion after spinning at a few 
unofficial guest spots at the Circle and Zei Club, both venues now gone. The 
floors have not stopped moving....and the rest is history.

Campbell spins tunes ranging from Hard pumping Trance to NuNRG and 
Progressive House. Some of the labels you will find in Campbell's case 
include Nukleuz, Eve, Noom, and Tinrib. Rarely a boring or repetitive track 
is heard in the set, but if one is heard, it will likely have a wicked 
build-up and nice layers.

Campbell has graced the DJ booth at parties ranging from small exotic places 
like Guernsey, to huge venues such as Biosphere, Vienna. However, Campbell 
continues to please his hometown audience in Washington, DC as often as 
possible. Campbell also currently enjoys playing at gigs along the East 
Coast and in Europe.



Matt Lee - House

A newcomer to the scene, Matt Lee brings with him a wide range of influences 
and a love for all things deep. With influences such as radiohead to aphex 
twin, Matt's style materializes into the form of deep, techy progressive 
house. Not afraid of melodies, or vocals, Matt defies conventional wisdom, 
ignoring top dj's, and pursuing what he deems quality. When behind the 
decks, he'll genre hop inside the window of house, and your sure to hear 
tracks never before exposed to your ears and soul.

greeted by a nude, well-endowed man who said something flirtatious

um, i cant think of specific examples... 3d is the high pitched

daddy g is the lower voiced black guy. and horace andy is the guy 
with the strange ass voice, and the girls are all girls.

Under streaming mixes....  well, it's not a mix (a mix down, yes), it's more of an 8 minute track called "Light Pressure".  Download, let me know your thoughts and ideas.

Also, any ideas for the new set for this month?  Anything anyone wanna hear?  Name a few and I'll see what I can do!

Anyone willing to split a business opportunity for a record label contact me.  Timeline: 5-11 months (one month less than last time, of course)

Yeah okay, it doesn't bother me that daddy g left then.

3d and Horace pretty much are massive attack to me.

and the girls.

Honestly, I didn't expect 3d to be white.

Yeah I think Field Day needs to be off the hizzy.

I am camping out for as long as possible.

My entire life even.

SOMEONE BRING US BACK THE RAVE AFTER WE SET US UP THE BASE

What a horrible night to have a curse.

>Yeah okay, it doesn't bother me that daddy g left then.

i dont know man. i saw some little interview with 3d somewhere and
he said that daddy g will be back for future massive attack stuff,
i dont know what happened to him here. if i remember correctly, he
did the "my ak rig goes boom boom boom, my ak rig goes boom" line
on blue lines, and that shit was so hot it hurts. 

>3d and Horace pretty much are massive attack to me.

you realise of course that horace andy is like in his 50's, and
was originally a straight up reggae singer? massive attack cover
buttloads of his tracks, thats how he got hooked up with them. 

>and the girls.

they all rotate, and they all sound perfectly at home. and sinead
sounds fucking excellent on the new one (just got the MP3s, i love
the internet). 

>Honestly, I didn't expect 3d to be white.

ill admit i was pretty suprised when i discovered that. 

also, its not been mentioned, but i got the massive attack "11
promos" dvd when it came out earlier this year. its got all the
videos from blue lines to mezzanine, and theyre all pretty fucking
intense, some bordering on amazing. im about to go watch some of
it now........

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} unity

Unity was the first *real* rave i ever went too. I actually ended up 
getting stranded there in the middle of west virginia because my ride got 
too tripped out and ran away. I was having so much fun though,  I didn't 
even care. Eventually I found someone heading to pittsburgh and hitched a 
ride. Good thing too because I was flat broke at the time.

You have pics? Please share. I would love to reminisce =)

I could tell that Horace was a reggae singer. Hes got some pretty chill 
tunes, though sometimes his voice gets on my nerves. He sounds *uber* on 
"Angel" but I also think he sounds like shit on the "Man who lives next 
door" live track. I don't know wether that was on the original cd or not, I 
dl'd all of those from audiogalaxy.

I am looking forward to hearing Sinead. I will contact you via slsk later 
on. Oh, you know it.

No matter who cries about this party, it's something good for the city.  with PNC's help maybe this can be a yearly thing and get something like detroit music festival thing going on.  although the price is high... people will come.  if you build it ravers will rave.  the line up isn't something to laugh at.  i wish there where more drum and base... that's another story though.  this should be supported 

 

 

peace

aside from the fact that anyone who really tried to throw that in
pgh would lost so many thousands of dollars that PNC couldnt even
bail their asses out, this shit seemed so fake from the get go. i
mean seriously, this is pgh in the year 2003. 

and anyway, had it been real, your attitude towards it fucking
sucks. it wouldnt be good for anything at all. 

im still glad raves are dead,

that track is hot, i dont know what youre talking about : P 

the only even questionable massive attack track is the "light my

listening to it though.

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO

 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

element 5 + the Andy Warhol Museum

present...  International Recording Artist

Moonstarr

in a live performance with special guests:

Anthony Fugate   on percussion
Hill Jordan   on horns
Davu   on poetics
Tash   on vocals

Fri Jan 17th, 2003

(5pm Door / 7pm show / $3 Cover)

@ The Warhol:
117 Sandusky St.
Pittsburgh, PA

Only in Toronto, Canada do West London, Detroit, Sao Paolo, Kingston, Hong 
Kong and New York City blend together so smoothly. Nowhere is this 
cultural melting pot more apparent than Dupont Street in downtown Toronto. 
It's only fitting that Toronto native, Kevin Moon a.k.a Moonstarr, named 
his first full-length solo album after the famed street. Combining musical 
influences as diverse as DJ premier (hip-hop), The Sun Ra Arkestra (Jazz), 
Baden Powell (Bossa Nova), and Underground Resistance (Detroit Techno), 
Moonstarr's unique sound has made a splash on the global electronic and nu 
jazz scenes in recent years. His music and live performances have earned 
him praise from veterans of the international scene including Gilles 
Peterson, Rainer Trüby, Laurent Garnier, Jazzanova, 4Hero and DJ Spinna.

After his first release, 1997's Hexed on Wha?naut Records, Moonstarr saw a 
lull in the electronic music scene in Toronto. It was while previewing 
demo tapes of local musicians during subway commutes to his day job that 
Moonstarr decided to start his own record label. In 1998, he approached a 
circle of musicians and friends from a local community radio station to 
form Public Transit Recordings. Unfortunately, the founding of an 
independent record label meant Moonstarr's own music would take a back 
seat for a while to other priorities. The result, however, was a string of 
CD and vinyl 12" releases, including the Code:416 and Blue Night Network 
compliations featuring various artists, the MetroPass EP, and full-length 
album by Asian-fusion duo LAL.   Public Transit Recordings earned 
considerable praise locally and internationally, not only for the music 
which received heavy rotation on college radio, but also a 
socially-conscious theme underlying the label's creative mindset.

"We coined our label Public Transit as a statement on a huge problem 
plaguing our communities," explains Moonstarr. "Toronto, like any other 
city, is being choked by car pollution while funding for public 
transportation is continuously slashed. The automobile and suburban sprawl 
encourages people to live a more insular lifestyle. In turn, you can't 
help but feel a negative impact on the [music] scene with that kind of 
culture."  Indeed, Moonstarr's live shows have often included stock 
footage of urban development films from the 70s along with songs of wild 
birds and humpback whales interwoven with the music mix. Moonstarr has 
also helped organize fundraising events for environmental charities, often 
giving patrons a discount or drink special if they present a valid bus 
transfer. "The subway-transit theme is our way of spotlighting a more 
positive vision for a vibrant urban culture. It appears not just in our 
music and live shows, but as an underlying concept in all aspects of work 
we do."

With the strides Moonstarr made in 2002, 2003 looks to be a banner year 
with new compositions and recordings on the horizon, remixes for 
Jazzanova, Recloose, and Todd Sines, and an upcoming collaboration with 
some members of the Sun Ra Arkestra. A past participant in element 5 urban 
culture collective's Momentum series, Moonstarr returns to the City of 
Bridges (Pittsburgh) for an intimate live performance with musicians 
Anthony Fugate (Drumz 4u) on percussion, Hill Jordan (Hardgroove 
Project/Versus) on horns, Davu (Hip-Hop Café Series) on poetics, Tash 
(Public Transit Recordings) on Vocals, with DJs Ed-Umm (The Warhol:) and 
the soundcrews of Public Transit Recordings and Technoir-Audio Records. 
The night will be taking place Friday January 17th, 2003 at the legendary 
Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, PA.

The event is part of Good Fridays at the Warhol:   5pm door, 7pm show, $3

Global Adrenaline and Northstar Ent. presents
Stardust 3

40 DJs | 4 Rooms | 1 Experience

An event that began some three years ago has continually raised the bar
and changed the face of events throughout the Midwest. The "Stardust"
experience has come to mean many different things to each of us, but to
all of us it has come to mean that one day of the year where our
generation can come together in the celebration of free spirit, great
music, and escape the not so always thrilling world that is life.

Serving as an outlet for world-renowned talent, "Stardust" focuses on
what is great about music. It serves to prove, that electronic music as a
whole and all of its influences are a mainstay in our culture, no matter
who wants to deny that fact. "Stardust" will set the tone for events to
come in 2003. On Sunday, January 19th, come share with us the experience
that is "Stardust".

Featuring...

Mirco is an active participant on the tour of the same name.

TALENT:
Kevin Reynolds: Live Pa/Techno - Detroit, MI
Kevin is one of the best Techno artist that has ever came across the 
Mid-West and Detroit. His Funky and exhilerating style produced live will 
keep you dancing.
Thomas James: Residual Recordings - Deep House/Min. Techno - Columbus, OH
Thomas James is co-owner, with Titonton Duvante, of Residual Recordings. 
Founded in 1998, Residual is recognized worldwide for it's consistent deep 
house, and melodic techno grooves. The impressive Residual discography
boasts releases by accomplished artists such as Boo Williams, John Tejada, 
Dan Curtin, Fabrice Lig, Todd Sines and Titonton. As a DJ, Thomas James is 
known for his impecable taste in deep house, melodic and minimal techno. 
His track selection inspires and his skill motivates. Thomas has held 
residencies at Axis (Columbus), Club 504 (Columbus), Touch (Cleveland) and 
is currently half the force behind columbus' first all live electronic 
monthly event, Proceed. As host of these evenings, international caliber 
guests have included Kit Clayton, Glenn Underground, DJ Swamp, Dan Bell, 
John Tejada, Robert Hood and Hannah to name a few. Future plans include 
new 
releases on Residual, and another return to Europe where he's played in 
Switzerland and Spain.
JJ BOOGIE: www.wellknowndjs.com / www.groovereactor.com Groovereactor - 
Trance & House - Cincinnati, OH
A veteran behind the decks now in his 7th year, JJ BOOGIE
is one of the names to watch in 2003. Having been booked all over the US 
and in Canada - look for a fresh set of the top dance tracks you will ever 
hear. His peak time sets create an amazing energy and you can expect the 
whole room to be dancing non-stop. He's now touring to support the release 
of his recent mixed CD - GENESIS and his upcoming vinyl album on his own 
Groove Reactor Records.
Quantum: Mythodic/CEG/Ritual - House/Progressive - Columbus, OH
To most DJs, the term "perfectionist" would seem a mighty compliment, but 
not to Columbus' DJ Quantum. To him, the word doesn't begin to convey his 
meticulous attention to detail when mixing; he is, in his own words, "More 
like an 'Obsessive-Compulsive Mix Freak.'" Citing eclectic musical tastes, 
Quantum's syrupy-smooth style is derived from musical influences like 
Danny 
Tenaglia, John Digweed and Steve Lawler. Much like the aforementioned 
artists, in his sets he stresses song selection and programming above 
tricks and gimmicks.
Nostalgic: Downtown Entertainment - Funky Breaks - Dayton, OH
Aus-10: Ascension DJ's - Intelligent DNB - Columbus, OH
NautiKat: Ascension DJ's - Female UK Hard House/Trance - Columbus, OH

SEIJI
(Bugz in the Attic, UK)

As a founding member of the Bugz in the Attic crew, Seiji is one of the 
principal players in the broken beat scene. Originally known for recording 
drum'n'bass records, his profile is now mainly due to his work as Seiji, 
Opaque and as part of Bugz in the Attic. Among some fleeting guises he's 
also recorded soulful house as Homecookin', Everyday People and USC for a 
wide selection of labels including Bitasweet Records, 2000 Black, 
Ubiquity, 4Hero's Reinforced, PaPa, Talkin Loud, Visions, Sonar Kollektiv, 
Laws of Motion, Versatile, and Archive. The list goes on and on. Seiji's 
reputation as a DJ has also been on the rapid increse over the past two 
years, touring Japan with 4Hero's Dego, taking in 2 US tours, and playing 
around the UK and Europe every week at some of the top clubs and events.

Sat Feb 01                           TRU                           Columbus

After much consideration I have decided to move all Rise events from Red 
Zone to 382 West Nationwide Blvd. known as Mekka, The Music Factory, The 
Factory, and the former Glow. 
To avoid legal complications I am switching the Rise name to Tru. All 
further events will be billed as Tru at the Factory. With the new space 
the level of production will be unlike anything before done in Columbus. 
The sound system is the same EAW line array system that most major touring 
acts bring with them for Arena shows. All lighting, laser, and visuals 
will be completely installed and programmed in time for Feb. 1. We have 
many plans to take the experience to the next level. You will be both 
pleased and hopefully amazed at what we plan to do. The talent lineup is 
among the top in the World. The first Tru event is Saturday Feb. 1st. 
To those of you who have been to Mekka in the last 6 weeks a few things.

1) The sound, what is currently in the venue is on loan from EAW. The far 
superior Line Array system was custom built for the room, and arrives and 
is installed the second week of January. It will amaze you with its 
clarity, and power.

2) Lights, 4 Mac 2000's have been on back order and arrive mid January, 
the current light show is less than 1/2 of what it will be.

3) Laser, It has not been programmed, or ulitized to 20% of its capability 
yet, Feb. 1, be prepared!!

4)Stage, headlining talent will be featured on stage, with full 
production. You will understand Feb. 1

5) visuals, Feb. 1

I ask for you support in this change, I feel that it is a positive 
evolution for the scene. I intend to surpass the quality level that has 
made Rise so successful.

Saturday, Feb. 1 The Premier of Tru at the Factory.

Talent:

BT (Exclusive DJ set)

Sat Feb 01                   WISHING ON A STAR 3                     Dayton

Wishing Well & GrooveFuel LLC present
Wishing on a Star 3: Wishing Well 2 Year Anniversary
Dayton, OH - February 1, 2003

_hosted all night by Mc Jumper

_featuring the follow up to the Get Down tour, "The Feel The Rhythm Tour" 
with Paul Johnson and Translucent

_Paul_Johnson_(Dusttraxx)_Chicago
Paul has not let the wheelchair he is confined to slow him down in the 
studio or behind the decks. "Get Down", one of the hottest house tunes 
ever produced was played by everyone and their momma's. He will be 
releasing the follow up track, "Feel the Rhythm" on this awesome night so 
listen for it and be able to say "I was at the event where that track was 
released."

_Translucent_(Transparent, Dusttraxx)_Chicago
This very talented musician lays down the dopest house cuts and is a house 
legend in many eyes. Just wait til' he pulls out the trumpet and blows you 
away with the soul.

_Teebee_(Metalheadz, Subtitles, Certificate 18 )_Norway
DJ/producer Teebee spent ten years making his mark on the Norwegian drum 
'n' bass scene, but it only took one album and a handful of singles (on 
labels like Rugged Vinyl and Moving Shadow) to establish him as a major 
player in the elitist UK drum 'n' bass scene. Teebee now needs no 
introduction. He's become one of the major successes of the UK's 
forward-thinking Certificate 18 label, as well as winning the "Best 
International Producer" award from Knowledge Magazine in 2001. He's had 
releases on numerous labels, including Prototype, Juice, Creative Source, 
Moving Shadow, and many more, as well as releasing several mysteriously 
haunting R&B-flavored drum 'n' bass bootlegs. Additionally, he plays DJ 
gigs around the world, creating a stir with head-banging sets that run the 
gamut between dark and melodic sounds. More so than most DJs, he really 
gets involved in his sets, dancing about, pumping his fists, and 
transmitting an intense energy to the crowd.

_Venom_(Volume Prod.)_New Jersey
I have an idea that he is going to break out the live p.a. for this show 
and if you haven't seen it you are about to be amazed. This guy is so 
talented it isn't funny. Just wait as the dnb fused live show rocks you 
off your feet.

_The_Untouchables_-_Flagrant,_Sterling_+_Chango-Fatt_(Mustard 
Records-Australia)
Dopest hip hop duo with mc coming staight from the down under with mad 
Australian clothing giveaways. Flagrant and Sterling tore it up at Wishing 
2 now they are back to burn the tables down.

_Jen_Lasher_(Object Oriented Bliss, GrooveFuel AM)_www.groovefuel.com
A member of the Object-Oriented Bliss DJ collective and recently signed to 
GrooveFuel AM, Jen Lasher has come into her own as one of America's 
Breakbeat up and comers. Her smooth mixing skills and taste in phat beats 
have recently gained the attention of ReleaseArtistManagement, an 
international DJ roster as well as independent record label that works 
with many of the worlds top producers and DJs including Jackal & Hyde, 
Hyper, & Rick West.

Jen is no stranger to music production, not only is she contributing 
vocals to the next DJ Icey artist compilation, she's also working with 
Icey on a new track to be released in 2003. To top it all off, Jen keeps 
her style original and unique by incorporating her own tracks and vocals 
into DJ sets. In addition to her national tour dates, you can catch her at 
her residency in Baltimore, MD at Ultraworld's, Sonar Lounge. You don't 
want to miss Jen dropping her dope beats at Wishing on a Star 3.

_Nautigroove_(In The Groove)_Cincinnati
The man behind In The Groove and a soon to be family member, Jason lays 
down whatever it takes to make the crowd melt in his hands. If you have a 
love for music the way we do you do not want to miss this set so be ready 
to be taken into a state of pure bliss by the sounds of this expert.

_Sparky_Killabrew_(Wishing Well, Well Known)_KY
Sparky is coming to us off his last show opening for Nappy Roots and 
10,000 raging people. His turntablist tricks and beat juggling combined 
with his dope underground hip hop track selection, you better not miss it. 
He made his debut at the first Wishing and is now back to rock the joint.

_Rob_Riddum_(GF Music Factory)_Cleveland
Rob Riddum is one of the most well known and dedicated dnb djs in the Ohio 
scene today. The legacy began in 1996 as Riddum took his funky set to the 
streets as member of the popular Elements Squad. Now after producing 
tracks for Jackass and making a strong surge in the last year Rob is 
taking it to the next level.

_Dank_One_(Better Days, Alkaline Sound)Louisville
The man behind A*S*S, the sound system that will be rocking rooms in 
Dayton from now on, Kevin will be laying many drum and bass tracks of his 
and many other producers, that are on the cutting edge of the dnb genre.

_Lil'_Cory_(NateFx)_Lexington, KY
Cory has been itching to hit Ohio on the house tip so let's rock. He will 
be hitting us hard with a dope booty house set that is guaranteed not to 
disappoint anyone. Get ready to "Hit it From the Back".

_Matt_Freeman_(Flashpoint, Illuminators)_Dayton
Matt has been rocking the decks long enough to know, that he rocks the 
decks. Making his 3rd straight Wishing On A Star appearance make some 
noise for the man who never disappoints.

_Nimby_(American Cheese)_Cincinnati_w/_Mc Jumper_(Neutral Music, 
RPC)_Rochester
This is the first time these happy hardcore gurus will perform together so 
be sure not to miss this set. Nimby has been setting the standard for 
hardcore in Ohio for the past couple of years and is now ready to "Rise to 
the Top" like a "Shooting Star" as he throws down an oldskool anthem set.

_Dorian_(4-Score, Inneraction, Vinyl Beats)_Nashville, Tennessee
A staple in the Nashville DnB scene since 1997, Dorian's mixing and 
scratching technique will leave you in awe. We're not one to gossip, but 
word has it, he is a master at toe scratching.

_Centrex_(Unified Ent, Breakline Crew)_Cincinnati
His mixing is flawless and the track selection will make your body butta 
from dancin'. Letting people know that breaks is on the rise, Tom is one 
part of the infamous Breakline Crew consisting of Cyberspeed, Clay-Born, 
Kitsonik, Bobby Bedlam, APX, Breakthrough, and Annalyze.

_Clay-Born_(Wishing Well, Breakline Crew)_Louisville
He might play alot of Wishing Well/Groovefuel events but he never fails to 
rock it and is our little buddy who we rescued from the sounds of hard 
house a couple of years ago. That's right if you were at Shamrock in 
Columbus you saw him rip some Uk Hard House, but that is all in the past.

_Foursqare_(Wishing Well, Hushabye House)_Louisville
Marea has taken her love for house music to a whole new level. Now one of 
the best house djs our area has to offer, she has created a following of 
househeads, partykids, and just plain music enthusiasts that just can't 
help but shake their booties to the sounds of "The Lady".

_Subnet_(GF Music Factory)_Cincinnati
Music Factory introduces Subnet... Rooted in progressive styles of house 
and trance, the signature Subnet sound has evolved to a banging techno 
that is nothing short of cutting edge. Impressive to even the most savvy 
ear, his sound is grounded in fresh, energetic track selection and 
seamless mixing. Everyone come check Matt out at his first Wishing Well / 
GrooveFuel performance.

_Anita_DeCastro_(Scarab Records)_Indianapolis
This young funky breaks master is making her way into what is soon to be a 
great breaks scene here in the Midwest. At the young age of 18, the future 
is looking very bright and from here the sky is the limit.

_Def_Leper_(Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids)
If you have yet to see this crazy lunatic rip your intestines out and sing 
to them, you need to be main stage at when the music starts to hear him. 
Let's just say if you are under 18 hold your ears, haha.
More info to come this week... Wishing Well and GrooveFuel rockin' it.

The closest Paul has come to Ohio has been Chicago. It speaks volumes for 
our scene that he would come to play. If you look at his past gigs you 
will see that Columbus is by far the smallest city in North America that 
Paul has ever played. Thank you for helping me make this possible.

Now with that being said. This event is being promoted throughout the 
entire midwest. Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania & Ohio. I higly 
recommend getting your presale tickets NOW because there is the strong 
possibility of this event selling out. We are talking with both 
Ticketmaster and ticketweb and we will have them online with one of the 
services by the end of this week.
Presales start at only $25.

GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well present
One Love
Northeast, OH - February 22, 2003

The production tandem of GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well trek north with 
some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, New York, Florida, California and many other states 
representing. This is an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio 
and see how much of a great scene we are and what we can produce if we 
cooperate. We have selected many dj's and have gotten full support from 
surrounding crews to bring you the following crowd rockers:

_Dj Rap_(Proper Talent)_L.A.
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live 
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londonís Charissa Saverio, aka DJ 
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes 
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female, 
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of 
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent, 
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via 
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of 
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the 
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and 
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)_L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back 
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and 
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC 
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As 
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the 
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene." To this day, Feelgood remains 
one of the most beloved DJs in the country. From Coast to Coast and from 
week to week he can be seen spinning at landmark clubs such as Twilo, 
Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild popularity overseas. With 
Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak hour house sets only one 
question remains - Can You Feel It?

20KFreaks and GrooveFuel AM present

FIRST NORTHERN OHIO APPEARANCE!
_Jackal's_Digital_Mix_( Hallucination Recordings / GrooveFuel AM )_Miami, 
FL

Icey and Baby Anne have brought his tracks to Ohio countless times but, 
the hour is finally near for Ohio to welcome the true prognosticator of 
Florida breakbeat and mayhem, Jackal. Best known for his involvement in 
the electro-core tandem of Jackal & Hyde, producer/performer Scott Weiser 
is nothing short of a living legend in electronic music. His most recent 
contribution to breakbeat and house heads across the world: Jackal 
Digital Mix Set - an hour of energy and controlled techno mayhem from the 
mind of a master madman. Off the chain would be an understatement. Tie 
your roofs down and hide your kids because Jackal is coming to town.

Scott Weiser (Jackal) needs no introduction, both of his groups Jackal & 
Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables 
from Los Angeles to Berlin. -URB MAGAZINE

_FACTORe_( 20KFreaks / GrooveFuel AM )_Birmingham, AL

The staple of the 20kFreaks label, FACTORe is one of the most talented and 
respected breatbeat DJs and producers in the industry. Behind the decks 
since the early 80s, he's been ripping it since most of you were in 
diapers. When FACTORe throws down his pounding breakbeat, there won't be 
an ass that isn't shakin'. Come experience the past, present, and future 
of breakbeat as FACTORe brings his signature style and class on the CUT N 
DROP Tour. The tour was first named the "All The Tracks We Produced That 
You Thought Were Icey's" Tour, but, turned out that CUT N DROP was a lot 
shorter and fit on the record.

Sat Mar 01                    BACK TO BASICS 3                      SW Ohio

Groove Reactor Records and Buckwyld Entertainment Presents:

BACK TO THE BASICS 3
March 1st, 2003
Southwest, Ohio

It's been over 4.5 years now, and we're still going strong. We've thrown 
massives, club events, intimate events, and we keep coming back for more! 
On this night, we will revive the series that started it all - BACK TO THE 
BASICS! This event is exactly that - a return to the old school. We've 
secured an intimate 1 room venue, an awesome sound system, a killer lineup 
and the kind of old school atmosphere and decorations that got a lot of us 
into the scene long ago. We will be giving away hundreds of copies of 
D8A's newest CD, and we will be powering our evening's visuals with 
another laser to blow you away.

LINEUP:

KNOWLEDGE: Columns of Knowledge, CT - (www.columnsofknowledge.com) Techno, 
House, Tribal House - Continuing in our tradition of bringing out the very 
best of the east coast DJS, it's our pleasure to bring one the biggest 
proponents of dance music in the USA. A DJ since 1995, Knowledge has his 
hands in almost every aspect of the electronic music industry. On top of 
his impressive DJ credentials which includes shows all over the US and 
Canada, he also runs one of the east coasts premiere production 
companies. To date, he has thrown over 75 parties and runs a successful 
club night in CT. Knowledge has produced material released on K:cid and is 
working on another release for 2003. His first fully licensed CD will be 
out in 2003 and he will be giving away plenty of free promos of his latest 
demo - LIVE AT BOO 7. His style is one that fuses together techo, house, 
progressive and tribal. Knowledge continues to be one of the driving 
forces behind the success of the east coast movement and it is our 
pleasure to bring him to Southwest, Ohio. Check out some of his live sets 
on www.columnsofknowledge.com

ADAM WRIGHT: 4-Score, GSP Entertainment, Katatonic Afterhours : 
www.4-score.com / www.gspentertainment.com, Nashville, TN - Back in Ohio 
once again, this mixin' master is ready to throw down like never before. 
Combining all styles of breaks into his set, you will see for yourself why 
he took home first place in the Spin Cycle DJ Battle in Louisville, KY 
last year. His flawless mixing and scratching tactics are sure to leave 
you in awe. Once he is behind the decks you will know the vibe is alive!

BENBEN: Ill Factor/H-Bomb Syndicate/Isotetrix, NASTYVILLE, TN : 
www.vinylbeats.net / www.4-score.com / www.theillfactor.com - Ben is 
coming to you live & direct from Nashvegas bringing you a taste of the 
innovative ole'school intelligent broken beats. A rising name in the 
Southeast dnb scene, Ben has shared the stage with such prestigious acts 
as Ming & Fs, Soulslinger, TC Islam and Dieselboy, to name a few. Ben has 
spent the last year spreading the rinsed out mash'em up koncrete message 
with the Ill Factor along with the Spacemen in and around Florida. His 
Ohio appearance will not be one to miss.

KITSONIK: House, Breakbeat, 2Step, Trance www.unifiedent.com, 
www.wellknowndjs.com,
www.airplaneclique.com - Cincinnati, OH The Kitsonik sound is a moving 
progressive blend of Breaks, House, 2Step and Trance. She is known for 
both her energetic and sassy presence behind the decks and her ability to 
throw down and almost any style of music flawlessly. There is never a dull 
moment when she performs and she likes to keep the crowd on their toes by 
layering different musical genres. This flexibility is also shown through 
her mixed CDs where she has released 2 House/2Step and 2 Trance 
compilations, her latest being Hearthouse II.

D8A: SPECIAL OLD SCHOOL ACID HOUSE SET - www.groovereactor.com, Buckwyld - 
Dayton, OH - Over time, D8A has developed a unique style that always 
pleases. Ranging from the hardest hitting house and on into harder German 
techno/ trance, you can always expect to see the crowd dancing during his 
sets. Tonight though, D8A is preparing a special treat NOT TO BE MISSED. 
He will be dropping an ultra-rare acid house set with some of those 
long-ago heard gems and recent underground acid tracks that will truly 
take you BACK TO THE BASICS. If you were around in the glory days of acid 
house and like the older styles of DJ Pierre or Terry Mullan, this will be 
the set you've been wanting to hear!

NELSON: www.glasscityrecords.com / Black Sun Entertainment - Funky Disco 
House, Toledo, OH - Nelson is one of the biggest supporters and proponents 
of the NW, Ohio scene and he's developed the scene into something special. 
Including the launch of his own Glass City Records, his NW, Ohio message 
board www.glasscityrecords.com and his successful run of club and one-off 
events, it's no wonder the word is quickly spreading. His funky-filtered 
house sounds will surely keep everyone begging for more.

MATT ROBERTS: Unpredictable Entertainment / Glass City Records - Techno - 
Toledo, OH - Matt will be bringing some down the hard techno sounds from 
Toledo and will be drawing on the Detroit influences who have made the 
sound what it is today. Plenty of wicked drum codes and percussion, 
combined with his flawless mixing will surely help to set the tone of the 
party.

CATNAP vs. DEF LEPER: Mecha Studios - Hardcore, Gabber, Who Knows - 
Columbus & Springfield, OH - There is no question that when these two take 
the stage the sparks will fly. Expect to be entertained with audio and 
visual sensations of hardcore, gabber, and noisecore and a little bit of 
everything in between. Plenty of people have asked for another tag team 
between these two see get here early to hear them duke it out!

OOMPA LOOMPA: Trance - Cincinnati, OH - Oompa has made quite a name for 
himself this past year and the demand to see him spin increases every 
weekend. He brought some major bombs down at Bumpin and Jumpin 2 and it's 
our pleasure to bring him in again for some more mayhem!

Subject: {pb-cle} Travis Owens @ Abbasso this Sat

Travis Owens will finally be back at Abbasso this
Saturday from 11pm-5am. Jay Shaumberg (one of
Abbasso's resident DJ's) will be opening from
9pm-11pm).

For those who don't know Travis, he is an incredibly
talented tribal house dj who encorporates deep house,
prog, and some tech house into his sets.  Travis held
down a weekly residency at Abbasso for much of last
year, so anyone who remembers coming out on a Saturday
and hearing great house at Abbasso probably remembers
Travis.  Unfortunately since he recently moved from
Colombus to Dayton we don't get to hear him much any
more, so this Saturday will be a treat for the Abbasso
crew.  This night is a must-hear for anyone interested
in forward-thinking house music.

Free before 1am, $10 thereafter, 21+

If you're not going to 'Electronic Sensation' (have
fun if you are...good lineup for a cleveland party) or
want something a little more relaxed come check it
out.

-Jamie Tyler

i don't know if it was posted here, but the whole PEMF thing was 
supposedly a joke by someone.  i emailed the aol account and it does not 
exist, so i'm assuming it was a disposable account.   

i did read some talk of a real PEMF a year or so ago, one backed by the 
city, but haven't heard a peep since.

THIS EVENT IS NOT, NOR EVER WAS HAPPENING.

Some kid thought he would be funny and make up a fake production company
and fake party. No DJ on the lineup was booked, nor ever contacted. It is
100% fake... so everyone can stop arguing how it should be, or who should
be playing... it isn't real.

some people have too much free time.

well, i plan on rolling over there as soon as im done at work,
which should land me at the spot around 11:30-12. as far as
anything else goes, i dont really care. ill tag with mike for a
while, i might let jwan come mix with me in the middle of my set
for a while if he wants, i have no preference. ill be bringing
mostly techno and broken beat stuff, but alot of house too, so the
least preferred would be the alternating hours, it would just get
too "house - techno - house - techno" or something.

Subject: {pb-cle} Moonstarr live @ the Warhol Museum Tomorrow (Friday) night

no one has mentioned this on here, but it should be ill. world
famous broken beat maestro Moonstarr is rocking the burgh tomorrow
night, along with local heavyweights ed umm and the technoir audio
boys. shit's going to be white hot, i better see mad heads repping. 

from http://www.pittsburghpulp.com/content/2003/01_16/arts_live.shtml

MOONSTARR
ANDY WARHOL MUSEUM
Friday, January 17

Somewhere in Toronto lies a stretch of asphalt called Dupont
Street. Bustling with car traffic, the old neighborhood seems like
an unlikely inspiration for a musical artist. However, Toronto's
public transit system has a subway station on Dupont, and its
futuristic, modern art design truly stands out. Toronto resident
Moonstarr, otherwise known as Kevin Moon, admires the station and
the surrounding multicultural neighborhood so much that he named
his most recent album Dupont. The six tracks boldly defy being
stuffed into one genre, skipping between shades of hip-hop, U.K.
garage, dancehall, techno and jazz. "Interplanetary Thoughts in
Flight" begins with a smattering of synthesizers that sounds like
a space battle between dancehall DJs. It gradually evolves to a
chaotic, yet crisp broken beat techno, combined with gentler, more
soothing synthesizers. "Workin' Man's Hustle" adds a dash of disco
to make a decidedly sexy electronic experience. "Greed" revisits
some of the dancehall sounds from earlier in the disc, with its
stripped calypso beats and jazzy guitar. Finally, "Movin' On"
centers itself around a calm saxophone sample and spreads out to
include Moon's drum beats. After Dupont was released on Public
Transit Recordings, the label that Moon started with some fellow
musicians, the prestigious Compost Records, offered to release
remixes of "Workin' Man's Hustle" and "Greed." Working on the
remixes allowed Moon the invaluable opportunity to breathe the
same musical air as Compost's 4Hero, Ian Pooley and Jazzanova. The
artists have had a strong influence on Moonstarr, as can be seen
and heard tonight when he plays live at the Warhol. Don't miss the
chance to hear his unique style of music.

You can just play the last two hours then ... Brother Mike will open the 
first two hours with some bumpin house.  Jwan is more than welcome to come 
in and play too.

Looking forward to it tonight.

woohoo...you guys are gonna be back again!  I had a blast the last time you both were out.  (hmmm...me, the girl dancing all night) 
Seriously, these two were AWESOME, the last time I heard them.  Mixing pretty darn good, VERY interesting selections.....just a great vibe.    
I'd really recommend to anyone that if you can make a point to come hear them.

Hey list.
Just thought I would drop a line and say hey.  It's been a LONG 
time since i've been on this list.  Just recently moved back to 
Columbus from San Francisco.  Thought I would see what was going 
on.

nice one. my gf and i have been buying the flying circus on dvd,
plus we have the holy grail, life of brian, and time bandits on dvd. 

at the old pbs raves, we used to play great films while the
deejays were playing. at life is but a dream we played 2001,
logan's run, and a buttload of other scifi films. at the burial,
we had predator, jungle book, blade runner, etc. that shit always
helps a set out, imo. something so simple should always be
implimented whenever possible.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} last night @ havana.....

I was only able to be there from 12-1, and was mostly staying quiet (as I
tend to do), but what I heard was a damn nice set, especially whatever it
was you were playing around 12:35-12:40 that got some of the floor moving.

My first time there. Have to say honestly that the small size will take
some getting used to, but otherwise it was comfortable. Also, since you
were talking about movies, was it your idea to have City of Lost Children
playing in the background? That's wacky, yo. :-)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} last night @ havana.....

Tom thanks again for playing ... I really enjoyed your set and it's always 
fullfilling to hear that a DJ had a great time playing at Havana.  You know 
you made my night ... I told you ... when I heard the first few notes of 
that one song and I said to myself, 'Oh shit, he's playing Chaka Kahn!' ... 
That was it!

Anyway ... we didn't have the DVD player hooked up but we were playing the 
French Film, 'City of the Lost Children' on video during your set. (in case 
you didn't notice)

Probably see you tonight at the Warhol.

Jasonc

Next week I think I'm leaning towards playing the movie 'Barbarella' during 
Colin Pierce's set.

... and of course we always play the Type-O crew's visuals at some point in 
the night.

We'll see.

>that is such a bad movie.

oh it's horrible movie ...
of course the sound won't be on so I think the bad sci fi visual effects and 
a young jane fonda running around in those slinky 'futuristic' get-ups will

It's the song is called "Destiny", by Zero 7.

 

IMHO, it's by far the #1 babymaker of last year.(it was released in
2001, but got popular in 2002)

 

Zero 7's site is at:

http://www.zero7.co.uk/

 

also, check out the video if you can.VERY nice.

 

Thanks!

Really?  I thought someone would have to have seen that movie in order =
for it to get popular.

On a related note (songs getting released, and getting popular a year =
later due to some non-song exposure), I saw a clip from the new Dave =
Chapelle show.  He's driving a Mitsubishi Eclipse, with some chick doing =
a parody of the bitch dancing in the Days Gone By commercial.   He's =
like "what the hell are you doing", and pulls over, opens the door, and =
kicks her the fuck out.

I think he's lurking on pb-cle.

  Really?  I thought someone would have to have seen that movie in order =
for it to get popular.

  On a related note (songs getting released, and getting popular a year =
later due to some non-song exposure), I saw a clip from the new Dave =
Chapelle show.  He's driving a Mitsubishi Eclipse, with some chick doing =
a parody of the bitch dancing in the Days Gone By commercial.   He's =
like "what the hell are you doing", and pulls over, opens the door, and =
kicks her the fuck out.

  I think he's lurking on pb-cle.

Subject: {pb-cle} electronic sensation

what a great party, tons of people, everybody came out for this one. 
great music, especially the live PA DnB early in the night with the live 
drummer. the trance DJ in the cowboy hat downstairs was good. I loved 
the lighting in the main room, very professional. polywog wasn't very 
good, but I was expecting that. for $4 a shot, the bar could have 
stocked better tequila too. anyway, thanks all you dayton kids for 
coming up north for once.

Both Deviant and Darbe's mixes are up, recorded live from Friday 1/17's ::TRUE:: party. The event was a tribute to the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In the first 25+ minutes of Deviant's set, he mixed in the full "I Have a Dream" speech (on-the-fly). The rest is pretty kickin', too. Thanks to everyone who came out and voiced their support. Dream on, dreamers.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} electronic sensation

yeah, this was a good party.   so it takes dayton and cinci kids to fill 
up a cleveland party?  nice!

voight kampff is fucking awesome.   they had a drummer playing and the 
one guy played a bass geeter.
3 apple notebooks.  damn.
paradox was pretty dull, didn't live up to the hype.
wasn't digging too much what i heard down on the 2nd floor, but some was 
okay stuff.  didn't pay alot of attention to the dj's down there, mostly 
socializing.

saw some old listies, ray g, todd hednist, met some i've never met 
before, marisa & nick.  few others wandering here and there.

anyhow, heres the pix:

yeah i know i wasnt there but i just dont believe you. simply from 
watching videos of him playing, i cant imagine it wasnt the bomb. 
of course, i guess paradox flies over most peoples' heads 
entirely, but i thought you of all people would feel it traat.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} electronic sensation

I had a very good time spinning at this.  The sound in the third area 
could've been better, but I feel that my set went really well anyway.

I was very dissappointed with Atomic Babies.  Their Live P.A. was very basic 
and pretty boring, but some of their stuff was good.

Best sets of the night IMHO, go to Vicious Vic and Andy Hughes.  Andy only 
got to spin for 45 minutes, and also was the last one to go on.  I think 
that he should've went on earlier.

I didn't check out Polywog, but someone said that she was shoving people out 
of her way walking through the crowd and also that she fried the system that 
she played on.

I would've enjoyed the D&B acts better if it wasn't for the MC.  He was very 
annoying.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} electronic sensation

dude paradox wasnt on his a game...and it wasnt cuz of his beats or
bass...his beats and bass were really good(typical reinforced style)...i
give paradox mad props on the beats and bass ...reinforced bass is the
shiznizm...what put me off about his set was...he would jam some banging
shit...like same beat and bass...different backround sounds...then he would
drop all that out to a 140bpm breakbeat...whenever he did that...it just
killed the room...everyone kinda looked around like...what the hell is this
guy doing...experimentation is a good thing...it really is...but when you
got punters inside that payed 30bux a head...and alot of them made a 6hour
drive...they dont wanna hear that...they wanna hear him rinse it out...all
that being said...i would gladly listen to paradox do a bad set with no
timing then the best progressive, trace, house, or uk garage dj in the world
getting all the records to hit the "g" spot.

voight kampf was off the hook...i like the way they do things...they ran a
dnb mix in digital performer on a master lappy...they had 2 other apple
lappys running reason as slaves...they jammed on reason to the mix with midi
keyboards...they also had some effects processors they would play with...the
drummer played along with hats, snare, floor tom, and kick...the drums didnt
really get over the system...but from where i was at the back of the stage
the drummer kept good time...

ak1200 laid down the banging dancefloor stuff...the stage smelled like a
cross between cat piss and a skunk by the time he was done playing...i
wonder who couldve been responsible for that ;)  :i: am responsible for the
first and only rewind BOH!

good party...even though the bar was raping everyone...4 bux for imports?!
this isnt the flats....4bux for a shot should be a good size shot too...not
a tiny ass disposible shot glass that wasnt even as big as my single glasses
at home...hell...i pay 3bux for johnnie walker blue and soda at most
bars...but at the eagles nest...4 bux gets you a jack and coke with barely
any jack in it...something needs to be done about this...the nest had to
make money last nite...there is no reason to be raping people on mixed
drinks when you have at least a 1000 punters inside(probably more)...you
made most of your money on water and the rental of the hall...they made a
pretty good penny at the bar too ...i know the last time i left the bar the
bottle of jack was done, the bottle of crown was done, and the bottle of
bacardi was well on its way...they grossed 112 bux on each of those
bottles...they probably only pay 12 bux a piece for those bottles....that is
really outrageous....i know they pay less than a buck a bottle on
beer....next time im bringing the 3 wise men in with me... jack, ron, and
johnnie :)

anyways bigup to whoever threw this...and to everyone who likes to dis
dnb...all i gotta say is dnb rocked the main room til 3am...all you need is
a decent sound system and good performers...

bigup andrew for hooking me up with 30 bux for the turntable i brought
out...next time you guys are up this way drop me a line...i can hook it with
a killer system...   the eagle will come down!

what ever happened to the reinforced banner behind the stage...i looked at
the stage from the bar it was there....i looked back 20seconds later it was
gone...hmmm...i think a certain drunken junglette may be responsible

Overall, I must say that I had a jolly good time.  I was curious on how this party would turn out since most events I have been to in Lorain have been mediocre at best.  Yet, somehow this one kept me there well into the night and almost till close which I haven't done in over a year.  There were some downsides, however, like paradox, downstairs, and the bar.  I have never heard of paradox to be honest, and I was not impressed at all.  When I go to parties I expect to dance, and the only way I was going to get my groove on during this set would be to have a seizure.  It was too sporadic, and just not pleasant to my ears.  The downstairs...,eh, it was good to socialize in, but as far a tunes go, blah.  I would say the only one that somewhat got me going was Infinite Grey (at least I think that is who it was), but everyone just cleared the room when he came on.  I guess people can't appreciate a switch from dnb to deep house.  The bar upstairs was an absolute joke.  No selection, way overpriced.  I just hope no one was really planning to get their drink on, it was a waste of time.  One pleasant surprise was voight kampff, once again no one I have ever heard of but a nice change, just all around excellent music (and the three apples, oh yeah!).  Last, but not least, what really made this party special was all of the great people I got to meet and spend time with.  Some on the list, some not, but some of the best company I have met in a while.  Nice to see everyone at the net meet, so many names that I won't bother to list, but a special thanks to trout, tricia, and adam.  It was fun, and hopefully this is the trend of the scene to come.

I was very dissappointed with Atomic Babies. Their Live P.A. was very basic 
and pretty boring, but some of their stuff was good.

Best sets of the night IMHO, go to Vicious Vic and Andy Hughes. Andy only 
got to spin for 45 minutes, and also was the last one to go on. I think 
that he should've went on earlier.

I didn't check out Polywog, but someone said that she was shoving people out 
of her way walking through the crowd and also that she fried the system that 
she played on.

I would've enjoyed the D&B acts better if it wasn't for the MC. He was very 
annoying.

see man, this is a serious problem with junglists. JUNGLE IS NOT
LIFE. if youre a fan of paradox, you realise that his output on
breakbeat and broken beat labels at this point is much higher than
his output of jungle singles. even 3 years ago, about half of his
reinforced releases had breakbeat tracks on them, including a good
portion of the "musician as outsider" LP. i guess thats his point
he was making in the title though, drum and bass heads cant feel a
true musician making music, not some lifestyle music that theyre
into. but oh well. i love that guy's production more than 99.9% of
any other electronic musicians. his style varies so much over many
different tempos, but you can always tell his tracks because of
those nutty breaks he uses. the fact that he swears by akai
samplers for his old school sounding drum beats is one of the
reasons i got myself an akai sampler. i really wish i could have
made it out for this......

when someone is billed as live DNB they should play live dnb...you know how
you were pissed off that reid speed decided to play dnb instead of garage?
same deal, alot of people drove, 4, 5, 6, some cases 8hours plus to hear
paradox do a live DNB pa...dont those people...who have invested probably 50
bucks into this party experience(gas, door, overpriced drinks)get what they
expected and nothing less? as for his breakbeat stuff...he was just putting
on the breakbeat so he could get his next set of samples lined up....he
wasnt doing anything other than playing a drum loop(he had everything muted
except for the drum loop)...and i know this cuz i was 5 feet behind him for
about half of set watching how he did things on the atari,akai, and
mackie...now this along with bad timing...was really killing the room...you
know how a dj can get the beats lined up...but its not in time? same type of
deal...

eh, i chalk it up to being an educated consumer. if no name rave
promoter puts next to paradox's name "live drum and bass", im
going to assume that i know better than the dipshit promoter who
has probably never heard paradox before in his life considering
his less than stellar popularity especially on this side of the
ocean. you have something of a point, but i think the fact that a
drum and bass crowd frowns on anything not STRICTLY drum and bass
is more to blame for their dissappointment. i always appreciate
people mixing it up.

shit man, you ever tried to deejay a paradox record? good luck
with it. basically, you either go for that semi-trainwreck sound,
or you do a non-mix. ive seen videos of him playing live, i always

knows anything about the guy, theyd know what to expect from him.

hey, if you didnt know it on all his LP's he puts tracks of
nothing but his drums that are free for people to sample and do as
they wish with. i dont get down like that, but ive always loved
when people do that kind of populist type shit with their music
instead of being all elitist about it. so you could drop a couple
dollars and get those fabulous breaks all for yourself, tomorrow
if youd like to.

i wasnt saying you in particular, but the fact that you said that
his switching BPMs killed the dancefloor makes me irritated. he's
one of the tightest illest drum and bass producers out there, and
heads cant keep up, despite drum and bass's reputation for
"progression". it makes me mad.

dude i dunno, wishing well is the only crew bringing out big name dnb to a
mainstream raves in ohio....most ohio parties have a room full of no name
dnb....and a huge techno/house/progressive/breaks headliner...everyone of
their parties has what most people would consider an a list headliner...this
one had two(paradox and ak, say what you will about dave, he has been
rocking our side of the pond for what 11-12 years now?)...so these guys do
know their shit...personally i wouldve put something like "experimental,
progressive drum and bass pa" on the flyer...but maybe thats too much
reading for the average raver...

ive played a few paradox tunes...ive pulled off mixes...you just gotta
choose your spot wiseley...you cant try to mix the drums all the
time...sometimes you have to get the ambients(pads, keys, sound effects,
whatever)to mix with the other tunes ambients...it really is all about where
you try to place it in the set...personally though...i cant mix paradox
stuff with anything that isnt off of reinforced...his shit will mix well
with most of sonic and slivers reinforced tunes as well as breakage's...i
dont really like mixing 3 tunes from the same label in a row though...so i
dont normally play his stuff.

i didnt know that he did that...all the paradox stuff i have is bootleg mp3
that i burned and mix on the cd-players...thanks for the heads up though...i
got another thing to look for...lord knows nobody in cleveland would have
his lps in stock...but im sure chemical or red-eye has them in back

bro i was just stating facts...when he switched tempo...people were confused
by it...and it killed the dancefloor...at a rave people are there to
dance....when something very abrupt like switching styles out of time and
off beat happens...people stop dancing cuz it ruins the whole internal
rhtyhm they had going to the music...nah mean? i think if he wouldve done a
clean transistion to breakbeat on a break down or something the crowd
wouldve gone mad...it can be done too...my old roomate can go from house to

blasloski(sp?)...to junior sanchez...to freq nasty...to ming and fs...to
origin unknown...clean as hell...in time...its all in the selection and
programming of the mix i guess...

it could be, but i think that catering to the lowest possible
common denominator (in this case, jungle heads in general) when
someone like paradox steps way outside that boundary on pretty
much every record he makes is bad promoting if it draws a crowd
that isnt knowledgeable of what to expect from paradox.

that my point though, basically there's no simple way for him to
transition without stopping the totally insane beats somehow,
either by dropping to a slower beat or by dropping to ambience,
either of which isnt going to really ignite the hardcore dancing
drum and bass massive. 

>i didnt know that he did that...all the paradox stuff i have is
bootleg mp3

he had one LP as Alaska that i was looking for a couple years ago,
i cant even remember the title now, but i never found that at all.
he's had a couple reinforced LPs though, and theyre pretty simple
to find, shouldnt be too difficult, especially since the heads
dont just run straight to the reinforced section of record shops
to buy all the paradox tunes. also, you could even check online
for an MP3 cause i think the drum breaks are also included on the
CD versions. 

>bro i was just stating facts...when he switched tempo...people

>rhtyhm they had going to the music...nah mean? 

yeah thats just too bad though. i mean, dance music should be able
to get a little crazy without worrying about people not digging
it. 2 hours of the same beat at the same tempo is crazy boring,
but thats what people want. they want a deejay to mix 40
indiscernable beats smoothly instead of playing 40 ill beats and
having to make them sound not-so-flawless when presenting them. i
think that attitude is weak. 

>i think if he wouldve done a

might i just point out that this is physically impossible without
using records that step up incrimentally in BPM and then as you
move between them pitching the newest record in from way low to
way up before mixing in the next step. and while that may be
entertaining for some people, i find it annoying since it means
you are pretty much limiting yourself to what you can play in a
given stretch of mixing, you have ot be too conscious of BPMs. i
think if people wanna switch up tempos, they should just do it
pretty clean cut, maybe scratch the beat in a bit and then just
let it rip full speed and cut the other track. the "seamlessness"
of dance music kinda ruins it a bit for me. get crazy. get funky.
fuck shit up, try something interesting on the fly.

i believe the album that you are talking about might be Alaska - Virtual=20
Virtuosos on Vibez records. i got this album sometime ago and haven't=20
listened to it for awhile but when you said Alaska i pulled it out. i hav=
e no=20
way of knowing if this is the lp you are talking about or not. but track =
1 is=20
called paradoxial and after i listened to it i would say that this is=20
possibly paradox. not only do the beats sound very similar but also the w=
ay=20
he changes them up through out the tracks is similar to the sstyle he=20
demonstrated at electronic sensation.

Subject: {pb-cle} voight kampff  WAS Re: {pb-cle} electronic sensation

this how voight kampff did their shit...they tracked a mix in digital
performer...it was a regular dj mix...alot of the stuff was probably orginal
from them...but there were some released tunes in there as well(chili pepper
by moving fusion was in there)...ok now this computer running digital
performer was the master...the other 2 laptops were running reason
2.0...these 2 laptops were slaved to the master running d.p...im guessing
they had a clock running in d.p....they were using the synths in reason...to
jam basslines and new sounds over the mix that was running in d.p.  they
also had outboard fx, an outbord compressor...and a d.i. line for the
bass...all of the audio was routed to the system via a 4 channel mixer...im
guessing one channel was the master laptop, 2 and 3 were the slaves, and 4
was the di for the bass...the drummer...he wasnt heard by anyone that wasnt
on stage...his drums werent mic'd up...but he seemed pretty proficient...he
wasnt using a very big kit though, just a jazz kit...

thats the one. you feel like ripping it to MP3 for me and putting
somewhere i can grab it? paradox is ill, his stuff as alaska is
generally more ambient/abstract sounding than the paradox stuff.
how did you happen upon that LP? i couldnt find anywhere that
stocked it...........

no, im just saying that i think people are a little closed minded,
they only wanna hear straight 180 BPM (in the case of jungle) or
straight 145 BPM (in the case of house techno or trance) smooth
mixed electronic dance tunes. i think thats horribly limiting the
scope of dance music. alot of dope shit is made without drum
machines, so you have to ride a live beat over a drum machine beat
of another record to mix them. this is basically impossible to do
without constant slips and corrections of the live drummed record.
ive seen so few people attempt a mix like that that its silly.
perfection is nothing. smooth mixing is nothing. good music is
everything. thats all. 

while we're on this subject, how was Titonton at this rave? he's
one of my heros now because he will just do things, and theyre not
smooth, or perfect or anything like that, but he keeps it
interesting and plays great records. no one commented on his set.
what did he play, jungle or techno/broken beats?

First off, 

 all the bad comments about the other party in
cleveland this weekend makes the fuzz studios/x-scape
crew feel better about their flawless event on sat
night! we had a packed house of 175 people with a
tight vibe, eclectic J and Ben Kenobi tore down the
house to a wild crowd! Shag-E played through the power
outage and the police invasion. Thanks to all the
DJ's, Crew and Extended family!

We would like to thank all those who supported us and
extend our condolences to those who said we could not
pull it off over bigger headliners on the same
night.....respect to the sensation crew, we hope u
made your mark, for us it is back into the corners to
plan the next one!

Hope to see you ALL @ the next one!

Bad comments? I thought the good comments outnumbered the bad ones. Why
would you be happy to see another promoter do poorly? Flawless event? I
wouldn't call a power outage and a police invasion flawless.

I agree, Polywog was a real disappointment this time, not to mention kinda rude but...I had a pretty good time, nice to see a crowd with so many different areas represented. Kinda sorry I missed the netmeet an all. Nice meeting you Tricia!

Hey there hi there ho there
I never write back to this post thing..hardly ever anyways...
Jayson here a.k.a.- DJ Yajah
In response to Meghan Wilson: you must've had a great time ... your set was
great and the demo you gave me is off the hook..like I told you at the
tables..my friend April and I came out to see you and that because we knew
you were going to be there we knew that at least an hour or more of the
party would be exactly as we would love it to be. I think I have played the
demo to myself 10 times already..it has not left my cod player except maybe
once to let it cool off. The party was exceptionally good. I agree with you
that the sound in the third room could've been a little better...but despite
the disappointments everyone wants to talk about...and there were some for
everyone, I think that most of what I have read so far has been just
opinions.. no real bad disappointments, at least none that weren't due to
peoples own expectations.. my one and only serious disappointment...was that
an icon of our beloved scene..dj polywog was either seriously messed up or
needed to be or something... what was with that? she mixed Bach and shinad
o'conner..then ac/dc?????? what the frickin' hell was going on there...was
she seeking publicity? was she really pushing people? was it all a big frick
off to Cleveland? was she in a midlife crisis? what was that? I went over to
meet her right before she went on..which was about 5 minutes after she
showed up...late.. at like 4am or so I think.. anyways..she gave me a big
hug..I told her how much she was loved here in Ohio..and introduced her to
my friend April whom she greeted warmly.. and she thanked Cleveland and the
kids for loving her when she came on..then.. then....... who knows.. I have
no idea what the hell that was... I can't even rightly call it a set.. talk
about trainwrecks..this was turntable terrorism... I mean it sounded better
that morning for me on the toilet than it did from her on those beautiful
decks...the very name of "dj" should be striped right out from under her..
all the copies out there of the movie groove should be taken back..recalled
just so they can redo them without polywog in them..she disappointed me
hardcore..big time..to the point I was near tears for her...worried about
her. can anyone explain this? I am hurt...confused...did she just do too
many drugs? what happened?disappointed by my own expectations and wanting
clarity. Jay

Voight Kampff made my night. Thought Paradox was awful. Missed the net meet
due to last call and they made making us keep the drinks upstairs. Got to
meet Jea Leigh though who was very friendly.

thats the one. you feel like ripping it to MP3 for me and putting
somewhere i can grab it? paradox is ill, his stuff as alaska is
generally more ambient/abstract sounding than the paradox stuff.
how did you happen upon that LP? i couldnt find anywhere that

Thats just how she is, she really and truly sucks as a DJ, the only reason she gets booked is because of Groove.  When she played in Dayton last year, she was pretty fucked up(not sure on what though), so it wouldn't surprise me if she was again in Cleveland.  Promoters need to stop wasting their money on her, when I'm sure they can pay their 8 year old little brothers 10 bux to play with the same level of talent she does.

Subject: {pb-cle} Retraction of Statement

obviously people think we are down on the other
promoters or are trying to flame someone, BUT we
helped promote for them, even though we had a
cleveland date scheduled back in november of 2002. We
hope they did well and i was only trying to say that
all the crap we took wasnt neeeded b/c of the
smallness...we still had a great turnout with a great
vibe ALL of our DJ's were 100% that night

Sorry for the confusion of wording....we love gift and
global productions....no hatred to them, especially
since they apologized for promoting over us! we look
forward to wroking with them someday........just
becuase we didnt have big dj's and we used a small
venue doesnt mean we dont get a chance to hold
strong......everyone starts small...maybe next time we
can consolidate nights and have a massive.

once again, no drama,. no hatred....
evolve crew moves on,....the revolution WAS the problem

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} electronic sensation

Overall, I really enjoyed this party. It had a good vibe and lotsa 
party kids from around the state and even met a few from outside Ohio. 
Me and my friend (her first party btw) wandered  around all the rooms 
but spent the majority of the time upstairs/mainstage. The DnB act 
before AK were ok, nice to see real intrumentists keeping up with a 160 
bpm tempo, and yah, WOW about having 3 macs. Anyways, Ak threw down 
some good stuff and everyone was bumping, and not too bad for having 
seen him for the 1st time in person. J Smooth, the special guest also 
played some good chunes, but towards the end of his set he really lost 
me. As for Paradox, I though he was really tight, but it was just to 
fucking unpredictable to dance to (the snares threw me off a quite a 
few times). After the DnB massacre in the main room, I was hyped to see 
Atomic Babies and was hearing good things about them, but when they 
came on... Really synthy almost trance like techno that got to pretty 
repetitive fast, and i noticed they dropped alotta the same samples 
throughout their set. Tight, but def not for me (or many others i 
think); it was missing way to much percussion for me and had a housey 
135 BPM the WHOLE time. I almost fell asleep twice and was hoping theyd 
get done sooner than they did. Dont mean to dis them soo much, they 
were good to LISTEN to, just poorly scheduled on the lineup.  Andy 
Hughes dropped some kewl shit and I got active fast, trying to make up 
for the Atomic Babies set, but I wouldnt say he was fantastic, I just 
need a good jolt of prog house.
Later,
Alex tweak

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Open house thanks......

I didn't hear anyone say that Open House would do badly, but there was some
skepticism which I heard primarly from people who were hoping that Open
House would do good in the first place.  You are comming accross as if you
are throwing your success in in people's faces - sending out condolences to
people is a little bit weird.   There was a day and time where we could have
two successful parties in one night (Element Squad & The Future Consortium
is a prefect example)  -- and we haven't seen it in a long time!  The
success of Open House AND Electronic Sensation gives hope that there is
indeed still a scene in Cleveland (which people DO say there is not).

The willingness you guys showed working with Drew and his cutting the cover
for people attending Open House shows something we have rarely wittnessed in
our local scene. RIGHT ON... .this is how it should be!  I've been thinking
for some time that with a little group effort we could all blow this town up
and make it something to be proud of.   I feel strongly that the only way to
"break the loop" we have been stuck in is to get the people behinds the
scenes organized as more of a community... and that is starting to happen.

I would have been out for Open House, but it was impossible -- and I didn't
want to drive out to the nest @ 3am when I was done working because I was
driving to Columbus to see Halo and Behrouz.  BTW.... Behrouz was a really
good dj.. I had no clue.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle}  electronic sensation Lights Visuals Voight Kampf

What the hell was going in the bar? I saw some cheap mobile dj lights, 
if i remember correctly, but nothing was turned on or anything? The 
nack room on 2nd floor i remmeber looked nice with the 4 scanners and 
complete darkness... i chilled in there for a lil. But mainstage had a 
decent hookup: the 6 over head scanners and 2 behind the speakers... 
gave for some nice effects. Im assuming they were High End or Martin? 
If u guys were in charge of video screens, how come the big one at the 
back and top of the room was taken down and another was placed 
underneath? To me it would have looked better there if it was adjusted 
right. Also i think if someone decided to put some lights up their 
(some scanner of some kind) and link it with the ones up front, it 
would have had a TIGHT full room look to the lighting...all u need is 
extension XLR cables? But good job for most part! Better than seeing 
American dj lights set up like the ones i own, thats not why i pay 25 
dollars for.

Subject: {pb-cle} Wanna Job in Pgh?

Sorry for the cross post, but this might help some people out.

I talked to one of the developers that Heinz lost to DelMonte in their 
recent split, and he needs someone for a Cold Fusion contract that will run 
three months or longer. Anyone in the Pittsburgh area want to get in touch 
with this guy? He needs people to call him like ASAFP I guess.

Hit me up if you need to know anything.

think the lights looked good.  the visuals were too out of the way, 
seemed one of the projectors had alot of stuck/hot pixels and really 
didn't give them alot of a look because they were in the back up kinda high.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} voight kampff  


See, I think that's a cool idea, and something I've been toying with quite a bit lately.

People in this day and age just aren't going to get into totally 100% original material like a live
PA. If you can introduce some familiarity into it, but mix it up in a way that's new and fresh, it
makes the experience that much better.

This is not a weak attempt at BSP, but my latest mix, "Build Your Own" comes from that thinking.
It's 100% compiled from edits, chops, loops and mixes I've done of other works by established
artists.

Yes, I mixed it live (albeit on the computer and without all that auto-BPM correction crap) , but
the songs are my own edits, or I'd create a 3 minute loop of a decent section of a song and toss it
in with another track.

Or, for a good example, at the tail end, you'll hear about 10 minutes of Kraftwerk. I chopped up and
pasted together the first three tracks from Electric Cafe ("Boing Boom Tschak", "Techno Pop" and
"Musique Non Stop"), cranked the BPM up to 130 to fit in, and mixed it in.

The only thing I'm missing right now is the outboard gear to truly fuxk with stuff.

I would've been interested to see and hear what Voight Kampff was laying down. I'm-a have to look
for some MP3's...any suggestions on what to look for??

this how voight kampff did their shit...they tracked a mix in digital
performer...it was a regular dj mix...alot of the stuff was probably orginal
from them...but there were some released tunes in there as well(chili pepper
by moving fusion was in there)...ok now this computer running digital
performer was the master...the other 2 laptops were running reason
2.0...these 2 laptops were slaved to the master running d.p...im guessing
they had a clock running in d.p....they were using the synths in reason...to
jam basslines and new sounds over the mix that was running in d.p.  they
also had outboard fx, an outbord compressor...and a d.i. line for the
bass...all of the audio was routed to the system via a 4 channel mixer...im
guessing one channel was the master laptop, 2 and 3 were the slaves, and 4
was the di for the bass...the drummer...he wasnt heard by anyone that wasnt
on stage...his drums werent mic'd up...but he seemed pretty proficient...he
wasnt using a very big kit though, just a jazz kit...

yeah we only did lighiting for the main room. i guess hardman did 2nd or 3rd 
room. yes we had 6 trackspots and 2 technobeams, high end. i had both of our 
10 foot screens set up in the begining. the ownwer came to me an said he was 
gonna have people up there drinking beer and what not so there was no way in 
hell i was gonna hve drunkards looming around our projector, so even though 
i really wanted to leave both 10 footers up i opted to take one down and fly 
to 6 foot screen from the balcony using a projector below. yes i would of 
loved to have had the screens on stage as i usually do but with all the live 
PS's space wasnt available. hopefull for One Love i will be able to at least 
put a 6 footer behind the dj.

we had a great time rocking it out and we will be back in feburary

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Open house thanks......

yo i had i good time. i saw alot of people that i haven't seen in awhile. i 
agree with doug. we have a huge scene. but not alot of togetherness. just 
imagine what we could do. if we all stopped  the hating ands egos that some 
people have. this period of time that has went by. has weeded out alot of 
the people that weren't in it for the music. and music is why were here 
right. lets not forget about this. i could care less about money. i do what 
i do. because i like taking people and turntablism to the next level.

viva house music
peace

my opinion of your set:

it was in no way balanced, showed any continuity
had any kind of mixing skill, or good track selection

how you got to be a popular DJ is beyond my understanding

your set reminded me of a jukebox at the local pool
hall.

there were no trainwrecks because there was no mixing.

are there any mixes of yours online that show off
your DJ'ing talent?

I can understand you were on TV with famous bands,
and that that corporate black hole
that passes for musical television featured you
but they also featured jenny mccarthy for a while

anyway i'd love to hear a set of yours that proves
me wrong, until then you're just another pop culture
clown with too much tatoos and bleached hair, that's
doing a disservice to the rave scene

"most" Newbie djs suck ass. I'd rather hear people listeing to the good djs like back in the day instead of everyone wanting to be a dj. Oh i'm in a movie now, i'm so cool blablabla. ;]

my opinion is this: most deejays that are women suck. i dont want 
to guess as to why, but its the truth. there are a bunch of really 
slick female deejays that i like alot though, so im not all 
misogynist. that said, im sure she sucks. anyone agreeing to be in 
gay ass movies about raving certainly have to be questioned (and 
the one person i talk to online that i respect who was in it, i 
gave shit to him about it after i saw it). anyway, i do think she 
has valid points about what music should be played, and the way 
music should be mixed. im not saying what she played was good, 
cause i wasnt there and if you forced me to guess, id say she 
probably sucked. but people in the rave "scene" (what a joke that 
sounds like to me in the year 2003) are way too conditioned to 
want strictly boring sets from deejays.

now im confused here. was the lack of continuity simply because 
she didnt beat mix? im a big fan of concept mixing, which often 
times doesnt even require any mixing at all. selection and flow 
are what counts the most. i watched my boy akil blow up the 
moonstarr afterhours on friday night strictly with non-mixed dope 
tracks. if your only qualm with her continuity was the non mixing, 
youre falling into the preconditioning im talking about. if 
however she was just indiscriminantly playing pop hits, i might 
agree with you. 

>anyway i'd love to hear a set of yours that proves
>me wrong, until then you're just another pop culture
>clown with too much tatoos and bleached hair, that's
>doing a disservice to the rave scene

are you saying she's doing a disservice to a bunch of e'd up 15 
year olds? ha. if you want to point fingers in the rave scene, i 
dont think its right to point the finger at someone who has 
tattoos or piercings or funny hair.

Great. I guess even I could get up there and totally suck at mixing and
just say it was 'concept mixing'. Kinda like taking a dump on the floor
and calling it art?

Subject: Re: Fw: {pb-cle} electronic sensation

Okay wait a minute.. I am either missing something or
the people on this post are drastically not paying
attention. This stuff about female DJs not being
good.. well it isn't making sense. See I believe that
not even a month or so ago there was a whole slew of
posts praising female artistry. Names were mentioned
and people gave shout outs to their most respected of
female DJ's... okay so Polywog was in a movie.. an
independant film about raves at that... i liked it.
and i am not quite sure who some of the others
mentioned in the last bashings were, but where are all
the kids who had so very much to say about all this
not even a month ago. I find this line of commenting
immature and sexist. Female nor male should matter
right? The music should...so polywog spun a eclectic
set that no one was expecting..doesn't mean she sucks
just means a bunch of expectant kids didn't get the
sound they came for.. its like going to mcdonalds and
ordering a big mac and they give you a bucket of
original KFC. Most people are going to say it sucks
but if you stop and put your expectations to the side
you realize that the latter is better in quality and
value then the former. Okay so i personally think
polywogs set was more like putting a quarter in the
gumball machine and getting Reeses peices..it didn't
make sense to me at the time but after realizing i
hadn't informed myself on what to expect except to see
some b flick performer well...hey i think i like the
reeses. i wish i had taken the time to study up on
poly before..looked at her website and listen to her
sets on there (www.djpolywog.org ). now that i have
heard her side of things...i feel ashamed at my
ignorance. There are so many great females in the
scene and out of the scene. One of my favorites is on
this post.. DJ Meghan! Is anyone really listening to
themselves when they write to this list..am i?

were you even there or do you think that invailed
opinions on subjects you aren't part of is just "a fun
thing to do"? what right do you have to bash a set you
didn't hear? and if in the rare event you could afford
to go and hear it..did you really listen?

yeah, he was there, i was too, it made my ears hurt.  only reason i 
stuck around is because a bunch of my friends were sitting there 
chatting it up.  i wasn't paying attention to the actual mixes, but a 
few tracks made me cringe.  badly.  

and taking a crap on the floor and smearing it on yourself and the crowd 
has been deemed performance art, GG allin proved that!!

In the rare event that he could "afford" to go? Like as in, having
the money to go? Or the energy? That doesn't even make sense.

This isn't my argument, but I still want to interject. Ellis was responding 
to Tom's comments, and I think Ellis' point was well worded based on what 
Tom said.

I'm not siding with either one of them, but think its important to take 
Ellis point with respect to Tom's description of 'concept mixing.'

I don't think his opinions are *invailed*

were you even there or do you think that invailed
opinions on subjects you aren't part of is just "a fun
thing to do"? what right do you have to bash a set you
didn't hear? and if in the rare event you could afford
to go and hear it..did you really listen?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} scene death?  what scene?

"The Scene" is still here somewhere, it just isn't the one you're expecting.
Most of the new innovation and "good stuff" is underground, where it should
be.  Most have turned away from the current "scene" that is being promoted
for obvious reasons such glamorization and stereotyping by big media who
Just Don't Get It.

New music, new ideas and new relationships are still bring cultivated, just
on a much smaller scale and much more private.  House parties, small
gatherings, etc. are where it's at.  Granted it may not be what it used to,
but it's still there to some degree.  Some people, I think, are still
waiting for the Next Big Thing.  Some people *are* working on the next big
thing.  Maybe some of us (myself included) are too out of touch to know
where this thing are going or are too scared to help direct it to where we
think it should be.

Ugh.  I'll cut out the rhetoric now and shut the hell up.  Shoulda kept my
mouth shut in the first place.

Is a national phenomenon! >>>

There is a LOT of stuff to be said here, but I'll try to be brief.   This
phenomenon is not new, it just happens every time the country moves into a
conservative era.  I also am guessing that cities who had a unified and
tight scene are the ones who are thriving -- as well as cities who are now
just getting a scene.  (Dayton, OH - perfect example -- It was remote enough
to miss the first wave of "the scene" and now they are catching the tale end
of it).

I think this "downtime" we are experiencing was caused by several instances
of cause and effect.   As "the scene" became commercialized, more and more
"social campaginers" and "status seekers" took on the role of promoter.
This new breed of promoter/dj did everything they could to clear out anyone
who held power, on their way to the top. I'm not saying this was
intentional, but that's what tends to happen when people who are on a "star
search" or on their way to "fame and fortune" get into an underground
business.

So with so many uneducated promoters throwing events, there came a plethera
of bad music.   The longer you are in "the scene" the more your musical
tastes change.  This *IS* a progressive scene.  If you are having new people
throw events, it stands to reason they are going to book talent that
represents their immature taste.  This is why you have had events with "hard
house" or "anthem trance" playing at 9pm to an empty room.  Anyone with more
developed taste is not gonna enjoy this -- but all the kiddies who heard
about raves and are at their first one are gonna love it.

So this type of promoter pushed those with experience out of the way to
cater to the "newbies".  And once they did their damage, they dissapeared
never to offer anything else constructive.

Now along comes "Emenim" who says "Nobody listens to techno".  This put a
HALT to new people coming into the scene.  Suburban kids (you know what I am
talking about) stopped coming out to techno events and all of the sudden
there is no one new to promote to -- and all the true heads have been scared
off by the shit that was being served.

In order to move forward and progress, a successful promter need to find
ways to entertain "the heads" as well as bring new people in.  They have to
learn to provide QUALITY and DIVERSITY as well as serve the typical shit
that some want to hear -- in hopes that those people will progress and stay
in the scene longer than 6 months.


<<<What is killing the scene?:
High price greedy djs/artists/record stores? Drugs? riaa?  influx of a
million djs?  p l u r killed?  clear channel?  club owners?  sucky
producers?>>>>

Stupid people, the commercialization of it, drug ABUSE, and "the rockstar
syndrom".


<<<<<(the fcc raised the act requiring strict ownership for radio back in 96
and now they are trying to do the same with the media, including news.  BAD
IDEA!!!!)
Is it bc people have turned this into a business now?
no music innovation?  economy?>>>>

economy has a lot to do with it.   part of me thinks a lyrical form of
underground music (similar to goth/80's synth) is gonna provide the thing
people need to identify with music.  when people are depressed, i think they
need something beside just the music -- they need som relevant lyrical
value.   Oh, and I think it has always been a "Business" -- those who think
otherwise were just naive in thinking that..


<<<<<Seriously!  What can we do to stop this before it is too late?  Some of
us live for this, but it seems that anyone that has been in the "scene" for

seen a mass turnover in my time and it seems that as the years go by the
turnover becomes faster and more robust.
the only people who stay in the scene are the previous mentioned peoples,
and even they have begun to realize that it seems success if futile.>>>>

Push for unity.  People need to go out and support -- but there needs to be
quality to support.   Education of what is quality would help immensly.
Letting people know that this scene offers something for them no matter what
they are into.


<<<<<In any case, if we do not stop this stuff below, this will be the final
nail in the coffin.
i dont know about u but the govt has become too insane if you ask me.

govt.>>>>

This shit ain't new -- England went through the same thing years ago.
Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't see much of a difference.   We'll just
all have a more intimate underground to be a part of.  I agree we gotta do
what we gotta do to keep the government in check, but let's not spend time
worrying about it and instead of complaining, bitching, and bandwagoning why
not OFFER SUGGESTIONS as to how they can accomplish their goal without
affecting our rights.  Its time to move forward instead of sitting still.

Subject: {pb-cle} RE: [nyc-raves] scene death?  what scene?

something new?

top 40?  rap?  remix galore?  that is not a good direction i want to go?

the older people arent in the scene anymore, from where i can see and sit?
unless they are a direct part of it, and even that is slim...

if we just "see where it goes", it will be to the grave, cause that is the =
direction is has been going for 3 years.

what's over now?

Let it die & go in another direction.  I went out last night the place was
jammed packed..........  Its not dead it is just going in a different
direction...  the older people from the scene are going to nicer places to
party with maturity.   I just go with the flow ..........  See where it
goes.  Im tired of living in the past.  Its over & now its time something
new  :)

Subject:	[nyc-raves] scene death?  what scene?

I have a serious question for everyone!

Is it me or is the "Scene" not only slower, but dieing a horrible =
agonizing
and slow death?  I read everywhere how numbers are down, people arent =
coming
out, everyone and there mom wants to hear rap or top 40 crap rather than
house, etc.
Is a national phenomenon! =20

What is killing the scene?:
High price greedy djs/artists/record stores? Drugs? riaa?  influx of a
million djs?  p l u r killed?  clear channel?  club owners?  sucky
producers?

(the fcc raised the act requiring strict ownership for radio back in 96 =
and
now they are trying to do the same with the media, including news.  BAD
IDEA!!!!)
Is it bc people have turned this into a business now?
no music innovation?  economy?

Seriously!  What can we do to stop this before it is too late?  Some of us
live for this, but it seems that anyone that has been in the "scene" for
more than a year now is either a dj/promoter/artists or leaves it.  i have
seen a mass turnover in my time and it seems that as the years go by the
turnover becomes faster and more robust.
the only people who stay in the scene are the previous mentioned peoples,
and even they have begun to realize that it seems success if futile.

In any case, if we do not stop this stuff below, this will be the final =
nail
in the coffin.
i dont know about u but the govt has become too insane if you ask me.
it is time to give the people back their power, rather than giving it to
govt.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to how, why or what can be done to at =
least
stop (or reverse) the trend that seems to be going on, especially since
2000?
I have my own ideas, but am up for suggestions!

Last year you helped the Drug Policy Alliance stop the RAVE Act from=20
becoming law. This year supporters of the draconian drug war bill are=20
back with a vengeance.  They have stopped calling it the "RAVE Act"=20
and have stuck its provisions in a popular omnibus domestic security=20
bill. This is a common Congressional ploy: put controversial bills=20
that can't go anywhere on their own into important bills, so that=20
Members of Congress are forced to vote for them.=20

Your help is needed to stop these disguised RAVE Act provisions from=20

The bill, S.22, is sponsored by Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD). The=20

Tell them:
    1) You oppose the "crack house statute" amendments in S.22.
    2) These provisions are just like the provisions in the RAVE Act=20
       last year.
    3) The provisions would endanger public health, free speech, and
       property rights.=20
    4) Urge them to contact Daschle's office and work to get these
       provisions removed from S.22.=20

it all depends. any moron can take 20 trance records and beatmix
them in the proper place (when the melody stops). mixing
conceptually is much harder, generall requires a pretty huge
knowledge of music across many many many genres, and requires
having tracks to satisfy both the average listener and the most
critical trainspotter. so basically if you have those qualities,
sure you could go blow up a party without beatmixing a damn thing.

sure it is. ive seen a good number of female deejays over the
years, and all but maybe 4 were atrocious. alot of times females
get booked just because theyre female and the guys like to see that.

when was this? i dont remember it, i would have certainly

wow, thats way too bad. the sarcastic high fives exchanged at my
house when dickweed showed up to save the day was the highlight of
that crap movie for me. 

>I find this line of commenting

>right? The music should...

thats right. that is all that matters to me. and female
disproportionately suck at playing good music. i dont think its
sexist at all for me to observe this, because its simply an
observation. im not saying female deejays suck because they arent
males. im just saying that mostly they suck.

thats cool. in case you didnt notice, i was not critical of the
fact that she didnt play dance music. i defended that, with the
condition being that i was defending the IDEA of her set, not the
actual set itself, and thats because most female deejays ive seen
suck, so i would assume she sucked as well. 

>There are so many great females in the
>scene and out of the scene.

if you say so. there's some, but considering the fact that women
make up over 50% of this country and probably less that 5% of the
entire dance music scene, i wouldnt say that there are "so many".
who knows what the reason is for this? its probably some bit of
men holding women back to a degree, alongside some inferiority
complex women have about underground music scenes which are so
predominantly male.

>THIS is why you prove youre an ass.

how are they not shallow forms of music? they are the cheesiest
end of dance, they all suffer from predicitability, and theres not
room to grow within the music. any of the more quality styles of
electronic dance music have different places to go within the
genres, and are generally more timeless. its pretty simple. 

>Yeah tha sun does revolve around tha earth.

everything revolves around me.

if we just "see where it goes", it will be to the grave, cause that is the direction is has been going for 3 years.

Subject: [nyc-raves] scene death? what scene?

I have a serious question for everyone!

Is it me or is the "Scene" not only slower, but dieing a horrible agonizing
and slow death? I read everywhere how numbers are down, people arent coming
out, everyone and there mom wants to hear rap or top 40 crap rather than
house, etc.
Is a national phenomenon! 

What is killing the scene?:
High price greedy djs/artists/record stores? Drugs? riaa? influx of a
million djs? p l u r killed? clear channel? club owners? sucky
producers?

(the fcc raised the act requiring strict ownership for radio back in 96 and
now they are trying to do the same with the media, including news. BAD
IDEA!!!!)
Is it bc people have turned this into a business now?
no music innovation? economy?

Seriously! What can we do to stop this before it is too late? Some of us
live for this, but it seems that anyone that has been in the "scene" for
more than a year now is either a dj/promoter/artists or leaves it. i have
seen a mass turnover in my time and it seems that as the years go by the
turnover becomes faster and more robust.
the only people who stay in the scene are the previous mentioned peoples,
and even they have begun to realize that it seems success if futile.

In any case, if we do not stop this stuff below, this will be the final nail
in the coffin.
i dont know about u but the govt has become too insane if you ask me.
it is time to give the people back their power, rather than giving it to
govt.

Does anyone have a suggestion as to how, why or what can be done to at least
stop (or reverse) the trend that seems to be going on, especially since
2000?
I have my own ideas, but am up for suggestions!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------
Last year you helped the Drug Policy Alliance stop the RAVE Act from 
becoming law. This year supporters of the draconian drug war bill are 
back with a vengeance. They have stopped calling it the "RAVE Act" 
and have stuck its provisions in a popular omnibus domestic security 
bill. This is a common Congressional ploy: put controversial bills 
that can't go anywhere on their own into important bills, so that 
Members of Congress are forced to vote for them. 

Your help is needed to stop these disguised RAVE Act provisions from 
becoming law!!!

The bill, S.22, is sponsored by Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD). The 
troubling drug war provisions are in the section entitled "Crack 
House Statute Amendments"

ACTIONS TO TAKE

*** Call your two Senators. You can contact your Senators through the 
Capitol Switchboard at 202-224-3121. To find out who your Senators 
are go to: http://www.senate.gov/senators/senator_by_state.cfm. 
Tell them:
1) You oppose the "crack house statute" amendments in S.22.
2) These provisions are just like the provisions in the RAVE Act 
last year.
3) The provisions would endanger public health, free speech, and
property rights. 
4) Urge them to contact Daschle's office and work to get these
provisions removed from S.22. 

** Fax Senator Daschle (even if he is not one of your two Senators).
To fax Senator Daschle go to: 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=1448.

** Please forward this action alert to your friends and family. The 
Senate needs to know that voters find this bill unacceptable.

For more information on the RAVE Act and how the S. 22 "crack house" 
provisions will affect public health, free speech, and property 
rights see: http://www.nomoredrugwar.org/music/rave_act.htm 


Please visit 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.ctsg.com/managesubscription.asp to

individual lists. 

For problems, please contact Jeanette Irwin at jirwin@drugpolicy.org .

Please consider joining the Drug Policy Alliance:

You can access the new bill at:
http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:S.22: 
(NOTE: you must cut and paste the entire URL, including the colon, 
into a browser to access this document.) 

The bill can also be accessed by searching from
http://thomas.loc.gov/home/c108query.html . The Thomas homepage is
inexplicably on last year's session, which is why you probably couldn't find
this bill initially.

Maybe people have more important things to worry about now rather than
supporting the rave scene.
People are growing up, getting educated and looking to find a good job.
Its not the 90's anymore man.

I'm not saying I don't enjoy some of it some of the time, but all said, it's about the most

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} scene death?  what scene?

I think doug pretty much covered most of the bases
with this issue, but I feel the self-righteous need
retouch two of his points that are particularly
relevant, at least to the Cleveland scene:

Quality and particularly diversity seem to be two
things that Cleveland has been loosing over the past
few years, at least in my pseudo-educated opinion, and
it's resulted in at least the partial dissolution of
what may have been a cohesive scene several years ago.
 Promoters seem to focus only on the style of music
that they like the best and/or are the most
comfortable with to the detriment of their events as a
whole.  This tends to result in events with one type
of crowd, which does nothing to expose people to music
that they would not have otherwise experienced. 
Promoters (be it party crews or club promoters) would
do well to make a conscious effort to mix up the music
more and attempt to attract a broader crowd.  In the
long run this should only serve to advance the scene
and hopefully push some people to expand their musical
horizons.

Unity is a huge thing.  The various cliques that make
up the underground scene in Cleveland seem to have
very  little interest in the people or music that
constitute the other groups, and that reflects poorly
on the scene as a whole.  If the downward spiral (to
be exceedingly trite) is to be reversed, I think there
needs to be a lot more interaction and mutual support
between these various groups as they attempt to
advance the scene.  I am admittedly as elitist as
anyone else (except perhaps Mr. Cox) when it comes to
my preferred genres, but I also see that sticking with
one or even a couple genres and refusing to expose
myself to any others is merely cheating myself.  

So to sum up the previous paragraphs of semi-cohesive
rambling, both promoters and those who go out to enjoy
the music they provide would do well to broaden their
horizons and embrace as much of the spectrum of
electronic music as they can as opposed to focusing in
on a few frequencies...and keep in mind that the U and
R are at least as important as the P and L.

This is an interesting theory you have doug. My personal opinion is that techno(and to some degree trance) was the music of choice and when it was forced out by bandwagon esque people, i.e. (rebels, hardhouse listeners, jungle people, cheese trance promoters, etc., etc etc) and the newbie promoters came in not knowing the game(around 93 and through to 98) you had very very bad music by unknown morons who couldn't spin a lick to save their lives. Harder Techno pretty much died, the bandwagon filled up with knobs and hardhouse was pushed as the hard scene. That's where the problem began imo. The people who were around have their own littles scenes but the problem lies in the mainstream. The hard and loud  techno scene isn't the mainstream anymore and i'm not quite sure how it ever was in the first place. Only by a luck and a small culture imo. Now everyone wants to be a dj and spin the latest trance cheese and yo yo yo be a tough(laugh) junglist who does hiphop remixes(no offense junglists, i've got old xl recs). 
Believe it or not There's some better hard trance coming out the last few years again.  Reminds me of 92-.94 but totally newer sounding. Kai traccid, marc dawn, organ donors, gouryella, etc. There's some really underground brutal stuff out there. 
 Then again you have some more new wave techno type artists coming out. The horrorist comes to mind, adam x is on an industrial route,. hypnotizer, etc. etc.
Things have definitly branched out. One things for certain, i'm sick of the norm.

There is a LOT of stuff to be said here, but I'll try to be brief. This
phenomenon is not new, it just happens every time the country moves into a
conservative era. I also am guessing that cities who had a unified and
tight scene are the ones who are thriving -- as well as cities who are now
just getting a scene. (Dayton, OH - perfect example -- It was remote enough
to miss the first wave of "the scene" and now they are catching the tale end
of it).

I think this "downtime" we are experiencing was caused by several instances
of cause and effect. As "the scene" became commercialized, more and more
"social campaginers" and "status seekers" took on the role of promoter.
This new breed of promoter/dj did everything they could to clear out anyone
who held power, on their way to the top. I'm not saying this was
intentional, but that's what tends to happen when people who are on a "star
search" or on their way to "fame and fortune" get into an underground
business.

So with so many uneducated promoters throwing events, there came a plethera
of bad music. The longer you are in "the scene" the more your musical
tastes change. This *IS* a progressive scene. If you are having new people
throw events, it stands to reason they are going to book talent that
represents their immature taste. This is why you have had events with "hard
house" or "anthem trance" playing at 9pm to an empty room. Anyone with more
developed taste is not gonna enjoy this -- but all the kiddies who heard
about raves and are at their first one are gonna love it.

So this type of promoter pushed those with experience out of the way to
cater to the "newbies". And once they did their damage, they dissapeared
never to offer anything else constructive.

Now along comes "Emenim" who says "Nobody listens to techno". This put a
HALT to new people coming into the scene. Suburban kids (you know what I am
talking about) stopped coming out to techno events and all of the sudden
there is no one new to promote to -- and all the true heads have been scared
off by the shit that was being served.

In order to move forward and progress, a successful promter need to find
ways to entertain "the heads" as well as bring new people in. They have to
learn to provide QUALITY and DIVERSITY as well as serve the typical shit
that some want to hear -- in hopes that those people will progress and stay
in the scene longer than 6 months.

economy has a lot to do with it. part of me thinks a lyrical form of
underground music (similar to goth/80's synth) is gonna provide the thing
people need to identify with music. when people are depressed, i think they
need something beside just the music -- they need som relevant lyrical
value. Oh, and I think it has always been a "Business" -- those who think
otherwise were just naive in thinking that..

worrying about it and instead of complaining, bitching, and bandwagoning why
not OFFER SUGGESTIONS as to how they can accomplish their goal without
affecting our rights. Its time to move forward instead of sitting still.

dub is brilliant because of its lack of real definition. its very
much like drum and bass, in that it has a few very strict rules
but outside of that, you can do a zillion different sounding
things and its still dub music. drum and bass is ruled strictly by
a style of drum beat and a big bassline. aside from that, you
could stick jazz, r+b, or experiemntal music over the top and it
would still be drum and bass. true dub is very limited being from
the late 60s to late 70s, and its my favorite of all dub related
musics. however, the mad professor's stuff sounds nothing like
that but it is still dub. and basic channel sounds nothing like
that but it is still dub. dub can be used and manipulated into any
other genre of music and it brings with it that alien futuristic
vibe.

Dude, get your shit straight. First, I was there. Second, I wasn't even

Snore!  Old news.  IMO their music isnt very good.  The had one strong track and even that got boring after hearing it a million times.  Unfortuneatly their silly side show stage act and fashionable apparel has overshadowed the good electro thats being produced right now.

yeah, since thats all 2-step is/was. considering the entire genre
has been around maybe 4 years altogether, and that it now
resembles in no way what it was when it began, and that it
incorporates tunes from people like todd edwards, roy davis jr, as
well as the big guys like mj cole and the artful dodger up to the
newer styles of so solid, i guess ignorantly dismissing something
you know nothing about makes sense. that generalisation isnt even
really all that great considering how the most popular tunes of
the genre were written by classically trained musicians. also, i
guess youre neglecting the fact that covering/remixing/sampling
has been part of the black music continuum for a loooooooooong
loooooooong time now. 

sucker.

Subject: {pb-cle} Really Really Late Top X of 2002 

damn, i thought i had sent this already, but i just found it in my
"drafts" folder. oh well, here goes:

theyre not limited to 10. ive added some comments. these are my
favorite:

Singles:

1. Shawn Rudiman - Rubin's Place EP - Technoir Audio

yeah so im biased cause he's my boy, but this shit is so well
rounded and generally playable in any circumstance around the 130
BPM range. hotness.........

2. Erlend Oye - "Ghost Trains" - Source

this makes me wish metro area had some tracks with straight up
vocals on it. morgan's production here is on some ill italo
disco/new wave kinda shit, and the vocal is so soft and haunting.....

3. Titonton - "Curvaceous" - Amalgam

this track will be classic for me at least, nice minimal
atmospheric techno influenced broken beat bizness.

4. Los Hermanos - "Quetzal" - Los Hermanos 002

stunningly beautiful string laden detroit goodness.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmm............

5. Seiji - "Loose Lips" - Bitasweet

some off the hook ragga/hiphop influenced broken beat shit with
some hot emceeing. possibly the most distinctive riddim of the
year, i trainspotted it from down the block when i rolled up to
Havana the night when Mikebee was spinning there.......

6. Syzmanski - "Lover's Quarrel" - Omoa

absolutely sick slow as hell house tune with sickly sweet soaring
synth melodies. sounds kinda like the blade runner theme made sexy.

7. Todd Sines + Natacha LaBelle - "Come Closer" - Planet E

i dont really pay too much attention to all the click house kinda
stuff that comes out, but this is just above and beyond the rest.
the vocal makes the tune soooooooooo great.

8. Mundo + Jade - "Come to Me" - White Label

a huge warm rolling latin influenced 2-step jam from dallas. the
spoken word bit is inviting, and the guitars are just ill. its all
about the low end though.......

9. Sticky + Tubby T - "Tales of the Hood" - Social Circles

the best dancehall/2-step crossover tune this year, with the
socially conscious lyrics and bad bassline.

10. Mr. Scruff - "Shrimp" - Ninja Tunes

just an ill funky discoy housey i dont know whaty tune that fits
sort of in with metro area if youre on a buttload of acid.

11. Metro Area - "Dance Reaction" - Environ

i was hesitant to put this on here since it was an album cut, but
i liked it enough that i bought the UK single just so i could have
a full sided pressing of it. fucking excellent of course.

12. Cousin Cockroach - "This Ain't Tom & Jerry" - Bitasweet

fucking ripping bassline on a heavy heavy broken beat tune.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Albums:

1. Translussion - L.I.F.E./Shifted Phases - The Cosmic Memoirs Of
The Late Great Rupert J. Rosinthorpe/Drexciya - Grava 4/The Other
People Place -
Lifestyles of the Laptop Cafe

RIP james stinson - a constant inspiration since i discovered
Drexciya years ago. nothing says underground or integrity to me
like these guys. they did things their way on some of the best
labels in existance. drexciya are right up there with sun ra,
miles davis, lee perry, george clinton, the klf,  and james brown
as my absolute heroes.

2. Red Hot Chili Peppers - By the Way - Warner

this is essential rock music, possibly the nicest rock album in
the last 10 years. i predict this will become classic. all kinds
of people name check brian wilson now when talking about their
songwriting, but the chili peppers took any good ideas he ever had
and all his warm melodies and made them 1 million times better and
more interesting. so few bands get better with age, but this is
their best album.

3. Recloose - Cardiology - Planet E

absolutely awesome genre defying jazzy techno house broken beat
debut album from one of my favorite electronic producers. this guy
can do no wrong.

4. Metro Area - Metro Area - Environ

these arent all new tracks, but it doesnt matter. the quality of
these songs makes them still sound fresh, and all 4 new jams are
outstanding.

5. The Streets - Original Pirate Material - Locked On

really, any of these #2-5 could have been #1 easily. aside from
the tribute to Drexciya, these other ones are totally arbitrarily
assigned. this is another classic album, the perfect sound of a
witty white emcee using beats from all different genres to make a
great album straight from the streets of england without trying to
copy US hiphop.

6. Various - Scattered Snares - Twisted Funk

this comp shows exactly the diversity and high quality level set
by the west london cats. from extremely dark brooding breaks by
paradox to sublime detroit techno by nu era to sweet downtempo by
moonstarr, this has it all.

7. Clipse - Lord Willin' - Star Trak

these guys are some serious drug dealers, and they have flows. of
course, they wouldnt be on this list without the neptunes beats,
which are so hot its insane. grindin is probably one of the best
beats in hiphop.

8. Jazzanova - In Between - JCR/Compost

these guys are just brilliant. another crew notorious for the
jazzy broken beats, but they deliver an album full of quality
soulful music.

9. Dj Shadow - The Private Press - MCA

i didnt like this album at first. it has since grown on me, and i
find it almost as amazing as his first album. while it is in no
way as classic, the ability he has for transforming samples into
whole tunes that seem like they wouldnt make sense any other way
is unmatched.

10. Justin Timberlake - Justified

yeah, so he rips off micheal jackson. of course, michael never had
the neptunes and timbaland rocking some of their best beats behind
your tracks. this album is great because it essentially combines
pop, hiphop, and experimental music, and manages to sounds awesome
and appeal to tons of people. thats what great music does, it
defies expectations while still being great music.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Films:

1. Adaptation

this shit is just ridiculously crazy. it deserves so many awards,
but it will get overlooked because its just too damn weird.

2. Solaris

george clooney was awesome, the story line deviated from the book
a bit but still it was exactly what i look for in sci-fi:
something that deals with the emotions of people in relation to
new technology and alien beings, without becoming an action film.
very fucking existential, i love it.

3. Road to Perdition

this flick is awesome, and really all i need to say about it is
that scene with tom hanks rolling on his old mob boss in the rain
is one of the greatest things ive ever seen on a big screen. jude
law also makes one of the fucking wickedest villians.

4. The Royal Tenenbaums

this is another crazy comedy/drama movie, and it was also
overlooked, but its already a classic in my opinion. gene hackman
is the man.

5. Gangs of New York

awesome awesome movie. very reminiscient of "do the right thing"
in alot of ways, but with daniel day lewis as a fucking totally
great villian, the only person to out do jude law in RTP.

6. Bowling for Columbine

this should really be required viewing for anyone in america. he
brings up so many points and ideas that never enter the usual
discussion of violence in our society.

7. 24 Hour Party People

the story of the Factory records boss, this seems like something
that should never make it to film, but it did and it was an
excellent look at everything from punk to new wave to acid house
through the lens of the manchester scene.

8. Scratch

another documentary, but this one is definitely more educational
than entertaining. a serious look at scratching records as an art
form.

9. Minority Report

another quality sci-fi flick, though this one was certainly more
action oriented, it still dealt with lots of good concepts and
emotions.

10. Signs

i know alot of people talked shit on this film, but i love it. i
dont necessarily agree with the conclusion of the film, but it was
still brilliantly executed.

11. 25th Hour

the only reason this is so low is because i dont know if it
actually counts as having been released in 2002. its a damn good
look at a life without being judgemental of it.

tom

yes but the problem was they felt diversity meant hiphop and catering to the mtv crowd. big mistake.
diversity isn't what's needed. what's needed is segregation from the useless sheep and scene. an organization of underground proportions is what is needed.

Quality and particularly diversity seem to be two
things that Cleveland has been loosing over the past
few years, at least in my pseudo-educated opinion, and
it's resulted in at least the partial dissolution of
what may have been a cohesive scene several years ago.
Promoters seem to focus only on the style of music
that they like the best and/or are the most
comfortable with to the detriment of their events as a
whole. This tends to result in events with one type
of crowd, which does nothing to expose people to music
that they would not have otherwise experienced. 
Promoters (be it party crews or club promoters) would
do well to make a conscious effort to mix up the music
more and attempt to attract a broader crowd. In the
long run this should only serve to advance the scene
and hopefully push some people to expand their musical
horizons.

Unity is a huge thing. The various cliques that make
up the underground scene in Cleveland seem to have
very little interest in the people or music that
constitute the other groups, and that reflects poorly
on the scene as a whole. If the downward spiral (to
be exceedingly trite) is to be reversed, I think there
needs to be a lot more interaction and mutual support
between these various groups as they attempt to
advance the scene. I am admittedly as elitist as
anyone else (except perhaps Mr. Cox) when it comes to
my preferred genres, but I also see that sticking with
one or even a couple genres and refusing to expose
myself to any others is merely cheating myself. 

So to sum up the previous paragraphs of semi-cohesive
rambling, both promoters and those who go out to enjoy
the music they provide would do well to broaden their
horizons and embrace as much of the spectrum of
electronic music as they can as opposed to focusing in
on a few frequencies...and keep in mind that the U and
R are at least as important as the P and L.

Indecisive - Jungle

INDEC?SIVE has brought together two very great genre's of jungle, ragga and 
jump up, which are not heard out often. She has a need to stand out a bit 
and not follow the crowd. She believes that every great DJ should play what 
makes them happy and uplifts you, and not worry what the rest of the crowd 
thinks. Even though she has only been spinning for a short while, she has 
definitely got the skill and style to make the crowd go wild. She currently 
has a weekly show on www.jungletrain.net, Back 2 Classicz, on Wednesday 
nights from 8pm to 11pm EST.


T.E.C - Progressive

Siempre Foundation, Vertigo Systems, Foundation Resident
DJ T.E.C. has played sets in Amsterdam, Italy, San Francisco, L.A., Chicago, 
Denver, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and many other major cities. He has had 
residencies in Switzerland, and Baltimore. T.E.C. has expanded the horizons 
of the east coast by being an ambassador of our scene all across Europe and 
America. T.E.C. combines hip-hop sampling with progressive beats to create a 
vibe that is moving people from Geneva to San Francisco.

Hit a nerve, did I?  Ha, Ha!
It's good to see someone feel as passionately about the style of music they 
prefer as the rest of us do, regardless of whether it passes the TCCT (Tom 
Cox Coolness Test).  Maybe you get my point.  Probably not. :(

>also, i
>guess youre neglecting the fact that covering/remixing/sampling
>has been part of the black music continuum for a loooooooooong
>loooooooong time now.

Oh, I forgot, Tom.  You're black on the inside.
Regardless, that does nothing to change the fact that two-step was spawned 
from the deepest, darkest biles of the pit of annoyance.
To be honest,  there are three types of music that irritate me to the last 
bone that i honestly can't bare to listen to them without getting sick to my 
stomach.  country, happy hardcore and two-step.

anyway, this is my last post for quite a while (or possibly ever)
so see ya 'round, (or maybe not, since i can't stand going out in pittsburgh 
for the exact reason that you're missing in all of this)

Anyway, GO RAIDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Peace to all,

Darren

yooooooooooooooo back it up here.

anyone remember kimyon's parties?  laurent garnet LIVE, rob hood, cari
lekebusch??  his big fooking warehouse raves with one light and a mountain
of speakers banging nothing but techno and house?

dayton was on point around 8 years ago when kimyon was throwing his justice
parties.  now dayton parties are just conceptually devoid gritter-fests.  no
offence to you dayton peeps, c-bus isn't exactly a happening spot for raves
anymore.  we're forced to admire yours.

just for the record, i've been on one hyperreal mailing list or another for
about 6 years now.  every year somebody 'warns' us all that the scene is
dying and a long thread follows.

just something to think about.

it's been a part of the white music continuum as well. there's been thoudsands of remixes back in the 80s. africa bambata stole a kraftwerk song, what's your point?
anyone remember depeche mode's-big muff?  any blacks busting 4 4 techno kicks back then? lol

yeah, since thats all 2-step is/was. considering the entire genre
has been around maybe 4 years altogether, and that it now
resembles in no way what it was when it began, and that it
incorporates tunes from people like todd edwards, roy davis jr, as
well as the big guys like mj cole and the artful dodger up to the
newer styles of so solid, i guess ignorantly dismissing something
you know nothing about makes sense. that generalisation isnt even
really all that great considering how the most popular tunes of
the genre were written by classically trained musicians. also, i
guess youre neglecting the fact that covering/remixing/sampling
has been part of the black music continuum for a loooooooooong
loooooooong time now.

as much as i hate to do it...i have to agree with tom...if you think dub is 
a predictable and lacking orginality, you obviously dont listen to it...you 
can get dub tunes that sound like jamician ska from the late 50s...all the 
way up to the hottest dancehall riddums coming out of the yard 
today...furthermore if it werent for dub...we wouldnt have hiphop(bambatta 
and kool herc learned their style of dj'ing from jamician selektas)...we 
probably wouldnt have acid house or jungle/dnb or 2step/uk garage/speed 
garage as we know it either...cuz most of the early producers of these 
styles grew up on a steady diet of dub reggae...oh yeah....and those giant 
soundsystems we all love at raves...we wouldnt have those either...cuz rave 
soundsystems are direct decendents of reggae systems(more subs than 2way 
speakers)...and lastly there'd be no such thing as dub-plates(you didnt just 
think it was a catchy name did you?)

something for the dub haters to think about

>it's been a part of the white music continuum as well. 

yeah thats true, but as 2-step is a black form of music, i was
pointing out that it is just continuing to do something that has
been going on in its direct predecessors for X amount of years. 

>there's been thoudsands of remixes back in the 80s.

remixing is a dub thing, ace. keep that in mind. black people all
the way.

>africa bambata stole a kraftwerk song, what's your point?

white people have been sampled to death in black music. so have
black people. and latino people. and now we're seeing lots of
asian and indian people getting sampled. its all part of the black
music continuum. 

>anyone remember depeche mode's-big muff?  any blacks busting 4 4

um, DISCO. also, sly and the family stone were kicking drum
machines as long ago as kraftwerk were.

in jamaica the emcee is called the deejay alot and the deejay is called the

moved to london...they took their slang with them...many emcees in the uk 
are second generation jamicans...so they usually refer to the dj as the

youre still not catching on. i wont go off on my objectivity of
music rant again, because it obviously doesnt sink in. 2-step is
part of a heritage of music. prog house is part of a rip off of
that heritage. if you cant handle one being more true than the
other, youre just shortsighted.

what is your point? that you cant tell something that has a rich
history from something that has whitened that same history to make
it more palatable for a white suburban audience? good point, and
its pretty obvious. 

>Oh, I forgot, Tom.  You're black on the inside.

why does my love of good music and the recognition that most of it
is directly descended from black music elicit these kinds of
stupid fucking remarks?

good call. i can name you many good tracks in both of those other

movement. your prog house shit can never stand up to it.

music is not colorblind though. good music should be, but too
often white people get too much credit when they shouldnt. 

>2step/ukg is just as much a white thing as a black thing...its

this is true, in the UK their urban culture is very diverse, its
pretty enviable really. but that doesnt change the fact that
2-step is the spawn of dub, house, jungle, and r+b, all of which
were created by black musicians.

ok i thought you were talking about something else for a minute.


>remixing is a dub thing, ace. keep that in mind. black people all
the way.


uh no remixing was a remixing thing  as to sell more records for record labels. "oh my god i need that remix dude" "ya but the other remix has the original lp version bro" etc etc. that kinda shit.  btw i'll pull some old records and we can see who remixed first if you're game. lemme know ;]

>white people have been sampled to death in black music. so have
black people.

 

by whites? more so later on really. blacks mainly stole white euro beats.

 

>and latino people. and now we're seeing lots of asian and indian people getting sampled. its all part of the black music continuum. 

 

hahaha funny shit. goofy theory for sure.

>um, DISCO. also, sly and the family stone were kicking drum
machines as long ago as kraftwerk were. 


ya saturday night fever, rent it. lots of white djs. in fact it was mainly italian djs that started disco. i know old school disco djs. i'm not talkin 79 disco larry leavan or knuckles either.

one important thing to note was kraftwerk were building their own instruments and far more electronic than(laugh) sly and the family stone.  

it's all rooted in euros. they always lead. just like in science and creation. i'm proud to be a euro american. thank you very much. ;]

ciao

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Flaming Lips Rave Related

After 'transmissions from the satellite heart' (the album with she don't
use jelly on it and their sixth major realase) they came out with an
album called zarieeka.  Zarieeka was kind of odd in that the album came
on 4 cds meant to be played simultaneously in four different cd players.
Never did find three people willing to sit there and manually change
songs throughout the album so...but their next cd 'the soft bulletin'
was a real departure from their earlier work.  More complex, more
orchestral, just more huge and grand overall.  Yoshimi follows in the
footsteps of 'the soft bulletin' keeping the tight production and
complexities throughout the album. Definitely more experimental than
'the soft bulletin' its also a bit more funky and electronic.  All their
stuff is worth checking out, a good departure from what other "rock"
groups are doing these days.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} scene death? what scene?



As much as I truly wanted to let all this go and my last post to be truly my 
last, I can't let such off the mark responses go unchallanged.
you truly have no clue what I'm talking about.

>youre still not catching on. i wont go off on my objectivity of
>music rant again, because it obviously doesnt sink in. 2-step is
>part of a heritage of music. prog house is part of a rip off of
>that heritage. if you cant handle one being more true than the
>other, youre just shortsighted.

I could care less what music is more true than the other.  I am a nightclub 
DJ.  I get paid for what I do, and therefore, I am a professional.  The 
promoter or nightclub owner pays me to make people dance and to set the 
atmosphere.  If the music is hot (not meaning hot in popularity) I will play 
it.  I don't know why you keep focusing on prog house like that is all I 
play.  I've gone over this numerous times here, and you will hear just about 
anything in my sets, (save DnB, hardcore or 2-step).  But if you really want 
to get down to heritage,
their would be no 2-step without prog house, or house, or techno, or breaks 
or any of the other things you would hear in my set, because despite the 
fact 2-step ofetn uses R&B as a base, it is a form of EDM, and all of these 
other types of EDM came first.  But to me, that i snot important.  I want 
people to dance and to maybe hear something they haven't heard before.  I'm 
not concerned with whether or not the music I'm playing is true to the 
heritage or not.  Maybe you feel that makes me not as genuine as you.  I 
just feel it makes me not as pretentious as you. which is a pretty good 
segue for thext one...

>what is your point? that you cant tell something that has a rich
>history from something that has whitened that same history to make
>it more palatable for a white suburban audience? good point, and
>its pretty obvious.

No, my point is about passion for what you like and what you're doing.
regardless of whether or not i like someone's music, i can repsect the fact 
that they are passionate about it. without passion, there is no greatness.  
and when there are enough people passionate enough about enough different 
genres, that's what makes a good scene, not who or what is realer, more 
geneuine, cooler, more intellectual, or truer to the heritage.  I don't have 
to listen to it, but i respect people with a true passion for something.  i 
may not have and inch of liking for 2-step and you will NEVER here it in one 
my sets, car or home, but i respect the fact that it's there and people are 
passionate about it.
I suggest you learn to do the same.

>why does my love of good music and the recognition that most of it
>is directly descended from black music elicit these kinds of
>stupid fucking remarks?

Because it's really not important.  to me, music is music is music.  and 
while i can give credit where credit's due, whether music is black, yellow, 
red, white, tan or brown, (in the words of shock-g), it really doesn't 
matter, we can all get down.  the majority of the people here (the Djs or 
producers anyway) are fully aware of all the roots of this music, we just 
don't care enough, (or aren't pretentious enough) to have to constantly 
remind people that we know about them.

>good call. i can name you many good tracks in both of those other
>genres as well. both of those are also part of a bigger musical
>movement. your prog house shit can never stand up to it.

please see the above on repsect for a response to this.
and there you go with the prog-house stuff again.  it is not MY pro-house, 
and that is not what i play. and even if it was MY prog-house, i could care 
less if "stands up" to any of those others.  and who really does? (besides 
you, of course).  When you do hear me play it, that is not why.  I play it 
because there's a specific atmosphere or emotion
that i wish to convey with that.  I am not here to champion one sort of 
genre over another, like you are.  i'm saying that there is a time and place 
for everything and the constant complaining coming from you about anything 
people listen to other than what you like can all be said about your 
favorite types as well.  and if you don't understand that,
than you are blinded by your own pretention, seeping from yor brain
and covering your eyes.

>and whats that reason? because you dont understand music? good
>reason.

no, because of pretentious bullshit just like this running rampant through 
just about everything that goes on.


> >Anyway, GO RAIDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>
>oh please.

oh, i'm sorry.  i forgot.  having an interest in the SuperBowl doesn't pass 
the TCCT either.  i didn't mean to interrupt or insult you by expressing my 
liking for something.  next time, i'll check with you first to see if it's 
okay that i like something that you don't.  that way, we'll never have 
another difference of opinion.  and just think, if everyone would just do 
that, we could all live happily ever after in one big, boring, pretentious 
land, filled with nothing but the endless clanging cheese of 2-step.  ahh.  
it's heaven, ain't it?

Peace out,
Darren

	Correct me if I'm wrong, but did u just say that all those groups are

Corsten (and formerly dj Tiesto) who is one of the cheesiest of the 
Trance producers?
	I agree sorta with some of your comments. Lets not forget to mention 
that electronica has become a sort of embarasment in this country with 
the likes of Moby...not that he really WAS alll that horrible, just 
that eminem ripped him a new one and he also began doing mainstream 
garbage music not worth even being considered mainstream. Ask anyone 
and theyll tell you they think raves play Crystal Method and Moby or 
imagining that they loop darude sandstorm and play it all night long at 
raves. Not to mention most people I know have this disgust if you tell 
them you go to raves because theyve been so badmouthed and overly 
criticized by the media (because of drugs).
	I see 2 possible directions for this scene: keep it underground, and 
shady, and perhaps see it die out as people mature and forget and move 
on, OR bring it mainstream and throw better parties, with less shade, 
and more acceptable for people. I'm not saying bring in Moby for a 
party or Paul Oakdog, but sure as hell try an cater to peoples' wants. 
The only way europe is thriving is through mass acceptance of the 
culture, and the fact that people can enjoy the music.
	SADLY, that hasnt worked in our country because people here dont enjoy 
the MUSIC! People here are used to hearing Top 40 hits that they can 
sing along to, rap songs they can rap with, and make them feel hard. 
Even most of the big trance songs that make it big have words in them . 
We are too much of a sit on our ass and listen to music country. Europe 
has more of a get up and do it vibe about it, and they arent ashamed to 
be a dance culture, and hence the rave has thrive for the past decade, 
where instead ours just remain the same. More factors go in to this, of 
course, and the government is to blame, but if things dont change, i 
see it being much worse.
	I dont want to see people combining rock or rap with electronics, but 
if it helps, why the fuck not? Does anyone have a better idea up their 
sleave? Yah, go ahead up against that money making american idol 
industry that is dishing out what they think we should listen to. 
Personally, I don't like being spoon fed.
later,

ok fine, disregarding my previous message, YES this is the other 
possiblity... but i dont see it working!? UNLESS... and i use this word 
again, UNLESS, we bring people into our scene? How  do you keep 
something alive if their is no one left to carry it on? And if we dont 
go along with everyone else, than we need to bring more people along 
for our ride, because it  is more fun!

And we were all born from Adam and Eve so we are all related and are 
inbreeding and I'm your dad, etc. etc.

First of all - why does everything have to stem from the pin-point tip of a 
pyramid?

Who deserves credit for a remixed track? The original producer or the 
remixer? Oh, but its *THIS GUY* because only *THIS PERSON* on the face of 
father time 40 years ago decided to take someone else's music and remix it 
to his own style, calling it *THIS*. He therefore has full personal rights 
for the rest of his glory to any track that will ever be remixed, and 
anything else that sounds remotely like it is watered down poser fodder. 
Except those of *THIS GUY'S* race. Or if they are from *THIS GUY'S 
HOMETOWN*.

"Well, your favorite song just happens to be part of a trickle-down genre 
that is part of whitey excrement, not part of a bigger movement,  therefore 
all of your feelings and experiences are false because you are just too 
ignorant to realize true good music. You stupid fucking white american twat. 
I have no respect for you or your false feelings."

I think thats a load of biased elitist snobby bullshit.

God forbid someone try to take their own spin on things, roll with their own 
experiences and feelings, and create something a little bit different out of 
it.

You don't think you are being more true to music as an art by respecting a 
listener's emotions, regardless of what it is?

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} scene death? what scene?

I think we have to begin with acceptance...

Its really not that hard to just be nice to everybody indiscriminantly.

Wholesome underground scene turns into selfish underground scene.

"They don't fit my social image" or "They don't enjoy GOOD music" or "they 
aren't good enough for me because of any random reason I can think of that 
has nothing to do with who they are" or any other type of arrogant bullshit 
line is just really counterproductive to anything and everything we have 
been involved in as a scene goes thus far.

The bottom line to any of these threads, to me, seems to be pretty much 
this:

Times are changing. We don't know what to do with it. Some of us are scared, 
some of us are angry, and a lot of us really don't give a fuck about 
anything but themselves.

Is it really too much to just go... in with the good, out with the bad... 
and be cool?

Control is not a good thing when it comes to nature...

What a horrible night to have a curse.

my comment on gouryella was meant to reffer to one song they did a remix for which was actually quite hard as far as trance goes. yes i enjoyed that song, it was quite good. i could go into some real brutal music like c-tank but you probably would have no clue as to who they are and since you're being anal, you're using an mtv buzzword called electroni"A". people aware of the bigger picture just say electronic. 
thank you for learning.

I agree sorta with some of your comments. Lets not forget to mention 
that electronica has become a sort of embarasment in this country with 
the likes of Moby...not that he really WAS alll that horrible, just 
that eminem ripped him a new one and he also began doing mainstream 
garbage music not worth even being considered mainstream. Ask anyone 
and theyll tell you they think raves play Crystal Method and Moby or 
imagining that they loop darude sandstorm and play it all night long at 
raves. Not to mention most people I know have this disgust if you tell 
them you go to raves because theyve been so badmouthed and overly 
criticized by the media (because of drugs).
I see 2 possible directions for this scene: keep it underground, and 
shady, and perhaps see it die out as people mature and forget and move 
on, OR bring it mainstream and throw better parties, with less shade, 
and more acceptable for people. I'm not saying bring in Moby for a 
party or Paul Oakdog, but sure as hell try an cater to peoples' wants. 
The only way europe is thriving is through mass acceptance of the 
culture, and the fact that people can enjoy the music.
SADLY, that hasnt worked in our country because people here dont enjoy 
the MUSIC! People here are used to hearing Top 40 hits that they can 
sing along to, rap songs they can rap with, and make them feel hard. 
Even most of the big trance songs that make it big have words in them . 
We are too much of a sit on our ass and listen to music country. Europe 
has more of a get up and do it vibe about it, and they arent ashamed to 
be a dance culture, and hence the rave has thrive for the past decade, 
where instead ours just remain the same. More factors go in to this, of 
course, and the government is to blame, but if things dont change, i 
see it being much worse.
I dont want to see people combining rock or rap with electronics, but 
if it helps, why the fuck not? Does anyone have a better idea up their 
sleave? Yah, go ahead up against that money making american idol 
industry that is dishing out what they think we should listen to. 
Personally, I don't like being spoon fed.
later,

my comment on gouryella was meant to reffer to one song they did a remix for which was actually quite hard as far as trance goes. yes i enjoyed that song, it was quite good. i could go into some real brutal music like c-tank but you probably would have no clue as to who they are and since you're being anal, you're using an mtv buzzword called electronic"A". people aware of the bigger picture just say electronic. 
thank you for learning.

I agree sorta with some of your comments. Lets not forget to mention 
that electronica has become a sort of embarasment in this country with 
the likes of Moby...not that he really WAS alll that horrible, just 
that eminem ripped him a new one and he also began doing mainstream 
garbage music not worth even being considered mainstream. Ask anyone 
and theyll tell you they think raves play Crystal Method and Moby or 
imagining that they loop darude sandstorm and play it all night long at 
raves. Not to mention most people I know have this disgust if you tell 
them you go to raves because theyve been so badmouthed and overly 
criticized by the media (because of drugs).
I see 2 possible directions for this scene: keep it underground, and 
shady, and perhaps see it die out as people mature and forget and move 
on, OR bring it mainstream and throw better parties, with less shade, 
and more acceptable for people. I'm not saying bring in Moby for a 
party or Paul Oakdog, but sure as hell try an cater to peoples' wants. 
The only way europe is thriving is through mass acceptance of the 
culture, and the fact that people can enjoy the music.
SADLY, that hasnt worked in our country because people here dont enjoy 
the MUSIC! People here are used to hearing Top 40 hits that they can 
sing along to, rap songs they can rap with, and make them feel hard. 
Even most of the big trance songs that make it big have words in them . 
We are too much of a sit on our ass and listen to music country. Europe 
has more of a get up and do it vibe about it, and they arent ashamed to 
be a dance culture, and hence the rave has thrive for the past decade, 
where instead ours just remain the same. More factors go in to this, of 
course, and the government is to blame, but if things dont change, i 
see it being much worse.
I dont want to see people combining rock or rap with electronics, but 
if it helps, why the fuck not? Does anyone have a better idea up their 
sleave? Yah, go ahead up against that money making american idol 
industry that is dishing out what they think we should listen to. 
Personally, I don't like being spoon fed.
later,
alex tweak

an underground starts by a strong presense and a culture builds from a core foundation. techno built from a core foundation. it's tough to fight the cheese factor but if you have a strong underground, you bring in ther postitive aspects and intelligent people who are interested. 
btw do you like lab4? people claim this is good hard trance but everything i've heard from them was pretty boring and structured all f'd up. except one exception which was rapture towards the end.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} scene death?  what scene?

what scene death? I know tons of ravers and go to tons of raves, I can 
listen to electronic music every night of the week and have tons of 
options to choose from. I mean there aren't two 16+ parties every 
weekend any more but that's a good thing. so what's the big deal.

party prices haven't changed, drug prices haven't changed, cd prices 
haven't changed, there are still tons of DJs that would spin for free.

what's the problem?

Some of us live for this, but it seems that anyone that has been in the "scene" for more than a year now is either a dj/promoter/artists or leaves it.  i have seen a mass turnover in my time and it seems that as the years go by the turnover becomes faster and more robust.

I had such a blast tonight.  Ohio really does have it going on!!  Ppl
should come out and support this jungle lounge night @ spy bar, its dope

Now imagine me singing the theme song to the drew carey show -- "cleveland

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

is one of the names to watch in 2003. Having been booked all over the US 
and in Canada - look for a fresh set of the top dance tracks you will ever 
hear. His peak time sets create an amazing energy and you can expect the 
whole room to be dancing non-stop. He's now touring to support the release 
of his recent mixed CD - GENESIS and his upcoming vinyl album on his own 
Groove Reactor Records.
Quantum: Mythodic/CEG/Ritual - House/Progressive - Columbus, OH
To most DJs, the term "perfectionist" would seem a mighty compliment, but 
not to Columbus' DJ Quantum. To him, the word doesn't begin to convey his 
meticulous attention to detail when mixing; he is, in his own words, "More 
like an 'Obsessive-Compulsive Mix Freak.'" Citing eclectic musical tastes, 
Quantum's syrupy-smooth style is derived from musical influences like 
Danny 
Tenaglia, John Digweed and Steve Lawler. Much like the aforementioned 
artists, in his sets he stresses song selection and programming above 
tricks and gimmicks.
Nostalgic: Downtown Entertainment - Funky Breaks - Dayton, OH

Black, Ubiquity, 4hero's Reinforced, Papa, Talkin' Loud, Visions, Sonar
Kollektiv, Laws Of Motion, Versatile, Archive, Island/Def Jam..the list
goes on. Seiji's reputation as a DJ has also been on the rapid increase
over the past two years, touring Japan with Dego, taking in two US tours,
and playing around the UK and Europe every week at some of the top cutting
edge music clubs/events.

Sat Feb 01                           TRU                           Columbus

After much consideration I have decided to move all Rise events from Red 
Zone to 382 West Nationwide Blvd. known as Mekka, The Music Factory, The 
Factory, and the former Glow. 
To avoid legal complications I am switching the Rise name to Tru. All 
further events will be billed as Tru at the Factory. With the new space 
the level of production will be unlike anything before done in Columbus. 
The sound system is the same EAW line array system that most major touring 
acts bring with them for Arena shows. All lighting, laser, and visuals 
will be completely installed and programmed in time for Feb. 1. We have 
many plans to take the experience to the next level. You will be both 
pleased and hopefully amazed at what we plan to do. The talent lineup is 
among the top in the World. The first Tru event is Saturday Feb. 1st. 
To those of you who have been to Mekka in the last 6 weeks a few things.

1) The sound, what is currently in the venue is on loan from EAW. The far 
superior Line Array system was custom built for the room, and arrives and 
is installed the second week of January. It will amaze you with its 
clarity, and power.

2) Lights, 4 Mac 2000's have been on back order and arrive mid January, 
the current light show is less than 1/2 of what it will be.

3) Laser, It has not been programmed, or ulitized to 20% of its capability 
yet, Feb. 1, be prepared!!

4)Stage, headlining talent will be featured on stage, with full 
production. You will understand Feb. 1

5) visuals, Feb. 1

I ask for you support in this change, I feel that it is a positive 
evolution for the scene. I intend to surpass the quality level that has 
made Rise so successful.

Saturday, Feb. 1 The Premier of Tru at the Factory.

Talent:

BT (Exclusive DJ set)
www.BTMusic.com

First time to Columbus

Bill Hamel

+Special Surprise live act performing a former #1 smash hit.

Local DnB lineup will be added shortly in the Fresh room.

Sat Feb 01                   WISHING ON A STAR 3                     Dayton

Wishing Well & GrooveFuel LLC present
Wishing on a Star 3: Wishing Well 2 Year Anniversary
Dayton, OH - February 1, 2003

_hosted all night by Mc Jumper

_featuring the follow up to the Get Down tour, "The Feel The Rhythm Tour" 
with Paul Johnson and Translucent

_Paul_Johnson_(Dusttraxx)_Chicago
Paul has not let the wheelchair he is confined to slow him down in the 
studio or behind the decks. "Get Down", one of the hottest house tunes 
ever produced was played by everyone and their momma's. He will be 
releasing the follow up track, "Feel the Rhythm" on this awesome night so 
listen for it and be able to say "I was at the event where that track was 
released."

_Translucent_(Transparent, Dusttraxx)_Chicago
This very talented musician lays down the dopest house cuts and is a house 
legend in many eyes. Just wait til' he pulls out the trumpet and blows you 
away with the soul.

_Teebee_(Metalheadz, Subtitles, Certificate 18 )_Norway
DJ/producer Teebee spent ten years making his mark on the Norwegian drum 
'n' bass scene, but it only took one album and a handful of singles (on 
labels like Rugged Vinyl and Moving Shadow) to establish him as a major 
player in the elitist UK drum 'n' bass scene. Teebee now needs no 
introduction. He's become one of the major successes of the UK's 
forward-thinking Certificate 18 label, as well as winning the "Best 
International Producer" award from Knowledge Magazine in 2001. He's had 
releases on numerous labels, including Prototype, Juice, Creative Source, 
Moving Shadow, and many more, as well as releasing several mysteriously 
haunting R&B-flavored drum 'n' bass bootlegs. Additionally, he plays DJ 
gigs around the world, creating a stir with head-banging sets that run the 
gamut between dark and melodic sounds. More so than most DJs, he really 
gets involved in his sets, dancing about, pumping his fists, and 
transmitting an intense energy to the crowd.

_Venom_(Volume Prod.)_New Jersey
I have an idea that he is going to break out the live p.a. for this show 
and if you haven't seen it you are about to be amazed. This guy is so 
talented it isn't funny. Just wait as the dnb fused live show rocks you 
off your feet.

_The_Untouchables_-_Flagrant,_Sterling_+_Chango-Fatt_(Mustard 
Records-Australia)
Dopest hip hop duo with mc coming staight from the down under with mad 
Australian clothing giveaways. Flagrant and Sterling tore it up at Wishing 
2 now they are back to burn the tables down.

_Jen_Lasher_(Object Oriented Bliss, GrooveFuel AM)_www.groovefuel.com
A member of the Object-Oriented Bliss DJ collective and recently signed to 
GrooveFuel AM, Jen Lasher has come into her own as one of America's 
Breakbeat up and comers. Her smooth mixing skills and taste in phat beats 
have recently gained the attention of ReleaseArtistManagement, an 
international DJ roster as well as independent record label that works 
with many of the worlds top producers and DJs including Jackal & Hyde, 
Hyper, & Rick West.

Jen is no stranger to music production, not only is she contributing 
vocals to the next DJ Icey artist compilation, she's also working with 
Icey on a new track to be released in 2003. To top it all off, Jen keeps 
her style original and unique by incorporating her own tracks and vocals 
into DJ sets. In addition to her national tour dates, you can catch her at 
her residency in Baltimore, MD at Ultraworld's, Sonar Lounge. You don't 
want to miss Jen dropping her dope beats at Wishing on a Star 3.

_Nautigroove_(In The Groove)_Cincinnati
The man behind In The Groove and a soon to be family member, Jason lays 
down whatever it takes to make the crowd melt in his hands. If you have a 
love for music the way we do you do not want to miss this set so be ready 
to be taken into a state of pure bliss by the sounds of this expert.

_Sparky_Killabrew_(Wishing Well, Well Known)_KY
Sparky is coming to us off his last show opening for Nappy Roots and 
10,000 raging people. His turntablist tricks and beat juggling combined 
with his dope underground hip hop track selection, you better not miss it. 
He made his debut at the first Wishing and is now back to rock the joint.

_Rob_Riddum_(GF Music Factory)_Cleveland
Rob Riddum is one of the most well known and dedicated dnb djs in the Ohio 
scene today. The legacy began in 1996 as Riddum took his funky set to the 
streets as member of the popular Elements Squad. Now after producing 
tracks for Jackass and making a strong surge in the last year Rob is 
taking it to the next level.

_Dank_One_(Better Days, Alkaline Sound)Louisville
The man behind A*S*S, the sound system that will be rocking rooms in 
Dayton from now on, Kevin will be laying many drum and bass tracks of his 
and many other producers, that are on the cutting edge of the dnb genre.

_Lil'_Cory_(NateFx)_Lexington, KY
Cory has been itching to hit Ohio on the house tip so let's rock. He will 
be hitting us hard with a dope booty house set that is guaranteed not to 
disappoint anyone. Get ready to "Hit it From the Back".

_Matt_Freeman_(Flashpoint, Illuminators)_Dayton
Matt has been rocking the decks long enough to know, that he rocks the 
decks. Making his 3rd straight Wishing On A Star appearance make some 
noise for the man who never disappoints.

_Nimby_(American Cheese)_Cincinnati_w/_Mc Jumper_(Neutral Music, 
RPC)_Rochester
This is the first time these happy hardcore gurus will perform together so 
be sure not to miss this set. Nimby has been setting the standard for 
hardcore in Ohio for the past couple of years and is now ready to "Rise to 
the Top" like a "Shooting Star" as he throws down an oldskool anthem set.

_Dorian_(4-Score, Inneraction, Vinyl Beats)_Nashville, Tennessee
A staple in the Nashville DnB scene since 1997, Dorian's mixing and 
scratching technique will leave you in awe. We're not one to gossip, but 
word has it, he is a master at toe scratching.

_Centrex_(Unified Ent, Breakline Crew)_Cincinnati
His mixing is flawless and the track selection will make your body butta 
from dancin'. Letting people know that breaks is on the rise, Tom is one 
part of the infamous Breakline Crew consisting of Cyberspeed, Clay-Born, 
Kitsonik, Bobby Bedlam, APX, Breakthrough, and Annalyze.

_Clay-Born_(Wishing Well, Breakline Crew)_Louisville
He might play alot of Wishing Well/Groovefuel events but he never fails to 
rock it and is our little buddy who we rescued from the sounds of hard 
house a couple of years ago. That's right if you were at Shamrock in 
Columbus you saw him rip some Uk Hard House, but that is all in the past.

_Foursqare_(Wishing Well, Hushabye House)_Louisville
Marea has taken her love for house music to a whole new level. Now one of 
the best house djs our area has to offer, she has created a following of 
househeads, partykids, and just plain music enthusiasts that just can't 
help but shake their booties to the sounds of "The Lady".

_Subnet_(GF Music Factory)_Cincinnati
Music Factory introduces Subnet... Rooted in progressive styles of house 
and trance, the signature Subnet sound has evolved to a banging techno 
that is nothing short of cutting edge. Impressive to even the most savvy 
ear, his sound is grounded in fresh, energetic track selection and 
seamless mixing. Everyone come check Matt out at his first Wishing Well / 
GrooveFuel performance.

_Anita_DeCastro_(Scarab Records)_Indianapolis
This young funky breaks master is making her way into what is soon to be a 
great breaks scene here in the Midwest. At the young age of 18, the future 
is looking very bright and from here the sky is the limit.

_Def_Leper_(Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids)
If you have yet to see this crazy lunatic rip your intestines out and sing 
to them, you need to be main stage at when the music starts to hear him. 
Let's just say if you are under 18 hold your ears, haha.

The closest Paul has come to Ohio has been Chicago. It speaks volumes for 
our scene that he would come to play. If you look at his past gigs you 
will see that Columbus is by far the smallest city in North America that 
Paul has ever played. Thank you for helping me make this possible.

Now with that being said. This event is being promoted throughout the 
entire midwest. Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania & Ohio. I higly 
recommend getting your presale tickets NOW because there is the strong 
possibility of this event selling out. We are talking with both 
Ticketmaster and ticketweb and we will have them online with one of the 
services by the end of this week.
Presales start at only $25.

GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well present
One Love
Northeast, OH - February 22, 2003

The production tandem of GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well trek north with 
some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, New York, Florida, California and many other states 
representing. This is an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio 
and see how much of a great scene we are and what we can produce if we 
cooperate. We have selected many dj's and have gotten full support from 
surrounding crews to bring you the following crowd rockers:

_Dj Rap_(Proper Talent)_L.A.
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live 
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londonís Charissa Saverio, aka DJ 
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes 
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female, 
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of 
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent, 
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via 
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of 
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the 
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and 
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)_L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back 
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and 
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC 
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As 
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the 
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene." To this day, Feelgood remains 
one of the most beloved DJs in the country. From Coast to Coast and from 
week to week he can be seen spinning at landmark clubs such as Twilo, 
Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild popularity overseas. With 
Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak hour house sets only one 
question remains - Can You Feel It?

20KFreaks and GrooveFuel AM present
_the CUT N DROP tour
20KFreaks.com_20K_006 /_FACTORe /_jackal & hyde_remix

Set to release March 2003, CUT N DROP is sure to be the next dance floor 
smash. A-side, the original mix by FACTORe, the staple of the 20KFreaks 
label. B-side, a remix by one of electro-core's most talented and proven 
producer tandems, Jackal & Hyde. Keep your eyes on the record store 
shelves and be the first to get your breakbeat happy hands on the highly 
anticipated 20KFreaks release of CUT N DROP and join us February 22 and 
experience two of the world's breakbeat elite live, in your face.

featuring /_Jackal's_Digital_Mix, FACTORe, & Odissi

FIRST NORTHERN OHIO APPEARANCE!
_Jackal's_Digital_Mix_( Hallucination Recordings / GrooveFuel AM )_Miami, 
FL

Icey and Baby Anne have brought his tracks to Ohio countless times but, 
the hour is finally near for Ohio to welcome the true prognosticator of 
Florida breakbeat and mayhem, Jackal. Best known for his involvement in 
the electro-core tandem of Jackal & Hyde, producer/performer Scott Weiser 
is nothing short of a living legend in electronic music. His most recent 
contribution to breakbeat and house heads across the world: Jackal 
Digital Mix Set - an hour of energy and controlled techno mayhem from the 
mind of a master madman. Off the chain would be an understatement. Tie 
your roofs down and hide your kids because Jackal is coming to town.

Scott Weiser (Jackal) needs no introduction, both of his groups Jackal & 
Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables 
from Los Angeles to Berlin. -URB MAGAZINE

_FACTORe_( 20KFreaks / GrooveFuel AM )_Birmingham, AL

The staple of the 20kFreaks label, FACTORe is one of the most talented and 
respected breatbeat DJs and producers in the industry. Behind the decks 
since the early 80s, he's been ripping it since most of you were in 
diapers. When FACTORe throws down his pounding breakbeat, there won't be 
an ass that isn't shakin'. Come experience the past, present, and future 
of breakbeat as FACTORe brings his signature style and class on the CUT N 
DROP Tour. The tour was first named the "All The Tracks We Produced That 
You Thought Were Icey's" Tour, but, turned out that CUT N DROP was a lot 
shorter and fit on the record.

Groove Reactor Records and Buckwyld Entertainment Presents:

BACK TO THE BASICS 3
March 1st, 2003
Southwest, Ohio

It's been over 4.5 years now, and we're still going strong. We've thrown 
massives, club events, intimate events, and we keep coming back for more! 
On this night, we will revive the series that started it all - BACK TO THE 
BASICS! This event is exactly that - a return to the old school. We've 
secured an intimate 1 room venue, an awesome sound system, a killer lineup 
and the kind of old school atmosphere and decorations that got a lot of us 
into the scene long ago. We will be giving away hundreds of copies of 
D8A's newest CD, and we will be powering our evening's visuals with 
another laser to blow you away.

LINEUP:

House, Tribal House - Continuing in our tradition of bringing out the very 
best of the east coast DJS, it's our pleasure to bring one the biggest 
proponents of dance music in the USA. A DJ since 1995, Knowledge has his 
hands in almost every aspect of the electronic music industry. On top of 
his impressive DJ credentials which includes shows all over the US and 
Canada, he also runs one of the east coasts premiere production 
companies. To date, he has thrown over 75 parties and runs a successful 
club night in CT. Knowledge has produced material released on K:cid and is 
working on another release for 2003. His first fully licensed CD will be 
out in 2003 and he will be giving away plenty of free promos of his latest 
demo - LIVE AT BOO 7. His style is one that fuses together techo, house, 
progressive and tribal. Knowledge continues to be one of the driving 
forces behind the success of the east coast movement and it is our 
pleasure to bring him to Southwest, Ohio. Check out some of his live sets

he took home first place in the Spin Cycle DJ Battle in Louisville, KY 
last year. His flawless mixing and scratching tactics are sure to leave 
you in awe. Once he is behind the decks you will know the vibe is alive!

coming to you live & direct from Nashvegas bringing you a taste of the 
innovative ole'school intelligent broken beats. A rising name in the 
Southeast dnb scene, Ben has shared the stage with such prestigious acts 
as Ming & Fs, Soulslinger, TC Islam and Dieselboy, to name a few. Ben has 
spent the last year spreading the rinsed out mash'em up koncrete message 
with the Ill Factor along with the Spacemen in and around Florida. His 
Ohio appearance will not be one to miss.

KITSONIK: House, Breakbeat, 2Step, Trance www.unifiedent.com, 
www.wellknowndjs.com,
www.airplaneclique.com - Cincinnati, OH The Kitsonik sound is a moving 
progressive blend of Breaks, House, 2Step and Trance. She is known for 
both her energetic and sassy presence behind the decks and her ability to 
throw down and almost any style of music flawlessly. There is never a dull 
moment when she performs and she likes to keep the crowd on their toes by 
layering different musical genres. This flexibility is also shown through 
her mixed CDs where she has released 2 House/2Step and 2 Trance 
compilations, her latest being Hearthouse II.

D8A: SPECIAL OLD SCHOOL ACID HOUSE SET - www.groovereactor.com, Buckwyld - 
Dayton, OH - Over time, D8A has developed a unique style that always 
pleases. Ranging from the hardest hitting house and on into harder German 
techno/ trance, you can always expect to see the crowd dancing during his 
sets. Tonight though, D8A is preparing a special treat NOT TO BE MISSED. 
He will be dropping an ultra-rare acid house set with some of those 
long-ago heard gems and recent underground acid tracks that will truly 
take you BACK TO THE BASICS. If you were around in the glory days of acid 
house and like the older styles of DJ Pierre or Terry Mullan, this will be 
the set you've been wanting to hear!

NELSON: www.glasscityrecords.com / Black Sun Entertainment - Funky Disco 
House, Toledo, OH - Nelson is one of the biggest supporters and proponents 
of the NW, Ohio scene and he's developed the scene into something special. 
Including the launch of his own Glass City Records, his NW, Ohio message 
board www.glasscityrecords.com and his successful run of club and one-off 
events, it's no wonder the word is quickly spreading. His funky-filtered 
house sounds will surely keep everyone begging for more.

MATT ROBERTS: Unpredictable Entertainment / Glass City Records - Techno - 
Toledo, OH - Matt will be bringing some down the hard techno sounds from 
Toledo and will be drawing on the Detroit influences who have made the 
sound what it is today. Plenty of wicked drum codes and percussion, 
combined with his flawless mixing will surely help to set the tone of the 
party.

CATNAP vs. DEF LEPER: Mecha Studios - Hardcore, Gabber, Who Knows - 
Columbus & Springfield, OH - There is no question that when these two take 
the stage the sparks will fly. Expect to be entertained with audio and 
visual sensations of hardcore, gabber, and noisecore and a little bit of 
everything in between. Plenty of people have asked for another tag team 
between these two see get here early to hear them duke it out!

OOMPA LOOMPA: Trance - Cincinnati, OH - Oompa has made quite a name for 
himself this past year and the demand to see him spin increases every 
weekend. He brought some major bombs down at Bumpin and Jumpin 2 and it's 
our pleasure to bring him in again for some more mayhem!

He's actually a white supremacist. If you ever see a really tall,
muscular guy with a shaved head and a big swatika tattoo on his left
calf - that's Nick S.

hey everybody, lets start spouting off racist bigotry so that we can
dehumanize groups of people even more, great idea.  While we're at it, lets
add in some propoganda like swastikas and then stereotype everyone with a
shaved head as supremacists.

I'm being salty, but this bullshit honestly doesnt have any point of
relevance on this list.

Subject: {pb-cle} Dub (was: scene death)

1) I have listened to it. I'm actually quite a big fan of it.

And in that fan-dom, I can recognize the crap from the classics. King Tubby, Lee Perry, Agustus
Pablo...these guys birthed it, nurtured it, and turned it into a cottage industry...until the rest
of the world caught up with them...and unleashed DnB and a million other genres.

2) More than anything, I was playing devil's advocate for a few moments. I CERTAINLY wasn't hating
on it.

But the fact remains that if you take the reggae/dancehall backing out of dub, it ceases to be dub
and becomes something else. In that way, there ARE rigidly defined rules.

Dub, by its mere definition and the way it was created, limits itself. It was created as the b-side
of the single, allowing the selector a chance to work out and have more creativity with the playing
of the record, to extend the track by a couple more minutes, to keep the groove going. This is a
good thing.

But at its heart:
    Instrumental, w/ heavy layers of effects
+  snippets of vocal performance also buried in effects = DUB

Whereas, you can sample a million different musical genres, incorporate literally hundreds of
different instrumentations, chord structures, vocals, and sounds, and you can still fall well within
the structure of music known as Drum N Bass.

So it's not that I don't like it or i'm "hating" as you put it Nick. And I fully recognize the
influence and impact it's had on other musical genres, but I still think it's pretty limited in
scope and malleability.



<<as much as i hate to do it...i have to agree with tom...if you think dub is a predictable and
lacking orginality, you obviously dont listen to it...you can get dub tunes that sound like jamician
ska from the late 50s...all the way up to the hottest dancehall riddums coming out of the yard
today...furthermore if it werent for dub...we wouldnt have hiphop(bambatta and kool herc learned
their style of dj'ing from jamician selektas)...we probably wouldnt have acid house or jungle/dnb or
2step/uk garage/speed
garage as we know it either...cuz most of the early producers of these styles grew up on a steady
diet of dub reggae...oh yeah....and those giant soundsystems we all love at raves...we wouldnt have
those either...cuz rave soundsystems are direct decendents of reggae systems(more subs than 2way
speakers)...and lastly there'd be no such thing as dub-plates(you didnt just think it was a catchy
name did you?)>>

Yup yup... Sly was one of the first to have some of his own SERIOUS modular synth gear.

I said I wouldn't get into this whole thread..but I just can't resist.  I really like what Doug and Jamie had to say...so I just couldn't resist adding. (or completely going off on another tangent perhaps)  
Personally, the scene probably isn't dying it's just not at the ideal people want it to be, nor as they remember.  
What first got you involved in the scene?  Were you all about the details, the issues, or were you into riding that wave of excitement from music that made you feel, and just a sense of belonging?
I dunno, perhaps it's cliche but how many people once upon a time believed the following?
PEACE:State of harmony among groups 
LOVE:Feeling deep passion for something 
UNITY:The state of being combined with others to form a greater whole 
RESPECT:To show regard or consideration for.

(sorry for the grammar lesson....but really, think about what the words really mean, there's really some depth when the definitions are combined)

You know, it really is a great formula....doesn't work if it's not followed though.  Call me an idealist but I hate to see people tearing each other up over details.  The details are great, without them life would be so boring.   If everyone liked the same kind of music, and we were all alike we'd still be listening to what our parents did.  Thank god for diverse opinions---they create growth!   For those that argue and tear others down, do you really want a scene?  Scene involves a crowd...and if you get a crowd you're going to have to deal with people who are different, who possibly have opposing opinions, different attitudes, lifestyles, you name it....personally, I love the idea, but does everyone?
There's a way to answer this "question" with a reasonable solution or answer if people respect one another, keep their minds open, maintain passion for what you believe in though, and commit to adding something positive.  Nothing can come from nothing though....so what can come of negativity?  (0+0=0, 0+1 STILL equals 0, etc...) The potential for a scene can lay right here on all the members of this very board and all the people we all know....our attitudes are what can make or break what we want to see happen.  
I dunno, maybe we should all just go back to kindergarten and learn how to get along and play nicely.

look man, ive gotta do something to stick up for the roots of the
music, because aint no one else doing it. im embarassed at what
white people take for granted from other cultures, and in the
electronic music scene alone, almost all the cats getting all the
credit and all the fame and all the money are white. if it wasnt
like that, if this country and this music industry and this music
genre most specifically didnt suffer from pretty blatant racism, i
wouldnt have to argue like this. all the people who deserve credit
would get it. unfortunately, due to this racism, they dont get
shit. and even in the dance press, almost no one sticks up for
them. but i will, because they made the best music, and it
influenced a ton of people including me, and i will see to it that
they receive their props from at least one person who is willing
to call out all this other trash music thats ripped them off in
order to sell tons of copies to white kids. 

>God forbid someone try to take their own spin on things, roll
with their own 
>experiences and feelings, and create something a little bit
different out of 
>it.

i have no problem with people, even white people, taking something
done by some other ethnicity and doing something new with it. what
it all comes down to is who gets credit for it and who makes money
from it. i dont particularly like fatboy slim, but because he
always tells interviewers in big magazines that his heroes are
black american techno producers, i dont get on his ass at all. he
lets people know whats up. he knows that he's getting unneccessary
amounts of attention specifically because he's not a black guy.
just take a look at how any black musician or artist is marketed
in this country. you get to either be a hiphop emcee, or an r+b
singer, otherwise you either dont get any popularity in the first
place, or in the few cases like lenny kravitz, you get marketed to
white audiences as "alternative" music. and in the case of
electronic music, its marketed to white kids, but they dont even
get to have the black artists who innovated it in the first place,
they get 3rd generation crackers sold to them. 

>You don't think you are being more true to music as an art by
respecting a 
>listener's emotions, regardless of what it is?

i told you, a listener's emotions in response to music are totally
meaningless to anyone except the individual. the emotions that
matter are those that go into making the music in the first place.
and making music to copycat something else and whiten it for mass
consumption has NO emotion.

thats not true at all. dub was a remixing technique more than
anything else, though it was mainly used in reggae for the first
part of its life, its since gone on to be applied to anything else.

and you can make a dub of any genre of music, check the b sides of

dubs that are instrumentals with little bits of dubbed vocals and

i would seriously say that dub and drum and bass and jazz are the

rely on so few specific ideas that they can be spread around so
many ways.......

that seems to be another way to spoonfeed people
instead of nurture the vibe. 

i like what that girl said from nyc that chris had in
one of the first replies to this thread.... just go
with the flow. all you can really do is be yourself,
when it comes down to it. if you love this or that,
then that love will make something happen. trying to
rally people that cant feel what youre feeling is just
frustrating.

just lean forward with an idea and let your passion do
the rest. someone will feel the same way and join your
team.

king tubby was remixing in the late 60's.

i really dont understand where this is coming from. considering
the progression of house and techno alongside new wave and
kraftwerk, they were similar but both were stealing from disco, a
predominantly black and gay form of music.

>ya saturday night fever, rent it. lots of white djs. in fact it
was mainly italian djs that started disco. i know old school disco
djs. i'm not talkin 79 disco larry leavan or knuckles either.

what italian deejays? even the euro producers who got popular with
machiney beats like moroder were using black female singers on
their tracks because thats the music they were emulating.

its alot less: aphrodite/mickey finn, doc scott, hype, uhhhhhhh.

even if it is 50/50 now, its all about where it started man. you

okay, i know that 2-step is part of house and techno's continuum.
thats my entire argument. prog house is a deviant from that, it
took what was dominantly black forms of music and turned it into a
less funky less soulful club music that is massively popular with
white people. prog is to house and techno as kenny g is to jazz
music.

thats great. keep people dancing in ignorance. id rather play the
real shit to no one than play crap to 10,000 people.

im sure alot of people are really passionate about nu-metal and
emo. as a matter of fact, i KNOW they are. i see them all the
time. it doesnt mean that theyre not ignorant of the quality of
the crap they choose to listen to. i care about music that is
worth caring about.

nah. justifying shit because someone lieks it is wrong. is killing

how is that exactly? i play anything from house to techno to
electro to 2-step to pop records to dub to funk to whatever. i
love all music that is true to itself and true to the emotions of
the people making it. banging white guy club music isnt true to
any emotion except getting drunk and or fucked up people on a
dance floor. that shit is weak. and record i spin when i deejay
will sound as good or better when youre chilling out at your house
trying to relax. its good music, not dancefloor fodder.

i really dont understand how i could ever be called "blinded" to
music. my collection of music is insanely diverse, and i would put
it up against the collection of anyone ive ever met in my life.
the shit i stay far far away from is shit that blatantly rips off
good music in order to shift units: electroclash, prog house,
trance, hard house, nu-metal, pop punk, etc. that music is
horrible, its a money making source, not art. i love art. i hate
people trying to capitalize off of it by watering it down.

>no, because of pretentious bullshit just like this running
rampant through
>just about everything that goes on.

where is there any pretense? as a matter of fact, i think the
electronic music scene wouldnt be in the doldrums its currently in
if it had more pretentiousness. look at long established scenes
like techno and house/garage, theyre still doing fine in their own
world outside of raving because they have enough substance that
theyre not just a fad or a money maker for club deejays.

thats funny. considering the fact that i havent missed watching a
steelers game in years, i wouldnt say im not interested in the
super bowl. what im not interested in is bitch ass rich gannon
getting his ass layed out by warren sapp. its no contest. what do
they say about defense? it wins championships. tampa will win by
at least 14. your precious oakland shouldnt have let gruden go.

uh, okay. if you say so. in my world people would respect good
music instead of trying to find the easiest beat to dance to with
no substance behind it. and really, its only because so few people
truly care about music that things are not that way.

I think they wanted to make this huge surrounding sound, hitting you
from four directions.  With noises responding to each other in front of
you and in back of you, from side to side.  I think the album was more
about the art of noise rather than musical and note structure.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} scene death?  what scene? WHAT THE SCENE NEEDS

I think the scene (and yes there IS one)
could use is a knod back to the past.

We need to go back and remember that there
are more than just dancers and Djs involved
in the EM community.

There are fashion designers, artists, sculpturerererers,
and others involved as well... an event should incorporate
as many aspects of our community as possible...

If I get back to promoting (which is unlikely), I'd like
to incorporate locals fashion designers for a show, local
artists for a make-shift gallery, and (always) a political
booth with info on upcoming laws that may affect us, how
to protect yourself and your rights, and a voting registration.

I think events need to be more than just book some sound, 
lights, and Djs, and let kids ramsack a space.

I thought I read that she was an "adult entertainer" type 
model... but I thought that was a long time ago... like 
before she got on the Dj circuit.

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP : Jwan Allen @ Touch (afterhours) pgh

Just a heads up. I'll be dropping some tunes down @ the Touch 
afterhours in East Liberty (behind Citizen Bank), this Friday 
night. So come out and hear a special birthday (I'll be 27) 
selection of only the  finest house and techno on wax.

this will be another weekend of no sleep, since I'm heading up to 
toronto frist thing in the morning to catch Carl Craig (one of my 
idols) tear it up on saturday night.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} scene death? what scene?

>because thats how it goes man. shit all starts somewhere.

I don't think that good ideas all started with one person though.

Remember that thread about the "Bump" flyer? It was pretty much agreed that 
at least two more more unrelated persons thought of that idea, which wasn't 
so unbelievably fantastic to begin with.

Maybe its because of the environment and culture that I am growing up in, 
but the idea to take someone else's music and tailor it to your own ways 
doesn't seem that amazing. I honestly can't believe that it all began with a 
single man.

I agree with you. I really do think its great that you are standing up for 
what you believe in and giving credit where credit is due, and the blatant 
racism in pretty much any corporate industry is disgusting. But it seems 
like you are being racist against genres simply because of what genre they 
are, automatically assuming that any producer of that genre is working on 
reprocessed emotionless crap for the masses...classifying music is stupid in 
the first place, other than historical for historical reference.

>i told you, a listener's emotions in response to music are totally
>meaningless to anyone except the individual. the emotions that
>matter are those that go into making the music in the first place.

Wouldn't the emotions that go into making music in the first place be 
personal and individual as well? "This is a product of my emotion. I am 
offering it to all to listen to and interpret it however they see fit". So 
maybe a white guy related to a black guy's song. Maybe he said "you know, I 
really feel what you are saying here, but what I feel is just a little bit 
different. I think I will make music that attempts to convey my particular 
feelings."

It just all seems skin deep to me. Feelings are feelings and music is music. 
Aren't they both meant to be shared? How can you "steal" someone's emotions 
in the first place? If I start producing a track right now, and it takes me 
5 years to do it, I really put my heart in soul into converying the feelings 
and emotions that I go through... who do I give credit to? I will give 
credit to the artists who I have listened to in the past and who have helped 
me shape my feelings into written song.  But what if it falls under the 
"progressive house" genre. Automatically all of these black guys and Tom Cox 
are gonna say I am stealing their music and its just reprocessed garbage?


Don't get me wrong, I know exactly what you are talking about when you say 
"and making music to copycat something else and whiten it for mass
consumption has NO emotion." I agree 100%, but it seems to me that you 
aren't giving credit to those who may actually deserve it (the people who 
genuienly put forth feeling and emotion into what they made), but because 
you have already labeled them they do not have a chance of being "true" in 
your eyes.

I probably made some mistakes in this e-mail, but I have minced it enough to 
where I don't want to go back and read over it again. I hope you are 
understand what I am trying to say

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Techno and house are not Disco. Disco is still there. They didn't change 
disco. They may have been influenced by it, but I don't see how being 
influenced by music and making your own is considered "stealing".

So I guess the Sony owes Nintendo royalties because they stole their idea to 
have an interactive video game on the television screen.

"But Nintendo was there first, so therefore anyone who plays nintendo 
products is obviously more genuine and true than those copycat assholes at 
sony."

i've been going since the begginning of 1998, and I have not noticed a 
negative decline. I have seen changes, but they haven't been fundamental 
or negative or anything like that. It's more of what kind of music gets 
booked, and who the really big headliners are. But sorry, no horrible 
agonizing death.

Subject: {pb-cle} scene death...

ok
i'll make this short. all i have to say on this is
really two points: 1) for my part i'm as much of a
purist as anyone, and i'll talk all day on the merits
and faults of all types of music, but at the end of
the day it's just my OPINION. there's still gonna be
people who disagree, but i'll get more people to come
out and support what i'm doing if i try to be open to
things i dont like than if i only have what i like
available. we all want to have a party with just OUR
favorite djs/music, but if we do everything will be
smaller. that may not be a bad thing, but that's the
way it is. so if we want to see a "united" scene, we
HAVE to respect other people and there taste, even if
we personally can't stand it. this is as hard for me
as anyone sometimes, but i make an effort. so much for
making this short, damn!
2)i could be wrong (of course) but i believe i'm
sensing a small but palpable upswing in the scen here
in pgh, again i want to stress it's tiny, but things
are better than they were say 6 or 8 months ago, more
people are coming out, and more importantly i think
more people are coming out for the music more than for
the drinks and the social scene. i'm looking forward
to the warmer season, because if we can all stop
fighting it could be a real good season for the
"scene." i for one am ready to spin my ass off for
little or no pay just because i love it, as anyone who
has booked me will tell you. i know i'm not alone. and
i know i'm going to keep doing it either way, big
scene or small scene. that's all i have to say about
it.
sure did take me a while to say so little!

I remember installing Roadrunner in this guy's basement in Akron a few 
years ago, he was a hip hop producer and we got to talking after I 
commented on his huge racks of synths.  He was telling me that he knows 
alot of people in the hip hop community that pay the bills by writing the 
background music to some of the cheezy dance music (with some dumb white 
kid singing over).  He just laughed, and said that it was a good thing all 
around because the singing kids (who have no other talent) can have backups 
and the hip hop producers can afford the equipment they need to write their 
own tracks.

He said that most of the time, they are embarrassed at how lame the song 
becomes and don't ask much credit.

Subject: {pb-cle} pink floyd trance remix

hey I was browsing through the CDDB today and notice that there seems to 
be some sort of trance remix of pink floyd's 'the division bell', anyone 
heard it? anyone got a copy on their HD? I can't find it on gnutella.

Subject: {pb-cle} Abbasso tonight

Just wanted to give a big thanks to those who clue me into Abbasso's
Thursday night open tables night.  I went tonight and spun out a short set
and had a blast.  Most people probably won't care, but I had a good time
and it was good to meet some new folks for once.

Because its alot my challenging and fun to put it on four,  not to mention 
how un-commercial something like that is.  I have a friend who said that 
they tried it, and after about two hours they finally got it to work and was 
all lined up.  He never said if the payoff was worth the hassle.

I think its cool, its just that I didn't think it would sound all that much 
different coming out of 4 stereos (which I do not own, but then agian.. if 
you need 4 people...yeah) than it would coming out of just once with 
surround sound.

...maybe it was a code to unlock the Gate of Karash? (GoK)

yeah but the idea of techno as straight up techno and house and

places at a specific time.

believe it. many genres have started because of one idea that one 
guy had. hiphop, dub, techno, it goes on and on. older forms of 
music probably had one person or a small group of people at their 
inception who made it all possible, it just wasnt so easily 
recorded. remember, the concept of selling recorded music is still 
only about 100 years old tops. and even in that time, some of the 
innovators in their genres didnt necessarily get to record and 
release records, check all the delta blues cats for a good 
example.

i dont believe it is hard to tell when music is being made just to 
cash in. if you look, you can even find examples of great 
musicians trying to cash in on some random fad and it sounds 
horrible because its not coming from inside of them. 

>Wouldn't the emotions that go into making music in the first 
place be 
>personal and individual as well? "This is a product of my 
emotion. I am

fit". 

i dont necessarily agree with this idea. some people have no 
problem with things being interpreted differently than they were 
made, in fact Seal never reveals his lyrics just so people can 
believe that theyre whatever they like. personally, i find music 
that has no emotion in it to be useless. by your standards, a 
track made entirely by a machine processing a random algorithim 
can be as meaningful as a song written from someone's soul, and 
that is simply not right. youre more into that "toneshifting" crap 
idea that darwin goes on and on about when he's posting on here. i 
dont see the point, if you want to be so arrogant as to lay your 
experiences over the experiences of the people making the music in 
the first place, i think thats pretty rude. why did they bother 
making it in the first place? if you dont think they have 
something good to say, why not just listen to nothing? if all that 
matters to you is your emotions when listening to a track, then 
you should be able to manipulate your emotions any way you like 
without any music being present. personally, i cater to my 
emotions by keeping a huge stock of emotionally diverse music, so 
that no matter what my emotion is, i can find something that i can 
use to wallow in it or to change it.

and plenty of white people have done that. shit, look at my top 10 
albums of 2002, it includes albums by the streets and the red hot 
chili peppers, both of whom borrowed heavily from black styles of 
music without doing it just to whiten the sound and cash in. they 
remained true to their roots even while stretching beyond them. i 
have the utmost respect for those kinds of artists.

if you put 5 years into writing a song, and it came out as 
progressive house, id feel really sorry for you. there just isnt 
room in that genre for that kind of feeling. the potential just 
isnt there. this is demonstrated by the whole "progressive" 
mindset that new music is going to be better, and that sounds 
should always be changing. this is all about the timelessness 
arguemnt that i brought up when discussing how good music is 
objective. progressive house is quite simply just a pounding dance 
beat, its very superficial. 

>Don't get me wrong, I know exactly what you are talking about 
when you say

that you

because

>your eyes.

like i said, the idea of progessive house is that all the things 
that made house music great in the first place are removed. it is 
emotionally vacant music, which is why its so easy for people to 
dance to without having to think about it. the whole concept that 
the music is based on removes it from the possibility of being 
good music. its like that infamous "jack's house" vocal. you 
know "house is a feeling" right? yeah, well house is a feeling, 
not a 4 on the floor kick drum. progressive house takes some of 
the sounds of house, but none of the feeling, and thats why its 
not any good. 

>I probably made some mistakes in this e-mail, but I have minced 
it enough to 
>where I don't want to go back and read over it again. I hope you 
are 
>understand what I am trying to say

i feel your concerns, but i swear they are all simply addressed by 
looking at the intentions of the people producing the music. any 
music that is "throwaway" music is not any good. good music is 
good today, tomorrow, yesterday. it'll be good 25 years from now. 
do you really think people 25 years from now will be rocking that 
ill seb fontaine mix cd? hell no. 

>Techno and house are not Disco. Disco is still there. They didn't 
change 
>disco. They may have been influenced by it, but I don't see how 
being 
>influenced by music and making your own is considered "stealing".

they didnt steal disco. they certainly adapted it, but they kept 
the spirit while enhancing other certain areas. house and techno 
sound good mixed with disco because they share so much in common 
without having to really sound the same or even similar in some 
cases. mixing prog house and disco would sound atrocious, theyre 
just not of the same kind of music. 

>So I guess the Sony owes Nintendo royalties because they stole 
their idea to

>
>"But Nintendo was there first, so therefore anyone who plays 
nintendo 
>products is obviously more genuine and true than those copycat 
assholes at

no, but its easy to see the triumph in most of today's video games 
of style over substance. instead of really feeling the concept and 
making a cool game, designers substitute good looking graphics for 
a good fun game and thats why alot of older games are still more 
fun to play today than newer ones are. this example specifically 
is a really good one to prove my point: you can copy sounds or 
looks, but you cant copy a feeling. the feeling is what matters.

see, this is exactly what im talking about. its so lame that 
people cant tell the difference between good music written from 
the heart and music written to cash in, but they cant. in dance 
music in particular i think this is a problem because the method 
of listening to electronic music is so different from any other 
kind, its unlike listening to rock, or hiphop, or anything. i 
guess its closest to jazz, but its still not exactly the same. 
most people just dont have enough experience breaking their mind 
to listen to music in a different way than theyre used to (typical 
top 40 programming) and thus they cant tell a deep emotional dance 
track from sandstorm. im telling you, the entire genres of dance 
that i pick on are useful mainly to people with no experience 
listening to music who really shouldnt try to have an opinion on 
music in the first place.

I represent the 216

anyway I think that reading urb is part of your problem

you should make an effort to get lots of people to attend
the same events as you do. get some flyers, pass them out
the rave scene is not about having someone show you a
good time, you've got to participate, even if your
participation is being the really drunk obnoxious guy
(me at peabody's on tuesday, woohoo!)
anyway, i'm getting off track, stop complaining, you
could live in some cold, ugly place where they haven't
even heard of raves, or electronic music, then what
you be doing

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dub (was: scene death)

<<and you can make a dub of any genre of music, check the b sides of house and just about any other
genre of music and you will find dubs that are instrumentals with little bits of dubbed vocals and
whatnot. >>

But that doesn't make it "Dub" as in the genre of the music. If Ian Pooley does a "dub mix" of a
track, it's STILL a house track...it doesn't magically become a dub track.

The pioneers of Dub (the genre) developed a method of remixing a track, and it became its own genre,
since they couldn't call it anything else...there was nothing to compare it to...

Now, contemporary artists from other genres take the techniques employed by the pioneers of the Dub
(the genre), and applied them to their own musical genre. But the music is still house/hip-hop/drum
n bass...just by using their techniques doesn't make it Dub (the genre). Dub, by its own definition,
is a by-product of reggae/dancehall.

You can't line up a Lee Perry track next to Deep Dish's "dub mix" of "Like I Love You" and tell me
that they're the same thing. They aren't. They may employ the same ideas and/or techniques, but they
are two distinctly different styles of music.

<<i would seriously say that dub and drum and bass and jazz are the least confined musics. you can
do a million things with them, they rely on so few specific ideas that they can be spread around so
many ways.......>>

I agree...except for the inclusion of Dub.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} pink floyd trance remix

I'm checking my resources now...

I was rifling through my MP3 cd's the other day, and happened upon a "trance mix" of Floyd's "Have A
Cigar" of all things...

But it's OLLLLLLD style trance...more like The Orb's style of "ambient house" than what we reference
as trance today...the BPM had to clock in somewhere around 114-120... it sounded somewhat dated, but
good nonetheless.

I also stumbled upon Orbital's remix of Madonna's "Bedtime Story"...that's a great fuckin track. I
have to slide that in a set somewhere very very soon....

It's all about 1992,
m

Thanks to Colin Pierce for playing such a great set last night ... some of

And thanks to all the insane people that braved the cold, came out, made it 
to the club and then drank alot only to get back in their cars to drive home

Good job.

you should make an effort to get lots of people to attend

the rave scene is not about having someone show you a

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dub (was: scene death)

---------- Original Message ----------------------------------
From: "[mark]" <hypnotyza@brads.net>

>But that doesn't make it "Dub" as in the genre of the music. If 
Ian Pooley does a "dub mix" of a
>track, it's STILL a house track...it doesn't magically become a 
dub track.
>
>The pioneers of Dub (the genre) developed a method of remixing a

compare it to...

but the idea didnt magically form into its own genre until years 
later. there's a certain division between straight up dubs or 
versions on the b-sides and the later Dub LPs that became popular. 

>Now, contemporary artists from other genres take the techniques 
employed by the pioneers of the Dub

music is still house/hip-hop/drum
>n bass...just by using their techniques doesn't make it Dub (the 
genre). Dub, by its own definition,
>is a by-product of reggae/dancehall.

but if that is true, then how can something like mad professor be 
considered dub? he was using all drum machines and synths which 
was not part of reggae at the time, at least not like he was using 
it. and what about him doing dub mixes for massive attack? theyre 
certainly not a reggae band, but wouldnt the dub mixes of their 
tracks by mad prof definitely be dub? 

>You can't line up a Lee Perry track next to Deep Dish's "dub mix" 
of "Like I Love You" and tell me
>that they're the same thing. They aren't. They may employ the 
same ideas and/or techniques, but they
>are two distinctly different styles of music.

thats absolutely true, but thats because dub isnt just a style of 
music. its a set of techniques, and music that can be called 
straight up dub can sound like a million things, and you can take 
that technique and apply to it other genres. im telling you, give 
a listen to basic channel. theyre unquestionably dub, but nothing 
else in dub at that point sounded like that. shit, if you check 
lee perry and mad professor's most recent productions, they have 
more in common with techno than they do with 70's dub music. 

>I agree...except for the inclusion of Dub.
>
>(And show some respect. Capitalize the D.)

the only "d" i capitalize is when i say "Deez nuts"

Do you know what's killing the scene?  People talking about how the "scene" is dying.  All of the talk about how great it was makes me wonder why no one talks about any of the false friendships, deception, and grief which acted as part of it as well. 
Many of the older generation will talk about how great the Kennedy years were, how Reagan era politics where better than what we have, and how everything was better "in the day."  Truth be told, things weren't necessarily better, people just seem to get nostalgic and place their memories on a higher plane than the present. 
Events used to be promoted better, produced better, and received higher attendance, but I would have to say, that is where the "better" part of it all ends.  If you want to think it was better before and try to regain that status, do something about it instead of blaming other people. 
I'm going to go "remember the great years" with a nice tall Guiness and the 92 Stanley Cup finals video.....wait, does drinking alcohol mean I'm helping ruin the scene?

"It's a great day for hockey"

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Flaming Lips Rave Related

Stuck in the perpetual motion
Dying against the machine
The whole thing leaves
You a nothing instead of a these
The sun is black and the black halos fly
And your number is backwards again when you try
The sound is so cute when you're 22
When you're 22

hmm, i'm gonna have to go buy these bad boys now. it's
been a while since i've even listened to the lips

Subject: {pb-cle} Magda @Shift ?

Is Magda spinning at tonight's Shift @Touch? I read it in Touch's listing in the Plain Dealer, but I haven't seen a flyer or anything on the ROM...

For those who don't know her she's a techno dj from New York City. I last saw her play with Richie Hawtin on a boat party in NYC; pretty sure I remember her using Final Scratch, too. (?)

Anyone with the scoop?

Aight, I'm just in from Santa Cruz(where we have an infant but very nice rave scene, which I'll no doubt speak of later). I'm currently living in Cedarville, near Xenia(West Ohio, unfortunately), but I hope to travel to future events you guys sponsor. 
All for now.

did she just move there?  i went to her house not too long ago and it was in
detroit.

she is using final scratch.  richie hired her to encode _all_ of his vinyl
and as a side bonus she got to make a copy of everything.  she has a fooking
arsenal of techno and house.

damn.

Damn is right! We had an awesome time tonight. Big ups to the Shift crew and Touch for hosting an awesome party. Magda added some unique flavor. 

I (wrongly) assumed she was living in New York since it seemed like she was playing a lot of local parties there [blush]...But it totally makes sense that she would reside in Detroit...I dunno...I totally forgot to ask her when I talked to her tonight. [shrugs shoulders]

Speaking of Detroit, what's the word on the "Detroit's gift to the world" exhibit? Time? Location? How was the event last Friday?

Look out for the Shift night in late April at Touch.  Experimedia / Headroom Digital and the Touch Crew are teaming up to bring an insane lineup of suave ass neo-disco and electro.  The jams!
Live sets by Bangkok Impact, Legowelt, Orgue Electronique, and Macho Cat Garage!
And if you even say "who?" I only have thing to say to you....Get out from underneath your rock and hunt down some of the best dance tunes being produced right now!
Your beloved Hawtin would agree...If you take a close look at his new mix CD with Sven Vath you will see Legowelt's "smash dancefloor hit" Disco Rout.  As well Sven Vath's Coccoon label just released a Legowelt Disco Rout remix 12" which is HOT AS HELL!  
Another record featureing mant of these artists and more on my own Molotov Records will be out and available mid february.  Samples available at http://molotov.experimedia.net
HOT!

Subject: {pb-cle} Tasha this Tuesday Jan. 28th @ Rebirth in Kent

Control the Night and Quantum Bass presents..
"REBIRTH"

Every Tuesday

Local and NATIONAL DnB acts

Best regional House, Trance and Techno acts

January 28th 2003

TASHA (Tribe Records UK, Planet Groove, Pound Records UK)
As one of the east coasts most dedicated dj's Tasha, together with his 
collective of equally minded djs/producers have developed a drum and bass 
scene and a thriving production community in his home state of Virginia. 
Being one of the founding fathers of the most prolific drum and bass crew in 
the area, and the resident dj for the now defunked f(x) productions, they 
accomplished in little over two years what was thought couldnt be done in 
the region. From creating legendary mid atlantic events such as the flash 
flood series, to the thursday night weekly "Flood," which featured resident 
dj Tasha alongside Co- residents Nigel Richards of 611 records and later 
Feelgood of moonshine records along with a spectrum of some of the worlds 
top djs.

Subject: {pb-cle} Abbasso last night...posted correctly (oops)

Thanks and props go to Chris Eberhart, DJ Lee, and
Andre Leon for providing us with some awesome music
last night...The dance floor was as crowded as I've
seen it since well before Christmas...It's nice to see
again.  Thanks as well to any and all who came out to
listen and enjoy despite the shitty weather - it's
nice to see more new faces on the floor.  

Thanks in particular to Chris for dropping Cowgirl -
it's nice to hear 'standards' once in a while
(especially after a half dozen cocktails), and that
one made my night.

Much Respect,
Jamie

Hey everyone, 

 

If you're bored, go ahead and tune into my live mix..as I've gotten the
'OK' to stream audio from selekta.com once again. I'll be throwing down
every Monday night from 9PM to 10PM.

 

Tonight is basically a test run, so tune in, sit back, relax, and enjoy
some breakbeats.

 

You can stream with Real Audio here:

http://www.selekta.com/djmoose.ram

 

Hit me up on Aim at djmoosecom or IQC at 57956052.

 

Thanks!

Moose

i wil NEVER buy another sound blaster product.

i've used them for years because of price, but i've gotten tired of the

Ever seen Gummo? Its set in Xenia, OH.

Twisted frigging movie too.

Seriously, some of these people are so screwed up that I find it very, very 
difficult to believe that they are all actors. Rent it.

I know you can get a copy at Incredibly Strange Video if you're from the 
'Burgh.

All,
  I am excited to announce the start of a new electronic music radio
show on 91.1 WRUW-FM Cleveland (the Case Western Reserve University
radio station).  The show is called The Beat Matrix and will feature new
electronic music releases as well as local guest DJ's.  You can catch
the show every Monday night from 10:30pm to 12:30am.  We will frequently
have giveaways such as cds, gift certificates for local scene related
stores, and tickets/guest list privileges to local events and venues.  
 
The station has broadcasting power of 15,000 watts which sends out
signal 25 miles to the North/South and 75 miles east and west.  This
gives the show a potential audience of the entire greater Cleveland area
(and to even further to Pennsylvania on clear nights).  The station also
has a live 24/7 web-stream which can be accessed from
(http://www.wruw.org <http://www.wruw.org/> ). The stream is limited at
the moment but will be fully functioning soon.  The show is a great
opportunity to expose the music and the scene to more people than ever!
 
Of course, the show can not be successful with out all of your support.
If you are a DJ or producer and are interested in being featured on the
show, please send us your demo.  If you own a local business, production
crew or venue, please help us by providing giveaways.  The more
diversity and quality in music we provide, along with the giveaways are
a huge incentive for people to tune in and listen every week.  Everyone
can benefit with your support; all it takes is for us to work together.
 
Check out our website at http://www.beatmatrix.net
<http://www.beatmatrix.net/> .  The site is still in the works but will
soon feature our guest schedule, show play lists, events listings etc.  
 
If have any questions please contact me at info@beatmatrix.net.  Thank
you all for your time.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} BSP: New Electronic Music Radio Show on 91.1 FM - Cleveland!

yeah I just happened to catch that on my way home from school.  
Except once I get near my house (streetsboro) there's some other 
station that starts leaking in, so couldn't listen to the rest of it 
(the stream wasn't working)

I agree. I got a pretty big kick out of seeing Casper being portrayed as a 
mafioso type. There were parts of Bully that just reeked of total b.s. that 
those punk ass bitches claimed at trial trying to save their own necks.

Never did see Julien Donkey Boy though. Sounds pretty interesting.

Actually Gummo is by Harmonie Corrine.  Harmony Corrine and Larry Clark did Kids together then they went their seperate ways.

Harmony Corrine ... http://www.angelfire.com/ab/harmonykorine/ .. has done...
Kids, Gummo, and Julein Donkey Boy.

Larry Clark... http://larryclarkofficialwebsite.com/ .....has done.....
Kids, Another Day In Paradise, Bully, Teenage Caveman, and his recent and still unreleased Ken Park is rumoured to be his most contreversial movie yet.

kids was probably the worst movie ive ever seen. it gave me the
impression that with any amount of hype, the worst film ever can
be successful. 

thank for for chloe sevigny and rosario dawson, without them that
couple hours would have been totally wasted.

i saw that as well. while i didnt like it exactly, i didnt hate
it. despite its numerous gaping plot holes, it was quite good at
building suspense, and that chick in it was pretty hot. i also saw
the japanese version, hoping that something was lost in the
translation, but no, it was also horrible. the only movie that can
compete with kids in my eyes is john leguizamo's "the pest" which
was bad enough that i left the theatre. usually, ill just fall
asleep like i did during the american godzilla movie with matthew
broderick.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} movies..was harmonie corrine/larry clark

i havent seen the ring yet, although some friends of
mine who are serious japanese film buffs said it was a
really good remake..

this past weekend i saw tom tyker's (run lola run,
princess and the warrior) "heaven" which was the last?
screenplay by Krzysztof Kieslowski (to be in a
trilogy: heaven, hell & purgatory)..it was great.

cate blanchett & giovanni ribisi are in it..cate
blanchett is so goddamn hot, especialy with shaved
head.. i would definitly reccomend this to
anyone..although the "love" aspect of it is a bit off
its still a good film..

im itching to see 25th hour..

Yeah, Xenia is smack dab in the middle of 'tornado alley'. Eh, if I'm lucky, I'll get a free trip to the land of Oz. Heh.

I'd like to see both of those... 25th Hour is bombing at the box office,
I wonder why. 
I just saw About Schmidt, very good! Still want to see Adaptation and
The Pianist.
Go see Gangs of New York if you haven't already... Daniel Day Lewis will
blow your mind. His performance has Best Actor award written all over
it! He really makes you appreciate good character acting!
I also dug Catch Me if You Can... amazing story!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} question for you pc gearheads

Depends on how much you want to spend.  $200 to $2000 and higher.  Its all
about your converters both in and out.  Do some research on the subject b4
you purchase.  www.google.com

Personaly, if I had to do it again I would go with a RME multiface.  But
thats like $1000 and most people don't want to spend that kind of money.

Das Label auf dem auch die letzte Figurine erschien kommt mit einem
neuen Album von Jean Bach, aka Sascha Schierloh, die sich wie immer auf
gar nichts festlegt. Mal skurrile Dancefloor Tracks mit zirpenden Sounds
und fast analoger Ästhetik die plötzlich in Popslammer mutieren,
dazwischen Bassdrum Terror veranstalten und den Gameboy rocken als wäre
immer 1990, Stücke die ein Retrodiscoflavour dazumischen, und sich
irgendwann in Effektoverload suhlen wie eine Fangopackung der
Erinnerung. 80er Cutupwahnsinn der merkwürdigsten Sorte neben Killer-DSP
Spezialitäten und all das immer in dieser eigenwilligen Mischung aus
Lofi-Losgeh-Terror und morbid überglücklichem Zitatuniversum mit ernsten
tragischen Passagen und Teilen die fast psychotisch wirken, mit
Stammtischgabba und Kinderzimmerneurosen, Drummachine Workouts und allem
was das elektronische Heimwerkerherz so begehrt. Nur eins ist es nie:
langweilig und festgefahren. Bilderbuch CD.

>I'd like to see both of those... 25th Hour is bombing at the box
office,
>I wonder why. 

because its not plot based. people cant handle movies like that,
they need a plot like theyre junkies or something. it is a
beautiful and very real movie. spike lee is the man. 

>Still want to see Adaptation and
>The Pianist.

adaptation was the best movie made last year, at least that i saw.
people have reccomended the brazilian film "city of god" to me,
and it looks fucking awesome, but its not coming anywhere near
pittsburgh. ill have to wait for the dvd. 

>Go see Gangs of New York if you haven't already... Daniel Day
Lewis will
>blow your mind. His performance has Best Actor award written all over
>it! He really makes you appreciate good character acting!

yeah, that flick was pretty fresh as well. DDL was fucking
phenomenal, if he doesnt win the oscar, its a fix. the best
supporting actor and actress better be from adaptation or its fixed. 

>I also dug Catch Me if You Can... amazing story!

i dont know about that shit, it looked a little fruity to me.

my delta 44 is pretty fresh, and its only $200. remember kids,
cheap shit makes fun music. early techno and jungle tunes were

awesome. write good melodies and rythyms and you dont have to

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} question for you pc gearheads

yeah, but for the final recording, its nice to have something to record 
it without fucking up the sound.

i've been hot on this
http://www.esi-pro.com/esi-pro/eng/product/wt192m/wt192m.html

don't know anyone that uses one though and don't know much about 
quality.  street price is 200$ though.

m-audio has one coming out, thats i think 4 ins, 8 outs and plugs into a 
firewire port.  looks cool, but i'm sure wayyyy more than i care to spend.

Have you collected your $20 payment from the major record labels &
retailers yet?
=20
They're forced to give $44 million back to consumers, but since most
people don't know about it yet, it's going mostly unclaimed.
=20
Read this article from the AP newswire:
http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,57111,00.html

 Then CLICK THIS LINK to file your claim:

 Cool, huh?
=20
 It seems only fair that musicians should get as much of this $44
 million as possible!  There's some kind of poetic justice here.
=20
 Forward this to your email list, band-mates, music fans, and any
 other musicians you know.

44 million is chump change.  they got off easy for decades of price 
fixing and gouging.
and as far as i can tell they are still doing it???

well the wired article says 143 million total, still chump change for 
those companies.

fuck, i should just fill it out with hundreds of fake names and see how 
much i can scam?

You act like you didn't have information leading up to the spam mail from 
this printing guy. You should have been provided with ample warnings from 
your operatives. He could have the 'thrax. He could have weapons of mass 
destruction.

Speaking of that, did you see the state of the union address yesterday?

What a fucking wank fest.

Dubya met with representatives from all the major media outlets prior to the 
address. Here's betting everything that the glaring inconsistancies are

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} question for you pc gearheads

I agree wholeheartedly w/ traaat here...

I've all but given up production until I can get my new PC built with a new, better soundcard and
Pro Tools Free running.

SB products are not made with music-making in mind, and thus, the DSP and sonic qualities are
horrid.

Every piece of music I play on them sounds like crap, and it's not just because I'm a shitty
songwriter!

but i really want a motu i/o24...it would be nice to send all the tracks in 
the sequencing software to a mixing desk and do mixdowns there...mouse 
mixing isnt for me...

dont give up mark...you'd be surprised what you can do with acid pro 
4.0...soft synth support and everything...it'll probably run decent on a p2 
300...it runs ok on my p2 400...they only time i have problems is when i 
have like 20 tracks and 8 busses going...sometimes acid hiccups...but other 
than that...im liking it...fruity loops works on just about everything as 
well...you can make your own loops in fruity...and track and mix them in 
acid...

the price of a mixing board and the motu in/out and the necessary
post production EFX is so small compared to the automated fader
box things that everyone from mackie to yo mama is making these
days. theyre generally USB and are automated with midi. it makes
no sense to not do it all in the computer now. especially
something like electronic music that uses little to no live band
type situations, you can get a small in/out and record 4 tracks at
a time and do it all in the computer, from the multitracking to
the mixdown to the post production to the CD burning. and its so
cheap. sooooooo cheap. you dont even really need the faderbox,
mouse mixing isnt so bad really, especially if you tweek your
mouse settings properly.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} question for you pc gearheads

If you are working completly in software think about getting a good set of
converters for output.  This way you will hear what is really going on.  I
think m-audio makes a usb to stereo 24bit 96khz converter.

work better when i have everthing at my fingertips and i dont need to go 
through menus to change settings...its also nice to be able to tweak out a 
real reverb or compressor...its also nice to be able to drive something and 
get a bit of warm saturation instead of getting a ton of digital 
distortion...oh yeah...nothing will ever beat the compressor/limiter on a

vestax 31 band....mmm 31 bands of vestax isolation...but then again its all

Subject: {pb-cle} detroit's gift to the world - wasRe: {pb-cle} Magda @Shift!!!!!

(sorry for the late response)

the event was really nice.  very swanky bar/club called 'the rooster tail'.
the sound downstairs was tight, but the sound upstairs was dick.  they had 4
small cabinets for a room that held over 1000 people.  mike huckaby was ok,
but boring.  stacey pullen was AWESOME despite some needle-issues.  james
pennington was ON FIRE.  god damn.  alan oldham went on after, but i really
wasn't in the mood for drumtracks (believe it or not).

the peeps that played downstairs all blew.  really.  there wasn't a lineup
posted anywhere so i'm not exactly sure who the first few acts were, but i'm
guessing d. wynn is one of them.  kelly hand and eddie "mix _what_?" fowlks
were a huge disappointment.

i think the best part was that half the people there were dressed up in
roaring-20's style suits.  some true jitterbug-looking shit.  i have some
pics if anybody wants to put them up on a page.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} question for you pc gearheads

DIY

ya'll better go back through your musical evolution and check
where your ethics come from. i mean if you want to use other
peoples shit and other studios, whatever. thats all up to you. but
even better is to do everything all by yourself. im telling you,
all the fancy gear in the world doesnt make a song good. you can
talk all kinds of trash on what your friend with the gear has, but
i know what people like venetian snares have used to put out a
good 2 dozen records in 2 years. he didnt use any of that shit,
and you can peep reviews of his records in every elite
experimental and electronic music magazine, he's toured the world
a bunch, records for such huge labels as mu-ziq and ant zen, has
been interviewed in magazines as big as playboy, and is generally
a fucking ill musician. his setup was a PC with a cheapish turtle
beach sound card, and a sony portable dat to record samples with.
it seems so obvious to me that creativity and good music rise so
far above studio equipment. like i said, go check what all the
innovators of electronic music were using, and youll see that it
was equipment that was considered junk because it is extremely
limited in what it can do. using an analogue drum machine in the
late 80s meant you could get clowned because of the leaps and
bounds in technology of sample based drum machines. and despite
all those leaps and bounds, why do you think that the 909 and 808
are still hugely popular? because theyre cheap, and they sound
good and you dont need a degree in sound engineering to use them.
argh.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} question for you pc gearheads

im a big believer in diy.  i dont even think i could get in the creative
mode at a big studio.  the only way i could do it is to write everything
before hand then bring my comp to the studio.  but by that point i would
have eveything sounding exactly the way i want, so why bother.

techno was most defintaley began with crap, but i wouldnt call the stuff
we use today crap.  i just sample crap.  a lot of times the comp makes
things too clean and you need to dirty it up.

i can think of so many examples of diy in dnb, a style thats known for
sound quality.

technical itch - reason/cubase
concord dawn - fruity loops (sound blaster live)
chris su and skg - reason alone
peshay - reason
bad company - most of the b-lines from the last album came from the
maelstrom in reason
paradox and aphrodite - still use amigas for chrissake

the list goes on and on, the point is you dont need much.  you dont even
need a new computer, reason runs great on my 500 meg lap top and fruity
will run on a pentium 2.

4d.

i say fuck the big studio, im happy with a pc and some decent moniters.

this is the attitude i love for sure. and might i point out that 
all the tracks ive heard from adam have been pretty fucking nice, 
good beats and not the typical drum and bass sound for sure. 

>techno was most defintaley began with crap, but i wouldnt call

compared to the old X0X boxes and the stuff those techno guys 
used, hell no its not crap. but compared to the big studios with 
all the new expensive gear in them, its still considerably less 
than that. i agree that its not crap standing alone, but 
comparatively is what i was talking about. 

>i just sample crap.  a lot of times the comp makes
>things too clean and you need to dirty it up.

thats whats up with buying the old analogues that are still cheap 
and using cheap old analogue efx before recording it digitally. 
you get the best of both worlds, the gritty sound and the cheap 
editing and multitracking. you cant beat it.

Subject: {pb-cle} massive attack listening party / keep it deep shirts

hey yous

i missed a bunch of mail while i was out of town - but i know some of you
were excited about the new massive attack coming out next week.  i'm
pre-ordering copies for milk which i'll get my hands on monday feb 10, for a
midnight listening party that night (officially feb 11).  email me if you'd
like a copy - i know the album is roaming around on the internet, but i'd
especially encourage people to purchase this too.  i'll be selling them at
my cost, so it's not about making that insane $3 profit ;)

[also, this will be the last function at the current milk records building
as we're moving in two weeks.  details coming on that.]

so...

#1 email me if you'd like me to reserve a copy of 100th window @ $12

#2 listening party 11pm-1:30am monday feb 10/tues feb 11 @ milk - 1601 penn
ave - entrance on 16th [actual store - not adam's event space]

#3 the 'keep it deep' shirts are still in line - give a couple more weeks
and they should be ready - email if you'd like one - specify s, m, l, xl,
girls t

all for now
kelly

Subject: {pb-cle} Action Alert! Biden Introduces New RAVE Act!!!

It only takes a few seconds to fax your senator! please do it! Let 
them know we won't stand for the destruction of our freedoms! This 
kind of misguided legislation is just one example of how the so 
called "War on Drugs" has turned our country into a virtual police 
state.


 From The Drug Policy Alliance:
------------------------------------------
*** Biden Introduces New RAVE Act!!!
*** Your Help Urgently Needed

Several weeks ago we warned you that last year's RAVE Act was
incorporated into Sen. Daschle's domestic security bill (S. 22). It
gets worse. Senators Biden (D-DE), Grassley (R-IA), Feinstein (D-CA),
and Lieberman (D-CT) have introduced it as a stand-alone bill (S.
226 - which is not posted on thomas.loc.gov yet. We'll link from our
site,  http://www.drugpolicy.org , once it becomes available). It's
not called the RAVE Act. Nor does it have a findings section talking
about raves or electronic music. It's now called the Illicit Drug
Anti-Proliferation Act. DON'T BE FOOLED! It's the RAVE Act in new
clothing. If enacted, it would harm innocent business owners,
undermine public safety, and stifle free speech and musical
expression.

Your help is needed to stop this disguised RAVE Act from becoming
law!!!

*** Fax your two Senators. Tell them to oppose S. 226 the Illicit
     Drug Anti-Proliferation Act. You can use our convenient system:
     http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/

     Or find your Senators's fax number at:
     http://www.senate.gov

*** Please forward this action alert to your friends and family. The
     Senate needs to know that voters find this bill unacceptable.

For more information on the RAVE Act and S. 226 see:
http://www.nomoredrugwar.org/music/rave_act.htm

Please consider making a donation to help the Drug Policy Alliance
continue to fight for our rights: http://www.drugpolicy.org/join

We need your support to stop this bill!
---------------------------------------------------

Once again, we all have to get together and make our voice heard!


Regards,

Andy Somers

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Feb 01                           TRU                           Columbus

After much consideration I have decided to move all Rise events from Red 
Zone to 382 West Nationwide Blvd. known as Mekka, The Music Factory, The 
Factory, and the former Glow. 
To avoid legal complications I am switching the Rise name to Tru. All 
further events will be billed as Tru at the Factory. With the new space 
the level of production will be unlike anything before done in Columbus. 
The sound system is the same EAW line array system that most major touring 
acts bring with them for Arena shows. All lighting, laser, and visuals 
will be completely installed and programmed in time for Feb. 1. We have 
many plans to take the experience to the next level. You will be both 
pleased and hopefully amazed at what we plan to do. The talent lineup is 
among the top in the World. The first Tru event is Saturday Feb. 1st. 
To those of you who have been to Mekka in the last 6 weeks a few things.

1) The sound, what is currently in the venue is on loan from EAW. The far 
superior Line Array system was custom built for the room, and arrives and 
is installed the second week of January. It will amaze you with its 
clarity, and power.

2) Lights, 4 Mac 2000's have been on back order and arrive mid January, 
the current light show is less than 1/2 of what it will be.

3) Laser, It has not been programmed, or ulitized to 20% of its capability 
yet, Feb. 1, be prepared!!

4)Stage, headlining talent will be featured on stage, with full 
production. You will understand Feb. 1

5) visuals, Feb. 1

I ask for you support in this change, I feel that it is a positive 
evolution for the scene. I intend to surpass the quality level that has 
made Rise so successful.

Saturday, Feb. 1 The Premier of Tru at the Factory.

Talent:

BT (Exclusive DJ set)

Sat Feb 01                   WISHING ON A STAR 3                     Dayton

Wishing Well & GrooveFuel LLC present
Wishing on a Star 3: Wishing Well 2 Year Anniversary
Dayton, OH - February 1, 2003

_hosted all night by Mc Jumper

_featuring the follow up to the Get Down tour, "The Feel The Rhythm Tour" 
with Paul Johnson and Translucent

_Paul_Johnson_(Dusttraxx)_Chicago
Paul has not let the wheelchair he is confined to slow him down in the 
studio or behind the decks. "Get Down", one of the hottest house tunes 
ever produced was played by everyone and their momma's. He will be 
releasing the follow up track, "Feel the Rhythm" on this awesome night so 
listen for it and be able to say "I was at the event where that track was 
released."

_Translucent_(Transparent, Dusttraxx)_Chicago
This very talented musician lays down the dopest house cuts and is a house 
legend in many eyes. Just wait til' he pulls out the trumpet and blows you 
away with the soul.

_Teebee_(Metalheadz, Subtitles, Certificate 18 )_Norway
DJ/producer Teebee spent ten years making his mark on the Norwegian drum 
'n' bass scene, but it only took one album and a handful of singles (on 
labels like Rugged Vinyl and Moving Shadow) to establish him as a major 
player in the elitist UK drum 'n' bass scene. Teebee now needs no 
introduction. He's become one of the major successes of the UK's 
forward-thinking Certificate 18 label, as well as winning the "Best 
International Producer" award from Knowledge Magazine in 2001. He's had 
releases on numerous labels, including Prototype, Juice, Creative Source, 
Moving Shadow, and many more, as well as releasing several mysteriously 
haunting R&B-flavored drum 'n' bass bootlegs. Additionally, he plays DJ 
gigs around the world, creating a stir with head-banging sets that run the 
gamut between dark and melodic sounds. More so than most DJs, he really 
gets involved in his sets, dancing about, pumping his fists, and 
transmitting an intense energy to the crowd.

_Venom_(Volume Prod.)_New Jersey
I have an idea that he is going to break out the live p.a. for this show 
and if you haven't seen it you are about to be amazed. This guy is so 
talented it isn't funny. Just wait as the dnb fused live show rocks you 
off your feet.

_The_Untouchables_-_Flagrant,_Sterling_+_Chango-Fatt_(Mustard 
Records-Australia)
Dopest hip hop duo with mc coming staight from the down under with mad 
Australian clothing giveaways. Flagrant and Sterling tore it up at Wishing 
2 now they are back to burn the tables down.

_Jen_Lasher_(Object Oriented Bliss, GrooveFuel AM)_www.groovefuel.com
A member of the Object-Oriented Bliss DJ collective and recently signed to 
GrooveFuel AM, Jen Lasher has come into her own as one of America's 
Breakbeat up and comers. Her smooth mixing skills and taste in phat beats 
have recently gained the attention of ReleaseArtistManagement, an 
international DJ roster as well as independent record label that works 
with many of the worlds top producers and DJs including Jackal & Hyde, 
Hyper, & Rick West.

Jen is no stranger to music production, not only is she contributing 
vocals to the next DJ Icey artist compilation, she's also working with 
Icey on a new track to be released in 2003. To top it all off, Jen keeps 
her style original and unique by incorporating her own tracks and vocals 
into DJ sets. In addition to her national tour dates, you can catch her at 
her residency in Baltimore, MD at Ultraworld's, Sonar Lounge. You don't 
want to miss Jen dropping her dope beats at Wishing on a Star 3.

_Nautigroove_(In The Groove)_Cincinnati
The man behind In The Groove and a soon to be family member, Jason lays 
down whatever it takes to make the crowd melt in his hands. If you have a 
love for music the way we do you do not want to miss this set so be ready 
to be taken into a state of pure bliss by the sounds of this expert.

_Sparky_Killabrew_(Wishing Well, Well Known)_KY
Sparky is coming to us off his last show opening for Nappy Roots and 
10,000 raging people. His turntablist tricks and beat juggling combined 
with his dope underground hip hop track selection, you better not miss it. 
He made his debut at the first Wishing and is now back to rock the joint.

_Rob_Riddum_(GF Music Factory)_Cleveland
Rob Riddum is one of the most well known and dedicated dnb djs in the Ohio 
scene today. The legacy began in 1996 as Riddum took his funky set to the 
streets as member of the popular Elements Squad. Now after producing 
tracks for Jackass and making a strong surge in the last year Rob is 
taking it to the next level.

_Dank_One_(Better Days, Alkaline Sound)Louisville
The man behind A*S*S, the sound system that will be rocking rooms in 
Dayton from now on, Kevin will be laying many drum and bass tracks of his 
and many other producers, that are on the cutting edge of the dnb genre.

_Lil'_Cory_(NateFx)_Lexington, KY
Cory has been itching to hit Ohio on the house tip so let's rock. He will 
be hitting us hard with a dope booty house set that is guaranteed not to 
disappoint anyone. Get ready to "Hit it From the Back".

_Matt_Freeman_(Flashpoint, Illuminators)_Dayton
Matt has been rocking the decks long enough to know, that he rocks the 
decks. Making his 3rd straight Wishing On A Star appearance make some 
noise for the man who never disappoints.

_Nimby_(American Cheese)_Cincinnati_w/_Mc Jumper_(Neutral Music, 
RPC)_Rochester
This is the first time these happy hardcore gurus will perform together so 
be sure not to miss this set. Nimby has been setting the standard for 
hardcore in Ohio for the past couple of years and is now ready to "Rise to 
the Top" like a "Shooting Star" as he throws down an oldskool anthem set.

_Dorian_(4-Score, Inneraction, Vinyl Beats)_Nashville, Tennessee
A staple in the Nashville DnB scene since 1997, Dorian's mixing and 
scratching technique will leave you in awe. We're not one to gossip, but 
word has it, he is a master at toe scratching.

_Centrex_(Unified Ent, Breakline Crew)_Cincinnati
His mixing is flawless and the track selection will make your body butta 
from dancin'. Letting people know that breaks is on the rise, Tom is one 
part of the infamous Breakline Crew consisting of Cyberspeed, Clay-Born, 
Kitsonik, Bobby Bedlam, APX, Breakthrough, and Annalyze.

_Clay-Born_(Wishing Well, Breakline Crew)_Louisville
He might play alot of Wishing Well/Groovefuel events but he never fails to 
rock it and is our little buddy who we rescued from the sounds of hard 
house a couple of years ago. That's right if you were at Shamrock in 
Columbus you saw him rip some Uk Hard House, but that is all in the past.

_Foursqare_(Wishing Well, Hushabye House)_Louisville
Marea has taken her love for house music to a whole new level. Now one of 
the best house djs our area has to offer, she has created a following of 
househeads, partykids, and just plain music enthusiasts that just can't 
help but shake their booties to the sounds of "The Lady".

_Subnet_(GF Music Factory)_Cincinnati
Music Factory introduces Subnet... Rooted in progressive styles of house 
and trance, the signature Subnet sound has evolved to a banging techno 
that is nothing short of cutting edge. Impressive to even the most savvy 
ear, his sound is grounded in fresh, energetic track selection and 
seamless mixing. Everyone come check Matt out at his first Wishing Well / 
GrooveFuel performance.

_Anita_DeCastro_(Scarab Records)_Indianapolis
This young funky breaks master is making her way into what is soon to be a 
great breaks scene here in the Midwest. At the young age of 18, the future 
is looking very bright and from here the sky is the limit.

_Def_Leper_(Wishing Well, Ravetrash Kids)
If you have yet to see this crazy lunatic rip your intestines out and sing 
to them, you need to be main stage at when the music starts to hear him. 
Let's just say if you are under 18 hold your ears, haha.
More info to come this week... Wishing Well and GrooveFuel rockin' it.

the electronic dance scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. 
"Once I started getting into producing dance music, 
I finally felt I was on the right track to where I wanted to be musically. 
My reputation as a cutting edge producer, and later as a DJ, steadily

The closest Paul has come to Ohio has been Chicago. It speaks volumes for 
our scene that he would come to play. If you look at his past gigs you 
will see that Columbus is by far the smallest city in North America that 
Paul has ever played. Thank you for helping me make this possible.

Now with that being said. This event is being promoted throughout the 
entire midwest. Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania & Ohio. I higly 
recommend getting your presale tickets NOW because there is the strong 
possibility of this event selling out. We are talking with both 
Ticketmaster and ticketweb and we will have them online with one of the 
services by the end of this week.
Presales start at only $25.

GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well present
One Love
Northeast, OH - February 22, 2003

The production tandem of GrooveFuel LLC & Wishing Well trek north with 
some of the best djs from Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, 
Tennessee, New York, Florida, California and many other states 
representing. This is an event for everyone to look, especially in Ohio 
and see how much of a great scene we are and what we can produce if we 
cooperate. We have selected many dj's and have gotten full support from 
surrounding crews to bring you the following crowd rockers:

_Dj Rap_(Proper Talent)_L.A.
Being simultaneously a label owner, producer, recording artist, live 
performer and world-renowned DJ, East Londonís Charissa Saverio, aka DJ 
Rap is a unique force in electronic music and stands alongside the likes 
of DJs Hype, Grooverider and LTJ Bukem as one of the few, and only female, 
pioneers of drum and bass. This year she celebrates the first ten years of 
her career in dance music, and the re launch of her imprint Proper Talent, 
with the release of the mix compilation 'Propa Classics Vol 1' (via 
Intuit-Solar). The album features two exclusive new tracks and thirteen of 
the best and rarest dance-floor anthems that forged her reputation as the 
"first lady of jungle". Rap is deep into the process of writing and 
producing a new album for Sony due for release in 2003.

_Charles Feelgood_(Buzz DC, Moonshine Records)_L.A.
Feelgood put the Baltimore and Washington DC rave scene on the map. Back 
in 1990, with his then partner Scott Henry, Feelgood co-produced and 
launched his now legendary hometown club Fever, introducing Baltimore/DC 
to featured DJs including Sven Vath, Dave Clark and Derrick Carter. As 
quoted in the September, 2000 issue of Urb, "Fever went on to form the 
cornerstone of the Baltimore/DC rave scene." To this day, Feelgood remains 
one of the most beloved DJs in the country. From Coast to Coast and from 
week to week he can be seen spinning at landmark clubs such as Twilo, 
Shampoo and Spundae, not to mention his wild popularity overseas. With 
Feelgood's vibrant personality and banging peak hour house sets only one 
question remains - Can You Feel It?

20KFreaks and GrooveFuel AM present

FIRST NORTHERN OHIO APPEARANCE!
_Jackal's_Digital_Mix_( Hallucination Recordings / GrooveFuel AM )_Miami, 
FL

Icey and Baby Anne have brought his tracks to Ohio countless times but, 
the hour is finally near for Ohio to welcome the true prognosticator of 
Florida breakbeat and mayhem, Jackal. Best known for his involvement in 
the electro-core tandem of Jackal & Hyde, producer/performer Scott Weiser 
is nothing short of a living legend in electronic music. His most recent 
contribution to breakbeat and house heads across the world: Jackal 
Digital Mix Set - an hour of energy and controlled techno mayhem from the 
mind of a master madman. Off the chain would be an understatement. Tie 
your roofs down and hide your kids because Jackal is coming to town.

Scott Weiser (Jackal) needs no introduction, both of his groups Jackal & 
Hyde and DynamixII are World renowned and in constant demand on turntables 
from Los Angeles to Berlin. -URB MAGAZINE

_FACTORe_( 20KFreaks / GrooveFuel AM )_Birmingham, AL

The staple of the 20kFreaks label, FACTORe is one of the most talented and 
respected breatbeat DJs and producers in the industry. Behind the decks 
since the early 80s, he's been ripping it since most of you were in 
diapers. When FACTORe throws down his pounding breakbeat, there won't be 
an ass that isn't shakin'. Come experience the past, present, and future 
of breakbeat as FACTORe brings his signature style and class on the CUT N 
DROP Tour. The tour was first named the "All The Tracks We Produced That 
You Thought Were Icey's" Tour, but, turned out that CUT N DROP was a lot 
shorter and fit on the record.

BACK TO THE BASICS 3
March 1st, 2003
Southwest, Ohio

It's been over 4.5 years now, and we're still going strong. We've thrown 
massives, club events, intimate events, and we keep coming back for more! 
On this night, we will revive the series that started it all - BACK TO THE 
BASICS! This event is exactly that - a return to the old school. We've 
secured an intimate 1 room venue, an awesome sound system, a killer lineup 
and the kind of old school atmosphere and decorations that got a lot of us 
into the scene long ago. We will be giving away hundreds of copies of 
D8A's newest CD, and we will be powering our evening's visuals with 
another laser to blow you away.

club night in CT. Knowledge has produced material released on K:cid and is

progressive blend of Breaks, House, 2Step and Trance. She is known for 
both her energetic and sassy presence behind the decks and her ability to 
throw down and almost any style of music flawlessly. There is never a dull 
moment when she performs and she likes to keep the crowd on their toes by 
layering different musical genres. This flexibility is also shown through

compilations, her latest being Hearthouse II.

D8A: SPECIAL OLD SCHOOL ACID HOUSE SET - www.groovereactor.com, Buckwyld - 
Dayton, OH - Over time, D8A has developed a unique style that always 
pleases. Ranging from the hardest hitting house and on into harder German 
techno/ trance, you can always expect to see the crowd dancing during his 
sets. Tonight though, D8A is preparing a special treat NOT TO BE MISSED. 
He will be dropping an ultra-rare acid house set with some of those 
long-ago heard gems and recent underground acid tracks that will truly 
take you BACK TO THE BASICS. If you were around in the glory days of acid

house sounds will surely keep everyone begging for more.

Toledo, OH - Matt will be bringing some down the hard techno sounds from 
Toledo and will be drawing on the Detroit influences who have made the

Well I'm moving to Washington D.C. tomorrow and I will be playing out one
last time in akron (unless somebody flies me in)  I will be at 328 South
Main st.
Akron, Oh tonight.  I play around 12 -12:30ish.  If you can make it cool if
not thats cool too.  I will still stay on the list so this isn't like a
goodbye (although I'm sure a few of you wish it was :p )

Hey Trout! Gig is free, and it's just the residents playing that night. There's no cover before 10:30pm, so there's no guestlist.

Today is the last day for you to grab a 100 minute set of Judge Jules.

http://www.djbradanderson.com/mixes.php

There is also a set for Basement Jaxx listed.   This is to help use up some 
bandwidth at my server for the month.   As i have a set amount and there is 
still some left, I just thought you'd all like to have some cool choons.

Any suggestions for next month?
Brad

Hey Trout! Gig is free, and it's just the residents playing that night. There's no cover before 10:30pm, so there's no guestlist.

Cheers!

Subject: {pb-cle} Abbasso Sat 1 Feb.

Dan Petrov (Techno and Tech-house) and
Thomar (Progressive House) 
will be spinning at Abbasso this Saturday from ~10pm
until ~5am.  It's been a while since I've heard Dan
play but from what I remember his sets are relatively
dark and minimalist, and his mixing and track
selection is top-notch, so it should be an interesting
evening from a musical perspective.

As always, Abbasso strives to create a laid-back,
friendly atmosphere and provide our patrons with some
of the best local talent that Cleveland has to
offer...and our bartenders make some of the strongest
drinks in town - just ask about a 'tall paul'.

Anyone remember Robert from Lovebomb?   Well I told him I would forward this

Hello All,

    As most of you know I am coming back to Cleveland On February 12th -
February 17th.   Due to unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances my two cats
are living by themselves in my condo.  They are being taken care of by my
mother, however I think that it is cruel to leave them there any longer.  I
need to find them a home, preferably together.  Also unfortunate is that I
cannot bring them to California.  The are brother and sister from the same
litter this is why I would like to keep them together. They are long haired,
the male is neutered, and they both still have their claws.  They are
roughly 6 years old and extremely affectionate.  I have made a decision that
I really don't want to make.  I have decided that I will have to take them
to a shelter if I cannot find them a home by the time I make it back to
Cleveland. If anyone can help it would be wonderful. Even if you know of
someone that might be interested. I would much appreciate it.


   Robert

There is also a set for Basement Jaxx listed. This is to help use up some 
bandwidth at my server for the month. As i have a set amount and there is 
still some left, I just thought you'd all like to have some cool choons.

Any suggestions for next month?

hahaha, that'd be awesome.

at white trash wrestling II, everyone was passed out and i didn't feel 
like sleeping, so i pulled out the 2 drop bass records i bought up there 
and spun them, then found a box of 80s cheese metal and spun them for 
like 2 hours until the PBS pussies woke up.   there was some other dood 
that was still around and jumping around the barn for a little bit then 
gave up.
ahhhh, naked etards wrestling.  and that crazy guy with the metal chair. 
  WWF styleeee boyeeee!

Thanks Tom ... and everyone else who came out last night ... it doesn't get 
any better than last night ... I'm so looking forward to the next few months 
- great DJs, great music, great friends - opening up the back patio.  We'll 
be celebrating our 3 year anniversary in March - hard to believe we are 
going into our 4th year with Thursday nights ... Also, D-Cypol in Seattle 
just called me yesterday and says he'll be stopping through town in April 
and wants to play.

In case people don't know, our 'special guest' from last night will be 
playing at 1814 tonight and tomorrow and also at Pub IG on Sunday eve.  See 
you there.

It's going to be a nice Spring.

Jason C.

shit, i befuddled the havana crowd last time i played by ending
with a mostly ambient but still electronic as all hell track "a
wonderful life (epic mix)" by carl craig. heads didnt even know
how to respond to that and its still essentially a techno song.
the end of sets is the best time to play something that doesnt
actually mix in. that freddies dead track was the ill shit. i
ended my steel city jungle performance back in 98 with "tainted
love" by soft cell. then like a week later i saw sine (SCJ
resident) spinning at a techno night, and he was up in the booth
mixing when he saw me. then at the end of his set he got on the
mic and dedicated the last track to me (which was moderately
embarrasing) but it was "unbelieveable" by EMF. thats the shit i
like to hear. the next time i spin anywhere, im playing the
"justified and the ancient" by the KLF featuring tammy wynette.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tonight at havana

I have been to Havana a number of times and always have had a lot of fun. I 
was terribly disapointed with the behavior of some of the staff last night 
however. Specifically it was the tall, dark-haired bartender. I don't know 
if he is the one that posts to this list or not, but I think that what 
happened there needs to be mentioned in a public forum.

Everyone there knows that the drinks are not cheap, but they are priced 
consistantly when I order them. A friend of mine, who doesn't necessarily 
have the stereotypical appearance of your average "scene-hipster" was shit 
all over. This guy charged her $20 for two Beam and Cokes and a Bombay and 
Tonic. I stepped in to confront him about this totally inflated cost and he 
tried to tell me the call drinks were $6 each and the Bombay was $7, and 
that he might owe us a dollar. That is totally ludicrous and in no way at 
all possible.

I asked his manager about the pricing in front of this bartender. He 
stumbled over the cost until the bartender told him what we were charged. 
The manager then nods his head and acts as if that's the rate. Obviously, I 
pointed in his face and called bullshit, after which time we were given back 
$10 in order to keep us from causing trouble.

My friend might not look like the people that this snobby, pompous ass likes 
to cater to, but that is no reason to take advantage of her. I think that 
these two people did a great disservice to what it is they claim to 
represent. I think that these people are just as bad as the people they 
claim to hate. I think that it is behavior like this that makes us all look 
bad as a whole.

I suspect that the proprieter of that establishment could not care any less 
whether I frequent his bar or not. I will say that I am greatly saddened by 
the fact that these people snicker to themselves about taking advantage of 
the people they don't think are *cool*.

My friend has more integrity, honor, and caring compassion than these two 
"gentlemen" could ever fathom. They chose to prejudge based on her 
appearance however. They're no better than the mainstream racist 
knuckleheads in the rest of society. The less-enlighted, unwashed yinzer 
massive that they're attempting to segregate themselves from.

It makes me sick when people loudly claim to have qualities, such as respect 
for others, but do things like this. Life is in the details of how you live 
it, not in the rhetoric that you hurl around.

Thanks Tom ... and everyone else who came out last night ... it doesn't get 
any better than last night ... I'm so looking forward to the next few months 
- great DJs, great music, great friends - opening up the back patio.  We'll 
be celebrating our 3 year anniversary in March - hard to believe we are 
going into our 4th year with Thursday nights ... Also, D-Cypol in Seattle 
just called me yesterday and says he'll be stopping through town in April 
and wants to play.

In case people don't know, our 'special guest' from last night will be 
playing at 1814 tonight and tomorrow and also at Pub IG on Sunday eve.  See 
you there.

It's going to be a nice Spring.

well, ive never had a problem with this. when you specify the kind
of liquor you want in your drink instead of the generic stuff bars
serve, it costs more. i dont know, cause i always expect to pay
through the nose when ordering crazy drinks (like those fucking
things dori drinks, i dont even know what the fuck is in those
things) but ive never found their prices to be outlandish.
obviously, theyre not dirt cheap, but rent on ellsworth ave is no
joke. their prices on guiness and the mixed drinks i buy have

i dont know who the manager was, but with drink specials that
change every day and even different times throughout a given
night, im sure its difficult for anyone who's not a bartender
there to be able to rattle off the prices of any given drink at
any given moment.

i dont know what your friend looks or dresses like, but i
certainly dont fit in with the general yuppie hipster thing that
goes on fashionwise up inside havana, and ive never had any
problems with anyone because of it. i usually try to sport at
least a collared shirt so i dont look too grungy, but last night i
was rolling in the tribal t-shirt, jeans, and doc martens with
some bed/hat head in effect. my friends who were there also didnt
dress in the hipster fashion. i would certainly not ever accuse
havana of discrimination based on dress. 

>It makes me sick when people loudly claim to have qualities, such

aside from the rest of your argument, no where does havana have a
sign posted saying "we respect every single person who enters this
establishment" so to assume that they would is erroneous on your end.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tonight at havana

I'm just going to take a second to step in here, mostly because I am an 
employee of Havana and think that your assumptions are a little off.  
The guy you are talking about is a barback, not a bartender, and I'm 
sure he helps with drinks when it is busy like that.  He would gain 
nothing from overcharging your friend, and he was not too far off with 
the prices [The call drinks being $5 each and the Bombay being $6 = 
$16].  Drinks are expensive at nice places for a reason = You're paying 
for an environment that was not cheap to create or maintain.  As far as 
assumptions about appearance I guess that is your personal opinion but 
no one I know would intentionally overcharge someone because of the way 
they looked, that's rediculous.  You were upset about a situation and 
apparently the manager did remedy it by returning $10 right?  That was 
more than the $3 you were [i'm sure] accidently overcharged.

At any rate, I think Havana has a great staff who definately deal with 
more than enough bullshit every night.  If you feel you were served 
that much of an "injustice" based on supposed appearance, make a 
statement and don't come back [My personal belief, separate from the 
establishment].  But if you want somewhere awesome to go out on a 
Thursday night and listen to great music, you won't find anywhere that 
matches Havana.

That's all I have to say about that,
linzee.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tonight at havana

my drinks are not crazy. i just have good taste :P

and i have to say i agree with you tom, that when you order a drink with a
liquor by name (stoli/cran as opposed to vodka/cran), you better expect to
pay for it. that's just how it works.

and also, i think the crowd at havana is pretty diverse on thursday
nights, as it used to be on tuesdays as well (don't go out too much on
weeknights anymore, so not sure what nights still go on). i have never
been treated poorly by the staff at havana, since way before i knew any of
them. i have been there dressed up and dressed down, and i have had
friends there the same way, and i have never heard of an issue with anyone
who works there.

i would just try to keep in mind that the staff is just doing their job,
and they don't make up the prices, they just do what they are told. and
they do have different specials every night, and maybe this person was
new?

i would really like to know their name... just out of curiousty, but i
really doubt they were being discriminatory. i am sure it was just a
misunderstanding, if not just the price they charge for name brand liquor.

You're making a very valid point Tom. My thinking has a tendency to be 
idealistic at times. Here is a good case in point that I may have ass-u-med 
too much. I found it disappointing, but I am realizing its because I know 
her.

Additionally, the music was fantastic last night. I neglected to mention 
that part. Overall it was a great time and what I took exception to was a 
very minor issue in the bigger picture.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} tonight at havana

<<He would gain nothing from overcharging your friend, and he was not too far off with the prices>>

I'm not saying this did or didn't happen. I wasn't there. BUT....with all due respect, Linzee, being
"off" at all is unacceptable.

If you walk into any restaurant and order a sandwich, and they're "off" as you say, by 2 or 3
dollars, that's a problem. The guy at the register at the supermarket can't be "off" by 1 or 2
dollars when he sells you your bar of soap.

Even by inflating one drink price by $1, the bartender in question stands to make a gain---One
dollar that the bar isn't charging that he can put in his pocket and no one's the wiser.

I'm not suggesting that he did this, but the possibility DOES exist, because I've done it.

Over the course of a night, you can easily make an extra $20 with no one noticing a thing except the
patrons of the bar POSSIBLY noticing the prices of the drinks....and if he's a bar-back "fillnig in"
in during the pinch of the peak hour(s), all the more reason why...he doesn't make the tips that the
regular bartenders make, and so much shit is going on at once, that few, if any, will notice.

this happens quite frequently in every restaurant, bar, and

this is of course a distinct possibility, though from the
experiences ive had and the experiences all the people i know have
had, i dont think that is what goes on at havana. i could be
wrong, but i seriously doubt it.

obviously, everyone wants to be treated fairly when they enter an
establishment. of course, this means that some people so take
advantage of this fact and are assholes to the staff at bars and
restaurants. so it does get on your nerves when people short
change you, walk out on a tab, stiff you on a tip etc. all im
saying is that the respect that would be most ideal is DEFINITELY
not practiced by the patrons of any given establishment. im not
saying in any way that you werent respectful of the bartender in
question, im just pointing out that it is a 2 way street in the
service industry.

mention

thats what im saying man. even if the drink prices WERE that high
all the time, the fact that you get a packed bar with hot music
and a nice diverse crowd with NO cover charge at all in a nice
looking bar in a nice neighborhood, i dont think it would be THAT
unreasonable. my only suggestion to you is that you dont give up
on the best night out in the city for dance music, and im sure you
wont see any repeat performances of any overcharging.

see, i honestly dont get that either.  i mean the reason your there behind
the decks is because you can blend music together.  anyone can drop some
random track after their set, that takes no skill.  it is possible however
to mix a record that wasnt done on a drum machine, most of the old disco,
hip hop and reggae was either live instruments or live instruments looped
on a r2r.  i used to have this danny the wildchild tape from like 96 where
he mixed in "la di da di", thats the kind of shit that impresses me.

wrong. the reason im behind the deck is because i know more shit
and have more records than 99.9% of the people out there. the
whole mixing thing is vastly overrated and i dont think we need to
have this discussion on here again already, its only been like
what 2 weeks? 

>anyone can drop some
>random track after their set, that takes no skill. 

ah, sure. if you consider a song that keeps up the flow of your
set but isnt beat mixable to be a random song.

old disco,

im not saying it isnt possible, i mix in live drummed records in
the disco funk and dub genres with great frequency. what youre not
understanding is that BPM matching shit is often times impossible.
you go ahead and try to mix a 90 BPM funk track into a 130 BPM
house track and let me know how it goes. it wont work no matter
how you try. so even though the song stylistically fits what youre
playing, you shouldnt play it because it cant be beat mixed? thats
just silly. all those people you referred to in the hiphop reggae
and disco eras didnt rely on only beatmixing, but thats what
modern day electronic music is all about. go check that book "last
night a deejay saved my life" for an insane amount of info on
deejaying. the idea of a beatmix being the only method of playing
a record is recent, and stupid.

Two years ago I ended a chicago hard house set with a breakbeat record that
dropped in bpm from 135 down to 120, so I could finish up with "Centerfold"
by J. Geils Band.

At CDG3, assuming I play, I'm bringing my Parliament.

I dunno man, I really liked that Carl Craig tune.

I wasn't about to jump up and dance on teh bar to ambient though.

I had originally thought it was the first tune of Mike's set, but alas, it 
was the laat tune of yours.

I liked it alot though, regardless.

welcome to 2003, it doesnt matter how many records you have anymore.  only
half of my set consist of records these days.  there are other ways to
play music.

i wasn't on the list 2 weeks ago so sue me.

but as so many people have said, when you play a non-dance track and dont
mix it in, the dance floor gets evacuated.  thats not good for your
"flow".


> the idea of a beatmix being the only method of playing
> a record is recent, and stupid.

i never said thats the only way to play a record but it is the only way I
will play a record.  i guess im stupid but people seem to like it that
way.

hey, if you say so ace. you can play your final scratch, your
CD's, your original tracks, whatever. ill take my record
collection against anything you want to bring to the table as far
as track selection goes. 

>i wasn't on the list 2 weeks ago so sue me.

im pretty sure you were on around the time of the discussion, but
thats beside the point. 

>but as so many people have said, when you play a non-dance track

whoa whoa whoa. who says its not a "dance" track? its only not a
"dance" track if dance to you means 130 BPM drum machine music. my
point is that people cant connect music together in any abstracted
sense, they only care about beatmatched mixes, even if the songs
are boring as fuck, which mostly they are. this is a bad thing. 

>i never said thats the only way to play a record but it is the
only way I

fuck the way people like it. that shit is only very recent, a
product of the "dj mix compilation" in which deejays digitally
edit their mixes to be "flawless" and boring. go check your
history, larry levan often didnt beat mix, most dub/dancehall
deejays didnt/dont beat mix all the time, etc. shit, the man kool
herc who invented hiphop as we know it didnt fucking beatmix. why
should a dance deejay now have to beat mix? its the stupidest
fucking way to show a continuity between records, all it means is
that theyre the same BPM.

Subject: {pb-cle} html help

hey, i'm trying to put a link to an mp3 file in a web page, but it 
doesn't seem to work in AOL's web browser, I don't care what the file 
does, whether it opens in winamp, plays in AOL's media player, or 
downloads to disk, I just don't want it giving me an error or sitting 
there doing nothing at all. it works fine in my OSX version of mozilla, 
but in IE 5.0 it just seems to do nothing and in AOL it does nothing either.

any ideas?

Maybe people have more important things to worry about now rather than
supporting the rave scene. People are growing up, getting educated and 
looking to find a good job. Its not the 90's anymore man.

alone.  not even counting your train wrecks.

yeah, they can just minimize AOHell and use IE.  But since its not 
working in IE either.... 

Should just be able to do a normal link if you don't care what it 
does (there are ways of setting mime types and stuff, if you wanted 
to get technical).  Something like this should work (if you view mail 
as html, be sure to switch or else your not going to see it)

<a href="http://www.example.com/music/myhit.mp3">Da Bomb</a>

You have an example? maybe there's something wrong with your config 
or something.
