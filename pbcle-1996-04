Best DJ??????? What kinda Superbowl shit is this? Its bad enough that we 
have vain sellout DJs like Keoki to label themselves a Super-DJ and bring 
a rock star image to a supposed anti-establishment scene. Now this, a 
best DJ competition. Lets go out and find the best grain of sand or lets 
go out and look for the best blade of grass. 

Or better yet, lets come up with the BEST MARKETING SCHEME we can use to 
sell the public a CD that, like it or not, represents the best DJ in the 
country.

Best DJ, we dont need no steenkin' best DJ.

Dear DJ hardware: sorry if I offended you. It seems you're taking this 
very seriously. Perhaps you'd like to enter yourself as best DJ?

Due to the need for more space and renovations in progress at club 
chamemeon we have to move the afterhours to CLUB 37 here in Syracuse...It 
is just about the same amount of distance as Club Chameleon from the 
venue, However, it is about twice the size. The venue will be charging an 
additional $2 for afterhours.  Those who come on a bus, it is included in 
your bus ticket.

Buses are being run by:
Johnnyu from Albany area
Stuck on Earth from NYC area
Space Cadets collective from Baltimore/DC area
kamikaze from toronto
trance fusion from ottowa
and chris from portland maine is also running one!

for those of you who forgot the line up or need more info you can call 
316-63-PHATO or 315-637-4286. Bus information and ticket locations are 
also available on these lines.

any other questions e-mail ploot@mailbox.syr.edu

Hey, Mindkiss:

Here's the rest of that article for you:


Taken from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Weekend Magazine, Friday, March 
29, 1996.  Reprinted without permission.  Typed by Bryce Lynch.

'I make jungle'

As complex as his music is, 24-year-old electronic musician and 
Pittsburgh native Joe LeSesne explains his part in the scene simple:  "I 
make jungle."

One of about 10 of his kind stateside and a few hundred in the U.K., 
LeSesne performs live, original jungle under the name 1.8.7.

Keyboard, sampler and mixer in tow, he jumps around on stage like a rock 
musician, dreadlocks swinging to the beat.  But instead of nailing guitar 
riffs between bops, his hands land precisely on the right keys, buttons, 
and knobs to make intricate dance tracks out of tiny bits of sound.

Not one for sitting still, LeSesne talks in spats of wisdom specked with 
childlike wonder.  Listening to him is like following along with the 
bouncing ball.

He is featured on several compilations and has performed at major events 
like last summer's Ravestock in Iowa, a historical three-day event where 
he played in place of the international techno artist Moby.  Currently, 
he is working on a new tape and collaborations with reggae vocalists, 
including MC Soy Sos of CFI Massive.

"When I was a kid I always figured that music in the late 1990's or the 
year 2000 was going to sound totally different from what I heard then," 
LeSesne muses.  "I guess I made an unconscious effort to do that, to see 
that happen."

LeSesne has a musical history like a pinball, having touched on 
everything from rap, soul and R&B, to rock, punk, and the school band.  
His brother and sister were hip hop and disco DJs and he got an ear for 
jazz from his father's old records.  He's had formal instruction on 
clarinet, guitar, and piano and played saxophone and bass in various bands.

His first taste of electronic music came over shortwave radio late one 
night in 1988.  The acid house music he heard in the background of a BBC 
program captivated him.  He searched it out, and three years later he 
found raves through Deadly Buda, whom he know from the punk scene.  
LeSesne's interest turned to love.  He sold his music gear, bought a drum 
machine and keyboard, and set out to make a brave new music.

"I knew that with sampling you could make sounds that no one had heard 
yet just from blending sounds you took from the real world and looping 
them differently."

The tools of jungle lurk around every mainstream corner, from ad jingles 
to pop music.  It differs because "it comes at the sound from every 
conceivable angle.  It takes what's latent and possible in the instrument 
and does things that a jingle writer would never want to do because it 
would sound too weird."

"Some jungle songs are really beautiful and they might even make you want 
to cry.  Some jungle songs are just downright ugly - they remind you of 
an inner-city neighborhood just burned out from the riot.  It spans the 
range of human emotions and that's what I like most about it."

"Purists" argue technology robs music of humanity and depth.  LeSesne 
disagrees.  All music uses technology, be it an electric guitar's 
amplifier to the acoustics of a symphony orchestra.  Even the piano, he 
says, was scorned at first because humans don't touch the strings.  "It's 
called techno because it uses technology, not because technology is using 
the person."

"In most cases, people who [say] it's just heartless, soulless music, 
they haven't heard the music out there that isn't,"  LeSesne says.  
"People that say that just need to wake up, realize it's 1996 and open 
their minds a little bit."

Misunderstanding parents and fire-and-brimstone pundits don't faze 
LeSesne.  "It was like that with jazz, it was like that with rock, it was 
like that with rap.  Negative old-people attention, that's a given."

He takes negative press as a fact of life but says it can hurt a young 
scene.  Controversy over Tunnel Vision, a party last June in the Corliss 
Tunnel, made it difficult for neighbors to sleep that night and for 
promoters to rent spaces for parties afterwards.

LeSesne thinks techno and jungle may owe some success to raging 
condemnations, the same way rock 'n' roll changed from "devil's music" to 
an institution.

Jungle is a love-it-or-hate-it subgenre that LeSesne feels may form its 
own scene.  While many Pittsburgh-born musicians have become famous 
elsewhere, much rave and jungle talent is committed

<see page 17>

Rave revue

>From page 15

to this scene.  "Maybe jungle will be to Pittsburgh what grunge was to 
Seattle."

The Lollipop mission

In January, 750 gathered in Monroeville for Jungle Warfare, the nation's 
largest all-jungle party to date.  It was organized jointly by UDG and 
the Lollipop Posse, the city's "hometown" promotions group.  The two 
groups joined forces "in the name of friendship," say Natalie Horne and 
Michael Witt, the two halves of the Lollipop Posse.

Horne and Witt (a.k.a. Zone), whose greetings invariable include warm 
hugs and genuine smiles, are more than business partners - they have been 
a couple for more than a year.  Business and life combine across the 
board for the two, whose holistic relationship reflects their highly 
personal promotion style.  "The way you live your life is the way you are 
in the scene too," says Horne.

Horne, the only prominent female in the Pittsburgh rave scene, is a cross 
between Sigourney Weaver and Emma Thompson.  With a soft smile and strong 
voice she talks about the scene like a proud mother, but she's not about 
baking cookies.

"I'm very aggressive and enthusiastic when I promote," says the 20-year-
old Robert Morris marketing student and Harrisburg native.

Witt, 23, is her equal and opposite.  A computer-animation student at the 
Art Institute, his soft-spoken manner makes his opinions seem 
particularly strong.

The Lollipop Posse was born on Jan. 27, 1995, with a party called 
Beginning.  "We thought the scene, at that point, was going downhill," 
says Horne.  "We started working on one and did things the way we thought 
they should be done, like local promoting, lower-cost flyers, being able 
to talk person-to-person."

Beginning led to Sundaze, a small all-house music party, and Jungle 
Warfare, Lollipop's third and largest event.  They do "hometown, 
close-knit" events, says Witt, rather than flashier, large-scale projects 
that depend more on out-of-town support.

"It just seems that it's more successful whenever you have happier people 
than if you have a huge party [with] unhappy people," Horne reasons.

Lollipop's friendly approach makes good business sense.  Promoters often 
hand out thousands of fliers, but for Beginning, they gave out only 
1,000.  450 people came - a 45 percent return.  This is proof to Horne 
that "person-to-person promotion works really well."

She appreciates that the scene is propelled by young and dedicated 
leaders.  "Kids producing for kids is an excellent idea....  To have 
friends supporting each other is the best thing.  That's what the scene 
is all about."

Witt says space owners seldom know just what to expect, but react 
positively afterwards.  "They see that you can have 500 people come 
together and have no bad things happen, no fights or altercations 
whatsoever - which amazes a lot of people."

The scene has probably suffered most from allegations of reckless drug 
use.  As a rule, promoters, DJs and musicians do not condone drugs, 
saying they pollute the purity of the experience.  "What we promote is 
togetherness, the party itself," Horne says.

Drugs are an unavoidable reality, says Horne and Witt, but no more than 
in any other scene, including rock 'n' roll.  Drugs found at raves are 
less destructive and not violence-inducing, they argue.  What's more, 
Pittsburgh ravers are particularly sensible, tending to shy away from 
more harmful substances.

At any party, many people are high on nothing more than music and maybe 
some Vivarin.  "Herbal" and "organic" drugs are also gaining popularity, 
Witt says.  They are legal and safe alternatives, often high in caffeine 
and natural effedrine.

Contributing to a scene they love is the Lollipop Posse's mission.  
"Satisfying the public in Pittsburgh is not what we're about.  Satisfying 
the particular interest group that we belong to is what we're about," 
Witt says.  "We're not selling tickets to Steeler games, here."

Horne laughs.  "Otherwise we'd be makin' lots of money, baby!"

They hope to promote "'till we're too old to do it," Witt says.  What 
keeps them going?  "People," he says.  "Love of the music and being able 
to go somewhere with 500 of your closest friends."

"The belief that it will get better.  The belief that it will stay good," 
Horne adds.

"I've gone through stages where I thought it was not going to get any 
better, that it was just a mess.  But when we do another party, it always 
renews my faith in the scene."

excellent article, and I'm glad to see the scene get some good press.

I don't know if the message was intended to be a DJ contest or anything like
that....it could be just to see what DJs people would like to have a CD of.

Moonshine puts out some good stuff, but if you don't like it , you can just
buy a mixtape.

For anyone interested, David Morales was just on MTV's the grind, doing a
special remix show for spring break.  Hali Berry (sp) was giving him mad
props and hosting the show.  Maybe MTV is getting a clue, they have
brought in outside DJS a couple a times.  Those show actually were quite
good.  The music on this particular show seemed to feature entirely
david morales remixes of killer house tracks.  Anyway, thought this was
interesting, they will probably air the show again soon, this was the
third or fourth time it has aired already.  Finally, we seem to be getting
a little respect from the powers that be.

one two one 2, check it...

on april 20th 1996 "420" will unite the midwest tribes in an
event that will shake the very foundation of our culture. 
presented by cleveland's own psychoactive and spawntaneous,
420 will ignite a three day weekend long gathering of exponential
proportions compared to nothing you've ever seen. beginning
on friday, with the "420" preparty - "419" we'll bring together
some of the ohio heavies as columbus' own dj's doughboy and
kevy kev along with cleveland's own underground heros: dreamer,
pulse, & mike sparxx, kick this shit into high gear early. this 
will be the meeting ground..."ground zero". if you will, with the
promise of more to come, friday rolls right into saturday and after
a short rest (maybe) and a quick snack (probably) you'll find
yourself seemingly right back where you started - then the bomb
drops...you are submerged as 420 dome incases you inside of its
dubtribal, ectomorphic warp bubble and transports you via digital
direct audio and visual feeds across folded space. time and physics
cease, matter and anti-matter collide and you're dropped into the
3 room core chamber with derrick may, stacie pullen, robert armani,
john acquaviva, dj spun, carlos, feelgood, dj who, rob paine, 
astroboy, baggadonuts, rob sherwood & mike filly, gank and release.
just then, the thundering public address, which holds your very
heart in its hands. extends it's control by engaging the live acts:
dub tribe, ectomorph, the legion of green men / alkahest, tripper
information system and chris pulse. all of this compiled with an
unrelenting, all intelligent lightstorm, and laser cannons bad
enough to take down luke skywalker. you leave breathless...but
that's when you have to prepare for the afterparty..."421" brings
you back with dieselboy, doc martin, psychoactive's sleepy c and
o'keefe. all spaces are confirmed. all flights are booked. the
trandimensional migration will commence. come to cleveland ready
to turn over your soul to the hype which we are addicted. your
experience will never die.

the journey begins with the 420 preparty. 5 jocks lay down the
wax all night. but don't tucker yourself, you've got a long way
to go...

Malheur !!!!


Apres un week-end a donf, je suis tombe sur l'emission Zone Interdite diffusee
dimanche soir sur M6. Avec des potes, on a donc regarde avec attention le 
reportage annonce comme une enquete sur l'extasy en France. Entre nous, les
reactions ont ete plutot vives ....

-This weekend, I was watching the "forbidden zone" on the french tv channel 6 
sunday night. With a couple of my friends we saw a report on the extasy usage 
in France. Between us, we reacted deadply to this show.

Bien qu'il semble que le sujet soit taboo sur la mailing list, j'attends avec
impatience vos reactions sur cette drogue, sur la denonciation permanente des
medias, sur l'amalgame fait entre drogue et techno, etc...

-even though this subject seems to be taboo on this mailing list, I like to 
get your reactions.

	Pour ma part je rigole bien haut a l'annonce des chiffres anglais sur 
la consommation de la pillule d'amour : 

here are the numbers for the consumption of X in England :

	- 58 morts en Angleterre en 5 ans (dues aux X)
-58 dead en Uk in 5 year (due to X)
	- 500 000 pillules consommees par week-end dans le meme pays
-500 000 pills eaten every weekend
  Si mes calculs sont corrects, il y a environ 52*500000=25 000 000 d'X par 
an,
soit 25 000 000*5 = 125 000 000 en 5 ans. 
this give us 125 000 000 hits of x eaten in 5 years
Comme la consommation n'a pas toujours
ete aussi importante, on peut reduire ce chiffre a 58 000 000 depuis 91 (pour
faciliter les calculs). D'apres les chiffres, et ce n'est pas moi qui les 
inventent, on a donc 1/1 000 000 de chance de crever avec un exta. Je trouve 
ca
completement delirant.
Basicaly, we have 1 chance out of 1 000 000 to die from X. This is crasy.


	Bien sur, je considere que tout doit etre fait pour preserver la vie, et
que 58 morts, c'est deja beaucoup. Mais a titre de comparaison, il y a eu 22
morts a la chasse en France l'annee derniere, et je n'ose imaginer le nombre 
de 
noyes.
-to compare the 58 death in 5 years by X, there have been 22 people that died 
last year in france due to hunting accidents. I don't want to know how many 
died from drowning.

	Ceci pour vous dire que je trouve scandaleux de la part des medias de 
faire naitre une veritable crise de paranoia face a cette drogue (vendue en 
pharmacie pendant 60 ans) chez tous les flics de France, dans toutes les 
familles ou un gosse est barre dans la techno, etc...
	Vous auriez vu la reaction de ma mere apres le reportage. COMIQUE !!!!

-I think the media is stupid to create a feeling of paranoia in families and 
cops, when X has been sold in store (by prescription) since about 60 years in 
France. My mam lauft when she saw this report.

I like to had that FG 98.4 in Paris has been the number one techno radio 
station for years. They have helped the scene tremendously. Many dj like 
Laurent Garnier, Jeff Mills and other big DJ have spun on that radio station 
which braodcasts all other France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland..... Also 
the TV channel M^ retransmit Raves almost every Sunday. The scene would be so 
strong if the FCC did fuck around so much. Why can't you say : "Fuck" on a 
radio station here, but you can in France ?
Also FG 98.4 (known as Frequence Gay 98.4) sponsores every single rave by 
broadcasting the location of the rave just before it starts. There is almost 
no need for a voice mail, just a car stereo and you are ready to go play.

Just my opinion

Right.
I was saying that techno got exposure in Europe not because BBC and MTV 
but because iof things like Don FM, and Fantasy FM and many others. check 
out this website for a good history lesson: www.donfm.co.uk

Working at a college station if you can is a good idea but don't be 
suprised if you are resited when it comes to dance music. If you want it 
on the air you'll have to fight for it. If you start your own station 
well then you and your friends are the boss.

MTV Europe and the like didn't catch on to techno until the underground 
(which meant pirate radio) was saturated with it.
The whole reason that Europe is such a different place for our music is a 
direct result of the strict laws against setting up a pirate station as a 
means to keep a monopoly. BBC didn't have to play anything else other 
than drivel if they had no competition. The whole reason the government 
moved to grant licenses for private stations was because they finally 
realized the BBC was out of touch with what alot of people wanted to hear 
and so they created private liecenses and spruced up the BBC. One BBC 
station (Radio 1 I believe) is an all dance music station which puts most 
US stations to shame. The Brits are right, to them whe must seem like a 
bunch of gutless wankers afraid of challenging our government. 

A monopoly of the BBC type exists in America, thats why you have the same 
formats constantly played out on commercial stations (alternative, 
classic rock, country, R&b/rap) and thats why very few if any all dance 
stations exist in this country. Its up to us to break that monopoly and 
if that means breaking the law so be it. The law will change.

> going against the law imho is the wrong approach.
> 

When a law which says the airwaves belong to everyone (a public natural
resource) but later goes off to sell (auction) them off to the highest
bidder is contradictory it is then wrong. Why not auction off our 
national parks, all the old growth forests and the Chesapeak Bay while 
we're at it.


If it is the wrong aproach then why did a Federal District judge recently 
rule against the FCC in the case of Free Radio Berkely. Why is it that a 
10 Watt station is not allowed under any circumstance while many 100,000 
watt stations (which play exactly the same drivel) fill up the dial and 
often cause interference with college and community stations?

When a law which benefits one group (the rich) at the expense of another 
group (the rest of us) is allowed to stand then there is really something 
wrong in America. 


By your reasoning Rosa Parks should have never stood up and walked to the 
front of the bus to take a seat because by law black people were not 
allowed to do that. Just because something is a law doesn't mean it is right.
Its up to all of us to determine what is and isn't a just law. Each time 
someone does an illegal drug they're breaking the law. Jaywalking? 
Breaking the law. Dropping a candy wrapper in the street, breaking the 
law....



The FCC what formed to searve "in the public interest" they seem to have 
forgotten that and that Judge out in California seemed to have reminded them
that the public was not just multi million doallar corporations.

So many narrow minds around here.

People complain about promoters making money.
people complain about MTV sucking
people complain about the scene getting commercial.

WAKE UP. This is the end of the 90's.

Techno would not exist if it was not pressed on records. How many labels 
distribute records ? A lot. Why because they make MONEY. Techno came out of 
the underground because people saw the future of it and that it can bring 
money.
Raves are cormmecial. It is an event for people to have fun while listening to 
techno. It is a service provided to you. You pay in dollars. The promoters, 
DJs, records labels, smart bar, sound companies, ligthing companies, video 
companies, drug dealers, venders, warehouse owners, printers, they all try to 
make money. This is the american way of life. This society is based on money. 

Like many of you, I don't like MTV. why because they don't play the music I 
like. Yes they have a lot of commercials, but how do you expect them to make 
money and keep broadcasting if they did not make any money one way or the 
other. They are not playing techno, because the "scene" is still to small here 
in the US. I would like to see MTV play so techno and I believe one day they 
will. Instead of complaining about David Morales being on MTV, you should be 
happy that a techno astirst is actualy on MTV and non-ravers get to see what 
techno is and would may be like it. if the scene does not expand it will die.

Music, is like every else. It start small...it grows...it reaches its peak and 
falls. This is life and there is nothing narrow minds, complainers can do 
about it.Disco grew, got big and bye bye. This will be the same for Techno.it 
is the same with our lives, we grow, reach our peak and then we die. This is 
the cycle of life. If you can't see that...no comment.:(

Money is going to be in our soceity until the fall of this society and then a 
new era will come along...this is called EVOLUTION of human kind. I want to 
move forward, don't you ? We should use the past as a lesson and move on to 
grow.

A greek phylosophist said once : "Nothing is forever". Think about it with an 
OPEN mind.

French E
"Know your limits"
"If you think college is expensive, try Ignorance" (from a car bumper sticker)

PS : MTV in Europe failled because they did not see that techno was so popular 
overseas. I would say that 40 to 50 percent of the radio stations in France 
play techno. 80% of the clubs in France play techno. the largest raves are in 
Europe. MTV did not acknolege this and failled.

==================================================================

ahh finally someone who has looked beyond the music, beyond our li'l
scene, and has seen the world and its future.

critical mass will be achieved only when there is global consciousness.
it is inevitable because without it, our planet can not survive. and
this is the bottom line of rave culture, all the cultures. to look at
one another and realize that we are one. because we all come from the
same source - our mother earth. but we haven't taken care of our mother
because we were so busy taking care of ourselves, seeing who can make
the most money. what will all that money be good for when there is nothing
left to spend it on. because that is exactly what our future will hold
if things don't change - nothing.

think about the future. you are the future. 

peace. love. unity. respect from the family of light,

On behalf of Mike , myself and the rest of Holiday productions I pass on my
sincere apologies that Onionz will not be able to make it . Once again he has
felt the need to cancel yet again. Well anyhow we got Sun to replace him who
hasn't played in these [arts for more than a year and for $12 all night you
can't beat it. I promise a good time will be had by all. Ask anyone who
attended Nutcracker.


Sincereley,

Kevin

Making money of the scne and the music is not bad.....



>people complain about MTV sucking

Well it does suck!!!!!


>people complain about the scene getting commercial.

Well it is and Its bad but its not.. What is bad about it is in the USa
when that happens sopmething becomes a trend and "everyone" must do it so
it gets milked dry for what it is thus runing something good....... We CANT
prevent this from happening its going to happen .. but we can ateast try to
make it stay PURE....

FUCK trying to keep shit undergroun or restricting people what ever..
"rave" is now a popular term.. THe only safe and BEst thing WE CAN DO IS
KEEP THE MUSIC PURE.... THe scene was sold out as soon as the FIsrt doallr
was excanged for a party........ BUt if you keep the Music true to Its
nature keep the sound GOOD keep it PURE keep it QUALITY dont Regeritate it
into some fast buck copy of the last song.. the THE music will staty and
the Media will get Bored of this new Trend and move onto something else
Thus We pick up and move on partying again..

Just my words of chaos

the thing about MTV and music...when a musical trend gets huge, the 
quality of the music goes down...i happen to think that when the whole
grung/alternative thing, right before it hit, had some very good
music to offer...now, we have bush and collective soul...*gag*...
this would happen to dance music...also, there are more and more 
dance/techno artsists putting things out the punk way...independently...
the bassbin twins, for example...in fact, i myself, am considering
producing a record...and i will it out myself...no fuckin labels...
me...all me...why?...cuz i love the music...and i don't give a shit
about the money...sure, money rules things...but thats no reason to
be apathetic...apathy=death...

This has already happened to techno.  In fact, it happened a long time 
ago.  It's funny, from time to time a thread comes along saying "oh no, 
it's the end of our SCENE man!!", but in reality, the undergroundness of 
techno and raving is long gone.

That's not to say there *aren't* underground factions of people making their 
own distinct blend of electroculture happen and work for them.  There 
are.  If you care enough to be mad at more people liking what you like, 
or if you get tired of the same old records, do something about it and 
make your own mark.  Otherwise, don't complain.

* any DOCMARTEN.. same as Wink 
* any onionz 
* any Terry Mullen 
* Junior Vasquez (no queen lyrical house shit.. just the hard trance)
* On-E


I could trade with:

* Keoki (recorded live from a friend's radio show at American U in DC) (no 
  other such rec.)
* Keoki (when he spun at a friend's house) (no other such rec.)
* Scott Hardkiss (when he spun at my friend's b-day party, several days 
  before his appearance at Sting in DC last November) - No other such 
  recording in existence - several excellent dubplates on there, as always,such as 
  the brilliant - never released - Hardkiss version of "rocket man" by Elton 
  John).. a rare gem.
* Robbie Hardkiss (same - b-day party) 
* Scott Hardkiss (live from room zero)
* DJ DAN (CA) 
* Simply Jeff (live in Charlotte)
* DJ SIMON (SAn Francisco - Live at a club in SF)
* Jon Williams (CA sound)(Kitchen sync - a very old favorite - full of 
  classics) 
* DJ FLEX (upstate NY)
* Osheen (Rhode Island)
* Frankie Bones (several - older ones, like "afterhours")
* Scott Henry (several - older wuns)
* Mastervibe (UK jungle)
* Soulslinger (NY jungle)
* Steve Loria (CA) - 1993... great great tape... GREAT TUNES.
* Phil Latorre (DC's own).. very VERY FUNKENGROVEN
* Sam I AM (DC) - one of the best mixed tapes I have ever owned... 
  (trippy, acidey groovey house) 2 yrs old and a classic.. OLD SKOOL never 
  got any better.

I will provide copies on high-quality tapes, dubbed on a good 
soundsystem. I expect the very same. I am looking ONLY for HIGH quality 
recordings, NOTHING LESS. 

Thanks!! 

Ali

Thats a great attitude if you are independantly wealthy. Have you looked 
at what it costs to get one "12 pressed from start to finish.

If you want to do that and can do that fine but don't down those of us 
who can't. As fr as the music suffering thats bullshit. In the UK there 
are VIDEOS yes VIDEOS for jungle records and they get played. Does that 
mean that jungle is crap no? Does that mean that is is commercial no.  It 
just means people don't have to starve themselves to make it.

If the scene goes more commercial there will be crap music, but there 
will be good music too. Just as there is now. Its really dumb to use 
grunge as an example. There really is little comparison. Grunge did it to 
itself by not staying true to its sound. Techno in general is already 
popular and as most of us would say "commercialized" in Europe yet most 
records DJ's ERE spin come from there. Crap music, I think not.

look, the market is already flooded with crappy music...yes, i have looked
into the pressing of records and such...it is expensive...which is why its
good to get people to help out, and sponsor and shit like that...i'm not 
saying to go totally do-it-yourself...but i'd rather stay on an indy 
label than a corperation...i guess its the punk side of me...but sorry...
i don't have much respect for going out for the money...anyway, i think 
there is already alot of shit music out there...and there would be so
much more if techno went more mainstream than it already is...i don't
mind it becoming popular...but there hasta be an underground that lives
and thrives or else, the music we know today will be spoiled...

#If the scene goes more commercial there will be crap music, but there

somehow these arguments feel like deja vu all over again
what does "stay true" mean?
just the mention of it makes me think of that french language organization
battling the "corruption" of their language.
grunge did not destroy itself.
big label corporate money did not destroy grunge.
if there is more grunge than ever, there is more crap grunge then there
ever was before.  if you don't care enough about grunge to sort through
all the crap to find the gems, then your impression is that there is an
awful lot of crap grunge (true), and therefore all grunge is now crap?
(not true).

insert any other musical form for "grunge" when it explodes into
commerical popularity.

so i am agreeing with joe, except that he seems to contradict himself
mid paragraph w/ the comments about grunge.  to compare what happened
to grunge to what might happen to (techno, jungle, polka) is not dumb.
valiant's _conclusions_ about what actually happened might be limited
by his perceptions of grunge, which are in turn limited by what the a&r
guys decide to try to sell as grunge.

the big label guys don't necessarily have the patience or desire to
actually find the quality stuff.  if what they put out is not truly
wretched to a large portion of the population, usually that will
suffice.  the promotions machine will take care of the rest.

here, i always like to finish off with hypothetical questions, so...

given a choice of two scenarios:

to find 20 good records out of 100.
to find 100 good records out of 1000.
which would you prefer?

dono

(obviously the first is more "underground", the second "commercialized")

First of Valiant, learn to edit your replies so  you aren't quoting 1000 
lines of text unneccessarily.



Let me make myself very clear as you seem to keep missing the point.

Much of what you listen to right now comes from a commercial scene (europe).


There is much crap music today.
There is just as much underground crap as mainstream crap.

Major Label does not automatically = crap
Underground does not automatically = good

If an artist is making good music and not starving whats it to you?
If their good music is equally widely availble with they crap  music what 
difference does it make?

Read this please and read it good. The fact that Europe has a mainstream 
above ground scene does not negate the fact that it ALSO HAS A THRIVING 
UNDERGROUND.

Now I would argue that the reason Europe does have a thriving underground 
is because the $$ trickles down from the mainstream scene and fresh faces 
trickle in from the mainstream scene. The music stays underground even if 
some of it is good and breaks through to the mainstream audience it does 
not mean the track was not good to begin with.

Some ravers won't be happy until raves are just parties held in someones 
basement with 20 of their friends and tons of E.
(not saying thats a bad thing but it would be a regression).

People, poeple!

Why do you worry so much?
It's not gonna happen. Jungle will live on.
Just take a look how rave has evolved.
Sure, most of the old techno style that has survived is now 
commercialiased but still you can find good quality undrground
pieces. And fortunately the "2-Unlimited" phenomena was noticed
only on this style (a good group turning to the money and spoiling
the rest of the scene). I still listen to the 92 techo tracks.
Techno is very popular here in the States (most people us 'techno'
as a substitute word for rave) and must be because of the whole
commercialisation of it.
But what about the other styles?
Rave offers such variety. Even the "old" ambient and trance
styles are still "underground" . So are the breakbeat-noids.

My first jungle song I heard was M-Beat/General Levi's
"Incredible" on a video-clip for MTV!
My first thought were exactly those:
"Hmmmm...the beat is great, really something but the rest
 is crap, but I guess in this commercialised world this
 will become a hit."
And every jungle piece I hear is better than the other!
The scene is getting better not worse.

Consider this: my whole jungle collection consists of
two CDs and my computer hard disk.
The two CDs, compilations are the only money I paid for jungle!
All my jungle listening comes from computer music modules.
The authors of those don't expect any money for it.
And they have been producing better and better music.

But anyway, keep the conversation going on!
Tis something I rarely encounter here in the States unfortunately...

Long live the scene!
Aristotelis

Btw, I forgot to mention for the people that don't know this
already that I am from Greece.
The scene there is alive and kicking and has been since the first
beat was fired.
And all th parties and popularity hasn't ruined a thing.
Its amazing that a thing that big still manages to stay
"underground".
It's like a common secret.
Although a greek company has been producing some cool
"rave clothes" which turned lame after some thousands
were sold...
But the music still rocks, the people are still cool 
and the parties are something to wait for.
The guys from Athens might know better (I'm from Crete). :-)

The Prodigy is still a great group even though they
are walking very close to the money path.
Their music is still top and they are still a cult thing.
Even though they sell t-shirts and caps of them.

So, chill and enjoy the music! :-)

Uh, what?  The authors don't expect any money?  Let's be serious here.  
It costs a lot of money to produce records, and most "underground" labels 
lose a great deal of money with each record they press.  Maybe you meant 
that the artists don't expect to make a lot of money from their efforts, 
but we do expect something.  If you like, say, jungle, and you want it to 
stay, you have a duty to support it.  If you don't, and if no one 
doesn't, it will go away.  There will be no more money to produce jungle 
records if no one buys them.

No, no, no...
You were nno paying much attention to my post.
If you did, you would understand that I mean the authors of the computer 
jungle mods. They don't even get back the money they paid for their
hardwaree and software.
They are not even famous. Only amongts the fans.
The mods are free for all to enjoy.

Tsiou!

Take a look at Aminet, the Amiga software archive of the Internet.
They even release CD complilations of their stuff (ten so far).
It has a lot of mirrors around the world.
For the States check out:

ftp.wuarchive.com ftp.netnet.net ftp.amigalib.net 

The dir is /pub/aminet

Mods you can find in the mods subdir of aminet.
There are different subdirs with names of music styles and such.
Jungle has its own dir, jungl .
Also check out the mods made by Kaa and Celsius.
And there are a lot of others not in these categories.

Mine are mostly from here, and also from other sources.

Also check out the RECENT file of the aminet root dir.
It contains the uploads, updated three times a day,
with description of each.
And if you are feeling adventerous, try to d/l the INDEX
file which has a index of all the archive in simular style
to the RECENT file.

Have in mind that every file comes with a .readme text file
that usually contains a short description of the main file
and in music sometimes its music style.

All trackers supported.

Have fun d/l!

Ok guys, for those who would like to try to get mods
off the Aminet there are some things to consider.

1) All files are archived with the lha/lhz archiver.
   Versions for it exist for the Unix, Microsoft and I believe Macintosh
   platforms.
2) The filenames could be a problem for Microsoft system users.
   Not only the archive filenames but the archived files too.
   Amiga users use a tla prefix for the tracker format in the
   filename that can be a problem to old Microsoft 8.3 filenames.
   Fortunately for them, some use a suffix, some nothing at all.
3) The readme file text format uses th Amiga/Unix eol codes.
   That is that on the Microsoft/Macintosh platforms may look strange.
4) Some uploaders have gone brave and packed their modules either with
   old Powerpacker compressor or with the new XPK library system.
   Fortunately this is rare.
5) Modules having a med or med8 suffix/prefix (and those of the med 
   subdir) are made with the MED/Octamed tracker. I am not sure if
   a player for the Microsoft system supports this format (I heard
   that one does and the splendid Octamed system is been ported
   to the Windows) and I don't think there is anything available for
   the Unix and Macintosh platforms.
   This is a big shame because there a lot made with MED and they are
   all incredible.

I hope I haven't forgotten anything!
Problems aside, have fun! :-)

Ok, since the subject is still hot, here are some words of advice from 
the master Redd Kaa. Btw, this is to be taken lightly although everything
is true!

HOW TO SCORE A HUGE COMMERCIAL HIT AND 
BRING THE BACON HOME IN A SAFE WAY!
(as revealed to Redd Kaa from 
experience in the musical industry)

THE 10 GOLDEN RULES!

1)Find the most rehashed chord progression 
  you can.Paddle around it  "ad infinitum"

2)Put on an insolent and boring bassdrum
  thump going on and on

3)Forget about snare drum.It has no place
  in contemporary dance music.Claps too.

4)Add the bassline following religiously
  the chords

5)Use only overheard sounds.New is enemy
  to success.

6)Add a watery bit of the flavor of the
  month (wheter it is)

7)Of course make only predictable changes
  during the song.People must not think.
  People must dance.And pay

8)Give the whole thing a stupid title.
  Remember:when it comes to words,
  less words mean bigger hit.

9)Add some very simple sing-along female
  vocal.

10)And now hit the big time!Go for the 
   gusto!Bite the big one!-The chorus-
   simple as hell!!

Three more rules in case this works:

11)Hire one or more black girls to 
   lip-sync in the video.Even if the
   voice is male!This ALWAYS works.

12)Prepare some shocking declaration
   to get some hype in your MTV interview
   like:"I ate my twin brother when i was
   in the womb" or"I am a surf-punk-skate-
   tech-free-nazi-yoga-jazz-psych-commie-
   vegisexual,but only on even days"

13)Earn incredible amounts of popularity.
   Dip into paranoia,self-adoration
   and heavy drugs to give yourself an 
   attitude and an acceptable social image.
   Detox and marry often.Divorces are good 
   too.Spend all your money on crap


And success is served!
 
:-)

ok, someone asked me to post more details on this so here goes:

lenny's spinning at mekka, a club here in columbus, at an afterparty for a 
fashion show.  it should start around 11pm as usual, and end at 2.30 am.  
i think lenny'll be on most of that time.  admission is probably $5 as 
usual, but it's 18 & over and you must BRING your ID!!!!

directions:

from the north: get to I 71 S, to columbus, then get off at the SPRING ST
exit.  it's one way so just stay on it till you're just west of downtown. 
then, go about 2-3 miles, and just past the old state pen is NEIL AVE,
take a RIGHT on neil.  then take a LEFT on DUBLIN.  once on dublin, look for 
a big warehouse with lots of cars parked near it.  that's it, address 382
dublin. 

from the south:  
take I 71 N to columbus, get to downtown columbus, then get off at the 
BROAD ST exit, take a LEFT.  go down to HIGH ST (about 10 lights), 
take a RIGHT on high st, go up about 3 blocks and then take a LEFT on SPRING 
ST.  follow as above to the space.

from the west:
take I 70 E to columbus, to I 71 N, then get off downtown at the BROAD ST 
exit and follow as from the south.

from the east:
take I 70 W to columbus, to I 71 N, then get off downtown at the BROAD ST 
exit and follow as from the south.


hope ta see ya

well, i fixed up the web site for the rom, so check it out. 
http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html
anyhow here it is....

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkII
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

Submissions to: s0176326@cc.ysu.edu (preferred) or

one two one 2, check it...

on april 20th 1996 "420" will unite the midwest tribes in an
event that will shake the very foundation of our culture. 
presented by cleveland's own psychoactive and spawntaneous,
420 will ignite a three day weekend long gathering of exponential
proportions compared to nothing you've ever seen. beginning
on friday, with the "420" preparty - "419" we'll bring together
some of the ohio heavies as columbus' own dj's doughboy and
kevy kev along with cleveland's own underground heros: dreamer,
pulse, & mike sparxx, kick this shit into high gear early. this 
will be the meeting ground..."ground zero". if you will, with the
promise of more to come, friday rolls right into saturday and after
a short rest (maybe) and a quick snack (probably) you'll find
yourself seemingly right back where you started - then the bomb
drops...you are submerged as 420 dome incases you inside of its
dubtribal, ectomorphic warp bubble and transports you via digital
direct audio and visual feeds across folded space. time and physics
cease, matter and anti-matter collide and you're dropped into the
3 room core chamber with derrick may, stacie pullen, robert armani,
john acquaviva, dj spun, carlos, feelgood, dj who, rob paine, 
astroboy, baggadonuts, rob sherwood & mike filly, gank and release.
just then, the thundering public address, which holds your very
heart in its hands. extends it's control by engaging the live acts:
dub tribe, ectomorph, the legion of green men / alkahest, tripper
information system and chris pulse. all of this compiled with an
unrelenting, all intelligent lightstorm, and laser cannons bad
enough to take down luke skywalker. you leave breathless...but
that's when you have to prepare for the afterparty..."421" brings
you back with dieselboy, doc martin, psychoactive's sleepy c and
o'keefe. all spaces are confirmed. all flights are booked. the
trandimensional migration will commence. come to cleveland ready
to turn over your soul to the hype which we are addicted. your
experience will never die.

frank just reminded me, that no one posted about the net meet @
Chocolate Friday on pb-cle-raves (there wuz a post on mw-raves),
so here goes:

i think it wuz nitroboy who posted: net meet @ the smart/drink bar
@ exactly 1:35.30 am. i dunno why he picked that exact time, but
knowing me i'll prolly miss it, cuz i never have a clue what time
it is & always miss net meets - even the ones i planned (like @
Daydream), so if anyone see's a tall asian kid w/ glasses on the
floor come net meet time, come grab my ass to the bar.

oh yah the party IS @ the U4IA club in west cleveland again (big
surprise).

back to cleaning my room before frank gets here...

Of course this is america and every time something become popleur the media

THe one possible good thing that might happen is look at ALternative...NOt

What it means is keep doing what you've been doing and don't suddenly 
change your sound for the sole purpose of making it more "accessible". 
Good example of people who have "stayed true" despite mainstream 
popularity: Goldie, Aphex Twin, Richie Hawtin, LTJ Bukem, The Chemical 
Brothers, Massive Attack, Bjork, etc....

Actually most big label a&r people only look into something if there is 
sufficient "buzz" surrounding the artist.

Given the choice between a 20% chance and a 10% chance I choose 20%. 

I think you meant:

to find 20 good records out of 100
or find 200 good records out of 1000

Either way its even. If you can tell me why there would be a 10% less 
chance of finding something good if there were more music being produced 
than now then by all means go right ahead.

Welp, just recoverin from last night and thought I'd write a li'l revu 
since I never done one before :)

This being only my third cleveland party I don't have too much to go by, 
but I thought it was pretty decent compared to other parties I've been to 
in the past.  My girlfriend and I got to u4ia just as the hiphop sets 
were ending and dieselboy was going on. His set was incredible! I heard 
him at daydream but just couldn't catch a rythm, but this time I was 
huggin the speakers through his whole set, whoa! I believe SleepyC was up 
next but I wuz just chillen through most of his set.  Sun was awesome, 
his set just kept gettin better an better as it progressed.  I think Ryde 
and then Joeski were next, although by that time I had terrible leg 
cramps and couldn't dance at all, I was really bummin, but I still had 
fun just groovin around sittin on the floor :)  I tried to get my ass up 
for the last dj's set (Mike Filly?) and kinda did for a while, but my 
legs were killin me so I had to take it eazy..Next thing I knew the music 
stopped and the lights went on, I glanced at my watch an it wuz exactly 
6:06 :)  I wuz kinda hopin it'd go till 7, but ohwell.  It was really 
cool just listenin to the kids around me talkin about which city they 
were headed to the next night, when the party was just barely over, 
that's not something I ever saw where I was from (albuquerque, NM).  All 
in all I had a really great night, especialy because it was my 
girlfriends second party ever, and boy did she ever catch the vibe, I 
never seen her grin so wide for so long in my life! oh yea, totaly missed 
the net meet (by the time I checked my watch it waz already 2.20) did 
anybody show up? Will definatly have to make it next time an meet some of 
you peoples :)  Welp, that's my li'l revue, hope you liked the story of 
my night :-)

Thats right and you know the Jive Turkeys will be back again this year to 
promote free renegade parties to insure that you can 1) see what a REAL 
renegade is like b) always get your groove on for the price of fresh air 
and c) make sure that the nice weather of the late spring and summer is 
taken advantage of to its full extent. We all agree that one thing that 
keeps pricves down and a scene solid (like in Pittsburgh) is the 
occasional free renegade with nothing but a few cool lights a kickin' 
sound system and a bunch of DJ's spinning it for free.  Same phat 
location with the citty as our backdrop behind the DJ's.

I got tired of sending information out to all my friends about the MASSIVE
420 rave to be held In Cleveland on April 20th (Duh!)
So I hooked up a little Web Page format of the Flyer with text info from
stevie t(syt@po.cwru.edu)
even if you arent going to the rave (too far away etc.) you should still
check it out I did a little Gif Animation of the flyer
the URL is:

http://www.oberlin.edu/~jbrick/420/420.html

There are some other cool techno related Shockwave Movies there if you have
the required Software.
Enjoy and tell me what you think!
peace out

jbrick

Re: children's records....

Can't help you with Seseme Street.  I have a Strawberry Shortcake record 
back at home that I can copy for you, but I'm not prepared to part with it.

If you want some neat samples (that unfortunately I don't have on vinyl), 
try Zap Mama, an afropop group that puts all others to shame.  Much of 
their stuff is a capella, and often they just speak, or speak over music, 
and very often in French (with various African accents).  I also have 
some Brazillian music if you're into that.  Different languages are 
always fun, and Portuguese is really musical to the American ear.

Spoken word:  KEN NORDINE is the king of spoken word.  His stuff is hard 
to find on vinyl, but I have his 2 best CDs if you wanted to drop it on 
tape.  Look for "Colors" (24 or so 90 second poems with jazz in the back 
about different colors) and "The best of Word Jazz Volume 1" (Rhino).  
This is one of my favorite albums of all time.

also, I have a Watergate Comedy hour record, Orsen Welles reading a 
satirized version of the constitution, Ricoardo jimenez or something 
talking to high school students (a very hokey psuedo-comedy album from 
the early 60s) and a record about some really bad comedian from the 20s 
or 30s.  

I go to pitt and live in the burgh if you ever were in the area and 
wanted to check this stuff out.

Good luck!

Bill: Yes, capitalism will run its course.  We will run out of people to
exploit, about the time we run out of clean air.  I say that with all
seriousness.  

Also, splitting hairs over grammar and colloquialisms leads
to sociolinguistic prejudice and colorless speech. Plus, adj instead of
adverb adds a new shade of meaning. Several, in fact...

I have much to say about the commercialism/capitalism thing, but I'll let 
someone else restart the discussion (unless I just did...)

I'm going to make it to this Fever if i have to walk!!! :) Just
thought I'd let you all know... :) So anybody going from Pittsburgh?
Maybe I'll steal the 'rents car... Or maybe I'll find some hapless
college friend (read: SAP) to drive me?  Or maybe some nice
pittsburgher will be nice enough to offer me a ride?  I'll pay for gas
and tolls and talk real nice and meetcher momz if I have to... I can
also bring along a bevy of phat mixtapes, lollipops, hugs (the arm
kind), smiles, and intelligent witty clever conversation. :) *tooting
my own horn*  Did I mention I'm doing a bus trip to Eclipse?  Did IO
mention I'm a DJ? ;) teehee I'm being soooo silly... Anyway... shout
out if you want to go see GOD at Fever on Thursday... I hear hes a
really nice guy, and a darn good dj too... :) Soooo, please please
please tell me Fever is an option for my Thursday night... Oh, also
I'm STILL trying to find a ride to MARS on Saturday... all the same
stuff applies to that ride as does to the Fever ride :) Love, hugs, -Frank

Just a quick post to update everyone whats up with 1.8.7/Rock Stone 
Foundation.


Well, all the folks who are waiting for tapes there has been a slight 
delay. The promos should go out by the end of the week and the real tapes 
should be done soon and should go out no later than April 20. While you 
wait you may want to pick up the "This is Jungle Sky Vol II" compilation. 
Its distributed through Caroline so you should be able to get it at any 
respectable record store. My track is track 4, Dis Soun' along with MC 
Soy Sos we are collectively known as Rock Stone Foundation. The CD comp 
is out (we just got 6 in the mail today) and we will soon be recieving a 
dubplate and test pressing of the 12" single.
Already we are at work on the next RSF track and I will soon be sending 
Jungle Sky some 1.8.7 material. Currently Rock Stone Foundation is 
working with several other muscians among them 2 female soul vocalst and 
a female ragga vocalist.  I as 1.8.7 may also be collaborating with MC 
Dub2 on a track to be released later this summer either on Predators or 
Jungle Sky. I'm also working on a track with the US jungle don dieselBoy.

As for the live shows, I will be appearing with Soy Sos at ProtoKulture 
on Friday in Pittsburgh. We will also be performing as Rock Stone 
Foundation at the Jungle Sky Party May 10th in NYC at the Shelter. May 11 
I will be playing at Critical Mass in Minneapolis, MN. Oh yeah and April 
20th I will be playing at DeepUndegroundBeats (DUB) at Club Joy in 
Pittsburgh.


Once again sorry for the delays and please bear with me. Stay tuned for a 
1.8.7/Rock Stone Foundation Website in the near future.

i was just informed of the following by someone who is in contact with some
of the headliners of 420 -

Derrick May will be in Japan on the weekend of the 20th of April (not at 420)
Carlos will be in CA at his friends wedding (not at 420).

420 tickets are one sale for $30.00 (wow).  that is alot if it's true that
these two people won't be there.

im not sure if this is true, but i was told by someone who i think is
reliable.  if you know of information of the contrary please post it rather
than personaly flaming me.  im just watching out for peoples best intrests.

YEAH....He is good.  I heard him a while ago when I lived in Boulder,
Colorado.  But I dont think he should get exploited by Moonshine's JDJ
series!!  Unless he is only have fame and fortune, which I doubt.

Don't know about Carlos but you are correct, Derrick May will not be there.

_HOWEVER_, so that Transmat doesn't get sued they've arranged for Juan Atkins
to take Derrick May's place.  (Personally, I'd prefer to see Juan Atkins
anyway).

Besides, there's no shortage of talent w/ or w/o Derrick May & Carlos!

giving away some records...

imr and Orbitrecords are proud to be giving away five copies of the
limited (200 copies) pre-release of the .x09 fzz ep.  As described in the
last installment of 'from the horse's mouth...' this record explores "the
boundaries of experimental percussive dance music, integrating syncopated,
bouncy rhythms with highly abrasive jagged drum tones and samples." 

In any event, if you'd like to win a copy of this 4-track 12" single 
here's what you have to do...

	Write a review of a DJ-oriented record that is
	approximately 100 words in length.  Send it to 
	imr@world.std.com and we'll award records to the 
	five best written reviews.  

Good luck, and don't hesitate to enter since it seems that the more effort
the giveaways require the less competition there is.  We may even ask some
of the winners to write for 'slipmat' in the future since we're planning
on turning 'slipmat' into its own e-zine around the same time we convert
imr into a new Web-oriented e-zine. 

If you'd like to check out imr just send the message "subscribe" to
imr-request@world.std.com (note, though, that the e-zine covers a wide
variety of music and therefore some of the content may be of interest to
readers of this list while other content may not).

john is definately not about fame and fortune...he loves mixing and loves 
performing at parties.  He loves to know that other people are as moved 
as he is by the music.  I would like to see him playing at more gigs 
(especially like the phontasma parties) because that is where he really 
shines.

more than anything, you should ask john how he feels.  I know he wants to 
get more involved and he may not feel exploited by the deal.  Besides, I 
think that 
he would be careful about not getting into the fame and fortune bit, he 
hates that.  He doesn't care much about getting money for what he does.  
He loves parties because he feeds off of the audience and I think that 
it the best place for him to get what he wants out of it.

>hmmm still looks like yur getting yur moneys worth, i'd say!

        yeah, id say youre geting your moneys worth. but youre getting MORE
than your moneys worth with Bassrush.  also, once again, i have to stress
that most of the 420 acts have been / are soon to be / or will be again in
the midwest.  unless you are going to Bassrush 3 on the east coast this
weekend, there is no excuse (IMO) for missing Bassrush - The Midwest Rush.
alot of these acts will not be returning to the midwest soon. who wants to
miss ***SPICELAB*** !!!  =)  when you honestly weigh the options - price,
acts, technical setup, quality of past events - there is no other choice
than Bassrush.

also, btw, i wholeheartedly support Steve Cinch (aka Sleepy C), but i have
heard some shady stuff about the rest of the Spawntainious (<-sp?) crew.

Don't know about Carlos but you are correct, Derrick May will not be there.

_HOWEVER_, so that Transmat doesn't get sued they've arranged for Juan Atkins
to take Derrick May's place.  (Personally, I'd prefer to see Juan Atkins
anyway).

Besides, there's no shortage of talent w/ or w/o Derrick May & Carlos!

-djh  
===================================================================

woah! Juan Atkins, wow!

as for carlos i'll call steve cinch tonight about that. if he doesn't
know i'll just hafta call Carlos personally to see whazzup. but if he
can't make it, he'll prolly be subbed w/ another san fran dj hmmm, i 
wouldn't mind seeing his friend Dj Dan again - ahhhw yeah, remember
Dan in toronto jeff - ooooh weee!

Well, well, well, whatever happened to HONESTY!!!???  If you KNOW you
shouldn't be carrying drugs across the border, DON'T DO IT! Also, it
is just plain DUMB to LIE to a cop.  The one time I came in contact
with the law for MINIMAL violations, i told the ABSOLUTE TRUTH ahead
of time, and I am SURE they were MORE LENIENT because I DID NOT LIE!
Besides, have some DIGNITY and COURTESY for the police.  They are
doing their job!
=================================================================

actually this really happened. on our way to Trancendance we  
were stopped @ the border simply becuz sinead had blue hair
& chris had one too many piercings for a guy. however when 
we went up for the Dose two year anniversary party we had no
problems cuz we were dressed pretty normal. back me up on
this jeff & sarahS. 

we were being honest. we had nothing on us. the border cops
lied saying the dogs had smelled something hoping that we'd
say something but it was stupid because we really did have 
nothing on us. i repeat frank we WERE being honest. the cops
were lieing. also when the cops threatened to call sinead's
parents. she ALSO TOLD THE TRUTH, she had already told them
she'd be going to a party. as a result the cops did not bother
calling.   

all i can say is plastikman would be back in the states if
the border police weren't such @&%$#!

==================================================================
>     6) don't be surprised if u ask people in canada for directions

WHAT a SICK XENOPHOBIC PREJUDICED STATMENT!!!  Real nice... nuff said...
===================================================================

actually this wuz sarah'S advice to us. i really don't think
neither sarahS nor myself or jeff for that matter are sick,
xenophobic or prejudiced. however we did make one wrong turn
on our way to Trancendance & we did ask people from Toronto
for direx and they really did have no clue. again jeff can
back me up on this.

====================================================================
Sounds like Stevie got pissy after a bad experience in Canada, blamed
it all on the police and those damn Canadians (in HIS opinion not mine)
Well, I hope he never makes problems for himself if he comes to
Pittsburgh, because he'd probably end up blaming the cops and innocent
Pittsburghers... And that would REALLY piss me off :)
==================================================================== 

actually other than the slight li'l unecessary interrogation w/ the
border police, i had a tremendous time at both the Dose two year
anniversary party and the Trancendance party. i luv canadians &
candian partys (hi ecto, salami, & asya!) or else i wouldn't keep
on going up there.

funny side note the 1st speeding ticket i ever got in my life wuz
in pittsburgh (undercover cop of course) doing 70 in a 55 (cuz oof
course pennsylvania is like the only state in the US that refuses
to raise it's speed limit to 65 like everybody else) following
Hossam to a toronto party in which i 1st met joe aka 187 and damian
aka dieselboy back in the day!

i like pittsburghers i just don't like their cops - sorry if u have
an affinity w/ them frank.

===================================================================== 
Oh, and Stevie,
I'm sorry we got split up at Chocolate Friday, but I guess when you
went to White Castle I thought you had ditched us... :/  Thanks again
for the offer and sorry you had to clean your room for nothing! 
We made it home safely, and had a great time at the party, sorry
things didn't work out for you... See ya later! -Count Zer0
======================================================================

here's what happened: jinx came up to me all whining cuz he didn't
get paid. so i did what any good friend would do. i took him to get
some white castle. we came back about half an hour later. looked
everywhere for u. u can ask john of udg and jeff/stuff, but couldn't
find u. no shee-height i totally cleaned my room for yah, spent all
day doing it too. u can ask jeff/stuff, he wuz amazed that u could
actually see carpet! and i don't clean my room for just anybody =)

San Francisco=8B blasthaus is pleased to announce a sonic art
experience: PREMEDITATED BREAKDOWN,  on Thursday April 11, 1996 at the
Trocadero Transfer, 520 4th Street at Bryant in San Francisco. Doors
open at 8pm.  Music starts at 9pm. Tickets are $11 and available at
all BASS=99 outlets in addition to Reckless Records, Rough Trade and
Record Finder in San Francisco. All ages welcome.

PREMEDITATED BREAKDOWN features a live performance by NEGATIVLAND in
collaboration with beats and grooves provided by Scott & Gavin
HARDKISS and Jonah Sharp. The extravaganza also features live visual
jamming on multiple screens by filmmaker Craig Baldwin, director and
producer of Sonic Outlaws, along with Reed Bamels from Look See
Visuals. This premiere event is being presented in conjunction with
SoundCulture 96 and is brought to you by blasthaus as part of the
gallery's one year anniversary festivities.

This event marks the first live appearance by Negativland in over 3
years. The band will be improvising live with their notorious style as
evidenced by several dozen record releases dating back to 1981 and
their monthly radio show "Over the Edge" broadcast on KPFA-FM in
Berkeley in which in-coming phone lines invite callers to participate
in creating a bizarre, witty and often mysterious sonic landscape.
PREMEDITATED BREAKDOWN is their first-ever collaboration with the
rhythms of several renowned disc jockeys. Along side band members Mark
Hosler, Don Joyce, Chris Grigg, David Wills (a.k.a. =B3the Weatherman=B2)
will be the innovative HARDKISS DJ's and Space Time Continuum's Jonah
Sharp mixing the rhythmic environments and noise beds to provide a
percussive component to the event. Among the most innovative free-form
DJ's in the world, these names bring with them the key elements of the
underground rave scene to create an experience reaching from
experimental ambient soundscapes to frenetic dance energy.

The sonic artists of PREMEDITATED BREAKDOWN arise out of a media-savvy
subculture which borrows from existing sound production =8B a process
often referred to as "sampling" or "found sounds." The context of
PREMEDITATED BREAKDOWN centers around the technical aspects of sound -
it's properties and how sounds occur - along with the technical
difficulties relating to sound such as out-takes, mistakes and
jamming. In this context it becomes unclear what is =B3original=B2 anymore
and what is repurposed or "appropriated". In a world with such
aggressive media bombardment at every front, the increasing speed at
which we are forced to process sonic information alters not only what
we hear but how we hear it. Negativland has developed a truly original
way of creating and composing sound with astounding technical finesse
using existing sound bytes, noise, live sound, sonic manipulation,
interrupted signals and jamming. Don=B9t miss this rare opportunity to
partake in an unforgettable sonic art experience.


blasthaus is a gallery devoted to the convergence of art and
technology, including video, interactive sculpture, sound
installations, multimedia, and robotics. For SoundCulture 96 the
gallery will feature sonic artworks by Bureau of  Inverse Technology
(BIT),     Jim Cambell, Wang Po Shu, Kenneth Rinaldo and Amy Youngs.
The gallery is located at 217 Second Street in San Francisco.
Hours: Tue-Fri 11-6pm and Sat noon-5pm. Admission is free. For more
info call (415) 789-8044.

SoundCulture 96 is the third transpacific festival of contemporary
sound practices. It follows two highly successful SoundCulture
festivals presented in Sydney in 1991 and Tokyo in 1993. SoundCulture
96 brings together artists, researchers and cultural theorists in
performances, exhibitions, symposia, radio transmissions,
experimental, indigenous music and new media forms.
For more info call (510) 848-0124 ext. 623

welp it's that time o month again & we're trying to get the next
PLRM out by 4/20. there have been some slight changes w/ the PLRM
staff, altho we do plan on keeping all our distributors (in
cleveland, chicago, louisville, pittsburgh, st.louis, milwaukee,
boston, philadelphia, knoxville, lexington, and cincinnati 
respectfully). it's still a small zine but that's the way we'd
like to keep it (it keeps our attitudes down). but as for the
changes here they are:

* star in chicago is doing most of the organizing now, i am still
  overseeing it tho, offering parental advice if u will.
* he is being assisted by the ever lovely kate O+ (the girl that
  really stood up & spoke her feminine mind during the massive
  cover debates) formerly of cleveland now residing in chi-town.
* he is also being assisted by one jay busch in louisville - our
  southern connection & low key technical genius.
* the rest of 'the staff' that i like to refer to as the 'family
  of light' got so big that we had to start up our own mailing
  list. oh btw if u'd like to get involved in our li'l zine feel     
  free to subscribe to the plrm mailing list by e-mailing:
  star@interaccess.com and he'll hook u up.
* this issue is looking purdy good w/ some very titilating features
  we're working on...     
  
  o ben dj cylert (st.louis sly dawg) will be interviewing dj devil 
    girl from st.louis.
  o spike (baltimore sly cutie) w/ some assistance from sarahS  
    (ne-raves roadtrip queen) will be interviewing patrick of
    phat-o productions.
  o stevie t (i dunno who this guy is) will be interviewing some
    yet to be named up & coming jungle dj.
  o dj kell (kentucky fried chicken) is also submitting some thoughts
  o and rumor has it that even ed luna (ele mental mentality) will  
    be dropping a few intelligent words.
  o as for the rest o da stuff, welp i dunno, i guess we'll see...
    but as usual there'll be neat-o pics from various partys all
    over the northeast & midwest, rave calendar, rave reviews, etc. etc.

but oooh yeah the reason i'm writing anywaze...i just wanted to 
announce there are a few ad spaces left in the upcoming zine, so
if yur a record store owner, throwin a party comin up, a music  
producer that has some new stuff coming out, or just a no name
joe that wanted to see themselves in print...get yur stuff in PLRM!
our rates are dirt cheap, we'll hit yur target market (our        
distributors are all ravers that go to partys), and we have a
very friendly staff (composed mostly of kids from mw-raves,
ne-raves, and pb-cle-raves that got sick of just talking about
stuff and actually did something). ooh yah one more thingy...
yur ad will also be displayed on our on-line version of PLRM also!
so e-mail either myself (syt@po.cwru.edu) or gill (star@interaccess.com)
if u want some more information concerning advertising in PLRM.

thank u for yur time & bandwidth...

Joe what you neglected  to state is that every single party psychoactive has
thrown or deep has roclked. I personally can attest to this. Anyhow alot of
those dj's you were completley wrong about . Obviously some of what you talke
you know nothing about.

Friday, April 19, a wonderful person named Antoinette is doing an 
installation piece called "Frequency" on the 
effect of technology, electronic music, and substances on human movement.

Basically she's throwing a party as art. :)

Should be mad interesting, with good djs (Johnny Blista, Smoov, Ruffian, 
Sine, and possibly 1 or 2 others). It's only 2 bucks, from 8pm-12am at 
the REA Coffeehouse on the Chatham College campus in pgh.  Definitely show 
up if you can.  There will soon be a little installation web site...

love and vine ripened tomatoes,
s

ps-is the name "Machete" taken by someone...a dj or somebody?  Sounds 
familiar...

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

Friday, April 19, a wonderful person named Antoinette is doing an 
installation piece called "Frequency" on the 
effect of technology, electronic music, and substances on human movement.

Basically she's throwing a party as art. :)

Should be mad interesting, with good djs (Johnny Blista, Smoov, Ruffian, 
Sine, and possibly 1 or 2 others). It's only 2 bucks, from 8pm-12am at 
the REA Coffeehouse on the Chatham College campus in pgh.  Definitely 
show up if you can.  There will soon be a little installation web site...

one two one 2, check it...

on april 20th 1996 "420" will unite the midwest tribes in an
event that will shake the very foundation of our culture. 
presented by cleveland's own psychoactive and spawntaneous,
420 will ignite a three day weekend long gathering of exponential
proportions compared to nothing you've ever seen. beginning
on friday, with the "420" preparty - "419" we'll bring together
some of the ohio heavies as columbus' own dj's doughboy and
kevy kev along with cleveland's own underground heros: dreamer,
pulse, & mike sparxx, kick this shit into high gear early. this 
will be the meeting ground..."ground zero". if you will, with the
promise of more to come, friday rolls right into saturday and after
a short rest (maybe) and a quick snack (probably) you'll find
yourself seemingly right back where you started - then the bomb
drops...you are submerged as 420 dome incases you inside of its
dubtribal, ectomorphic warp bubble and transports you via digital
direct audio and visual feeds across folded space. time and physics
cease, matter and anti-matter collide and you're dropped into the
3 room core chamber with derrick may, stacie pullen, robert armani,
john acquaviva, dj spun, carlos, feelgood, dj who, rob paine, 
astroboy, baggadonuts, rob sherwood & mike filly, gank and release.
just then, the thundering public address, which holds your very
heart in its hands. extends it's control by engaging the live acts:
dub tribe, ectomorph, the legion of green men / alkahest, tripper
information system and chris pulse. all of this compiled with an
unrelenting, all intelligent lightstorm, and laser cannons bad
enough to take down luke skywalker. you leave breathless...but
that's when you have to prepare for the afterparty..."421" brings
you back with dieselboy, doc martin, psychoactive's sleepy c and
o'keefe. all spaces are confirmed. all flights are booked. the
trandimensional migration will commence. come to cleveland ready
to turn over your soul to the hype which we are addicted. your
experience will never die.

will be passing a Photoshop file back and forth updating and tweaking it 
until it is perfect.  if you would like a peek at this, you will be able 
to download a copy of a recent version from the website 
(http://cat.net/~plrm) starting about saturday or sunday of the upcoming 
week.  for those interested in webpage design, stay in touch with stephan 
(sulivan@dazed.ddv.com) as he will be  heading up that project as we near 
completion of the hardcopy.  if you're intersted in writing or drawing or 
have some general good ideas stay in touch with this list, myself, and 
stevie-t.  if you really see local distribution of this magazine in your 
future, stay in touch with kate (krc@nwu.edu).

well, paul johnson never showed up and i bet some people out there will
say: "ele mental says one thing and does another.  they are full of shit." 
ok, while that may be true on an occasion or two, in this case it was out
of our control.  that's all i can say at this point. 

but anyone who has the audacity to complain, i'll friggin give your damn 
money back.  oh gee, $6.  i'll give you your $6 back and give nothing to 
all the people who helped me, donated equipment, and played for free.  
bowl-sheeit!!  hee hee...

anyway, i dont wanna sound negative, just thought id mention this coz i
can just imagine people complaining.  sorry, next party we do will be
free, ok?  seems that people forget how much work is involved in doing a 
party, with precious little reward.  for example in this case it looks 
like i broke even.  but did i?  all the hours i should have been at work, 
all the things i didnt add up, and im definitely still in the red.  so as 
i keep saying: PROMOTING AINT GLAMOROUS.  it seems like not much to ask 
for someone to show up and gladly pay their contribution to ensure more 
parties in the future.  apparently people dont think like that.

if every event was as poorly attended as ENERGIZE was, for example, we
wouldnt have a scene, y'all.  we make the scene, and we breathe life into
it. 

sorry, i'm still up after the event so pardon the rambling...

about the actual party, lemme just say:  kevy kev surprised the hell out
of me.  i mean i know he can spin but what surprised me is how he got the
crowd moving.  mad props. 

also: one sentence for ya - blendr is rad.  

the live acts had problems but no one that wasnt there would care to hear 
about it, so i'll say something more general about it.  i'd like to thank 
powerhouse, placebo, and lo.tek for dragging all their equipment out of 
their houses to play for free.  it's a hell of a lot for me to ask but i 
guess it says something to me that they do it so willingly.  so again, 
mad props, despite the glitches.

thanks to chuck who let us use his space, with some risk, and i hope his 
faith in us was well-deserved.

a lot of people helped, actually.  that's what makes a party.  

damn, i could go on but i better save it for a more serious post.

stay tuned for some more shit from me, a lot of thoughts are beginning to 
coagulate in this here noggin.  stuff about parties, promoters, music, 
etc.  you may find it interesting.  but those in the know will probably 
just nod their heads :)

now i gotta sleep and recover in time for PLUSH *raises fist*...

When I was involved with UPS in Akron, Ohio we did a party called
Deliverance with Paul Johnson who did not show up or call so this isn't a
first.

i cant believe i'm up this early, only 3 hrs of sleep, but oh well!!

i'll choose to do an atypical review and just mention a coupla things.

$17 cover was a bit steep...shoulda been $15 IMHO.  then again some
cleveland events with weaker lineups have been $20 so i guess it's all
relative.  i cant complain because for once ele mental was on the guest 
list!!  wow!  but just so y'all know i still paid $10 at 2AM (so THERE :)

my fun was had in the small upper room.  that's where terry repp aka trepp
blew my mind.  detroit, hard, fast, funky, bleepy, doin tricks...sheeit. 
book this man!!  he he.  then stretch from miami U was kickin some sweet
smooth diva house, then melloman dropped in the basic channel megamix and
all types of smooth house...*whew*.  i became a spontaneous
speaker-hugger. 

a couple general comments:  the main room sound sucked, partly coz of 
acoustics i guess, and this made it hard for the djs (whose faces were 
hard to see because of the lighting rig right behind them).  oh well, i 
think d. wynn still rocked the hardest, bouncing along and droppin it in.

the sound in the jungle/ambient room (is that a combo or what?) was way
too loud, it should have been more of a hangout area not yet another dance
area.  timbient did some nice ambient to close off, tho, so that's cool. 

lessee...oh yes, mad props to justus for another great slam.  it wasnt an 
ideal situation, but i respect their taste in music and the tightness of 
their vibe.  it's strong from them, so expect nothing if not good, honest 
events from these hard-working ravers :)

and btw, any rumors you've heard about "the illuminators vs. justus" is 
absolute bullshit.  sure, there are aesthetic differences of course, but 
so it goes.  i still hate slo-breaks, does that make me an evil person?!?!

hee hee

important to her, if you found it or know someone who found it PLEASE
mail me back or just send it to her:

Nia Bang

just wanted to announce that Carlos will be spinning at 420.
the rumor that he had to be at a wedding wuz wack! in fact
it wuz Carlos's Hotel room we crashed at after Mars (this 
wuz the reason u couldn't find me tom/waterzooi). it wuz a
good thing too cuz i wuz so dead after that party. i drove a  
total of 21 hours this past weekend (2.5 hours to columbus
to go to see paul johnson who ended up not showing & pick up
liz, 2.5 hours from columbus to cleveland to pick up chris
& his girl of spawntaneous, 8 hours from cleveland to syracuse
(i have to drive the speed limit cuz one more speeding ticket
& i lose my license), 8 hours from syracuse back to cleveland
to drop off chris & his girl so they can fly to san fran to
visit Carlos & the rest of the west coast dj's, 2.5 hours from
cleveland to columbus to drop off liz so she can go to school
next morning, and 2.5 hours from columbus back to cleveland.
now i know what Patrick meant when he said he felt like a zombie
after driving around everywhere promoting for Mars at SarahS's.
btw SarahS if yur the RoadTrip Girl, i think i have definitely
earned the title of RoadTrip Boy w/ a trip to Syracuse, Toronto,
and Dayton all within the past three weeks.

ok lessee what else Stephen said...ok contrary to some of the
other wack ass rumors i've been hearing, the space is secured.
it's in east cleveland and lemme tell u it's HUUUGE! and it's
a REAL warehouse space. i know where it's at, but can't tell u. 
all the permits have been signed (one by the mayor himself).
everything is legal and there will be hired security there to
ensure everybody's safety.

Turbosound and Thunder and Lighting are starting their set-ups
TOMORROW - five days before the party!

Stephen and the rest of the crew have been losing much sleep
to ensure that this party will be THE BOMB! after all he's
got everything he's ever made riding on it. which is exactly
why people like me are doing our best to help him out. i think
kids forget that there are real people working their asses off
when they throw a party of this caliber. this is not some small
house party. this is a major production that has been planned
for months with alot of money and alot of energy put into it
by alot of people.

And with many major productions there have been some really
wack ass rumors that have arisen surrounding this party. i've
even heard some of the bull shit that was started about me 
simply becuz i've been helping stephen out becuz he's my 
friend. alls i can say is DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THIS SHIT?
and to hear that kids in dayton have gone so far as to literally
piss on the 420 flyers! this is way wack! i've seen kids do
some pretty immature things and talk some serious shit, but i
think some kids in this scene really need to grow up.

Stephen also wanted to say that if you have any questions at 
all concerning the party you can reach him personally at Deep
Records at 216.382.3101.                   

oh yah one more thing as of today, the $20 tickets are sold
out in cleveland (the tickets are $25 in cleveland now).   
however you can still get $20 pre-sale tickets in columbus,
ohio at World Records.

what do you mean the 20$ tickets?  what we get "better seats" for the 25$
price?  or are they "pit tickets"?  interesting marketing move-good or bad,
i dunno?  well actually bad for me since i'm gonna be shelling out another
5$ for nothing.  i just have to wonder, there seems to be such a bad air to
the whole 420 thingy.

Since there will be many smart bar / bar / drink vending..it will be less 
confusing to have the Net meeting at :

Main Room , half way to the dance floor by the sound board. You can't miss it.

when : 1 am if it is ok with every one.

and..please no drink near the gear. thanks.


French E (i will hurt you that night...Bass in your stomack)

BTW...the light show will be hummmmm CRAZY. Surprises are waiting for you. and 
sound wize.....don't come in the main room with a full stomack..The 
Technosaurus system has just been doubled (twice the amps, twice the amount of 
speaker).

And come early..:)

=================================================================  

u silly jamie! all major partys have advance ticket prices cheaper
than day of/door prices - usually the pre-sale ticket money is used
for last minute day of party errands & expenses. plus it kinda
awards the people w/ enuff foresight to plan ahead (which is hardly
never the case w/ me) a slight discount, in this case five bones 
(dats five water bottles, half a mixed tape, or a tab in ravah 
language). the bad air is chris's boxers, which he hasn't changed
since Mars & is prolly sportin the same pair in san fran w/ Carlos
right now. either that or the stench from the 420 flyers that were
urinated upon in dayton! naw actually the extra five bux goes to the
live glass blowing dude ;)

The first 420 tickets sold were $20, all the rest are $25, there's no
difference in the ticket - just a $5 discount for buying a ticket early.

420 is STRAIGHT UP.

spawntaneuos has done very little for this event except lots o legwork 
and hooked up a space.  sleepy-c aka steve cinch has done 90% of the 
work!  so you know it's straight, no drug money, no shadiness, no bullshit.

steve currently needs about 2500 people to attend his event, to even come 
close to breaking even.  he's taking a tremendous risk to throw a 
once-in-a-lifetime event.  question is, are WE going to support him?  or 
are we going to let some stupid rumors from some jealous or shit-talking kids
(and no i'm not talking about the people throwing BASSRUSH) keep us from 
going to an amazing event?

to squelch the rumors once and for all:

- derrick may has shown his true colors by dissing the mw in favor of a 
  more lucrative gig in japan.  in the interest of keeping up a good 
  relationship, JUAN ATKINS, the godfather of techno, is taking his place.
  steve had NO CONTROL ofer this, as derrick was double-booked.  but juan 
  will bring his great presence to 420, on his wife's birthday even.

- carlos is CONFIRMED, as has already been well-established.

- there is no drug money involved in this party.

- there are no ill vibes between 420 and BASSRUSH, it's pretty clear that 
  both events are catering to totally different crowds.  look at the 
  lineups!

- the space is CONFIRMED CONFIRMED CONFIRMED, i can even tell you it's on 
  ivanhoe rd just 15 minutes from downtown cleveland.  3 phat-ass rooms 
  with 80-foot ceilings, etc...

- finally, steve will probably not make a dime on this event.

so there...any more questions?

of partying and 32 dj's/live acts. but here's a secret: go to
Deep Records and get'em for $25 the day of becuz the party is
only about 10 miles northeast of Deep Records, but yur not
s'posed to know that yet.

Just a quick comment on this part.  Steve and I spent some time talking on

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished

   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can

Sat Apr 20                        FREQUENCY                    Pittsburgh

Friday, April 19, a wonderful person named Antoinette is doing an 
installation piece called "Frequency" on the 
effect of technology, electronic music, and substances on human movement.

Basically she's throwing a party as art. :)

Should be mad interesting, with good djs (Johnny Blista, Smoov, Ruffian, 
Sine, and possibly 1 or 2 others). It's only 2 bucks, from 8pm-12am at 
the REA Coffeehouse on the Chatham College campus in pgh.  Definitely 
show up if you can.  There will soon be a little installation web site...

one two one 2, check it...

on april 20th 1996 "420" will unite the midwest tribes in an
event that will shake the very foundation of our culture. 
presented by cleveland's own psychoactive and spawntaneous,
420 will ignite a three day weekend long gathering of exponential
proportions compared to nothing you've ever seen. beginning
on friday, with the "420" preparty - "419" we'll bring together
some of the ohio heavies as columbus' own dj's doughboy and
kevy kev along with cleveland's own underground heros: dreamer,
pulse, & mike sparxx, kick this shit into high gear early. this 
will be the meeting ground..."ground zero". if you will, with the
promise of more to come, friday rolls right into saturday and after
a short rest (maybe) and a quick snack (probably) you'll find
yourself seemingly right back where you started - then the bomb
drops...you are submerged as 420 dome incases you inside of its
dubtribal, ectomorphic warp bubble and transports you via digital
direct audio and visual feeds across folded space. time and physics
cease, matter and anti-matter collide and you're dropped into the
3 room core chamber with derrick may, stacie pullen, robert armani,
john acquaviva, dj spun, carlos, feelgood, dj who, rob paine, 
astroboy, baggadonuts, rob sherwood & mike filly, gank and release.
just then, the thundering public address, which holds your very
heart in its hands. extends it's control by engaging the live acts:
dub tribe, ectomorph, the legion of green men / alkahest, tripper
information system and chris pulse. all of this compiled with an
unrelenting, all intelligent lightstorm, and laser cannons bad
enough to take down luke skywalker. you leave breathless...but
that's when you have to prepare for the afterparty..."421" brings
you back with dieselboy, doc martin, psychoactive's sleepy c and
o'keefe. all spaces are confirmed. all flights are booked. the
trandimensional migration will commence. come to cleveland ready
to turn over your soul to the hype which we are addicted. your
experience will never die.

I am from Pittsburgh, right now I am going to school at Ithaca College in 
NY. Judging by the amount of information that has been posted about 
Pittsburgh and their parties I would assume that NOTHING IS GOING ON in 
Pittsburgh. I know there are weekly events, however the only reason I know 
that is because I live there. Come on Pittsburgh there are a large 
percentage of influential people on the Internet that would probably be 
interested in what we have to offer. Pittsburgh is not using all of their 
available resources. So here's the question... what is happening in 
Pittsburgh? I'm sure other people than myself would surely like to know.

Well Rick, I for one am glad you asked this question.  Mainly because
I am only 45 minutes from downtown and _I_ have the same question as
you! Yeah, theres these almost weekly mostly WACK little get togethers
at Club Joy.  Whats that? Well, Club Joy is this TINY little space on
the third floor of a noodle bar.  Let me say, the "party" I went to
there was NOT underground, NOT a rave, and really barely felt like a
club even.  The music was ok, the jungle was the best, the vibe
was lacking , and the people were showing off... Which SUCKS imho.  When the
scene starts breaking down into tricky show offy djs and break
circles, well, thats when I say "plbbbbbt" and stick out my tongue... 
As for parties, I heard "Wonderland" was pretty fun, but I know there
were questions as to the legitmacy of the promoters (don't know who it
was, just heard rumors) and the fact that Carlos was a no-show
definitely says something kinda oogy... The Sunshine Kids parties have
been ROCKIN' nuff said.  UDG. threw a party last weekend that I
unfortunately couldn't attend, but I heard it was sparsely populated
and that the lights weren't "all that."  One thing Pittsburgh seems to
be VERY afraid of lately is bringing outside talent in.  I mean come
on, yeah we've got some OK DJ's in Pittsburgh, but geeez oh man, could
we STOP HAVING THE SAME ONES AT EVERY PARTY!? I'd really like to see
some bigger names come into town.  I mean, I'm all for supporting the
local scene, but IMHO the local scene cannot be ISOLATED from the rest
of the world, which it seems to be lately.  People keep talking about
how this is gonna be the "summer of love" or something... Well,
gangstas, weak spaces, redundant dj's with stale sets, LAZY promoters
out to make dollars, and cracked out kids DO NOT MAKE OUR SCENE GOOD.
Promoters, get your bums in gear and do something SUPER MEGA SPECIAL,
even if it is underground it can be FUN.  If its "commercial" its
gotta be done 500% better than its being done now.  Absolutely.  I
think good things can happen in Pittsburgh... maybe... :) Peace, Love,
Unity, and Respect  -Count Zer0

    Straight up, Count.

    Outside talent is DEFINITELY needed - it seems real cliquey right
now.  I remember at Perpetual Motion the best thing was Thee-o's hard
trance set, everyone loved it, and where is he now?

    Not to mention that Josh Wink's in Philly, not too far from here.

    More sunshine kids...

--snip--

preach on brother ZerO!
i couldn't have said it better myself.
now, i know i'm no big shot in the scene, and my opinion may not matter much,
but i have to say that because i'm restricted to the pittsburgh area (all i can 
attend are pittsburgh parties), my feelings and care for THIS scene are slowly
deminishing.  i find my self "less excited" to go to parties anymore.
why?  well, because i'm not having the same amount of fun anymore.  why?
because it's the same darn thing EVERY time.  i know what alot of you are 
saying, "well, the music hasn't changed.  the vibe is still there, you just
gotta
find it."  i'm sorry but the music HAS changed.  i'm tired of hearing the same
stuff every other weekend.  what ever happened to variety here?  there's so much
going on in electronic music today, and unfortuanately, most pittsburghers are 
limited to the common, house, jungle, acid rave experience.  please...i want
more!
and as to the vibe...well, it may be there, but DAMN IT, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO LOOK FOR IT!   do you hear me?  IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE FOUND!!!!!
that's  the problem.  somethin' big better happen this summer, or i'll be a
gonner.
excuse me now while i kiss the sky as i listen to some HAPPY HARDCORE (ever hear
of that?  thought not.)

love,                      p.s.-  please flame me for this.  i like it.

You gotta have parties where you can find space.  Club Joy may be a 
little different as far as the layout is concerned, but the times I've 
gone, there have been plenty of people there, it's just that most of them 
seem to hang out in the back of the room or in the bathrooms.  The dance 
floor is small and the vibe dilutes the further you get from the DJ 
booth, but come on ... it doesn't suck!

but of course!  Jungle *is* the best :-)

People were showing off?  What's that mean?

What's wrong with breaking and showing off some skills on the floor?  Not 
everyone can break, but that doesn't mean that those who can should not.  
As far as DJs go, yeah beat matching is smooth and all that, but 
scratching and backspins are what really show off a DJs skills.

UDG does put on some nice events.  Jungle Warfare was a nice turn out.  
But it seems that UDG has it's own group of DJs that they like to promote 
and other than that, at a UDG party, you're not likely to get any local 
DJs other than those hyped by UDG.  This is their perogative since 
they're the ones organizing the events, it's just that if you go to Club 
Joy and Protokulture all the time, of course you're going to see the same 
DJs every time because UDG is running the show, so there will be mostly 
UDG artists.  (How's that for circular logic?)

> how this is gonna be the "summer of love" or something...

Let's hope not.  Who needs some rehashed '60's ideals?

> Absolutely.  I

Of course they can.  Prices need to stay below $10 and flyers need to be 
correct and announce CONFIRMED DJs.  We're a little isolated out here on 
the far side of the mountains, but that doesn't mean that our community 
has to be restricted to Western PA / Tri-State area.  I would love to see 
some bigger names at Pittsburgh events, but it's going to be difficult to 
get crowds to come to Pittsburgh solely due to geographical location.  
Keep supporting the local scene and try throwin some underground parties 
in the style that you would like them to be.

respect,
Toby

Thanks for all your replys.
I want to tell the rest of you that i've already got well more than 50
mails regarding the _beverage_ promo-cd which means that we don't have any
more. All that were in time will get personal mail from me telling them
that they'll receive the promo.
Thanks again >> Daggan

B4 you read this, please understand that I realize this post sounds 
preachy. But finals and no sleep last night have my brain tied in knots.  
please forgive...

I agree with Tea. (wassup, pts'ster?) Although nothing beats that 
lost-in-an-ocean-of-sound-and-vibe feeling of a big party, little ones 
can be the glue that keeps things together in between. Plus, when I'm 
living on beans and rice, I can't shell out $20 twice/weekend to dance to 
the same (+/-) phat (+/+) music that I can get for $5. although, as a 
youngen' 
(and a socialist libertarian--figure that one out) I don't like the 
over-21 trend in Pgh for club events that sound good (Supa C's stuff, Bas 
Kulture...)

As for break cirlcles, I love 'em. It's not for everybody, but it is fun 
to watch, and the people breaking are obviously having fun. And it keeps 
the scene in touch with the hip hop side of the ancestry. It's like a 
skill/art passed down through generations. Youth subcultures, oral 
traditions, I think it's beautiful.  Roots 
are good. Especially ruddabegas (sp). 

As far as showing skillz (or "showing off") 
dancing or spinning, hell, why not? Would it be any fun if everyone held 
back from doing what was in their souls (or egos or eggos or whatever) for
fear of 
offending someone? That doesn't move anything forward. Lights under 
bushels at parties? gawd, I hope not.

Hipper than thou attitudes are what to say 
> "plbbbbbt" 
to. But it goes both ways. Showing off to prove you're better sucks, but 
so does trying to enforce a laid back calm. Some people like to get out 
there...if you sqelch that, you're just another indie elitist. (Not U 
personally, Count. :)
 
> "summer of love" or something... 

Although "summer of love" is a bit cheesy and derivative (reminiscent of 
that whole Zippies fiasco), I like to think things will blow up this 
summer.  I've heard wonderful plans.... :)

> gangstas, weak spaces, redundant dj's with stale sets, LAZY promoters
> out to make dollars, 

Are you sure that's a fair criticism?

> and cracked out kids DO NOT MAKE OUR SCENE GOOD.

BTW, I'm not sqeaky clean, but I think I've decided not even to take 
Vivarin at parties anymore. At Protokulture 3 (tingly with effedrine) I 
realized that E is a "grandfalloon"...read Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut 
(sp?) or write me for a quick explanation.

Also, every complaint/*constructive* criticism (b/c I know (hope?) there 
wouldn't be any other kind----jeez, I should like a kindergarten 
teacher...) must be backed up with a solid effort if the critics want to 
be respected. Again, this isn't a personal attack...for all I know you're 
the biggest contributor to the pgh-cle scene. 

> :) Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect  

Yep! We gotta push for quality *EXACTLY AS MUCH* as we push for 
plur to keep the scene real, as in, a group of people who are friends  
unless proven enemies, imh(and exhausted)o. 
:/

peace and a blanky,
evita guevara

Just curious...
Seems there's a lot of posts on this lists from the mismatched chromosome

How many females are there?

I TOTALLY disagree with this.  Pittsburgh is within 6 hours of EVERY
MAJOR CITY ('cept Boston maybe) in the Northeastern U.S.!  NYC = 6
hours, Philly = 6 hours, Baltimore (the u.s rave capital? ;) = 4
hours, Syracuse = 6 hours, Cleveland =  3 hours, Columbus = 3 hours,
Toronto = 4 hours, D.C. = 5 hours.  

IF WE CAN DRIVE ALL THOSE HOURS, TAKE BUSES AND VANS ALL THAT
DISTANCE, THEN DAMNIT WHY CAN'T ALLLLL THOSE PEOPLE COME HERE!!!!!??? 

sorry to yell... just kinda riled up right now... :)

> getting a little tired of parties...and won't really come out unless it

there aren't any special occasions thats my whole point.

right on!

Now, again, I ask, how does one make the scene better?

yeah, small dancefloors, diluted vibe, druggers in the bafrooms, yeah,
i can see how you say that doesn't suck... WHAT!????  Can we say,
"This ain't a rave pardner!" I think we can... Do you realize that
there are 16 year old girls and boys going home and telling mommy and
daddy that they are going to a "RAVE" and ending up at Club Joy that
evening!? Then they get offered K and Crystal, and hang out in the
bathrooms and don't learn anything about the MUSIC or the true rave
culture!?  THATS A PROBLEM. :)


> > the vibe

> 
> People were showing off?  What's that mean?  

it means rather than hugging and dancing and yelling and screaming
because of the FUN TIME they are having, people are forming break
circles and showing off their "skills" and worshipping djs and being
generally nasty and exclusive... THATS what I mean by showing off...

Well, I'd have to disagree... In my opinion, breakdancing does not
belong at a rave.  Raves are not about showing off and trying to look
better than other people.  Raves are about peace, love, unity and
respect.  And we are talking about raves here aren't we?  This is the
PB-CLe RAVES list isn't it?  :) 

> As far as DJs go, yeah beat matching is smooth and all that, but 
> scratching and backspins are what really show off a DJs skills.  

Scratching and backspins DO NOT TAKE PRECEDENCE over keeping a STEADY
DANCEABLE BEAT.  I am not dissing DJS who can scratch and do slick
tricks, I am dissing those DJS who do them POORLY and do not keep a
flow to the beat... Again, the MUSIC is the KEY and the music at a
rave is supposed to be continuous, fluid and danceable. :)

Yes, I understand that :) Doesn't mean I agree with it or don't think
someone should do something to counter it :)

Peace, Love, Unity and Respect = rehashed '60's ideals.  YUP 
And damnit if they didn't work the first time, DON'T WE HAVE THE
CHANCE TO MAKE THEM WORK THIS TIME!!!??? :) We should have that
chance, and we DO.

see my reply to Chris White's post regarding DISTANCE and TRAVEL. This

>to watch, and the people breaking are obviously having fun.

yes, breakdancing is all fine and dandy...in a warehouse.
it is not appropriate at a small club like club joy.  the floor is hardly 
big enough to stand, let alone dance.  the problem is that most (i said "most") 
breakdancers have no consideration to those around them.  i've been pushed,
nudged, and kicked more times than i can count.  
as for dj's scratching and playing around, well if it can be done
with a moderate amount of accuracy (supa-c listen here...) then it's ok.
but i find that a dj who does a dozen tricks DOES NOT help me to enjoy 
myself any better.  i'd much rather here someone play an unmixed cd compilation
than here the word "bass" scratched 50 times over.
i'm not being negative just for the sake of negativity.  and i hate to only 
post something when it's non-positive, but i'm just getting
quite disappointed in what is happening here.
here is a thought to ponder.  it's a quote by an unnamed dude,
"the second that techno was removed from the scene, the rave movement died."
comments?

love,
ryu

I've had a freaky feeling all day, and so have other people.  What ever 
you do this weekend, especially tongiht (friday) if you happen to read 
this, please, please, PLEASE be careful b/c I have really bad 
feelings....bad enough that I left a party after half an hour and am 
sleeping on a couch at Pitt's radio station.  Weird stuff is happening at 
my house too...

Whatever.  
have a fun weekend.

direx to 420: 

(sorry so late, but steve's been really busy)

from any direction,
use a map and get in the general area of north eastern
ohio. find route 90. take 90 E or 90 W towards downtown
cleveland. you will exit route 90 at east 152 st which
is exit #180B. go south on 152 st. for about 3/4 mile.
you will come to a big intersection, there is a school
and a marathon gas station there. look for ivanhoe rd.
ivanhoe will be the road that is slightly to your left.
follow ivanhoe rd for about 1/3 mile. look on right
for the atlas building. this is it!! the address is
1140 ivanhoe. see ya there! peace!


direx to the net ravahs pre-party @ jeff/stuff's new pad    
mentor ohio:

from any direction,
use a map and get in the general area of north eastern
ohio. find route 90. take 90 E or 90 W towards downtown
cleveland. take rt 2 East (1.5 miles west of 271). get
off at rt 615. left at exit. go 1-2 miles. left on
quail pt. lane. the address is 8340 quail pt. lane.
i think it's the 4th house on the left. white w/ shutters.

party starts in the afternoon and will go on 'til 10pm.

dj's spinning at the party:
* dj stuff (jeff) - techno / trance
* dj aron - jungle
* dj jinx - hop hop / house
* titonton may be spinning on sunday when he crashes there.

oh yah checked the weather, things are looking much better
tonight. still some showers. but the rest should be all
good. i think last night wuz the worst of it. i wuz talkin
to some kids from chicago at the pre-party & they said the
storm followed them the whole way there. chicago, st.louis,
& indianapolis got rocked. 30 tornados in that region - a
new midwest record for one night. astroboy called home to
check if his house wuz still there. alls i can say wuz that
it provided for some mad visuals last night outside at the
pre-party. its just natures way of reminding of us of who's
really boss i guess.

peace & take care...

worrying about 420, I for one would sure as hell like to know what
those who attended thought.  :) Reviews?

God it was a long day for me.

A crew of 14 people took 10 hours to set up the 3 sound systems and the 
lights. Yes, the Palace is a very beautiful theater. really beautiful.

The main room : We set up 16 stacks. We put up a row of 8 Intellabeams on the 
top of the speakers with 4 Emulators. The flew 8 Cyberlights, 2 Godlights one 
24" mirror ball and 2 8*650 bright lights. The flow gear was moving up and 
down....Very nice effect...especially the back drops (silver and gold)

The second room had 8 mini ultra scan 200 msd and 4 stacks.

Third room had 6 stacks that keep moving every where because of the massive 
amount generated by the records.

Spice Lab  ...Olive Lieb...what a picky s.o.a.b. A Rave is not a recording 
studio. He was a pain in the ass to deal with. He put me is a really bad mood. 
I was ready to tell him to F---- off, but I stayed professional and dealt with 
him. Sorry for the language but that is what I have to say about him. He 
played really well.

Scott Forbush played hard...I mean hard....very good set. 

Dougal. oh my god...kicked my ass..I wished at that time I was not working so 
I could have gone dance.

Frankie Bones did a good set.....

Basically, every DJ kicked some serious ass. I think this was an even not to 
miss.

Chip from Eyegasm did the best lighting show I have ever seen in my entire 
live. All the cue for the light going from 80 ft up in the ceiling all the way 
down above people's head was amazing. 

I was really pissed of at the security. They were very unprofessional. At the 
end, I almost got kicked out, because I changed my clothes to break down the 
gear and did not have my pass. They kicked out people for no reasons. Those 
cops really sucked. I really wished we could have used our regular security 
guys, but the Palace theater did not let Tim use them.

And the water deal was also uncool. I want to appologize to every once about 
that. This was beyond our control.

Also, sorry about the after party. Explanations will be posted later.

I think Bassrush was a very good event, if not the best this year.

Sure thing...
Personal Vibes:
	Well, I knew this was going to be my last party heading in.  Can 
you say?: Going out with a bang!.  Funny i was more nervous for this 
party than i was for my first.
	Heh Derrick May's replacement, Juan Atkins was spining when eric, 
other oberlin people and i strolled in.  I didnt miss May one bit! =)  
The only problem was, the Dj line up got messed around..so i had to ask 
who was spinning now and then.
	How good was the music? This was the only party in which I got 
leg cramps.  Danced as much as a could...but it eventually got to 
painfull.  
	Oh yeah Dub Tribe[8 am to 10 am]...KILLER....their live set 
really impressed me, almost as much as Neil Landsrumm's (=P eric).  
	Unfortunately the pre-party and other assorted activities 
fatigued me.  So i didnt say around for the after party..how-ever i think 
i heard Doc Martin spin a bit as I walked out.
	
Space:
	The area was huge..and dirty!  I woke up and found myself 
coughing up black dirt and such.[No wonder i was always looking for 
something to drink]  The price you pay for a killer party.  It took me 
two showers before I felt clean.  

Light:
	The main room lights were good, however the light in the House 
room were pretty weak.  And i only saw the jungle room two times, once as 
i walked into the party and the second time as i left, so i cant comment 
on them.

Music: 
	Like i said, made me dance. Dance so much that i had leg cramps 
for the first time.

People: 
	I know im fairly new to the 216 scene but i thought i saw a lot 
of new faces in addition to the old faces.  met someone who decicded to 
make 420 his first party.  Asked me some stupid questions, but hey it's 
all good.  Oh yeah met some people from Chicago too, i guess Dave Clarke 
having problems turned some Chi-ravers toward 420.   
	As usual, I saw Stevie T there....and i met Mike Allroy for the 
first time.  I mean i saw him at other parties, but never recoginzed 
him[I had to really strecth the imagination to see the the similiarties].
Hmm other than that i dont think i saw any one else on the list...oh well 
im a hermit anyways.


Overall 420 was one of the best parties i had the pleasure to go to.  
Well i guess you dont have to worry about me wasteing bandwith now...
Signing off ..forever and beyond

This party was nothing less than amazing.

The location:
the atlas warehouse complex - basically three HUGE warehouses all joined
together into one large complex.  It was perfect.  Yeah, it was dirty, but
thats all cool, i can remember worse places where the dirt was so bad that
they didn't even need fog machines to cloud up the air.  This place just
sorta aged with a nice layer of dirt on everything.  The only time it
bothered me was at the afterhours because then it was light out and the dirt
became all the more obvious, and i was feeling the urge to finally let myself
sit down and chill, and that floor was not such an appealing crash pad.  But
as i said, it was all cool.  Really the only criticism i could have of the
place was the lack of water.  I brought a huge bottle of water but the
problem was, once it was gone, there was nowhere to fill it up again.  i
survived though, there were many generous people with water to spare :)

The People:
i couldn't believe how many people were there!!!  It was amazing!  If anyone
on the list knows some sort of estimate as to how many people were there, id
love to know.  It really blew my mind.  I mean this huge three warehouse
complex was full!  To walk from one room to the adjacent room took a good
half an hour to get through the thick crowds.  Everywhere id turn would be
another familliar face and id stop and chat, remember i was headed for
someplace, move on and take two steps and run into more friends.  i couldn't
figure out why the time seemed to be passing so quickly :)  

Also, the crowd was really different then the usuall.  TONS of 1st time
ravers, TONS of people from out of town.  It was great.  Parties like this
build quite a reputation for our scene.  But at the same time i have to admit
that i could help but feel a tiny annoyance of my own snobishness.  It seemed
that between the vast quantities of people there and also the 1st time
raver's ignorance of what raves are about, sorta made the vibe suffer.  I
also think that the thick hectic crowd hovering around the port-o-poties put
a damper on the vibe as well.  It just seemed that there was a vibe goin in
the main room, and a vibe in the house room, but the two just were struggling
to come together with the dense block of shadiness in front of the portolets.
 i dont mean to put down any of those people who found themselves spending a
lot of time chillin at the port-o-poties, and i also dont mean to put down
anyones activities...i just love a great vibe and hated to see it be
hindered.  

but okay, im babbling...ill move on

The Music and Lights:
well, as usual i did not know what the lineups were in any of the rooms. :)
 i didn't really go in the jungle room much at all so i can't comment on
their music (i know their lights were phat though).  The main room's lights
were mind boggling, and the music was nothing less.  Between the house room
and the main room there was so much good music - i was in heaven.
 Unfortunately someone else will have to do the specific dj critique, because
i just appreciated amazing music and danced, i didn't really take the time to
acknoledge what dj i was appreciating at the time.

It really was an impressive party.  Thanks to all those who spent their time
organizing it!  Id have to say that may have been one of the best organized
raves ive experienced.  How so many people could be joined together in such a
perfect location with such an amazing line up amazes me.  im still in awe.  

lots of luv
leah

Huh?  There have been "druggers" at every rave I've ever been to.  Even 
big overblown full-on-flouresecnt-light raves like "Freee".  That doesn't 
effect my vibe one way or the other.  The vibe I'm talking about was up 
on the (limited) dancefloor jamming with the DJ.  The vibe was generated 
by good selections spun by creative DJs, regardless of what was going on 
in the back of the room or in the shadows.  Different types come to the 
scene for different reasons.

This is true, K and such does very little for an upbeat vibe, but those 
kids will learn on their own, regardless of what we or their parents tell 
them.  I hope that the typical party goer does not get swayed to the dark 
and comes to the floor to dance instead.  The party is about THE MUSIC, 
which is why I was there in the first place, fuck all the other 
distractions.

I did plenty of hugging, yelling, DANCING, pushed up the lighter and all 
that in the interest of getting the groove on.  I don't feel like I was 
showing off.  Besides, sometimes it's nice to ease back and watch some 
other really good dancers throw down.

and Dancing, of which breakDANCING is included.  You're right that it 
gets tricky sometimes in tight spaces, but tolerance is rewarded by free 
expression.

Of course, sucker DJs must get dissed.  The DJs with skill can 
scratch/backspin/and beatmatch all within time and keep the groove 
flowin.  Sometimes people fuck up, but that's the flavor of live 
entertainment.  In fact, a lot of the tracks I've bought (Jungle, mind 
you) have scratching and backspins mixed into the tracks, so obviously 
the creators of the music like to press their skills on wax, as if to 
fuel our fire.

I'm all for the ideals, just wish we could come up with a better catch 
phrase than "Summer of Love part 2".  How about "The Return of Good 
Vibrations" or "The Bride of Feeling Groovy". :-)

okay...time to jump in the mix.

i think Pittsburgh has one of the nicest scenes that i've ever seen (not
that i've made my worldwide tour or anything yet).  

1) on the commerciality of raves in Pittsburgh:  yes, i've had friends
of mine from school whom i would NEVER have expected to see at a rave go
to events in Pittsburgh.  but they did NOT come just for the drugs, i
saw them getting down with the rest of the "true" ravers (whatever that
is).  and when i think about it, none of them have been the type of
person that i _wouldn't_ want in the scene (if i was Scene-Master).  so,
what's wrong with an influx of new ravers?  i totally agree that the
younger kids (and older) who get into the scene and only see the drug
side need to be enlightened or something.  

2) i don't think the weekly Club Joy event is meant to be a "rave", just
a weekly event.  if you look on the ROM, we have a separate section for
weekly events...and DUB belongs there.

3) on break circles...i have heard this argument it seems 2 million
times.  yes, they take up space.  but they don't last forever (at least
not the one in question at Club Joy).  and we who get in the middle
aren't "showing off" mindlessly...it's OUR way of having fun, too!  i
think (in fact, i know) that the breakers and others who get in the
circle that I know do NOT go in with an attitude of "let me show this
dweeb what's going on".  and anybody is welcome in the circle.  ANYBODY.
 the only people that we circlers frown upon is those who just go in
there and hog for 20 minutes without letting anyone else in.  and
anybody who says "breaking doesn't belong at raves" and thinks they have
the PLUR is missing an "R"...if you Respected breaking you would know
that the attitude and "dissing" that you see is usually backed with
respect, and anyone who breaks (or anything) in a circle solely to diss
someone is considered wack by the rest of us.  at least that's been the
case with circles i've seen here.  i've been in circles (namely in
Philly/DC/Baltimore) where a few dancers have taken the circle and been
good, but not very nice to anyone who didn't meet their "standards" in
the circle.  not even a nod.  that's wack.

4) outside DJs:  maybe there's more reasons that we don't see for not
having so many outside DJs.  i mean, are promoters making enough here to
throw that "big bash" you're all clamoring for?  i think that all these
little things with local DJs are meant to provide money to eventually
build up to that BIG party...it takes a lotta moola for that kind of
thing...we had jungle warfare and superfresh not toooooo long ago, and i
know that at Jungle Warfare people came from all over...and superfresh
had Rob Paine, Scott Henry...maybe i'm in the Kool-Aid and don't know
the flavor, but that's what i think.

pitt.. by Count Zero@acad1.stvince 
> > every event cause the club scene here is wack and we love to dance...i
> 
> the club scene is wack... my point? YUP
> 

i think Chris was referring to the club scene as in Kong's, Club 19
(closed now), Club Vegas, and all the little 21+ singles club things
(Chaunceys, wherever else)...but the club scene in general is wack
because we don't have anywhere that's really ideal to have a
club...yeah, Joy is small.  if we could take over Kongs (!) we'd have a
mad phat space to have a "rave" club.  if i hit the lottery, i'll find,
no, i'll BUILD us a phat space to have events.  that's a promise!

howdy all. really havent participated much in
the discussion on the list, but everyone else
is putting in their two cents, thought it an ideal
time for me to spiel-off.

anyhow, i'm rather concerned about the semi-sorta-kinda-elitism
that's been coming up alot recently. (actually, i have
no idea if it is a recent development or not, i'm
rather a newbie.) I'm wondering if we can all agree that there
is not just one definite vibe throughout a party. From my
experiences, it seems to change from room to room 
(assuming there are multiple rooms.) I think some people
have been misinterpreting a change in "the vibe (tm)" as
a degredation. Particularly with respects to drugs. why all
the outright negativity towards drugs all of a sudden?
certainly i dont expect ppl to condone, promote or encourage
the use of drugs in anyway (being as they ARE illegal, and can
have serious repercussions in many ways,) but actively insulting
the people who are into them? with that, i cannot agree.
ive seen alot of mention about the old days,, the roots, etc etc.
well, drugs were an integral part of getting the rave thang
going, no? in fact, i believe them to be a foundation of sorts.
garcia & the old acid tests with kesey and all dat.
alas, i've taken a bit of a tangent. Beyond drugs,
many people have complained about the people chillin in the back,
bathrooms, whatevah. so what? let them chill. let them miss
out. i just dont see what the big deal is. do these druggies and/or lounging
ppl directly insult you in some unspoken way? maybe that's
just their thing (vibe). let them do their thing. and do yours.
just wish the shit-flinging would stop (and it's been pretty
one way so far.) 

well, there it tis. dunno if i explained myself too well.
all i know is i wanna hear some 420 stories :)
take care all,
len

Ok.  Comments on the recent conversations:
	
	1.) Problem: Unfocused negativity, pigeonholing 
	2.) Solution: Constructive criticism
	3.) Proposal: Discuss ways to build creative unity and tolerence

I'll explain.

1.)	People seem to think that there is a unified spirit of the 
scene.  Maybe there is.  But the details of people's individual idealisms 
tend to exclude (and dis) other people's.  So the point that dissing drug 
users ain't totally cool, is valid.  Dissing breakers and tricky djs for 
expressing and using their skills, I think is not valid.
	There has also been dubiousness as far as the "Summer of Love" 
thing.  One, people keep using the term and that's how terms get 
legitmized.  Do you think any 20soemthings actually chose to be called 
Gen X?  Two, it's derivative, plain and simple.  This is not the 60s, and 
ravers are not hippies.  This might sound hypocritical considering a few 
days ago I defended breaking as a bastion of hip hop roots.  
	But this is a different animal.  I don't think this scene needs 
to depend on dehydrated, time-capsuled philosophy to promote its 
asthetic.  (This sounds so academic...I'm sorry) See, this music had 
something to do with hip hop, elektra, Kraftwerk, you all know the 
story.  So appreciating where the art that has evolved originally came 
from, is a damn good idea.
	The philosophy of the scene can be compared to hippydom, but PLUR 
a lot more basic.  You could call it Christianity.  You could call it 
family values.  You could call it politeness.  
	You could call it the positive side of humanity.
	So subscribing to a 30-year social movement that was very 
different and doesn't mesh with a *whole lot* of ravers' world view is a 
bad idea.
	That's why I think Summer of Love is a disposable title.  And 
that's why trying to define the vibe by narrow definitions is very wack.  
There's a lot of unnecessary (and irrelevant andcounterproductive and 
childish and silly and elitist) dissing going on.
 
2.)	Which is why I think we'd be better served to simply think in a 
new direction.  Instead of deciding if drugs are good or if rewinding is 
bad, how about finding a way to include everything that is part of the 
"vibe" under one big roof, but giving disagreeing parties enough room to 
be observed and influenced but not bothered by each other?
	More concrete example: inter-genre bickering.  We all know that 
everything from house to jungle comes from essentially the same place and 
they share *a lot* of common ground.  Sequestering styles is dumb.  If 
you like one more than another, that's cool.  But don't close your mind 
to all the possibilities.  New styles are created every day by people who 
cross lines.
	So how do you create unity, preserve individuality, and put 
everything that's cool under that roof?  Who's to decide what's cool?  
Isn't that where the bickering begins?

3.)  	That's what I'd love to hear ideas about, so I'll throw in the 
first towel.
	It's difficult to come up with a unified unity.  This isn't a 
political movement--there's no official text to go to and look up the 
definition of "vibe".  But I have an idea of what everyone everywhere might 
agree on. How 'bout this:
	The heart and the vibe of the scene is being REAL. 
	Anyone who is being real, should not and CANNOT be dissed.  If 
you have a spiritual experience every time you explore your brain with 
chemicals, then be careful, get the most out of it, and share your 
findings.  If you love getting technical with your dancing or music, work 
on the details and again, share your progress.  Some people will like it 
and if they don't, no biggy.  Etc, etc, etc.
	And anyone who is real will Respect what's real in everybody else.

	This is a really simple summary of the tip of an iceburg of 
thought.  There's a lot of room for discussion...which is why you're 
here, right?

well, my point was that the newer ppl in the scene wouldn't really
know what a "real rave" is, especially if the only events they have
gone to have been club joy type things.  And i DISTINCTLY remember
reading something in the pittsburgh newspaper which referred to club
joy events as "raves."  SOOOO...

thats great Adam! :) I know you, and you have NEVER even began to give
me any sort of attitude :) You're a friend :) Now, how about the guy
who once said to me "You should move, yo!" when I was standing dancing
with my back to him when he was trying to break and didn't have enough
room...  Well, I guess there are bad apples in every bushel, eh?  And
I just generalized his vibe with the majority of breakers... Sorry...
that was my bad... Also, I still don't like the idea of catering to
the possibilty of this kinda vibe thing er whatever but I guess its
guys like you and Chris White and Farmer Tea who prove me wrong :) :)

I must say that my dissing of breaking (generalizations) were a little
on the disRespectful side, I apologize.  But still, I give no respect
to drugged out show-offy get out of my way types :) Sorry about that ;)

wooohooo!!! :) me too Adam! I'm all about (as they say) winning money
and spending it on raves :) ;) :)

Hope this has cleared some things up :) Hope nobody hates me :/ Cuz I

I can agree with that, yup. BUT, I'd have to say that FUN is one thing
we all expect to have at a party, and that NO ACTIVITY anyone takes
part in should interfere in any way with the FUN another person is
trying to have... Right? :)

because drugs are bad for you ;)

I never meant to insult anybody... BUT
I'm sorry but I have NO respect for people who don't have
respect for their own bodies, you have to know your limits.  I heard
that somebody od'ed at Club Joy last friday... Thats not very joyous
is it!? And, um, all I have to say is NO RESPECT! :P :)

Don't get me wrong though.  Safe experimentation with non physically
addicting substances is just peachy keen in my book :) JUST BE
CAREFUL.  

> ive seen alot of mention about the old days,, the roots, etc etc.
> well, drugs were an integral part of getting the rave thang
> going, no? in fact, i believe them to be a foundation of sorts.

drugs were a PART of raving just as they have always been a part of
life... BUT they are by no means the FOUNDATION of raving. DUH! Its
the MUSIC thats the foundation! :)

> garcia & the old acid tests with kesey and all dat.

yeah they were neato guys :) But I'm sure they'd agree that abuse of
ones body, neglect for other people and destructive behavior are all
nasty nasty things. :) 

> bathrooms, whatevah. so what? let them chill. let them miss

ahhhh chilling is such a wonderful thing :) but thats what CHILL ROOMS
should be for ;) not cracking out in the bathroom :P ;)

> out. i just dont see what the big deal is. do these druggies and/or lounging
> ppl directly insult you in some unspoken way? maybe that's

yup... they insult me by making me feel all icky about the human
condition.  They insult me by their lack of respect for their bodies
and their friends, lovers, families who they are hurting by killing
themselves...  

Also, there is NOTHING WRONG WITH CHILLING OUT :) As amatter of fact i
thinkits just damn dandy :) Thats why I spin ambient ;)

Oh, yeah, one more thing, I CAN ignore the people who make me feel all
icky, but its not that easy, and it tends to put a damper on my fun,
not always, but sometimes...

Ok, peaz and luff and alll that jazz to the happy people :) -Count Zer0

first of all i didnt get to 420 until 5.30 AM (!!) but i STILL caught 
most of what i wanted to see, amazingly enough.  someone wanted an 
estimate on the amount of people: well, i think it hit about 4000 
attendees, believe it or not.  i know there were over 2000 even when i 
got there so i believe it!

unfortunately, steve aka sleepy c lost over $10,000 throwing this event.  

huh?  

yep, steve lost over _$10,000_!!!

i got in free, so at one point i went up to steve and handed him a $20.
i know some of you that are reading this did not pay.  some people snuck 
in through the back door, etc.  if you are one of them, please be aware that
steve worked for two months on this event, and you are going to play him 
like that?  granted, no one ASKED him to throw this event, but imho 
anyone who can help steve get back on his feet should go to deep records 
this week and give him what you owe him or even a nice donation.  i mean, 
seriously...he could barely afford to buy himself a nice dinner after 
doing all that work FOR US!  give him props.

ok...enough of that...now, the usual "review" stuff:

i got there and waltzed into the jungle room where mike filly was actually
playing good stuff.  ran into titonton who informed me i didnt miss
ectomorph, so i was happy.  blah blah blah i spent some time getting
oriented and talking to people, then i caught ectomorph playing live.  it
was pretty disappointing, both brendan and gerald looked pretty
frustrated, as if nothing was going how they expected.  talking to brendan
(gillen) later, i found out that playing at such a big "rave" wasn't
something they really wanted to do again...and that their keyboards 'n'
stuff werent doing what they expected. 

apparently robert armani spun a short set before ectomorph, and before 
him was juan atkis who i heard was VERY good.  that's just for anyone 
keeping track.  armani spun a short set after ectomorph too (he was the 
lighter-skinned black guy wearing the reds cap :).  then came stacIE (hee 
hee) pullen whose set was ever too brief!  30 minutes was an insult to 
this man, whose smooth and beautiful mixing style never had a chance to 
build to its usual heights.  but i guess john aquaviva had been waiting 
to spin since like 2AM so he let him on.  it's still not fair, as john 
got to spin twice the amount of time that stacey did.  i guess i'm biased 
because i hate most of what john spins (and so does HE...he plays 
deliberately cheesy stuff, just ask him!).  i will say, however, that 
john did play about 50% good stuff (by good i mean non-cheesy, non-vocal- 
in-your-face music).  so the detroit contingent of ectomorph and stacey 
had kind of a rough night.

next up was dubtribe.  now, i'll say that last year i wanted to punch
their lead singer (sunshine?) at FAMILY AFFAIR because he went on this
hippy rant in the middle of their set that was _soooooo_ icky...everybody
cheering peace and love, only to throw attitude just like usual after the
music was over.  and dubtribe just _plays_ into this kind of hypocracy, no
matter if they themselves mean it or not.  ANYWAY, this time wasnt so bad,
and the ranting was kept to a minimum from what i could tell.  hee hee,
and of course during their set i still came into the crowd and yelled
"hippy shit!" once or twice just for that necessary dose of skepticism and
negativity that are needed in such moments (hey, i'm an urbanite, what 
can i say).

more importantly (and i'm glad they figured this one out), the MUSIC spoke
much better.  none of that wack-ass slo-breaks b.s...this was nice,
straightforward, hippy-tinged techno that really worked!  they must have
spent some time listening to some detroit techno or something ;).  i also
wanted to point out that the female singer (shit i forget her name...)
sung some beautiful indeterminate vocals, reminding me of the time i saw 
them live in san fran and liked them. 

but the real topper for me was ASTROBOY.  here we were in the 2nd room, 
it was already daylight, and me and most of the columbus cru were just 
_kickin it_ in there.  mad props to andy for gettin my ass to dance hard!

then came the afterhours somewhat later, with doc martin.  i stayed till 
about 1pm that afternoon and came home.

so...in a way it's not fair for me to judge this event overall, because i 
really wasnt there for most of it.  but i will say the same thing i told 
sleepy c himself: 

- the sound was way too bass-heavy, leaving nothing in the midrange to 
  grab onto.  

- the event seemed very disorganized...much more like a spawntaneous 
  event (har har).

- i would have felt disappointed if i had payed $30, even if i HAD gotten 
  there earlier.  for $30, one expects a fuckin CARNIVAL or something.

but, on the other hand, steve scored some MAJOR coups with this event:

- the biggest event EVER in cleveland, and maybe ohio (and almost the 
  midwest i bet!).

- a good event in cleveland, with a solid lineup and a nice flyer.  that 
  seems to be asking a lot from cleveburg.

- he got ME to go to a cleveland party...my 1st one since the 1st 
  REBIRTH in late 1994, woo woo!!  he he

a couple final comments and then i'm off...

i think that 420 just proved my point about big events: bigger is not 
better, bigger is only riskier.  as bad as i feel about steve's massive 
loss of funds, he KNEW what he was getting into.  i cant believe it takes 
this kind of lesson to get people to understand that BIG IS NOT 
NECESSARILY GOOD!  but i do think steve had a certain _agenda_ in 
mind...to bring together certain contingents of music and music-makers, 
and in that sense he succeeded.  but unfortunatley, like jj after 
INTERSTELLAR OUTBACK 2, steve's gonna be broke for months now.

if anyone out there is planning a party: take it from me, you dont need a
mindblowing lineup to have a good party.  get a couple headliners and some
local people, charge less, and dont bother flyering too far...concentrate
your promotion in nearby areas, especially on bringing new people in your 
own town into the scene, "ravers" or not.  that's the way to go. 

sad to say, too, that i bet only 1 out of 100 people ever even CONSIDERED 
the trouble steve and cru went through to do this event...most people's 
only thoughts were probably: "god those port-a-poddys suck,"  or "man, i'm 
peaking too early," or whatever.  i guess that's part & parcel to 
raves..._no one_ goes to raves because they feel they owe a promoter their 
support, or anything political like that.  people, myself included, go to 
raves to have FUN.

but i think we can do better than that.  we're only going to get to the
next level (whatever that means) if we WORK, not just sit back and be
"entertained." 

one last point:  someone left one of my "think" pamphlets laying on the
ground, after i personally handed it to them.  not that i expect everyone
to care about what _i_ care about, and not that that little pamphlet isnt
rife full of my own assumptions about things, but if you're not even going
to bother to read it, you SUCK.  and sad to say, all that shows is that
i've got an immensely long way to go to get my message out.  sure, a good
number of y'all have listened to what i have to say, but most of the
"scene" is still willfully ignorant of the deeper implications of their
participation in our scene. 

dont let them be.  dont let ignorance take over our scene.  and dont let
anyone who snuck into 420 get off the hook, either.  it's all connected... 

see you at GENERATOR (yes, a big event...but it's dougboy's, not mine, so 
dont look at me like that!! ;)

 I wasn't expecting too much from this party, I was expecting basically a 
carnival, but it turned out to be the bomb. The warrhouse was enormous, 
but dirty, everyone I know that went was blowing solid black stuff out of 
their nose all the next day.
 I didn't go in the Jungle room much. I wandered in and out of the house 
room, I liked most of what I heard - I think I must've have heard at least
10 Woody McBride records, I heard Basketball Heroes twice. Astroboy in 
the morning was incredible, other than that I don't really know who 
played when because the schedules were all messed up.
 In the main room the schedule was completely rearranged. According to 
Brendan from Ectomorph the Superstar DJs were arguing all night because 
they all wanted more time and a better time slot etc. Juan Atkins was 
incredible. Last time I'd seen him he'd played deep housy stuff, which I 
don't care much for but this time he was great. Ectomorph was good once 
they managed to get all the DJs and sound people to stop fighting and let 
them on. Following was short sets by Armani and Pullen, who here both 
good, but by this point I'd become so confused I stopped even bothering 
to try to find out who was on. Acquaviva wasn't all that. He played a lot 
of more pop-y-ish house. He was doing some really bizarre sounding tricks 
at one point though - I can't even describe it. Dubtribe I didn't care 
much for, I've liked them the times I've seen them before but unlike alot 
my friends who basically just came for Dubtribe (four of which didn't 
come until 7:30) I'm pretty sick of sharing the love, and bla bla bla 
hippy stuff.
  After-party - I wish they moved it somewhere cleaner with couches (and 
a hot-tub :) Doc Martin was pretty good, not up to what I was expecting. 
Both him and O'Keef had a lot of bad mixes too, they may have had the 
speakers set up badly or something. Michael/Allroy was dancing the whole 
time. I left about 20 minutes into Dieselboys set.

 Random disturbing note: this guy that I've sort of know for a couple 
years (meaning I've met him at parties and chatted briefly with him 
before), well a friend of mine and I were sitting on the table between 
the house room and the portapotties at about noon or so. He walks up says 
hi and pulls a gun out of his pants, loads 2 bullets in it and walks back 
out. Talk about killing the vibe?!? Besides that 420 was a great party, 
definately one of the best I've been to.

Well this was my first really large rave, and from the moment I got there 
I was in awe at the size of everything. The venue was just gigantic, I'd 
never been any place anywhere near that size. Then I thought about how 
much work must've been put into settin up all that equipment and just 
pulling everything together for something that size...wow

Was that the little leaflette about dinner and desert? I loved it, I put

	Hi all. First off, i apologize for the spam, but i think that 
there are many subscribers who may find this project quite appealing. A 
little while ago, with the helpful prodding of a few friends, i decided 
to try and put some extra space on our website to use. The project is 
called The Extraterrestrial Groove Project, and is a mixtape distribution 
system. I originally intended for it to only contain some local 
(balt/dc/va) djs, but with so many djs on the net, the scope became much 
greater. The aim of this project is to help newer, yet talented djs get 
some more exposure, while also creating a place for people to get some 
new, high quality (ie no bootlegs) tapes of new tunes by people they may 
never hear spin live, but have made tapes that are just too good not to 
hear:) 

	Ok, here is the way the project is currently going to be run. We 
are listing tapes that djs want to make available to people/promoters, 
with brief descriptions, background info, price, length, etc. We are then 
putting email links direct to the djs so they can deal with the inquiries 
themselves. It is intended to be a sort of self service system so we have 
very little involvement once we do the coding on the page. We are not 
asking any  $compensation from the djs who want to list their tapes 
this   (other than a few copies of the tapes to listen to) While the page 
is up, we are currently in the building stage (it never really ends, does 
it) and there are only a dozen or so djs listed. Any dj that is 
interested, please respond with any questions (I do get a lot of mail, 
but will try and be as quick as possible getting back to you.) We are 
also hoping to get an extremely varied selection of musical styles (it's 
all good;), so if you dj ambient,gabber, hard acid, trance(hard, 
progressive,goa...,trip-hop, house,experimental shit, whatever, get in 
touch. Like i said i don't have tons of free time, but we are pretty 
quick about doing work on our page as often as possible (there may be an 
initial backlog, but we'll get it done) Like i said this is being offered 
as a free service, and as long as we can afford to we will try and keep 
it that way. Also as i know that there are many djs who are not plugged 
in, if you know of any djs that might be interested, but no email, let 
them know about this, and get them in touch with us somehow. 

Thanks for reading

In a message dated 96-04-21 20:52:19 EDT, you write:

>I was ready to tell him to F---- off, but I stayed professional and dealt

Okay, he was maybe acting like a s.o.a.b. but he had many reasons that can
explain his behavior that night. Maybe you stayed professional, but it would
have been better if everybody would have been professional from the
beginning. At that party, the sound was a big problem for somebody who was
really playing live (no dats). Plus all the organizations' problems that
occured added to Olivers frustrations... American promotors should understand
that a real live act is not just a DJ who brings a dat. He/she needs a little
bit more attention and organization... you should see how American and
European artists are treated at other events.. especially in other
countries.... as guests. Thats all. 

I am not saying that you should not feel frustrated with the way Oliver may
have acted, but I believe he had reason to act this way. And because he
cannot read this, I feel he should have some defenese from your slanders....
and like you said he played very well.... probably because he rehearsed and
tried his best to perform in a poor sound environment (not because of you,
but because of the venue... large echo coming from the back of the stage when
the live act & DJs were in the front balcony of a large theater). 

He may have acted as a picky pain in the neck, but that was his only choice
in order to be sure that he could perform a good set, for, if he were to
stand back, it may have jeopordized his performance. 

I am sorry things didn't go as you planned, but they surely didn't go as
anyone else planned either. All we can do is learn from our past doings, and
plan for a better future... and better parties, because if all you want to
see if a person swaying their arms around to their dat, then you got it. But
if you would like to see how the music if really made.. and performed.. its
gonna take a lot more care, and it may seem like a recording studio for a bit
but thats because thats where it all started.  

Peace

i've already seen a few reviews for 420 but i figured one more wouldn't
hurt.

i really wasn't expecting that big of a party, i mean i was, but it wasn't
until i got there that I realized how huge it was going to be.  I got there
around 1 and the place was packed.  And it was a huge place , like people
said, 3 huge rooms in a warehouse complex.  the first room i checked out was
the jungle room which was probably the least crowded room.  didn't stay in
here too much just because the other rooms had a lot more people dancing.
But what i heard of Phantom 45 and Karl K/MC Dub 2 sounded really good.
Eventully I managed to find the house room after making it through the crowd
around the port-o-potties.  I think DJ Spun was spinning but I'm not sure if
they changed the schedule in there or not.  Carlos went on right at 4:20 and
his set was amazing, one of the better sets i heard from him, and he's
always great.  After that i spent most of the night in the main room, if
anyone has any clue who spinned at what time in there , let me know, because
the music was great, but no one seemed to know who was on.  I think I
managed the catch the end of the Ectomorph live PA which sounded really
good.  I saw Astroboy in the house room before dubtribe went on , he had a
good set but the crowd was starting to thin out by then.  It was cool being
able to chill outside by the house room and still hear the music perfectly.
It was my third time seeing Dubtribe live and they were great as usual,
definitely worth waiting up for.  I left around 9:30 so i missed afterhours
, and it was one hell of a long walk back to my car (i parked it on noble
rd. somewhere cuz there was no spots by the party at all when i got there).
Overall the party was a huge success, great music, sounds, lights (esp. in
the main room) and lots of happy people.  Definitely one of the best parties
I've been to, maybe the best.  I hope everyone else had a good of a time
whichever party you decided to go to.

Hey kids of all ages, shapes and sizes.  Just thought I'd add some of my 
thoughts to the 'raging debate' over "wassup wit P-town". 
	Basically, here's what I think about any rave/party/event/shindig/
whirlygig:  its only as fun as you make it.  ok. That might be a little too 
generic, there's definately stuff out of an individual 'raver's' control - ie.
music, lights,space, the openness/funness/friendlyness of people around you...
blah blah blah.  BUT, I find if you show the openness/funness/friendlyness that
you want to others, it becomes somewhat contagious.  Sure I go to Club 
Joy like lots of people - for the music, but the times I had the most 
fun, it was because of the people.  Sure there's lots of people using 
drugs (which i'm definately not down with, but i won't dis users), people 
who usually don't 'rave', but if you just do your own thang, or if your 
daring, say a friendly word to these 'non-usual' ravers, they might end 
up being pretty cool.  Even if not, you'll probably not have as weird a 
feeling yourself about the 'vibe' because your trying to help make it.
Or. Something like that. :P :)

As for the music side of pittsburgh I'm definately interested in doing 
something about that.  There's lots o' good P-burgh djs, but more out of 
townrs would be nice.  Plus, more cheap/free partys.  I think like Adam 
and the count sed - a big well designed club would be 'all-that and a 
jumbo bag of chips'.  If anyone knows of that perfect space - I'm all 
ears. @
      :)

Basically, i'm willing to help out anybody who's trying to throw 
fun/big/free/innovative or just for the hell of it partys this summer.  
:) Just say the word, and my army of faries and gnomes will come to your 
aid. :)  Sincerly. ;)

Is it just me or do you get sick of the same place, no matter how good 
the event?  I like a variety of locations.  Keeps ya young.

Hey there!  My name is Kimm and I am on the MW-RAVES mailing list.  Perhaps 
you've heard of the camping/techno festival event that happens out here in 
Wisconsin thrown by Drop Bass every year since 1994...FURTHUR.  Well, here is 
the flyer for you, incase any of you are interested in traveling.  I must say, 
it is definitely a great way to kick off the summer, and worth the drive...
If you have any questions, email me at follkj10@gbvaxa.uwgb.edu and I'll be 
glad to help you.  Hope some of you can make it!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


      It's that time of year again when our family boards the magic bus 
        and together we take a trip to an electric land, celebrating 
            the flowering of summer and our beautiful culture...

........ T H R E E   F U R T H U R   S O U N D   S T A G E S ..................

1. Main stage by MAXXIMUM SOUND of Louisville, KY.  This system features an all
   Carver powered Gauss system providing the cleanest mid/highs and the deepest
   hard hitting bass you can imagine.  The technician is the foreigh frequency
   wizard from the south known to everyone as FrenchE.

2. Live music rock stage provided by DIVERSIFIED AUDIO of Chicago, IL.  The
   sound on this stage featured Crest Audio powered EV speakers.  No need to
   hype this system, they do almost every event in the midwest!  Soundman is 
   none other than the infamous Sal.

3. Midwest focus stage supplied by Drop Bass Network's SUBKULTURE AUDIO.  This
   one features a Crest Audio powered Jr. Earthquake and JBL system... You've
   probably heard it many times at the numerous free and mid sized events in 
   the area.  It gets the job done!

Along with the three official event stages there will be numerous D.I.Y. sound
systems scattered throughout the festival site with their own djs.  Some of
those included are Network 10 (mil), Massive (mil), MJ-12 (FonDuLac), as well
as no-name rigs from Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago, Iowa, and Madison.  If
you're interested in bringing a sound system to the event you must contact Drop
Bass at 414-224-5343.  The site can only support a set number of systems and
there are guidelines that need to be adhered to.

........ L I G H T I N G   &   L A S E R S ....................................

As with past Furthur events the lighting will be minimal yet effective.  At an
oudoor event it's had to top mother nature's display of the moon and stars.  To
add to her splendor MAXXIMUM (Louisville) and the OMEN (Milwaukee) will team up
with EYEGASM (Louisville) to provide a wonderful show of lights including
miniscans and god lights with laser vipers and laser emulators.  Their
impressive work is guaranteed to please your eyes. Add to this two separate
lasers from LASERFORCE (Milwaukee) lighting up the night time sky.  Saturday's
laser is a 40 watt skyward bound Jag laser that will cover the entire festival
site.  Sunday features a 5 watt argon that will be contained in the main stage
area.  As a special surprise there will be a show in the sky Sunday night to
close out this marvelous weekend.  We want it to be a surprise but for know we
can tell you it goes bang and sparkles!

........ V I S U A L S ........................................................

Don't expect anything less than madness from a madman!  That's what you can
expect from DEMON PUPPET (formerly Brain Farm) and his display of unusual and
disturbing mind altering film loops and live video mixing.  All we can say is
that you've been warned.

........ F U R T H U R   G U I D E L I N E S ..................................

Furthur takes place in rural Wisconsin Memorial Day Weekend beginning at noon
on Friday May 24 straight through until Monday May 27 - over 72 plus hours! 
The sound stages are weather protected, making this event go rain or shine. 
Come prepared for the possibility of inclement weather.  

The location for Furthur will remain a secret until May 23.  On that date you
can call any of the main info lines or support lines in your area for
directions and information.  We can tell you that as in years past the event
will be located as equidistant as possible from Milwaukee, Chicago,
Minneapolis, Madison, and the Fox Valley.  This means your travel time from any
of these cities will be in the 1-4 hour range.  The secrecy is used in an
effort to not draw any unnecessary attention to the event site and to help add
to the excitement and anticipation of the event itself.

On site concessions including hot and cold food and beverages will be available
at reasonable prices. Drinkable water will also be made available for your
convenience.

To avoid potential problems between the people who attend Furthur and the
people in the communities around the event location, there will only be two in
and out priveleges per car over the course of the event.  We realize that some
of us look and act different than the usually conservative people in rural
Wisconsin.  To minimize any relations problems and to lesson the impact of our
event on the area this step is necessary.  Sorry for any inconveniences this
may cause.  You can help change things by showing respect for the people and
property in the local communities. Through kindness and positive attitudes we
can help in the process of change that makes everyone more open minded.  After
all, this is part of the extended vision for the reason we gather in the first
place.  Remember a few bad apples can ruin it for everyone.  It's up to each of
you to present our culture positively.

There are absolutely no guest list privileges.  If you are one of the
"important" people who expect this, come prepared to pay like everyone else.

Furthur is an alcohol and drug free event.  We do our best to bring you a
quality time without these means.  Remember this scene is about the music and
each other.  We do not want to stop anyone frmo having fun, but we do want to
make the environment safe for everyone.  Absolutely no nitrous oxide will be
tolerated.

Prepare yourself for an outdoor camping event.  We recommend the following to
keep you happy: tent, sleeping bag, pillow, backpack, extra clothes,
flashlights, food, plenty to drink, grills, firewood (this will be on sale at
the site), drums, bug spray, pets, first aid and more love to share than you
can imagine! Help the environment, bring biodegradable things.

We need your help!  If you were at either of the first two Furthurs and have
video taped footage we would like to obtain a copy of it.  Please contact
414-256-1733 with your information.  It would be greatly appreciated.

To commemorate this special weekend ESP Woody McBride and Frankie Bones will be
releasing a split 12" EP titled "FURTHUR 96" on Drop Bass Records (DBN050) and
COMMUNIQUE (C014) at the event.

........ T I C K E T   I N F O R M A T I O N ..................................
 
Tickets for the event can be purchased in advance for $20 until May 22.  They
can also be purchased at the door for $25.  This one price includes all
entertainment, attractions, parking, and camping for all four days of the
event.  Right of admission is reserved.  Advance ticked location include (sale
dates May 1 - May 22) Revolutions - 524 N. Water, Milwaukee - 414-347-1141;
7th Dimension - 3840 Atwood Ave, Madison - 608-223-0031; Cynesthesia - 611 W.

Maybe not a revolution per se but I think it is time to go back to our 
roots. Many of these new schoolers don't even know what that is. One of 
the reasons less stuff is happening is due to apathy. What once made us 
great was the willingness of every single raver to help promote a party 
both here in Pittsburgh and abroad when they went to other parties. 
unfortunately EastCoastitis snuck in sometime last year and now people 
just want to sit back and wait for the "next phat party". No one wants to 
help anymore and without promotion then a party is doomed to loose 
money.  If a promoter looses too much they stop. Is it any wonder why UDG 
is sticking to small scale efforts at the moment. It is a reflection of 
where things have gone. No one is passing out flyers in malls anymore 
hence you have a shrinking raver population rather than a larger one. You 
may laugh at that but without growth you have death and in a city the 
size of this one you have to resort to promoting at colleges, malls, high 
schools, basically anywhere young people hang out because there aren't 
that many decent under 21 nightspots. Unfortunately alot of us have 
become lax, lazy and there are people now who have NOTHING to do with 
parties who expect to be on the guest list "just cause they're so and so" 
that is EXTREME eastcoastitis! Not that I am dissing the East Coast or 
anything, yall know I love you but the attitude of alot of the ravers 
there can be summer up as jaded and lazy drug zombies, we on the 
otherhand have always taken a hands on/do it yourself approach to 
raving.  It was more of a 'burgh thing. Now we have been absorbed, argh. 
What to do?

Well like I said alot of intersting things are being planned. One 
promoter from Scotland has asked me how to go about throwing an event 
here and I will be working with him to possibly throw a big outdoor type 
thing this summer so we will have atleast one more production crew.

SCP will be throwing some more little parties this summer.
Lollipop is looking to do something again soon.
Aleph is thinking of throwing another one.
UDG is on the case and there may be a Jungle Warfare.
Sunshine kids are throwing Superfly and I expect them to be a force this 
summer.

That would be GREAT!

Very soon infact.  all we need to get is a generator.

Hi Paul, You probably remember me...  I was the person who was selling the
records.  

Well, anyways, I'm deeply involved in electronic music and would love to help
you.  

I have one official demo that was released on Love Express Records / "Milwaukee
last december.  It's a 2 song cassette with full colour inlay, etc.... etc..
I sent promos all over creation (the whole world, and hopefully some aliens)
heard it.. hhehe  And it get alot of great feedback and we moved 300 copies
with little publicity for it.

I'll send you a copy of it tomorrow.  Side 1 is West Coast Trance, Side two
is tripped out Acid Jazz.

I have alot of dats of newer material ranging from hard house to trance to
breakbeat to disco, and am currently getting remixes of some newer tracks 
done by a milwaukee local named Darwin who has appeared on labels worldwide,
and by DJ Donovan of Black Magic Records (He also release with DJ Voodo and
Crystal Method in New Orleans)

I also have a track coming out a 2 cd compilation from Milwaukee Electronic
Music Alliance.  The project is called the Fullerton Project and will be 
strictly electrnic Music from some of Milwaukee's underground electrnic talents.

It's a 2 cd set with a full color booklet, etc, and the organizer of EMA has
distribution and mailing set up for it already.  I'll forward you a promo
copy of the CD as soon as it comes out, and I'll definetly send you a promo
of the DJ Donovan remixes, etc, and my original tracks when I get some dub Plates made up for my label (sonic Domination Records).

Also if you're going to further, I've just been asked to play with a 
live trip hop band that is going to be their at the live stage on Saturday.
Most of his band can't make it, so I'm filling in.  We'll be recording a 
live dat, so we'll have more material for possible release.

that's about all for now.  

Sorry if I came off the wrong way previously when selling those records,
I was under alot of stress to come up with some money to pay off rent, and 
a keyboard, but everything is better :)

If you need any info as far as record store contacts / label contacts / 
people who manufacture cd's people who do mastering, copyright forms, 
people who make dub plates, etc..  I'll be more than willing to help.

I really believe in the unity of the "RAVE" Scene, and have had alot of 
negative experiences dealing with labels, etc..  That is one of the reasons
why I'm so willing to help, other reasons are my love for the people and the
music, and I beleive that there is strenght through unity!!!! :)

And as a sign of friendship, I did save a Kraftwerk record, and I'll send
that to you along with the promo tape.  :)

plur!!!!

just thought I'd make a comment or two about the party..

Didn't know who was spinning most of the time but I know I caught John 
Acquaviva who was pretty cool, Robert Armani was pretty cool too, and I 
also caught most of Carlos' set, which was awesome!

When we first got there we put our bags down by one of the trash bins on 
the right side of the stage area, and a little later some other people 
were around there with a tank of nitrous and were handing out baloons, 
which was pretty cool an all, but when we came back later there were *so* 
many people crowded around there huffing baloons and smoking weed that it 
took us like 5 minutes to get to our bags..that kinda sucked so we went 
and slept for like an hour :)

Finally met stevie t  and also some other cool kids from royalton

uhh what else...this was the first really big party i've been to and I 
was pretty impressed..i hope there'll be more party's like this in 
cleveland sometime in the future :)

Chris

Hi all!


	Does anyone know how many people attended these events and if they
were shut down early (e.g. the police)... If the party was large, can you 
estimate to the nearest 100?  Thanks everyone...you don't know how much 
you are helping us out...if anyone has any questions regarding ravedata 
projects two out of the three "rave info compiler's" will be at Eclipse 
in DC on Saturday...if you are unable to make it and have a question send 
it to the address below. Thanks!  
All resposes can be mailed to "ravedata@partnercomm.com"
Love-
Nicole

=================================================================
Sunshine kids are throwing Superfly and I expect them to be a force this 
summer.
=================================================================

i like how the pitt scene and the ohio scene have become completely
oblivious to each other since my friend walt just threw a party
named SUPER FLY two months ago in columbus - purdy decent party too
w/ mike huckaby & greg sargent & 800 kids. but then again pitt had
PLUSH before the Just Us Kids decided to throw PLUSH the party about
two weeks ago in dayton. oh welly.

=================================================================
Hey I heard that Steve lost $20 G because something happened to the cash? 
Is there any truth to this rumor and or does anyone have any other info
about this?

What whould this mean for AVA?
=================================================================

i think it wuz more on the lines of $15 G and it wuz mostly due
to one bad cop that wuz lettin in kids in the back - near the 
second room. basically the cop pocketed all the money & took off.

AVA? what r u talking about? the only ava i know is ava aka 
elektrika star from baltimore. and she's alive & well. if u meant
deep records - which would've been a more feasible question since
it is deep records & steve cinch that will suffer the most from
this. i believe deep may be outta comissh for awhile 'til steve
makes up the $ from playing out & making new music.

but the person who can best answer all these questions is steve
himself, hey kevin, wanna get steve to type a few words on to
the list about all this?

Frankie Bones spun in the main room. Does anybody have a clue on what the 
third song was. I just listen to the video tape of the event (stereo sound and 
Video of the main room) and I am really diyng to get this record. It was 
around 150 bpm, very trancy (transe-core). If you know e-mail me privately.

Sorry to waiste the bandwith.

PS : I will NOT make copies of the video tapes, so don't bother to ask.

Regarding not sending a dat tape, is it beacuse somebody could easily steal
your music then?

If they wanted to steal it, no matter if you sent a cd, record, or high quality
tape they could re-record it digitally, remaster it, and press it.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

following IGNITION around midnight, GENERATOR moves to the batelle hall

also, once inside, look for a booth by the 21/22 CORPORATION, which is an
integral part of the ele mental mission.  here you will find information
about us and music by columbus techno musicians on the FUSION compilations
(including two new ones: 5 & 6), as well as charles noel/monochrome's last

ok, first, here's the directions to POTENT PERCUSSION vol 1, tonight, 
friday night.

anyone who knows columbus already, it's at jen and elaine's house at 38 
west oakland, just a couple blocks north of lane avenue.

if you are coming from the south, take 71 N to columbus to the HUDSON ST
exit (112 i think) and take LEFT there.  go 1 mile west to HIGH st, take a 
LEFT there also.  go down about 1/2 mile and look for OAKLAND on the 
right, take a RIGHT and look for #38 west oakland.

from the north, follow as above but take a RIGHT on hudson instead of a LEFT.

from east and west, take 70 into columbus, to 71 N, then follow 
directions from the south.  

it's easy, it's fun, and most of all:  it's gonna be free!
(optional $1 donation to pay gas money for the djs)

doug holmes'll be there selling tickets for GENERATOR, too...it'll be your
*LAST CHANCE* to get $15 pre-sale tickets unless you are coming from 
reeeally far away and you leave a reeeeally nice message for us at 614 470 
0929 or doug's # 614 297 7532.  we reserve the right to refuse, but if 
you're like coming all the way from wisconsin or something, the least we 
can do is give you $5 off for supporting us...so do call.  (but dont get mad 
if we cant get back to you, tho...just ask at the door on sat).

**

arrighty, directions for IGNITION, the saturday pre-party for GENERATOR, 
are as follows:

it's at the grant/gay apartment building, many of you already know where 
this is.  if you dont, read on.

from the south: take 71 N to downtown columbus, to the broad st exit. 
take a LEFT there, go down about 7 lights to GRANT ST.  take a RIGHT on
grant, then one block north look for the only building on the southeast
corner of GRANT and GAY st.  it'll be in the basement. 

from the north, follow as above but take a RIGHT instead of a left on 
broad st.

from the east and west, take 70 into columbus then go 71 north to the 
broad st exit, and follow as from the south.

this event will also be free!!!!!  it features ATMAN, ROB RAGE, DAVE 
COOPER (toronto), and UFO (san fran)...so come check it out...from 8 pm 
to 12 midnight.

**

GENERATOR itself will begin shortly after 12 midnight at the batelle hall 
of the columbus convention center, on the north end of downtown columbus.

tickets will be $20 at the door unless you are on the $15 presale ticket 
list at the door.

call 614 470 0929 for more detailed directions to the main space, but it 
is only about 4 blocks west and 2 blocks north of grant and gay (in case 
that helps!).
 
everything IS confirmed, secured, and so on.

please respect our city, the convention center, and the surrounding area by 
being responsible with your drug use and all that...we dont want any 
irresponsible people at this event which we (mostly doug) have worked on 
for over 6 months.  think before you do anything you are not sure about.

there is a strong possibility that there will be a free afterhours as 
well, so stay tuned.

if anything else comes up i'll post it, tres bien?

ya ... is there anything to do on saturday? I know Supa C was playing friday
at club joy, but that was strictly for tha 21+ crowd. Also, I just gotten
back from tha Strip Bar, and the new owners destroyed it. They took out
the tables (turn tables that is), removed the graffitti (chalk) from the
walls, no more rave flyers on the way in ... and above all they turned up
the lights :( ... on the brighter side, they played Digable Planets and Tribe
Called Quest cd's while we where there ...

Sowwy this is so late.  Been partying like it's 1999.

ES is original music by a guy named Ken who is very nice, 
with an animated stage 
presence when he talks.  He has many metal boxes with wires emanating from 
them and speakers with sound that sallies forth.  The small event on 
Thursday was a hella chilled out situation in a little coffee place on 
the CMU campus.

The good news is the music was quite nice.  The bad news is it was 
poorly (read dismally) attended.  Yes, there are finals and things, but 
not EVERY yinzer on this list is mired in academic gook, and fer pete's 
sake, it was fucking free.  Like, no money.  And this after so much talk 
about how there's nothing to do and no support...

End of tangent.  ES floated from ambient to trance, tossing in some hip 
hop beats here and there for flava, then ambled over to 
quicker techno and some jungle.  Although I was dubious about some of the 
sounds he chose at first, it tended to work in the end.  

Two songs impressed me particularly.  One was an ambient thing with mad, 
mad, endless loop reverb.  The thin sound foundation was just fine, but what 
was impressive is that, since every sound he made got echoed for the rest 
of the piece, he had to get them all just right, and he did.  He fiddled 
with the 
sampler, processor, computer, etc, but really built the song with little 
peices of guitar melody (a pretty sunburst Squire), soft singing (slightly 
evocative of Peter Gabriel on that Last temptation thing or Milton 
Nascimento on Angelus if that means anything) and vocalizations (he made a 
sound like ...ssssSSSSPAH) that kept layering and blending into a 
primordial soup till the end of the song.  He nailed it.

The other one that got me was a jungle song (of course!).  In the 
beginning it had this pop production drum sound and I wasn't sure....But 
more sounds came in and blended with it, making it sound good, and 
actually kinda sarcastic.  Clever. ;)

Also, a lot of his set was chilled out, but one song almost made me get 
out on the floor all by myself.  Congas, piano/organ, right on rhythm, 
and just the right build.  

I think it's great he's exploring different styles, and he does them 
well.  My only criticism is that he doesn't come from a percussive angle, 
which is fine for ambient, and not necessarily a problem in trance and 
techno (4/4 and a coupla tricks is really all it takes), but 
jungle's biggest strength is its rhythmic freedom and 
versitility.  The more creative you can get with rhythms and polyrhythms, 
the better.  Here, there's room for perfection.  Or maybe I'm a sucker for 
cheap tricks.

All in all, quite a quality performance, well worth the walk.  Plus I got to 
play air hockey for free later on.  :)  Keep on eye on this guy.

well no one's done a review of the party yet but i wanted to say a couple 
things about it anyway.

first of all i want to say that doug (doughboy) deserves ALL the credit
for this event.  it wasnt my party, although it was an ele mental
party...which in this case means we all helped and did what we could to
back up doug, who masterminded the event from day one. 

i want to thank all of you who came (especially those who came from
faraway places!)...thanks to you, doug almost broke even (altho i sure do 
wish the boy had made _something_ after doing all that work).

the numbers: about 1000 people paid (we needed 1200 to break even).  $20 
seemed a bit steep for an "ele mental" gig, but i know what doug went 
through and he kept the price as low as he could.  anyone who felt it 
wasnt worth the money, come to =trans= this saturday which will only cost 
_$3_ and feature dan curtin from cleveland and shake from detroit, so 
dont say we've sold out ;)

im not going to bother to review the event except to mention my own
personal highlights...starting with the friday preparty, POTENT PERCUSSION
vol 1, which rocked!  unfortunately the ceiling was a little too low to
dance but the music was great all night.  sparkle had a wonderful hard-ass
jungle debut, mouse (who drove all the way from milwaukee!!!) kept the
crowd moving with soulful jungle, blender's slo-breaks rocked (altho she
got frustrated a couple times...it's ok b!  you got me to dance to
dubtribe which is QUITE a feat), kevy kev has officially become cool in my
book (im teasing you kevin), and divine was sweet (book this man!). 
powerhouse spun to an empty room (sorry kevin) but so it goes... 
the best thing about it was the way 3 grrrls dominated the evening early 
on...as sparkle mentioned to me, it was cool to feel that female energy 
representing, yo wassup.

so for me the preparty was the highlight of the weekend.  no stress about 
money, no stress about getting busted, nothin.  and i got to chill with 
the cru, what could be better?

as far as GENERATOR goes, i dont want to say much about the djs because
i'm sure someone else'll do it. 

but i'm glad the message got out about the 21/22 corporation, which is
monochrome's little company which releases compilation tapes and vinyl... 
we set up a table to sell some of that stuff, and to debut FUSIONs 5 & 6,
so hopefully people will dig em.  now that i think about it, i dont know of
anyone else trying to do what charles is doing...which is putting out
techno by people like us.  and he hasnt made a dime on it yet, he does it
for the music.  mad props. 

i think titonton outdid himself!  his set seemed designed to keep me
happy, which (as i stood at the door) it sure did.  the peak was when he
came out from behind the tables to spin from the FRONT of the tables...
what a sight!  and he was pulling all kinds of claude young-isms like 
licking the records, stopping them with his elbow, etc...and he even 
pulled out "stepping out" by joe jackson which is the same speed as 
jungle...heee hee

as i drove from the space to the afterhours, i went past the new part of 
the columbus convention center which is all funky-looking and colorful 
architecture (crazy-ass postmodern shit), and i noticed a couple ravers 
just chilling on the sidewalk in the bright morning.  they looked so at 
home, and i finally understand that building, it's perfect for what 
happened inside.

the afterhours at idiot boy was cool, the explicit guys helped a lot with 
their sound and lighting stuff so i gotta give them props too.  i finally 
got to chill there and talk to people, especially jeff/stuff and 
kate/keight (oh yah and that MINT character ;)...which i really needed 
after a stressful evening of door-watching, running around, and so on.
but then the nitrous showed up and i said "see ya."  i cant stand the 
sight of people making money off that bullshit while my boy doug's not 
going to be able to make rent this month...

anyway, i'm not here to sob on behalf of doug...he himself was happy that 
so many people seemed to have a tremendous time.  i heard so many people 
tell me how much they loved it (altho i myself couldnt really judge 
because i really wasnt there, so to speak) that it made me proud to be 
part of this whatever-it's-called named ele mental.  

that's what we do, i guess...i just hope people are listening.  if you 
really want to know what we're all about come to one of our small events, 
you'll feel it!  i dont know why people only want to come to the big 
stuff...it's strange.  i'd rather go to a small party with a phat lineup 
of people i know i'll love...oh well, call me silly i guess.

sorry, this turned into another one of my usual monumental posts, so i'll
shut up now. 

look for a _real_ monumental post sometime soon, as this weekend got me 
thinking about a lot of stuff (and yes that's a threat ;)...

Well, Cloud9 was shut down a couple weeks ago.  The door is locked tight 
and it seems there's little hope for it to re-open in the same fashion as 
it existed before.  I think the reason for closing was financial, they 
had a silent partner back out or something and thus were having trouble 
making payments on bills.  I also heard a rumor, but it was that the 
owners of Metropol/Rosebud may be buying it after the Sheriff's auction.  
Didn't hear anything about ...

> drugs?

but that sounds like a rumor to me.  Let's hope something happens to 
bring the space back to life 'cause I really liked that place (although 
the DJ culture went a little stagnant in the past few months).  We need 
variety!

later,

Regarding the techno/camping festival "Even Furthur" going on May 24-27 in
Wisconsin...

The following are a bunch of questions that were either posted to mw-raves or
sent to me.  I realize many other people may have the same questions so I am
posting the list of questions and their answers to everyone that got the flyer
for Even Furthur...

1)  Are there any bus trips planned from any areas?
     - No, not to Drop Bass's knowledge.

2)  Are there time constraints as to when you can come and go?
     - No, you may come at any time after Friday at noon until it ends.  You
       may also leave at any time but there is a limit of 2 times that each 
       car can leave.  Staff will be working the door 24/7.

3)  Will the ticket price be cheaper on Saturday than on Friday?
     - No.  No matter what day you come, the ticket price at the door 
       remains $25.00.

4)  Can I get pre-sale tickets by mail order?
     - Yes.  Send your $20.00 to :  DROP BASS NETWORK  
                                    1654 North Jackson, Lower
                                    Milwaukee, WI  53202
       Check or Money Order payable to Drop Bass Network.
       HOWEVER the money must get there before MAY 18th or the full ticket
       price will be in effect.

5)  Can I sleep in my car/van/ryder/uhaul?  
     - Yes you may, however you won't be able to camp in the main area then...
       The main area will consist of the main sound tents, and people camping
       with tents.  There will be other areas where cars will be parked, and
       a last area will consist of people that are camping in cars.  This 
       area also has electricity.

6)  How far of a drive will it be from Cleveland/New York/Egypt/Brazil/etc?
     - Figure out how far your city is from Chicago... Even Furthur will be
       less than 3.5 hours from Chicago.  It is less than 2.5 from Milwaukee,
       and an hour from Madison.

7)  Which airport should I fly into?
     - Ideally, Madison's airport is the closest.  But it probably would be 
       cheaper to fly to Mitchell Int. in Milwaukee or Ohare in Chicago...

8)  Are there showers?
     -  Yes!! There are showers, running water, and toilets!!!!!

I hope this answers some of the questions you may have...  If anyone else has
any questions not covered here you may send them to me at 
FOLLKJ10@gbvaxa.uwgb.edu    or Craig at archon@execpc.com   

Kimm Follett

woo woo!  is anyone coming to columbus for this?

tony ramos' party is going to be the bomb.  small but phat as hell.

i think tony already posted the info to the mw list, but it's called
=trans= with dan curtin from cleveland, shake from detroit, titonton, 
monochrome, and placebo.  and it'll be in a cool space that does v/r stuff.  

most of all, it's cheap as hell!!  so anyone who has complained about all
these expensive parties lately, well let's see you support an event that's
light on the wallet but heavy on the vibe.  

anyone remember azure?  i expect the same kind of feeling...*wink wink*

Hey everybody-
	(sorry for the cross posting BUT this is the bes and only way to 
get the question out to all the lists that I know of!!)
	Everyone has been doing a super job helping us and we appreciate 
it so much!!! And as we get responses to our questions, our numbers go 
down by the hundreds BUT as you all know new parties are always happening 
so our number goes up very quickly again...SOOO..I know that a lot of 
people are cramming for finals (Good luck!) but this should be the last 
question for awhile (at least from me since my budget is technologically 
behind the times and I don't have net access...but Matt does) so please 
if you know where are any of these dj's are from (city and state) we'd 
really appreciate...the dj number is up to the 1400's now, so anybody 
that doesn't see dj names that were on here before don'y worry that means 
we just have the city now thanks to you guys!!!
	Again Thank you so much and good luck to those of you with finals!!!
Love -
Nicole

After a losing battle with the road system in DC my friends and I 
(Slange, Tundji, Ed & Myself) found ourselves at the MASSIVE DC Armory.
We hung out in the parking lot and enjoyed the beautiful day for a few 
minutes and we went in. After a very quick check of my bag and a pat down 
I felt like I had entered another dimension...  'The Eclipse Dimension'
all I could say for about five minutes was WHOA! I had no other way to 
express what I saw except for utter perfection. The lights were TOP notch 
about 18-20 intellabeams mainly Goldscans plus 'Rabbit in the Moon' had a 
couple along with their stage setup. 4 incredible lasers providing a 
pseudo ceiling along with excellent visuals, what more could you expect 
from Centrax. The four projection screens were intense, props to the folks 
who made those projections possible. The sound system was just right... 
crisp, clean, highs and real hard hittin' lows..  you can't expect any 
less from a soundsystem that's comprised of ALL Turbosound. With the 
combo of all these extras, plus the onslaught of nonstop quality music throughout 
the evening/day this party has won the top spot on my list of raves. I'm 
not going to ramble on about the DJs I'll just tell ya' who I thought 
were good... umm that would have to be all of them. Adam X's all 
killer/no filler tweaked acid sound always gets me movin'. Prototype 909 
this is the 2nd time I've heard them in two weeks and I think they are 
excellent... real minimal, real hard edged.  Hipp-E, some good funky acid 
and breaks stuff that was nothing but groovy. All Mighty Senators.... 
uhh, yeah... Kemistry & Storm: "OH MY GOSH!!!" mind blowing jungle that 
made my legs turn to bloody stumps... couldn't stop if I tried, the crowd 
didn't get into it as much as I hoped, not enough of a lighter/whistle 
crew, and MC Ribbs refused the crowd a rewind a few times... what a let 
down. Dubtribe... nice breaky acidy housey stuff that was so thick with 
groove you could cut the shit with a knife. Dj Sun, the man impressed me 
big time at Pittsburgh's Tunnel Vision, and he kept me going. Rabbit in 
the Moon, I was slightly under the weather at this point... ummm not sick 
however just under the weather, the music was real fucked up at least 
that was the way I heard it, to others it was beautiful... to me well 
from the condition I was in at that point all music was real evil 
sounding and it wasn't just the music... cause Rabbit in the Moon puts 
out some excellent trax and I'm listining to one right now 'Out of Body 
Experience" Their stage show was great... a live act isn't usually much to 
look at because they're usually a bunch of dudes hunching over sequencers and 
synths creating music. From the vantage point that the crowd had, you 
really couldn't see what they were doing. (unless however you are the 
Stickman and 6'6") :). To end it all Scott Henry went on and the crowd, 
the vibe, the lights, the lasers, EVERTHING was going completely insane. 
The party built and built til it went into a freakin' Supernova of chaos.   
The party wrapped up and I felt like crying... Lonnie was smiling like a 
kid in a candy store and everyone had the best looking smiles on. It was 
the perfect ending to a perfect nite. 

Props go to everyone except the Swindlin' paper crew... 

MAD PROPS TO LONNIE & SETH and the whole Ultraworld Crew for making 
Eclipse what it was. Even though there was a considerable loss, Lonnie 
will and has profited big time due to what he sacrificed... 
The generosity always comes back to ya... and this return is gonna be a big 
one!!! Thank you... for everything. 

				Stickman

PS. If anyone found a Green and yellow flourescent bong with a 611 sticker 
I lost it and I don't remember where.

saturday i drove down to columbus with a bunch of cleveland friends to
generator.  im glad i went - the party was great!  we didn't make it to the
pre party, but we did get to stand in line at the convention center for the
party to open (i hate lines, actually i never really stood in it, but there
was a really long line of kids waiting to get in - fortunately i had friends
up at the front) and i have to add that i loved the tickets :) they had this
silver stuff on the back that rubbed off, it was a $20-sparkle-spreader!  

welp, the location was very nice, it made me feel like it was such a
dignified event.  im more acustom to the dirt and grime places.  i really
liked being able to step out of the party after about 8 hours of dancing and
running around and just step on an elevator to go directly to my car. :)  

the lights and the music were perfect. i didn't hear anything i didn't love.
 i danced endlessly.  as usual i neglected to pay any attention at the time
to the details of the lineup, i should really make more of an effort to
acknowledge djs who really impress me.   But the problem is, when i really
like a dj, ill lose myself in their music and it never really occurs to me to
find out who it is...really im usually having a ball dancing and time slips
by me.  In fact, at generator, time passed SO quickly (mark of a GOOD party
:) ) before i knew it, the sun was out, it was after 6am and my legs hurt :)

i went to the afterhours for a little while, that was nice.  Ive never been
to idiot boy, although ive been prodded to go everytime i treck down to
columbus.  I like it!   But i was tired and still had to drive home, so....we
all left.  Unfortunately sunday was not my luckiest of days.  Some gosh darn
officer of the highway patrol clocked me going 88 on 71N, told me i had made
an illegal lane change (didn't happen - luckily he didnt ticket me for that),
i didn't have my license on me (whoops), and to top it off, my plates were
expired(i wasn't aware).  Evidently that means the car is legally
"un-drivable" and this cop tells me i should call a tow truck to get it
towed.  Well, i had already been whimpering away, we were over an hour away
from cleveland.  I said: 
"but sir?!  cant you just write me some sort of legal notification simply to
allow me to drive my car back home?" 
he said: "no."
"but sir?! how am i supposed to get home?"
"the tow will take you"
"and my four other friends?!"
"yes"
"to CLEVELAND?!"
"yes"
then all of a sudden we hear more sirens... a fire truck pulls up in front of
my car and a dozen fully prepped fire men climb out.  Turns out this highway
official needed to study his codes better - because according to the code he
called in over his intercom thingy, this was not a moving violation, it was a
fire! :)  Needless to say, it was all a messed up situation.  The firemen
left, i called my father, the nice cop dumped me and my friends at the local
McDs and forced me to abandon my poor vehicle on the side of the highway.  i
dont think i like cops.  funny thing is, i have a top-of-the-line radar/laser
detector, the thing isn't worth half a crap.

but yeah - Generator was  a great party!  Even after i was pulled over, i was
still in a good mood!

lots of luv
leah
