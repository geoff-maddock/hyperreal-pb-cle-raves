(Breaks: oops.  that last message i sent was a mistake.  I hit the wrong
key while looking at a postponed message i had meant to delete.  Horribly
outdated.  sorry for the confusion and the silly story.)

I heard J Smooth from Philly at a small party in Norristown the other day
and got to really listen to him for the first time.  He definitely brought
the vibe.  :)  It wasnt' meant to be a jungle room, but ended up perfect
for it.  A perfect size for the crowd, half dancing, half chillin on the
couches and floor, everyone having a good time.  His set was energetic and
tight, a nice break from the darkness hovering around lately.  I'm not one
for trainspotting, but I can tell you the character of his set was, hmmm,
wavelike I guess.  Not just hard-hitting all the time.  he seems to
understand the value of ebbs and flows.  He built up and brought down
within a certain range so that the highs accented the lows and vice versa.
Perfect for dancing.  People loved it.  Look for his name--you'll have a
good time. :)

Second, my goodness, Adair (pittsburgh) makes me happy.  :)  Ok ok, maybe
I'm biased b/c she's a friend of mine.  Or maybe not....I heard her spin
before I ever met her.  She has this mischeivous, nymphish way about her.
This tiny forest flower of a female approaches the tables with a doaist
grin and a sparkle in her eye.  One expects, ok, a nice chill intelligent
set. I can deal with that.

But then she drops the needle and a tidal wave of darkness rushes out.  ;)
And lately she's gotten into grooves as well as darkness.  Her style isn't
sneaky.  It's kind of on display, kind of tactile, but not gawdy.  Her
mixer tricks are clever, cutting over to a perfectly placed sample that
might make you laugh, smoothing from 1/4 of the way over on the crossfader
to 3/4 of the way over for a swirly effect.  Basically, not perfect
%100 of the time, but very solid most of the time and lots of fun. I
think she's only been spinning out for like 9 or ten months and even since
summer when I first heard her, she's gone in leaps in bounds.  In another
year or so, watch out.

Always respecting the up-and-coming talents trying to make their way in
the scene,
stephanie

yippee, my messages are getting thru now!

i was just playing taipei on the computer (it's like mahjongg)--highly
addictive--and when you win, you get a fortune that is usually like
one from a fortune cookie, but the one is got this time was:

"bouncy ball is the source of all goodness and light"

this is true, very funny. maybe one of those things that makes sense
in chinese but not english. scott, maybe you can ask amber if she
knows if that makes sense in chinese. (she's our friend who went to
china & is there right now)

anyway, on with the review of aeonia. warning for the overly anal-
retentive: this is a long review! so delete it now if you don't
want to read it (well duh).

my friend chris, who's on pb-cle-raves, came here from youngstown,
ohio at about 1 pm, then we went to akron, got lost, got unlost, +
picked up my friend shelly. then we went to greenfield, indiana &
got the other chris, who's on mw-raves. we finally got to st. louis at
about 10:30 pm CST. it's a good thing that's another time zone.       
								      
this place was kind of hard to find. we walked around outside for like
10 min trying to find the bldg & entrance. the people at the door were
searching everybody. i didn't have anything illegal but when they 
searched me, they threw away (ohio) chris's effidrin (is that spelled
right?) which was in my backpack. but he says it's legal so i don't
know why they would throw it away. they tried to throw away my water
bottle but somehow i talked them into letting me keep it. i think
they were confiscating candy too because there was a lot of it lying
on the floor next to them but they didn't see the blowpops in my
backpack. after this absurd searching-fiasco, we found out the price
was $25. ouch. i thought i had seen a flyer once that said it was $9,
or is that my imagination?

we finally got inside, it was pretty cold in there. the space was
fairly nice, really big. the infoline said it's an armory, but it's
apparently been converted into something else. i didn't like how there
was carpet all over the 1st room floor. it's nice to sit on in the
back, but no fun to dance on. i fell once! (oops!...so embarassing!)
:] my feet always catch on it & it messes up my dancing. the 2nd room
was a "batting cage room" + it was very small. but most of the time
there weren't that many people in there anyway. tile floor & seating
by the wall. :] the 3rd room was upstairs & it had a bar. i saw
equipment set up but nobody was playing or making music when i was in 
it. we were told it was 21 + up there but nobody checked my ID. (ohio)
chris has a wheelchair & couldn't walk up the steps, although we 
managed to get him up the stairs outside. much thanks to the people 
that helped us if you're on here. but, if you didn't see the 3rd room,
you didn't miss anything as far as i know except the bar & most of you
don't like alcohol anyway right? ;>

in rooms 1 + 2 the sound was SO loud! (indiana) chris told me t3 was 
even louder. until now i had never needed earplugs at a party. i 
should bring some next time just in case. i think if they would have 
turned down the treble levels some the sound would have probably been 
ok.

i can't say too much about the lighting or most of the DJs because i 
wasn't feeling well + my eyes were hurting a lot & sensitive to bright
lights (prob. since they got scratched. driving at nite sucked!), so i
was sitting down a lot resting & trying to avoid strobes & lasers. but
they got better periodically. right now i can only use this computer 
since i've got the screen brightness way low. i had to go to the eye 
dr. yesterday for this & she had to put drops in my eyes to dilate my 
pupils, so she was explaining what it means when your pupils are 
dilated & i had to try hard not to laugh because of course i already 
know what that means!

but i can say something about 1 DJ, DRC (who i wanted to see most, for
the 1st time), she kicked everybody's ass! =] that was the only time i
could find enough energy to seriously dance. her set seemed a lot
different from her mixtapes (well i have 4 of them), which have lots 
of samples & more tricks, but it was still very good. i took her 
picture a couple times too. (woo woo!) (heather, e-mail me & we can 
trade those pictures when they are developed). blender, what you said 
about DRC is very true! ;D when she was done, she was sitting on the 
side of the stage + i told her i liked her set & she shook my hand & 
said thanks. (((promoters: book DRC...book DRC...book DRC...she is 
god))) <--subliminal message, haha!

a little bit later i went upstairs & fell asleep then went downstairs
to the bathroom (it was really icky =[ by then) but forgot my
backpack. when i went back up, somebody guarding the stairs said the
door was locked & the room was closed but go to the other stairs. so i
did + i told the woman guarding THOSE stairs that my backpack was up 
there & i HAD to get it back & nobody had told me before i left that i
couldn't go back in. she wasn't going to let me up & said: are any of 
your friends up there? i thought: this is retarded, + was freaking out
& said: no. she said: ok hurry up + go get it. so i ran up there & got
it. but the room didn't lok closed to me, there were still just as
many people up there just sitting around. i'm pissed off at whoever
was in charge of closing that room.

by that time we were all tired & freezing & ready to leave but we 
hadn't found paul (also on mw-raves) yet whose place we were 
supposed to stay at. i hadn't even met him before but miraculously 
i somehow found him. then soon we left. none of us went to the 
afterhrs party, did anybody go? how was it? was there really 
"champagne & brunch" or whatever? was the champagne any good? 
i want to know what i missed & if it was worth missing free champagne 
so i could sleep. that quazar flyer for it was funny, it brings back 
fond memories of quisp! *tear, sigh* :] see the kid with 4 eyes on the
flyer? haha. what is "space trivia #1"? i couldn't find it on the
back. so we went to paul's, you live in a really cool place paul! (it
looks like it used to be a factory; it has those modular 
factory-bathrooms) who is your friend the girl who was with you? we 
weren't introduced + i forgot to ask.

after we woke up we left + went to waffle house! i'd never been to 1 
before. the food was very good, yum yum! but me & (indiana) chris 
found some weird looking stuff on the menu. like you could get some 
pretty strange stuff on your hashbrowns. it said 
"get them SCATTERED and: 
SMOTHERED with ONIONS
MELTED with CHEESE
TOPPED with CHILI
CHUNKED with HAM
DICED with TOMATOES
or get them SCATTERED, SMOTHERED, MELTED. TOPPED, CHUNKED, and DICED"

ok, onions & cheese on hashbrowns sounds good, but ham is 
questionable, tomatoes is kind of weird, & chili is just plain gross 
(and that combination is exponentially bad!). don't get the chili if 
you want to leave waffle house alive! just kidding. i have no idea 
what the chili is actually like, it just sounds pretty sick. speaking 
of chili, definitely don't eat it at wendy's (but do eat their other 
food; much better than mcdonald's, etc.), i used to work at 1 + i know
where the meat in it has been. write me back if you really want to 
know.

then we left waffle house at like 4 pm, then drove & drove + dropped 
off chris in greenfield, indiana; shelly in akron, ohio; & i finally 
got home at 3 thurs morning. =d

Hi everyone.

Since I'm moving out of the Pittsburgh area forever soon, and since I
don't have time to deal with pb-cle-raves anyway, I'd like to offer the
duties of running the list and the website to someone else.  You would be
able to do most everything remotely, but if you have a good idea what's up
with UNIX, majordomo, and bullshit, there might be a hyperreal account in
it for you.  if you're interested, please contact me privately.

thanks,


Tom Butcher : ( hyperreal )

Definitely!  She really has fun when shes mixing! I'd say thats one thing
that A LOT of big name djs forget to do.  Have fun!  Damn, smoothness isn't
ALL THAT when you look bored out of your mind.  I mean, come on, jungle was
made to fuck up, RIGHT!? YEAH! The whole point to being a DJ is not to just
play some records, the whole point is to make a vital, cohesive, interesting
and NEW sounding artistic expression from a variety of recorded sources,
while using all the resources and skills at hand.  In other words, FUCK THEM
RECORDS UP!!! If there is one thing Adair knows how to do, its have fun, and
mix up the jungle "choons"  (thats what they call them these days right?)
Anyway, my (and obviously Stephanie's) point is, if you have the chance DO
NOT MISS ADAIR! You'll be sorry, and when she's queen size someday, you'll
look back and say, DAMN I coulda seen her for $5 back inna day! DUH!

Josh, chill out kiddo.  I'm no fuzzy plurball, but I really think you're
taking this a bit too seriously.  We're talking about subtle stylistic
differences.  Frank happens to like Adair's style and finds it to stand
out a bit. Some people like to watch Carlos because he's different, some
people don't.  Big deal. And anyway, it sure seems like some, NOT ALL, djs
aren't having fun when they mope around after sets.  Some, NOT ALL, djs do
this, no?  Many complain that they're not having fun.  I think that that's
a good indication that, um, they're not having fun.  :P

You almost seem to be taking this personally.  The point was to give a
thumbs up to someone we'd give a thumbs up to in person  (and a few "big
name" djs have done the same, Mr. Blah blah blah adair blah blah ;).  It
was certainly not an attempt to diss everyone who is different from what
was described.  Nor is a compliment to one person equilvalent to a dig on
everyone else. Way to define things negatively, i.e. logically backwards.

Maybe fuck shit up?  Maybe fuck with the status quo?  maybe fuck with
everything you thought you knew about breakbeats?  Fuck, let's throw
caution and definitions to the wind and make a phat track!  Some jungle
says this to me.  Anyway, it says a lot, and it makes me happy, and so
do Adair and J Smooth.  

I have no qualms about expressing this opinion and
I vibe best with people who share this kind of attitude.  One of the
things I love best about being into this stuff (esp compared to other
music I've been into) is the joy of meeting someone else who shares this
pure enthusiasm.  It's possible to be analytical and intelligent about
your music but still go nuttah over it. I hope I never get too hardnosed
to appreciate the _joy_ in jungle, and music in general.  It's good to be
happy, no? Too plurry for you Josh?  Can I offer you a midol?  ;) JUST
KIDDING!!!!

This seems like a dumb discussion to me, rather an excersize in beating
the self-evident to death and I have a feeling I'm going to regret
getting into it.  So here's where I duck out.

Not to beat a dead hobo, but I think that "jungle was made to fuck up"
was meant to mean - it is meant to be fucked with, cut-up, etc....to fuck
shit up!  In other words, don't just fade one track into another over
and over.  If that makes any sence. :P  I don't think it was made for this
more than any other dance music...but anyway.

I really hate trainwrecks too, but I don't mind if a dj makes little
screw-ups when trying to pull of cool tricks - to me energy is more
important than perfect mixing...if you can do both...then your my hero!

As a third paragraph...I'd like to mention that I'll be doing a show on
WPTS 92.1 FM (U. of pitt radio) at a time when people might actually be
able to listen -> Mondays 11-1 am.  I play a mix of jungle 
(hardstep/jumpup/tech), happy hardcore, and gabber, with some ambient &
industrial to fill in the blank spots.  It should be on next week.
There's a possibility of WPTS having a mixshow open to local djs...but
we're still considering and seeing what timeslots are free.

till nexttime,
 have phun,

I TOTALLY AGREE!

I wasn't saying anything about the way a dj looks when he/she is mixing.  My
point was that in my opinion it seems that some big name djs don't seem at
all concerned with experimenting with their records.  A lot of djs simply
play tracks one after another, with no interesting mixing.  Mind you, not
all music is appropriate to play with (fuck up) which brings me to my second
point:

>

Well of course! 
I didn't mean fuck up = poorly mix. DUH! I mean, who the fuck wants to hear
trainwrecks!? I meant fuck up = mix up, cut back and forth, make the tracks
sound different than they do normally.  In my opinion, jungle is the perfect
kind of music to play around with in the mix.  Of course those beats better
be DAMN TIGHT before you start playing around with them! 

Anyway, I guess not all big name djs aren't having fun, thats up to them.
All I was saying is that it seems to me that a lot of djs aren't intersted
in taking RISKS with their music.  I think taking risks is one of the most
important things a DJ can do.  If one doesn't take chances, things stagnate.
Disagree with that?  I think we agree.  I know I agree with everything you
said!  :) peace -Frank

good?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I TOTALLY AGREE!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I wasn't saying =
anything about the way a dj looks when he/she is mixing. =
&nbsp;My<br>&gt; point was that in my opinion it seems that some big =

their records. &nbsp;A lot of djs simply<br>&gt; play tracks one after =
another, with no interesting mixing. &nbsp;Mind you, not<br>&gt; all =
music is appropriate to play with (fuck up) which brings me to my =

come on, jungle was made to fuck up, RIGHT!? <br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; =
&gt;&#009;No, jungle was not &quot;made to fuck up&quot;, and certainly =
not in the mixing<br>&gt; &gt;&#009;sense. I can't think of too many =
things worse than hearing a bad<br>&gt; &gt;&#009;jungle dj trainwreck =
through a mix. sheesh.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Well of course! <br>&gt; I =
didn't mean fuck up =3D poorly mix. DUH! I mean, who the fuck wants to =
hear<br>&gt; trainwrecks!? I meant fuck up =3D mix up, cut back and =
forth, make the tracks<br>&gt; sound different than they do normally. =
&nbsp;In my opinion, jungle is the perfect<br>&gt; kind of music to play =
around with in the mix. &nbsp;Of course those beats better<br>&gt; be =
DAMN TIGHT before you start playing around with them! <br>&gt; <br>&gt; =
Anyway, I guess not all big name djs aren't having fun, thats up to =
them.<br>&gt; All I was saying is that it seems to me that a lot of djs =

Hey Y'all,

	A quick note to point you to my web page, in which I have placed 
my first track for '97 in Real Audio format, sampled once at Broadcast 
quality (requiring at least Dual ISDN bandwidth) and once at 28k modem 
Stereo quality.  The tunes is in it's pre mastered stage on the site 
right now, so the EQ is not 100%, but I will put up the properly mastered 
version as soon as it's done.  Please check it out and lemme know whatcha 
think of it.

http://www-mmc.hsls.pitt.edu/T/html/sounds.htm

A note for breaks list technical threads ... I made this whole track on 
my Win95 machine using Turtle Beach Soundcards, SoundForge and Cool Edit 
95. Quality right out of the machine is very nice.  Now I just need to 
find out how to mix down to separate tracks 'cause the soundcards only 
have a single out.  I have a fostex DA-88 8 track digital tape deck to 
use for mix down, if only it synced to a midi signal!

Regards,
Toby
                                             Tea

 The answer is that as far as I know, No. The promoter moved down south
 and she got married. At least that's what I heard. Why this party has
 been on the ROM so long probably has to do with Trout Soup not being on
 the list since this has been a fact for at least 2 months. If you are
 looking for something fun to do on the 18th I suggest the birthday party
 that Stephanie posted about.

well on the rom that just went out, i left a warning to call the info line
first, you did tell me that she moved, then someone else told me that some
info lines in pgh mentioned presale tix for it??!  this sort of thing has
happened before where parties were rumored to have been cancelled.  short
of hearing definately that it is cancelled, i leave them on the rom but put
a warning at the beginning of the text for the listing.  that way i have
all bases covered :)   ....   i'm kinda torn now tho, the bday party in pgh
is close, but i know the guy throwing the party in cowtown and it looks fun
too!!   well i guess its better to have more choices than not enough!  :P

ttfn, trouty

welp just got back from my trip from cali. it was to say the
least very refreshing. nothing beats spending some quality
time w/ yur girley in a climate twenty degrees warmer than
dreery O-Hi-O. i'll spare y'all the fluffy details & get to
responding to some posts...

someone asked how NYE wuz in other cities...

welp as luck would have it, we missed the Cool World Party
in San Fran, turned out Lisa, the girl who we were s'posed
to stay with met w/ some unavoidable problems back @ home
in detroit & was unable to return in time for us to hook up
with, so we ended up stayin @ my cousin's place in san fran.
however what seemed like bad luck at the time later turned 
out to be good fortune later on...apparently the Cool World
Party wuz busted around 4am in the morning...here's a review
of it from SF-Raves...

=========( Cool World Review from SF-Raves )================

10:00 and it's time to start up the laser in the main room. 
On stage, on the runway, the crowd was being entertained by 
teeny-boppers, with the DJ way far from the front of the 
stage. Then comes the live performances.. o boy. They we're 
pretty good at that lip-syncing thing, besides that, they 
sucked. 

11:30ish, they're done performing (yay!), and Dj Ghost is 
on. I've only heard ghost a couple of times, and both times 
he's started his set with my oh-so-(un)favorite phone sex 
record. After that record had been playing for about a 
minute, I notice 3 new people on the runway, giving the 
crowd their own live (clothed) sex show.... lovely. After 
this, the stage becomes packed full of scantily-clad 
teeny-booppers, strutin their stuff all over the stage (some 
of them earned a few bucks, too, probally for showing the 
crowd their g-strings). H

Happy New Year! Balloons fall, someone rambles on the mic 
about the new year, and a bunch of other unintelligable 
stuff.
1:30a, the theater is packed full of people, and some fool 
decides it's time for fun with the fire alarms! Managment 
gets mad, closes the theater, and the chill room soon after.

Main floor is now packed. People are hot and pissed, but the 
night goes on.

Somewhere between 3:30 and 4, the lights start coming on. 
Guess what! An early night! At the time, I was very excited. 
So the all the lights are on, but the music keeps going. I'm 
walking around asking security whats going on, and noone 
knows... big suprise. Finally one of the staff security 
dudes starts telling Garth it's time to stop, party's over. 
It took a bit of yelling for Garth to stop. I asked one of 
the management people why the party was shutting down, and 
find out Cool World broke their contract with HJK, because 
they didn't have any medical teams on duty. That's not the 
story the crowd heard, however... they we're all told it 
was because people had kept pulling the fire alarms. 

Now the fun begins. 

Incoming! The first bottle hits the stage... the next thing 
you know, they're coming at us from all angles. I rush to 
protect the equipment, while ducking behind road cases, to 
avoid the next juice bomb. Over the speakers, we keep 
hearing the words "patience" and "peace" over and over. Too 
bad noone cared. The bottles kept flying in for the next 
20-30 minutes, weird purple juice stuff and glass flying 
everywhere. We keep wondering where the cops are. Finally 
two cops are backstage, and I find out there's a lot more 
officers in the front of the building (great place for them 
to be, while we're all getting attacked). Well, finally 
20-30 cops come in backstage, dressed in full riot gear, and 
get almost everyone out.

We clean the weird purple juice stuff off the gear, pack it 
up, and leave.

Definatly the most interesting New Years I've ever had.

The End.

=============( End Cool World Review from SF-Raves)=========

however apparently the Cloud Factory Party in San Fran went
off pretty well, here's the review from SF-Raves...

=============( Cloud Factory Review from SF-Raves)==========

High Points-

-A very unique space. An indoor rock-climbing facility. Wow! A nice 
change of pace from some of the dirtier places to party around the Bay 
Area.

                                                                                
-The shredded-up rubber material on the floor inside the place. (Like 
someone threw some CLEAN old tires in a giant blender?). A very 
refreshing surface to dance on -- footing not TOTALLY solid, but my 
normally concrete-weary knees were in heaven from the nice cushy effect. 
The stuff was great to just chill in, too. And it's a good thing, too. 
Spent a great deal of the night just sitting w/ my fiance, who was 
feelin' ill all night :(

-*Perfect* capacity. Especially for a New Years event. (no way was I 
personally ready to deal w/ a Cool World-size crowd!!) About 350 or so
is 
the number someone @ the map point told me. Plenty of elbow room, and 
actually being able to RECOGNIZE people!!!

-The beats were intense! It was cool to hear some hardcore, some drum n' 
bass. The set immediately following the countdown was very eclectic,
very 
cool. But Cloud and whoever was spinning w/ him between 2 and 4 really 
tore it up!!

-The crowd was awesome, very vibe-oriented it seemed. Kept reminding 
myself that this is why I went w/ a relatively underground party this 
told us numerous times to not smoke where we were (the rubber was highly 
flammable). All that had been done was a pipe was packed (in preparation 
for the windy outdoors) and someone flashed a lighter to find something 
in their backpack. Straight up being called a liar when I told the guy 
that "NO ONE had approached me or my friends all night and told us not
to 
smoke" and "Sorry" and "We weren't even planning on it". They still 
took some convincing after all that. Still a mystery to me how they got 
confused.

-The outdoor area was being blown about pretty heavily, a little too
much 
to be enjoyable -- the tent raising off the ground, only shelter being 
the "Chill Trailer". Only reason this was dissappointing was I built up 
the idea of a spacious outdoor/patio area too much. Nobody can help the 
weather, though.

Nothing much more to bitch about. All in all, one of the most enjoyable 
parties I have been to this fall/winter. Cloud Factory, give yourselves
a 
BIG hug for this one.

                                                Hugs :)
                                                DAVE


-Swear to god there were multiple narcs there. Did anyone else sense
that
============( End Cloud Factory Review from SF-Raves)=================

so one bad party & one good party in san fran. but as fate would have 
it, we ended up in San Diego for NYE...did the SF NYE last year, thought
we'd try a new scene this year...unfortunately there weren't any good
raves in San Diego on NYE & we were actually thinking about hitting the
party in LA, good thing we missed that too (stevie's luck of missing all
the bad partys pays off again!)...but apparently the San Diego
rave scene has diminished somewhat...talked w/ one of the old skool
San Diego promotors (who just so happens to be dating one of my sisters
in San Diego) and he said due to ugly promotor wars & promotors narcing
on each other & busting each other's partys, the rave scene in San Diego
ain't what it used to be...most of the old skool San Diego ravers have
retired & just do the club thing now...which is what we did...lotsa fun
...lotsa alcohol...lotsa dancing (altho it seems the west coast scene
seems a bit lagging in this category, but it may be due to my overly
progressive choice of dancing)...good to finally have met Jon Bishop at
his club (altho i don't think he remebered from when i used to talk to
him on Prodigy way back when)...but we had the best time outside of the
scene...outdoors...checking out the beaches...hiking around Balboa Park
...the San Diego rave scene may be lacking, but the San Diego nature
scene more than makes up for...plus that was exactly what we were looking
for some place to get away from it all and San Diego fit the bill perfectly!
tee hee, trevor lamont wuz looking for leidra in ohio, we were looking for
her in San Diego, since that's where she's originally from.

as far as NYE in other places, talked w/ Ronnie last night about his big
party - An Escapade in Trance in Dallas...i guess that didn't go off as
well as it should have either...apparently a rival promotor hacked their
way into the party's voice mail line & changed the directions to go to
his party, so only 2500 kids showed up to the actual party and the rest
of the 5000 kids went to the wrong party. not only wuz the competing
promotors party bunk but it also got busted...now ronnie and urb magazine
(the party's main investor) is filing a federal suit against the competing
promotor!

welp on the upside ian mariano called me up & said he's got a new place
w/ his girley, e me if u need his new #.  and lady ms. lisa called me up
to tell me she got the car that i wuz dreamin for...the Rav4...we should
be breaking it in this weekend when we roadtrip down for MUVMENT...the
west wuz fun, but now we're itching for some good ole midwest vibe!

Regarding that post on GLACIAL EFFECT..u prolly cant get in at the door
without a ticket if your under 18 is all, but you can prolly get a ticket
without showing ID is what im thinking.

This is Terrel Paynes PawtE and he really hasnt been promoting it that much
for some odd reason.. i hope he has comfirmed his djs cuz i saw adairs name
on that post the same night for that birfday paWtE...???????????????? i
hope with all this talk boostin adairs rep that she can make it to a party
shes been booked at!

But i assure u this venue is Phat ..ive been there...it off of Rt. 51
somewhere is all i will say.
as to why so much $$ *shrug* i couldnt tell u a definate reason. hes not
expecting a HUGE turn out...
but his lineup is decent and i feel good supporting him cuz hes not about
stealing your $$. if you want to go to this spread the word cuz like i said
hes been stingy with flyers.

Sorry - can't say I'v seen anything with Swamp on it coming up...but I
wouldn't necessarily know.

Anyway - this reminded me - anybody know if Dj Prizm is still around in
pgh?  He had some phat chicago house + minimal techno this summer at a
couple of things, but I haven't seen his name around recently. Anyone?

okay...thats YOUR opinion. does size really constitue quality is what i was
implying. but it IS simple mathematics that tell me and most people that
the less people you have..the more$$ you will have to ask to make ends
meet. personally, i would rather spend the money for a safe secure location
in a *new* space than perpetuate the cycle of populational growth through
easier access to the underground.:P

LOOK. dont go if you dont want to go. not that many people talked shit on
phils party which he shoved in your face as THE party to go to if you
wanted to be a "better" raver and then dicked over everyone supporting him
with $$ and then managed to fuck everything with dj PR as well. you know
how many out of town djs DONT want to play in pittsburgh becuz of delphi?
Does local talent constitute a cheap party? if your throwing a party.. you
will recognize that the venue more times than not  is the primary $$
concern. not dj transportation and reputation. i could be wrong, but if i
am, does it really matter to me that someone who judges the quality of the
party right off the bat by the price and the locality of the lineup is
talking shit on it? pfffffffft :P

yes, i admit i am a sarcastic bastard.  but no, i do not agree that you
should charge more money if you are expecting less people.  if you are
throwing parties in order to make money than you are in it for the wrong
reasons anyway.  there is a difference between covering your ass and just
plain overcharging.

i'm sorry.  i had enough sense not to go to delphi in the first place.

yes.

i never said i was judging the quality of the party.  no one could do that.
however, i have the right to question the intentions of someone who charges
that much for next to nothing, in my opinion.

>***********************************

i wasn't planning on going.  thank you.

>things cost money. deal. complain about your financial situation on a
>different medium please.

really?  how did i manage to "talk shit" AND complain about my financial
situation in a three sentence post?  

>yes this is an expensive party, comparitive to other things you can do that
>night. stephanie posted something about a house birthday party. check that
>out. but dont bring the attitude you displayed to it though.

wasn't planning on attending either.

>btw, this isnt the first time ive been spammed for letting people know
>whats going on. sorry for being a messenger Jeff. forget i invited you.

i'm sorry if you felt personally insulted.  this guy is obviously a friend
of yours.  i feel anyone would question the ethics of someone who charges
that much for a lineup of nealy all locals and three dj's from the same city
who are not "big names."  

now let's just be hypothetical here.  let's say he is paying $500 for the
space (which he is probably paying less).  $800 in dj costs (which he is
probably paying less).  $400 for lights and sound (which he is probably
paying less).  and $200 for security and promotion and other various
expenses (of which there are probably little).  that adds up to $1600.  at
$18 a pop, he only needs *89* people to break even!  hell, let's say this
even costs $3200 (which i can almost guarantee it doesn't).  a whopping
*178* people to break even.  what this constitutes to me is one thing: a ripoff.

i understand that things cost money.  i also understand this party will not
cost a lot of money to produce.  furthermore,  i understand that this party
costs far too much for what it offers.  

charge a party for what it is worth, plain and simple.  

on my original (three sentence) post, i tried not to be offensive in stating
my views by stating my objections as questions, not just a "well this is a
rip off, don't go."  i guess that didn't help. 

hope it is a good time, honestly...

--jeff/stuff (that guy)

p.s. i don't mean to ruin anyone's credibility.  as stated before, these are
both of our opinions.  anyone can choose to go to these events or not.  i
obviously don't have to display what mine was, eh? :)

:) your reply and opinion is well respected, ordinary and expected. you're
not out of line when questioning why the price is high, but i never said he
wasnt planning on making $$.that his JOB. its not a hobby to him. your
right about it not costing that much. hes thrown next to nothing gigs at
houses which people had a great time at.
but how could you say that he is "ripping you off" when he has much more
time and responsibility than you invested in providing this environment for
us to go to ?

you can sit back away from it all and tell anyone that theyre ripping you
off. but ive noticed that its not smart to listen to anyone that will rip
on a party they have no affiliation with, especially BEFORE the party has
even happened, without knowledge of WHO the hell is throwing it, WHERE the
fuck it is, HOW he has promoted for it (vibe related), and WHY the fuck
they're throwing it.
if you are famialar with adk and theyre previous events, then your opnion
would weigh a little heavier. (and hes giving me a budget statement.
imagine that?!!)

to counteract such a blind denial of integrity you have displayed to my
friends, i feel obligated to tell you all why a lot of people WONT consider
this party a ripoff..

here goes:

_____budget adjustments to jeffs underestimations________
fyi>> the venue is charging at a flat rate + $5 a head. the more people
that show up, the more the place will cost. not to mention an insurance
down payment.
fyi>>Don from wiz. workshop charges $350 for 10,000 W. thats sound for ONE
room.
fyi>>security costs $8/hr multiplied by three people for 10 hours=$240
im not sure about spectrum or any of the djs but  dont think for one minute
that the djs dont expect any money from him just cuz theyre from pittsburgh
without a reputation and can find theyre way to the place. everyone charges
something.
--------------------------------------------------

he wont lose money. he probably will make $$. thats his business. some
people dont realize that others in the scene, escpecially the ones who MAKE
things happen, dont consider it a hobby. preparing weeks and sometiems
months to give you ambience is a promoters job, and it is WORK. work
requires compensation. if you want to be nosey about where that money is
going..its to partly compensate the promoters valiant efforts and enable
him to continue satisfying return costumers, which he has, like many other
businesses, like many other promoters.

but thats his business..what do you care..you just want to have a good time
right? why are partays so political to consumers? do economical decisions
have much bearing on your ethics? if they do, that implys money has a lot
to do with a good time. i remember being at bassrush iV complaining about
how expensive it was for such a vibeless party (to me).. that had a lot to
do with lies though. if you feel that a promoter has lied to you and has
been decietful, speak up. i dont think adk will ever be as decietful as
bassrush or candyman, becuz the people behind adk love to party and they
have a hype sense of whats good, whereas bassrush and other scammy
promoters have a good sense of whats hype.
------------warning: advertisement within--------------
***ATTENTION KMART SHOPPERS*** if you read the labels you will see there
are 16 djs.  if you can get your ass to a record store one day beforehand,
thats 94 cents per act you are paying. thats a bargain! i bet most pgh
ravers havent seen half of them. probably more than half. i ve bet theyve
heard of half of them. ill bet more than half dont know the LTV crew from
allentown. nows theyre chance to see local talent in action. youve heard
rave reviews of adairs accomplishments. smartie has skillz. smoov and
ruffian have experience. hell, on my personal taste level; if you havent
heard TIK TAK spin yet shame on you.
--------------------------------------------------
so, on a consumers standpoint, which is more or less where youre coming
from, i dont see any blatant attempt to rob the raver. there is no hype
involved here either. no glossy flyers, no big name djs. does that make
this event empty and vibeless? cry conspiracy if you want to, but dont
disregard the fact that exposure to art and ambience is what youre buying;
which in many cases is proven to be priceless. the $20 someone spent at
delphi went right into phils pocket and left it in the spirit of
entrepenuerism. the $15 someone spends at glacial effect will stay
underground and will leave adk's pockets in the spirit of raving.

        its much different than shopping for nuts and bolts from a hardware
store. one bolt is as good as the other, as long as theyre solid. you arent
considering how this bolt will change your life, or who you will meet, what
you will hear or what you will see differently as a result of buying this
bolt. these things arent considered. from a marketing perspective, bolts
have low intangible value. you need it. you buy it. you own it. you use it.
its there in your possession and part of your kingdom for awhile.
i dont think the bolt market fluctuates as fast as the party market does
either, but i could be wrong.

on the other hand, i can see many similaries as well, like how you use this
bolt could be a part of something meaniful and tangible, like if it was
part of a project for a present you give to your mom. but i think thats
stretching this metaphor way too far.

the fact that jeff jumped to a conclusion about the value of this party by
the price of it displays to me that hes a very logical guy who is plays it
practical and realistic and wants what he pays for. i bet hed be a fun guy
to go shopping nuts and bolts at a hardware store with. when it comes to
glacial effect however..i dont think he really knows what he conteplated
for maybe 15 seconds on buying as something intangible. maybe hes still
looking for that hype party made with "big name" (aka its past their time)
djs thats on sale on isle 13.

ive grown tired dicussing my views towards this ethical discussion. i dont
really care anymore. laugh at me please. im laughing at myself too...

just dont believe the hype. and go with the flow...im gonna have a kick ass
time at glacial effect. well worth my $15. i guess that makes me stoopid in
the average ravers mind. amen.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
hey all, this is Stephanie.  I'll be sending out an updated eflier for
"B-day" but first, clarifications.

No one knew there was a date conflict between Glacial Effect and
B-day until today.  Part of the reason we chose Sat was that with Seven
Blows concelled, we had a free date.  Regardless, when we saw the
conflict, we considered changing it to Friday.

We have decided to keep it on Saturday for several reasons, but we think
it's still going to turn out ok for all involved.  The crowds will
probably be pretty different considering the parties and vibes are so
different.  One party is free, all-ages, and accessible by public transpo,
and one charges, is (flexibly?) "18 and over," and I don't know where it
is--these are going to draw different demographics.  

Also, we realize there was what appeared to be a conflict with Adair being
double-booked.  I just got off the phone with her (she just got done
juicing veggies! ;) and has no doubt that she'll make it to both.  

Glacial Effects sounds like a lot of fun and i wish Tyrell and them the
best and regret conflicts for party-goers, but we still think they'll be
minimal. Regardless, if you're going to glacial, feel free to stop by
b-day before or after.

At the same time, if you're like me, you'll have a GREAT time at b-day.
Everyone I know who is going is excited about it.  We might have kids
coming over from Philly, and who knows, they might bring records.
You might see sneak dj debuts.  Many of the DJs appearing are the
city's most innovative.  There will be neat goodies like crayons and
things to color, art on the walls, celluloid majik, I see cake
and candles in my crystal ball, and other surprises I can't mention just
yet.  ;)  New ideas pop up every day and we're leaving room for
serendipity...if something neat comes up, we'll put it in.  The goal is to
throw a party that we would want to go to.

This party is full of surprises.  Even I won't know everything that's in
store until it happens.  :)  Basically, it'll be low-key, free form, 
kind of experimental, and fun.  If you're into that, you'll have a good
time.  Btw, this post isn't supposed to try to compete with Glacial
Effects, just explain the ideas behind B-day so you'll be more informed
about how you decide to fill up your Saturday. :)

Paper fliers are done, and the updated eflier will have an expanded
line-up, hints about extra goodies, and directions by PAT transit.

Much love, 
stephanie

O.K., now that January 18th has gone from "nothing to do" to "how can I do
it all", I have one more thing to throw into the pot.  I will be at
Projekt Haus later on in the morning, 'cause I like BEER and can probably
drink one there, since I'm old enough to buy a six pack and don't have to
worry about some security guy telling me I can't bring it in to the party. 
I like Guinness with my Jungle (hehe). 

However, I got a call a couple of days ago from the owners of the Lava
Lounge on the South Side and they asked me to spin a set on Saturday to
see how drum 'n bass goes over with the regular Saturday crowd that
frequents the Lava Lounge.  So, as if there isn't enough other stuff going
on that night, I'll be at the Lava Lounge spinning some Jump-Up tracks for
those of you over 21 and interested in the club scene.  MORBEUS will also
be spinning with me, and will start the night off with some Hard House, so
things should run fairly smoothly on the dance floor. Also, there may be a 
well known guest MC'ing it for me on the mic, if he gets off from his 
undercover cop-killin murder rap number (too much of a hint?)...

If you happen to be on the S. Side before heading out to do other things 
for the evening, stop by the Lava Lounge on East Carson St. and have a beer 
with me on my birthday night before taking off, or stay the whole night and 
I'll give you a ride to Projekt Haus for the afta party!

The Lava Lounge has a $3 cover.
Projekt Haus b-day party is free, or small donation.

Hope to see y'all somewhere in our busy city (*surprise*) that night...

Uh oh ... this doesn't happen to include "Moving Shadow" evening wear 
does it? (*Just being a snide bugger here ... too little sleep last night*)

I'm also planning on bringing the video projektor, so if anyone has some 
favorite videos to mix in, bring 'em (already watched the Aeon Flux 
tape at the last party, but I'm sure there's plenty of other trippy 
cartoons to put up on the walls).

Kids - about Galacial - chill!  Its apparent people have different
philosophies - no need for 10K+ messages.  Pitt is cheap so I get
constand mailbox overflow. :P

Anyway must say: ADK is cool - had several good times with them before and
I doubt they're out to rip you off.  The Dj's I'v heard in the line-up
are *good*, and worth hearing, and I'd probably go if there was nothing
else goin' on.  As Pete said - its not the line-up, but the vibe that
makes a good party.

BUT: $15/18 is pretty steep.  I understand the economics (though not the
part about keeping it DL & not flyering), but for something trying to be
'underground' as opposed to "commercial", $15 is kind of high for kid
raver.  

Thats it - have phun all whatever ya do.
Hopefully the cops will be at home this weekend. :)

 l8s,

that is a crock.  *every* promoter must work months in advance to make a
party happen.  this is part of being a promoter.  it doesn't make him high
and mighty.  if a promoter works months in advance to consistantly throw
crappy parties at $20  a pop, would you still go to them?

being from cleveland, i have heard him spin many times.  i'm not going to

i guess that's where we disagree then :).

from this point i had gathered that you saw raves as merely products that we
pay for and receive as a consumer.  then, you turn down a completely
contradictory path:

well, in the end what i see is a nice guy defending his friend.  that is
okay.  i don't think either of us are going to change anyone's mind either.
i guess i was just in the mood for an argument.  there will always be wack
parties and wack promoters.  i plan to help change that in the near future.
the value of any given party is different depending on who yu talk to.  it's
obvious that our ethics are on completely different levels.  anyhhow, i hope
it is a good time, once again. 

good day.

Y'know, I listened to that whole tape trying to find some usable samples, 
and other than some nice vocal snatches, I couldn't find any musical 
stuff worth grabbing.  Everything has either some orchestral melody 
noodling around in the background, or some kind of choral stuff.  If only 
some of the nice ambient stuff underneath was left exposed at some point 
in the episodes.

Definitely bring some Anime.  Whatever you think is good for the party 
vibe.  We also watched "Overfiend" at the last party, but other than 
that, anything you bring will be something different.

i'm away at school, and am out of 
touch with the goings on of the pittsburgh
rave scene these days.  my only connection
to what's happening is this list.  i haven't
gotten any mail from this list in ages.
no roms, no nothing.  is the scene totally
deminished in pitt?  what gives?
somebody say something about anything.
send chain mail if you have to.  just let
me know that there is indeed somebody else
on this baren wasteland of a list.

love,
ryu

Just thought I'd shed some light on the subject of being removed from the
list.  A while back, yours truly was working on the archives and
accidentally wiped the list... my apologies.  However, from time to time
people's mailboxes will be full or your server will be down for a couple
of days, and your email address starts bouncing.  My unofficial policy was
that when an address started bouncing, I would remove it.  So if suddenly
you stop getting email from the list, just check to make sure you're still
on it> send majordomo@hyperreal.com a "subscribe pb-cle-raves" message.
It won't subscribe you twice.  If you're still on the list, it will tell
you.  If you're not, it will add you.

PS: List ownership of pb-cle-raves will be changing soon.  I've found
someone to take over the list.  In that transition period, please be aware
that requests might not be processed immediately.  However, the list
address and all details regarding subscribing and that like will remain
the same.  Mail traffic will not be interrupted.

Particularly when mail servers decide to crash, and the dropped e-mails 
aren't set back on their way (case in point:  Telerama's ivory.lm.com).

Subject: QT Turntable

Hi! Would you please forward this to your list?

I have something exciting to tell everyone who's wanted to be a DJ but
couldn't afford to buy a whole DJ setup..

My brother and I have written a program that simulates a turntable using
quicktime technology on a powerPC MacOS machine.  We're in early alpha,
and we're looking for testers.  The program does work.  You can mix with
it.  Since I got a turntable for the holidays, I've been able to
practice spinning using my mac.. it's fantastic!

Would you like to take a look at this program?

on February 28th, 1997

  State College, PA

 INFOBASS presents

a party in support of the underground....

             __ALEXI DELANO__
(Loop & Plumphouse Records, Stockholm Sweden)

        __DAVID HOLLANDS__
                New York City

            __AQUAFRESH__
                Rochester, NY

     and infobass resident
         __WILL EVOLUTION__


 this will be a small intimate affair with the emphasis on music instead of
the attitude.
State College is a prime spot for the growth of a scene, with the problems
rooted in finding suitable venues within the town. So, all profits will go
to the artists who opened their space to our cause.
There are a limited number of tickets available, most of which will be sold
at State College.
Therefore, if you feel u MUST be at this event because of its tight vibe,
more information will be available by the end of the week at the URL below.
Follow further directions there for reservations. *tHanK yOu*

My name is Gyrate (Gabe James) and I am looking for LIVE PA bookings
for the year of 1997.  Recently I have been performing live in the
Southwestern United States as well as Florida.  Currently, I have a
promotional 12" release on DJ Huggie and Chagia's "Global Energy Musik"
(LA).  This 1997 print is an advance copy containing my track "Electric
Storm," and is strictly in promotion to reach distributors, magazines,
and DJs worldwide.

	I would like to reach interested promoters who are willing and able to
book my LIVE PA for their upcoming events.

	Please contact me at the following:

		E-mail: <system22@cris.com>
				*When E-mailing please subject your message as Gyrate*

		Fone: (505) 896-3177


								Kind Regards,

									Gabe James

here's my views on the brrrrrrrrrrr'y  evening:

man was it coooooold!

aside from that though, i couldn't have asked for anything more.

Titonton was rocking the place when we got there.  i had no idea that his
pa's had gotten so banging!  this was one of the best pa's i had ever
witnessed.  it had very many styles to it.  the obvious banging element (no
pun intended) that i just mentioned, the lush melodies that he is more known
for, and subtle experimentation.  everything i love about techno all wrapped
up in a one hour live performance.  watch out for this man, everybody.  

i agree with allroy that akilah bryant was not too impressive, especially
from what i had heard about her.

then came her husband, dj skull.  i enjoyed his set very much, even though
there were problems to begin with.  it started out slower and got much more
tracky by the end.  i enjoyed him a lot more than i thought i would.

then came rob hood.  being an *immense* fan of his, i expected nothing more
than supreme greatness.  what i got was an eluding, dark, creepy set.  i
loved it.  for some reason, however, i seemed to think that he was capable
of more.  as i watched he seemed not to be enjoying himself very much, often
shaking his head at mixes or song selection.  he was having a great time
beforehand (not that i was stalking him or anything.  who, me?)  but i think
he wasn't very happy about his performance.  i nonetheless enjoyed it,
especially when he played around with two copies of "the pace" and any other
time he dropped one of his own tracks.

one thing i noticed unique about hood's deejaying methods was that after he
put his record on and cued it up, he would immediately go to his crate and
arrange for what was next all while listening to the mix in his headphones
and occasionally adjusting the pitch on the record.  basically, he was
killing two birds with one stone.  i realized that this would save a lot of
time but also would require a large amount of concentration.  nonetheless,
it was something that i just noticed.

next up, and certainly the overall highlight, was stacey pullen.  this guy
has not ceased to amaze me each of the three times i have seen him!  played
for just over two hours.  i danced my ass off, which is something i haven't
done in quite a while.  i spent most of his set in front of the speaker,
which i *never* do!  anyhow, his set had so much substance to it.  ethereal
dreamy layers of melody at times, pounding intense techno at others.  it
started out housey even.  it was just great, i couldn't have been more pleased.

kimyon and pery ellis both did good jobs of winding the party down.  my feet
were too busy begging for heat for me to really give accurate reviews of
their sets.

THE LIGHTS:

perfect for me.  my ideal setup, two roboscans (or something like that) on
each side with a laser in the middle.  nothing more.  fantastic.  good
programming too on both.  

THE SOUND:

some people seemed to complain that it was too soft.  i thought it was fine
as long as yu were halfway up from the back (or the front, depending on how
you look at it :))  it was a bit soft compared to most parties, but most
parties have waaay too loud of sound anyway!


anyway, it was a perfect evening for me except for that damn cold weather!
i don't mind gettin a little dirty if it means hearing some quality techno
all night...

I hope when I finally get out of this frigid wasteland I don't feel the 
same way.  I mean, what is it about Pittsburgh that makes y'all miss 
it?  Is it the friends you left here, or the city itself?  Is it the 
raves and the clubs, or the scene that happens inside those places?  Just 
curious, 'cause I'll be in the same situation, soon.

If only collectors 12 wasn't gone....ahh well. 
A cool record shop that I think many people forget about is Jerry's
Records, which used to be in oakland (where dave's music mine is now), but
now is in Squirrel Hill (on Forward I think...its on that hill about a
block up from the BP).  Its almost 100% used stuff of all kinds - they
have loads of dance music now - not necessarily good - but if you dig hard
enough you'll find some gems.  They have a small hip-hop section, and have
singles/remixes mixed in with the "soul/r&b/dance" section.  They also
have lots of cool novelty recs!!  If you ask nicely they'll play stuff for
you.

Also for hip-hop - try Stedifords (sp?) on the North Side - a pretty good
selection from what I can tell (i'm no hip-hop expert).  Its on East Ohio
st, within a block of the Mellon Bank.  They have a turn-table fo
listening.

Then there's FutureSounds - of course its in forest hills, but its really
easy to get to if you have a car - definitly the best selection on
techno-dance-jungle-etc. in the area.  Plus they're cool enough to
underwrite WPTS. <plug :)> You can listen, but you have to buy like one
out of every 10 you listen to or something.

sorry bout' the length kids.

l8s,
  Geoff

i've heard wonderful things about The Attic (no, not the frat boy bar in
oakland....) Where is it?  and there's First Class Records in Wilkinsburg.
And rumor had it Collector's 12" was supposed to reopen in the Strip

I don't know about collectors 12, but The Attic (i believe) is in an area
called Millvale, which i guess one would describe as an eastern part of
the northside, but its not really connected.   I'v still never been there
tho.

The Attic in Millvale?  Go there.  Excellent store, good music, and good 
prices on 12"s.  I even found a buttload of Information Society 45's 
there for a buck apiece!  Well worth the trip into Millvale..

participate in the only event that seeks to unite all netravers of the 
northeastern U.S.  The lineup consists entirely of Djs active on the net and 
the party itself was organized exclusively through internet communications 
by a dedicated group of netters.  This is a celebration of the very 
technology you are using right now. 
		This is not a party you want to miss.

Advance tickets are now available by direct mail order and will be 
available through local netters in your area soon.  We are also taking 
requests for personalized stickers.

	Please order your tickets and badges well in advance to help us 
fund all the extra tech-goodies we have planned for you..  ; )

(note: these are not normal tickets, they are laminated, individually 
numbered, flyer-style tags made with the intention of being kept 
forever.  They will serve as an "admit one" and are considered tickets in 
every way, the personalized stickers are for netters only (sorry to the 
friends of netters).  Please do not order a personalized sticker unless 
you have bought ticket.

  State College, PA

 INFOBASS presents

a party in support of the underground....

             __ALEXI DELANO__
(Loop & Plumphouse Records, Stockholm Sweden)

        __DAVID HOLLANDS__
                New York City

            __AQUAFRESH__
                Rochester, NY

     and infobass resident
         __WILL EVOLUTION__


 this will be a small intimate affair with the emphasis on music instead of
the attitude.
State College is a prime spot for the growth of a scene, with the problems
rooted in finding suitable venues within the town. So, all profits will go
to the artists who opened their space to our cause.
There are a limited number of tickets available, most of which will be sold
at State College.
Therefore, if you feel u MUST be at this event because of its tight vibe,
more information will be available by the end of the week at the URL below.
Follow further directions there for reservations. *tHanK yOu*

from the N take 71 S to the HUDSON st exit, go R.
from the S take 71 N to the HUDSON st exit, go L.
from E or W take 70 to 71 N to the HUDSON st exit, go L.

(i think hudson is exit #113, if that's helpful)

once on hudson, take it approx. one mile W to HIGH st, go L there and go S
on high st for about 1 mile to WOODRUFF (if you pass a wendy's on the L
you've just missed it).  take a R on woodruff and continue W past the
construction until woodruff becomes WOODY HAYES.  stay on woody, go under
a bridge and pass the next light which should be KENNY rd.  look for the
space on the L, it's the JESSE OWENS building, a large gym-style arena
which will be very warm and clean. 

admission is only $10 smackers, thanks to the fluid/e.r. cru for doing a 
cheap party :)

those of you who attended DARKSIDE 4 are already familiar with the space; 
this time, we are only using the smaller room and THERE WILL BE HEAT.

directions: 

from the N take 71 S to the 11th ave exit, go right
from the S take 71 N to the 11th ave exit, go left
from the E or W take 70 to 71 N to the 11th ave exit, go left

(11th ave is exit #112 i think)

once you are on 11th ave, go W for 1/2 mile.  just before going under a
railroad bridge, you will see several empty parking lots to the left. 
park there, or if full, there should be plenty of parking elsewhere
nearby, but PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU PARK and be very respectful of the
neighborhood.  this is not the best area, dont say we didnt warn you!

from the parking lot, the space is a 1/2 block walk.  continue going W,
under the railroad bridge, to the first light you see, which is the corner
of 11th ave and GRANT ST.  go LEFT on grant and walk inside the fenced-in
area (DO NOT PARK IN THE FENCED-IN AREA, THAT'S V.I.P. PARKING AND WE WILL
NEED IT).  you will see several warehouses inside this fenced-in area,
then look for the red building which is the furthest in back (the only one
with a loading dock), and follow the beats... 

doors open at 12mid, and the event will go till about 6am.  admission at
the door is only $6 and we are asking you to bring exact change if you
can.  also, keep in mind that although the space HAS HEAT, the floor is
concrete, so it may not get as warm as we'd all like...so dress warmly, 
and bring an extra layer of clothing or a blanket just in case. 

drive safe everyone, remember there are likely to be some crappy winter
conditions on your way here. 

any problems call the table of ele_ments at 614.470.0929

(thanks to tom for letting us use his space one last time...)

ben just reminded me that some of the radio shows are out of date at the
end of the R0M....  any updates, deletions, and/or corrections would be
appreciated.  also i'm sure the weeklies need a going over, those are
always a mess...  david said that the brillo pad charged him 4/5$ admission
last week.  is this the new price or was it just that week?  thanks!

This is just a quick note to thank everyone who helped bring me and other
Capricorns and Aquairians a great birthday, especially Michael, Stephanie,
Ed, Dan, Dave, and the rest of the Projekt Haus/TCRPS kollektiv, as well
as my friends from WPTS and WRCT who spun some great sets, or just dropped
a choice track or two at the right moment.  I had a great time on Saturday
night, chillin by the fire and celebrating with you all.  It's good to
know I have such great friends and I hope we can do it all again for each
of your birthdays!!! 

Also, Big-up 1.8.7., Sphinx, and JJ Dynamite for representin' at the Lava 
Lounge.  Let's hope that's one more club to support the Jungle!
 
much love,
Toby

i think trouty our rom man dabbles a bit. tom butcher, our ex-list
admin, not only is in his own techno group, but has his own record
lable (orbit records). dj ian mariano (the church/cleveland) also
makes trance tracks and has his own record lable. and i wuz there
when jeff/stuff bought his first synthesizer. but i think he just
plays around. nothing out on vinyl yet.

=====================================================================

=====================================================================

yes elemental (defintly not e-lemental since elemental is about thinking
about the music & not the drugs) and charles noel aka monochrome of
ele mental put out a series of mixed tapes of local talent entitled
the Fusion series. but i'll let ed tell u about those. if he's not
on this list anymore, u can e him at eluna@coil.com.

@#*%!

I've been trying to network with local pgh electronic musicians =
recently.  I sent out=20
an email to this list about a month ago, maybe you never saw it:

+++++
I am trying to network with people who are interested in =
IDM/electronica/ambient music in the Pgh area.  Please mail me at =
<skoop@galt.com> to discuss developing the local scene and/or making =
music.
+++++

I have had very little response.

I am VERY interested in the ideas of networking, producing a local tape, =
establishing a music-making scene, playing live, collaborating with =
other local people, etc.etc.etc.

Currently, I'm working with a partner, and we're trying to set up a =
regular weekly evening=20
at a local coffeeshop/whatever, to dj (alright, play cd's) of =
IDM/ambient electronica.
Hoping that this would develop some sort of following, we'd then try to =
move on to occasional live electronic performances.

I currently have a 9-track demo [skoop::datamation] (slightly old), and =
am slowly working on a second.  I create ambient/IDM/whatever style =
electronica.

Please contact me.

Hi everyone..
 
Every few months I pop by here here and tell you all what we've been up to..

For those of you who don't remember me, I'm in the band Skylab2000. We're 
based in Los Angeles and we play west coast trancy-acid-funky-breaks stuff
with plenty of wobbly acidic 303. More importantly, we play 100% live and play
at parties all over the country.

As far releases go, we've got a bunch of independant releases, (ZYX Germany,
Brainiak UK, Fatal Data US) plus tracks on Keoki's and Taylor's mix CD. 
There's a new track coming out very soon - details later.

Anyway, so far as news goes, we've got our redesgned web site up, so check it
out at http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/brainforest. We just got a new
domain all hooked up, so we'll be moving to Skylab2000.com in a few weeks.

Urb writes about us pretty often, which is very cool of them, and there's a
really nice picture of my partner and I in the current issue. They did an
interview with us for the next issue so look for some silly quotes in URB next
month.

We've also been playing out of town a lot. We've reecently been to the Chicago
area, Seattle, Santa Cruz, Phoenix and we're playing Fort Lauderdale this
weekend. Upcoming events include another Florida show and Vancouver.

Guess that's all the news for now. Check out our picture in URB, the URB stuff
next month, or the web site for more info and write me back if you are a
promotor and are looking for a live act to rock yer party.
 
peace

@#*%!

I've been trying to network with local pgh electronic musicians =
recently.  I sent out=20
an email to this list about a month ago, maybe you never saw it:

+++++
I am trying to network with people who are interested in =
IDM/electronica/ambient music in the Pgh area.  Please mail me at =
<skoop@galt.com> to discuss developing the local scene and/or making =
music.
+++++

I have had very little response.

I am VERY interested in the ideas of networking, producing a local tape, =
establishing a music-making scene, playing live, collaborating with =
other local people, etc.etc.etc.

Currently, I'm working with a partner, and we're trying to set up a =
regular weekly evening=20
at a local coffeeshop/whatever, to dj (alright, play cd's) of =
IDM/ambient electronica.
Hoping that this would develop some sort of following, we'd then try to =
move on to occasional live electronic performances.

I currently have a 9-track demo [skoop::datamation] (slightly old), and =
am slowly working on a second.  I create ambient/IDM/whatever style =
electronica.

Please contact me.

that would be me. 8) so far, we've got pretty good response at the
greenhouse in shadyside, and we should be in there by the end of the month
spinning idm once a week. kiva han, recently opened in oakland, is also
showing a somewhat favourable response, and we also plan to try
interstellar cafe on southside along with someplace else on southside i
currently forget. we eventually plan to move up to live pa's once we
figure out what we'd do together. :)
we figured that coffeehouses would be the best place to try because idm is
more suited to sitting and listening than dancing. hmm...anybody with any
suggestions?

>who on this list or that you know. is creating original techno music?

i've been seriously making electronic music for about a year now.
i do not-so-technoey hardcore, gabber, jungle, breaks, and stuff similar.
most of my music is either very dark and disturbed, or really
cheesy and video-gamey.  nothing really desginged for the dance floor
or to chill out either really.  i don't know.  
but i'd be interested in contributing to anything that would promote
orginal electronic artists (tapes, performances, etc...)
i'm already planning to get a cd pressed this summer of my stuff.
i, can't really perform live because most of my work is prearranged, 
and all i'd do is just press buttons every so often.
also, i am in school at state college right now, but will be home
to pitt for spring break and all summer.
please keep me informed as things unfold with this.  i'm excited.

love,
ryu

for those who are intersted in collaborating pittsburghs original
electronica, im really eager to see what comes of it. I 've been looking
for a good way to expose my tracks, (whenever i gather enough inspiration
to finish them!). Ive only dabbled with IDM or high energy based tracks
meant for dancing just recently. Most of what ive been doing is only
preparing me for that purpose; ive made a couple soundtracks to student
films, and a bunch of tracks for two different PC games. Also, i really
dont have much gear at all:( Thats why im still at college, becuz i have
access to lots o cool stuff! My sound is really commercial, which i have no
problem with, becuz im just experimenting :P i dont have a demo right now
becuz im lazy and most of my stuff is irreproducable and still needs work,
or i dont like it anymore.
        Ive met a kid named Sean very briefly who makes tracks at Duquense.
There are more techno artists attending there and aquiring degrees in
Electronic Composition than any other school in Pennsylvania. (too damn
expensive for me)
        Also, ive heard a bunch of Ryu's tracks, experimental breaks and
some gabber tracks i guess i would call it *shrug* he might be interested
in exposing them.
       i gotta go, but i am interested in donating a track to a
complilation, as long as its sold and distributed among friends, as sort of
an exposure thing. Also perhaps we can convince a dj at cmu to take a seat
for a night and have our music on instead.
        im glad someones talking about this, even if i wont be able to be
apart of it right now. I love pittsburgh and miss it, but its definately
missing a forum were electronic composers can share with others their art.
(unless im just aloof and  have no clue whats going on)

Two points here:

First is that, over on the Analogue Heaven mailing list, there's been a =
push to do a very
laid-back, low-budget kind of tape distribution list.  A very cool guy =
on the list apparently works in a tape duplication plant, and he's the =
organizer and facilitator of the compilation, in that he apparently gets =
bulk tapes for free through work or something, and can dupe them at no =
cost.  He's produced one tape this way, (see: =
http://ocsystems.com/~gse/yfo/ ),
and a second tape is in the making.  He asks for tracks from =
listmembers, doesn't edit
them for content or quality or anything, puts them to tape, somebody =
else volunteered the artwork, and then they were distributed via the =
mail free +shipping.  Something like this would appeal to me here.  I =
could even be coaxed into organizing/doing this, provided that everyone =
understand that I: a) have no time, b) have no money, c) do not own a =
DAT machine, d) have no easy way of making bulk copies of tapes, e) my =
day job is pretty important to me, etc.  I'd have to charge for the cost =
of blank tapes plus the cost of a color photocopy for the J-card.  =
Again, I don't really have the time to devote to this to do a
quality presentation, so if somebody else wants to volunteer to do this, =
that'd prolly be much better.  Contact me to discuss.

Second point regarding dj at cmu:

Anybody remember/ever listen to [.electronica] a couple of years ago, =
Friday nights on WRCT, after the TechnoTerrorists?  We need another show =
like that.  Tom Butcher (aka Bit) used to open the show, spinning his =
brand of upbeat digi-funk techno, and later, Brian Bozarth (aka Lunatik) =
and Jon Stevens (aka The Cleaner) used to spin intelligent/ambient =
techno until the wee hours of the night.  I used to hang out with these =
guys during their sets occasionally, and I really miss that show.  Tom =
was even good enough to play a few of my tracks on the air.  :-)  We =
need another show like that.  I don't know what's up with WRCT these =
days, but a couple of weeks ago, Geoff Maddock from WPTS wrote that he =
was thinking about a timeslot open to local DJ's (and hopefully =
producers).  I think that'd be great!

I'd like to second what Toby said. Thanks to everyone who came out to the
B-Day house party. I really had a great time and special thanks to Michael
@ the projekt haus for hosting it. and thanks to Stephanie for the idea
and the oranization of it. NIce job! Oh yeah, did anyone on the list go to
Glacial Effect?  Where was it, I heard it was in the Ardmore Roller
Palace, but since Pete said it was a new space that can't be where it was
since there have been at least two or three parties there. In fact the
first large-scale Pittsburgh rave was there back in '92, Power-Rave it was
called and Richie Hawtin, Heather Heart, Adam X and John Aquaviva spun. So
anyway, how was Glacial Effect, how was the sound, how was Adair's set?
How many people showed? How was the lighting, was the party worth $18?
Details, I want details.

Well you junglists out there should be proud to live in the city of steel.
I just found out that out of the Top 50 cities in the US we have more
radio shows that play jungle  than anywhere else. Something like 7 or 8.
on both WRCT and WPTS. We also have trhe longest running techno pirate
radio station, Radio Carson on 91.7 (try tuning them in if you are driving
around town, you'll be suprised) and coming later this winter Free Radio
Pittsburgh/Rinse-FM will probably be on the air on a regular basis (watch
this space). So radio doesn't suck in Pittsburgh after all. You just have
to know where to look and when to listen.

May I throw one more message into the b-day thanks ring? ;) 

This is the first event of this type I've ever helped put together and I
really, really want to thank everyone who helped.  All talent, space, and
equipment except for an inexpensive sound system rental was donated and
everyone who came did so in just the right spirit.  The music and visuals
were fantastic, every set was great...we're so lucky to have so much
talent around.  not only that, but organizing was very low-stress thanks
to very patient and easy-going djs and others.  Oh, I'm sorry for any
line-up confusion caused by ambiguity and the delayed startup of the
second room.  We tried to make sure that pretty much everyone who made a
request got somewhat what they asked for.  I hope no one went away
terribly disappointed.  :/

Six million thanks go out to Michael for basically taking on
probably half of the responsibility of the party, making very
sharp-looking fliers, and freely opening his beautiful home to what he
estimated to be about 75-100 people.  Nothing was broken or stolen.

I may have kinda guided the process along, but honestly, it wasn't that
hard.  Everyone was so willing to pitch in that once Projekthaus was
volunteered as a space, everything sort of fell into place.  This has a
lot to do with the fact that Projekthaus/Telecorps parties are not a new
phenomenon so a lot of planning was already in place.  Look for more of
their parties in the future.  It's always a rip-roarin' avante guarde good
time.  Also, Joe, Toby and Amie are great people with enthusiastic,
talented friends.  everyone should be lucky enough to have friends like
them.  But you knuckleheads already know I love you. ;)

Well, that's about it, except that I hope everyone had as much fun as I
did, it'd be fun to do it again sometime, and once again, waterfalls of
thanks to _everyone_ who lent, begged, barrowed, stole, projekted,
konfekted, spun, whistled, fed the fire in the fireplace, and shook booty
for making a good party for 3 good friends.

umm, my lazy and COLD ass didnt get to pittsburgh last weekend. so sorry i
have no details.
to be honest, as i gathered from most peoples reactions not just from this
list, it probably want worth it becuz people were expecting it not to be.
we see what we want to see i guess. Allz i know about the location is that
it was onff rt 51 somewhere, so it probably wasnt at Ardmore, but i LIKE
that space anyway, since i used to go tomiddle school roller skating
parties there along with 31 flavors. i think joe had a pa there:) that
party rocked for me. aiiight peace.

Hi all list friends!
I just have to make you aware of a great program some friends of mine (the
same guys who made the << ReCycle >> program) have just finished. It's
called ReBirth 338 and is a "computerized version" of the Groovebox, only
far better. With two 303's and a 808 drumbox you have all you need to make
great music. Throw in a delay and dist and you have ReBirth 338. I'm sorry
if it sounds like i'm "bought" but i've been fooling around with this
program constantly since i downloaded it. It's great FUN and a great
program.

You can download it yourself at: << www.propellerheads.se >>. The Demo
version is available for Mac PPC and Windows 95. I hope you'll have as much
fun as me.

Best Wishes >> Daggan >> Origin Records [Box 9223, 10273, Strockholm, Sweden]

Sorry, another hoax.  You can't recieve a virus via text.  If you get a 
file of executable code that you run without scanning first, that's 
another story.  Please see 'Good Times.'

on a weekly basis and the following discussion about them on any of the ~10

there is no such thing as deeyenda. the "virus" is the fact that people 
keep sending this email along like a chain letter eating up space on 
servers. not dangerous, just annoying (bandwidth blah, blah). FYI you 
can't get a virus from e-mail it just doesn't work that way. please do 
not keep forwarding this post. also tell those you know to not worry 
about deeyenda. its a big joke perpetrated on unsuspecting internet users.

Sorry I took up so much of some people's precious server space with 
the virus warning I recieved, I was just trying to be friendly and 
kind.  I wasn't expecting to catch so much negitivity and unKINDness 
back. All those who emailed me could have been a little bit more 
freindly when explaining to me that I have no idea of what I'm talking 
about and that I'm not as knowledgable as some of you.  I thought that 
the rave scene was supposed to be made up of free-minded, positive 
people, who are all suppose to be working together on PEACE, LOVE, 
UNITED  RESPECT.  Let us all take a good look in the mirror and see 
who we really are, and if we are really evolving or if its just a 
glorified deevolving spiecies.  

With that I say PEACE OUT, and don't worry I'm unsubscribing to 
pb-clev-raves mailing list.

o. i didn't know so many people are doing techno.
but to be clear, i wasn't talking for a IDM tape. i mean, anything techno.
if it has a cool beepin sound, and does that, mabye tweeks. thats techno to
me!
i do some IDMish stuff, but i pump out techno tracks. [2-4 a week]
not break throughs in lisenin' technialy advanced music.
its noisy sometime. feet stompin sometime.
alot like the stuff i spin as bleep [if anyone remebers hearin me [ain't spun
out i awhile, no oone ever asks me]
so, who has techno tracks [or exerpimental electronica/jungle]
that they would give to be put onto a small tape. [me? not me?]
if this brings out a new focus on live music in pittsburgh great.
wonderfull. i just wanna hear stuff being done by local people.
DJ's get way top much credit. they only mix, "my grandma can mix with some
practice" there only good if they're playin good tracks.
what about the people making the tracks? getting NO credit from the Dj who
spins em. i just wanna eleiminate the middle man.
so whos in, only tea said "i will send you some tracks for a tape"
there will be no fanceyness about this. no big distrapution, no big
promotion.
just ultraunderground techno.
the songs don't even need to be "finished"
some of my favorite tracks [by me or not] sometimes just end! not even on
beat sometimes, theres just no need to go on.
or it can be commercial house. its still techno, and someone had to work at
it.
ok thats really it.
sorry if i babbaled.
who will contribute songs? [one or more]
and tell me what they basicly are. gabber? great! minimal tech! great!
jungle! happy! satanic! tripped out! commercial! anything. it still rocks,
just cause you made it.

Don't worry about it.  You were just being cautious.  Your heart was in 
the right place.  It's no reason to unsubscribe just because you were 
concerned.  It's over and done with.  Have some Jolt.

awhile, just got back on...but i just wanted to say don't let a few
petty flames get to yah...hell, i'm one of the oldest fukers still 
on the net & some clueless kids still flame me...hell, i just got 
flamed yesterday on mw-raves...i'm used to it...trust me once u've
been on for awhile, u'll build up a natural flame retardent shield
...don't worry soon u'll be a pro cyberspace ravah like the rest of
us it just takes practice like with everything else.

plus if u are the joshua i'm thinking of, u used to be friends with
chinagrrrl and kirsten and matt and jill aka the ole E.P.T crew,
now the lovelight laser crew, u guys deserve to be on this list,
u guys more than paid...leave it to us ole fuks to remember it all.

life is like a roller coaster, its got it's ups, its got it's downs.

Right.  That's what I meant...I was just expounding on what I was into, personally.
I certainly wouldn't want to limit any local tape to just one type of techno.

>so, who has techno tracks [or exerpimental electronica/jungle]
>that they would give to be put onto a small tape. [me? not me?]

Like I said, I am totally into this.  I've got probably about 20 tracks that are mostly
finished, in several styles, from straight-up dancy techno to more ambient-ish electronica.  Take yer pick.

Lemme know what's up with this.  As I stated in a previous post, I could be talked into producing this if no one else wants to...

Subject: {pb-cle} new Daft Punk lp
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

hi there,

normally i do not duscuss the records that i've bought on this list (like
many others seem to be doing lately) but i feel that this is an important
piece of work here.

i just picked up the new Daft Punk lp, "Homework" on Virgin Records today.
It is slammin!  Now, the point of this message is not to talk about how
great the record is because most of us know that most of everything that
Daft Punk or it's better half Thomas Bangalter has put out slams anyway.
The point of this message is for all of you to get it through your heads
that techno music *will* break through this year to the masses.  

However, i do *not* want to get into another argument about techno becoming
"commercialized" or "selling out."  As soon as i had learned about Daft Punk
signing to Virgin nearly a year ago, i foresaw their debut as "the one."  I
mean, i can surely think of other techno lp's that beat the crap out of this
one, but that is not my point.  Nor am i trying to say that we will start
seeing Robert Hood on mtv or the Surgeon on the cover of rolling stone.
That is an entire different thing going on.  That goes along more with Mike
Dearborn's idea of "underground" which i believe will stick around for as
long as it's artists do.  BUT, this entire rave thing is just all over,
folks.  Expect to see many more Mountain Dew sponsored raves with outrageous
lineups and prices to go with it.  I, personally, have no problem with this.
In fact, it will more likely than not ensure a smoothly flowing event.  

Events like ele mental's and poorboy's will always be around.  These things
can coexist.  i am not saying that things like this will vanish.  This is
really my only reason for posting this:  anyone who thinks that they are
special or "underground" for knowing who Daft Punk or Josh Wink or Boo
Williams or any other big techno or house producer needs to WAKE UP.  This
is the beginning, not "the beginning of the end" as someone else posted on
this list about mtv's amp show or some other event about us "losing our
underground" or some other nonsense.

this was inevitable, and anyone who thought otherwise needs to reevaluate
what is going on in pop culture right now.  pants are getting bigger, shirts
longer.  most of the rock that is big right now involves electronics anyway,
it just isn't being used that well.  :)

it is also highly possible that i am wrong (don't worry, you all didn'thave
to tell me that).  *but* if not daft punk, then Goldie or Alex Reece or some
other artist who has been signed to a major.  it *will* happen this year, no
matter who it is.  actually, it makes more sense to me for drum n' bass to
hit the billboard top ten before daft punk does.  many articles were written
about it in major music publications last year.  anyhow, i am starting to go
on too many tangents.  

to reiterate once again, for most of you, "your" techno or "your" raves will
soon not be "yours" anymore.  

i, personally, am looking foreward to it.

	This is in response ta Jeff's letter that he wrote.
	First of all....I dont wanna sound rude, mean, or start some sort
of "e-mail fight" or whatever....but, you say that youre looking forward
ta "our" techno being commercialized.  I think youre nuts for wanting
this.  But since i also believe EVERYONE is entitled ta their own opinion
and views on things, im gonna state my reasons on why i think youre nuts
for wanting this.

> 
> to reiterate once again, for most of you, "your" techno or "your" raves will
> soon not be "yours" anymore.  
> 
> i, personally, am looking foreward to it.

	Now, i think all of us out there understand and realize that it
is inevitable for "our" raves ta not be "ours" anymore.  This has been
happening in Chi-Town for a few years now.  I think most of the old
partiers will agree with me upon this.  I remember going ta parties for
$5, $8 and there was a really strong, positive vibe going.  The people
were nice, we didnt have ta put up with all this promotion bull shit that
we deal with now. 
	Anyways.....Then I noticed that around 2 ta 3 years ago, we
started getting all these Freshman in high school and younger kids coming(
i remember at a party called "DYNASTY" that this girl brought her younger
sister and 2 of her sisters friends along, they were only in 6th grade!).  
	Im NOT AT ALL DISSING YOUNGER PARTIERS.  I want ta make that
fact clear.  But, I think a lot of people will agree with this part
too..that most of these younger kids that started going got this massive
attitude that they're the shit since they go ta "raves" and most people
out there dont go.  Now, I consider this ta be one of the reasons why the
vibe started going downhill.  
	i stated above that the people used ta be friendly....well, when a
lot of these kids with attitudes started showing up....I met fewer and
fewer people that were friendly and nice.  And I think that everyone out
there will agree with me that its nice and enjoyable ta be at a party
where the people are nice instead of them just being like, "im waay too
cool ta talk with you, ya freak".  
	NOw, ya want this scene ta become mainstream.....If anything, I
think the past DOES teach us something!  Do you really want more of these
kids with attitudes showing up?  
	Now secondly.........Im sure all of us remember when "grunge"
started hitting the airwaves nation wide.  And the "skater" look became
really popular.  Then "grunge" died and it became "alternative" which in
turn became "mainstream" music.  Now, if anyone knew skaters before all of
this happened i think you'll remember that they actually had their own
identity and that most of them didnt like the, lets call them the "newer"
skaters since they thought they were the shit just like our prob. with
a lot of the newer kids going ta our parties.  My point being that, with
"alternative" becoming commercialized, the masses of younger people stole
their identity.  Everyone started wearing the baggier pants and the whole
bit.  And it wasnt because this was "who" the kids were, but they started
dressing and acting that way because its the "cool thing ta do" or be.
Now personally, i consider the way i dress and appear ta be a reflection
of me and my personality.....not because its "cool".
	Now if our scene, or maybe i should say when our scene, becomes
commercialized these kids out there are gonna rob all of us of our
identity.  And some of us wonder why the original skaters have a hard time
with the "newer" ones.  
	Then thirdly and lastly, when music becomes reall popular, ya
start getting these bands with no talent or "good" songs getting popular
just because they sound similar ta well known artists.  Personally...one
of the worst things at parties is when a DJ spins into a track that
totally sucks and no one likes.  
	All of this comprises most of my reasons why our scene shouldnt
become commercialized and why we should keep up the fight ta stay
"underground" and non-commercialized....I dont want our scene that we
built out of nothing ta become trashed because some producer wants ta make
more money more quickly.
	I just wanna say again, that i mean no disrespect ta anyone out
there if ya started partying more recently...I have met some really cool
people out there that still have no clue as ta what a party actually
is...so im not stereotyping anyone.

	Peace and much respect ta EVERYONE out there.

 Jokes

1
        Mrs. Martin went to see her gynecologist before her fourth 
marraige.
After the examination, the physican seemed confused. "You are a virgin.
How is that Possible?"
        "My first husband was a psychiatrist," she explained.  "He
analyzed it all the time.  My second husband was an English teacher.  He
wrote about it all the time.  My third husband was a contractor and
always said he would get around to it.  But now I'm marrying a lawyer,"
she said with a smile, "so I know I will get screwed."

2
        A woman was shaking out a rug on the balcony of her 17th-floor
condominium when a sudden gust of wind blew the rug and the woman over
the railing.  "God, that was stupid," she thought as she fell. "What a
way to die."
        As she passed the 14th floor , a man standing at his railing
caught her in his arms.  While she looked at him in disbeleiving
gratitude, he asked, "Do you suck?"
        "No!" she shrieked, aghast.  He dropped her.
        As she passed the 12th floor, another man reached out and caught
her.  "Do you fuck?"  he asked.
        "Of course not!"  she exclaimed before she could stop herself.
He dropped her.
        The poor woman prayed to God for one more chance.  As luck would
have it , she was caught a thrid time, by a man on the 8th floor.  "I
suck!  I fuck!"  she screamed in panic.
        "Slut," he said...and dropped her.

3
        On receiving word of his wife's accident, John rushed to the 
hospital.
The attending physican assured him she would be OK but needed to spend a
few days in intensive care.
        "If I may make a suggestion," the medic said, "research has shown
that oral sex speeds up an ICU patient's recovery.  If you are willing,
we'll give you some privacy."
        John quickly agreed and curtains were drawn around the woman's
bed.  Two minutes later, buzzers and bells beckoned doctors and nurses to
the area, and they worked furiously to revive her.  Once she was
stablized the doctor asked John.  "What went wrong?"
        "I dunno," he said with a shrug.  "I think she choked.

4
        Little Johnny queried: "Dad, what's the difference between theory 
and
reality?"
        "Son," Johnny's father instructed, "go ask your mom if she would
fuck a stranger for a million dollars."
        Johnny did as he was told, then reported:  "Mom says she will do
it pop."
        "Okay," the father chuckled.  "Now pose the same question to your
sister."
        Little Johnny got the same response from his sister.
        "It's simple,"  Johnny's father concluded: "In theory, John, you
and I share a house with a pair of millionaires, but in reality, we live
with a couple of sluts.

There is a new commander of a base of the French Foreign Legion, and the
captain is showing him around all the buildings.  After he has made the
rounds the commander looks at the captain and says, "Wait a minute.  You
haven't shown me that small blue building over there.  What's that used
for?" The captain says, "Well sir, you see that there are no women around.
Whenever the men feel the need of a woman, they go there and use the
camel."  "Enough!" says the commander in disgust.

 Well, two weeks later, the commander himself starts to feel in need of a
woman.  He goes to the captain and says, "Tell me something, Captain."
Lowering his voice and glancing furtively around, he asks, "Is the camel
free anytime soon?" The captain says, "Well, let me see." He opens up his
book. "Why, yes, sir, the camel is free tomorrow afternoon at two 
o'clock." The commander says, "Put me down for two o'clock then."

So the next day at two o'clock the commander goes to the little blue
building and opens the door. There inside he finds the cutest camel he's
ever seen. Right next to the camel is a little step stool, so he closes the
door behind him and puts the step stool directly behind the camel.  He
stands on the stool, drops his pants, and begins to have sex with the
camel. A minute later the captain walks in.  "Ahem, begging your pardon,
sir," says the captain, "but wouldn't it be wiser to ride the camel into
town and find a woman like all the other men?"

An older gentleman was standing at a bus stop, observing a young man with 
orange, green, and blue spiked hair.

After a few moments, the young man said, "What's the matter, old man, 
haven't you ever done anything wild?"

The old man smiled and said, "Well, yes. I once had sex with a parrot, 
and I was wondering if you might be my son . . . "

--------------------------------------------------------------------

A man met his ex-wife at a party and after a few drinks asked her if she
would spend the night with him 'just for old times sake.' 'Over my dead
body' she replied.  'That's right' he smiled, 'let's not change a thing!'

Subject: A Little Birdie


A man was sunbathing nude on a beach and reading a newspaper.  He saw a
little girl walking towards him and immediately covered himself with the
paper.

The girl came up and said, "Hey mister, whatcha got under the paper?"  To
which he replied, "Nothing kid, it's just my pet bird.  Now go away."

Being curious, the girl then asked, "Can I please see your bird, mister?"

"NO," snapped the man.

Once again, she asked, "Please can't I just pet your bird?

The man replied angrily, "NO, GO THE HELL AWAY!!!"

The little girl walked away and the man fell asleep.  The next thing the
man knows, he's waking up in a hospital bed and there's a doctor standing
over him, laughing.

The man demands to know where he is and why he is there.  The doctor calls
the little girl who witnessed the whole incident to come in and explain
what had happened.>

Tearfully, the girl walks in and sits next to the man.

The man says, "Hey, you're the little brat from the beach.  What's going on 
here?"

To which the little girl replied, "I'm sorry mister.  I know you told me
not to look at or touch your bird, but after you fell asleep I did anyway."

"So, that doesn't explain why I'm here," replied the man who was getting
angrier by the minute.

"Well," the girl continued, "while I was petting it, it spit at me, so I
broke its neck, crushed its eggs, and set its nest on fire."

commercialism is good and bad.  the good is more good music will be more
easily availble  ....   bad is coca-cola raves.  you saw perry farrell's
attempt to bring _two_ would-be-raves to the pb-cle area.  i forget what
they were called, it was a lollapaloza-rave-type-thing.  anyhow it is
happening, and everyone involved is going to have to deal with it.  you
cant just pretend nothing is going to happen and the happy little scene is
going to stay happy and little.  i hope it stays happy and i hope little
parties happen, sometimes i just dont like the big 'ol megaraves.....
anyhooo.... enough on that from me.  next?

Yeah, I concur.  Double check the pb-cle FAQ to see if it mentions
"Goodtimes".  some FAQs do and if it was there, it could have saved you
some skewering!  :) Anyway, you're not nearly as bad as that jello for
brain who posted all those dumb jokes.  Stick around.

WHOEVER ORIGINATED THIS MESSAGE AND FORWARDED IT TO ALL THESE GROUPS HAS
PROBLEMS. THESE JOKES ARE VERY SEXIST AND DEGRADING TO WOMEN. THESE LISTS
ARE NOT MEANT FOR SPREADING GARBAGE. THE PERSON WHO WROTE THESE SHOULD
GROW UP AND GET RID OF THEIR DIAPERS. NOT EVERYONE HAS A SICK MIND AND
FINDS THIS TYPE OF HUMOR FUNNY. YOUR AGE OBVIOUSLY SHOWS.

also picked this up today.  I didn't think I'd like it but its too 
twisted and fun to pass up.  someone else mentioned to me "oh, yeah this 
is the one to blow up huge...." 
ummm.  the reason the album is good is the hard electronics mixed with 
the wacked disco samples.   I don't think that will go down in the US 
mainstream.   Keep looking to prodigy and orbital for mainstream 
sucesses.   Worse yet, look for rock persona instant electronic bands to 
start popping up right now.....  Then you better have prayed it really 
was Moby and Prodigy who made the mainstream.
but Daft Punk ?  With a record that starts with an invocation to chicago 
house and detroit / nyc techno innovators ?   c'mon, this is one for 
people like us to like.  Josh Wink has a better chance of blowing up huge.

10-4 over and out good buddy.

while i, like everyone else, would like the scene to 
be like it was before...it just ain't going to happen.
nothing is constant, and the fact of life is that 
everything is dead from the moment it is born.
meaning all things degrade.  this applies to music
culture as well.  hate to sound pessimistic, but i am.

pop culture has successfully popatized about every 
underground music scene that has been around, and
at the moment, "techno" is all that is out there that 
is marketable.  they will take our music, let it sell
products and clothing and crap rip-off vanilla icers
and that is the sad fact of life.

let's just hope that maybe 5 years from now, when
"techno" is no longer popular, that the scene is 
rebuilt from the ground up with the same vibe as
before.  from what i can tell now, the only way to 
stop our music from going total mainstream is to 
change our music into something that the mainstream 
wants no part of.  an example of what i mean is
the stuff done by alec empire's new digital hardcore
recordings label.  total rebelion against everything.
but that's a different story.

love,
ryu

well, in my opinion, about 80% of kids i see already have these attitudes.

this is exactly my point.  it is a *losing* battle.  it's already
commercialized, just not to the point where you see and hear it everyday.
but don't worry, that will be here soon :).

let's put it this way: i'd rather give my money to Camel and know that the
night will run smoothly without an early halt and i will get what is on the
flyer rather than risk giving my money to countless drug-dealing promoters
who do not fulfull their promises.  eventually, they will be wiped away by
these corprate large scale events because *they* will deliver and the
promoters will still not be as trustworthy.

Well, apart from that, I find it a bit excessive to post 5 of those
"chain mail-ish" type fowards at once.  I can appreciate many of the
humorous posts on here every now and then, and generally they are always
pretty funny/interesting, but I'd have to agree and say this was a little
childish.

Seriously, I'm getting sick of all the cross-posts that have been 
forwarded to every raves list in the country, letely.  I kinda wish we 
were back to a private list, like Tom tried to set up earlier this fall.  
Can we take a vote or something to see if peeps want to close off the 
list from non-subsribers?  If someone really has something they want us 
to hear, shouldn't they be an enrolled member first?  Hitting the 'D' key 
more often every day now...

Cappage aside, I agree.  When things get to a certain point, it's time to 
start anew.  Maybe from the ground up again with house parties.

The reason we're not a private list anymore is twofold: first, people
couldn't figure out how to post properly, so I would get TONS of bounced
messages.  Second, A lot of people aren't on the list but do post relevant
information to pb-cle-raves.  There is a solution, but it won't happen for
a while.  Right now Trout and I are working to get up to speed on his
taking over the list, so our time to devote to solving the crossposting
problem is nil.  However, there are some new options for list control at
Hyperreal, and when time permits, we will look into using these features.

Hold tight.

i got this tape somehow in the mail. i don't think it was supposed to
go to me. my address is apparently the return address but i never sent
this tape. it seems like it might be from somebody on here. it got
smashed up in the mail + came in one of those "please accept our
apologies" bags. the bag says pittsbugh, PA. this is what is remaining
of the address on the package:
        -._
           |rey
(torn up   |7th pl.
  area)   /mond NE, WA
---------'   98052

the tape has a "trip hop & trance" side & a "pumpin side" there's a 
long track list i don't have time to type out + i haven't played the
tape. hopefully somebody can identify it + i can get it sent out to
the right person.

well the cross-posting is nothing new, one here, one there is no big deal,
but the problem is ppl reply and dont watch or dont care about the to: and
cc: fields.  
it makes sense in that spamming is harder, but that ppl who want to post
useful info and arent subbed cant, and someone has to forward it...

what happened that tom opened the list back up?

i've just listened to about 50 ppl on another list tell me their age and
birthday!  hows that for annoying!  (AH if anyone cares to know [tom] :)

 My name is Gyrate (Gabe James) and I am looking for LIVE PA bookings
 for the year of 1997.  Recently I have been performing live in the
 Southwestern United States as well as Florida.  Currently, I have a
 promotional 12" release on DJ Huggie and Chagia's "Global Energy Musik"
 (LA).  This 1997 print is an advance copy containing my track "Electric
 Storm," and is strictly in promotion to reach distributors, magazines,
 and DJs worldwide.
 
	I would like to reach interested promoters who are willing and able to
 book my LIVE PA for their upcoming events.
 
	Please contact me at the following:

 	E-mail: <system22@cris.com>
 	*When E-mailing please subject your message as Gyrate*

 							Kind Regards,
 
 								Gabe James

Hi all. I need some help on with a project I am working on. It's my album
for Jungle Sky. What I am looking for is a female vocalist who is down
with doing vocals on a couple jazzy drum & bass tracks I've completed. No
experience is necessary, all I can ask is that she can sing. If she can
write lyrics or poetry that's an added bonus.

ALSO...I need help from anyone who has access to and knows how to operate
video editing equipment and anyone who might want to help out on a video
project for a couple tracks.

If either of these is you or you know some one than can help then please
email me back and we can work out the details. The release date for the
album/CD isn't till June or July however I may want to have one of the
tracks and the video near completion by early May. 

Thanks in advance,

joe

right on erik. i have been going to parties for over four years and when i
started out i was the exception to the young rule. i was the only young
one and all my friends were older. i don't have a problem with the young
scene either, just the attitude.
	 but i do disagree with you on one point,the promotion. i am a promoter
, i don't know if you've ever heard of the sunshine kids, but that's who 
i'm part of. please don't dis promoters,because we're just doing this for
you and all the rest of the scene. if we wern't throwing parties and
promoting then, where would your scene be? so the next time someone hands
you a flyer take it and smile knowing that they are doing it so that you
can have a good time.  :)

    I saw the 20/20 report on "raves" and I think everyone on this list, as 
    well as friends of people on this list, should complain. For those who 
    didn't see it, it was a very biased and oversensationalized report.  
    I'm not saying that drugs don't exist in the scene, but there report 
    stated  "if you don't use drugs at a rave you stick out like a sore 
    thumb" and "there is so much peer pressure to use drugs".  Please tell 
    me if I am wrong, but I really don't think this is the case.    
    Crap like this makes it really hard to get new spaces, there are people 
    who think media is God and whatever they say must be the whole truth.  
    
     You can call ABC news and ask for the 20/20 comment voicemail.  The 
    number is 212.456.1000.  I know they have a website but I don't know the 
    address.  I assume its something like www.abc.com or something to that 
    effect.  
    
    Please forward this message or the phone number to as many people as 
    possible.  We must let our collective voices be heard.

Hehe, you are going to hate this but Alec Empire does have a video on MTV
for 22:24 I saw it on AMP last night, it will re-air at 1:00am tonight. It
cam,e as quite a suprise to me since the last time I heard an Alec Empire
track was 1994 and it was a dark breakbeat track which came out around the
FIRST time dark breaks were huge. It actually inspired me. You may also
like to know that Alec is a member of the techno act Atari Teenage Riot
which has several videos on MTV (Speed and Unity) and just recently played
at Metropol. (Did any of you go?) I just want to say this whole debate
about commercial sucess (and that's what we are talking about) of techno
is a moot point. So far no techno record has gone gold (sold 500,000 or
more) in the US. I have heard from a friend of an friend who works for MTV
that this is to be the year that electronic dance music finally takes
Americ. MTV plans to push it fairly hard. Just remember to tell the
younguns what it was like in the warehouse days.

No matter what happens this year I and the rest of the Jive Turkeyz are
commited to doing renegade, outlaw shite (hehe) into the next Millenium
whether it's in the form of renegade full moon parties or pirate radio or
whatever we've got a number of ideas which we'll be working on over the
next year. We  plan to provide fun for free or extremely cheap to the
people who want it and come in the original spirit of the rave. SO while
there will likely be a Rave-a-polooza or JostaRave or whatever (and I have
NO problems with that) we will continue to adhere to our policy of FFF
(Free, Friends and Fun).

I found this on MTV's website and it seemed appropriate to what we are
discussing (ie: the new mainstream popularity of electronic music. It is
their current news feature for this week. I've edited just to the relevant
points.
joe

--------------------------Begin---------------------------
   
   But Beck is merely the popular reflection of the new underground --
   and it ain't indie rock. A brief look at this year's album charts
   confirms that America's youth has grown weary of amped-up guitar rock
   bands, and is searching for a new source of enlightenment. They're
   turning to electronic artists like Chemical
   [INLINE]
   Geto Boys - The Resurrection (Rap-A-Lot/Noo Trybe)
   Lush - Lovelife (Reprise)
   DJ Shadow - Entroducing... (Mo Wax/ffrr)
   Eels - Beautiful Freak (Dreamworks)
   Patti Griffin - Living With Ghosts (A&M)
   They Might Be Giants - Factory Showroom (Elektra)
   Elysian Fields - Bleed Your Cedar (Radioactive)
   Future Sound Of London - Dead Cities (Astralwerks)
   Butter 08 - Butter (Grand Royal)
   Yo Yo - Total Control (EastWest)
   The Raincoats - Looking In The Shadows (DGC)
   The Cardigans - First Band On The Moon (Mercury)
   Pulp - Different Class (London)
   Ani Difranco - Dilate (Righteous Babe)
   Joe Henry - Trampoline (Mammoth)
   Soul Coughing Irresistible Bliss (Slash/WB)
   Hayden - Everything I Long For (Outpost)
   Sukia - Contacto Espacial Con El Tercer Sexo (Nickelbag)
   Sebadoh - Harmacy (Sub Pop)
   Gorky's Zygotic Mynci - Gorky's Zygotic Mynci (Mercury) Brothers,
   Tricky, Goldie, Prodigy and Future Sound of London to tickle their
   rock-deadened synapses. The gamble is whether these groups can pull
   the electronic genre above-ground to compete for the industry's big
   marketing dollars. Currently, none of the new breed have sold anywhere
   near the minimum head-turner: 500,000 copies for a U.S. gold record.
   But their influence appears to be growing. MTV has added the
   late-night, one-hour electronic showcase, Amp, to their lineup, and
   are including Chemical Brothers and Prodigy in regular channel
   rotation. 
   
   Electronic music also seems to be affecting people other than your
   standard "Sprockets" technohead. In the hip-hop community, DJ Shadow
   crafted one of the most impressive albums of the year by blending rap
   beats with oppressive samples, ambient sound effects, and orchestral
   passages. Trip-hop pioneer Tricky released a bizarre, confrontational
   album that explores nearly every facet of electronic sound. On a more
   mainstream level, Everything But The Girl spread the gospel of drum
   and bass on their groundbreaking record, Walking Wounded. David Bowie
   released the breakbeat-laden "Telling Lies" over the internet, and
   will follow in early 1997 with his excellent, electro-rock disc,
   Earthling.
   
   Credit the new focus on "techno" to the complete mainstream acceptance
   of alternative rock, which has had a three-fold effect: The market is
   over-saturated with second-rate groups; nothing sounds revolutionary
   Future Sound Of London
   Future Sound Of London - Dead Cities (Astralwerks) "The overall
   sensation of Dead Cities transports one to mind-numbing, cataleptic
   euphoria -- an impressive achievement for music made with almost no
   traditional instruments." -- Lily Moayeri, 10/96 review anymore; and
   baby boomers and young parents are starting to listen to the same
   kinds of music as their kids. Even if mom and dad don't quite jive
   with Bush and No Doubt, they probably relate to rock and even punk
   enough to not consider today's alternative crop too offensive. And
   what good is music if it can't annoy your parents; any sane young
   person will be driven to the rebellion of the flipped-out, hi-tech
   sounds of electronic music.

I agree and I put my two cents in by dropping them a note on their website
but my point is since 1992 there have been these reports. If anything they
are comical in their one-sideness. The report on 20/20 was called "Stop
the Raves". Well the funny thing is every one of thse reports is giving
kids who knew nothing about the rave scene advertising we couldn't buy. 
It's no suprise that every year there has been an exponential growth of
the scene (1992, 1993, 1995 and 1996) there have also been alot of these
negative stories. If they really wanted to stop the raves they wouldn't
report on them at all. Instead kids see lasers, video projection, loud
music and drugs and go "I'm there!" It is no suprise that 1994 was a lean
year for attendence somewhat. There was little media coverage of raves
that year. My point is the media has been doing this stuff for 5 years
here in the US and 10 in the UK and the scene is still here. We are bigger
than their shallow tabloid journalism. At the rate things are going this
year will be a watershead year for our scene and so you can expect to see
even more of these reports. Take em with a grain of salt.

hidee ho kids...this is a message a wrote before to the breaks list and I
don't even know if it ever even got posted.  But it offers my thoughts on
another angle on the underground/mainstream issue. and I added some stuff
to it. The subject has been beaten to a bloody pulp, but it's still an
intoxicating subject for me.  We're talking pop kulcha here, one of my
favorite things.

Lemme know what you think if you bother to decipher where I'm coming from
in this choppy summary, the point of which is that the underground ain't
going anywhere.  Ever. Just changes content and fluctuates in shape.  Like
a wave.  That's in case you don't want to decipher my theoretical
gibberish.  ;)

Hmmm...think of it in a wider historical setting.  The underground has
always/will always be there.  This century is a gorgeous feast of
"undergrounds" from New Wavers to alternakids, to punks, to Mods, to the
early hip hop scenesters, to seXhc kids, to hippies, to beatniks, to
bobbysoxers, to flappers to those wacky homoerotica enthusiasts back in
the 20s.  

The underground has been around forever, tho.  You have the mob,
the Underground Railroad, jazz, early Christians, cults all
the way thru history including the phat crew of ladies who
worshipped/honored/chilled HARD with the poet Sappho onthe island of
Lesbos off the Greek mainland a couple thousand years ago.
you got your Bauhaus, your Warhol Factory, your Romantics, your
existentialsists, your leftists, your Argentinean political
graffitists, and on and on. And you got your ravers. There is
always a portion of the population that goes off and does its own thing
for whatever reason.  /and if it's solid enough, it catches on as more
people recognize its worth, and eventually you're reading snippets of
poems like "...you burn me..." referring to the greek sun, or maybe a
lover? in your high school reader.

Thing is, the world has never before been in the state it's in now and
since things move so fast it's interesting to see how things mutate,
bubble and spring up into the "mainstream."

But don't forget that the mainstream is fed to the masses and produced
such that it kind of contributes to the increasing polarization of, well,
everything.  As the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, the religious
fanatics get more fanatical and the rebels get more pissed off, the
underground will veer off even more defiantly.  As it veers off, it gets
more and more bewildering to the people who listen to Hootie and what
Friends.  That's ok, tho, b/c they have a plethora of shite to choose from
in the mainstream...even stuff that appears hip and on the edge.  But to
complicate things, everything is a contradiction these days so you get an
interesting, intricate relationship between the mainstream and the
underground where they feed each other, share common ground, and
intersect. 

So you end up with scenarios like this....I worked for a newspaper where
one of the music writers got his very, very on-point views published and
read by the whole metro area, (this Pgh writer highly propped the rave
scene and quoted a cop as saying that ravers were very nice and
well-behaved...they didn't even curse. :) but his beer-indie rock band
couldn't get play on college radio b/c they were too underground...sorta.
that's simplifying it, but you get it.

This weird, weird, often infuriating relationship is not only exemplified,
but epitomized by the entity like MTV.  It makes you furious to be
played, but a teeny part of you kind of likes it...and you're furious that
you like it because you're being played....etc.

My solution?  Throw your TV out the window and hope your kids don't get
left in the intellectual dust because of it.  Oh, and make more phat
tracks.

Woo hoo, aren't i academic this evening???  ;)

> Ahh fuck.. I can rip on this guy for ages.

My brother, I feel your pain.

That's the real solution because, you see, Canada IS Utopia.  Isn't this
right, Jimena?  Now if only they'd take over Cuba when Fidel passes on so
we'd have somewhere warm to say "out" and "house" with a funny lilt...

Partially in protest against all the bad and/or negative coverage out
there, I'd like to do a story on positive effects the rave scene has had
on people's lives.  I know people who have been completely turned around
because of it.  I am a good and fair writer and I want to write frankly
about this subject b/c i think it would be interesting.  I even plan to
talk about how e has been theraputic for some people, and how drug use in
other people has gone down dramatically because of raving.

if raving has made a very significant difference in your life and you'd
like to put in your (anonymous) 2 cents, please get in touch with me.  I
don't know what publication I'd put it in, I wouldn't mind a zine, but I'd
like to go for something bigger, say a city magazine or newsweekly if
they'd take it.  These stories deserve to be heard.  

BTW, If you want references, a big piece I did on the rave scene about a
year ago before i was REALLY actively participating in it is available on
the web.  write back privately for details.

I'd rather not contribute to this.  It's more polarization of the big guys
versus the little guys.  Mom and Pop stores and small promoters are in the
same boat....they can't compete with Walmart, or Bassrush as the case may
be.  this sucks because without the little guys, you loose diversity.  

But the newest wave of the underground is there.  I think you're going to
see the best of everything in small, tight, amazing house parties.  The
underground of the underground, kept tight to eliminate the biters.  And
this concept will reinvent itself as needed.  Without the help of Camel.

If you can get this published somewhere, by all means do.  i doubt it would
ever happen because its not the sensationalized version everyone wants to

        After watching the 2020 episode, a friend and i were a bit baffled
by the fact that WE know this is one sided. WE know that what was being
broadcasted was just pc tabloid journalism. But 2020 is a very respectable
program in the minds of viewers who want to perpetuate the value of their
opinions recieved from other glamourus sources of media. Its like all you
need is a reputation and some statistics to manipulate, with a little
rhetoric, and then you have a well respected, well trusted documentary
program pointing out whats wrong with what most of america _isnt_ doing to
make them feel better about being normal.
        The term for this sort of media i call "Inertia of the status quo"
and has always been apart of reacting to any evolved subculture (thats
right this aint no disco fad baby!). But, to react properly to these types
of media it would be wrong to just show the other side or show the flaws in
their assumptions. This in itself is the flipside to bad media: negatively
inspired reactions.
        If all the ravers in the world called 2020 and complained, it
perpetuates the inertia of status quo, becuz many parents including
psychologists (who might suspect their introverted children of being
influenced by loud music and other such unorthodox activities) would see
this type of negative reaction as a weakness in our ability to comprehend
THIER truth. This type of thought is everywhere in our culture; being
different and breaking the law on one occassion seems to constitute a
weakness or an addiction, and the more you complain, the more you are
thought of to be in the first stages: denial. its an uphill battle, telling
the rest of the world they are wrong.
        My point is, 2020 showed you the bad connotations to rave and dance
culture. most of america has only the seen the bad side, becuz they only
see the flipside to us; and thats their first exposure. So its their truth
about us. Obviously the parents of the kids who were ignorant enough to
abuse their bodies to a point of dehydration have somthing to say about the
negativeness involved in the activities and people who were associated with
their childs death; they could never place the blame on the deceased. they
must blame the culture, a bigger broader blame. its safe to blame raves
becua they arent perpetuating the inertia of status quo.
        I believe we must protest. But we cant do this by just reacting to
the facts. We must impose knew knowledge about ourselves. Maybe we owe
america an explanation of why we do what we do. My parents probably watched
2020 and they probably just got more terrified about what the hell im
doing...

        Thats just it....
                        i try to tell them...
ive invited them to come and see what we do and how we dance and how we
smile and how we love one another... but they dont want that..they like
being in the shallows of their own images created to listening to us talk
like ravers...(which sort of brings up another topic..my friend said that
when she met me she though i was a raver just becuz of the way i
talked..its usually the clothes or the gaze that tell people, it came to me
that we Do have our own language, not as universal as the clothes or the
dance styles, becuz they are more VISUAL)..tv is a hell of alot more
influencial to the public than radio is, and not just becuz tv waves are
broadcated farther..its becuz they are broadcasting images..

ANYWAY....we come towards a more universal level of communication..images.
They're more universal than sounds and words becuz they dont let ones
imagination fill in the missing details of a story when we are telling it,


so... stephanie i think you're on point about exposing info on the
positiveness of   many facets of our culture percieved negatively...but
keep in mind that its harder to do this with words typed in a magazine or a
newspaper... words dont change opinions and much as images do, escpecially
if your talking about the positiveness of an illegal drug. you can be who
you are on film, but you are just a name in a newspaper article.

i believe the only way to shed some positiveness to the public about our
scene is thtough a video documentary, using stastics and enough politically
correctness and sensibility, and interviews with a least on or two people
without any pierces on their body. mtv might help us out on this one..

we need something parents can understand. we need to demonstrate that we
recognize their fears, and overcome them with love, not disrespect.
personally im a bit jaded with my views on plur, but the respect thing is
something that is neccassary in learning to deal without the Unity..

        So think twice about showing america whats up with rave scene.. and
if you wanna protest, think of it as a rebellion fueled by love, and we
must protest being the IMAGES of drugged out underachieving ganster
drugdealers, but the flipside is that most of america isnt stupid for
thinking it..they have no access to the images we see at parties. dont
blame them.

        The overriding factor in any rebbelion is whether you truly
understand what youre rebelling against. In my opinion, i like being
curiously underestimated and secretive, because it gives us an upperhand on
understanding both cultures...however i think its about time that we show
america everything good about us; for one it would decrease the amount of
partykids who go becuz its so cool to do...no bad kid wants to be a part of
an intellectual gathering, if how we were portrayed was a bunch of geeks
with big clothes and synthesizers. hehe this probably wont happen but its a
nice thought in terms of keeping things tight.
        i just think america needs some love baby..enuff of this fear crap....
thats why im optimistic about things to come. pretty soon going to a rave
will be like going to a rock concert in most peoples eyes (thanks to mtv,
theres another topic>> the benefits of mtv..they arent hurting
anybody..just chill) so we will be able to party the way we want to in a
post rave environment (whatever thats going to be:) and still tell our
parents were going to a rave..and then they can watch the watered down
censored politically correct rave stuff on mtv and realize that their
children our just being part of a fad..
SO ITS ALL GOOD!!!

KEEP IT POSITIVE YO!
        peace:)

its about music and dancing right? thats right.

This very fact makes me ill.  I used to really like 20/20 and 60 minutes
because by the end of their stories I didn't know who to believe.  It was

A linguistics student at Pitt did a study on the speech of ravers.  I've
been wanting to track it down.  If I do, I'll let you know.

Good points, but here's the thing.  I'm good with words...i know nothing
about images.  :)  But some people trust print more than film.  Doesn't
move around on you, you know? ;)  Actually, a friend of mine in Pgh is
working on a documentary.  It takes a lot of people and efforts to make a
difference.  One piece I do isn't going to be THE pivotal piece in the
history of the world.  Just a contribution to the common pool of knowledge
and opinion.  If only one person had ever made an elektro record, would
there now be a style called electro? :)

Argh!  That's exactly it!  have you noticed john Stossel (sp) is a
battering ram against america's fears of late.  it's different but still
one-sided.  the funniest thing is one time when he had a special on and he
started saying things that were clearly opnion.  But just to make sure
there was no confusion, they flashed the word "COMMENTARY" under his
talking head.  Ha ha!  Harrison deBergeron and the land of the 25th

hey i haven't heard yet what anybody else thought of "the ruffest",
but i'll say a a few things about it.

the space was like out in the boondocks (north ridgeville), kind of
out of the way. my mom gave me a ride there but she was so furious
that it was farther away than the other space (does anybody know why
it got moved?) & we got in a big fight. if you saw me near the
beginning, then that's why i was kinda a wreck, although i started
feeling much better after lots of hugs =] + once the music got going
=]. my mom called me just now + she said that i misunderstood her &
she wasn't as mad at me as i thought she was so things are ok now.

the space was an indoor skatepark--really nice. when i 1st went in, 
the skaters & bmx bikers were all still there. some were bustin out 
pretty phat tricks, i saw this kid kickflip from the top of a ramp, 
over a trashcan standing up, & onto the next ramp. somebody told me he
did a 360 like than too. i really wish i could have come from my house
to this party, that way i could have brought my board & better shoes 
to skate in. not that i can do too many of those phat tricks, i can do
a few things though. i'd never been to a skatepark before, or skated
on ramps.

the music was almost all hardstep jungle =] (!) i heard just 1 set of
intelligent jungle, which was enough for me, since i don't have as
much fun dancing to it as i do dancing to hardstep/jump up. although 
it's nice to listen to while sitting & resting. as usual i don't 
remember all of the dj sets, but the ones that i particularly liked
were noel, dara, & i think tik tak (? well whoever was on last). i
don't remember who played what records either, but i heard "ready or
not here i come", "super sharp shooter", & that one that has the same
mc as super sharp shooter i think where part of it goes "every moves a
documentary" or something like that, & some others that i can't
describe. anyway all the music was very good. speaking of "ready or
not here i come" i heard 2 versions of it, the one that i think
everybody knows + this other version that was slower + had less drums
+ no mcing. i just bought this record that is 1 of those versions but
i didn't know there was more than one ready or not + didn't bother to
check it that carefully. hopefully it is the fast one with mcing +
lots of drums.

the sound there was very very good--9 out of 10. no distortion + the
levels were perfect--plently of bass + not too much treble, not at all
muddy. the only problem was it was a little too loud at times.

besides a couple of disco balls + their lights, the lighting wasn't
set up on time or something, because i saw people hooking up the 
cables about halfway thru the party. the lighting was ok, just some 
trackspotters + fog :], no lasers. :[

how many people were at this party? i'm not very good at guessing
those kind of things. maybe 400 or 500? i met a lot of new people
there. it was over at around 7:30. too bad there was no afterhrs (at
least as far as i know there wasn't), somebody told me people came
there from detroit + maybe farther + it really sucks to not have a
clean place to rest for at least couple hrs before driving that far.

anyway i had so much fun there + big props out to baseheads, all the
djs, & the sound people; hi + love to everybody i saw there!

youre right. what was i thinking? parents would be more influenced by 1
hour of 2020 and a morning newpaper article than 100 hours of mtv. i was
just assuming that pretty soon theyll be more watered down rave media more
about the culture and the music, but that will be primarily a marketing
wave, which is what mtv is i guess...
        i guess my point was that the more raves get advertised in
mainstream the more the look will not define our culture anymore..and its
already happened.. 1 out of every 3 people on this campus of mine has
baggie jeans, shotr hair, tommy H jackets, toungue piercings;
        whatever... its the look thats made us scenesters even more
_invisible_ and i love that! it happened in the beatnik generation too, i
was talking to my parents and everyone back then wore bellbottoms becuz
thats what was fashionably in, so we wont have to be suspicious anymore.

       so maybe youre right steph about language..whatever the case i think
thats our only saving grace as far as keep things lowkey. i see the future
in terms of promotion as flyers on disk and word of mouth, as long as we
are able to progress our language from a dead one to a living one....thats
means we must get into hip hop..hiphop still has a farther way to go in
acceptance among ravers, i know some people will never like it, but music
in rhyme on time to beats is a way to let your words hit deep without
trying too hard..
        i think thats where we will separate....with the languages..as long
as we have a slang that kids wont understand unless they want to...then we
can let the underground scene live on...

ignore me if you like, cuz i could have said it better.

   I can't believe ATR played here without me knowing about it, unless 
they opened for some non digital hardcore act, or were at the Banana or
something. Wow.  A punk band with hard breaks - I'd love to see that in
pgh, considering the relatively few connections between the punk and rave
scenes.   Supposedly MACE is doing some tracks with breaks in them but I
wouldn't expect too much.
	I watched AMP for the first time last night, but the ATR
wasn't on - maybe it was a 'new' episode.  Some really cool videos, like
the one of continually looping and shifting cartoons and the bouncing
acorn - can't think of the artist.  The computer graphics videos got tired
after a while though - not that I don't like them, its just I'v seen it
done a million times before.  The ones with live/action mixed media were
definately more interesting.

	Can't wait for Technique next week - see you kids there in your
jammies. :P :)

on mace's new cd, peter messes around with breaks...but nothing 
at all revolutionary...just simple loopings.
they did MUCH more electronicwise when chuck j was in the band.
[by the way, does anyone know where chuck j is now?  what he's
up to?]

here's my views on the evening:

starchild was on when we got there.  he was pretty good.  all hardstep/jump up

then came ruffian, i think. he also played a bunch of big hardstep/jump up
tracks.

next up was dara.  he was probably the most ejoyable set of the evening.
all hardstep/jump up though.  sensing a theme here?

after him was sine.  i liked sine a lot.  he finally changed the style of
the stuff that was being played a little.  a couple of darker tracks, but
then brought it back to jump up by the end.  

next was noel.  i was pretty unimpressed actually, though he did play one
*really* good track that he had double copies of.  too bad he didn't do too
much with them.  it was a really good track though.  i forgot the sample so
i can't even ask what it was.  hardstep/jump up.

after him came mike filly.  damn, his set came as a huge breath of fresh air
to me.  i loved it.  unfortunately, my feet had lost feeling several hours
ago and i was getting tired so we left in the middle of the set.  he played
really nice, smooth, melodic jungle.

i missed tik tak, who played last, but i never like him anyway :P

i'd say the attendance couldn't have been more than 350 at the *very* most.
nonetheless.  at $14 (to average the 13-15 if you had canned food or not)
that ain't too shabby.  i wouldn't think the party costed too much.  

the one thing i don't understand was this:  they set up lights at 4am.  alli
have to say is, why bother?  there was only 3 hours left anyway.  i don't
understand this at all, but oh well...

the space was nice though, but more suitable for a larger event.  it made
the place look very empty (well, it was.)

the other problem:  nearly *everyone* was just standing/sitting around not
anywhere near the sound system even!  why was this?  my guess was because of
the scarcity of narcotics that evening.  they did very thurough searches for
drugs due to the 20/20 feature.  i have no problem with this, but apparently
everyone else was complaining that there were barely any drugs there:  boo hoo.


ahh...cleveland, it just keeps getting better and better, eh?

I can tell you are a new schooler (I don't mean that as a dis either).
Most of the ravers back in the day came from the punk/hardcore scene so
a fair amount of us old schoolers were punks back in the day. DJ Deadly
Buda used to be the vocalist for Citizen Pain, I played guitar in The Hard
On Gang and Timebomb back in 89-90 and I know quite a few old school
ravers who were just as at home with going to a rave as going to a Half
Life show. I must admit I haven't kept up with that scene since '92 and I
was suprised to hear that the Electric Banana was even still standing.

Hehe, I indirectly gave them the breaks they use. Their former keyboardist
is a friend of mine and he used to come over my place and trade samples.
Around that time he started getting into drum & bass and wanted some of my
beats so I gave him a few loops I'd gathered and lo and behold there are
breaks on MACE's CD.

I forget the artist too but the track is called "Music for Babies". The
AMP you saw last night was a different one from the one which aired
friday. It used to be they just repeated Friday's AMP on Saturday night
but I guess they are getting enough videos to do two seperate episode's
a week.

I whole heartly agree.

Traveling out from Pittsburgh for this event, I wondered how things would
go off, considering the fact that 50% of the DJs were also from
Pittsburgh.  Could this be the Jungle Warfare/Rewind '97 tour (heh heh).
On the way west, Sine and I were discussing how the sets would be since
nearly every DJ on the bill was a spinner of some hard style or another. 
The questions was, since everyone else would be spinning jump-up, would it
make sense for Andy to also spin Jump-Up and Hardstep, since he had some
new tunes of that genre that he wanted to hear, or should he go for
something altogether different and spin some intelligence.  Well, I'm a
big fan of the harder styles, so I was of the opinion that if he (Sine)
was going to continue in the hardstep tracklist, it would go over pretty
well.  

I guess I was wrong about that, considering how many people were *sitting 
down* during most of the early Jump-Up sets!

All I can say is that I wish more DJs had decided to experiment with
styles like Andy eventually did, because I had no desire to hear some of
the same old hardstep of '96, especially if it was not going to hype the
crowd. (Maybe a microphone and an MC would have helped!) I usually
complain because all I hear at parties now is darkstyles ... since
Techstep is all the rage and such, but I would have prefered that at 
least one DJ of the night played something dark. 

Dara was a high point for me, 'cause at least he was playing some new 
tunes that I haven't heard before, but even his set became a little 
redundant after a while.

I just want to say that I did indeed have a great time, and all of the 
DJs were on point and very smooth on the faders, not many tricks, but all 
around good mixes.  Perhaps if the party hadn't been moved a whole extra 
hour's distance west there would have been a larger crowd, and the lights 
may have been set up on time.  I bet they were lost looking for a BP like 
the rest of us :-)  Was the original party location the first tragedy of 
20/20?  If I had known "The Ruffest" was going to be in a skate park, I 
would have brought my skate!!

All in all it was well worth the trip, the system sounded really nice, 
when the lights were finally hooked up they looked good (although I kinda 
liked the minimal disco ball that was on in the beginning :-), the DJs 
represented correctly, and I had a great time too.

                                             Tea

I used to work for Cheesy Fun Sweatshops Inc. and technophiles they're
not. I doubt Metropol/Rosebud has web or email stuff.  Try the phonebook
under CRAP and be persistent.  The employees aren't always near the phone.

sorry i missed this original message so i don't know what show you're
looking for, but the promoters themselves or the performers might have a
web site with info.

ok, i wont get into this too much...but jeff, why dont u read the reviews
of some of the camel raves that have happened thus far with their big-name
lineups and "amazing" spaces...maybe joe (187) can transcribe some of the
relevant passages from the mixmag usa article that covered the u.s. leg of
camels 'transatlantic move' party...cmon joe, tel jeff and the rest of us
what we are missing out on...;)


and as far as 'trustworthy' promoters, its like this... they are out there,
find them.


just b/c a large corporation is backing a party doenst mean it 'will run
smoothly without an early halt and i will get what is on the flyer'

i could go in any one of seventeen different directions from this point,
but if you all want to continue this discussion, reply to the list.


peace,

Thats pretty interesting...I had actually heard stories to that effect,
but didn't know the details.  Its funny how there was such a crossover
back then, but now, there's very little.  Obviously the explosion and
evolution of the rave scene is attracting a different crowd.
Maybe not co-incidentally, as the punk/hardcore connections have
diminished over the years, so has the popularity of hardcore (techno).
Doesn't really make much of a difference, but it seems in a city as
(relatively) small as pittsburgh, it would make sense for your different
scenes to co-operate (more) in terms of spaces/soundsystems/resources.

yea its the normal 15$ and it will be your traditional small to mid size 
gathering for an akron party (500 kids or so). and but of course intimit 
with a vibe ya can cut with a spork:) anyone that comes to the party on 
the mailing list come up and say hi to me please, i love meeting new 
freaks, i'll be the tall lanky cat in the middle of the dance floor 
playing on the computer(lasers) wait until you all see my new alien 
image, all right i'll give ya brief description- it starts out as a 
little dot that gets bigger and bigger that turns into a alien type 
head(not that i can remember what any of the aliens i met looked like) 
and as it gets closer you begin to notice tears Rolling from its eyes and 
its shaking its head. this is all done to the beat but of course;) 
sometimes i even through in a little quote afterwards like "what have we 
done" or somtin like dat. well enough about that come on down, over , 
across, or however it takes ya to get there cause ya know our arms will 
be open;)

okay, i got in and found out i missed starchilds set... :(  but i guess
that's okay 'cause i saw him spin at buzz last month but i still was
sad.  


anyways, i got in and dara was spinning...i don't know...i don't have
much to say about anyone's set...i spent most of my time on the line for
the bathroom.  ONE room with ONE toliet for the whole space...it took
forever because the kids were smoking up or snorting in the
bathroom...grrrr...alls i wanted to do was take a piss.  

so, i didn't really get out of the line till the dj before tic tac...was
it mike filly?  now his set i really got into that.  but it was really
weird to see all these ppl sitting around not doing anything...the most
there was 30 ppl dancing...i kinda feel selfconscience dancing when ppl
are just sitting around staring at you...but me and my friends were lean
mean baggy pants wearing dancing machines(i was the short blonde asian
girl kickin it up) 
oh and was it me or did tictac play the same set from glacial effects?
whatever...i still enjoyed it.

so who's going to technics this friday?  perhaps there should be a net
meet or something...i don't really post alot of stuff but i would like
to put a face to the names...you know?



later,
amy



p.s. by the way, this is my second party without the ravekid...the first
one was glacial effects...i miss his vibe :(
parying without adam is not the same...sigh...

Wanna bet?  DNA Information Systems (old-school BBS in Oregon) did just 
that about four years ago to celebrate the spirit of technology.  Found a 
nice, clean site (old drainage culvert), hauled in the gear, and 
sacrificed dead, unsalvagable hardware to the gods of the Matrix (Raver 
K, you hear that?).  I'd be up for helping to organise one.

Good guess, bro.  I've lost the URL for the episode's page (it's not 
referenced anywhere on the site, I just checked the thing, but I do 
happen to have the address to post "concerns" to if you've a mind to not 
run up your phone bill:

http://www.abc.com/vvoice/talk.html

Sick things..  one of the checkboxen on it is labelled "This is a rave [I

Consider it done.  It's already been posted to alt.raves, so nobody worry 
about spreading it there.  The thread for it has exceeded normal 
poster/lurker ratios.

Yeah TransAtlantic Move wasn't as great, smooth running or fun as it
should have been. I will transcribe some of the Mixmag article on it and
post it in a day or two.

  I am helping to compile a nationally oriented database of promoters.
Could anyone with information on promoters and/or labels in their area
please refer it privately to this address.  E-mail contacts would be
especially helpful.  Rave Calendars/Rave-O-Rama's could also
be helpful.  Thanks for your time and effort!

PLUR,

This is seriously not a chain letter, but something for a good cause.
Please continue reading.... you are not required to do anything.....

Just hoping you can help.  Every e-mail helps a children's
hospital help children to read.  Your support would be
appreciated.  Please forward the message.
------------------------
	the Houghton-Mifflin publishing co. is giving books to children's
hospitals.
	 how many books they give depends on how many emails they receive 
from people around the world.  for every 25 emails they receive, they 
give one book--it seems like a great way to help a good cause. all you 
have to do is email share@hmco.com. hope you can spare the seconds...and 
let your friends know.  so far they only have 3, 400 messages...last year 
they reached 23,000.

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com

This is just a reminder to log on to NBC.COM and  drop a paragraph or two
about how one sided the 20/20 segment on "raves" was!! All they talked
about was DRUGS. Not even one positive thing was said!! They even went as
far to say that no matter what you (parents) have to do, even chaining your
kid in his/her room don't let them attend these awful RAVES!!!
        They made us ALL sound like a bunch of drugged out 12 yr old zombies.
The party there cameras infiltrated was a party that I was spinning at in
New York called Perpetual Vibe. 20/20 basically got the party shut down,
and made the cops think we were all drug addicts. They turned the whole
situation around to make it look like it was a hugh manditory drug abuse
maraithon.Even a little humorus prank became a big thing. After the show
was stoped, the party go moved to a local club, outside there was a small
sign. A couple of stupid kids changed the lettering to read: exstacy and
angel dust . This was just a joke, but to 20/20 this was an official sign
that was advertising what could be bought and abused inside!!  I was there,
sure some kids were a little rocked, but not all 3000 people!! The show was
actually a really tame one!
        So please take the time to go to "abc.com" on your browser and let
Barbra, and Hugh know that there is a lot more to us and our sceen than
drugs.
Maby they can do a follow up and show that we care about our sceen, our
music, and our way of life!
peace & respects,
Stephen "Sleepy C" Cinch

Technics brand of audio equipment.  Famous for their turntables, which 
are damn near indestructable.  Their CD players, IMHO, skip a bit too 
much on Information Society material, though.  There's a 
SL1200/1210mkI/II FAQ file hanging out on hyperreal.com somewhere..

I think the person was asking about the party Technique.
It's on friday and the infoline is 412.734.5314, should be a good time for
$6-8.

not really so....  the tonearms are really flimsy, as are the rest/locks
that hold them....  to replace them means ripping apart half the table.
and the on-off switch doohickey-knob has a knack for falling apart.  other
than that, they're built like a sherman.

>There's a

ya, i dont think thats what he's looking for.  prolly the rumors that are
always floating around about ....  "technics cant get the bearings for the
motor"  blah blah blah.....  now the rumor has been changed to technics is
dumping the 1200s and marketing the cd players.  i believe its just a rumor
perpetuated by equipment dealers/resellers to keep the prices high on
them.....  why would panasonic/technics discontinue its turntables at the
same time as they release a vastly overpriced mixer that goes with the
1200???  but i digress....  there is a party named that also,  dunno
off-hand.  that reminds me, its past time for the rom.... uppp, gotta go...
 gots werk to do!  trouty.

i agree with hossam. i don't know if anyone saw the enit festival flyers,
but they sent us 20,000 to pass out, and that party ended up being
cancelled. so go ahead and trust the big names if you want to, but they
don't really care about you or your scene, just your money.

For any one that is looking for a transcript of the 20/20 story about 
raves point your browser towards
http://abc.com/primetime1/twenty/012497.html
I didn't see the show so I'm not sure if this is a complete transcript 
but it seems like they cut parts out of it.
hope this helps everyone out.

        The 1997 Net Party    hosted by NE-RAVES

	This is the second annual NE-Raves hosted net party.  The direct
purpose of this party is to unite all the members of the cybertribes through
association.  As net ravers we are a unique penomenon.  We are rapidly becoming
the next targets of cultural exploitation.  The totalitarian media industry is
trying to model the images of our scene to fit their agenda.  Unfortunately for
them, information is being distributed to the free-thinking masses by means the
dinosaur-media cannot control.  We are not what they would like us to be.  We
have the power to express ourselves.  This party is a celebration of the
technology that is changing the way the world sees itself, the way the curious
learn, the very technology you are using right now.  We bring you Yahoo.  

Tickets are available for direct purchase from the following:
(8$ presale  10$ door)

	NYC - John Speakman (speakman@hyperreal.com)
	DC/Balto - Karin Sedestrom (karins@clark.net)

	Buffalo - Sarah S.(sarahs@buffnet.net)
	Ithica - Pepper (vgun@bong.rezidew.net)
	Pittsburg - Proby (dorkie@hotmail.com)
 
Tickets are also available by mail order from me -  
Send checks or money order (m.o. preferred) written out to:
Casey Lippmeier (Caz) and send it to:

 Caz
 P.O. Box 638
 Lebanon, NH 03766

	Include a return mail address and your email addie.
	DO NOT mail any ticket requests to me after 2/10.

 	Please order your tickets and badges well in advance to help us 
fund all the extra tech-goodies we have planned for you..  ; )
 
(note: these are not normal tickets, they are laminated, individually 
numbered, flyer-style tags made with the intention of being kept 
forever.  They will serve as an "admit one" and are considered tickets in 
every way)  
Netters (sorry to the friends of netters) may also order personalized stickers
which are meant to be fastened to your ticket.  If you would like one send
email to me:  caz@coos.dartmouth.edu  and list your net name and list(s) 
you are subscribed to.

      State College, PA 10pm 8am


      ----->> BACKGROUND <<------
      to every human culture known to man, and in every stage of
socio-cultural evolution, there has most always been an artifact type
symbolizing the ability of earth to regulate itself or a sense of
equilibrium and balance. In greek mythology, Gaia was the goddess of earth
who bore and married uranus and became the mother of the Titans and the
Cyclopes. "mother earth" we commonly call her, and in many cultures we have
developed a tradition of celebration of her balance. This celebration will
be in this same spirit, and we hope you can make it!

that's the word on the streets....

dammit...i talked to one of the dj's a month ago and he swore it was in
a new location...i guess you know not to trust those spinners ;P


anyways, for 6 bucks....i'll go.  of course it'll be the same old laga
crowd there...last time i was there(HIGHLIFE) drunk kids from downstairs
came up to see what all the noise was about.  i didn't really enjoy
drunk ppl making fun of the way we danced.  hey maybe the stratus crowd
will be there too!  i'm all for new kids trying the scene out, you know,
as long it's a positive vibe...but sometimes watching those ppl grinding
to jungle and house on the stage gets a bit unbearable.



later,
amy



so what about the new meet?!?!?!?
if it is in laga, i say we meet perhaps by that little corner to the
left of the women's bathroom...whatever, i'm open to suggestions.

Until you modify the 'armlocks with a hot screwdriver and precision

you don't put it in place JUST so...

I hope not.  I use Technics CD players at WIUP, and I'm not impressed.  
They have the annoying habit of starting to skip very badly during the 
best part of "To The City.."

I apologize for having to send this twice in the space of two days, but there
were a few corrections and clarifications that needed to be made.  

	First of all the addresses I listed for Brandon Seils and Proby were
not correct.  Thier correct addresses are listed below.

	YAHOO is intended to be a party for netters and thier _friends_ so you
don't have to tell your best friend she can't come.
	
	And the last issue, the tickets.  We aren't being conventional about
the way this party is promoted (since it's a net party) so there wasn't much
need to be conventional about the way it was sold either.  Most parties
typically will give out tickets, flyers, and if you're at all lucky, id badges, 
all as seperate things.  As a cost saving measure and because we thought it was
cool, all of these things have been combined into one slick 3x6 laminated card
with the ne-raves logo on one side and YAHOO info on the other.  Call it a
ticket, or a badge, or a flyer, it doesn't matter because it's all the same
thing and you won't get into the party without one.  I've been referring to
them as tickets and the people listed below are selling them (as am I by mail). 
Now the coolest badges for a net party are personalized.. meaning they say, 
"Caz, ne-raves/v-rave" somewhere on them.  So we've put a small space for
affixing a personalized sticker on the tickets/flyers/badges.  You can order
those stickers by sending me email (caz@coos.dartmouth.edu) but please don't
request a sticker unless you've already bought or ordered a ticket

----Yahoo Update-------

	Greetings Cybertribes,

   I'm writing to update everyone on the important info for YAHOO.  First 
of all, as of this thursday (1/30).  Tickets will be available for direct 
sales from the following people:

	NYC - John Speakman (speakman@hyperreal.com)
  DC/Balto - Karin Sedestrom (karins@clark.net)
	Boston - Kris G. (keg1@cec.wustl.edu)
	Rochester - Flex (DJflex1@aol.com)
	Buffalo - Sarah S.(sarahs@buffnet.net)
	Ithica - Pepper (vgun@bong.rezidew.net)
	Pittsburg - Proby (proby@pgh.com)

And as always, tickets are available by mail order from me.
Send checks or money order (m.o. preferred) written out to:
Casey Lippmeier (Caz) and send it to:

 Caz
 P.O. Box 638
 Lebanon, NH 03766

	Please include a return mail address and your email addie.
	PLEASE do NOT mail any ticket requests to me after 2/10.


	If you want to get to YAHOO on a BUS TRIP with the netters who like to 
ride in style, contact:

 NYC - Danny Ferreira (tranced@gate.cybernex.net)
 D.C./Balto - Elizabeth Hayes (caley@UDel.edu)
 Boston - Brandon Seils (bseils@lynx.dac.neu.edu)

Lastly, there is an afterparty _and_ a preparty planned for YAHOO, more 
411 on those soon...

Look for further updates and info onthe YAHOO web page:
	bqnet.com/yahoo -or- bqnet.com/ner

		The complete email-flyer (with the line-up, hotel info, etc.)
will be posted immediately following this update....

raves point your browser towards
http://abc.com/primetime1/twenty/012497.html
I didn't see the show so I'm not sure if this is a complete transcript
but it seems like they cut parts out of it.
hope this helps everyone out.

Thank you for your note regarding the January 24th 20/20 segment on raves.

We made serious note of your comments and have shared them with Lynn Sherr

and the production staff at the program.



We regret that our presentation met with your disfavor.  Our goal is

to present news stories fairly, and although some of our viewers may

As many of you may have seen, 

I posted last week that my production crew along with another in NYC
is throwing a big event on May 25th, 1997 entitled Spring Breaks.
It will be light and sound extravaganza and will benefit one of 
several charities I am now researching.  We are aiming for an 
organization that is relative to young people, etc....

The reason for this post is that we would like to hook up on a Website 
at our party to other parties being thrown on the same night.  So 
visitors to our party can visit the booth and we can possibly have a 
live feed going on with another party in a different city.

If you know of any parties that will be thrown on May 25th please 
email me here or at : SOULFSN@aol.com with the names and #'s and/or 
email addy's of the promoters who are throwing it.

Thank you very much for your time one and all!

peace and love can still exist in the scene no matter what 20/20 says!

and then there's the occasional upheaval caused by controversial news that
there may be a better turntable than the 1200!!!  fer pete's sake, you'd
think the damn machine was god or mother theresa or something.  I have a
tt I got off the sidewalk and the drive train is so solid....none of
this belt-drive crap.  they don't
make em like they used to.  I swear this table would be a very, very
decent stand in for a 1200 for a time while I'm poor....if i hadn't
broken it while trying to adjust it to my fancy.  And radio shack even
messed up and sent me an extra replacement needle for free by accident. :(
Anyone have a knack for fixing audio equipment from the 1960s?

How this rumour got started is beyond me but Technique is not at Laga and
it is no secret where it is. It's at this place in North Park so if you
are in Oakland expecting to walk to it you better get a ride. For the
information call 412.734.5314 for directions.

Da-oh!
I think the key here is: don't trust rumors, just call the infoline.
Actually I'm mucho glad - I need a different space!

hi everyone.. 

with all the controversy lately surrounding the 20/20 report, its kind of
nice to see so many ppl take an active role in the issue + voicing their
thoughts...the web can make life alot simpler sometimees :)

anyhow, on the wnysor (toronto) list, they were talking about the 20/20
report and of course the issue of drugs came up.. one person asked:

>    To E, or not to E.
>
>    That is the question.


to which e0fdyd46@CREDIT.ERIN.UTORONTO.CA (streaker) replied:

>To B. Just B.
>
>That is the answer.

----------------------

now you all know my strong anti drug views ;)  but i still liked this one..
cynics may find it too be too glib, i thought it was succinct and
eloquent...



and then there was a letter my friend amy (donnareed on vrave) sent that i
thought was extremely well written.

i hope you enjoy it...

peace,
hossam


ps- jammin' did you ever get a reply back from abc on that prank letter?

>look, a new designer drug! Let's throw a party!".

>Raves give people who love to dance, and relax, a place to be themselves,

>evening.  
>
>Many ravers would agree that the drug use has gotten out of hand.  But

        The 1997 Net Party    hosted by NE-RAVES
 
Feb. 22
Rochester, NY
9 pm - ? am

	This is the second annual NE-Raves hosted net party.  The direct
purpose of this party is to unite all the members of the cybertribes through
association.  As net ravers we are a unique penomenon.  We are rapidly
becoming the next targets of cultural exploitation.  The totalitarian media
industry is trying to model the images of our scene to fit their agenda. 
Unfortunately for them, information is being distributed to the free-thinking
masses by means the dinosaur-media cannot control.  We are not what they
would like us to be.  We have the power to express ourselves.  This party is
a celebration of the technology that is changing the way the world sees
itself, the way the curious learn, the very technology you are using right
now.  We bring you Yahoo. 

Tickets are available for direct purchase from the following:
(8$ presale  10$ door)

They will serve as an "admit one" and are considered tickets in every way)

      State College, PA 10pm 8am


      ----->> BACKGROUND <<------
      to every human culture known to man, and in every stage of
socio-cultural evolution, there has most always been an artifact type
symbolizing the ability of earth to regulate itself or a sense of
equilibrium and balance. In greek mythology, Gaia was the goddess of earth
who bore and married uranus and became the mother of the Titans and the
Cyclopes. "mother earth" we commonly call her, and in many cultures we have
developed a tradition of celebration of her balance. This celebration will
be in this same spirit, and we hope you can make it!

I regret to say that I will not be playing at this party.  I talked to
Viktor about this already.  Unfortunately I will be on my way to
London on holiday.  Just wanted to clear that up for the public.

people,

as mentioned(?)
me an' euroboy are setting up a weekly night to 'cd-spin'
electronica at the greenhouse coffeeshop in shadyside in 
pgh.

tankx to legwork by micah/euroboy, we've gotten
permissions and the go-ahead from the place's
owner, now we just need to pick a night that's good all around.
we can have any night, except fridays (reason unknown).

I was just thinking today that there may be people
here (hopefully) that would be interested in going...and I was
also thinking that it may be bad to have it on weekends, as
it may conflict with parties and other whatnot...

...so, to that end, are there any preferences for nights for this?
we're thinking of running it in a 10-12pm timeslot, at least initially.

any opinions welcome...

*more info soon.*

I liked your response, Hossam, but here's the catch:

To E or not to E is not a question at all. Its a statement. Its a state. 

And it has no answer.

thanx to jim for the ideas.
i just perused the rave-o-matic (continuously fine work, trouty) and it
seems like little goes down in pgh on tuesday and saturday nights.

hmm...good call. well, we make a good pre-party event: you can sit and
listen to everything from minimal ambient to experimental d'n'b, then go
dance after jacking yourself up on greenhouse coffee (best in pgh, imho).

perhaps increasing to three hours, then to possible live pa's (?).

Is it being held at the back of that road near the maintence entrance 
where Crazy was held back in '95?

I agree completely--I'm drafting a letter to 20/20 
as we speak (well @ breaks between work...) and I'm 
going to modify it to send to editors of major 
newspapers if I (and others who read it) think it's 
appropriate--maybe I should send it to the sponsors 
as well (again, modified for that purpose) telling 
them that they have alienated an entire generation 
of potential buyers.

Unite and we will be strong!

Sorry for not clearing this up earlier with all the net people. 
Due to his travel arrangements Count Zero will not be performing at the
Search for Mr. YAMMA. We have therefore made arrangements with Aquafresh
and Krishna from Rochester to perform instead. 

Everything else is set as scheduled.

Its in north park, but I'd be sure and check the info line like joe sed
412-734-5314.  Since I've had an unnessicary number of posts this week,
might as well add another!

Any on a net meet, I don't know the space or the set up, but how about
near or in front of the dj table/booth before 187's set, and if its early
in the night, after his set.  I'll be wearing foam liberty spikes, and my
red nikes, so watch out.  BIG-UP whistle kru! :) haha, had to get that
out!

We cordially invite you to come and check out our site. We feel
compelled to visually document aspects of the ever evolving -- some say
mutating -- scene.  We feel that there is more to this scene than the
incessant drugCULTURE the media keeps regurgitating. Much more. We wish
to highlight some of these other facets...

Finally, we've attached a couple of shots designed to get your
attention.  Let us know what you think.

hey who's going to The First in akron on sat.? i just rechecked the
infoline, the space lined up is NICE, as in fancy-hotel-ballroom-or-
something nice, but much bigger. very clean, wood floors + carpet,
there'll probably be a bar open too. i know because this is where the 
dj kool show was at, + chris/dj buff was there with me. unfortunately,
it got shut down because of fights. i was just sitting down when the
entire 1/2 of the roomful (a big room) of people come running toward
then past me screaming, since i had never been someplace before like
that where fights broke out, i stood up + went over not knowing what
to expect, possibly a fire + instead see chairs flying thru the air + 
bottles breaking all over. chris can attest to this, he says chairs 
were thrown right past his head! =O (right chris? =V ) it was too bad
especially since dj kool was on for only 1 song, since there were like
20 mediocre opening acts with about 5 MCs each (ie. too many). :[
anyway i'm sure The First is going to go off well (!!!), i hope i'll 
see a lot of you there... =]

We cordially invite you to come and check out our site. We feel
 compelled to visually document aspects of the ever evolving -- some say
 mutating -- scene.  We feel that there is more to this scene than the
 incessant drugCULTURE the media keeps regurgitating. Much more. We wish
 to highlight some of these other facets...

We cordially invite you to come and check out our site. We feel
compelled to visually document aspects of the ever evolving -- some say
mutating -- scene.  We feel that there is more to this scene than the
incessant drugCULTURE the media keeps regurgitating. Much more. We wish
to highlight some of these other facets...

Finally, we've attached a couple of shots designed to get your
attention.  Let us know what you think.
