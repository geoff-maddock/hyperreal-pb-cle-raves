Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Subject: {pb-cle} PIT 8.9.08 -TERRY LEE BROWN JR (Plastic City Germany) @ Moto 

Terry Lee Brown Jr
Plastic City - Frankfurt, Germany
Saturday, August 9th @ Moto

Opening duties by Brother Mike (DC Space)

For years Terry Lee Brown Jr. has been considered as a member of the
international elite of House producers, and like no other, he has
developed the subgenre Tech-House. In the USA and England his first two
albums became successes of note and the media got a surprise when they
found out Mr. Brown is actually a German.

Terry Lee Brown Jr, alias Norman Feller, began DJing in 1989 and soon
thereafter released his first tracks on vinyl under various pseudonyms.
1994 was the turning point for Norman when he decided to dedicate himself
totally to music In the following year he invented the house-oriented
project (alter-ego) Terry Lee Brown Jr. which allowed him to create his
own sound. Plastic City, which was at that time still a very young label,
offered Terry an outlet for his music and he has stayed true to this label
ever since.

After the success of his first 12" releases came his debut Album Brother
For Real in spring of 1996. This release was a true milestone for
Tech-House and incorporated elements of Jungle, Trance and Easy Listening.
The public response to Brother For Real was gigantic, and not limited to
scenesters. Muzik (12/96), England's most respected dance music magazine
chose Brother For Real as one of the top ten albums of 1996 (along with
albums from artists like DJ Shadow, Fugees, Underworld and Faithless).
Marshall Jefferson, the Chicago House legend, honored Terry in an album
review by simply stating "He is God" (Raveline 11/1996).

In fall of 1997 Terry's second album Chocolate Chords garnered further
praise and matched the success of Bother For Real. In America Mixmag chose
this second effort as one of the top 5 albums of the year.

Terry Lee Brown Jr. is not only a respected producer, but also a much
sought-after DJ. This side of the artist is apparent when one listens to
the compilation series Terry's Cafe 1-5. These mixed CDs once again found
resonance in the music press and received rave reviews from Muzik, Urb,
XLR8R and other national and international magazines. But the story
doesn't end there. Remixes from TLB Jr. of such artists as Gabrielle
(Rise), Nalin & Kane (Talkin' About), Louise (Let's Go Round Again), Paul
Van Dyk (For An Angel), Paris Red (Love Hurts), and Future Funk (Music
Takes You High) secured his reputation as a true Remix-Artist.

The third and latest album From Dub Til Dawn is a product of two years
work and continues the tradition of Terry's genre-bending House-sound.
>From Dub Til Dawn brings together bass-heavy housegrooves with warm
atmospheric planes and fragmented vocals. Sound and rhythm are the most
important in this case. Fusions of House and Dub or Two-Step round out the
album. Pay attention to the track Take Your Time, which Terry produced in
cooperation with his friend and label-mate Timewriter.

Today Terry Lee Brown Junior is one of the most happening and respected
House Artists around. This is probably due to the passion and love he
invests in his uncompromising productions and mix sets. His albums and mix
CDs have shown the world that House music not only works on the
dancefloor, but also in a comfy chair.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Aug 09                      PLASTIC CITY                     Pittsburgh

Terry Lee Brown Jr., legendary house producer and DJ, is making a 
supremely rare stop in Pittsburgh to give us a special night to remind 
us why we love house music.

Humanaut is extremely proud to present:
Terry Lee Brown Jr
Plastic City - Frankfurt, Germany
Saturday, August 9th @ Moto

Tech-House and incorporated elements of Jungle, Trance and Easy 
Listening. The public response to Brother For Real was gigantic, and not 
limited to scenesters. Muzik (12/96), England's most respected dance 
music magazine chose Brother For Real as one of the top ten albums of 
1996 (along with albums from artists like DJ Shadow, Fugees, Underworld 
and Faithless). Marshall Jefferson, the Chicago House legend, honored 
Terry in an album review by simply stating "He is God" (Raveline 
11/1996).

In fall of 1997 Terry's second album Chocolate Chords garnered further 
praise and matched the success of Bother For Real. In America Mixmag 
chose this second effort as one of the top 5 albums of the year.

Terry Lee Brown Jr. is not only a respected producer, but also a much 
sought-after DJ. This side of the artist is apparent when one listens to 
the compilation series Terry's Cafe 1-5. These mixed CDs once again 
found resonance in the music press and received rave reviews from Muzik, 
Urb, XLR8R and other national and international magazines. But the story 
doesn't end there. Remixes from TLB Jr. of such artists as Gabrielle 
(Rise), Nalin & Kane (Talkin' About), Louise (Let's Go Round Again), 
Paul Van Dyk (For An Angel), Paris Red (Love Hurts), and Future Funk 
(Music Takes You High) secured his reputation as a true Remix-Artist.

The third and latest album From Dub Til Dawn is a product of two years 
work and continues the tradition of Terry's genre-bending House-sound. 
>From Dub Til Dawn brings together bass-heavy housegrooves with warm 
atmospheric planes and fragmented vocals. Sound and rhythm are the most 
important in this case. Fusions of House and Dub or Two-Step round out 
the album. Pay attention to the track Take Your Time, which Terry 
produced in cooperation with his friend and label-mate Timewriter.

Today Terry Lee Brown Junior is one of the most happening and respected 
House Artists around. This is probably due to the passion and love he 
invests in his uncompromising productions and mix sets. His albums and 
mix CDs have shown the world that House music not only works on the 
dancefloor, but also in a comfy chair.

Opening duties by: Pittsburgh house music icon : Brother Mike (DC Space)

Sat Aug 23                          PHEEK                         Cleveland

Pheek (Achipel, Montreal)
http://www.discogs.com/artist/Pheek
http://pheek.com
JP became interested in acid house in the late .80s and raves in early 
.90s, inspiring him to DJ his own radio shows in Sherbrooke, Québec. 
>From his college years to university, he played techno, house and 
anything exciting to people whose ears weren.t as close to the ground.

Upon moving to Montreal in 1997 to study computer science, JP met Mateo 
Murphy and found they shared similar musical interests. After performing 
a show with Gez Varley, Mateo and JP decided to work on a live concept 
of their own, based on improvising beats on the fly and mixing in other 
synthesized sonic textures.

It was at this point that JP adopted the name of Pheek after a Richie 
Hawtin/Plastikman performance at Medialounge, a show that would forever 
change his perspective on music.

After further honing their live show together, Pheek and Mateo opened 
for Chain Reaction at the FCMM in 1999. They were spotted by Hautec and 
offered to release a 12", marking a turning point in their fledgling 
careers.

The few years that followed saw proposed releases on Hybrid Structure 
and collaborations with Mitchell Akiyama on various projects . a 
creative period that proved a catalyst for JP.s later success.

The next pivotal point in Pheek.s career was meeting Éloi Brunelle and 
subsequently being invited to join to the Epsilonlab media collective. 
JP played with them since the very first night of their existence and 
for almost every show to follow. His first release for Epsilonlab, 
2002.s Paysages Matriciels, was a critical success and was nominated for 
Quebec.s prestigious ADISQ music awards.

Another milestone was the label Minus who noticed Pheek's demo and 
Richie Hawtin who started playing his music along with Magda. That kind 
of feedback from major DJ made him move forward in his production. Then 
he got in contact with labels such as Contexterrior and Telegraph with 
who he released some material.


Tleilaxu (Unfoundsound, Philly)
http://www.discogs.com/artist/Tleilaxu
Christopher frank (a.k.a. dj crasta) was among the first djs in 
Philadelphia to play and promote experimental music and idm in clubs, 
bars and warehouses. as the founder of springlab productions, he hosted 
events that started off as raves, and quickly evolved into something 
laid-back and sophisticated. in the late '90s, he hosted Philly's 
longest running trip-hop weekly event (called grass) at silk city along 
with Julian s. process and brad 'milkweed' Davis. as a dj as well as a 
live artist (a.k.a. Tleilaxu), he's opened for funkstorung, amon tobin, 
mix master morris, talvin singh, low, high llamas, morcheeba and others. 
inspired by labels like warp and skam when these labels were fresh and 
new, he was producing heady, broken beat-ish idm. after releasing 
compilation tracks on labels like darla, tbtmo and cloudwatch, tleilaxu 
released his debut album, gene therapy, on sean o'neal's fuzzy box label 
in 2000. musically, he has been on hiatus for the past several years to 
focus on opening and running his new café--chapterhouse--located less 
than one block away from south street in philadelphia.

Stehny (de'fchild, NYC)
http://www.myspace.com/djstefny
Stefny's true love has always been music. A musician since age 7, the 
native Californian discovered her passion for electronic music in the 
early ninties, and was influenced by early acid house, techno. Now 
taking her passion and expanding into writing/producing, she has been 
developing a sexy, deep, micro- house sound. Now Brooklyn-based 
DJ/producer Stefny Winter, has spent the last 3 years dedicated to the 
studio working towards developing her own sound. "I hear the rhythms and 
melodies of everyday life and try to translate them into my production. 
Taking it to an intensity of deep, dark, melodic, pounding, driving 
bass, however I interpret a feeling at that given moment." Her debut 
single was released in October of 2007 on Dietrich Schoenemann's Addon 
imprint and was charted in Resident Advisor by Ryan Elliot of the 
esteemed Spectral label. In March of 2008 she contributed two tracks to 
the DJ tools compilation Assignment 3, on Pheek's Archipel label. 
Forthcoming is a remix of Aschka on San Francisco label Defchild 
Recordings. She has also done remixes for DJ Ulysses' Sodium label and 
Darko's Lucy Lee Quality Recordings from Belgium. Website:

Half Adder (Tek-Know? Canton)
Celabrating his new release on Tek-Know?!
Half Adder aka Jason henry, is a dj and producer of electronic music 
from canton, Ohio. his primary musical interest lies in the area of 
avant-garde techno and house music but extends to many areas of left 
field electronic artists including broadcast, tujiko noriko and 
stereolab. his non-electronic artists of influence include the 
vaselines, minor threat and miles davis. the music of half adder 
consists of 4/4, rhythm oriented, dance floor tracks constructed from 
field recordings, sounds generated by vintage computer and video game 
equipment and samples taken from his vinyl collection. many of his 
strange, quirky and uncomfortable sounds come from home grown commodore 
64 BASIC patches that he has developed. in an attempt to incorporate his 
love for djing into production Jason builds much of his sample 
collection from hour long sessions of vinyl manipulation and mixing 
incorporating contemporary edm locked groove records, obscure disco and 
mainstream American pop music. Jason currently co-runs the experimedia 
netlabel with label founder Jeremy bible. their relationship through 
experimedia has spawned the databasis basics project which fuses jason's 
techno influence with jeremy's electro influence to create acts of 
musical weirdness with a questionable dance floor status. Jason has also 
been involved in promoting several events with cleveland, Ohio promotion 
crew Tek-know?.

Thu Aug 28                    INFECTED MUSHROOM                   Cleveland

[i love it! a "LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE"]

LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE!!!
Date: 8/28/08
Time: Doors open at 9pm sharp
Venue: Metropolis 2325 Elm St Cleveland OH. 44113
Ages: 18 to enter, 21 to drink
Cost: $25 Advance (Limited Number Available)
http://www.wantickets.com?e_id=43273
$30 before 10pm @ door; $35 there after


Israel-bred, LA-based psy-trance duo INFECTED MUSHROOM--Amit .Duvdev. 
Duvedevani and Erez Eisen--have been playing to increasingly massive, 
frenzied crowds all over the globe (over 135 shows in 2007 alone), 
thanks to an explosive live show that.s far cry from the staid 
stereotype of dance acts hunched over their laptops and turntables. This 
year Infected Mushroom.s big plans encompass numerous tour dates 
throughout the U.S. and major studio time working on their seventh 
album, due out this summer.

Infected Mushroom will kick off their 2008 tour dates March 13 in 
Austin, TX during SXSW. Joining Duvdev (vocals) and Erez (keyboards) are 
tour guitarist Tommy Cunningham and Brazilian drummer Rogerio Jardim. 
Here the industry will be able to check out a live performance of 
material from Infected Mushroom.s upcoming album and experience 
first-hand why such major festivals as Coachella, Vegoose, Miami.s Ultra 
Music Festival, San Diego Street Scene, L.A..s Monster Massive, Virgin 
Festival in Baltimore, Camp Bisco and Sao Paulo.s Tribe have highlighted 
them on their stages. Other markets Infected Mushroom is confirmed to 
perform in this year include Houston, Dallas, Boulder, Miami, Denver and 
Los Angeles.

2007 was a landmark year for one of electronica.s biggest bands. Besides 
all the aforementioned festival dates plus a headlining slot for over 
500,000 people (last New Years Eve in Rio De Janeiro, with the Black 
Eyed Peas and John Legend), they now rank #9 Overall and the #1 
Psy-Trance Artist Worldwide on DJ Magazine.s prestigious Top 100 DJ 
Poll. The band have moved to Los Angeles to get serious in the studio 
and began working on the follow-up to their album Vicious Delicious.

As told to Allan McGrath of DJ:

.In the last year we.ve come out of the psy-trance bracket, which is 
where we want to go,. Duvdev explains. .We.ve been playing rock venues, 
which we.re happy about as we never wanted to be categorized.. .We.re 
happy that people come and see Infected Mushroom even if they aren.t 
into psy-trance,. adds Erez. .We.re always looking to things we haven.t 
tried before.. Fans of their classic psy-trance pulse need not be too 
concerned though. Already, two of the tracks laid down for their next LP 
are ferocious psy-trancers . with recent tracks .Sayid. and .Nine 
Percent. instigating a full-on reception in their recent live shows. 
.There.s another track called .Black Shwarma. which blends cool lyrics 
with distorted heavy metal guitars,. adds Duvdev..

Sat Sep 20                 STEPPING INTO DARKNESS                Cincinnati

Royal Dubs Presents:
Stepping Into Darkness
September 20, 2008

Cyrus from Random Trio . Dubstep . London, UK - RTP, Tectonic
http://www.myspace.com/randomtrio, randomtrioproductions.com

One of the early pioneering DJ/producers of the sound we now call 
Dubstep, Cyrus from Random Trio 1st began his dj career back in 1998 as 
a ukg Dj. After just 3 months of mixing Cyrus was given his 1st chance 
to play for a local promotion in Croydon, shortly after he was offered a 
residency and never looked back. Various pirate radio shows followed 
along with more bookings for local clubs in & around London. The summer 
of 99 saw Cyrus take his dj'ing to the island of Corfu (Kavos). In this 
time Cyrus had met and became good friends with fellow Random Trio 
member Omni, and by 2000 were doing most of their dj sets together. They 
1st formed a little crew in 2001 consisting of themselves & 3 mc's and 
soon gained a good following. They built their 1st track by the end of 
the year and had heard interest from a major label. However before this 
took place they split going there own separate ways. Cyrus and Omni 
carried on dj'ing together and decided to carry on making beats for 
their radio shows. It was around this time they 1st heard Horsepower 
Productions and were taken aback by their unique style. They found the 
sound they were looking for. By 2003 Cyrus had made a batch of tunes and 
brought out his 1st release on their imprint RTP. This was the Lost City 
EP. January 2004 saw Cyrus with his own show on London's biggest pirate 
Rinse.fm.. One of the early nights was a night put on by DMZ called dub 
sessions held on a Sunday at black sheep bar in Croydon. With a newer 
member, Omen, Random trio have a number of successful releases and more 
recently Cyrus's From the Shadows LP. Random trio have played at clubs 
all over the world from Finland to California and look forward to the 
future.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

**A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Aug 23                          PHEEK                         Cleveland

Pheek (Achipel, Montreal)
http://www.discogs.com/artist/Pheek
http://pheek.com
JP became interested in acid house in the late .80s and raves in early 
.90s, inspiring him to DJ his own radio shows in Sherbrooke, Québec. 
>From his college years to university, he played techno, house and 
anything exciting to people whose ears weren.t as close to the ground.

Upon moving to Montreal in 1997 to study computer science, JP met Mateo 
Murphy and found they shared similar musical interests. After performing 
a show with Gez Varley, Mateo and JP decided to work on a live concept 
of their own, based on improvising beats on the fly and mixing in other 
synthesized sonic textures.

It was at this point that JP adopted the name of Pheek after a Richie 
Hawtin/Plastikman performance at Medialounge, a show that would forever 
change his perspective on music.

After further honing their live show together, Pheek and Mateo opened 
for Chain Reaction at the FCMM in 1999. They were spotted by Hautec and 
offered to release a 12", marking a turning point in their fledgling 
careers.

The few years that followed saw proposed releases on Hybrid Structure 
and collaborations with Mitchell Akiyama on various projects . a 
creative period that proved a catalyst for JP.s later success.

The next pivotal point in Pheek.s career was meeting Éloi Brunelle and 
subsequently being invited to join to the Epsilonlab media collective. 
JP played with them since the very first night of their existence and 
for almost every show to follow. His first release for Epsilonlab, 
2002.s Paysages Matriciels, was a critical success and was nominated for 
Quebec.s prestigious ADISQ music awards.

Another milestone was the label Minus who noticed Pheek's demo and 
Richie Hawtin who started playing his music along with Magda. That kind 
of feedback from major DJ made him move forward in his production. Then 
he got in contact with labels such as Contexterrior and Telegraph with 
who he released some material.


Tleilaxu (Unfoundsound, Philly)
http://www.discogs.com/artist/Tleilaxu
Christopher frank (a.k.a. dj crasta) was among the first djs in 
Philadelphia to play and promote experimental music and idm in clubs, 
bars and warehouses. as the founder of springlab productions, he hosted 
events that started off as raves, and quickly evolved into something 
laid-back and sophisticated. in the late '90s, he hosted Philly's 
longest running trip-hop weekly event (called grass) at silk city along 
with Julian s. process and brad 'milkweed' Davis. as a dj as well as a 
live artist (a.k.a. Tleilaxu), he's opened for funkstorung, amon tobin, 
mix master morris, talvin singh, low, high llamas, morcheeba and others. 
inspired by labels like warp and skam when these labels were fresh and 
new, he was producing heady, broken beat-ish idm. after releasing 
compilation tracks on labels like darla, tbtmo and cloudwatch, tleilaxu 
released his debut album, gene therapy, on sean o'neal's fuzzy box label 
in 2000. musically, he has been on hiatus for the past several years to 
focus on opening and running his new café--chapterhouse--located less 
than one block away from south street in philadelphia.

Stehny (de'fchild, NYC)
http://www.myspace.com/djstefny
Stefny's true love has always been music. A musician since age 7, the 
native Californian discovered her passion for electronic music in the 
early ninties, and was influenced by early acid house, techno. Now 
taking her passion and expanding into writing/producing, she has been 
developing a sexy, deep, micro- house sound. Now Brooklyn-based 
DJ/producer Stefny Winter, has spent the last 3 years dedicated to the 
studio working towards developing her own sound. "I hear the rhythms and 
melodies of everyday life and try to translate them into my production. 
Taking it to an intensity of deep, dark, melodic, pounding, driving 
bass, however I interpret a feeling at that given moment." Her debut 
single was released in October of 2007 on Dietrich Schoenemann's Addon 
imprint and was charted in Resident Advisor by Ryan Elliot of the 
esteemed Spectral label. In March of 2008 she contributed two tracks to 
the DJ tools compilation Assignment 3, on Pheek's Archipel label. 
Forthcoming is a remix of Aschka on San Francisco label Defchild 
Recordings. She has also done remixes for DJ Ulysses' Sodium label and 
Darko's Lucy Lee Quality Recordings from Belgium. Website:

Half Adder (Tek-Know? Canton)
Celabrating his new release on Tek-Know?!
Half Adder aka Jason henry, is a dj and producer of electronic music 
from canton, Ohio. his primary musical interest lies in the area of 
avant-garde techno and house music but extends to many areas of left 
field electronic artists including broadcast, tujiko noriko and 
stereolab. his non-electronic artists of influence include the 
vaselines, minor threat and miles davis. the music of half adder 
consists of 4/4, rhythm oriented, dance floor tracks constructed from 
field recordings, sounds generated by vintage computer and video game 
equipment and samples taken from his vinyl collection. many of his 
strange, quirky and uncomfortable sounds come from home grown commodore 
64 BASIC patches that he has developed. in an attempt to incorporate his 
love for djing into production Jason builds much of his sample 
collection from hour long sessions of vinyl manipulation and mixing 
incorporating contemporary edm locked groove records, obscure disco and 
mainstream American pop music. Jason currently co-runs the experimedia 
netlabel with label founder Jeremy bible. their relationship through 
experimedia has spawned the databasis basics project which fuses jason's 
techno influence with jeremy's electro influence to create acts of 
musical weirdness with a questionable dance floor status. Jason has also 
been involved in promoting several events with cleveland, Ohio promotion 
crew Tek-know?.

Thu Aug 28                    INFECTED MUSHROOM                   Cleveland

[i love it! a "LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE"]

LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE!!!
Date: 8/28/08
Time: Doors open at 9pm sharp
Venue: Metropolis 2325 Elm St Cleveland OH. 44113
Ages: 18 to enter, 21 to drink
Cost: $25 Advance (Limited Number Available)
http://www.wantickets.com?e_id=43273
$30 before 10pm @ door; $35 there after


Israel-bred, LA-based psy-trance duo INFECTED MUSHROOM--Amit .Duvdev. 
Duvedevani and Erez Eisen--have been playing to increasingly massive, 
frenzied crowds all over the globe (over 135 shows in 2007 alone), 
thanks to an explosive live show that.s far cry from the staid 
stereotype of dance acts hunched over their laptops and turntables. This 
year Infected Mushroom.s big plans encompass numerous tour dates 
throughout the U.S. and major studio time working on their seventh 
album, due out this summer.

Infected Mushroom will kick off their 2008 tour dates March 13 in 
Austin, TX during SXSW. Joining Duvdev (vocals) and Erez (keyboards) are 
tour guitarist Tommy Cunningham and Brazilian drummer Rogerio Jardim. 
Here the industry will be able to check out a live performance of 
material from Infected Mushroom.s upcoming album and experience 
first-hand why such major festivals as Coachella, Vegoose, Miami.s Ultra 
Music Festival, San Diego Street Scene, L.A..s Monster Massive, Virgin 
Festival in Baltimore, Camp Bisco and Sao Paulo.s Tribe have highlighted 
them on their stages. Other markets Infected Mushroom is confirmed to 
perform in this year include Houston, Dallas, Boulder, Miami, Denver and 
Los Angeles.

2007 was a landmark year for one of electronica.s biggest bands. Besides 
all the aforementioned festival dates plus a headlining slot for over 
500,000 people (last New Years Eve in Rio De Janeiro, with the Black 
Eyed Peas and John Legend), they now rank #9 Overall and the #1 
Psy-Trance Artist Worldwide on DJ Magazine.s prestigious Top 100 DJ 
Poll. The band have moved to Los Angeles to get serious in the studio 
and began working on the follow-up to their album Vicious Delicious.

As told to Allan McGrath of DJ:

.In the last year we.ve come out of the psy-trance bracket, which is 
where we want to go,. Duvdev explains. .We.ve been playing rock venues, 
which we.re happy about as we never wanted to be categorized.. .We.re 
happy that people come and see Infected Mushroom even if they aren.t 
into psy-trance,. adds Erez. .We.re always looking to things we haven.t 
tried before.. Fans of their classic psy-trance pulse need not be too 
concerned though. Already, two of the tracks laid down for their next LP 
are ferocious psy-trancers . with recent tracks .Sayid. and .Nine 
Percent. instigating a full-on reception in their recent live shows. 
.There.s another track called .Black Shwarma. which blends cool lyrics 
with distorted heavy metal guitars,. adds Duvdev..

Sat Sep 20                 STEPPING INTO DARKNESS                Cincinnati

Royal Dubs Presents:
Stepping Into Darkness
September 20, 2008

Cyrus from Random Trio . Dubstep . London, UK - RTP, Tectonic
http://www.myspace.com/randomtrio, randomtrioproductions.com

One of the early pioneering DJ/producers of the sound we now call 
Dubstep, Cyrus from Random Trio 1st began his dj career back in 1998 as 
a ukg Dj. After just 3 months of mixing Cyrus was given his 1st chance 
to play for a local promotion in Croydon, shortly after he was offered a 
residency and never looked back. Various pirate radio shows followed 
along with more bookings for local clubs in & around London. The summer 
of 99 saw Cyrus take his dj'ing to the island of Corfu (Kavos). In this 
time Cyrus had met and became good friends with fellow Random Trio 
member Omni, and by 2000 were doing most of their dj sets together. They 
1st formed a little crew in 2001 consisting of themselves & 3 mc's and 
soon gained a good following. They built their 1st track by the end of 
the year and had heard interest from a major label. However before this 
took place they split going there own separate ways. Cyrus and Omni 
carried on dj'ing together and decided to carry on making beats for 
their radio shows. It was around this time they 1st heard Horsepower 
Productions and were taken aback by their unique style. They found the 
sound they were looking for. By 2003 Cyrus had made a batch of tunes and 
brought out his 1st release on their imprint RTP. This was the Lost City 
EP. January 2004 saw Cyrus with his own show on London's biggest pirate 
Rinse.fm.. One of the early nights was a night put on by DMZ called dub 
sessions held on a Sunday at black sheep bar in Croydon. With a newer 
member, Omen, Random trio have a number of successful releases and more 
recently Cyrus's From the Shadows LP. Random trio have played at clubs 
all over the world from Finland to California and look forward to the 
future.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

**A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Aug 23                          PHEEK                         Cleveland

Pheek (Achipel, Montreal)
http://www.discogs.com/artist/Pheek
http://pheek.com
JP became interested in acid house in the late .80s and raves in early 
.90s, inspiring him to DJ his own radio shows in Sherbrooke, Québec. 
>From his college years to university, he played techno, house and 
anything exciting to people whose ears weren.t as close to the ground.

Upon moving to Montreal in 1997 to study computer science, JP met Mateo 
Murphy and found they shared similar musical interests. After performing 
a show with Gez Varley, Mateo and JP decided to work on a live concept 
of their own, based on improvising beats on the fly and mixing in other 
synthesized sonic textures.

It was at this point that JP adopted the name of Pheek after a Richie 
Hawtin/Plastikman performance at Medialounge, a show that would forever 
change his perspective on music.

After further honing their live show together, Pheek and Mateo opened 
for Chain Reaction at the FCMM in 1999. They were spotted by Hautec and 
offered to release a 12", marking a turning point in their fledgling 
careers.

The few years that followed saw proposed releases on Hybrid Structure 
and collaborations with Mitchell Akiyama on various projects . a 
creative period that proved a catalyst for JP.s later success.

The next pivotal point in Pheek.s career was meeting Éloi Brunelle and 
subsequently being invited to join to the Epsilonlab media collective. 
JP played with them since the very first night of their existence and 
for almost every show to follow. His first release for Epsilonlab, 
2002.s Paysages Matriciels, was a critical success and was nominated for 
Quebec.s prestigious ADISQ music awards.

Another milestone was the label Minus who noticed Pheek's demo and 
Richie Hawtin who started playing his music along with Magda. That kind 
of feedback from major DJ made him move forward in his production. Then 
he got in contact with labels such as Contexterrior and Telegraph with 
who he released some material.


Tleilaxu (Unfoundsound, Philly)
http://www.discogs.com/artist/Tleilaxu
Christopher frank (a.k.a. dj crasta) was among the first djs in 
Philadelphia to play and promote experimental music and idm in clubs, 
bars and warehouses. as the founder of springlab productions, he hosted 
events that started off as raves, and quickly evolved into something 
laid-back and sophisticated. in the late '90s, he hosted Philly's 
longest running trip-hop weekly event (called grass) at silk city along 
with Julian s. process and brad 'milkweed' Davis. as a dj as well as a 
live artist (a.k.a. Tleilaxu), he's opened for funkstorung, amon tobin, 
mix master morris, talvin singh, low, high llamas, morcheeba and others. 
inspired by labels like warp and skam when these labels were fresh and 
new, he was producing heady, broken beat-ish idm. after releasing 
compilation tracks on labels like darla, tbtmo and cloudwatch, tleilaxu 
released his debut album, gene therapy, on sean o'neal's fuzzy box label 
in 2000. musically, he has been on hiatus for the past several years to 
focus on opening and running his new café--chapterhouse--located less 
than one block away from south street in philadelphia.

Stehny (de'fchild, NYC)
http://www.myspace.com/djstefny
Stefny's true love has always been music. A musician since age 7, the 
native Californian discovered her passion for electronic music in the 
early ninties, and was influenced by early acid house, techno. Now 
taking her passion and expanding into writing/producing, she has been 
developing a sexy, deep, micro- house sound. Now Brooklyn-based 
DJ/producer Stefny Winter, has spent the last 3 years dedicated to the 
studio working towards developing her own sound. "I hear the rhythms and 
melodies of everyday life and try to translate them into my production. 
Taking it to an intensity of deep, dark, melodic, pounding, driving 
bass, however I interpret a feeling at that given moment." Her debut 
single was released in October of 2007 on Dietrich Schoenemann's Addon 
imprint and was charted in Resident Advisor by Ryan Elliot of the 
esteemed Spectral label. In March of 2008 she contributed two tracks to 
the DJ tools compilation Assignment 3, on Pheek's Archipel label. 
Forthcoming is a remix of Aschka on San Francisco label Defchild 
Recordings. She has also done remixes for DJ Ulysses' Sodium label and 
Darko's Lucy Lee Quality Recordings from Belgium. Website:

Half Adder (Tek-Know? Canton)
Celabrating his new release on Tek-Know?!
Half Adder aka Jason henry, is a dj and producer of electronic music 
from canton, Ohio. his primary musical interest lies in the area of 
avant-garde techno and house music but extends to many areas of left 
field electronic artists including broadcast, tujiko noriko and 
stereolab. his non-electronic artists of influence include the 
vaselines, minor threat and miles davis. the music of half adder 
consists of 4/4, rhythm oriented, dance floor tracks constructed from 
field recordings, sounds generated by vintage computer and video game 
equipment and samples taken from his vinyl collection. many of his 
strange, quirky and uncomfortable sounds come from home grown commodore 
64 BASIC patches that he has developed. in an attempt to incorporate his 
love for djing into production Jason builds much of his sample 
collection from hour long sessions of vinyl manipulation and mixing 
incorporating contemporary edm locked groove records, obscure disco and 
mainstream American pop music. Jason currently co-runs the experimedia 
netlabel with label founder Jeremy bible. their relationship through 
experimedia has spawned the databasis basics project which fuses jason's 
techno influence with jeremy's electro influence to create acts of 
musical weirdness with a questionable dance floor status. Jason has also 
been involved in promoting several events with cleveland, Ohio promotion 
crew Tek-know?.

Thu Aug 28                    INFECTED MUSHROOM                   Cleveland

[i love it! a "LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE"]

LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE!!!
Date: 8/28/08
Time: Doors open at 9pm sharp
Venue: Metropolis 2325 Elm St Cleveland OH. 44113
Ages: 18 to enter, 21 to drink
Cost: $25 Advance (Limited Number Available)
http://www.wantickets.com?e_id=43273
$30 before 10pm @ door; $35 there after


Israel-bred, LA-based psy-trance duo INFECTED MUSHROOM--Amit .Duvdev. 
Duvedevani and Erez Eisen--have been playing to increasingly massive, 
frenzied crowds all over the globe (over 135 shows in 2007 alone), 
thanks to an explosive live show that.s far cry from the staid 
stereotype of dance acts hunched over their laptops and turntables. This 
year Infected Mushroom.s big plans encompass numerous tour dates 
throughout the U.S. and major studio time working on their seventh 
album, due out this summer.

Infected Mushroom will kick off their 2008 tour dates March 13 in 
Austin, TX during SXSW. Joining Duvdev (vocals) and Erez (keyboards) are 
tour guitarist Tommy Cunningham and Brazilian drummer Rogerio Jardim. 
Here the industry will be able to check out a live performance of 
material from Infected Mushroom.s upcoming album and experience 
first-hand why such major festivals as Coachella, Vegoose, Miami.s Ultra 
Music Festival, San Diego Street Scene, L.A..s Monster Massive, Virgin 
Festival in Baltimore, Camp Bisco and Sao Paulo.s Tribe have highlighted 
them on their stages. Other markets Infected Mushroom is confirmed to 
perform in this year include Houston, Dallas, Boulder, Miami, Denver and 
Los Angeles.

2007 was a landmark year for one of electronica.s biggest bands. Besides 
all the aforementioned festival dates plus a headlining slot for over 
500,000 people (last New Years Eve in Rio De Janeiro, with the Black 
Eyed Peas and John Legend), they now rank #9 Overall and the #1 
Psy-Trance Artist Worldwide on DJ Magazine.s prestigious Top 100 DJ 
Poll. The band have moved to Los Angeles to get serious in the studio 
and began working on the follow-up to their album Vicious Delicious.

As told to Allan McGrath of DJ:

.In the last year we.ve come out of the psy-trance bracket, which is 
where we want to go,. Duvdev explains. .We.ve been playing rock venues, 
which we.re happy about as we never wanted to be categorized.. .We.re 
happy that people come and see Infected Mushroom even if they aren.t 
into psy-trance,. adds Erez. .We.re always looking to things we haven.t 
tried before.. Fans of their classic psy-trance pulse need not be too 
concerned though. Already, two of the tracks laid down for their next LP 
are ferocious psy-trancers . with recent tracks .Sayid. and .Nine 
Percent. instigating a full-on reception in their recent live shows. 
.There.s another track called .Black Shwarma. which blends cool lyrics 
with distorted heavy metal guitars,. adds Duvdev..

Music Matters 2 Stage

Lea Luna Englewood, CO
East Music/Tascam/Skull Candy

Electro-house goddess DJ Lea Luna has been on the up-and-up since 1999, 
rocking many a crowd from underground to commercial, across the US and 
abroad. Her white-hot enthusiasm on stage and in the studio reflects her 
9 year career, which has been gaining exponential momentum since she 
first stepped up to the decks as a tiny teen. "I'm taking my music 
further this year than I ever thought I would have when I first started 
spinning records. Its unreal how many different avenues there are inside 
electronic music: how many subcultures, how many diversely beautiful 
artists, fans and enthusiasts there are. After having the privilege of 
exploring this world and the music in it, I've become a pioneer. I'm 
writing, collecting, and spinning styles that don't even have names to 
them yet. This is truly a divine epiphany, and it's redirecting my 
course in life as a professional musician." She has had numerous 
solely-featured event ads, interviews, and blurbs hailing her appearance 
in dozens of US cities, as well as magazine, billboard, tour guide, and 
television representation overseas. Her broadcasts include internet 
radio Teklab. fm racking up millions of listeners worldwide, 
Clearchannel's Denver-based 93.3 FM, KGNU Boulder, and a past history of 
college radio at UCLA and Metro State University in Denver. "Love and 
music are the only universal languages, and I speak them both so 
fluently and intermittently."-Lea Luna

Eric D
Eric began playing around at his friends' houses on their turntables in 
1993. He started playing out in 1994, and quickly got into promoting 
when he threw his first night at a venue in Pittsburgh, circa 1996. 
Having been a major part of the underground movement, he was involved in 
throwing the "Renegade" parties under the West End Bridge by the river. 
He was 1/2 of N'Sync Productions, having thrown one of Pittsburgh's most 
monumental events, "Journey To Delphi" back in 1996. By 1997, along with 
others, he formed the 412 Collective, which continued to throw 
consistently good events.
Moving to Columbus, Ohio in 1998, he was responsible for the "Kikit" 
parties, as well as "Escalate" Tuesdays and "In Motion" Wednesdays, 
showcasing the best and up and coming local and regional talent. If you 
were in the scene back in the mid to late nineties to the turn of the 
new millenium, you probably heard Eric's unique style at events like The 
Family Affair festivals, Transformations 1 and 3, Revolutions 1 and 2, 
and many other one off events during that time. Last year he made his 
return, playing in Ohio at Family Affair 6 once again, for the first 
time since 2001. Once again, we're proud to bring you the sound of the 
dj... Eric D.
Since the start of his dj career in 1994, he has been rocking many 
dancefloors from Washington, D.C. to Kansas City, and everywhere in 
between. Coming to us from his residency at Vue Ultralounge in Georgia 
he's ready to bring it to the 216 once again. His style has gone through 
many changes with the times, but one thing remains constant - The 
relentless flow of energy throughout his sets. Consistently bringing 
blends of many different genres, knowing what you're going to hear next 
is almost impossible. His signature style of smooth, flawless mixing is 
not to be missed; you're definitely going to want to be on the floor for 
this one.

Sat Sep 20                 STEPPING INTO DARKNESS                Cincinnati

Royal Dubs Presents:
Stepping Into Darkness
September 20, 2008

Cyrus from Random Trio . Dubstep . London, UK - RTP, Tectonic
http://www.myspace.com/randomtrio, randomtrioproductions.com

One of the early pioneering DJ/producers of the sound we now call 
Dubstep, Cyrus from Random Trio 1st began his dj career back in 1998 as 
a ukg Dj. After just 3 months of mixing Cyrus was given his 1st chance 
to play for a local promotion in Croydon, shortly after he was offered a 
residency and never looked back. Various pirate radio shows followed 
along with more bookings for local clubs in & around London. The summer 
of 99 saw Cyrus take his dj'ing to the island of Corfu (Kavos). In this 
time Cyrus had met and became good friends with fellow Random Trio 
member Omni, and by 2000 were doing most of their dj sets together. They 
1st formed a little crew in 2001 consisting of themselves & 3 mc's and 
soon gained a good following. They built their 1st track by the end of 
the year and had heard interest from a major label. However before this 
took place they split going there own separate ways. Cyrus and Omni 
carried on dj'ing together and decided to carry on making beats for 
their radio shows. It was around this time they 1st heard Horsepower 
Productions and were taken aback by their unique style. They found the 
sound they were looking for. By 2003 Cyrus had made a batch of tunes and 
brought out his 1st release on their imprint RTP. This was the Lost City 
EP. January 2004 saw Cyrus with his own show on London's biggest pirate 
Rinse.fm.. One of the early nights was a night put on by DMZ called dub 
sessions held on a Sunday at black sheep bar in Croydon. With a newer 
member, Omen, Random trio have a number of successful releases and more 
recently Cyrus's From the Shadows LP. Random trio have played at clubs 
all over the world from Finland to California and look forward to the 
future.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

**A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

First let me say I'm not voting anyways I'm not endorsing the other
douchebag

If you think you are a liberal and you vote for Obama / Biden you are an
idiot. McCain is more of liberal than that asshole Biden. Biden created the
Drug Czar and RAVE act. The guy is an asshole and one of the biggest Drug
War proponents.


Liberal is supposed to mean FREEDOM. Drug War zealots are not about freedom.
Biden is one of the most dangerous conservatives in this country. The War on
Drugs has done absolutly NOTHING to reduce drug abuse. All it does is feed
the prison/industrial complex. The USA incarcerates a greater percentage of
its population than any other nation yet calls itself "Land of the Free."
All the war on drugs does is create a black market and dangerous criminals.
The same way alcohol prohibition created Al Capone. The victims of the War
on Drugs far outweigh the victims of drug use.

Obama/Biden = change? What a fucking joke.


REVOLUTION NOW!!!!

Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) forced the controversial legislation commonly known
as the "RAVE" Act through both houses of Congress as an attachment to an
unrelated child abduction bill. The "RAVE" Act, also referred to as the
Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act of 2003, was introduced as an addition
to the Child Abduction Protect Act of 2003, widely recognized as the AMBER
Alert bill (S151). The "RAVE" Act had not passed a single committee before
being attached to the AMBER Alert bill. In addition, it was so controversial
when it was introduced during the 107th Congress that two Senators withdrew
their sponsorship.

Most people who say this don't own any weapons, much less possess the
willingess and ability to use them against the government.

It wouldn't take more than a half percent of the population to actually
hold this belief to make it happen, but it always seems that, in the
end, there's a lack of minerals.

Heheh, you don't me very well do you. I've got nothing to lose. As a felon
I'm not *supposed* to own firearms. How many more people do we need to make
the .5%? We should at least burn tires on election day. Our primary target
should be stevie t since he is the primary owner of the united states
government.

Subject: {pb-cle} (PIT) Sunday 8.31. Dave Dresden (Gabriel & Dresden) @ Zen

Humanaut presents:

Dave Dresden (Gabriel & Dresden)

Opening duties by Paul Alexander

10PM

Sunday, August 31st (Labor Day Weekend) @ Zen

Multiplicity can be a curse or a godsend. In the case of Dave Dresden, the
constant jump between DJ and Producer, Journalist and A&R man became a
blessing. At a very young age, Dresden developed his passion for music
growing up in Connecticut. He frequented local dance clubs and became
friendly with a DJ named Moby, a local hero at the time, who would later
also serve as his mentor. His popularity grew quickly and demand for
Dresdens sets led to multiple performances weekly. But Dresden knew he
wanted more than to be behind the decks.

When opportunity knocked in 1996, Dresden changed his focus to radio. He
began his highly rated show "Electro Circus", which aired on Hartford,
Connecticut's modern rock station, WMRQ until 2000. His radio career
continued as music director and on-air personality for Groove Radio, an
internet radio station, and music supervision for Pete Tong's highly
influential Essential Selection show on the BBC Radio 1.

Always seeking new endeavors, Dresden became a dance music journalist and
began writing reviews and features for national magazines such as DMA, DJ
Times, and Mixer. Dresden was named a reporter to the highly regarded
Billboard Club Play chart. Dresden profiled Paul Oakenfold, Moby, Masters
at Work, Puff Daddy, Sasha & Digweed, BT, The Crystal Method, The Chemical
Brothers, and Deep Dish, to name a few. Many of these artists first
American press came through his journalistic efforts.

In 2001, everything changed when Dave Dresden partnered with Josh Gabriel
to form the internationally successful DJ/production duo, Gabriel &
Dresden. Soon after the group formed, they gained recognition through
their numerous remixes for dance tracks such as Tiesto's "In My Memory"
Way Out West's "Mindcircus" and Above and Beyond's "No One On Earth", as
well as pop titles such as "Don't Leave Home" by Dido and "Intuition" and
"Serve the Ego" by Jewel. Their first single, "Lament", was released in
2002 on Satoshi Tommie's Saw Recordings, received much critical acclaim.
Since then they have released 3 full compilation albums and, in 2006,
their self titled debut studio album, which was named as the "2006 Album
of the Year" by M8 magazine.

Dresden's contribution to the duo led to 18 #1 positioned singles and
remixes (and two others with both Chris Cox and Attention Deficit) on
Billboard's Club Play Chart. The worldwide smash hit which Dresden
released with Josh and vocalist Jes under the alias Motorcycle, "As the
Rush Comes", hit the #1 spot on the US's Dance Radio Airplay chart for the
year 2004 and peaked at #11 in the UK national singles chart.  As DJs, the
two reached #20 on the prestigious DJ Magazine Poll for 2006 and, more
recently, Gabriel and Dresden won Best American DJ in 2007 and 2008 at the
Annual Winter Music Conference International Dance Music Awards. After the
awards, in March 2008, Gabriel & Dresden decided to part ways.

Dresden's solo career continues to accelerate with the same drive,
determination that he began his career. His various successes have allowed
him to remix artists such as The Killers, Annie Lennox, Sarah McLachlan,
Duncan Sheik, Britney Spears & Madonna, Paul Oakenfold, and many more. His
new single "Whole Wide World " which he co-produced with Chris Cox is
currently being played on Tong's Essential Selection, and his newest remix
of Radiohead's "Nude" can be heard on Dresdens Myspace.

With Dresden's extensive touring schedule, as well as several solo
releases and remixes, there is no doubt that Dresden's star power is
shining brighter than ever before.

Subject: {pb-cle} Illusion of Safety - The Need To Now [expcd002]

NOW AVAILABLE
Illusion of Safety - The Need To Now [expcd002]
http://www.experimedia.net
Illusion of Safety, Dan Burke's ongoing and ever evolving project
since 1983, contributes a fantastic new album to the experimedia
catalog. A hand signed and numbered limited edition release, The Need
To Now is one of Burke's more stark and minimal works.  While more
minimalistic overall, The Need To Now still embraces Burke's penchant
for broad dynamics, building from soft tones, drones, and distant
whistling to maddening noise and back down to near silence with just
the smallest trace of air space. Music box like tones dance loosely
throughout constructed industrial ambient environments.  Soft
crackling, static and noises fizzle in and out of focus while subtle
guitar rises quietly in the distance.  Deconstructed voices, samples,
rhythms, and instruments arranged into brilliant sound montages in
ways reminiscent of the classic GRM school of tape cut ups.  A
soundtrack for sedated asylum inmates.  This masterful work by one of
the veteran heroes of avant-garde post-industrial music aims at
activating modes of perception, deprogramming reality, and recombining
information pointing toward a new reality/environment. The Need To Now
comes packaged in experimedia's signature tall slim pack and features
the photography of Chris Block.  Strictly limited to 150 copies. Your
order of the limited edition packaged CD includes immediate bonus
downloads of the album in highest quality MP3 and/or lossless FLAC
formats so that you may begin to enjoy the album before your package
arrives.

Jeremy Bible & Jason Henry - Shpwrck [expcd005]
http://www.experimedia.net/
Jeremy Bible and Jason Henry's Shpwrck, is a beautifully diverse opus,
bringing together a wide range of acoustic instruments and field
recordings through unique processing and arrangements.  Dark and
minimal yet oddly comforting, Shpwrck's wide open spaces succeed at
creating exotic environments illustrating the duo's growing attention
to detail at crafting and bringing together delicate textures into
lengthy abstract sound art montages.  Subtle breaths of musicality lie
amongst constantly evolving beds of atmosphere. Touches of gritty
surface noise and found recordings approach from the distance and
momentarily come into focus. Shpwrck comes packaged in experimedia's
custom signature three panel folding tall slim pack featuring the
photography of Jeremy Bible and is protected in a clear poly sleeve.
Your order of the limited edition packaged CD includes immediate bonus
downloads of the album in highest quality MP3 and/or lossless FLAC

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

[i love it! a "LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE"]

LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE!!!
Date: 8/28/08
Time: Doors open at 9pm sharp
Venue: Metropolis 2325 Elm St Cleveland OH. 44113
Ages: 18 to enter, 21 to drink
Cost: $25 Advance (Limited Number Available)
http://www.wantickets.com?e_id=43273
$30 before 10pm @ door; $35 there after


Israel-bred, LA-based psy-trance duo INFECTED MUSHROOM--Amit .Duvdev. 
Duvedevani and Erez Eisen--have been playing to increasingly massive, 
frenzied crowds all over the globe (over 135 shows in 2007 alone), 
thanks to an explosive live show that.s far cry from the staid 
stereotype of dance acts hunched over their laptops and turntables. This 
year Infected Mushroom.s big plans encompass numerous tour dates 
throughout the U.S. and major studio time working on their seventh 
album, due out this summer.

Infected Mushroom will kick off their 2008 tour dates March 13 in 
Austin, TX during SXSW. Joining Duvdev (vocals) and Erez (keyboards) are 
tour guitarist Tommy Cunningham and Brazilian drummer Rogerio Jardim. 
Here the industry will be able to check out a live performance of 
material from Infected Mushroom.s upcoming album and experience 
first-hand why such major festivals as Coachella, Vegoose, Miami.s Ultra 
Music Festival, San Diego Street Scene, L.A..s Monster Massive, Virgin 
Festival in Baltimore, Camp Bisco and Sao Paulo.s Tribe have highlighted 
them on their stages. Other markets Infected Mushroom is confirmed to 
perform in this year include Houston, Dallas, Boulder, Miami, Denver and 
Los Angeles.

2007 was a landmark year for one of electronica.s biggest bands. Besides 
all the aforementioned festival dates plus a headlining slot for over 
500,000 people (last New Years Eve in Rio De Janeiro, with the Black 
Eyed Peas and John Legend), they now rank #9 Overall and the #1 
Psy-Trance Artist Worldwide on DJ Magazine.s prestigious Top 100 DJ 
Poll. The band have moved to Los Angeles to get serious in the studio 
and began working on the follow-up to their album Vicious Delicious.

As told to Allan McGrath of DJ:

.In the last year we.ve come out of the psy-trance bracket, which is 
where we want to go,. Duvdev explains. .We.ve been playing rock venues, 
which we.re happy about as we never wanted to be categorized.. .We.re 
happy that people come and see Infected Mushroom even if they aren.t 
into psy-trance,. adds Erez. .We.re always looking to things we haven.t 
tried before.. Fans of their classic psy-trance pulse need not be too 
concerned though. Already, two of the tracks laid down for their next LP 
are ferocious psy-trancers . with recent tracks .Sayid. and .Nine 
Percent. instigating a full-on reception in their recent live shows. 
.There.s another track called .Black Shwarma. which blends cool lyrics 
with distorted heavy metal guitars,. adds Duvdev..

Sun Aug 31                      DAVE DRESDEN                     Pittsburgh

Humanaut proudly presents:

Dave Dresden (Gabriel & Dresden)

Sunday, August 31st (Labor Day Weekend!) @ Zen

Multiplicity can be a curse or a godsend. In the case of Dave Dresden, 
the constant jump between DJ and Producer, Journalist and A&R man became 
a blessing. At a very young age, Dresden developed his passion for music 
growing up in Connecticut. He frequented local dance clubs and became 
friendly with a DJ named Moby, a local hero at the time, who would later 
also serve as his mentor. His popularity grew quickly and demand for 
Dresdenâ..s sets led to multiple performances weekly. But Dresden knew 
he wanted more than to be behind the decks.

When opportunity knocked in 1996, Dresden changed his focus to radio. He 
began his highly rated show "Electro Circus", which aired on Hartford, 
Connecticut's modern rock station, WMRQ until 2000. His radio career 
continued as music director and on-air personality for Groove Radio, an 
internet radio station, and music supervision for Pete Tong's highly 
influential Essential Selection show on the BBC Radio 1.

Always seeking new endeavors, Dresden became a dance music journalist 
and began writing reviews and features for national magazines such as 
DMA, DJ Times, and Mixer. Dresden was named a reporter to the highly 
regarded Billboard Club Play chart. Dresden profiled Paul Oakenfold, 
Moby, Masters at Work, Puff Daddy, Sasha & Digweed, BT, The Crystal 
Method, The Chemical Brothers, and Deep Dish, to name a few. Many of 
these artistsâ.. first American press came through his journalistic 
efforts.

In 2001, everything changed when Dave Dresden partnered with Josh 
Gabriel to form the internationally successful DJ/production duo, 
Gabriel & Dresden. Soon after the group formed, they gained recognition 
through their numerous remixes for dance tracks such as Tiesto's "In My 
Memory" Way Out West's "Mindcircus" and Above and Beyond's "No One On 
Earth", as well as pop titles such as "Don't Leave Home" by Dido and 
"Intuition" and "Serve the Ego" by Jewel. Their first single, "Lament", 
was released in 2002 on Satoshi Tommie's Saw Recordings, received much 
critical acclaim. Since then they have released 3 full compilation 
albums and, in 2006, their self titled debut studio album, which was 
named as the "2006 Album of the Year" by M8 magazine.

Dresden's contribution to the duo led to 18 #1 positioned singles and 
remixes (and two others with both Chris Cox and Attention Deficit) on 
Billboard's Club Play Chart. The worldwide smash hit which Dresden 
released with Josh and vocalist Jes under the alias Motorcycle, "As the 
Rush Comes", hit the #1 spot on the US's Dance Radio Airplay chart for 
the year 2004 and peaked at #11 in the UK national singles chart.  As 
DJs, the two reached #20 on the prestigious DJ Magazine Poll for 2006 
and, more recently, Gabriel and Dresden won Best American DJ in 2007 and 
2008 at the Annual Winter Music Conference International Dance Music 
Awards. After the awards, in March 2008, Gabriel & Dresden decided to 
part ways.

Dresden's solo career continues to accelerate with the same drive, 
determination that he began his career. His various successes have 
allowed him to remix artists such as The Killers, Annie Lennox, Sarah 
McLachlan, Duncan Sheik, Britney Spears & Madonna, Paul Oakenfold, and 
many more. His new single "Whole Wide World " which he co-produced with 
Chris Cox is currently being played on Tong's Essential Selection, and 
his newest remix of Radiohead's "Nude" can be heard on Dresdenâ..s 
Myspace.

With Dresden's extensive touring schedule, as well as several solo 
releases and remixes, there is no doubt that Dresden's star power is 
shining brighter than ever before.

Lea Luna Englewood, CO
East Music/Tascam/Skull Candy

Electro-house goddess DJ Lea Luna has been on the up-and-up since 1999, 
rocking many a crowd from underground to commercial, across the US and 
abroad. Her white-hot enthusiasm on stage and in the studio reflects her 
9 year career, which has been gaining exponential momentum since she 
first stepped up to the decks as a tiny teen. "I'm taking my music 
further this year than I ever thought I would have when I first started 
spinning records. Its unreal how many different avenues there are inside 
electronic music: how many subcultures, how many diversely beautiful 
artists, fans and enthusiasts there are. After having the privilege of 
exploring this world and the music in it, I've become a pioneer. I'm 
writing, collecting, and spinning styles that don't even have names to 
them yet. This is truly a divine epiphany, and it's redirecting my 
course in life as a professional musician." She has had numerous 
solely-featured event ads, interviews, and blurbs hailing her appearance 
in dozens of US cities, as well as magazine, billboard, tour guide, and 
television representation overseas. Her broadcasts include internet 
radio Teklab. fm racking up millions of listeners worldwide, 
Clearchannel's Denver-based 93.3 FM, KGNU Boulder, and a past history of 
college radio at UCLA and Metro State University in Denver. "Love and 
music are the only universal languages, and I speak them both so 
fluently and intermittently."-Lea Luna

Eric D
Eric began playing around at his friends' houses on their turntables in 
1993. He started playing out in 1994, and quickly got into promoting 
when he threw his first night at a venue in Pittsburgh, circa 1996. 
Having been a major part of the underground movement, he was involved in 
throwing the "Renegade" parties under the West End Bridge by the river. 
He was 1/2 of N'Sync Productions, having thrown one of Pittsburgh's most 
monumental events, "Journey To Delphi" back in 1996. By 1997, along with 
others, he formed the 412 Collective, which continued to throw 
consistently good events.
Moving to Columbus, Ohio in 1998, he was responsible for the "Kikit" 
parties, as well as "Escalate" Tuesdays and "In Motion" Wednesdays, 
showcasing the best and up and coming local and regional talent. If you 
were in the scene back in the mid to late nineties to the turn of the 
new millenium, you probably heard Eric's unique style at events like The 
Family Affair festivals, Transformations 1 and 3, Revolutions 1 and 2, 
and many other one off events during that time. Last year he made his 
return, playing in Ohio at Family Affair 6 once again, for the first 
time since 2001. Once again, we're proud to bring you the sound of the 
dj... Eric D.
Since the start of his dj career in 1994, he has been rocking many 
dancefloors from Washington, D.C. to Kansas City, and everywhere in 
between. Coming to us from his residency at Vue Ultralounge in Georgia 
he's ready to bring it to the 216 once again. His style has gone through 
many changes with the times, but one thing remains constant - The 
relentless flow of energy throughout his sets. Consistently bringing 
blends of many different genres, knowing what you're going to hear next 
is almost impossible. His signature style of smooth, flawless mixing is 
not to be missed; you're definitely going to want to be on the floor for 
this one.

Sat Sep 20                 STEPPING INTO DARKNESS                Cincinnati

Royal Dubs Presents:
Stepping Into Darkness
September 20, 2008

Cyrus from Random Trio . Dubstep . London, UK - RTP, Tectonic
http://www.myspace.com/randomtrio, randomtrioproductions.com

One of the early pioneering DJ/producers of the sound we now call 
Dubstep, Cyrus from Random Trio 1st began his dj career back in 1998 as 
a ukg Dj. After just 3 months of mixing Cyrus was given his 1st chance 
to play for a local promotion in Croydon, shortly after he was offered a 
residency and never looked back. Various pirate radio shows followed 
along with more bookings for local clubs in & around London. The summer 
of 99 saw Cyrus take his dj'ing to the island of Corfu (Kavos). In this 
time Cyrus had met and became good friends with fellow Random Trio 
member Omni, and by 2000 were doing most of their dj sets together. They 
1st formed a little crew in 2001 consisting of themselves & 3 mc's and 
soon gained a good following. They built their 1st track by the end of 
the year and had heard interest from a major label. However before this 
took place they split going there own separate ways. Cyrus and Omni 
carried on dj'ing together and decided to carry on making beats for 
their radio shows. It was around this time they 1st heard Horsepower 
Productions and were taken aback by their unique style. They found the 
sound they were looking for. By 2003 Cyrus had made a batch of tunes and 
brought out his 1st release on their imprint RTP. This was the Lost City 
EP. January 2004 saw Cyrus with his own show on London's biggest pirate 
Rinse.fm.. One of the early nights was a night put on by DMZ called dub 
sessions held on a Sunday at black sheep bar in Croydon. With a newer 
member, Omen, Random trio have a number of successful releases and more 
recently Cyrus's From the Shadows LP. Random trio have played at clubs 
all over the world from Finland to California and look forward to the 
future.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

**A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

The only reason he did that was because he was thinking about running for
president. I don't support DPA it was the first thing that poped up when I
typed RAVE ACT in google. The only sliver of hope I see is that McCain dies
and Palin gets the hot seat. I don't know enough about her yet. My intial
findings on her look better than the other 3. This is the best drug reform
site IMHO http://stopthedrugwar.org/home

"=85from a policy perspective, it's a disaster. Biden has sponsored more
damaging drug war legislation than any Democrat in Congress. Hate the way
federal prosecutors use RICO laws to take aim at drug offenders? Thank
Biden. How about the abomination that is federal asset forfeiture laws?
Thank Biden. Think federal prosecutors have too much power in drug cases?
Thank Biden. Think the title of a "Drug Czar" is sanctimonious and silly?
Thank Biden, who helped create the position (and still considers it an
accomplishment worth boasting about). Tired of the ridiculous steroids
hearings in Congress? thank Biden, who led the effort to make steroids a
Schedule 3 drug, and has been among the blowhardiest of the blowhards when
it comes to sports and performance enhancing drugs. Biden voted in favor of
using international development aid for drug control (think plan Columbia,
plan Afghanistan, and other meddling anti-drug efforts that have only
fostered loathing of America, backlash, and unintended consequences). Oh,
and he was also the chief sponsor of 2004's horrendous RAVE Act."
Biden is a snake. The way he slid the RAVE act through was worse than the
PATRIOT act. He snuck in a destruction of civil liberties on something mean=
t
to help abducted children.
