It's a general clothing/magazine/mixtape kinda store.  Time Bomb make 
their own clothes, and sell other things of urban trends.  It's kinda 
like a small Avalon, with a more hip-hop feel to it.  Anyways, the store 
opening party was fun.  It started off with Saint and Sine tag-teaming a 
lot of techstep, then grrl13 and I showed up with our records and it 
wound up being saint/sine/grrl13/tea.farmer quad city DJ (heh) tagteam.  
I had fun mixing it up with them, and people generally just stood around, 
checked out the magazines, took pictures, drank wine, ate food, etc.
  
After a while, the hip-hop acts showed up and Supa C took over the 
turntables and O Lab and OuttaReach hooked up their ASR-10's while W and 
Demented Wordsmiff rhymed on the mics.  The PA got mad distorted at that 
point, with ASR-10's cranked too loud, but other than that, the very live 
feel to it all was fun.  It wasn't all that new to me, since there's a 
live hip-hop/ASR-10/mic session at my house every damn week-end :-), but 
it's good to hear the stuff the O Lab and Demented work on in a different 
setting once in a while.

I recommend checking out Time Bomb just to see the crazy T-Shirts they 
have there.  In case you need directions, it's accross from the Giant 
Eagle on Shady Ave. where the coffee house used to be.

Do you want vinyl, or mixtapes?  Dieselboy's CD is a mix of other peoples 
tracks, so I'll assume that you are looking for mixes to listen to, not 
vinyl to spin on your own.  I know that there are a lot of new mixtapes 
out this month and if you check some stores like Time Bomb, HyperVinyl 
and Future Sounds you're likely to get most of the newest mixes.  

New mixtapes I've seen this month:

sine
adair
tea.farmer

this _is_ in congruence with what the "old fashioned" flyer says tho.
chances are whoever typed up the e-flyer were confused and not even
affiliated with the party.  i'd say it's a $35 lineup anyway, i mean look
at it!  it's outta hand.  btw r notorious j is not on the flyer but the vm

personally I'd suggest getting mixtapes, since you usually get more bang
for the buck than cd comps ($10 is about the price limit for mixtapes),
plus (usually) newer tracks. like farmer tea said - check out local places
for local dj's stuff - there's lots of good tapes.  if you don't mind
paying big $'s try www.pureacid.com ->  they have lots of good tapes from
all over the place...

if your just looking for compilations or albums, there's actually lots of
good stuff out, depending on what styles you like...I'm sure lots of old
stuff like "This is Jungle Territory" and "Welcome to the Jungle" with old
raga stuff are in bargin bins by now, and both are good albums in my
opinion.  "Pure Rollers" and "Breakbeat Science 1" are probably my
favorite compilations and each have about 90% good tracks, but both are
getting kind of old.  Some new stuff that's pretty good is "Stricktly
Bussiness" (Reinforced), "Groovrider presents: Prototype Years"
(Prototype), "Drum & Bass World Series" (Joker)...all of which you can
pick up on cd.  i don't like all the stuff on these albums, but they're
still worthwhile.  its pretty much a matter of taste what styles you like.

i just was thinking about something.  (please don't be too surprised :P)

a lot of times, when people post about the things that bother them about
parties nowadays..."candy-ravers" come up.  as in "...all the bullshit,
designer clothes, designer drugs, overpriced parties, candy-ravers, shitty
sound systems, shady promoters, no-show dj's..."

why?

who are the candy-ravers hurting?  at least they are there to party.  they
don't care about what record this is, how long it's been out or what label
it's on.  they don't care about who is fucking who, which drug dealer is
clocking the most bank, which promoters are shady, which dj is on, who
didn't show up.  they don't care about getting a new $200 windbreaker to
wear to the next big event.  they don't care about which hotel room they
are going to party in until monday with the rest of their drug-dealing
friends who still live with their rich parents.  they don't throw attitude,
they don't complain about how good it was back in the day.  they don't
really complain at all.

i think all the other "rave archetypes" do a lot more to hurt the overall
vibe of a party then the candy-raver kids do(yes, i'm as guilty as you).
they are always standing their in their glitter and their tummy shirts,
bright orange and silver clothes, waving their glowsticks, with a little
kids' backpack full of fun.  they are always ready to give you a hug and a
blowpop, smack a sticker on your shirt or sprinkle you in glitter.

and i might be wrong about this...but i think when all is said and
done...it's the candy-ravers that had the most fun.

maybe we can all learn a little something from them?

this just in from the ppl upstairs here at hyperreal:
hyperreal.org is being phased out in favor of hyperreal.org the reason
behind this is that the .org (organization) is more inline with the
hyperreal mission, rather than .com (commercial).  so i guess the thing to
do is change your bookmarks, address book, and links.  i'll try and answer
any questions the best i can.  tnx, trouty.

as far as making an assumption about Junglists in general.  But, there is
some truth in that Jungle is the dark side, hardcore, schooled crowd, and
thats why there IS a sepatate room...  Myself, I haven't worn out the scene
by any extent, and I love deep house, horn samples, hugs from strangers,
candy ravers, glowsticks, the smell of baby powder, and being myself.

some candy ravers are funny.  like this one guy that's inviting me to spin
at his house on fry-day.  he really looks like he should be very
homosexual, then he opens his mouth "fuck dude, pack a bowl" in this hellla
deep voice.

Hyperreal's mailer has been configured to automatically change this, so
his email may have been confusing.  (This already happened on the AH

Yeah, I got Welcome to the Jungle, Goldie's album Timeless, and Suburban
Base's DJ Hype Selection #3 all at Jerry's used CDs in Oakland for $5 a
piece! I agree with Geoff ... go for the mixtapes.

Candy Ravers carry such a stigma & I really think that it is unfair.

I do not consider myself to be a candy raver < lord knows I have had my
fair share of lollipops & stickers> but I really respect a lot of candy
ravers. 

Honestly, I have not always felt this way- they used to annoy the ?@!# of
me.  I always used to wonder what they were so happy about anyways. Why
were they so happy & I was so miserable- it is because they choose to be
happy. Thier happiness really helps make a scene better.

I think people sometimes are just so used to jaded cynical insincere jerks
that they do not know how to deal with people who are happy- it makes them
uncomfortable & jealous because they are differnt. < sorry if I sound like
your mom>

But anyways, I would just like to thank all you crazy candy ravers <
except all the ones who like to rub my belly> who have really made my
parties a lot better. You have picked me up when I have been down-
you who have given me rides, candy...yummy & stickers when I was not
feeling the vibe. Your smiles have really made my life better.

I feel so chessy.....
But keep the energy youth & innerchild alive.
peace.

i dunno why so many people wanna know how i felt about josh not showing 
up this past wednesday @ u4ia or whether or not i'm going down again again
tomorrow night...at first i thought i would just shut up about this...but 
people keep askin me...why duz my opinion matter so much?...i'm just a jaded 
ole fuker anywaze...but perhaps if i let y'all in on all the things things i 
think about even thru a li'l event such as this you'll understand why i'm so 
jaded now...

PRE-EVENT BS 

so i get home from work @ 11:30pm...workin night shift sux...but it pays 
well

christa calls & i tell her i'm gonna see josh wink tonight...wish there was 
enuff technology to zap her into cleveland from columbus...but she sez she's 
got class tomorrow morning anywaze...long distance relations sux...but i luv 
her

so i call monica cuz she told me to...she sez she'd meet me @ the club w/ her 
friends

i page reggie & he never returns my page

i even checked my e-mail if kate or gill (FOL) wrote me back...no luck

luckily i've disconnected my v-mail so i don't hafta waste time deleting
hang ups w/ that any more

i call lisa...and jen from columbus answers the phone...she sez she knows me...
and i feel like a moron for not being able to figure out who she wuz...she sez 
she's gotta go pick up lisa @ her work & they're going straight to the club

so i make the 20 min trek alone from east side to west side cleveland

NO JOSH @ U4IA

i'm greeted by club kid rick @ the door...i refrain from askin him whether he 
remembers me from when i picked up ronnie (FOL) from his place way back when...
he tells me josh wink was not able to make it...i'm immediately overcome by 
feelings of extreme dissapointment and theorys of wackness fly thru my head but 
immediately attribute it to my extreme jadedness w/ the scene now...but atleast 
they were honest about it & didn't wait until you got in...ironically rob 
sherwood (FOL) pops up behind me...he informs me that josh had missed two 
flights

so i'm standing there wonderin what i should do...wonderin if monica turned 
around & went home w/ her friends or is waiting inside...i notice aron is 
standing there by the door passing out mezcla flyers...i ask him if jeff wuz 
inside, he tells me he turned around & went home...i ask him whether he saw 
monica go inside...he tells me he doesn't know who monica is

while i wuz talkin w/ aron, willie & wendy come out, but before i finished 
talkin w/ aron, they were gone...it wuz just odd because the last time i saw 
josh wink i went with them to indy...that night josh had to announce four kids 
had passed away on their drive home from indy to kentucky...and it wuz in 
kentucky that christa lost control of her car & almost went into a truck w/ 
her friends on her way back to columbus...so many bizarre coincidences...i 
won't even mention the girls from columbus on their way to cleveland...too deep

then kevin bumpers pops up from behind & i ask him whether he wuz spinnin...
he sez no, but mike filly (FOL) is...then alex tik tak (FOL) pops up w/ his 
records & sez he'll be going on late...i tell him i'll stick around for him 
(mostly cuz i felt so guilty for missin so many of his partys)

"SORRY I'M NOT THERE"

i go inside & am surprised there's quite a nice sized crowd despite the wink no
show...eventually i find monica @ a table w/ her friends...she introduces me to 
'em...monica's got some fly girl friends, but i've got a girl...then i noticed 
titonton @ another table...i wuz kinda shocked he came out all the way from 
columbus...he tells me he drove up w/ walt, melissa, & desmond...i apologize to 
all the columbus kids that they drove so far to be dissapointed...i even buy 
walt (FOL) a drink, but it wuz mostly becuz i felt guilty for missin his last 
party - funkenbumpen...but i explained i had to miss everybody's party...it wuz 
the politically correct thing to do...especially when i bumped into kevin gank @ 
bent crayon & he asked me whether or not i wz comin out to summer jam '97 and 
there i wuz droppin off ele mental flyers...so i had to skip everybodys party to 
be fair

ironically enuff chris pulse and chris calabreeze (FOL) greet me at the bar...
chris even got me a drink...i apologize for missin his last party...chris pulse 
goes into this long shpeel about how i don't have to apologize for missin partys
...i tell him well real friends are always there for you....and lately i've been 
missin everything becuz i've been so busy w/ work & school & seein christa in 
columbus...they took things pretty well considerin how i slammed 420 v2.0 on the 
net

it wuz around this time rob (FOL) played the pre-recorded tape josh made 
explaining how he regretted not making it out to cleveland and how he missed 
two flights...he said some other stuff but i couldn't make it out...anybody 
hear what the rest of his shpeel wuz?...but i guess rob kept on playing it 
through out the night...i think he even started remixing it...i even joked 
that rob should put out a track..."Sorry I'm Not There", especially since josh 
sampled him for "Are You There"...."James Brown Is Still Alive!"

then chip from eyegasm (FOL) pops up by the bar & offers to buy me another 
drink...i end up buyin him one...cranberry & absolut (it wuz just odd cuz 
that's what scotty & ian used to drink all the time)...i ask him if he saw 
gill...he tells me he didn't see gill but he saw kate on the dance floor...
we end up shootin the shit for a long time 

then cathryn sister spinsta pops up by the bar...and of course i had to 
apologise to her for missin mezcla..."Sorry I'm Not There"...i ask her if she 
had seen lisa since they had waitressed at the same restaurant before...she 
said she wuz out on the dance floor

on the way i bump into kevin & jesse...we discuss LL's (FOL) li'l mishap...
i told him i felt bad cuz i really should've had a li'l chat w/ her at 420...
and if any thing like that ever happened to either of them, i would've felt 
just as bad...neither of them seemed to care very much & walked away

then i bumped into titonton again...and since the theme of the night wuz 
"Sorry I'm Not There", i told him i just bumped into cat & apologized for 
missin him @ mezcla...i made another deeper apology... i think he finally 
understands why i really go to columbus all the time now...he gave me a 
big hug

finally upon arrival on the dance floor...i saw lisa up by the front, but 
decided it would be too much of a hastle to cut through all the dancers...
i ended up just starin at sleepy c (FOL) spinnin and all the dancers bouncin 
away at all his mad beats...how nice to still have your innocence and be able 
to dance your night away w/o a worry in the world...i complimented stephen on 
his nice set before he left, but he didn't seem to care very much...but i 
know it's becuz thru the years he has become as jaded as i am...he prolly 
thinks the only reason kids talk to him is to kiss his ass for one thing or 
another...he may have just wanted to go home to be with sandy...some one he 
knows that really cares about him...i don't blame him...sandy's definitely 
one of the good ones...she wuz the only one that bothered to ask why i looked 
so depressed that one night @ abruzzi's by the bar when they were doing the 
bump friday nights there...

i ended up by the side of the dance floor watching alex (FOL) spinnin his 
jungle set when i noticed brian wheeler (FOL) standin by the side...i 
remembered i still had my family affair photo album in the back of my car so 
i went out to go get it...i brought it in & showed it to him...a small crowd 
gathered around him flippin thru it...so i walked off to dance a li'l

mike filly (FOL) wuz there by the side, he wuz sportin these kewl glasses 
that kinda reminded me of ian (FOL)...so i go to him: "okay mike, who's older 
& been in the scene longer you or me?"...at first he pointed to himself than 
he laughed and pointed at me...yah it sux being the oldest one on the dance 
floor...but then carol came up & gave me a big hug...i told her i called up 
her coffee shop to apologize to her cuz i missed her last party also & wuz 
shocked to hear li'l mary wuz gettin married...she said it wuz ok & told me 
she'll be starting a new club - Fluid...but i  =wuz also smilin cuz i knew  
she wuz one up on me :)...

i tried dancin for a li'l while then gave up & took a seat to watch the 
other dancers...it wuz alot easier when i didn't know as many people & didn't 
have to think so much...eventually brian (FOL) finished looking at the photo 
album...i asked if he wanted to keep it...but he said it was better if i held 
on to it...i told him maybe it would be best if i missed it this year cuz i've 
missed everybody else's party and plus things have become so jaded for me...i 
don't think he understood my question, but i did see him on the dance floor 
that night

some one lost their contact lense or something close to where i was sittin
...that's when i noticed amanda, the girl i took to IO2 wuz sittin close to 
me the whole time...we never exchanged a single word with each other that 
night...prolly cuz she knows she never paid me for her part of the rental 
van...and this is where the jadedness starts...and when the process keeps 
repeating itself in one form or another...you just don't know who to trust 
anymore

pretty soon after alex (FOL) finished his set i wuz the only one left 
sitting there w/ my FA photo album sitting next to me...i went on stage to 
compliment alex on his set...eventually the only ones left in the building 
wuz the owner, chip, alex, filly, carol, rob & club kid rick. filly almost 
walked out w/ my FA photo album before he left...but i got it back...so here 
i am the owner of this huge photo album w/ photos of kids most of which i 
don't really know...have i really wasted all of my time, my money, & my 
energy on something that is really worthless?...but i guess that's why i 
wuz lookin for gill that night

before i left i went up to rob sherwood & asked him: "in the beginning when 
u were spinnin at the aquilon [the whiskey now] it wuz all about the music 
right?"...rob answered "yeah and to eat"...and that is all i can really say 
about that...but i guess i wuz one of the dumb ones that stopped listening
to the music long enough to meet some of the people that have been comin
out to all these events 

on the way out i asked club kid rick if he still talked w/ dan the man spam 
(FOL)...since we were all stuck together after dan's car got towed after THINK
...he said he hadn't seen him around lately...i commented that i thought dan 
was a pretty good artist...he was also the one who introduced me to chinagrrrl 
(FOL)..i never completely understood why she & so many others have dropped out 
of the scene, but now i'm understanding it more & more...

tomorrow night keoki is spinnin @ U4IA...i really don't think i would go even 
if keoki did show...but at the same time i realize people like rob, the other 
dj's, the owner of the club, the sound people, the light people, the bartenders 
need to eat...but then again now i realize i've gotta eat too...and i really i 
don't have the money or the time to feed everybody else now

alot of things happen for a reason...maybe it was good josh was not there...if 
any thing it made me think about alot of things that i needed to think about i 
guess

Yeah, I got Welcome to the Jungle, Goldie's album Timeless, and Suburban 
Base's DJ Hype Selection #3 all at Jerry's used CDs in Oakland for $5 a 
piece! I agree with Geoff ... go for the mixtapes.

Can we just stop here once second.  A majority of these "problems" extend
from the "candy raver mentality"

1. Most candy ravers do lots of designer drugs.. (we joke about smoking
them and getting a buzz)
2. Most candy ravers are so fashioned out they look rediculous.
3. Most candy ravers buy support the shady drug dealers by buying their E
from them.
4. Most candy ravers support shady promoters because...
	a. They don't know about the music, and really don't care.
		a. This supports promoters that don't throw good parties.
	b. Are just their for the drugs and the party.
		a. Don't support the DJ's or the promoters who are straight.
	c. Don't care to realize what the whole thing was originally about
to begin with... the music.
5. Most candy ravers support the big parties for the big house djays, and
the big drugs.
6. Most candy ravers don't care about a shitty soundsystem because
everything is cool when you are on E.

Remember, without the music there would be no vibe.

Anyone can have fun on 3 hits of E, and no cares in the world..

>>maybe we can all learn a little something from them?

Maybe, you never know.. I might learn how to handle hard drugs.  Get my
fashion tips so I look like I am 3 years old.  Possibly they could tell me
were I can find that raging Tickle me Elmo doll.  Perhaps they can direct
me to where I can buy plastic clothing.  Perhaps I can look like I am 12,
perhaps, I can learn how to fit in with all the trendy 15 year old candy
ravers.  Perhaps I can.. be an complete idiot when it comes to knowing
anything about the scene.  Perhaps I learn how to do the same fucken "hat
dance" everyone else does in Rave land these days.  Perhaps I can learn
were the fat pants are the fatest..

To be honest with you.. They are worse then a roach infestation.  Hell they
act like roaches when they jump into their E pit at a party.  Spralled out
on the floor.. Saying they love teh PLUR.. but for real, can't realize the
all this couldn't ever have been done with out that record that was
spinning..

Fuck em.

no one able to communicate the jade like you did needs a kick in the ass.
in fact, its hard to cultivate a sense of mental pride when you know
everyone is wrong but cant show them how they are. this is when you start
thinking they are right..which really fucks things up, because then you
forget what threw you off the common path in the first place, which was
also why you thought everyone was wrong, which was what gave you
stimulation and hope that you arent a part of some organized system that
people like to talk about..something encouraging: being wise, experienced,
and able to relate to the bulk of people without actually being like them.
at the same time however, one might wonder if they would be a lot happier
if being like them.

above are all "discontinuous" feelings some of us headz go through..long
periods of these feelings may be the root of jade. positive discontinuous
feelings are those dynamic spurts of excitement one gets when some thikng
incredible happens, making you feel on top of the world and young as hell.

one time at a party someone told me "whatever you've been through, i've
been through"
i actually believed him. he made me feel young agile and full of life. he
also told me other things about  other things and was there if i had a
problem..he was completely jaded.

anyway the point is that  ive been wondering about these old skool/new
skool feelings myself lately, and i look at it this way: age is just a
number, but experience is a rate. the speed at which we think determines
the energy flow. in other words, the slower you think, the deeper you think
you're getting. the faster you think, the more you think you are doing.
whatever the case may be, regardless of age and previous experience, the
vibe is detrmined by the average rate of thinking of a crowd.

knowing that i probably completely missed your point, i can relate. the
experiences you see at clubs and events which completely throw you "out" or
tie you "in" are forces of unity. if you see yourself as too old or two
young, that is because you are either living at a relatively slower or
faster rate than the majority of the crowd.  There is no need to worry,
however, because the people vibrating at the mean rate look at the slower
thinkers as "wiser" and they look at people in the higher rate and see them
as "agile."  the important thing here is that mean people look at different
frequencies for encouragement, and you look at mean frequencies for
pleasure, or whatever that bullshit is supposed to mean.

one of the simplist things one can learn from quantum mechanics is that
higher frequencies of light have a higher energy level.  assuming that
light is made of the same stuff we are (also what quantum mechanics
assumes), this explains why i dont really like going to parties with a lot
of crystal going around. i feel old, tired, and slow because my frequency
of process is below the average. when i hang out with people who are smoke
up, the equation is reversed in my favor. i feel fresh, rejuvinated (sp?)
and ambitious, because my frequency of process is above average.

likewise, feeling unity pulling you in is when you are in sync with the
average frequencies, and feeling discontinuous is when you are not. if you
find yourself feeling discontinuous more than not, its time for a
relocation, in my opinion. walking around a lot is usually what i do at
parties.

relativity is a simple thing, but being as jaded as some people think i am,
then even explaining it makes me feel slow, so ill stop.

this guy is funny:)
there is some truth to the candy-ravers being part of the problem in terms
of supporting bad promoters, but that definately seems to be a matter of
preference. regardless, weve heard both sides.. the
lets-go-to-a-party-and-have-a-lot-of-fun and the
lets-go-to-a-party-and-hear-some-good-music ... these are the two types
that need each other... whose gonna like your music anyway, much less pay
for it, if it werent for the candy-ravers??

there are "thing" people and there are "people" people. "thing" people care
about the records, and try to know the names of labels. "people" people
care about the records if they can enjoy its familiarity. Regardless of how
much you think the candies dont know about the music, they probably will be
more responive to a familiar song, while you willl probably be more
reflective and act as if you don't care for it because you already know it.
(maybe not, but perhaps you will that act like everyone should know it)
This is a very "thing"-esque thing to do. The "people"-esque person will
enjoy it, even recite the lyrics better than you can, so they can recreate
the intial experience of hearing that song. (btw, im assuming youre a
"thing" person)

to be fair, "people" people care about promoters and dj's more than the
music, and will thus like the music more if the dj is a nice guy and like
the party more if the promoter is a fun guy to talk to.It is also not fair
to say that candy-ravers always have the best time because when they dont
like the promoter, the dj's or the rest of crowds appearance, they will
complain about it. whats interesting to me is that both "people" people and
"thing" people are influenced by the music, and keep coming back for it.

 you need both of these kinds of people, just like you need both the left
and right sides of your brain.
most candies are "people" people... most dj's are "thing" people. most
everyone else is a shady promoter, even though they havent thrown any
events. :P

another thing...this E thing... Raves did not exist before E... ...if you
dont believe me, do some research about it. netsearch MDMA party people.
Raves will die when we forget how to make E.
E is not a rave phenomena, rave is an E phenomena.

IF the rule of thumb here is, if i can get better drugs somewhere else,
there is no way im going to fucking washington county fairgrounds,
obviously people that will go to washington county fairgrounds just for the
E are stupid and will eventually stop going to parties when they get a
dealers phone number so they wont have to bother with this "rave" thing to
get their fix.

one more thing: candy ravers tend to be richer, but remeber that
pretentious and snobby behavior is free.

well a lot of times they put mE in the cHILL rOOM, i have no idea why, i am
not a beatless ambient dj, so i play my stuff, and like sometimes there's
not too many people dancing, just the ones that has had eNOUGH hard trance
and wants to get down get mellow get funky and finish their acid trip.  =]

well at least that's what someone said.

hi everyone :)

i'm not gonna hype this party up (anymore) -- by now, those of you who are
going have made your plans already, and i hope to see *many* of you there
:)
ok, some ppl have asked for directions...real basic east coast
directions...i recommend taking interstate 80 thru pennsylvania instead of
the pa turnpike because you save like $25 in tolls and the road itself is
in much better condition...i just took 80 last weekend roundtrip from
pittsburgh to nyc and it was cool.

ok from nyc:

(IF ANY OF MY DIRECTIONS ARE WRONG, I'M SORRY :) I DID THIS FROM
MEMORY...PLEASE BE KIND ENOUGH TO POST THE CORRECT DIRECTIONS TO THE LIST)


take the lincoln tunnel out of nyc...follow nj state highway '3 west'

take 3 west to 46 west (be on the lookout for the split to 46 west...i
think its on the left side of the road, as u pass under a bridge, but dont
take that as fact)

from 46 west get on interstate 80 west...

once you pass the delaware water gap, you are in pa...

email me privately if you want the exit # of the rest stop that has phones
you can make free long distance calls from :) !!

and also there is a factory outlet mall at like exit 44? that has nautica,
ralph lauren/polo and tommy hilfiger stores among others...so u can get
your phat gear (tm) right before the party :)

ok...back to the directions...take 80 west all the way out to clarion pa
(near exit 12 on the pa turnpike) and then get on 79 south towards
pittsburgh

take 79 south until u see the signs for the pa turnpike (interstate
76)...head WEST on the turnpike...u are headed towards akron/canton...

thats the best i can do for ya now folks :) doug-e will post the detailed
direx later, but that at least will get you to the vicinity.

...it will be either ridiculously hot during the day and shade trees get
taken fast at the campsite/and then real cold at nite...shorts and
sweaters/sweatshirts boys and girls...OR it will rain and itll be ohio's
version of 'furthur' ...

blah blah things to bring: lots of clothes, esp ones u dont mind getting
trashed...2 pairs of beat up old shoes...*dont* think this is the party you
are gonna unleash your new $140 nikes at :)

toiletries...first family affair had no running water, yech :) second one
had showers and sinks and toilets...but it was in this CREEPY little
shack...like maybe 6 showers in there...dont drop the soap ;)  
u dont know what might crawl up your leg :)

flip flops, sandals etc...necessary...you dont want to shower
barefoot...you kids are smart enuff...the rest (extra toilet paper,
toothbrush, blah blah) you can figure out yourself :)

there is also a k.o.a. campground like 5 minutes up the road from where fam
affair is at.. this place is nice (i stayed there the first year) they have
big clean bathrooms, a pool, alot nicer than the campsite, but u also dont
get to be with everyone else 24/7 which *is* the party in my opinion :)

(coming from bmore/dc...take 68 west instead of the turnpike as well, the
scenery there is unbelievable (mtns of WV) and its a free road...take 68 to
morgantown where you will take 79 north and then follow the signs to the pa
turnpike, and then head towards akron/canton)

pretty much the only place u NEED to get on the turnpike from is if u are
coming near or thru philly...but like i said its a shitty road thatll cost
u $25 roundtrip (its like $12-15 in tolls from philly to pittsburgh)

im gonna be mcing for 187...he's doing a live pa both friday and saturday
nite...so please come up and say hi afterwards, ok? :)

i think this is more than enuff information as it is....but email me
(hossam@topsecret.net) if u have any questions...last time i will check my
mail is 5pm thursday.


drive safe and be careful....we're gonna have mad fun this weekend :)


peace,
hossam

Hey all. 
I must admit that I don't speak up very often on this list, but I have to
agree with this.  The candy ravers arent hurting anybody and of all my
party experiences, I think that some of the nicest people Ive met fall
into the candy-raver category.  The thing about a "backpack full of fun"
is so true.  It can get cheesy, but at the same time, they make up a part
of the scene.  It takes all kinds, right?   

I have to agree that some of the things the candyravers stand for are the
kinds of things that I wish werent in the scene, but to me, as long as
they are there and not being violent or shady, I dont care what they are
on.  Shadiness is my worst nightmare!  Whoever is not throwing shade is
automatically on my a-list.  

So, I must also thank the candy ravers for remaining a part of the scene
and keeping people smiling and laughing even when they are being dogged by
a bunch of other people standing around refusing to talk to anyone but the
folks they showed up with...

Don't worry about it.  I've something to say as well.

I'm an candyraver and I'm proud of it.

I admire people who still believe in PLUR and go to ravers (or 
houseparties, or parking lot-get-togethers):  I think it's healthy and a 
good way to have fun.

I love toys:  Whistles, lightsticks, pacifiers, Genesis joypads, what 
have you.  They're fun.

It's nice to leave being cynical in the car when going to a rave (a rave, 
dammit, not a party, a RAVE!!!) and dance until my joints squeak and my 
hair is dredded to Roswell and back from the sweat.

If anyone looks down upon so-called candyravers, I will ask you to stand 
up, go over to the nearest reflective surface, and take a good look at 
who you were when you started raving so long ago.

What do you see?

What do you remember?

I can't answer that, because I can only speak for myself.

If you still want to write messages that complain about the kids who are 
just getting into the scene and don't jam on jungle for hours on end, 
that you're more h4r|>c0r3 then they are, then go right ahead.

Me?  I'm going to be out there in my tye-dye robe and 'shades hugging 
people and welcoming them into the scene.

If the scene was the same old people, it would never grow.  It would 
never change.

It would get boring.

If I ever see a rave that makes me want to head out for popcorn and a 
nap, I'll be at the end of my lifetime.

Let's hope it never gets to that.

in pittsburgh.. since then, nothing to move me.. now im really picky on what
i like, so in a sense in not the best person to lisen to.. to refer to other
peices of conversation. i am very jaded.. to the point i won't go to a "rave"
unless its promises to be way cool for my buck.. over 15% better be supper
kick ass. like 2 kick ass [not house or jungle] outta towners and atleaset
{ATLEAST 1 live PA] but thats of the subject..
i dunno. ploping is good. you can lisen to lots of techno you know.. its soul

Word Misc...humans have this deep desire to label things.  It's a name game
that's been around for millennia.

I don't mind that people are using the moniker 'electronica' for it.  It is
electronic.  And it is a better descriptive than 'techno.'  The main thing
to realize here is that the majors seem to be calling it electronica as a
generalization, a shortening of 'electronic music.'  I think all of us in
the lists have played this sort of _name game_ before, after all what
really is 'drum & bass,' 'ambient,' 'trance,' et al?  Don't they often
cross?  He he he.

It is really just as Miscellaneous says...it should make you feel, as with
any good music, it evokes a personal response.  I just have to add my bit
to Miscellaneous' lot:  it should also make you _think_...

Everyone,

Today's my last day of work.  I'm moving to Santa Clara, CA next
Thursday, so I'm signing off this list.  I just wanted to say thanks to
everyone, especially mskw1 for the EXCELLENT projekthaus parties and for
letting me do my shit live, farmer tea for doing the tape comp (lemme
know when it's done--I wants a copy!), and brian & michelle (lunatik &
anaphase) for letting me play on their radio show.  There's lots more,
but I won't babble on now.

If anyone needs to contact me, this addy will still work in the future.

peace,
and remember, 
it's all about the music.

thank you for saying this.
i absolutely HATE how the word "rave" has been magicly replaced
with "party" over the years.  if i want to go to a party, i'll
go to college.

and just to add my 2 yen on the whole candy raver issue,
i LOVE candy ravers.  i don't care what drugs they are on because they
don't try to sell them to me, they don't let them disrupt the party,
and they use their drugs in a productive way for the other RAVERS by
adding adrenalin to the vibe.  the reason i go to a rave is to dance and
have fun, and candy ravers do nothing to distract from that.
now all you poser pot smokers sitting in your corner clockin' the honeys
are another story.

love,
ryu

A Rave is a party!  It's also an event, but you can't deny it's a party
as well.  I personally like the term "party" and think the term "rave"
is overused.
that's my dos pesos,
Johnny

********************************************************************************
A question comes up for me....what do you call weekly
'techno events' at clubs?  I think they're too small (among other
things) to be called a 'rave'.  And I agree with Matt on the
party definition...sounds like a frat thing.  Any textbook
definitions out there? :)

i know i may be sounding a bit cliched or naive or utopian, but i always
thought raves to be MORE than just a party or an event.  before i say
the big "M" word, let me save time be agreeing with any contrasting 
opinions on the topic of the fact that raves at one time aimed to be a 
universal Movement, and not just a party.  yeah yeah, nothing changed and
it never would have, but it is fun to think optimisticly sometimes.

when i think of a party, the first thing that cums to mind is alcohol,
buzz clips, gluttony, and irresponsibility.  that is why i don't like to 
use that word interchangibly with "rave".

when i think of an event, i think of high ticket prices, arenas, and
people who are watching something.  that is why i don't like to use that
word interchangibly with "rave".

i don't care what is overused because i don't care what is popular.

call me anal retentive.  call me contradictory.  call me pointless.
call me Al for all i care.  just don't call me just to say you love me.

love,

Okay, when Im at a place that has lots of people who go to parties, I call
it a party, but when the people are new, I call it a rave (just so they
know what Im talking about).  It works pretty well, but then you have to
get into the whole fright-fest thing they have going on in the media about
it...
I dont think either definition should be frowned upon.  It seems to depend
on how low key/laid back you want to be about it...

a weekly 'techno night' at club is usually just called a 'weekly'.

Amen! 
I've been wanting to say that for a while now. Those that make fun of
"candy ravers"
need to check themselves. Most people now either don't know or don't
remember why
raves first started. They started as an alternative to the snooty "my
clothes are better than
yours", "I'm better than you", "I can dance better than you", "your weird
because
_______", vibe of most clubs at the time. I remmeber when I discovered
raves back in
1992 they were a temporary world where you could  do what you wanted,
dance how
you wante, dress how you wanted,  etc. I remember that a large part of
what we call vibe
was due not to how many superstar DJ's were on the lineup, not due to who
had the most
expensive gear on and certainly not due to high schoolish cliques. It was
due to the spirit
of open mindedness not simply tolerance (as it is now), sharing and
learning with/from
total strangers (not just your immediate clique) and making new friends
etc. When
exactly did becoming a walking billboard for Polo, Nautica and the like
become cooler
than being original or wearing fun fur, floppy hats, glitter, white gloves
and brite colors?
Probably around the same time that the rave scene moved from warehouses
and fields
into the clubs and the free expression raver adopted  the club
stereotypical mindset. Back
in 1992 there was no such thing as a "candy raver" we were all candy
ravers to some
degree or another.  Back then you could not conform for 8-12 hours, it was
like a
wonderland.

Yep and they have fun unlike quite a few other people I see in my travels
nowdays. It
kind of makes me wonder what all these other people are getting out of
this? It's usually
those people who are not having much fun who feel the need to poke fun at
the ones that
are. It is no wonder why most of us old schoolers have dropped out or
moved on to other
things. Raving has just become another "thing to do" not a special oasis
apart from the
real world. It's sad but raving as I knew it back then died about 3 years
ago. Two weeks
ago I  MCed  for D-Cypol at an old school party in Toronto. It looked and
felt to some
degree like it was back then only I didn't feel part of it. I felt like
one of those outside
observers you see lurking around parties. This past weekend I performed in
NYC at the
Achorage (INSIDE the Brooklyn Bridge).  While I felt  part of everything I
didn't
necessarily feel that energy nor did I feel it was ok to do whatever.
Comparing the two
provides a good contrast of then and now.

Yep. I sometimes wish I had stayed one as alot isn't much fun anymore.

> maybe we can all learn a little something from them?

Yep,  if raving is to continue into the next century it has to  ressurect
that unique,
anything goes vibe. Back to the Future! Otherwise it will stagnate and die
or become
absorbed as just a techno concert for the
mainstream-lowest-common-denominator folks.

I'd have to disagree, though it's a difference in experiences that is 
relevant.

For me, a party is a bunch of people standing around drinking and 
cliquing up.  Not fun for me.

A rave is something where people actually DO something.  Dance, for the 
most part.

Lots of fun for me.

I hate feeling like a git saying 'rave', like it's so 'five minutes 
ago.'  Fork dat.

I'll see your two pesos and raise you a meseta.

nah, but i think this duz...

[ jabber aka christopher newhard on why we go to raves from a post
  on ne-raves a long, long time ago...]

===================================================================================

why do we go to raves?

 ...to hear incredible music, to dance, to explore warehouses, to roll around in
dirt, to socialize, to take a road trip, to explore a new city, to take a nap,
to deprive myself of sleep, to exchange smiles, to make new friends, to watch
dj's mix, to hear more incredible music and dance some more, to evade police, to
make friends with police, to hug people, to gaze at a full moon and the stars
around it, to watch other people dance, to watch a sunrise, to step away from my
weekday life and gain a new perspective on it, to meet aliens, to meet locals,
to practice telepathy, to feel bass vibrate my inards, to collect flyers, to go
to some public place with fellow ravers after a rave and be laughed at by
non-ravers because we are freaks, to experiment with drugs, to learn about
myself, to learn about others, to learn about our ancestors, to learn about our
world, to make our world a smaller place, to collect stickers, to draw, to paste
stickers on other people, to de-stress, to watch lasers, to write, to play with
glow toys, to play with toys that adults wouldn't otherwise play with, to act
like a fool, to watch video toasters, to share a ride, to share my food and
water and candy, to share my thoughts, to help create an incredible vibe, to
share that incredible vibe, to hear some cool music see some cool lights, and
dance a bit more...there are a million reasons why I go to raves but this is all
I can think of at the moment. I don't rave for any _one_ particular reason. Or
do I?

If it were only about music and nothing else then I would buy records and take
them to the public library and sit myself in one of those little cubicles with a
record player and headphones and I would isolate myself from the rest of the
world so I could concentrate on the music and nothing else. If it were only
about music and dancing then I would steal the record player and take it to my
secret hideout and dance the night away all by my lonesome.

No, it is all a bit more complex than just music and dancing, I'm afraid. So I
ask myself what is the main thing that keeps me coming back? What makes me put
jillions of miles on my car every weekend? Why am I at raves despite seeing
things that really bother me nine months into this little adventure...  like
people fighting, people stealing my shit which is a big problem lately, people
that _absolutely_ have to find some kind of drug before they begin to think
about having fun...

Yeah raves in general make me extremely happy, but why? Why not just listen to
this wonderful music at home if that is what it's mainly about- the music? Oooh
this has had me stumped for the last couple of hours trying to figure it all out
but now that it finally hit me it is so simple...

It is YOU all that keep me coming back... You know the main points I threw out
at the beginning of this message? - listening watching exploring learning
sharing etc... Well I have discovered a group of people that is extremely
passionate about listening, watching, exploring, learning, and sharing like no
other group of people I have come across before. And I also think we are
passionate about doing all this _together_ and because of that we bring out the
best in eachother like no group of people I have ever seen before. Does anybody
understand what I am saying? I am really struggling to put this into words and
when I read back over it I'm not sure the point comes across...

Yes we have our little differences, and yes there are people who do nothing but
detract... But in general it is the PEOPLE I see around me that keep me coming
back for more. The fact that I can look around me and see people having more fun
than they should be allowed to, dancing, listening, watching, learning, sharing
- people that are busy figuring out what they can give to our little scene
rather than looking for something to take away from it - that is what continues
to amaze me the same as it did on day one.

So I guess this is my answer. Yes I go to dance and to hear excellent music and
for other reasons. But the main thing that keeps me coming back for more is that
I enjoy the company of all these incredible people. When I stop finding these
people - that is the day I will just sit at home and listen to the music.

=================================================================================

are YOU there?

What you think of as a party is all from your experiences with them.  
I've been to alot of parties that were just as good as a rave and danced just 
as hard.  Maybee you've had bad experiences with parties (stay away from 
da frats).  I've litterally seen more people dance at a good party than at a 
rave...and had just as good a line-up as a small rave.

Unfortunately I've been to a PB-Cle rave before that was pretty much alot of 
people cliquing up and getting fucked up.  It wasn't cool.  I have friends who 
sometimes get fucked up at raves but they dance their ass off and add to the 
vibe, on the same hand I know people at parties who drink and then dance and 
add to the vibe.  
    Where I'm from, Dallas, they started calling raves parties to keep 
them more underground and to keep the cops away.  You could also tell what 
kind of raver a person was by how he/she refered to a rave.  I'll admit it, 
years ago, I used to hate the term party and now like it.  It's a more open 
term for me   
    I guess what it comes down to is vibe and elitism.  I've been to 
parties that have had great vibes that's why I have no trouble calling raves 
parties.  I see where if you've had bad experiences at parties you wouldn't 
want to call a rave a party (even though I don't agree with that thinking).
As far as elitism goes I think part of the reason people insist on the term 
rave is to make the event sound elite.  Part of raves appeal is it's 
underground and elite nature. 
    In the end what you call it isn't important it's the music, vibe, 
& people of the fiesta that make it something worth while!

Right on!
Even though I was a bit sinacle calling raves elite in my last message
you can't forget why they were started or why we go.  
One last thing on calling Raves "parties".  In all practicle sense I
have no problem calling a rave a party.  In a purist sense there is a
definite distinction and wouldn't call a pure vibe rave a party.  I just
haven't been to a pure vibe rave in a long time!

Joe, you always have a way with words!  This is very true.  People need
to let loose a little more at the raves, show a little flair and have
fun.

I don't know about some of you but I have noticed than the term "rave" has
been used by most club owners as a way of charging a greater admission.
When in fact all that they are doing is playing the exact same thing that
they play on a weekly basis only with a new title tacked on to appeal to
all of the people who may have heard the term rave used on MTV's AMP.
There are just so many people out there who need someone elses opinion in
order for them to believe that what they are listening to is actually good
music.  If everyone could just listen to the music for their own personal
enjoyment and not because someone else said that it was cool.  The world
would have many less closed minded people.

im surprised no ones mentioned the G-word: "Gathering"
its nothing more, nothing less, unless of course you want it to be.

its as advertised. if theres one thing for sure there will be a "Gathering"
of people. it may not be rocking enough to be a Party, and may not be so
influential superb and sublime to be a Rave, but dammit you get to see a
lot of different people:)

me an friend use to call them "Conferences"...where we could meet all these
crazy scientists and share in the partaking of musical, anthropological and
sometimes chemical research, but that was when we were surrounded in the
adverse world of academia and made it a priority to blend all those big
lofty words and associations (which we hated) to the world of raving...it
provided a way to bridge the world of science to the Dionysian level, and
have an excuse to go have fun at the same time.

a weekly tekno night is a "Club", in my book, and the _act_ of "partying"
is more universal in associations than the subjective "Party" and sometimes
is more accurate in describing a rave to someone who knows what raves are
like these days, unless of course you say the word so naturally that it
slips off your tongue at the same time that your eyes smile that big cheery
haze of ecstacy often refered to as "raver gaze."

i also like "shin-dig" or "gig" sometimes too :)

Amen to that.  This might go on my wall...

*******************************@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@**********************************Ya know...these two posts made me think...well not really, I noticed this
before and the occasion has come up for me to bitch about it. :)

Though I know I shouldn't expect *anything* out of MTV...the few times
I've managed to catch they're late night "electronica" show, AMP, they
play nothing except what's on MTV's AMP Complilation cd.  At least
early on they played a little bit of variety.  The show sucked enough
in the first place, now it's just an infomercial to sell they're own
cd.

The lame got lamer...MTV carries on it's tradition. :)  End of Gripe.

Before anything else, I wanted to ask a favor... jeez, that sounds greedy, 
eh?  :/  :P  Well, since I'm only on ne-raves, I wanted to see if peeps 
from pb-cle-raves and dcraves would/could send me FA3 reviews... I'd way 
hardcore totally appreciate it.  :)

Alright... where to begin... I guess from the beginning, eh?  ;)  My 
weekend started at 5:45 Thursday evening when I got off work, ran home, got 
changed, ran to the greyhound station (fear) and headed down to DC to meet 
up with Douge... After listening to a few rekkids and getting way too 
psyched for the weekend, we ended up getting to sleep at forever late that 
night.  Heh.  The next morning, I woke up (er... was woken up... ;P  *lol*),
 ate, waited for Steve/Velure to arrive, and then we packed the car and 
headed out... the journey begins... ;)

[cuts out some stuff about rest stops, the restaurant that comes right out 
at you on the turnpike... "King of the Hill," rave hair gel, the blown out 
woofer, etc, etc... ;)]

When I saw the signs for "Bear Creek... Family Affair 3" with arrows 
pointing the way, I started getting the usual pre-party jitters... it was 
rad.  ;)  And then we got to the gate, saw Sarahs and Spike, Pete and Dyna 
(sp?), and then started driving to find a place to set up camp.

The place was HUGE!  Later on, we all started talking about where we were 
set up, etc... and Douge, Steve and I were right in center city, and a lot 
of our friends were out in the "suburbs."  *lol*  And then there was "Net 
City"... which, well, uh, um... What the HECK?!  *LOL*  j/k... It was all 
about *NOT* being net city.  But it's all good.  ;)  Well... we set up our 
tent, as pretty much everyone else was doing, too... and unpacked, etc, 
etc... then it was time to explore... ;)

[cut, snip, wiggle, jiggle, a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, 
snip snip]

That night it was *ALL* about seeing Bad Boy Bill at the main stage, but 
being that he wasn't on until later later, I decided to check out the 
*WHOLE* site... :)  The place was SO rad... so so so so so incredible.  Not 
only were the main stages way cool, but all of the little "booths" had some 
kicking sound as well...

hrm... lessee... 

Friday:  [cut about getting there, unpacking, setting up, running around], 
the fruit smoothie stand... MMMMMmmmmm... unga unga.  I danced to a lot of 
jungle Friday night... not sure exactly who I saw, but for the most part, 
it was all really, really, REALLY good.  :)  A *NICE* change from the 
typical Philly techstep.  Heh.  There was a bunch of jungle Friday night... 
which was cool, but I was in the mood for something else... so after a 
while, I sat down (honest!), and listened around, and found that one of the 
stages near where we were was playing some *NICE* hard trance/goa stuff... 
:)  It was *SO* rad... everyone was freaking out... :)  um, um... I 
dunno... I didn't sleep Friday night... but I did lay down for a little 
while... unfortunately I couldn't get to sleep because of some of the worst 
bootie house I've ever heard being blasted right next to our tent.  *sigh*  
Oh, well... 

Saturday: [cut about not using the scary showers, not eating, watching the 
sun come up]... Saturday morning I did most of my socializing... and that's 
when I found a whole ton of peeps... like Casey, Chris, Strawberry and 
POTATO!!!!  heh.  ("Chicken!")... and Beth, Pauly Pauls Haggard, Hossam, 
Crisbee & Jwan, and Joe and Stephanie.  :)  Poor guys... *lol*... fear of 
the "Ghetto Style" tent.  *LOL*  *hugs*  You guys rock!  I also found SO 
many people from Pittsburgh, which was nice considering how homesick I've 
been getting lately... a nice nice nice surprise.

Wow... some girl in the office just asked what I did this weekend and I 
told her and she was like way cool... anyway.  *cracked out*  

Anyway... Saturday day, um... I dunno... most of the day I was like "uh... 
blabber blabber spaz spaz rah rah rah unga unga!" freaking out to any and 
all music that I heard or walked past.  The two highlights of the day were 
the jump up little tent when I freaked out with Shannon/cheshiress and met 
up with Andromida... and they played my current favorite jungle track... 
"ain't armand."  *melt*  and then afterwards, they played (at the same 
tent), nice nice nice deep trance.  The second highlight being D.Cypol's 
set.  5:25 pm until 7pm.  So nice.  I can't even get into it... words 
seriously can't describe how much I loved the set.  I haven't heard happy 
hardcore at a party since Summer Rush like forever ago... and at FA3, 
everything was just, well, set right.  The perfect weather, the perfect 
crowd, a good sound system, everything.  I danced harder to his set than 
any other's all weekend.  If you saw my shirt afterwards, you knew it right 
away, too.  ;)  Heh.  *fear*

After that, I pretty much roamed around aimlessly looking for anything and 
everything I could do/listen to. I found a lot of people on and off... and 
not a single person all weekend was down, upset, or anything... it was just 
incredible.  After a while I ended up way in the suburbs... ;) ... and ran 
into Natty and Ben and Monk boy and Pam and, um, the boy whose name I 
forget.  Not to mention their chill little tent... so nice.  I danced there 
for a while until I made the girl laugh because I pretended to pull off 
someone's head, eat it, and throw it up.  Ack.  fear.

In between this time somewhere, I ran into our own Geoffrey the Giraffe... 
the boy is so rad... :)  Hopefully his leg will heal very, very quickly.  
:)  Sucks to see someone totally wanna freak out and dance, and not be able 
to... or at least not be able to the extent of "freaking-outage" that they 
want.  ;)  *hugs hugs hugs*  It was definitely rad to meet you.  

Hrm... Saturday night/Sunday morning I just kinda chilled with part of the 
DC crew... ;)  Poot and Caz and Strawberry and then we found Natty and 
eventually Ben.  :)  We were (or at least I was, heh) FREEZING... so it was 
*ALL* about making a fire... so we got some firewood and built one.  Fear 
of captain caveman stuck in the fire... *LOLOLOL*  ;)  ;)  ;)  *hugs*

After this, that and the other thing... we decided to go up at 6:30 to see 
Hardkiss spin... I dunno if it was supposed to be Scottie or Robbie... I 
think Robbie, but I dunno... and the most awesome thing was that, instead 
of him... it was Dubtribe!!!  :)  Now... this is pretty much the peak of 
this weekend for me.  So bear with me while I ramble on a little more.  We 
got up there with a little time to spare... a tight dj before Dubtribe, so 
it got me moving a little more than I had been, considering I hadn't slept 
in at least 20 hours before that... but anyway.  When Dubtribe went on, I 
freaked.  I knew the first track, because it was also the first track on a 
tape that I have of theirs.  So incredible.  I screamed my ass off.  I, of 
course, started dancing because I was just so psyched to hear them... but 
then, as Sunshine started speaking, I stopped dancing to listen to what he 
was saying... I figured I'd stop dancing and listen instead of dancing and 
listening so I could save energy and dance throughout their whole set.  
Well, instead, I was just forced to listen to every word he said... 

I won't get into every message that was portrayed, because I *doubt* that 
it has the same effect just saying it over the computer as hearing him 
sing/scream it live... but everything at those moments was just perfect.  
Literally.  There was no humidity, so dancing was nice... the sun was 
coming up over the mountain in between the trees and it was just 
beautiful... the music was incredibly relaxing, but still driving you to 
move, everyone had a smile on their face, everyone was beaming, putting 
their hands up in the air... and listening to Sunshine, I had no choice but 
to cry.  I've never had an experience at a party hit me like they did... I 
just felt like a part of something huge.  A part of something important.

There's so much metaphysical and psychological and philisophical stuff I 
could get into, all because of this party, but I think each and every one 
of us has gone through it before.  That's what our scene is about.  There 
are parties that we go to, and we say "okay, this party's all about the 
music" or "this party's all about such and such dj" or "this party is all 
about going and seeing friends that I haven't seen for a while..." ... well,
 this party was all about the vibe.  And how do you explain a party that 
was all about the vibe when it's more of a feeling, and less of something 
comprehensive?  I don't think it's possible.

Everyone that I hung out with, even for a second, made me smile.  I don't 
think the smile left my face all weekend... except for when I had to use a 
porta-potty.  ;P  *LOL*  So wrong.  But seriously... I'm still trying to 
decide if this is my favorite party of all time, tied or if it's second... 
once I think things out through my head (I still haven't slept for more 
than 5 hours straight since Thursday night), it might even be fourth or 
fifth place... but right now, it's just the greatest thing ever.

I won't name everyone that I saw there, because it's just too impossible.  
I usually give it a try anyway, but considering my current state of mind, I 
hope you'll all forgive me.  However, do wanna say that there were a lot of 
people that were missed this weekend... because I know that it definitely 
would have been an exceptional experience for them.  Nicole, you were truly 
missed by everyone... Frank, same with you... Craig, I heard some of the 
best hard house at one of the stages and thought of you... you TOTALLY 
would have fell in love with it... Mikey Barnes, you were definitely 
another missed bear... everyone was there in your tent except you... :/ 
GGGRRRRRR!!!... and everyone else I know... like, seriously... this party 
was meant for everyone... except for that scary person blasting pearl jam 
the whole party... ack.  Well, I guess even him, but w/o the stereo.  :P

Well, I'm hungry and I'm gonna go run and get food.  I can feel the ppd 
already kicking in.  *sigh*  Love you all.

Whoa whoa whoa, back the truck up! :)  Although E seems a huge part 
of the scene and whatnot, it did not start our scene.  Sure, E may 
have been around before raves, it was used by psychiatrists to aide 
in relationship counseling and also hypnotism I believe in the late 
70's (don't quote me on that :)   ..I started going to parties in 92, 
out in New Mexico...I moved to Ohio in 95..and I didn't see E at 
parties untill I moved out here...I had even done it once before I 
moved, but never saw it at parties...Granted, that was a different 
city,state, etc and things may have been different here...But I must 
say you are wrong in saying raves are an E phenomenon...

        i believe E is not essential to experience the true nature of rave.
It took me one and half years of raving to decide E was something safe and
fun to *try* and i enjoyed those months just as much as after i tried it.

        However, when i use the term "rave" i mean the "movement" in which
we reffer to. Raves, as we know them (mutually and exclusively differently
of course), objectively started in England and grew in popularity not only
because of the forbiddeness of them, but also because of the delightful
combination of LSD and MDMA. This is why they got bigger; to say people had
a very good time on these drugs is an understatement.
       On a macro-scale of group behavior, it is hard to overlook the fact
that raves did not become a marketable or successful thing if it werent for
the psychosomatic effect that most people felt under the influence of MDMA
and/or LSD, and the Lifestyle Police in the UK cracking down on Britian's
Youth. (however safe they were, which led the 'movement' to resume in San
Francisco). The growth in popularity of people dancing to loud repetitive
music in abandon warehouses is multifaceted, and I doubt that E alone is
the reason for its worldwide recognition, although it is the major
association people make with raves.
        E is not why we rave. I did not mean to say this. i chose to take a
strong stance in saying that the quality of our rave 'movement' was
contingent upon the distrobution, consumption, and synergistic effects of
E, and although E is not essential to make a thriving rave scene,  it is
part of what makes us (generally) feel collective; unified in our small
world, and stronger because of this collectiveness.  It is because the
average Joe does not understand the quality of feeling this way that we
feel united in a state of trance against or seperated from Joe.
        E enhances our feelings, emotions, and all those empathic and
feminine thoughts that come occupy the right side of our brain, the non
linear side. Rolling is cycling through these intuitional feelings
consciously, when normally they would be in the back of our heads, stuffed
away by logic and linear thinking (the left side of the brain). To me, this
process is what we have up on the rest of the world.  We know that all
people are filled with emotions and intuitions, regardless of how much they
express it, and we accept those feelings by acting small and
childlike..which accelerates our thinking..
        Anyway, the point is that *Most* people realize these things that
seem to create our little niche in intelligent society under the influence
of E *or* in direct  social contact with those who are, just like the
psychologists who studied these effects up until 1985 in America, 1977 in
Britain, and 1990 in Switzerland, who let about five doctors use it on
patients. In America it became classified as a designer drug, the most
controlled types of illegal substances. The DEA ignored petetions to lower
its control. I believe this was when the DEA was all up-tight about China
White. Some psychologists fought for its legality and usefulness, some even
continued to secretly prescribe it.
        The problem they encountered, which we have begun to encounter, is
the endangering low supply of it. You would think that there should be
plenty of it "rolling" around because it is illegal, but in reality the
supply is such that its either really expensive or really full of nothing
useful. This, to me, is the decline of rave as we know it... the rise of
"high-rollers" (because it is reserved to people who can afford it) and the
decline of quality underground parties (because it is substituted with
absurd kinds of narcotics, one would rather inject than swallow, if only
they knew what they were consuming). Does this sequence of events sound
familiar? Can anyone say.. Early 80-'s???
        Okay, so..regarldess of which came first or what started what, a
rave scene without pure MDMA is not as successful as one with it...Im not
trying to preach here, but i believe the reason why were all complaining
about how stupid raves are becoming is linked directly (but not soley) to a
decline in the supply of pure MDMA. Does anyone agree with me?

by the way...Drink Pepsi +)

=================================================================
>from columbus, cincinatti, louisville, lexington, & south

>71 north
>76 east
>77 south

my same dilemma as last year...

would it be faster to go 70 east to 77 north?  they look like about the
same distance to me...
==================================================================

actually the fastest way (and the way me & christa ended up taking
saturday night) wuz 71 north, 30 east, 77 south...15 minutes faster
than yur suggestion...we took 77 and 70 on the way back & timed it

btw the best deal for FA III wuz coming saturday night after 1pm
...that's the time we got in & there wuz nobody taking any money
@ the gate...best bargain i got since i got my nike acg's for $40
(orig. price $110) @ the jc penny outlet mall in columbus...but i'm
pretty sure brian would've hooked me up anywaze since i've been 
helping him out since the attik daze (after all i wuz the one who
hooked u up for it last year) plus i kinda helped save this party
this year by posting directions for it on the net when kids were
freaking out calling & e-mailing me when the UPS voice-mail wuz full

for the best deals & hook ups, contact...

	Hmmm....well, yes and no.  I think that if everyone entering
a rave were to be given mdma (free with a ticket stub or flyer
of course ;)) ...of course the vibe would be better, it's what the
drug does!  But after reading a post on here yesterday about
"A Family Affair III" and reading about how one subscriber was
so moved by the vibe, the atmosphere, the music...that he was actually
moved to tears (and I assume he was *not* on MDMA)...I really don't think
MDMA is *needed* to create a successful rave.  Whoever wrote that
post yesterday (sorry I can't remember the name), was so in tune with
himself, that he could open himself up wide enough to let himself
experience all of those tremendous feelings....and the ultimate
freedom is being able to do this without having to pop a pill.

so, it was finally that time of year again.  seems like it couldn't have
been a year already since we were at FA2, and *certainly* couldn't have
been 2 years already since the first one?!?  but it's true...

so friday we spend all day packing waaaay too much shit, as we weren't sure
about the weather.  good thing there were only 2 of us cuz the trunk was
full, and we weren't even bringing any food really. unless you count a
couple huge bags of candy :P  we dine on our last nutritous meal (wendy's)
for a few days, watch maximum overdrive and hit the road 9:30ish.  get to
see a lot of fireworks on the way.  70 to 77 is not faster.

hit the party about 11:45-12?  wander around and check things out a bit.
find out the schedule is a mess and we missed snuggles and 3D.  ah well.
talk to a lot of ppl we haven't seen in a long time.  check things out some
more, and marvel more than once at the sheer number of people there
(several reports said 7-8,000???? that place was pretty spread out and
there were certainly a lot of hippies, etc there...i dunno).  bad boy bill
fucking flattens the place at 2:30.  easily friday nite's highlight.  he
has more skills than a house dj should be allowed to have.  awesome.  by
now i am covered in dust and feel very gross.  i wander around a bit.  see
some more peeps i haven't seen in awhile.  some were pleasant surprises ;)


sometime later jeff samuel/stuff bursts onto the columbus RIDE SHAKE BOUNCE
FREAK jherico stage and drops mad techno science.  i wish there had been
more headz down there to take it in.  kimyon goes on and it's starting to
get light out.  we wander around some more, etc etc.  pretty much
uneventful til around 7 when we split and find a nice hotel about 6 miles
away.  wooo fun day, it's all about swimming ;)

get back at around 11:30.  sucks cuz we wanted to get back at like 7 but
the alarm never went off.  i put the same clothes back on from friday cuz i
didn't wanna ruin another outfit :P  initially we are told we missed
aphrodite and r notorious j, as well as joe187, titonton, todd sines and
d-cypol. and we were very sad about that.  BUT it turns out we *didn't*
miss aphrodite and everyone says r notorious j sucked a dick anyway.  i
dunno, he was badass at bassrush IV.  i am especially upset about missing
187 and d-cypol, cuz i've never seen joe play live and i NEVER EVER EVER
get to hear happy hardcore at parties.  but i guess d-cypol spun at like 6
and we would have never been back by then.

paul johnson went on at 12 and did what he does best...he played right to
the party, he knows exactly what the crowd wants to hear and when they
wanna hear it (the richie hawtin of house perhaps?).  he played that
basemenet jaxx song like 3 records in and the place was movin.  beautiful
nite, beautiful vibe...smiles everywhere :) :) :) :) :)

this is where things get crazy.  about 1 or 1:30, aphrodite steps to the
decks.  energy was thick in the air from paul johnson.  he opens with some
new mix (i think) of "funky beats".  the bassline drops and i thought i was
going to explode.  aphrodite absolutely fucking rinsed that place.  mc
sphinx/hossam did a wonderful job of hyping the crowd up, perfect mc for
this set.  rhea/mogli from cinti layed down some more intricate rhymes too
and i think there were one or 2 other mc's.  i have lately become convinced
that the only time we can approach the old skool party energy/vibe is
during wicked jump up jungle sets with equally wicked mc's and crowd
response.  everyone was movin', the whistle posse was in full effect, the
horns crew was in full effect.  the energy was too much.  i usually think
of big UK junglists coming to the states and not really taking us seriously
- yknow, showing up, getting paid, leaving.  but aphrodite looked
thouroghly impressed, he was all smiles and excitement as much as we all
were.  all i have to say is I GOT 5 ON IT!!!  that remix is the fucking
balls.  this is the way i remember it so please pardon any
chemically-induced nonsense - i heard it coming in and it was so perfect
and then the vocals dropped and we were like "ooooooooo it's i got 5 on
it!!" and then that bass hit and i thought i had just dissapated into pure
energy or some shit.  crazy crazy feeling.  i do believe hossam ran out to
the middle of the stage screaming REWIND at the top of his lungs as the
entire place fucking went ballistic.  aphrodite took it back from the top
and it was absolutely insane.  i didn't want this set to end.
soooooooooooooo gooooood.  oh and btw, if you think it's impossible to chew
the rubber guard off of a metal whistle and then chew the whistle
completely SHUT, think again.  my teeth hurt.

rebel crew tried to follow aphrodite.  but they suck.  a better plan may
have been to leave them in houston and give titonton the time slot.  but
who am i to say, right?  dubtribe was perfect, as usual.  their set ended
leaving everyone feeling beautiful.  *sigh*  me and a friend picked flowers
for sunshine and moonbeam but we couldn't find them so we gave them to each
other instead :)  the rest of the party was pretty uneventful.  it was
wonderful seeing a lot of people i had missed or not thought about in a
long time, but it sucked completely missing some people who i KNOW were
there.  i guess if i had stayed during the day i would have seen more of
them.

overall, a wonderful wonderful party.  the kind that leaves you feeling
fuzzy and PLURRY.  a perfect note to end on...as i, like many others, plan
on making this my last BIG event for awhile.  i know i'm leaving out a lot
that i wanted to say about it, but this is already ridiculously long.  i'll
leave you now to go about your business...

/H /S and have a ravey day ;)

HiYa Everybody !

This post contains info about: Submerge Internet broadcasts, the Technotic
Cinema, add your own info about internet real time broadcasts on our web site.

Well, it sure is feeling like summer now on the East Coast - our old friend
Mr. Humidity is making his presence known...but, on the good side there's
lots of exciting stuff  happening in space!

It's a good time to set yerself down in a nice cool area, turn on your fave
space program coverage, switch on your computer and chill out to some great
sights and sounds............And the sounds I (modestly) must recomend will
be broadcast on Wednesday and Sunday, 8pm and 12mn EST / 5pm and 9pm
Pacific.  This Wednesday is another episode of 'A.T.M.' (automatic techno
machine) and is loaded with goodies and slammin mixes, on Sunday is the
second installment of 'Head Set' a jam-packed experimental/ambient/space
music mix-up that I hope will trip a few people out!  All shows are 1 hour
long and will be broadcast from the Netcast VHQ multicast server. Get the
plug-in (for PC) and tune in to the Submerge channel there.....you can check
our web site for the playlist and other info...

For more info on Submerge, and to download the plug-in, go to
http://www.netcast.com
For more on the shows and the music we'll be playing, check out
http://www.technotica.com/music
 
Also also also!!!!!!  Rob did a great job setting up a coupla new areas on
the technotica web site...check out 'The Technotic Cinema' where you'll find
movies to do you in nicely that indivdually link to a wonderful movie
datbase for further info, and also also, Ta Da!!! ->  A calander for keeping
track of all the Wonderful real-time Internet broadcasts that have been
going on lately, and increasing in number and quality (we listened to Mr. C
and Darren Emmerson a few days ago live at 'The End' in the Uk the other
day, it was fantastic!!!)......as I said, there are SO many good ones now,
and it's so hard keeping track of them all, so we want you to add any info
you find, or, if you're promoting one...add it to our calender!!!  We are
looking into a way to distribute this info to interested people, perhaps by
mailing list or what have you....let us know what you think, and if you have
any suggestions we'll be happy to have'em!  http://www.technotica.com/techtime/

The Netcast shows are going to be every week, there are 2 a week right now
during the Summer, and we hope to be doing 3 a week in the Fall....the third
show is a funkier thing called 'Bassment Beats', and we'll be throwing one
of those in probly next week...I've just been in a really technoey mood lately!

Ok!  Welp, thanks for checkin this!  Oh yeah, I wanna add something about
the Submerge shows, this Wed show is very good slammin and funky and deep
techno and I reccomend it, and I HIGHLY reccomend Sundays 'Head Set'
show...I was really on a roll when conjuring that one up ;-)

Peace,

Linda Leigh/L3

Well, you have opened up a big can-o-worms.  For now, stick with vinyl.
THEN go to CD.  HOWEVER, if you want to use CD's, then damn it all, do
what YOU want to do.  There ARE strictly CD DJ's out there, just not too
many.

I will not comment further until an erroneous comment is made by another
party.

cd mixing is popular in some clubs, but more widely used in radio stations,
to my knowledge anyway... (i forget what the name of the model that most
club dj's use, but the mixer isnt what is different; the cd players are cuz
you can change the sampling rate just like you can change the pitch on
Techniques) the scratching is realistic but not rustic enough  in my
opinion. why would you want to press a button instead of touching the vinyl
itself anyway? (i love that feeling)

one of my friends was thinking about buying one and decided against it for
three main reasons; 1)records are cheaper 2)record players are cheaper and
3)if its on cd, its also on vinyl somewhere. (but not vice versa).

also, the average lifespan of a record given TLC is waaaay longer than
cd's...i dont know why everyone thinks cd's are eternal..man i still play
some of my dad's old beatles albums!  supposedly not only the binary coding
in them is sensitive to heat and light (jast as LP's are) but record
players are easier to fixz. the laser alignment in your cd player probably
will get fucked at the same rate as your needle does, and its very simple
to replace needles and even belt drives than it is to do whatever to a
laser... the guy will probably charge you $30 for opening the dam thing.
needles only cost 20 bills.

i think mixing cd's something that will never get popular at underground
events, unless its really informal and no one has tables; but thats a
matter of neccessity, not preference. If, like you mentioned,  you havent
given much thought of mixing your material, then your material probably
wouldnt be worth spening the commitment to it. BuY ReCoRdS! Practice on
someone elses tables and see how much better it will make you feel about
yourself..im serious..

Mixing cd's is going to be a big deal in the near future. There is no
real
advantage to vinyl other than the tools are inexpensive and common to
any venue - a mixer and 2+ 1200's. std. issue yeah ?
(audio purist flame retardant on:) 
When mixing music that is made (almost) entirely on computers there is
no improvement in quality by using vinyl. Don't get me wrong...
if your talking about say, a Les Paul going thru a space-echo, and then
into a vintage Fender amp (THink Neil Young and Crazy Horse) there
is nothing better than top quality vinyl for reproduction.
So then it comes down to the tools (ie 1200's v. CDJ500 cd player).
There are a few (Pioneer, Sony, Denon ?) that are trying to emulate
the ability to put your finger on the label of a disk, and push (ie
speed
up) a 12". This technology will become acceptable and viable soon.
There are many dual CD players available that allow you to beatmix
by pitch adjustment (+/-8% is common) These are less expensive.
There are also CD recorders on the market. I think this is going to
open up a huge avenue for creativity in that you can start making
your own disks for cheap. 
Granted, nothing will ever look as cool as someone bent over 
a mixer and 2 1200's with shinny tone arms floating on pure
black vinyl....

Well, if you already have a big CD collection, then it might be okay to
buy a CD mixer.  Here are a few things to think about:

1) do you ever plan on spinning out?  if so, don't plan on using CDs
because like you said, there are never CD decks at a party.

2) new dance music comes out first (and often only) on vinyl.  The
majoity of techno/dance/whatever music coming out on CD now is in the
form of mixed CDs, and you really don't want to spin with them.

3) You have about 100 times more control when spinning on vinyl, because
you can actually touch the record, whereas on CD you're restricted to
using the controls which simulate actual contact.

4) The scratch feature you mentioned on CD decks is a joke.  See #3.

So while I don't want to be a "vinyl elitist" like many people seem to
be, it's MUCH more viable to start a new record collection if you want to
spin than it is to use CD decks to spin stuff you already own.  

hope this helps,

chris (with the $25 turntable setup -- that DOES include both tables and
a mixer -- and it works well enogh for my purposes!)

i neeeed to say somthing. #1 for the price of the gear to mix, you can buy
some basis stuff to make your own music.
#2 if you going to mix, think.. what do you wanna mix? and to what quality.
the best mix's i have ever heard [technily] has been done with CD mixin.
the worst with vinyl.. 
basicly all clubs and raves.. suppliy 2x 1200's
not some crazy CD jazz..
#3.. get some crap record player.. [like 20$] start buying records. and
chill..
find some own with 2x 1200's.. and learn to mix. buy more records..and mix..

#4 and think.. why mix? for money? for fun? or cause "everybody wants to be a
D.j.  wika wa. boom boom boom" ..mixrace..

later

i prefer cd mixes myself.  the sound quality is better.
cds can now be pressed at home with a cdR.  anything that
can be done with vinyl can be simulated with cds, and while
it will not sound exactly the same, it sounds close enuff
to a guy like me who can't tell the difference between a 303 
and a basstation and who don't care none neither.
if you are just interested in bedroom mixing and making tapes,
then cds are the easiest and most practical way to go, but if
you want to play for a crowd, consider vinyl because it's far
more popular with other djs.  oh, and the cost of dj cd players
has gone down quite a bit.  you can get a rather decent single
deck one for less than one tech12 these days.

and to add an erroneous comment:
i find it odd that a culture like this one, which is so wrapped
up in technology and pushing forward and all that stuff,
can not embrace cds as a form of mixing.  ok, i'm done.

love,
ryu

this would be my counterargument from analogue heaven (not the list, the
state of mind i guess)

i find it odd that a culture(america) like this one, which continually
pushes the status quo as far as it will go, cannot hold on to analog or
magnetic recording techniques as an industry standard. the quality is in
the mix, not the hiss.

heres one to those who think the world of music should be ALL digital::
electronic signals travel via voltage changes, which are *slightly*
unpredictable. lets say you connect your cd player to your reciever. you
probably use some RCA cables.. they transmit electrons translated from the
binary data, so _technically_ speaking you have lost your digital "quality"
as soon as you attempt to hook anything up to your cd player :P

somewhere in the planes of marketing for convient music listening the cd
player evolved...which statisfied the low maintenence, advanced-looking
machine designed for the four second attention span mentality. you have to
be a little more patient with records, and in the early 80's that was not
the thing to be. (thats not when cd's were born, but when they became
popular)

last time i checked it was supposed to be about the music, not what looked

i'm not saying that analogue is bad or good or mediocre.

i'm not saying that the world should be all digital.
but i think that the quality of mixes can be increased with digital
technology.  the day will cum when two turntables and a mixer can be
replaced with one unit that stores tracks internally and can be retrieved
and manipulated at will.  the need for external peripherals (decks and such)
is becumming less apparent.  an example would be how aphex twin now tours
with a 2 channel mixer and a laptop computer and nothing else.  i'm not
saying that this is a better way of doing things, but that it seems
more logical given techno's forward moving attitude.

i don't care about what looks cool or not, but i think that digital
technology opens more doors to creativity than any knob or stylus.
what attracts me to cd mixing is that it:
-has less boundaries
-is easier to learn
-sounds better
everything else is secondary to me.

ryu

I've used them before, and I can't say that I'm that impressed.  The 
simulated scratching is essentially flipping frame by frame through a 
track.

CD mixing is tough to pull off, but it can be done.  Doing so WELL is 
entirely another set of header files.

I use CDs when I spin.  My advice is, get comfortable with vinyl before 
you start adding compact disks.  Don't take the bass ackwards approach 
like I did. :)

It's a good idea to bring one of your own, even if it's just a discman, 
and keep it in your transportation (a policy I abide by faithfully).

Question:  implied distinction between mix-CDs and compilations?

Amen to that!

Seriously.  Listening to the frames blink by loses its novelty quickly.

Actually, that would be 1 0 -1 1 0 0 0 -1 -1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 0 0 1 -1

	Hey, I was wondering if anyone on here went to Unity, and if so 
what did you think?  I didn't get to go, but am very curious how the full 
color argon lasar was!!!!!  Reviews of the DJs would be nice as well.  If 
you could send your posts to me as well as the list, that would be 
appreciated because I'm not sure if I'm currently on the list.

Thanks,

Sorry I haven't been writing.  I haven't been around my own computer for a
few weeks but Joe forwarded me an FA3 review and I have a couple comments.
(BTW Geoff, I'll have a stack of reviews for you in a jiffy.)  

First, I'm glad michael allroy had a great experience with Aphrodite.  I
remember feeling the same way the first time I saw SS and Warren G.
However, from a trainspotter's perspective, I thought his set was full
blast party energy but musically a little lax, like most of Aphrodite's
releases.  If you play 2 Aphrodite tracks at the same time, they have the
exact same breakdowns and buildups at the same measure numbers.  Still,
the man can make you get down and I needed that BADLY.  I think Nathan
Curry from the Breaks list described Aphrodite best when he said he looked
more like a rock band roadie in his tight jeans, old tee shirt, blonde
pony tail and basketball shoes than a stereotypical junglist.  

Yes, Sphinx did a great job.  I don't have any recollection of Paul
Johnson going on before Aph.  I believe that was 1.8.7.  In fact, if Paul
Johnson is the set I'm thinking of, I was none too impressed.  Also, I
quite liked R Notorious J's set.  I thought he sounded very at home
spinning more upbeat stuff instead of the darker tip.  Interesting side
note...He told me that he prefers to play more jump-up type stuff but
since he moved to New York he's been pressured to play darker stuff. 
Grrrrrrrrrr.   >:P

Number one clarification though, REBEL CREW ROCKED.  I haven't felt a
better party vibe in quite a while.  Everyone was into it.  It was great!
I mean, you cannot beat a sampler, an effects unit, tables and an MC
putting out fun electro.  Unfortunately I missed the jungle segment of
their set.  I think they were totally on point.

Everyone on the list has probably said everything else about FA3 that
should be said, except shouts to the Ghetto Stylee
"Tent-stakes?-We-don't-need-no-stinking-tent-stakes!" crew, did you know
the campground is on an old strip mine? and did anyone else have the
quaint experience of putting water in a bottle, having it look clear, then
12 hours later looking at it again and noticing that it had turned rusty
red and cloudy?  My co-worker, a filtration expert, says that icky stuff
probably PRECIPITATED from the water.  YUCK!  Well, that's what you get
on a campground cheap enough to rent out for the entire weekend, I
suppose. 

wuv,stephanie

I think it went well.  It wasn't exactly packed or anything, but it had a
good groove to it.  Anal as shit at the door.  Lights were
pretty happening. Massive props out to
Reese for the slamming tracks.  Tim, hope you enjoyed the ice water.
Peace to Chris from wherever if you headz are reading.

:)  i've only seen ss once, with warren g (louisville) and while he made me
go crazy as well, aphrodite just played more of what i want to hear when
i'm at a party...but the massive was a million more times into aphrodite at
FA than they were at the formation stop in louavul, and i'm sure that has
more that a little to do with it.

> I don't have any recollection of Paul
>Johnson going on before Aph.  I believe that was 1.8.7.  In fact, if Paul
>Johnson is the set I'm thinking of, I was none too impressed.

i'm 99% sure he spun right before aphrodite.  he went on almost exactly at
12mid.  right after halo.  if you were near the front/stage he would have
been a black guy in a wheelchair, probably with a baseball cap on and a
fair amount of jewelry, spinning chicago housey traxx and uplifting vocal
house.  hopefully some of that will jog your memory?  i know it wasn't joe
cuz i missed his set so he had to have played before 11.

>Also, I
>quite liked R Notorious J's set.

yeah, wish i had been there for it.  he rocked the house when i saw him in
dc, and i thought he was dj zinc til after his set.

>Number one clarification though, REBEL CREW ROCKED.  I haven't felt a
>better party vibe in quite a while.  Everyone was into it.  It was great!

well, glad SOMEBODY enjoyed it.  i really thought they ate a dick, and so
did most of my friends.  furthermore they kicked all the kids that were up
there dancing off the stage!  that's not very conducive to a "party vibe"
if you ask me...they came across more as concert performers and the only
part of the set i really liked was when they played "reckless".  someone
needs to dig up chris "the glove" taylor and have him spin at a party...;)

take two of these and thank me in the morning,

Actually Purrin Lion Sound Flex is out of Houston. Its made up of the following
individuals:

Lord Vishnu
DVS1
Roll DJ
BMC
React
ZZakaos
MC Gremlin
Vitamin A (San Antonio)
Joel Alamo (who is actually in Dallas)

They're an all jungle outfit who have been the largest supporters of jungle
in all of Texas and have pretty much been the major rise in the popularity
of the jungle in all of Texas.

Not to mention Lord Vishnu and Roll DJ are the best jungle DJs i've heard 
hands down...

hmm i figured out finally how to change the subject on a message but
this computer's delete key doesn't work in the address part & i'm not 
used to the "org" on the address so i keep having to start over. =\
anyway...speaking of bargains, i finally got a record bag & it is
fluorescent orange like i wanted. it cost only $20 & i found it at the
most unlikely place: the limited. of course i don't really shop there
but i was at the mall with my roomate & she was looking for a shirt
there. then i saw these record bags in orange, blue, or black. it has
a logo that says EXP like express or something. it's nylon & padded +
has 2 pockets + velcro to hold it shut + an adjustable strap. it's
average record bag size. anyway it's funny to find neat stuff like
this where you'd never expect to.

==================================================================
i'm 99% sure he spun right before aphrodite.  he went on almost exactly at
12mid.  right after halo.  if you were near the front/stage he would have
been a black guy in a wheelchair, probably with a baseball cap on and a
fair amount of jewelry, spinning chicago housey traxx and uplifting vocal
house.  hopefully some of that will jog your memory?  i know it wasn't joe
cuz i missed his set so he had to have played before 11.
====================================================================

i'm 99% sure michael is correct also since when i talked w/ titonton,
he said he went on @ 6pm & joe 1.8.7. went on right after him, which
would've been around 7pm not midnight for joe (feel free to speak up
joe)...the 1% is that i wasn't there, i didn't get to the party 'til
1am saturday night (got in for free, but missed alot of sets) and
titonton could've been lieing thru his teeth...but i really doubt it

=====================================================================
>Number one clarification though, REBEL CREW ROCKED.  I haven't felt a
>better party vibe in quite a while.  Everyone was into it.  It was great!

well, glad SOMEBODY enjoyed it.  i really thought they ate a dick, and so
did most of my friends.  furthermore they kicked all the kids that were up
there dancing off the stage!  that's not very conducive to a "party vibe"
if you ask me...they came across more as concert performers and the only
part of the set i really liked was when they played "reckless".  someone
needs to dig up chris "the glove" taylor and have him spin at a party...;)
======================================================================

i would again have to completely agree with michael, REBEL CREW blew
the big one...the best thing i had to say when hossam asked me what i
thought about them was: "uhm well i think it's supposed to be experimental
hip hop"...their vibe was equivalent to the MIDWEST AVENGERS vibe @
FA1...too full of themselves for any ravah to appreciate...it was sad
watchin so many kids just standing there whining about when they were
gonna get off

stephanie sed:
=======================================================================
quaint experience of putting water in a bottle, having it look clear, then
12 hours later looking at it again and noticing that it had turned rusty
red and cloudy?  My co-worker, a filtration expert, says that icky stuff
probably PRECIPITATED from the water.  YUCK!  Well, that's what you get
on a campground cheap enough to rent out for the entire weekend, I
suppose.
========================================================================

tee hee, i think i said it best when mint gave me his water bottle
during dub tribe: "i think you tried spiking some water with my dust!"

        Sometime in the distant future, (distant meaning like, next
summer), I've been thinking about trying to mix my own music... 
thus going out and buying record players, mixer etc....yesterday 
I happened to flipping through a copy of URB Magazine and I saw a 
large mixer with 2cd players attached...it said it had simulated 
'scratching' etc etc....I took notice to this cuz o\
I've been buying cd's for years (never thinking I'd mix on my own) 
and own no records.  Is this cd mixing any good? I'm just suspicious 
cuz I've never seen a live dj use one...so any help/comments/opinions 
you could give about this is much appreciated. :)

     The Purrin Lion crew is from Houston, TX and not Dallas and basically 
     Purrin Lion kicks ass :) . ..And they are cool peeps too.  Some of 
     their members are dj's Roll-DJ, DVS-1, Lord Vishnu, Joel Alamo, MC 
     Bill2 and a few others whose names escape me at the moment.  Joel 
     lives in Dallas-Fort Worth,
     
     ...and Dallas junglists are spreading the sound and causing a rawkus 
     as well!!!  Here we have the 32 degrees jungle crew which consists of 
     djs Mundo (thats me, rollin, dark, jumpup), Andrue (jump-up), 
     Heartbreak (moody future breakz), Squirt (jump-up), and Kong.  
     Phillip, Howell, Julie, and Amy organize our parties and we throw it 
     down Ruff! :)
     
     I've been on this list for 2 weeks and its been fun.  I was born and 
     grew up in Pittsburgh before moving to Dallas 9 years ago and the 
     peeps from Pittsburgh to Cleveland and throughout "The Valley" have 
     always been cool!!!  ...eventually I'll get back up there and meet 
     everyone at a big party :) Peace to da junglists!!!
     
     take Ohio River Blvd. North from Pittsburgh for 20 miles and you will 
     run into Beaver, Pa. - original home of future junglist!!!

Sorry for being an idiot, but I deleted the first public response to my
Purrin Lion question, the one from one of the HardCorps people.  Can you
write me back?  I'm interested in tapes if possible, and at least contact
info.  Thanks very much.

>when i talked w/ titonton,
>he said he went on @ 6pm

you know, did this upset anyone else???

i have no idea what brian (or whoever did the schedule) was thinking when
he decided to have t play at **6pm** (on one of the small stages no less??
or maybe he ended up playing the main stage, i dunno).  what type of
bullshit is that?  you have one of the most sought after up-and-coming
producers in techno (the buzz surrounding titonton both as a producer and
as a dj has noticeably grown over the past year...actually since around
io2) come to do a live PA at your party.  "yes please bring all your
expensive equipment out in this dry dust, okay?"  titonton took 2 weeks off
of work to prepare for this single performance.  he should have been given
a prime slot.  i'm sure i'm not the only one that feels this way.

i mean, c'mon, the rebel crew gets prime time for their dumb shit and t
gets stuck with 6pm???  *shakes head sorrowfully*

ah well...

take two of these and thank me in the morning,
michael

i agree....i've watched titonton rise from the early days at
ele_mental...and he has grown and improved. and the bump to 6pm is a bit of
a bitch job.....but on the selfish side, when i walked up there at 6:15 to
see what was up(draggin my tired ass from the tent : )...it was nice to
hear him on the set....i danced.and danced.repeat.
start telling people how good he is and let's get him headlining, or
support his releases...dig?

peace

Actually Purrin Lion Sound Flex is out of Houston. Its made up of the following 
individuals:
     
Lord Vishnu
DVS1
Roll DJ
BMC
React
ZZakaos
MC Gremlin
Vitamin A (San Antonio)
Joel Alamo (who is actually in Dallas)
     
They're an all jungle outfit who have been the largest supporters of jungle 
in all of Texas and have pretty much been the major rise in the popularity 
of the jungle in all of Texas.
     
Not to mention Lord Vishnu and Roll DJ are the best jungle DJs i've heard 
hands down...

BERLIN (July 13) - Snowploughs took to the sunny streets of Berlin on Sunday
to clear up a carpet of cans, bottles and clothing shed during the giant <A HR
EF="http://www.berlin030.de/day/parade/index.html">Love Parade</A> techno
music fest -- an event which drew up to one million revellers.

The city's sanitation department (BSR) said clean-up crews got off to a late
start removing up to 180 tons of garbage because massive crowds were still
packing the streets hours after Saturday's parade officially ended.

Despite threats by neo-Nazis and anarchist punks before the parade, police
said the event ran smoothly with no major disruptions and only 105 people
detained, most on charges of selling drugs or picking fights.

''It was a happy, boisterous Love Parade this year and took place without
disruption,'' a police spokeswoman said.

First-aid workers said they treated about 3,000 ravers for exhaustion,
dehydration and broken bones but reported no more serious injuries.

Young people from around the world who had descended on Berlin for the
weekend partied through the night under the Brandenburg Gate, down the
eight-lane parade route and even on the Potsdamer Platz, Europe's largest
construction site.

Many police officers seemed to catch ''rave fever'' too, as they danced along
with the thundering bass and synthesizer riffs of techno, had their faces
painted with hearts and sunflowers, and playfully exchanged water-gun fire
with the overheated crowds.

Police said the event had drawn about 500,000 ravers, but organizers insisted
Berlin had hosted about a million street dancers, beating last year's count
of 750,000 people.

Those out-of-town guests not still partying on Sunday in more than 130 techno
clubs which threw all-night bashes groggily made their way to packed train
and bus stations.

Techno music fans and those eager to see the spectacle which has exploded in
popularity since its modest beginnings in 1989, shortly before the fall of
the Berlin Wall, came from five continents for the city's ninth annual
parade.

Hundreds of people who had failed to book accommodation ahead of time camped
in the city's Tiergarten park which lines the parade route. Environmentalists
said the park looked like a ''battlefield,'' covered with rubbish and
exhausted ravers.

Although the BSP provided 672 toilets along the parade route, thousands
relieved themselves in the park, a fate environmentalists said was far worse
for the soil there than the mountains of garbage.

''We are spraying water above the trees to alleviate the 'over-fertilization'
of the Tiergarten this weekend,'' said a police officer supervising trucks
armed with water cannons which were inching their way down the boulevard.

Parade organizers had tried to initiate an outside ''urination ban'' to
prevent damage to the Tiergarten.

''The crews woke me up this morning at 9.30 a.m.,'' yawned Steffan, 25, a
raver in from Trebbin, south of Berlin. ''The hoses came through and drenched
us.''

Nature lovers had tried to re-route the Love Parade away from the Tiergarten,
saying the crush of people would do irreversible damage to the park's fragile
ecosystem.

Despite the garbage, disruption and noise, city officials have embraced the
Love Parade as a giant money maker for the cash-strapped city. Berlin expects
to rake in 150 million marks ($84 million) from the event.

But club owners prove to be the real winners at the festival, luring
thousands to continue their dance marathon into the night at a price of up to
50 marks a head, in addition to cashing in on sales from T-shirts, hats and
compact discs.

A group of disgruntled disc jockeys, frustrated with what they called the
main event's ''commercialism'' staged a rival ''Hate Parade'' in eastern
Berlin, but police said only about 1,000 attended and it fizzled out after a
few hours.

i'm a bit confused as to when T went on. i talked to him on friday night
during Snuggles & 3D and he told me that they wanted him to do his PA
at 6pm Sat night on the 3rd stage, but that he was going to do
everything in his power to get up on the main stage. i checked the
schedule and yup he was in the 6pm time slot on the 3rd stage. then i
talked to Colin on sat afternoon and he said that T told him his PA
would be at 6pm on the main stage...so we all hike up there around 6:30
or so, and Walt from columbus is spinning a house set as T sets up all his
gear. then after walt finishes up Jef from columbus starts his house set.
i left with the intention of coming back in 45 mins or so but didn't make
it back. i had people telling me he went on at 6pm and others saying later
at like 10:30 or something. so why doesn't someone who actually saw T's PA
speak up, because i'm confused :)

Don't even look at a Gemini..

Here is what will happen..

1.  You see cheap mixer with lots of stuff
2. you buy it..
3. works great for awhile
4. notice that the headphone levels aren't high enough
5. notice that the faders break in a month
6. crossfader dies.
7. the whole thing dies

You pay for what you get.. I mean if your going to go cheap get a NuMark,
you can bang them to hell, they  I have had my DMX-1000 for about 6 months
now, and about 3 crossfaders later, its still emitting sound.

btw, yes there are called denons and yes it is true that although this is
club-standard for mixing cd's, it really can't manipulate [at least on the
fly..with some good recording software, anything is possible] the music
like dj's [talented ones] can on the decks. IF one plan's on being like the
95% of monkeys that spin records to get honeys and just let them play while
they think of how smooth they look, a denon will suit you just fine, cuz
club girlies are a lot more horny. *lick* :P

i might have beeen wrong about radio stations though.. most radio dj's
willl spin directly for indivual cd players.. but i could be wrong.

has nobody mentioned pioneer's line in this conversation or did i delete the
wrong posts?  i've played with (not used, mind you, just tested) both and
thought the denon's were cheap crap i might consider if i were going to do
weddings and frats but would only settle for the pioneer system if i were going
to try to be a "real" dj, as it were.

at the radio stations i've worked at they always use individual transport
machines that are wired to a start switch on the board (incidentally, the
pioneer dj mixer has this feature as well if you use the pioneer cd players with
it).  Most used the Sony line because they are standard, reliable, and easy to
get parts/service for when they break...but they are not dj tools in the sense
that we are discussing here...they do have programming but not beatmatching.

waiting for somone to spew erroneous information,

Subject: {pb-cle} unity in pittsburgh... <-yah right. this post is *massive*
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

i didnt go to unity, but i was scheduled to play at the afterhours... what
a joke!~

this is the story of my weekend..as it happened..i think it demonstrates
the unpredictability of our scene, and how i cope with it. sorryin advance
for the karma dumping.

after i spent two-three weeks preparing for my first real live set ever, my
car's clutch gets wasted, and im left to find a ride to north park ice
skating rink with a huge ass keyboard, a computer and my gear.  thats just
a case of bad luck,so i shrugged it off. on friday night, of which i spent
waiting for phone calls, i get sick of than and go to the beehive to read,
and ended up talking to someone who i went to columbus with once and then
we went to Laga a couple minutes later. i dance there for a bit and check
out these really sexy girls that were dancing like they were doing
something else all freaky in their little groups of four and sometimes even
fifteen of these college kids thrusting their pelvises...this was earlier
in the night of course (10:30) and man i got sick of that real fast, (i
will admit it was enjoyable to watch them game on me for a bit ) anyway, i
find out theres a party on neville and i go to there to find out that the
afterhours to unity was scheduled to move to this guys house, which gave me
a sense of relief that i didnt have to go all the way to north park the
next day. i stayed here for a bit and saw a friend who happened to have his
KORG Trinity (*drool*) there with him, but we didnt get to play it cuz we
had to listen to techstep (*ick*) for three hours (we didnt have to, but we
waited eagerly to play some weird sounds and the guy who was playing the
records lived in the house..so we decided to go on a beer run in the
meantime) after gulping down a couple beers, the techstep seemed to sound a
little better. i suppose this is the stupidity factor of alcohol coming in
to play.
        anyway, no sign of any word from the unnamed organizer of the
afterhours in three weeks, apparently he had some business in detroit (who
i love to death but does this kind of thing before his parties). i found my
way home work on my music for the rest of the night/early morning..thinking
that the afterhours to unity is moved to this guys house which is cool, and
i exppected a ride from the same guy who had the KORG and was gonna let me
use it. he seemed pretty excited too.

saturday... sleep till 2pm.. finish up the final touches to my set and
practice it/record it. being satsfied enough i call the guy with the board.
he says hell meet me there. okay fine.. ride lost. try again.... nobody's
fucken going to this party!!  organizer doesnt respond to my pages. turns
out (as i found out on sunday morning when the door was locked to the "new"
afterhours location at 8am) that the afterparty to Unity was DURING Unity
itself?! what the fuck? can we say C-O-O-P-E-R-A-T-I-O-N?

okay granted i think that parties should be lowkey to an extent that it
should be hard enough to CARE to figure out whats going on about them/where
they are. etc.. but this is ridiculous.. i mean HELLO, can we give a fuck
about letting your guests know with consideration whats going on,
especially with a fairly small scale event not during normal raving hours?

sunday afternoon i basically selectively forgot about this whole fiasco
when i run into some cats who tell me the party is NOW moved to the
northside. hmmm ... me being the optimistic type, i got excited all over
again and ran back home to call the organizer to confirm a slot. he sed yah
come over as soon as posssible, i sed cool then he asks if i have any
speakers.. o:  AND get this: he asks if i can  " spread the word about this
a lil bit " (oh okay im a promoter again.. jeeez bring out the
blowpops).... hehe of course with the change in location this is
understandable, but hello.. why do you want a live pa again? if your
thinking "well why didnt pete just go to the party nevertheless and suck it
up?" ill tell you why. i cant fit my ammunition in a crate.that i can guard
at all times. why? cause i dont fucken buy it! i *make* it, and if im gonna
be treated with less consideration than an oakland sharp shooter who gets
smoked up to enjoy jungle cuz it just doesnt sound right sober, whats the
point.? id rather sit home and do my laundary over and over again cuz it
smells better.

alright bitch mode off we seem to say.

i dont know about you guys, but im excited for Bounce.. finally a decent
lineup, an honest promoter who doest associate primarily with the major
rave caves in pittsburgh, and some phat tunes that will make kids want to
stay and enjoy a new venue. much preliminary props for advertising
correctly. should be slammin' not to much jungle, not too much house..
woohoo!! a promoter that recognizes moderation :D


good day *nod*

I am so hype for Bounce!  A bunch of my friends from D.C. are coming in to
check it out.  The line-up is phat too, which is something I think Pgh
needs right now.  I just hope they keep the tech-step on the minimum.  I
mean its fine for a while, but that gets on your nerves after a while-
especially if youre not high.  

Im looking forward to Steel City too.  A tag team and some old school!

They are?  I'll admit, I havn't been in the booth in a lot of clubs, but 
all I've seen are standard decks, not unlike my G:M900's.

Very true.  Though I have had some success with setting loops on the fly 
with the segment repeat option.

But who knows where they've been? :)

Forget the girlies when you're spinning.  The music should be enough.

Magick first.  Females second.

Only in this case.  I use CDs as supplements to a set, not as the set 
itself.

I'll take your word for it.  Morse code is not an alphabet I'm familiar with.

:)  I'm pretty sure there'll be no techstep @ Bounce -> DCypol will be

	Went into a new store called Guitar Center today.  It's right
by Great Northeren Mall in North Olmstead where the old Fretters
used to be.  Turns out the place is *packed* full of stuff to play with
besides guitars.  Drum and effex machines, keyboards, synths, speakers,
lighting effects, and even a few turntables and mixers set up.  Best of
all you're encouraged to play with everything.  Fun for types
like me who don't get out much..;)

I went, the party seemed pretty lame...I really liked the lighting
setup, but the floor was pretty empty...the search at the door was
ridiculous..checked my pager, inside my hat, etc, etc...surprised we
didn't have to strip...gawd...

One thing I noticed that I thought was really really shady was the sign
they had on the table at the end of the night that said "VG productions
lost 4500 on this event, help out with donations" or something to that
effect...It was in color and on nice quality large size paper, looked
like it was printed proffesionaly, with a laser printer..definatly made
before the party, seeing as direx for the after party were scrawled on
cardboard with a marker...I hope they hadn't actually *planned* on
loosing money... ;)

O.K., I've just finished up in the studio this week-end.  The process is
finished!!!  Dum Dum Ta Da (*Big Fanfare, drum rolls, trumpets blare*)...
Now, the last thing I need to do is make some cassette copies off of the
DAT.  Ryu, if you'd like to volunteer your CDR for CDs, that would be
great.  If people would like some tapes, e-mail me and I'll bring some to
"Hard Up" with me on Friday.  I'd try to make some for SteelCityJungle,
but don't think I'll be able to make enough copies in time.  I'm going to
ge the tape order to Michael so he can get started on the J-Cards.  Alzo,
the RealAudio version of the tape should be finished by the end of the
week.

um, i always though that a cd r was the only thing that could read a
recorded cd... something abt how regular cd players and cd roms read data
of the disk is different from how cd r's are written (although most cd r's
can read regular disks)

this being the case... (if it is the case anyway...) how do u propose to
help out w\ your cd r... its a noble jesture, but useless to most of us i
believe... 

i'm having a vision...

cd r disks are reletively expensive... i dont supposed you'll dub them for
free... so i send u my money... and u send me a disk...... and it sits
there collecting dust... and i'm wondering where my money went....

... ok now back to reality.

ok....i know this is none of my business, but having used numerous DAT
systems, cdr's and even recordable mini-discs for MASTERING recordings (as
was offered).....i would use a cdr or mini-disc any day over DAT, even
recording dat tracks to ths cdr or mini-disc....because then it becomes a
one machine process for placement, replacement, or even all out
remastering!!!!!
so what i'm saying, is that if Tea is willing to volunteer the use of his
cdr.......well....maybe you should get your mind out of yur wallet, back in
the music, and say thank you........(after the master is on cdr...you can
always bounce it down to DAt or even analog recording, if you are
concernedas to what you'll do with a cdr)
then again, if i'm wrong, and tea's just trying to make a buck off of your
work.....then shame on Tea...and shame on me for stickin' my nose in....
later

Regular cd players will read "cd r" discs.  If cd roms and disc players
couldn't read them, there'd be no use for them.  

I'll take my comp the cheap way.

CD-R is a CD burner, and it can burn both CD-ROMs and audio CDs, which
can then be read by any player of the appropriate type. Regular CDs and
data CDs are different, a CD-ROM can usually read both, and a CD-R can
burn both.

Brian and other Clevelanders,

On the East Side on Mayfield in "The Greens of Lynhurst" shopping strip
there is a Sam Ash music store.  Same thing with regard to playing with
excellent techno gear.  They have some great synths, drum machines, bass
line machines and controllers.  

Braden

P.S.  Anyone going out on Wednesday?  Eu4ia?  Brillo Pad?  Both?

Guitar has alot of neat toys and you can spend hours there.  We've had
one in Dallas for at least five years now.  I've bought everything from
PA gear(which are in Pittsburgh right now) to tone generators there and
have a couple words of caution.  To start the service there usually
sucks, occasionally you'll find a nice salesman who knows his shit. 
Another important thing is don't fall for their blow out sales!  You'll
find out that every month they have these so called "blow out" sales and
you can usually get the sames prices when there not having the sale. 
Occasionally they have a couple of awesome deals at these sales, but
usually their pretty average.
smile on,
Johnny

Not sure how the confusion for this thread started, but Eric wrapped it up
nicely.  The issue is not mastering, I've already done that with a DAT
tape.  Basically, half of the submissions were on audio cassette, so I
EQ'd them a little, and the rest were on DAT.  I balanced all of the
volume levels as good as I could and then arranged the tracks into some
kind of order: starting from 1.8.7's (the original PB-CLE list admin)
technical Drum 'n Bass, through Ryu's hardcore, to Send Break's Jump-Up
Jungle, to Cedrick Flupp's breakbeat, to Trout Soup's hard tekno, to Scoop's
electronica, to Johnny Finger's Latin House, ending at Pete Sisko's 
trance. The finished comp works out to nearly 60 minutes of original 
electronic music!!

Anyways, I was suggesting that if the subitting artists want to give Ryu
money for CDs (probably about $10 per CD), and if he wants to do the work,
some of us can get some CDs of the comp. The quality is quite good
overall.  Anyone else who is interested can get a copy of the tape either
by sending me a couple of bucks for copying/shipping, or send a SASE
envelope with a 60 minute tape in it and I'll dub a copy for ya.  I agreed
to make cassette copies for all of the artists involved, and will send
them out this week or next, but anyone else in PB-CLE land who wants a
copy should just contact me, or copy the tape from one of the artists, or 
listen to the RealAudio file on PB-CLE's homepage as soon as Jamie and I 
work that out. 

Is that cool with everyone?  So, I guess contact Ryu for a CD and me for 
a tape, or hyperreal for a RealAudio stream...

Wink won't be at U4Ia for quite a while. But it's not the clubs fault,
Josh's schedule is very tight right now, so Josh told the club that he
would come back as soon as he could, this could be a few weeks or months
away. But he will come , he feels really bad about missing the night.

Subject: {pb-cle} My CdR.
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

ok, sorry 'bout all the confusion.

my name is Ryu.  i live outside pittsburgh.  i own a cdR.
i wrote in to let Tea know that i would like to offer it
for the pb-cle compilation.  not for mastering, but in case
someone would want a cd version of the tape.  a cdR can
burn regular audio cds to play in ANY cd player.  they are 
exactly like any other cd you'd buy except that they are 
green instead of silver.  the cost of a blank cdR is about
$8.00.  once i get a copy of the compilation, i will be more
than happy to burn off cd versions of it for $9.00 to anyone
who is interested.  the extra dollar will cover shipping.
i am not trying to make any money off this at all, and that
comment was not only eroneous, but ludicrous as well [viva
la mike tyson!]

so, in conclusion, email me to get a cd copy of the comp.
then i'll give you my address and that.

thanks,
love,
ryu

michael sed:
==================================================================
i have no idea what brian (or whoever did the schedule) was thinking when
he decided to have t play at **6pm** (on one of the small stages no less??
or maybe he ended up playing the main stage, i dunno).  what type of
bullshit is that?  you have one of the most sought after up-and-coming
producers in techno (the buzz surrounding titonton both as a producer and
as a dj has noticeably grown over the past year...actually since around
io2) come to do a live PA at your party.  "yes please bring all your
expensive equipment out in this dry dust, okay?"  titonton took 2 weeks off
of work to prepare for this single performance.  he should have been given
a prime slot.  i'm sure i'm not the only one that feels this way.

i mean, c'mon, the rebel crew gets prime time for their dumb shit and t
gets stuck with 6pm???  *shakes head sorrowfully*
====================================================================

personally i would've prefered hearing titonton play in place of rebel
crew, but i'm pretty sure the rebel crew were given the prime spot 
because they are a part of I and I musique, the UPS record label, and
of course u want to get your people heard first...another reason may
be the rebel crew is considered more of a 'live act' with multiple
performers where as titonton was just up there by himself with just
his gear...the final reason may be because rebel crew is from houston,
texas and can't be seen as often as titonton, who is a pretty local
dj for this area

there were quite a few dj's 'dissed' at the event...i know ian mariano
was supposed to spin at the jericho tent, but was never given the 
oppurtunity, where as jeff & zona got to spin main stage...this seemed
equally ridiculous to me because i know ian's got ten times more skills
than both jeff & zona put together...but this may have to do with the
fact that jeff & zona were on the original line-up...i know there are
other reasons for the other line-up disputes...some of them run pretty
deep and can't really be discussed in an open forum such as this...
politics...politics...bullshit...the only way to win is not to play...

New Mixtape

"Just for You" by KPAKPO on Bulletproof Recordings.

Another wicked release from the Substitution camp. This is 60 minutes of
no-nonsense jungle with Kpakpo's well-loved dark edged bounce.  Kicking
off with a nod to the early '95 style, it rides seamlessly through
everything from the hype to the moody.  Watch out for some heavily soulful
exclusive remixes.  Serious business.


For more information and track listing contact Bulletproof at 412-521-7844
or Substitution at 215-618-1501. E-mail for Track listing.

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Sorry about this large crosspost.

I am putting out two new mixes right now:

dd11 - "I'm Dripping" - Sultry deep house.  if you're familiar with the
music i select, you won't be surprised by the following adjectives:  warm,
soulful, loungey, vibey house.  an almost completely instrumental journey
into true creativity, beats, melody and jazz.  mixed completely live in nyc
with all brand new music from around the world, 100% vinyl (of course).

dd12 - "Perils of Wisdom" - hard bangin minimal flightey complex pattern
induced crossfaded EQed 140s techno mayhem, from the pits of anger,
inspiration and depression.  all new, only high quality *true purist*
techno mainly from europe.  Good techno is becoming harder and harder to
find these days, but enough good shit from the past couple of months was
squeezed into these 90mins.

all tapes were duplicated off a digital source (dat) onto high-grade chrome
BASF 92minute cassettes.  full color jcard art and lables.  $10 a tape,
mailorder or in person.  contact ddrazen@liii.com for more info.

i'll be in london for the first two weeks in august, so try not to order
anything within that timeframe.

Even though i missed FAIII which i'm so mad about, some of my other "peers"
 went.  They are actually a bunch of druggies who could care less about the
music because they are the basic white trash Metallica shirt wearing losers
(no offense to anyone who fits this description and is reading this).  But
what made me so mad is that they went to FAIII and they have been to alot of
raves.  They just like to go to them for the wide range of drugs they can
buy.  I was talking to one and he was talking about these drugs he bought at
a "hippie fest" at bear creek.  That just made me mad because this kinda
trash is degrading what a rave is all about.  It made me sick.

Just thought that had to be said
Peace and chicken grease,
Matthew

hey...i understand that people that don't get into the scene, look
different and etc seem to bring you down. I even know from first hand
experience how a group of people just lookin' for drugs can blow a party's
vibe........but let's not get away from what it's all about........remember
the first time someone (girlfriend, biyfriend, friend, enemy, congressman)
dragged you to a party?? i fell in love with it at once, but not everyone
does. maybe they'll pick up on the vibe.....who knows???
i know you are sad you missed FA3...it was fun : )......and you feel like
punching someone who went and didn't how lucky they were.......but if you
callled them "friends" maybe you can bring them over to our frame of mind.
they are already going for the drugs....its not too hard to make them start
going for the love....trust me...i used to go for the drugs......that was 5
years ago...and i haven't done any drugs the last 3 parties i have went to
(of course that's mainly 'cause everyone tried to push crystal at
me....what's up with that poison?)....oh shit....i just realized how much
rambling is going on.....to wrap it up

don't segregate or snub....it's about unconditional love....not
style.....dig?

Nicely put.......the clothes alone show an obvious clash with the overall
vibe of the scene....but really, when you think about it, raves and parties
have the nasty drug association going for them..or rather going against them
that attracts these ones.  
   I dont know about the rest of you, but I find myself so engrossed in the
music and dancing and the vibe that eminates from THAT, that  the looser
white trash as you put it doesnt even exist in my world.  I think for many
this experience is a meditation....a clear your mind and explore type
venture.  The minute you let others dictate where you go on your personal
"trip" (no pun intended), you have given away too much of your energy to
something that you cant anything about anyway. I used to get pissed that
people didnt dress up (even in old skool raver gear) just to show their
appreciation and give more to the asthetics of the party....but then it
occured to me....the majority of people dont give a rats ass....so why should
I.   Its hard to ignore the blatent disrespect shown by sooo many. 
   But heres a suggestion, this is what I do so I dont gt irked and dont have
to be affected by the looser glurpie ass drugged out vibe........close your
eyes and feel the music and when you open them remember you only see the
beautiful people (vibe wise) and see the pretty lights that softly guide you
through the experience (even if its a blacklite over the DJ booth)....the
rest doesnt exist...this is your time.......NO ONE CAN INVADE

on the messages below....
ok...it's all a personal trip  and believe me...i worry about what clothes
I'M wearing more than a drag queen on her big night!!!....but damn!!....i
guess the scene has degenerated into a kids club fashion show.....how can
you say "beautiful people VIBE wise" and then say that someones clothes put
them apart?????
"blatent disrespect???"" for not dressing like "one of us"
yo you kids need to break out your dictionary...somewhere you got
"unconditional love" and "regardless of race, creed, appearance, etc"
confused with "if the don't look like me then they are wrong.".....that's
too bad..
do you know what this whole "party" thing is about???
and i'm not trying to flame....your right....go and get into the music and
do your own thing.....i couldn't agree more....but i am soooo fed up with
the discrimination......i wear my gear cause i like it and it's soooo dope
i have no choice.....but i'll hang out with anyone...dig?.......the scene
ain't high school (or it's not supposed to be)
and people ask me why i only go to out-of-state parties anymore.....
peace

In a message dated 97-07-18 14:00:28 EDT, you write:

<< ..how can
 you say "beautiful people VIBE wise" and then say that someones clothes put
 them apart????? >>

I think I need to clarify........When the original message stated a
stereotype  "they are the basic white trash Metallica shirt wearing losers"
what I was commenting on was the attitude that accompanies such ones....they
are "not beautiful" due to the energy the typically put out.  I dont give a
flying purple twinkie if they are in clad in their Verso jacket and
Airwalks.....if they arent bringing peace, harmony, and love to the scene
they are looser trash.

<<i wear my gear cause i like it and it's soooo dope
i have no choice.....but i'll hang out with anyone...dig?.......the scene
ain't high school (or it's not supposed to be)
and people ask me why i only go to out-of-state parties anymore.....>>

More power to you..........wear what you want........I love my raver gear
too........and yah I  will hang with anyone whos not screwing with the
vibe....but my fun WILL not be based on others. Clothed or naked for all I
care ....youre right its not high school.....I graduated too many years ago
to deal with that crap.

As for out of state parties..um i have been in enough states and scenes to
see that there is no difference........there is love and F**** uped energy no
matter where you go.......I always thought it might be nice for all those who
complain about the scene where they live to maybe, instead of going elsewhere
bring their good vibe to their hometown..........."give peace a chance"

yada yada yada.

the fact that there is this much discussion about what keeps you/us from being
naked shows that you care too much already.

what this scene needs is a good old-fashioned NUDITY REQUIRED FOR
ADMISSION party. nothing else will bring us together so well.

so really, if my shirt says plus 8 or 8 bark, if you're reading it you're
obviously not facing the speaker.

shut the fuck up and dance, remember?  vibe my ass.

	August 1st weekend          THE LAND OF MAKE-BELIEVE
Erie, PA


	Liquid Sound Distortion Productions would like to create a
moment in time this summer that you 
	will remember for the rest of your life.....


Featuring

LIVE Performances by:

	* Vapourspace (a.k.a. Mark Gage) - FFRR, Polygram Records

	The man who brought us the "Gravitational Arch of 10" anthem
with his first album back in '92. Gearing up for a new album release
coming up this fall, Mark was kind enough to make Erie the first place
to perform his new material LIVE. We would also have the opportunity to
hear his DJ set that he has been famous for while touring all over
Europe with the likes or Orbital, the Orb, and Aphex Twin. 
	 
	* DV8 - Analog Foundation Frontier - 45 Caliber Records

	If you missed his exclusive live performance at the World
Electronic Music Festival (WEMF) in Canada last week, make sure you
don't miss it again. The wicked ear pleasing mix of hard trance and
techno will please you in every way. John has been on the forefront of
the techno music sounds for over 10 years now. An Upstate NY favorite,
and a DESTINY resident in Toronto. A Bonus DJ set is in store too.

	 * Hesohi  - UPS

	Funky house from the technician who has greeted us with his
presence before. Lay back, relax, and enjoy.


DECK TECHNICIANS:

	* Frankie Bones - Sonic Groove, NYC

	The East Coast originator making his first performance in this
area. Don't miss his talent and ability to perform 	flawlessly.

	* Hardware - Adrenalin Records, West Palm Beach 
	
	Todd has released more albums and mixed CD's in a year, that
most rock groups release in their lifetime. 	Coming off his delirium
creating performance at WEMF, he will give you a full dose of trance and
hard breaks. 

	* DJ Funk - Dance Mania, Chicago 		

	The booty house ghetto-master in coming to bring the house down.
Don't get offended by the lyrics in his tracks. 	It's there just
for your pure pleasure and to enhance your dancing experience.

	* Osheen - Sorted, Nervous, Strictly Rhythm, Blinded Records,
Boston 

	Back by popular demand, the house guru who ripped it up at 'The
Search for MR. Yamma' is bringing some more. 	Are YOU Ready?

		* J. Goodwill - God's House Inc., NYC

		Hard House to take everyone into frenzy. He's been
looking forward to this for over 6 month now, and hopes that 	everyone
else has too.

		* Odi - Digital Konfusion Krew, NYC

	The scratchmaster extraordinaire is coming here. Probably the
most in demand jungle DJ over the last few months 	is taking some
time off his busy schedule to greet us with his performance. 

MIDWEST Crew:

	*Wilhelm K - COK, Indy
	*Locotus - Indy
	*Joe Kidd - Hometeam, Akron
	*Dishboy - Cleveland

And the Local CLOWNS:

	*DJ E
	*Matrix 
	*Crossover
	*Charles Alexander
	
More DJ's will be there - TBA at the party.	


	The party is August 1st and 2nd. The main acts are performing on
Friday, August 1st, with Saturday night being reserved for more
local/area talent. 

	$10 in advance (going on sale on Friday, July 18) and $15 at the
door.  
	 
Only 250 presale tickets distributed in Erie, Cleveland, Pittsburgh,
Buffalo and Rochester.

	For more information please dial 1-800-991-5301 or (814)
455-9171 (to speak to someone Live)

yeap, the rumors are true--T will be spinning a hard-ass jungle/drum&bass
set on the second stage in the mid-to-late afternoon here at the columbus
LOLLAPALOOZA show this sunday at polaris amphitheater. 

oh and in case anyone out there didn't know about this, there is a nice
T-approved biography on the ele_mental site; everything you'd ever want to
know about where he comes from and what he's trying to do.

heh. thanks but does anybody have the infoline????
a friend of a friend is doing their sound and is somewhat clueless;
meaning if he doesnt get more information he will probably go under the
assumption that it will be at  the alleyway near the cardello building; an
assumption i have made wrong about a party i was going to play at last
year, Ortho. so if anyone can reply fast, twill be rewarded in heaven.

peace.

You know what, the whole Lullabyepalooza tour this year can suck a fat one!
 Went to the show, no Tricky, no Prodigy, no Orb, no Orbital, no Orbit, shit,
their werent any Orbs at all, no Failure, no Blues Explosion, no nothing,
just a bunch of drunk Frat boys shakin their tousches to played Snoop and
Devo...  I saw four ravers, two were DJ's, thanks for coming Sine and Tim....
 Im thinking of sueing for false advertising, seriously, if I would have paid
for my ticket, Id be really pissed...  Afterthought, one of the 2nd stage
bands, not too bad, called Summercamp, said "we heard Pittsburgh loves rock
and roll..."   I thought, "You'd think, by this Fucked up line up." 
There were a lot of very disappointed people in the crowd.
Did Prodigy, Tricky, or the Orb go to any other cities?
Did anyone notice that Perry Farrell's all day all night festival/rave with
Lady Kier got cancelled last summer in Pittsburgh, heard Philly was awesome..
Cant wait to leave this washed up WDVE town.

Subject: {pb-cle} Hard Up Review
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,

        This is my first review of a party, but I don't think it will be too
tough to review HARD UP because it STRAIGHT UP was a big goddammned joke.
Here's how it went.  
        I got off work at about seven thirty to hurry home and find that my
boy Ike had called just as excited that we could see Saint, Grrrl 13 (is
that the right amount of R's?), and Farmer Tea do their thangs for a mere
five dollars.  Ike picked me up at about a quarter after nine, and we
arrived at the Brewhouse about an hour later.  First of all, we saw this
shady promoter of some punk shows at the door.  That didn't make us too
happy because of how he has treated folks in the past, like at the Queers
show he started throwing people out and wack shit like that, but I don't
know the whole story.  Oh, and there was one more thing that really pissed
me off, there was no music at the time.  
        We ventured further into the building to be quite pleased with the
setup, clean, really neat looking, and it had an Atari.  Then I saw the
crowd.  They were a bunch of frat boys and drunks.  It was very sad.  
        They started some allright stuff, I forget who it was, because the
schedule was really different from the one thay posted.  Oh well.  No one at
all was dancing, and it was so hot that I thought I was gonna die in there.
So, I just walked around for a bit and tried to talk to some people and play
the atari.  I was interrupted by some woman wearing a yellow dress, who
encouraged people to come and tell yo' mama jokes.  This lasted twenty
minutes.  It was also very sad.  
        The music went back on for a little bit, but it was far too hot to
dance.  That and the fact that everyone was walking around with bottles of
beer. It was also, as I have said before, very sad.  
        Less than an hour later, some guy went up and said he was a
performance artist.  He really was horrible.  He wanted us to applaud for
several stupid things he could do for us.  They included fucking a
watermelon. He got the largest response from that one, but he would not do
it, fortunately for me.  He ended up trying to smash stuff.  He had really
bad aim though.  Some drunk guy, like the other guy wasn't, came up and did
a better job.  I was close to tears at this point, that's how sad it was.  
        After they cleaned up, some o.r.i. revo stuff started and i just
left, and anyway I had to work the next day.  Maybe I should have stayed for
a little bit longer to see Saint, but I had seen enough.  I went to Eat n'
Park and had a better time.  Hell, I had a better time at work, and that
says a whole helluva lot in itself.  By the way, speaking of work, I work at
North Park Swimming pool, and if I'm in the booth I'll try and hook you up
wiht free admission when you mention that you're on the list.  I'm the
skinny short blonde kid.  
        Sorry to be so negative, but I am just speaking honestly.  I don't
think I'm asking for stupid shit to have music playing the whole time.
Hell, that's why I went, so please don't flame my ass, but if you do, expect
a retort.  To anyone else, I hope my next review will be mor optomistic, and
anyway tell me how I did.  Oh, and to Trouty, I think this is our version of
the California frat boyz party.  You win some, you lose some.  

"Forecast for tonight: dark."

well...orbital and prodigy were never scheduled to play at lolla in
pittsburgh...and i don't think the orb was ever associated with
lolla...i'm under the impression they're touring on their own...

anyways...how can you complain about the frat boys? what did you expect?
some sort of tribal gathering? this is LOLLAPALOOZA for god's sake...i'm
surprised you actually had positive expectations of this thing...

on another note...any portishead fans out there heading for their
concert in NYC this thursday?

The only person that was advertised that didn't show up was Tricky.  The 
Orb, Orbtal, and the Prodgy were scheduled for different dates.

That was a bitch!  That was going to be awesome . . . but I saw on MTV 
that there is going to be a big ass tour "electronica" tour that would be 
around . . . whether or not it comes to Pittburgh is another story.

Though I must say the Prodigy tore the roof off, (completely putting to shame all the so-called rock-n-roll bands) I do have to ask, have they completely disowned "Experience"?  No Charly, no Wind it Up, no Jericho.  Was up wit dat?  Well anyhow, no complaints here.  They were incredible, well worth the five plus years it took for me to finally be in the right place at the right time.  Not all of us can live in the U.K.

One other thing...

Where was Tricky?

        I just got this review from guy on the mw-list.  I had asked that
if I were 30-45mins late for the show, how much would I miss. He
ended up anwsering my question and gave me a review that's got me
so EXCITED to see them tonight! So I thought other Clevelanders
heading out tonight would enjoy it too.....
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
it495,   Have no fear, The orb in St. Louis didn't come on until about 10 pm,
but we had a DJ, (Astroboy) and another producer-group open for them here.
   Allow 45 min per opener and 20 min in between each one.

IN SAINT LOUIS.

I am a lover of ambient trance.  FSOL, Orb, Download, Aphex Twin, etc..   I
am an IDM freak.     I was so incredibly stoked about the orb I would've
given a kidney to see them...   As long as I've been listening I've always
wondered what they looked like.  I've seen no pix of them (no matter how hard
I tried to find them in diff. albums, singles, zines, and websites) so I was
ready to break the mystique and see them.  I assumed they looked like angels,
it being my firm belief that God Himself is an orb fan, and was only slightly
dissapointed when I saw them.  (I must say though that upon seeing Cobain and
Dougans from FSOL and Richard James from Aphex, I can't say I was entirely
satisfyed with their appearance).   Anyway.  They opened with what I think
was Lil' fluffy clouds and proceded to go into the most phantasmagorical
(what a dumb-shit word) production I've ever seen.   I've been to a lot of
raves and seen lots of DJs and a few producers, BUT NEVER have I seen the
quanity and quality of equipment that towered around them (I actually climbed
the pillar in the Galaxy to get a view of one of them...  I sort of felt like
Zachieus or Zacharius or whoever it was climbing the tree to see Jesus as he
walked by).  ((I wonder if the equipment was stacked so high so as to
continue the mystique... hmmm.))  They eventually went into one of the
bassyist rendition of towers of dub that I ever thought imaginable.   The
quality of that equipment to not blow out the speaker cones escapes me.  It
actually vibrated the stage enough to tip over a cup with 1" of water, ice,
and cigarette butts.   Oddly enough, despite my passionate love of dancing, I
couldn't dance and was even mildly resentful of those who were.  The amount
of energy being sent at me from their music was not something I wanted to
waste by showing off my limited dance abilities.  I just stood there and
drooled.   During Blue Room I had multiple orgasms.   I shit you not.....
  well maybe I shit you a little, but not too much.     St. Louis's finest
showed up:  Astroboy opened (but I missed it because I was workin'),
 Tantalizer was there and was dancin,  DJ Norse was there and I'm sure a
zillion others were there too.   Oh, and one last thing....   Beware of the
encore/finale.....   It'll blow your freakin' mind......

That's it.   Joy, Peace, and Love

I just saw them in Pontiac last night.  The doors opened at about 8:15
and the
first act, I think it was Sun Electric but don't quote me of this
started at
about 9:30.  Orb finally hit the stage at about 11:30.  If they have the
same
doors open, 8:00,  I would expect Orb to start playing at 11:00 at the
earliest.

You know, I totally agree with you on most points.  Its so important that
we try to accept everyone and be open minded.  I also agree that its okay
to wear high profile labels if thats the kind of thing one likes.  I,
however, do not agree on the "out-of-state parties" point.  This is a big
problem that completely transcends our area. This is everyone's problem.
The scene is opening up to new people, but at the same time its loosing
the personal appeal.  Going to a party in a different place isnt always
the solution.
  I, personally, think that supporting your own area as well
as others is the only way things can get any better.  Just having lots of
cool, laid back people to meet at a party makes it twice as nice.  
Thats just my 2 cents.

yes, the renegade on saturday was under the west end bridge and was a whole
lotta fun. i wish it was promoted a lil bit more tho (attendance est. 50
people), cuz this kid Smalls from DC fukin cut shit up, and it was the
first time i heard glen (loki) spin in awhile and hes gotten a lot better.
dcypol's set was allright but the mood wasnt right for happy hardcore.
scott( i forget his dj name) spun a very good set of progressive trance
after him, followed by product 19 but i didnt stay that long. the sound was
in the back of a truck and was loud enough but not bassy enough. next time
i think the location will be somewhere where you dont have to dance on
gravel. look for more renegades in the following weeks and look for flyers
for them at Bounce, and maybe on this list. rumor is theres one three weeks
from now. bye.

aphex twin probably has a 2 channel mixer and a computer becuase he doesnt
want to deal with pressing records for stuff that he has made. he gets paid
a lot too and doesnt want to fuck up. with average joe dj, the stuff that
happens on records that is unrehearsed (what usually makes a memorable set)
wont happen the same way on denons.
========
as for the foward moving attitude part, i dont neccessarily see any more
advanced technology at raves that i do at the supermarket. the cashier
operates a laser scan thingy that wiggles, they have lots of florescent
lights, sell lots of consumables, and have microphones and modems. they
wear velcro and denim too. the food gallery in east liberty even has cops
at it. some shoppers even have automatic go-carts. thats something raves
dont usually have. the point is technology and advanced machines are
everywhere and i dont think theyre concentrated to more of an extent in the
rave scene than in the rest of the community. its definately an economic
boundary.

the buddha, the godhead [the key to the universe or whatever], lies just as
comfortably in gears of a motorcycle than it does the petals of a flower.
lets say that the motorcycle can kill the flower but the flower cant kill
the motorcycle; does that make the motorcycle have a more foward moving
attitude?
or does the foreward moving attitude imply that we can predict and are
ready for the future's sophisticated systems and machines? i frankly
couldnt say that we as ravers are anymore ready than the next guy. maybe
techno's foward attitude that you speak of isnt foward at all, but inward.
technology is letting people go inward more, examining themselves by
avoiding a common objective reality, and most ravers have a sense of pride
in being unleashed within the realm of the self.  major themes in techno
music are about the future (foward in time), but thats probably because
techno is our music, and we are young.

music and dancing ....     is what we have in common...    goes foward, but
so does time (does it?). to some people doing a lot of physical activity is
a way to get in shape and stuff (foward thinking), but the majority of
people you dance with at parties are there to enjoy it, not move foward
into any such information age that the common idiot can't figure out yet.
the information age is already here and its attitude is simple to
understand:: its just another way to be more sophisticated, lazier and have
more toys than the next guy. techno is a apart of this age, but not
neccessairly this attitude. some people think making better techno is
easier when you use more sophisitcated gear, but its about knowing your
machine(s). if you know more about filters than about effects parameters,
an analog instrument would suit you better than a digital one. how do you
learn these things? you tweak them.

i can dig it, but without knobs i dont think we would have the word "tweak"
and without the word tweak, man i dont know, man....what attracts me to it
is that::
-tweaking is art of testing boundaries.
-tweaking is learning; and most of the time,

thats all.

yes i think you are right about the unrehearsed stuff.  spontanaity (sp?)
is one of the things that makes live performances worthwhile.
but that doesn't mean that you can't do unrehearsed things with a digital
setup.  aphex don't use analogues anymore because [he says anyways] that
he can do more with digital.   that was probably a bad example because
he is definitely not "joe dj".  he makes his own software and implements
it on the fly live.

>as for the foward moving attitude part, i dont neccessarily see any more
>advanced technology at raves that i do at the supermarket.

i know.  and that is my point.
i'm not saying that there SHOULD be more technology at raves.  in fact, i
personally HATE modern technology, and would do anything to be comfortable
playing with some flint and a few twigs all day.  my point was, that i can't
understand why the rave scene is still so attached to using turntables at
raves all the while the music is organized with computers, processed with
computers, recorded with computers, and distributed with computers.

i agree with you.  when i was refering to the whole "forward moving"
attitude of the rave scene, i was referring to the way the music broke
away from the days of acoustic music.  you have to admit, that the scene
really got off on the whole "i love future stuff" mentality.  i mean, the
glitter, the neon and metalic colored clothes, the lasers, the big
rotating audio, the glowsticks, the alien fashions, etc...etc...

no becuase regardless of what happens to either of them, they will
always be in the same place.  

>or does the foreward moving attitude imply that we can predict and are

no.  it's what we THINK the future is going to be like that we immitate.
and 9 times out of 10 we are right.  the self-fulfilling prophesy.

i'd say that if anything, today, ravers are looking outward more than inward.
100000%!!!!!   that is why i say that the music is lacking today.  the artists
are too caught up in doing something that hasn't been done before, and most
of them overlook what they are really feeling and never let it out in the
music.  most techno i hear today is very impersonal, and detached of 
any sense of the self.  

>major themes in techno
>music are about the future (foward in time), but thats probably because
>techno is our music, and we are young.

yes, you are right.  and to get back on track then....if we are young,
why do we spin records on record players that are old?
that is my question.  

>music and dancing ....     is what we have in common...    goes foward, but
>so does time (does it?). 

time goes nowhere.

you can do everything you could do with any old moog with something like
a trinity and way more on top of that.  it may not sound EXACTLY the same, 
but i am not one to sit down and analyze frequencies.  i'd rather pay
attention to what the ARTIST is trying to say with the music than how he 
or she says it.

yes, tweaking is great.  and almost every piece of gear that has been 
released in the last year has had knobs on it because people want to tweak
and they want their digital sounds too.....so the suits and ties finally
started paying attention, and they have been giving us the best of both
worlds.

Fellas,

        Sorry to interrupt this argument, but as I read everything you had
to say, I noticed you left out one thing.  If this change would occur from
records to all that high tech jazz, I'm barely familliar with, we're going
to lose stuff like scratching.  That's one of my favorite things to watch a
dj do, scratch.  There will be nothing to scratch if we use digital stuff.
Sure, you can repeat it and interrupt it and run it back time after time,
but something of the art of the thing is lost.  
        Here's another thought.  Back in the day there were no computers,
there was no electricity.  Music was an artform.  Even now that we have
these keyboards that can perfectly match almost any musical instrument, we
would still rather see or hear a person play that particular instrument.
Really, would you rather watch a concert violinist or some guy play the
keyboard that sounded like a concert violinist.  I personally would go for
the real thing, and give the person who had put their hours of practice and
dedication to their work.  I'm all for the art aspect of the music.  
        Or, another spin.  Why do people go to concerts?  They want to see
their favorite songs played.  Last week I went to the Counting Crows show,
don't laugh I love those guys, and a friend of mine was complaining about
how they played everything slower and differently so she couldn't sing
along.  That's why I go to shows and raves as well.  I could just as easily
sit at home and listen to the CD and sing along to, without any surprise,
but going to see a show live, there's improvisation, covers of songs that
can't be bought in a store, and the feeling of "live", unless you go to the
Millie Vanillie concerts, ha ha ha.  
        Trying to get back on track here, what I want to say is that I think
the turntables are never going to be replaced as far as live shows go.  Some
guy could walk in to a rave, set up his computer with a program he made at
home to last for an hour or so, pick up his check, press play, and leave.  I
think people would be very disgruntled.  Don't you think there is a reason
why people stand around the turntables?  When I get to hot or tired to
dance, or just want to watch what I'm listening to, I usually try to graba a
spot next to the tables.  Anyway, surprise is good gentleman.  
        A wise man once said bigger isn't always better.  I agree with him.  

"Thanks to the interstate highway system, it is now possible to travel from
coast to coast without seeing anything."

much love,

did anyone notice, they replaced the "techno" category on yahoo with
"electronica."  "techno" is now a sub-category of "electronica."

i suppose some of you out there will say, "it's okay, 'electronica' is not
such a bad term...at least it's all-encompassing."  i might agree, except
for the fact that it is a derivative of that revivalist lounge/cocktail
music "exotica," which is as trendy a "scene" as there ever could be.  i'm
not sure about you, but i'd rather not be associated with such snobby or
backwards-looking people.  not that some of that chit wasn't phat as hell,
i mean esquivel and henri mancini are the bomb, but their music will
survive because it was _well-made_, not because of some trendmeisters. 

*sigh*  also, did anyone else notice the current trend of media-savvies
calling this stuff "electro"?!?!  as in, short for "electronic" or
"electronica"?!?!  agh! 

the chems ain't electro, i'm afraid.  slow-breaks, maybe (gosh i hope we

They did the name.change about 5 to 7 months ago.  At first I, too, was
surprized.  All my yahoo techno bookmarks had to be changed!  But, in the
world of the web, that happens...

The coining of the descriptor, "electronica," has been a few years in the
making.  I don't feel that it's a derivative of 'exotica.'  People have
been trying the name game on this genre since its inception.  _Techno_ in
its purest sense is music created by _Detroit_ artists in the late
1980's/early 1990's.  The term has evolved to cover basically anything
anyone wants it to.  Hell, some people have been erroneously calling Nine
Inch Nails techno!  And more genre.illiterate folk were looking for a more
catchall word because of this...hence 'electronica.'  I think it more
sounds like a band name than anything else.

I disagree that the name was chosen as 'backward-looking' or in a snobbish
manner.  After all, 'rock & roll' probably sounded pretty silly to those in
that underground, as well as 'new wave' or 'body music' or ... It's like
calling the information-technology-saavy the "digerati." (Although I kinda
like that one :) )

Henri Mancini was primarily a composer of TV/Movie music from the
middle/late 50s and through the 60s, for those out there who aren't
familiar -- and I do agree he was the bomb.

This, alas, is an example of the media NOT researching as deep as they
should, and abbreviating where the shouldn't.  If we don't like the abbrev.
 I think we should contact the authors of the articles, or the publisher
and write a little letter to the editor...

All this, I believe, is just our scene becoming _valid_ in the eyes of the
media.  But people seem to forget that it's BEEN valid in europe since the
early 90's.  Still, if we're gonna be written about, we better correct
those who make the mistakes...or others will just follow the erroneous
lead...you all dig?

It's like a news program jaunting off to a party/event, finding the first
person who's f***ed up and filming that, then leaving calling the whole
thing a drug thing.  PEOPLE, we have to set them straight.  If you see such
silliness, please try to interrupt the media and CALMLY and CONCISELY
explain what's going on.  There are just as many drugs in schools around
america every day, for heaven's sake - and worse!

hmm, not to disagree with you, but we associate with a good number of
those snobby and backwards looking people.  I don't mean to point fingers
or ride anybody's ass about it, but just look at some of the recent
comments in threads.  Most readers here, whether the stereotypes are
justified or not, are pretty uppity and opinionated when it comes to 'frat
boys', white trash in metallica t-shirts, beer, mainstream, etc the list
goes on.  Somehow though, there is a great injustice being done once
anybody stereotypes the rave scene with drugs.  you have to admit too,
that the rave scene is getting pretty trendy, regardless of whether
that is a good or bad thing.  That's all good and everything, and if
that's your deal, then go ahead and play with it.  If you want to be all
about unconditional and tolerant though, then run with that, but you gotta
actually believe in those words and know what it's all about.  

Again, not aimed at anybody so cool your gaskets..just some thoughts on
the general state of things..

amen.
thou art god (with the rest of us) pete sysko!!!
thaou hast begun using your mind, and thinking for yourself....i agree with
everything you wrote...and let me add one thing...
dance and music and raving (going under the name of tribal celebration or
worship) has forever "helped" one look inside and prepare the "self"
dance is definitely a tool of illumination...and once you know yourself
(and everyone else in there too) you are truely prepared for innovation,
for you will loosen the restraints on imagination.....raving is a good
thing...hell a GREAT thing....but it isn't new......and doesn't prepare you
for anything to come...it just helps break down the constrictive realities
of everyday life, and that cracks open the door to imagination...

oh....and there is something to be said for taking a risk and performing
live not pre-forming....dig??

i like the last word too...

peace (or whatever it takes)
Yip

true, but electro has changed alot recently [look at clear records london]
its alot more noisy and more experimental, but still minimal [sometimes] and
very electronic sounding.
slow breaks [to me] is just a "stlye" of electro.. more comercial way of
selling it. were electro was made with and 808 and what not analog gear[ARPs
and korgs..etc] . slow breaks is the same idea a structure, but with
samplers, and digital gear.

i consider most of my new tracks electro.. but my style.. its an idea, a
thought process [23 hahahaha] that makes it what it is.
[well im ranting on]
i hope to see more electro.. it's very dark, but fun at the same time. its
cheese and exerimental.. i've even seem some newer electro in jungle sections
at record stores. [ie: i found speedy j's patterns 12" in a jungle
section..and yes, i think his new stuff is electro.. not really dance
electro, but electro none the less.

oh.. but yes, the chemical bro arn't really electro.. they're to organic.. to
rocken roll

Hey all!

If anyone was at The Orb concert in Minneapolis last wednesday, you
couldn't have missed the video of the daning baby.  Well... if you _did_
miss it, I have good news for you, I was browsing arround today, and I
FOUND IT! :-) It's at <http://www.cyberworks.net/demo/jeff/> check it out,
it's a must see... (the music is funny too, not what was at the orb
concert).

Hi all,

I hope everyone from Cleveland had as great a time last night at the Orb
as I did!  I didn't know the Agora could be that much fun (actually, I
always have a great time there and can't believe how many wonderful
memories I have had over the years at that place -- for instance, exactly
a year ago was 7/20).

Anyway, I was wondering if some hardcore (or softcore) Orb fans could tell
me the names of two songs and whether or not they are still available on
cd.  The first song has the "Loving You" sample in it and the second
followed it directly last night (I believe the baby was on during it).  I
know that at least the first one is kind of old because I remember hearing
it on Rob Bertrand's radio show on WUJC back in the early 90's.

So . . . please e-mail me if you can identify either song and mention
what cd/tape they are on.

Thanks,

Braden

Hello again,

        What's the big deal dissing the chemical brothers here.  Sure maybe
they are gaining popularity with non-electronic music listeners, but what's
wrong with that.  Why does everything have to be underground?  Half or more
of the people on this list have become interested in this type of music in
less than two years.  If the Chemical Brothers are able to make good music,
and i think that they do, then why can't they be available to the public.
It's all turning into a big conspiracy against anyone who may be becoming
interested in the scene.  Why does it even matter where you're going to find
your music if you run out to National Record mart?  It's gonna be popular
one of these dayz, so just don't fight it.  I don't see why this even caused
such a great response.  Oh well, maybe I'm just babbling, but that's just
what the argument sounded like to me.  

"For four fifths of our history, our planet was populated by pond scum."
                                        -J W Schopf

much love,

-Paco

My main problem with Chemical brothers is their music, not because they are
on empty vee. let's just say this:

they used to be good.
kinda like underworld in their depeche mode phase.

Anyone know the line-up off hand for the next steel city jungle?
I think it was sine, dieselboy, adair + someone else, but I'm not sure.

On another note:  The new issue of my pseudo-paranoia-futurist/pittsburgh
rave calander zine TECHNOLOGY #4 *will* be coming out this week.  I assure
you.  Really.  No joke. It will this time.  Cross my heart and hope Bob
Sagett will die.  Its actually got some meat this time - 12 pages, half
size, graphics and all.  I'll have some @ Bounce, Slacker, the Beehives,
Hypervinyl, Randy's, and a few other places, but if you can't get a copy
and want to check it out, write me some email.  The zine is free, but if
you can pay postage or trade me for other zines I'd appriciate it.

II v2.0 - Youngstown, Ohio - 7/19/97
------------------------------------

PRE-PARTY BS

christa & i hung out w/ ian & his girly missy & did the chinese dinner
thingy then watched their bunny try to hump their cat (i guess u had to 
be there ;)

THE SPACE

so we get there & for some reason when they said it was brian's
party i kept thinking it was brian raushenbach's (the guy who threw
ORIGINS in y-town way back when), my ole break dance buddy, but it
was brian the guy who used to run the record store in trilogy brian,
dat wuz kewl w/ me cuz he remembered me prolly cuz i used to buy all
my hardcore trax from his store & he let me in...christa wasn't so
lucky...but later i compensated by buying everybody drinks...did i
mention it was in a coffee house...a true house party...very
reminiscent of the Persuasive Percussion party that ed did in that
ole frat house...very reminscent of the house party that dan curtin
firt played live as Lucky Charm @ 1961 Ford that i was involved with,
but that was in '91...oops i'm digressing...anyways it was in a three
story coffee house...which was kewl cuz u could get coffee & snacks
...oh u mean real drinks?...well there was a keg on the side porch
...the third floor was basically the chill room w/ a very home-made
screensaver video as visuals & couches to chill on...too bad there
was a rug on the floor, which made dancin' a li'l difficult

jamie, the pope of the fishy variety wuz still helpin set up when we
got there...but eventually things got underway

THE MUSIC

this kat on a wheelchair (sorry i'm not familiar w/ the new skool dj
names) spun some bumpin house traxx...it wuz pretty amazin' cuz this
kid had to sit parallel to the tables cuz it wuz so cramped back there

upstairs some dude spun some funky house traxx...unfortunately it wasn't
our flava, so it wuz around this time ian & missy went to hit the local
convenience store for some foties...they came back w/ a big bottle o bud
light & heiniken...ian knows my beer ;)

uhm oh yeah the music...i guess jawn spun at the party, but he doesn't
go by jawn now (i can't remember what his new dj name is now...some girl
even asked me who he was & i didn't know what to tell her)...i guess he
spins jungle now (i only knew when he was spinnin hardcore)...i was
impressed...christa like it cuz she likes jungle...i kinda watched her
dance

ian went on...his journey into trance packed the floor & jam me back in
the corner...i wuz too tired to dance then anyways...but i wuz very happy
he spun some RITM for me :)...the rest of it brought back memories of
the rooftop top party @ gill's new pad (yo g, when u gonna do anutha!)

THE PEOPLE

i guess casey, kevy kev's li'l sis wuz there...i didn't know 'til she told
me afterwards...surprised to see Lee there...call me a dumb ass, but i didn't
know jimmy went by Dreamweaver now...i'm still stuck on the Numm daze...kinda
bummed we missed out on his live set...but we were too tired by then anywaze
...alas there will be other partys ;)

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

short arm productions is throwing a small house party this saturday at 10 pm.
 this is the first semi-large scale production that has been publicized.  the
area is my house, which is about 20-25 minutes south of akron in jackson
township, which is right near canton/massillon.  if you are interested in
coming, email CircuitryX@aol.com or Lyquid420@aol.com for directions.  also,
if you are a DJ and would be interested in spinning saturday (which would
help get a scene started here =) ), email me or page (330) 320-7692 [not a
voice mail].  So far, the event will feature:

DJ Kev - spinning house
Circuitry - live electronic pa {also spinning trance/techno/jungle}
Vivasvan - live electronic pa

As you can see, we are somewhat short on acts, so if you have a spinning
talent and don't mind spinning at a free house party, get in touch with us.
 Besides these 3, several people that are helping out with the party will
probably spin as well, along with incorporating live mixes with dj's and
people playing synthesizers.  The space is not huge, and there is no smoking
indoors, but outdoor space is available.  Also, the event is free.

There is a little room in the back of the irish center that is away from 
the music, but they said there would be vendors, and that is ussualy 
where they are.  The site, is basicaly just a big open space, but there 
is a fence/hand railing thing right before the wooden dance floor that 
might be appropriate . . . I'll leave other people to decide the specifics.

although nothing like the real thing, digital scratching, shifting, and
lots of parameter-bending mediums are currently being used on popular
keyboards such as the korg trinity, and end up finding themselves on
records anyhow. ive used samples of scratches run through effects to sound
exactly like someone was actually doing it on the decks. its the illusion
that is key. sometimes it wont sound anything like the real thing, but one
thing is certain: the faster the processor you have, the more realistic or
dynamic it sounds.

>Sure, you can repeat it and interrupt it and run it back time after time,

the scratching is lost, but there are so many other things you can do to
spontaneously change a track that youve laid out, in real time of course,
making it LIVE :)

most of my music teachers use this argument against computer music. but
really, i cant play the violin. does that mean i cant make a song with a
violin in it unless i hire a violin player to record? NO!~ thats
troublesome, time consuming and expensive. to me, its all about the
illusion.  when your at a party and hear a saxaphone sound, does it really
matter to you how that was recorded? chances are it came from a real
saxaphone, recorded by a keyboard company, and resampled by the
composer/consumer of the keyboard. the fact that they are presampled does
not mean you dont have to be dedicated or work hard to be an electronic
musician. Aristotle said that art is imitation, so let it be imitated and
youll see that you cant tell the difference!~.

some dj's show play and leave too. but the ones that get away doing this
are very specific about record selection, and are still respected
regardless of their lack of live manipulation. the rule of thumb lies
within what it sounds like, not looks like, even though id rather watch
someone fuck around on a juno106 or basstation than on the decks :P

indeed, surprise is key. isnt a surprise to hang around a guy on an analog
synthesizer and a drum machine instead of usually hanging around peeping
the dj? i really cant see whats so ugly and abnoxious about a live pa.

heres my synopsis::

i picked up by coincedence jon and kc from baltimore at the bus stop in
front of the beehive right before i left(figured SOMEONE needed a ride:)
and we got there at 11:30 and there were a very good amount of cars there;
to add to the exitement. it was very very humid out and everyone was sort
of just trying not to sweat to hard in the early stages of the evening. i
missed dycpols set but i dont think i was in the mood for fast happy shit
then anyway..the sound completely sucked until some house dj came on who i
really didnt care for, but meanwhile that kid with the black hair that was
spinning (used to be a part of 168 i think; forget his  name) was spinning
some cool stuff but noone could really dance to it cuz the bass cabinets
were moaning for a better distrobution of electricity or whatever was the
problem. in the meantime i reunited with faces i havent seen in a while;
from clarion to erie to cleveland people, which was very delightful.
the guy after the 168 kid was okay, and i danced to his stuff for awhile as
it seemed the appropriate thing to do. we were told there was no rentry but
man im so glad they changed that before it hit 2am because it was soooo hot
in there... and the fans were a very good idea..essential to apease almost
unbearable inside dancing conditions.
after that i didnt really pay attention to any of the music at all, and
spent most of my time lingering outside and playing on the lawn. i waited
at the clothing netmeet thingy for about five minutes at midnight but didnt
really see any1 but i did see jon(ryu) and trevor throught the course of
the evening.
andy hughes really sucked probably because he didnt really care that much
about pittsburgh; i thought that was a shame; and doran chambers didnt rock
the house or anythign like that; mostly because the vibe was concentrateed
outside.. at one point there was contemplation about getting some speakers
and a generator and move it to the bottom of the lawn but that was sure not
to happen. right before i left at 5am i ran into april, a girl i met at
columbus after a renegade,the coincidence making it somewhat of a
worthwhile cause to stay longer than 3am.shes is crazy cool and im glad i
got to see here again..man i was so tired..i dont know why..
this party was very reminiscent of superfly without the mad amounts of acid
going around...
there was a back massage chain on the hill in the same fashion as the one
at superfly :) very cute.
i think the rent a cops there were smoking herb so there was no problem
with the law.

it seemed like this party was all about being happy and smiley even thought
the music sucked. its sorta what i excpected tho, and i give my props to
jon for pullinng off a very worthwhile first event. id have to give it a
fist class *blah* in my book though.

later.

i think pete summed up the night in a nutshell.
just a very lathargic (big word, eh?) vibe going around.
no motivation to dance, and yet i was tired all night.  i think
it had something to do with the heat and the amount of people that
were hanging around.  it was very crowded.

i had more fun harrassing people at the door than i did at
any other part of the night.  d.cypol's set was ok, but i think
it was a mistake to put a hh dj up first.  doran chambers was not
NEARLY as great as he was the last time i heard him a year or so
ago...and since they were the only 2 djs i was interested in hearing,
i don't know what anybody else sounded like.

the majority of the action took place on the lawn outside.  the whole
night reminded me of a shitty concert at the starlake ampitheater when
nobody cares about the band, but has fun with they're 15 dollar lawn 
seats anyways.  the swing set in the corner was a cool place to meet
people who came alone and needed a rest from the crowd.

ok bye,
love,
ryu

yeah john,, he pulled off his first party.. he broke even by midnight, and
started letting people in free after 2am [never seen that before]
its was fucking hot so i couldn't dance.. [the guy from 168] smoov played
some cool stuf, but the PA was skrewy. then some dj [i think andy hughs. or
something played some techno.. [very un inspireing] then doran chambers..
played genaric "rave" techno] and brownie threw some good acidy/flordia
breaks stuff, then i left.
i pretty much sat outside.. got look at like "who the hell are you? must be
his first rave"
that sucked, i wanted to punch some plur f**ckers out.

but it would have been a slaming party if i wasn't so jaded, and i used lots
of drugs, then it woulda rocked. 

im just glad john [he threw it] broke even and even made some $$ he a cool
ass super nice guy.. [one of those guys who make you remeber why you enjoyed
raving]

)but it would have been a slaming party if i wasn't so jaded, and i used lots
)of drugs, then it woulda rocked. 

Some.thing.is.wrong.

I wasn't at bounce.  Would hav been interesting, always curious about a
new promo group, but I was hanging out with the southward-bound Farmer Tea
and Grrl13.  

Anyway, I had a big conversation about that last quoted line there just
last night.  That's a realllllly bad attitude and a really bad sign for
the scene.  You shouldn't have to be fuqued off your head to have a good
time.  It sounds like the promotion was excellent.  That's the first step.
So there were plenty of people for a vibe, rgiht?  right.  But what was
missing?  sounds like extra fun stuff, silly accessories like whistles and
candy and goofy stuff like that.  

But I also get the impression that the attitude was simply wrong.  And I
bring this up about a party I didn'teven go to because I see it happen
again and again.  K and attitude have ruined Philly (and to some extent, I
blame shady/lazy/over-proud/inflexible promoters for driving kids to going
to parties only for drugs). Bad drugs and attitude also sent 1994 spinning
off into something ugly.  Ravers have become such sophisticated and
spoiled consumers that they're not automatically happy to be at a party. 
It's hard to maintain a scene in which average expectations cannot be
fulfilled with average resources.  Entertainment seems a bit passive
lately, not to mention so damn serious!  For pete's sake, is this still
supposed to be fun?  There are still places around the country where kids
are just happy to be at a party and that's how it was when all this first
started, supposedly. 

The way I see it, raving as we know it is formulaic and played out and I'm
too old to really care.  I'm still here because I still love the music
(although I'm sort of in crisis even over that) and I find the history
fascinating and beautiful, but the social part is 95% bullocks. I think if
it continues to be fun it will be because either it strips down to the
basics and rebuilds a bit, or it becomes an institution for the people who
always have and always will love it, rather the way house and jazz are
institutions.  Either way, the attitude, the negativity, the die-hard
seriousness and the bad drugs have got to go. Otherwise it's not fun and
how is entertainment supposed to continue if it's not entertaining?
Anyway, if those things don't go, I will.  I'm already halfway out the
door.  I often have more fun spinning or watching movies or talking with  
friends than going to a party.

On a less pouty note, we all know that the rave scene has been around for
quite a while and history is about primed for something new and
revolutionary.  I have my suspicions about where the next nutty
underground will come from.  Will it be saxophone plyaers from St. Louis? 
Will it be some sort of acidic jazzy artsy word-jazz stuff from New York? 
Will it be Stomp style busking? (I've always been a fan of street
drummers.)  will it be electronic experiementation like building
instruments out of toasters and burnt out floppy disk drives E.T. style? 
What do you think?  What have you seen that tripped you out?  Oh, and if
you believe it's worth it to keep on plugging with the scene and you wanna
convince me, by all means, bring it on.

bye bye
Miss Bitter

hmm. sometime i hate having to type thoughts..
just so there is no confusion. i do NOT use and DO NOT support drugs at
parties or anyother time.
i was just stating that, if your some druggy ass punk, you can't help but to
have fun cause your [the druggy, not YOU] is all cracked out.
but yes, im jaded.. most cause of the drug use.[by other people]

Interesting statement, only because it seems sooooo true.  But the thing is,
there are those who are just happy to be at a party, and (this may seem like
a repeat of one of the former discussions) its the newbies....  Sons and
daughters everywhere love just being there and being happy.  Heres a quickie
fo dat ass, I love to go to out of town parties, why... because I always seem
to get that newbie feeling..  Prime was Fam Affair, that shit jammed, met
some great people from OU (athens) and Warren OH, ended up that universal
groove was the crew I stummbled into including James Temple, Johnny V, Lemon
Lyman, they all spun on the second stage (well, the one by the woods in the
lower area) Then im BSin with this dude about the American Dairy council and
cheese adds :-} and Chris says, thats Hesohi, he basically threw this
party....  I just love suprises like that, and the funny thing is that it
went on all over that fucking campground, but its so hard to break the
boundaries of the clique thing or what ever you call it that makes it so hard
to leave the people you came with... know?  People make the vibe... and the
idea is to collect the right ones in one place and watch the magic.. It seems
to me the little tingly feeling was missing from Bounce, and its such a
fragile thing, funny thing is that when you get it you need to give it
away...

O.K., I guess it would be a good idea to post the song order so y'all 
know what you're listening to when you check it out :-) Last I tallked to 
Michael, he was still working on design for the J-Card, so I may just 
ship out the cassette without the J-card, and hope that Michael can put 
the image for the card on an FTP site, maybe on hyperreal or somethin'...

1) 1.8.7 - "Abducted"
2) Ryu (damn, I can't remember the title for this track ... wicked though)
3) ^x^C (send breaks) - "Cusp 26"
4) Cedrick Flupp - "Nikta"
5) Trout Soup - "31 seconds"
*flip over tape*
6) Skoop - "Okra"
7) Johnny Fingers - "Grito Escapade"
8) Psysko - "Funkshun::Redemption"

The list above is all from memory (which is bad) so spellings and track
names may not be enitrely correct and such, but the artist order is
definitely correct. 

I'll be sending cassette copies to everyone this week, before I split for
FLA.  Please make copies for all of your friends who want tapes.  Given
the amount of material that made it for the first tape, I hope y'all do
this again next year; the tape is 60 minutes and could easily have been
120!!  I also hope Projekt Haus Inc. has another "all live" party to
showcase our local talent, because there is a lot of good music being made
in our area. 

check y'allz l8r,
Toby

I think that would be Skoop.  His tape is very well produced, if you can 
still get in touch with him, I'd recommend getting a copy of the whole 
thing.

Does anyone know anything about a party in the 330 called Mind 
Pollination?  I was out at Trilogy's last night and someone gave me a 
flyer for its preparty called Anticipation.  All I know is that it's 
supposed to be on August 8 and 9.

Toby & everyone:

Howdy from out here in California!  It's awesome to hear that the tape is
done!  I'd *really* like a copy...if you could send me one, I'd really
appreciate it.  My new addy is:

	Jim Gourgoutis
	676 Bucher Ave.
	Santa Clara, CA  95051

	phone: 408.296.2971

Thanks a bunch, and congrats to all!

Jusss me here wif my lil' ole review of Bounce:

Personally I had a really good time, but this was in great part to the
Schenley High skool crew coming out in full effect.  There's definitly
lots of new HS kids coming to raves...i just hope its as fun for them as
it was for me (sadly i fear its not, but who can say?)  I mean, the 
promoter himself is only 19 (and went to Schenley too BTW)  Anyway, it was
good seeing so many happy familiar faces. :)

As usual, the irish center was a blazing inferno of smoltering lava-like
heat...but at least this time they had big, cool-looking industrial fans
for our cooling pleasure.  And ~2am they opened the doors, so about 50%
(maybe more) of the kids stayed outside for the rest of the night.  I
think this was a good thing - in fact i remember in old Irish center
parties they always had stuff outside too - i guess its just a sign of the
times. ???  Then again, it shows probably an accurate split of what the
people are there for - 50% mostly social, 50% mostly music/dance.  

The music was good overall, but as other kids said, not mind-blowing.
DCypol had a rockin' set, but a bit too early for most of the hardcore
kids.  It was an interesting experiment to put hardcore first though.  I
really liked Brownie's set - lots of cool breakbeat techno, but was soo
tired by then and all my kids were feelin' tired, we had to retreat.

Maximum goodness & hugs go out to House of Styles ---> I'm so glad to see
a new, honestly good promoter have a success.

	One final comment about what steph said - about ravers being
"...sophisticated and spoiled consumers..."  This seems to be quite true
on the surface...but is it different from other subcultures?  Or even
american culture in general?

	I'd say that raving for some people is a very opulent lifestyle -
lots of ravers are upper middle class kids with money enough to travel,
party, buy drugs, buy designer clothes, records, etc...  Buying lots of
stuff, in my experience, tends to make you appriciate what you have less.

At the same time, let me assure you that there are kids who *do* have fun
just being at a party...in fact they are the main, if not only reason i
keep going to raves.  There is stagnation in the rave scene, no one can
deny that, but its up to everyone to add their own creativity and energy
to push it in new directions, not just the "promoter".

sheesh, i get carried aways sometimes.

unfortunetly, for 90% of them, the rave didn't matter much. . . just an
excuse to stay up all night and get all fucked up. after hearing mad

I can't get realaudio due to the firewall here at work.  Is there any way
anyone out there can download the tape comp streaming realaudio file,
convert it into a non-streaming type, and then email me the sucker?  I'd
really like to take a listen.

        im glad im not the only one who disagrees with most of everyones
drug complaints.
i dont think drugs are tearing apart any sort of unity within the scene,
and i dont like it when people dont go to a party just because they hear
theres gonna be a lot of K or something. hey, some people dance better or
feel better on K than you do on it. doesnt that contribute anything to the
vibe? im not the type to break into a vet and steal boxes of viles but,
man, tranquilizers arent evil. *Fear* of tranquilizers, or any substance is
what continues to seperate the free spirted indivuals who make our scene
what it is with the solid state relative masses that cannot judge anything
a priori. The state of being tranquil should not be undermined by the
judgment of whether you do drugs or not to achieve that state.

	Allthough in general what you are saying is true, I've seen 
exceptions to this.  To me it does ruin the vibe if you can't go into the 
bathrooms, because there is a huge drug deal going on, or if you do go in 
and there is all sorts of shady guys/gals (yeah in the guys bathroom) 
making all sorts of transactions.  In that type of situation, who knows 
what could happen.  It also pisses me off, if you can't go five minutes 
without somebody either asking you for drugs, or asking you if you want 
drugs.  And the whole organized drug selling thing is generaly shady as 
well.  A friend of mine was told that if he bought a sheet at a 
particualr rave, that he would have his sheet and all his money 
confiscated, and get beaten up by two big guys.

Now that is the kind of stuff that ruins a vibe,

yes, and it is good to be physicly strong, but i don't think
you'd support steroids would you?  while drugs had a major part
in forming the scene and making it as beautiful as it was,
today they do NO good for it whatsoever.  i'm not afraid of drugs,
and i'm not against them neither.  but their presense at raves 
only hurts the scene.  ravers may think that they are exempt from
society and the media and peers and all that, but it's just a 
fascade. 

being tranquil is great...and something that should be strived for,
but if one uses drugs to acheive that state, all of the 
untranquil periods of their life will be amplified.  drugs only
supply a temporary state, and the temporariness of the state is
emotionally stressful.  if you want to be tranquil, develop tranquility
from the inside out.  

love,
ryu

anyone know what's up with the soundtrack for spawn?  at the end of the ad
you can see some of the featured artists for like half a second.  all i
could catch was goldie with henry rollins, filter with the crystal method i
think...i know ATR was doing a song with slayer for something...maybe this?
i also heard god within (scott hardkiss) is doing a track for a movie
soon...again, maybe this?  the information just isn't on the screen long
enough at the end of the commercial to really see.

if anyone has the soundtrack album, maybe you can let us know what's going
on?  reminds me of the judgement night soundtrack.  either way, i'm excited
as hell for the spawn movie ;)

may all your dreams be wonderful,
michael

One, I'm not sure you read Frank's post right.  Two, don't you EVER infer
anything about my behavior that you haven't seen for yourself.  Three, and
four and five and six can wait for a private message....

)	Allthough in general what you are saying is true, I've seen 
)exceptions to this.  To me it does ruin the vibe if you can't go into the 
)bathrooms, because there is a huge drug deal going on, or if you do go in 
)and there is all sorts of shady guys/gals (yeah in the guys bathroom) 
)making all sorts of transactions.  In that type of situation, who knows 
)what could happen.  It also pisses me off, if you can't go five minutes 
)without somebody either asking you for drugs, or asking you if you want 
)drugs.  And the whole organized drug selling thing is generaly shady as 
)well.  A friend of mine was told that if he bought a sheet at a 
)particualr rave, that he would have his sheet and all his money 
)confiscated, and get beaten up by two big guys.
)
)Now that is the kind of stuff that ruins a vibe,

WORD.  I find it strangely fascinating to hear the stratgies of promoters
who buy up lots of product, throw a party, and make the cash certainly
not from the party, but from the drugs.  Where have i heard that before? 
Could it be post-prohibition America?  Actually, I saw a neat thing on
prohibition the other night and what struck me was how things started all
happy-go-lucky and charming and new, gelled, started banging out its own
codes and regulations, and continuted to get more and more full of rules
until only the people at the very top had any control over the very
healthy alcohol underground. 

The rave scene has evolved that way clearly and I'm not even talking about
substances, but music, fashion, attitude.... Once an identity gets going,
the original freedom can start to slip.  I think many subcultures do this,
but I don't like being told what's cool, or feeling so much of the
presence of one thing that it's hard for me to delve into anything else. 
I find it much more refreshing to be in an environment where the norm or
the rules haven't been established, where no one element has a super
strong effect.  The scene is not like that for me now, and drugs are one
reason why, as absolut very aptly described.

I happened to be on the spawn web site www.spawn-themovie.com yesterday
at work and noticed a link for the soundtrack
http://www.music.sony.com/Music/ArtistInfo/Spawn/.  It's looks pretty
cool.  Good for a few kicks at least (I'm gonna buy it).  It has Slayer
with ATR, Butthole Surfers with Moby, Stabbing Westward with Wink, and
many others.  The only song that looks shitty is the one song that isn't
a teamup and is by Marlyn Manson.  I HATE Marlyn Manson!  I haven't
heard any of the RA or WAV files on the page yet because I don't have a
soundcard at work, but I'm curious to hear the Rollins/Goldie track. 
I've seen both of them live and can just image what they sound like
together.

peace out,
Johnny

Actually, I do believe that MM is teamed up w/ Sneaker Pimps, not just by
themselves.

Doesn't mean it'll be any good....

This is quite true...but there's some other stuff on there that should be
'tha-bomb'...SOUL COUGHING + RONI SIZE!  that's prob the best
collaboration i'v ever heard!  plus ATR & slayer should come up with
something good sounding...though probably not much diff from a regular ATR
track...:P

i think you read into my post a lil deeper than i thought yall would, or
maybe i just said it wrong. let me rephrase. all i was inferring was that
drug prejudice could be hurting the scene as much if not more than the
drugs themselves. its your right to avoid them and may be a good idea in
may circumstances; but really all they are objects which do not become
personified until a person uses them. once that happens, many people blame
the bad vibes produced on that object, but the question is not WHAT is
causing what; if youre sincerely concerned, it is "WHY are these *people*
abusing themselves?" and not "What can we blame the lameness of this
party/scene on?"  . Cmon people, if something is wrong with the vibe;
relocate and try again, remaining *OPTIMISTIC*.;. dig?

btw, i dont endorse K or anything, and i dont support steroids. Ketamine is
not a steroid i dont think, but regardless, i dont really care because i
dont do it anymore. it doesnt affect me when others are on it because i
dont really get jealous or crave it. you do only live once and i dont feel
an obligation to oppose an action (consuming Ketamine) that may be
considered dangerous if i dont feel endagered.. do you really feel
endangered by people who do K?and if youve been on the other side you know
that someone who doesnt like that you are on something shouldnt be afraid
unless you are.

i could go farther in to this debate, but i dont want to hurt anyones
feelings anymore. ill stick to my coffee and cigarrettes and continue to be
happy being me.
bye:)
