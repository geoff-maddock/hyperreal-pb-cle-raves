*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM

	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

hijack
avant house. deep detroit. berlin lounge.

featuring music by
aaron clark
edgar um
local

featuring a custom designed sound system by impact audio. for the room,

CONCEPT
--

hijack is an event series designed to introduce the modern styles of 
detroit and berlin's smaller venues to pittsburgh.

new amsterdam's environment will be transformed for each hijack.

local company inch pitch press creates unique pieces of art as 
promotional materials for each hijack. 1000 collectible pieces will be 
produced each month.

for the first event, 200 plastic access cards will be produced, and each 
attendee will receive one (which can then be used for reduced admission 
at future events).

hijack brings international talent regularly, including pittsburgh's 
first international resident, sage, from belfast, quarterly to the new 
amsterdam. well known for her intense drum and bass sets, her creation 
the all-female label phylum, and her landmark sponsorship for dc shoes, 
sage has recently taken to creating minimal, funky techno. she brings 
fresh productions and an international perspective as she stops here on 
her touring schedule.

each month will feature another well-respected musician alongside the 
residents edgar um, aaron clark and local.

rounding off the launch night is the announcement of hijack recordings, 
a new digital label that is seeking submissions for digital release. the 
first anticipated release, local's 'mystere,' will be in the summer of 
'09.

This is a special Birthday party for J-Me (u kno, that crazy chick with

pay $5 more... so u decide.

We are encouraging people to be creative and make your own shirt because 
there will be contests for the best 'I <3' shirts!

Lets be a lil more creative than I <3 NY


Also, at midnight there will be a huge group photo of everyone in their 
'I <3' shirts! copies of the photo will be made to be distributed.

Featuring your favorites...

Sat Feb 21                  FOR THE LOVE OF IT 4                 Pittsburgh

Flux capacitor Presents

For the Love of It... 4

A birthday celebration, dedicated to the love of the music, the love of 
the scene, and the love of the vibe, once again done for the love of 
it....

Featuring:

Punisher (Live)
Hej Records, Prosthetic Pressings
Detroit - Techno

Hailing from Detroit, Michelle Herrmann better know as just Punisher, is 
a petite techno veteran that packs a powerful punch. An observer and 
artist by nature, Michelle was drawn to music and the creative side of 
life since the beginning. She was fortunate to find her way into the 
Detroit techno scene in the early 90.s when the energy was awe 
inspiring, and from that moment Punisher emerged. From her career's 
onset in 1993 at only 15 years old, Michelle has set a precedent of 
raising the bar high for all things Punisher through flawless 
productions and dance floor igniting DJ and live PA set.

To back the momentum of her constant stream of releases, Punisher 
travels the world, djing and performing live PA sets on an array of 
machines.  The recent Hej tour took her to Miami for WMC, South America 
where she represented Detroit at the Monte Mapu festival and famed 
afters of Ricardo Villalobos, Dominica 54, and a headlining spot at 
Detroit.s 2008 DEMF Movement festival. Within seconds she can hypnotize 
a crowd, her sound, a unique blend of exotic techno, sassy funk, and 
electric driving beats, has resonated on dance floors from the United 
States to Canada, Europe and Latin America. Michelle has literally 
pummeled walls of sound alongside artists such as Pascal F.E.O.S., Adam 
Beyer, Joel Mull, Marco Carola, Ben Sims, Alex Under,  and countless 
others, next time it could be you!

  Think LOVE, MUSIC, and PEACE!

<strong>What is a RAVE?</strong> A rave party is a term that describes an all night dance party with fast-paced electronic music and light shows. At these parties you can expect to see DJ.s, live performers, and other acts playing all forms of electronic music including hip hop, trance, house, techno, and drum and bass with the accompaniment of laser light shows, projected images, and lots of fog.

In the early 1990.s, ravers often followed simple principles such as peace, love, unity, and respect otherwise known as PLUR. There was once a time when you could attend a party and everyone was thought of as a friend. A rave party was a way to escape from the problems of everyday life and join other people with similar interests in music, dance, art, and camaraderie. PLUR may be interpreted as the way that a raver believes he or she should live his or her life, and how people are expected to behave at a rave.


<strong>  The definition describing PLUR is:</strong>

<strong>P</strong>eace - Hostility typically serves no purpose other than to defend an ego that is lacking inner peace. To make peace with all people around you.

<strong>L</strong>ove - Acts and feelings of goodwill towards all others are a moral imperative with their own rewards. To stay close to all people and care for them unconditionally.    

<strong>U</strong>nity - This can mean either that: We are all united in the human condition, or as social beings, the feeling of connectedness with others is the ultimate end to our efforts. To stand together for the universal cause of peace and love

<strong>R</strong>espect - A person must show regard for the feelings of others through their actions and inaction. And one must have respect for oneself. To understand the diversities of culture.

While raves are nothing new to us, our goal is to bring back what we lost, create something new, and keep it exciting.
  We invite you to <strong>UNITE</strong> with us; bring your dancing shoes, a toy or piece of candy to give to someone, a smiling face, a glow stick or two, and LIVE for one night you will never forget!

<strong>LOWdown . Pittsburgh / NYC
                
- Featuring Tirade and C-Doc The WarHammer of SLAMjams</strong>

SLAMjamz is owned and run by Chuck D of Public Enemy.
  
Entering the game in 1994 with a mutual love and respect for Hip Hop; Tirade and C-Doc became LOWdown, taking a cue from classic Tribe (The Low End Theory) and The Beatnuts (Street Level). Influenced by greats from Pete Rock and CL Smooth, Eric B &amp; Rakim, Cash Money and Marvelous, Rob Base and DJ EZ Rock, to Captain and Tenille, they immediately embarked on tracks for their debut: groundZERO, a bass-heavy, boom-bap romp with mind provoking lyrics and captivatingly tight beats that promise evolution in the Hip Hop sound.

Current projects have these two members of the World's First Virtual Rapp Squad (The Impossebulls) bringing the LOWdown funk as a side project to their otherHip Hop efforts into the new era of music.

The only thing certain is that no matter what musical mask he dawns, being the main brain behind such acts as Omega Minus, Plorb@tron and Ki Ko Te, you are sure to be moved.

<strong>Terry Mullan</strong>, Chicago's turntablist extraordinaire, turns out dance floors week after week throughout the US and abroad. His credits include Coachella, Sullivan Room, Bugged Out, The End, Footwork, and Ruby Skye amongst raves as far off as Japan, Australia and Germany. He has developed a faithful following to those who know through his signature style of funky quirky jacking acid house combined with cutting and scratching making up an entirely new genre all his own.

The eighties posed as the formative years of Terry's career. Although his roots began in hip-hop, he found himself smack in the middle of the Chicago house explosion. House and Disco were styles of music that were entirely new to Terry, but the match was struck. Soon after gaining inspiration from Chicago air personalities like Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk, Fast Eddie, Armando, &amp; Mike &quot;Hitman&quot; Wilson via 102.7 WBMX, Terry made house his home. Next, when acid house hit the US, the link was completed; Terry found the sound he was looking for. It was that added flavor he was waiting for, something new, twisted and forward. Now all the elements were coming together. And with the addition of the Detroit sound, this was it, three different languages, disco, house and techno. They could all translate the same message together or apart from one another.With his fluent style, these languages reflect his DJ'ing as well as the tracks he's now composing, which is his way of furthering the evolution of dance music.

For the future, Terry is going beyond just knowing his machines. This sound is put to the test on his releases on Robsoul, Definitive, Control, Funk'd, Chicago Housing Commission, Aciiieeed, and on his own imprint, Catalyst recordings. Through his label he has released projects for the likes of DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley, Halo Varga, Mazi, Angel Alanis &amp; TJR, as well as for himself under the monikers, Acid OG's, Speakerphreaker, Tone Broke, and as Serotonin project on Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva's former imprint Definitive which featured Terry's track &quot;Sidewinder&quot; on the Chemical Brothers &quot;Brother's Gonna' Work It Out&quot; mix cd. Additionally, Terry gained notoriety for his records under the alias Speakerphreaker which includes the largely successful &quot;Products Of Our Environment&quot; EP on Catalyst which was featured on Pete Tong's essential selection on BBC radio 1 in the UK &amp; &quot;La Nina/Nickel Bag Da Funk&quot; EP on Smile which was licensed to several top DJ mix compilations. 

Terry's DJ'ing, label and tracks have earned him a reputation that extends worldwide. Never one to follow the masses, he borrowed from each genre to create what we all know to be Terry's sound, putting a bad ass twist on an otherwise conservative house scene.

You could describe her style as sexy and soulful. <strong>Lady Bandit</strong> always tried to maintain that feeling. &quot;It's feel good music! Music that makes you feel sexy and just...feel good!&quot; She spends most of her time playing breakbeats but house is her first love. She has been known to play Nu Skool, whether it be dirty, funky, tech-funk or progressive breaks. It really doesn't matter. Just as long as the basslines are deep yet dirty, while the beats are funky.

She also plays electro, progressive, and tribal house. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladybandit" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/ladybandit</a>

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff

time psytrance.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Feb 21                  FOR THE LOVE OF IT 4                 Pittsburgh

Flux capacitor Presents

For the Love of It... 4

A birthday celebration, dedicated to the love of the music, the love of 
the scene, and the love of the vibe, once again done for the love of 
it....

Featuring:

Punisher (Live)
Hej Records, Prosthetic Pressings
Detroit - Techno

Hailing from Detroit, Michelle Herrmann better know as just Punisher, is 
a petite techno veteran that packs a powerful punch. An observer and 
artist by nature, Michelle was drawn to music and the creative side of 
life since the beginning. She was fortunate to find her way into the 
Detroit techno scene in the early 90.s when the energy was awe 
inspiring, and from that moment Punisher emerged. From her career's 
onset in 1993 at only 15 years old, Michelle has set a precedent of 
raising the bar high for all things Punisher through flawless 
productions and dance floor igniting DJ and live PA set.

To back the momentum of her constant stream of releases, Punisher 
travels the world, djing and performing live PA sets on an array of 
machines.  The recent Hej tour took her to Miami for WMC, South America 
where she represented Detroit at the Monte Mapu festival and famed 
afters of Ricardo Villalobos, Dominica 54, and a headlining spot at 
Detroit.s 2008 DEMF Movement festival. Within seconds she can hypnotize 
a crowd, her sound, a unique blend of exotic techno, sassy funk, and 
electric driving beats, has resonated on dance floors from the United 
States to Canada, Europe and Latin America. Michelle has literally 
pummeled walls of sound alongside artists such as Pascal F.E.O.S., Adam 
Beyer, Joel Mull, Marco Carola, Ben Sims, Alex Under,  and countless 
others, next time it could be you!

  Think LOVE, MUSIC, and PEACE!

<strong>What is a RAVE?</strong> A rave party is a term that describes an all night dance party with fast-paced electronic music and light shows. At these parties you can expect to see DJ.s, live performers, and other acts playing all forms of electronic music including hip hop, trance, house, techno, and drum and bass with the accompaniment of laser light shows, projected images, and lots of fog.

In the early 1990.s, ravers often followed simple principles such as peace, love, unity, and respect otherwise known as PLUR. There was once a time when you could attend a party and everyone was thought of as a friend. A rave party was a way to escape from the problems of everyday life and join other people with similar interests in music, dance, art, and camaraderie. PLUR may be interpreted as the way that a raver believes he or she should live his or her life, and how people are expected to behave at a rave.


<strong>  The definition describing PLUR is:</strong>

<strong>P</strong>eace - Hostility typically serves no purpose other than to defend an ego that is lacking inner peace. To make peace with all people around you.

<strong>L</strong>ove - Acts and feelings of goodwill towards all others are a moral imperative with their own rewards. To stay close to all people and care for them unconditionally.    

<strong>U</strong>nity - This can mean either that: We are all united in the human condition, or as social beings, the feeling of connectedness with others is the ultimate end to our efforts. To stand together for the universal cause of peace and love

<strong>R</strong>espect - A person must show regard for the feelings of others through their actions and inaction. And one must have respect for oneself. To understand the diversities of culture.

While raves are nothing new to us, our goal is to bring back what we lost, create something new, and keep it exciting.
  We invite you to <strong>UNITE</strong> with us; bring your dancing shoes, a toy or piece of candy to give to someone, a smiling face, a glow stick or two, and LIVE for one night you will never forget!

<strong>LOWdown . Pittsburgh / NYC
                
- Featuring Tirade and C-Doc The WarHammer of SLAMjams</strong>

SLAMjamz is owned and run by Chuck D of Public Enemy.
  
Entering the game in 1994 with a mutual love and respect for Hip Hop; Tirade and C-Doc became LOWdown, taking a cue from classic Tribe (The Low End Theory) and The Beatnuts (Street Level). Influenced by greats from Pete Rock and CL Smooth, Eric B &amp; Rakim, Cash Money and Marvelous, Rob Base and DJ EZ Rock, to Captain and Tenille, they immediately embarked on tracks for their debut: groundZERO, a bass-heavy, boom-bap romp with mind provoking lyrics and captivatingly tight beats that promise evolution in the Hip Hop sound.

Current projects have these two members of the World's First Virtual Rapp Squad (The Impossebulls) bringing the LOWdown funk as a side project to their otherHip Hop efforts into the new era of music.

<strong>Terry Mullan</strong>, Chicago's turntablist extraordinaire, turns out dance floors week after week throughout the US and abroad. His credits include Coachella, Sullivan Room, Bugged Out, The End, Footwork, and Ruby Skye amongst raves as far off as Japan, Australia and Germany. He has developed a faithful following to those who know through his signature style of funky quirky jacking acid house combined with cutting and scratching making up an entirely new genre all his own.

The eighties posed as the formative years of Terry's career. Although his roots began in hip-hop, he found himself smack in the middle of the Chicago house explosion. House and Disco were styles of music that were entirely new to Terry, but the match was struck. Soon after gaining inspiration from Chicago air personalities like Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk, Fast Eddie, Armando, &amp; Mike &quot;Hitman&quot; Wilson via 102.7 WBMX, Terry made house his home. Next, when acid house hit the US, the link was completed; Terry found the sound he was looking for. It was that added flavor he was waiting for, something new, twisted and forward. Now all the elements were coming together. And with the addition of the Detroit sound, this was it, three different languages, disco, house and techno. They could all translate the same message together or apart from one another.With his fluent style, these languages reflect his DJ'ing as well as the tracks he's now composing, which is his way of furthering the evolution of dance music.

For the future, Terry is going beyond just knowing his machines. This sound is put to the test on his releases on Robsoul, Definitive, Control, Funk'd, Chicago Housing Commission, Aciiieeed, and on his own imprint, Catalyst recordings. Through his label he has released projects for the likes of DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley, Halo Varga, Mazi, Angel Alanis &amp; TJR, as well as for himself under the monikers, Acid OG's, Speakerphreaker, Tone Broke, and as Serotonin project on Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva's former imprint Definitive which featured Terry's track &quot;Sidewinder&quot; on the Chemical Brothers &quot;Brother's Gonna' Work It Out&quot; mix cd. Additionally, Terry gained notoriety for his records under the alias Speakerphreaker which includes the largely successful &quot;Products Of Our Environment&quot; EP on Catalyst which was featured on Pete Tong's essential selection on BBC radio 1 in the UK &amp; &quot;La Nina/Nickel Bag Da Funk&quot; EP on Smile which was licensed to several top DJ mix compilations. 

Terry's DJ'ing, label and tracks have earned him a reputation that extends worldwide. Never one to follow the masses, he borrowed from each genre to create what we all know to be Terry's sound, putting a bad ass twist on an otherwise conservative house scene.

You could describe her style as sexy and soulful. <strong>Lady Bandit</strong> always tried to maintain that feeling. &quot;It's feel good music! Music that makes you feel sexy and just...feel good!&quot; She spends most of her time playing breakbeats but house is her first love. She has been known to play Nu Skool, whether it be dirty, funky, tech-funk or progressive breaks. It really doesn't matter. Just as long as the basslines are deep yet dirty, while the beats are funky.

She also plays electro, progressive, and tribal house. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladybandit" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/ladybandit</a>

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Feb 21                  FOR THE LOVE OF IT 4                 Pittsburgh

Flux capacitor Presents

For the Love of It... 4

A birthday celebration, dedicated to the love of the music, the love of 
the scene, and the love of the vibe, once again done for the love of 
it....

Featuring:

Punisher (Live)
Hej Records, Prosthetic Pressings
Detroit - Techno

Hailing from Detroit, Michelle Herrmann better know as just Punisher, is 
a petite techno veteran that packs a powerful punch. An observer and 
artist by nature, Michelle was drawn to music and the creative side of 
life since the beginning. She was fortunate to find her way into the 
Detroit techno scene in the early 90.s when the energy was awe 
inspiring, and from that moment Punisher emerged. From her career's 
onset in 1993 at only 15 years old, Michelle has set a precedent of 
raising the bar high for all things Punisher through flawless 
productions and dance floor igniting DJ and live PA set.

To back the momentum of her constant stream of releases, Punisher 
travels the world, djing and performing live PA sets on an array of 
machines.  The recent Hej tour took her to Miami for WMC, South America 
where she represented Detroit at the Monte Mapu festival and famed 
afters of Ricardo Villalobos, Dominica 54, and a headlining spot at 
Detroit.s 2008 DEMF Movement festival. Within seconds she can hypnotize 
a crowd, her sound, a unique blend of exotic techno, sassy funk, and 
electric driving beats, has resonated on dance floors from the United 
States to Canada, Europe and Latin America. Michelle has literally 
pummeled walls of sound alongside artists such as Pascal F.E.O.S., Adam 
Beyer, Joel Mull, Marco Carola, Ben Sims, Alex Under,  and countless 
others, next time it could be you!

We are drawn to each other because of our diversity, unity, and love. <strong>UNITE</strong> and share the experience with us. Come out and make a new friend, forget your troubles, and be yourself. Remember . . . what you think . . . multiplies. 
  Think LOVE, MUSIC, and PEACE!

<strong>UNITE</strong> is the first of a series of monthly events that will showcase the finest talent in the area. The goal of <strong>Nocturnal Union</strong> is to grow the local electronic scene in a positive way, different than any event staged so far, by hosting creative, themed events.


<strong>What is a RAVE?</strong> A rave party is a term that describes an all night dance party with fast-paced electronic music and light shows. At these parties you can expect to see DJ.s, live performers, and other acts playing all forms of electronic music including hip hop, trance, house, techno, and drum and bass with the accompaniment of laser light shows, projected images, and lots of fog.

In the early 1990.s, ravers often followed simple principles such as peace, love, unity, and respect otherwise known as PLUR. There was once a time when you could attend a party and everyone was thought of as a friend. A rave party was a way to escape from the problems of everyday life and join other people with similar interests in music, dance, art, and camaraderie. PLUR may be interpreted as the way that a raver believes he or she should live his or her life, and how people are expected to behave at a rave.


<strong>  The definition describing PLUR is:</strong>

<strong>P</strong>eace - Hostility typically serves no purpose other than to defend an ego that is lacking inner peace. To make peace with all people around you.

<strong>L</strong>ove - Acts and feelings of goodwill towards all others are a moral imperative with their own rewards. To stay close to all people and care for them unconditionally.    

<strong>U</strong>nity - This can mean either that: We are all united in the human condition, or as social beings, the feeling of connectedness with others is the ultimate end to our efforts. To stand together for the universal cause of peace and love

<strong>R</strong>espect - A person must show regard for the feelings of others through their actions and inaction. And one must have respect for oneself. To understand the diversities of culture.

While raves are nothing new to us, our goal is to bring back what we lost, create something new, and keep it exciting.
  We invite you to <strong>UNITE</strong> with us; bring your dancing shoes, a toy or piece of candy to give to someone, a smiling face, a glow stick or two, and LIVE for one night you will never forget!

<strong>LOWdown . Pittsburgh / NYC
                
- Featuring Tirade and C-Doc The WarHammer of SLAMjams</strong>

SLAMjamz is owned and run by Chuck D of Public Enemy.
  
Entering the game in 1994 with a mutual love and respect for Hip Hop; Tirade and C-Doc became LOWdown, taking a cue from classic Tribe (The Low End Theory) and The Beatnuts (Street Level). Influenced by greats from Pete Rock and CL Smooth, Eric B &amp; Rakim, Cash Money and Marvelous, Rob Base and DJ EZ Rock, to Captain and Tenille, they immediately embarked on tracks for their debut: groundZERO, a bass-heavy, boom-bap romp with mind provoking lyrics and captivatingly tight beats that promise evolution in the Hip Hop sound.

Current projects have these two members of the World's First Virtual Rapp Squad (The Impossebulls) bringing the LOWdown funk as a side project to their otherHip Hop efforts into the new era of music.

Those who know his music often describe it as unclassifiable. Known for his voluptuous bass lines and ethereal rhythms one never knows what to expect and is never disappointed by one of his performances. The only thing certain is that no matter what musical mask he dawns, being the main brain behind such acts as Omega Minus, Plorb@tron and Ki Ko Te, you are sure to be moved.

<strong>Terry Mullan</strong>, Chicago's turntablist extraordinaire, turns out dance floors week after week throughout the US and abroad. His credits include Coachella, Sullivan Room, Bugged Out, The End, Footwork, and Ruby Skye amongst raves as far off as Japan, Australia and Germany. He has developed a faithful following to those who know through his signature style of funky quirky jacking acid house combined with cutting and scratching making up an entirely new genre all his own.

The eighties posed as the formative years of Terry's career. Although his roots began in hip-hop, he found himself smack in the middle of the Chicago house explosion. House and Disco were styles of music that were entirely new to Terry, but the match was struck. Soon after gaining inspiration from Chicago air personalities like Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk, Fast Eddie, Armando, &amp; Mike &quot;Hitman&quot; Wilson via 102.7 WBMX, Terry made house his home. Next, when acid house hit the US, the link was completed; Terry found the sound he was looking for. It was that added flavor he was waiting for, something new, twisted and forward. Now all the elements were coming together. And with the addition of the Detroit sound, this was it, three different languages, disco, house and techno. They could all translate the same message together or apart from one another.With his fluent style, these languages reflect his DJ'ing as well as the tracks he's now composing, which is his way of furthering the evolution of dance music.

For the future, Terry is going beyond just knowing his machines. This sound is put to the test on his releases on Robsoul, Definitive, Control, Funk'd, Chicago Housing Commission, Aciiieeed, and on his own imprint, Catalyst recordings. Through his label he has released projects for the likes of DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley, Halo Varga, Mazi, Angel Alanis &amp; TJR, as well as for himself under the monikers, Acid OG's, Speakerphreaker, Tone Broke, and as Serotonin project on Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva's former imprint Definitive which featured Terry's track &quot;Sidewinder&quot; on the Chemical Brothers &quot;Brother's Gonna' Work It Out&quot; mix cd. Additionally, Terry gained notoriety for his records under the alias Speakerphreaker which includes the largely successful &quot;Products Of Our Environment&quot; EP on Catalyst which was featured on Pete Tong's essential selection on BBC radio 1 in the UK &amp; &quot;La Nina/Nickel Bag Da Funk&quot; EP on Smile which was licensed to several top DJ mix compilations. 

Terry's DJ'ing, label and tracks have earned him a reputation that extends worldwide. Never one to follow the masses, he borrowed from each genre to create what we all know to be Terry's sound, putting a bad ass twist on an otherwise conservative house scene.

You could describe her style as sexy and soulful. <strong>Lady Bandit</strong> always tried to maintain that feeling. &quot;It's feel good music! Music that makes you feel sexy and just...feel good!&quot; She spends most of her time playing breakbeats but house is her first love. She has been known to play Nu Skool, whether it be dirty, funky, tech-funk or progressive breaks. It really doesn't matter. Just as long as the basslines are deep yet dirty, while the beats are funky.

She also plays electro, progressive, and tribal house. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladybandit" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/ladybandit</a>

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

Subject: {pb-cle} whatever we want to hear 10-12 Wed @ Annabell's (re)vision

The guys at Tek-Know/(re)vision have invited us (experimedia) to come
out every last Wednesday of the month to play whatever the hell we
want from 10-12.
As you know giving us this freedom could be a dangerous thing.  But at
least it will be interesting.
So if you want to hear a clusterfuck of obscure tunes/genres nice and
loud come on out.
Its an early slot so those of us with a day job dont have to stay up too late.
It wont be strictly electronic at all times.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Growing up on hip hop as a teen, Teknobaby collected records such as the 
Sugar Hill Gang, Fat Boys, Run DMC, and the Beastie Boys. Attending teen 
clubs every weekend, Teknobaby teamed up with a breakin' crew and 
performed at several clubs around the city. Teknobaby's favorite artists 
were Slick Rick and Doug E Fresh, later followed by electronic artists 
such as DEE-Lite, Technotronic, Snap, and many others.

Teknobaby's love of electronic music began in 1989 when he discovered 
CD's such as Rave Til Dawn and 140 BPM. In 1992, Teknobaby purchased his 
first house record by Lil Louis' called French Kiss. A few months later, 
Teknobaby attending his first rave and fell in love with the music and a 
new form of dance. Teknobaby spent a few years traveling the U.S., 
dancing til the sun came up, while studying all variations of house, 
techno, jungle, and trance in the underground scene.

In 1994, after producing several underground events and trying his hand 
on the 1200's, Teknobaby traveled to the Underground Record Store in 
Orlando and began ordering records from Chris Fortier, DJ Icey and 
Kimball Collins. From there, Teknobaby also began a collection of acid 
tracks, ordering from DJ Sneak at Gramophone Records in Chicago. This 
included hits like Robert Armani's "Circus Bells", a few by Hyperactive, 
and many others.

>From 1995 to 1996, Teknobaby began touring as a DJ, spinning at 
underground events, while holding a residency at Sparks, a local night 
club in Louisville, KY. In early 1996, Teknobaby's love for techno 
directed him to his friend Heather Heart at Sonic Groove Records in New 
York where he finally discovered his true style.

Through 1996 to 1999, Teknobaby toured across the South and Midwest, 
bringing the techno flavor to all who would endure it, while throwing 
some reputable underground events in several cities in the midwest.

DJ Teknobaby has released 6 tapes and 4 CD's. Some of Teknobaby's 
favorite artists and performers are Richie Hawtin, ESP Woody McBride, 
Oliver Ho, Dave Ralph, Thomas Krome, Joel Mull, Laurent Garnier, Jeff 
Mills, Donald Glaude, and Heather Heart.

>From touring the country checking out new DJ's, producing underground 
events, and turning it out on the tables, Teknobaby packs old school 
feelings and true raver examples.

<strong>What is a RAVE?</strong> A rave party is a term that describes an all night dance party with fast-paced electronic music and light shows. At these parties you can expect to see DJ.s, live performers, and other acts playing all forms of electronic music including hip hop, trance, house, techno, and drum and bass with the accompaniment of laser light shows, projected images, and lots of fog.

In the early 1990.s, ravers often followed simple principles such as peace, love, unity, and respect otherwise known as PLUR. There was once a time when you could attend a party and everyone was thought of as a friend. A rave party was a way to escape from the problems of everyday life and join other people with similar interests in music, dance, art, and camaraderie. PLUR may be interpreted as the way that a raver believes he or she should live his or her life, and how people are expected to behave at a rave.


<strong>  The definition describing PLUR is:</strong>

<strong>P</strong>eace - Hostility typically serves no purpose other than to defend an ego that is lacking inner peace. To make peace with all people around you.

<strong>L</strong>ove - Acts and feelings of goodwill towards all others are a moral imperative with their own rewards. To stay close to all people and care for them unconditionally.    

<strong>U</strong>nity - This can mean either that: We are all united in the human condition, or as social beings, the feeling of connectedness with others is the ultimate end to our efforts. To stand together for the universal cause of peace and love

<strong>R</strong>espect - A person must show regard for the feelings of others through their actions and inaction. And one must have respect for oneself. To understand the diversities of culture.

While raves are nothing new to us, our goal is to bring back what we lost, create something new, and keep it exciting.
  We invite you to <strong>UNITE</strong> with us; bring your dancing shoes, a toy or piece of candy to give to someone, a smiling face, a glow stick or two, and LIVE for one night you will never forget!

<strong>LOWdown . Pittsburgh / NYC
                
- Featuring Tirade and C-Doc The WarHammer of SLAMjams</strong>

SLAMjamz is owned and run by Chuck D of Public Enemy.
  
Entering the game in 1994 with a mutual love and respect for Hip Hop; Tirade and C-Doc became LOWdown, taking a cue from classic Tribe (The Low End Theory) and The Beatnuts (Street Level). Influenced by greats from Pete Rock and CL Smooth, Eric B &amp; Rakim, Cash Money and Marvelous, Rob Base and DJ EZ Rock, to Captain and Tenille, they immediately embarked on tracks for their debut: groundZERO, a bass-heavy, boom-bap romp with mind provoking lyrics and captivatingly tight beats that promise evolution in the Hip Hop sound.

Current projects have these two members of the World's First Virtual Rapp Squad (The Impossebulls) bringing the LOWdown funk as a side project to their otherHip Hop efforts into the new era of music.

Chris Lash is an experimental electronic musician who has been actively writing and performing various forms of music since 1994. His work ranges from dance music to new age. Those who know his music often describe it as unclassifiable. Known for his voluptuous bass lines and ethereal rhythms one never knows what to expect and is never disappointed by one of his performances. The only thing certain is that no matter what musical mask he dawns, being the main brain behind such acts as Omega Minus, Plorb@tron and Ki Ko Te, you are sure to be moved.

<strong>Terry Mullan</strong>, Chicago's turntablist extraordinaire, turns out dance floors week after week throughout the US and abroad. His credits include Coachella, Sullivan Room, Bugged Out, The End, Footwork, and Ruby Skye amongst raves as far off as Japan, Australia and Germany. He has developed a faithful following to those who know through his signature style of funky quirky jacking acid house combined with cutting and scratching making up an entirely new genre all his own.

The eighties posed as the formative years of Terry's career. Although his roots began in hip-hop, he found himself smack in the middle of the Chicago house explosion. House and Disco were styles of music that were entirely new to Terry, but the match was struck. Soon after gaining inspiration from Chicago air personalities like Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk, Fast Eddie, Armando, &amp; Mike &quot;Hitman&quot; Wilson via 102.7 WBMX, Terry made house his home. Next, when acid house hit the US, the link was completed; Terry found the sound he was looking for. It was that added flavor he was waiting for, something new, twisted and forward. Now all the elements were coming together. And with the addition of the Detroit sound, this was it, three different languages, disco, house and techno. They could all translate the same message together or apart from one another.With his fluent style, these languages reflect his DJ'ing as well as the tracks he's now composing, which is his way of furthering the evolution of dance music.

For the future, Terry is going beyond just knowing his machines. This sound is put to the test on his releases on Robsoul, Definitive, Control, Funk'd, Chicago Housing Commission, Aciiieeed, and on his own imprint, Catalyst recordings. Through his label he has released projects for the likes of DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley, Halo Varga, Mazi, Angel Alanis &amp; TJR, as well as for himself under the monikers, Acid OG's, Speakerphreaker, Tone Broke, and as Serotonin project on Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva's former imprint Definitive which featured Terry's track &quot;Sidewinder&quot; on the Chemical Brothers &quot;Brother's Gonna' Work It Out&quot; mix cd. Additionally, Terry gained notoriety for his records under the alias Speakerphreaker which includes the largely successful &quot;Products Of Our Environment&quot; EP on Catalyst which was featured on Pete Tong's essential selection on BBC radio 1 in the UK &amp; &quot;La Nina/Nickel Bag Da Funk&quot; EP on Smile which was licensed to several top DJ mix compilations. 

Terry's DJ'ing, label and tracks have earned him a reputation that extends worldwide. Never one to follow the masses, he borrowed from each genre to create what we all know to be Terry's sound, putting a bad ass twist on an otherwise conservative house scene.

You could describe her style as sexy and soulful. <strong>Lady Bandit</strong> always tried to maintain that feeling. &quot;It's feel good music! Music that makes you feel sexy and just...feel good!&quot; She spends most of her time playing breakbeats but house is her first love. She has been known to play Nu Skool, whether it be dirty, funky, tech-funk or progressive breaks. It really doesn't matter. Just as long as the basslines are deep yet dirty, while the beats are funky.

She also plays electro, progressive, and tribal house. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladybandit" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/ladybandit</a>

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

days....
