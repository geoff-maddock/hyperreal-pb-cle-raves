Indirectly, I suppose, since they were next to the decidous azalea,
butterfly bush and tomatoes. They're not my main concern, though. The damn
morning glory vines are trying to overrun the place - and no, I don't care
two shits about their psychedelic properties.

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} Crop Circles - Thanks!

Thank you very much to all who came out to Crop Circles.=20
I am so grateful for the Goahead crew that has developed
over the last few years. This has really helped us take
production to another level and it could not be done
without them. There are so many people that do a lot
of things behind the scenes to make it a true experience.
These events have become real family gatherings with
lots of great memories.

As far as attendance, I stopped being concerned about attendance
numbers a long time ago. It's obviously important to have
people attend your event, but the overall success cannot
be judged by just attendance. I can say that our events have
had a consistent 100-150 people on a regular basis. For=20
a psy-trance scene in Cleveland, that's pretty good. It's
really great to see the good mix of people that come out,=20
many from out of state. The age range is really diverse=20
and has a real post rave scene flavor to it. There seems
to be a lot more respect returning then there has been in
recent years. With the exception of some people ripping
off some of our deco.

I think this was our best production to date. The people, art, and
music all came together in a way that I have not experienced
before. Jiga and Jino from Analog Pussy even commented
that they can see Cleveland is on the verge of something=20
solid happening in the psy-trance community.

The music was on point in both rooms. This was on of the
first events that we were able to showcase our local=20
dj lineup from a psy-trance perspective. Moke, UZI, and
Ari, did not let us down and dropped continuously mixed
down sick shit on everyone all night! I know that it's not
in everyone's taste, but us Goahead's like it hard, pumping,
techy, psychedelic and aggressive at about 145-150 bpm's
Look at where we live, then you can begin to understand
that concept. Ari did bring us in for a nice landing in the
morning though with some sweet full-on progressive sounds.
We got a New York City bitch slap when Shikid took over
the decks! This is why he remains in my list of top 5 favorite
dj's. He always adapts his style to the crowd and the timeslot
and you always hear tunes that you are only going to hear
from a New York City pimp dj! Groovy shit brotha! It was so=20
great to have you out Shay! I only feel sorry for the people
that didn't get to hear him diggin deep into his music collection=20
at the afterhours, because you know that's when you
are going to hear trax that you may never get
a chance to hear again. Those are the moments I live for. Analog
Pussy!!!!! Jiga and Jinno, these are some true heads
and audio technicians. I think very few artists could have=20
accomplished what they have with this flavor of psy-trance they have
created, which is very trance and roll! Their production
is top notch and they had everyone gettin the funk down!
Thank you for bringing your knowledge and great vibes
to our gathering! The multi-genre room was bumpin all
night too. This was not just a second room with a random
sound system. This was some of North East Ohio's
finest dj's putting on a seminar! We just realize that especially=20
here in Ohio, that people need a break from the psy-trance sickness,=20
from time to time. So we try to accomodate that, and
I think we do it very well. If you have never heard
a tag team set by Meghan and Boompsie, then you are
really missing out. Meghan can throw down psy-trance with
the best of them, but Meghan's and Boompsie's roots are in
techno and when they get together, they don't let you=20
forget that. Serious respect goes out to those ladies!
I really do like jungle when it's played by the right dj.
Jea Leigh and Majestic handled that very well for us
and the jungle beat was a good compliment to what
was going on in the stage room. I even saw Jinno=20
in there bobbin his head for a minute. If you want
to talk Cleveland rave history, then you will hear the
name Trout Soup, he's been doin this for a while now.
Thanks for another great set! Goahead's lineup of=20
dj's features pretty much only psy-trance and techno=20
dj' and producers, but our boy Nox is an
exception. The one thing I look for in dj's as a promoter
is someone who spins the music they are passionate
about. You can really tell the difference. This is why
we added Nox to our dj family, because if you want to=20
hear house music, Nox has got you covered! Thanks
again to all the dj's and performers!

You can't have a good party without GREAT SOUND! Let me
repeat that. You can't have a good party without GREAT SOUND.
Thank you Alberto/Cosmic Traveler and Mike C who make
sure that happens. They are very good at what they do and
the event would not be the same without them.

Thank you Goahead deco crew. Just look at the pix, but
even they don't do it total justice. You just had to be there.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Aug 08                       RYAN ELLIOT                     Cincinnati

RaceCarProductions.com is proud to present a night of Ryan Elliott from 
Spectral Sound / Ghostly International!

Ryan Elliott [Spectral / Ghostly International]
Upstart Detroit DJ Ryan Elliott has gained notoriety over the past few 
years by programming sets that are as well crafted and sophisticated as 
they are danceable. From ice cold minimal techno to summery house beats, 
Elliott has played both big rooms and martini bars with equal success. 
As a DJ, Ryan is adept in the late night hours, finding the balance 
between heavy floor tracks and elegant crowdpleasers. Utilizing three 
decks, multiple audio sources, and outboard effects are par for the 
course, and Elliott employs them with the utmost skill to keep crowds 
engaged.

With a fervent interest in the emerging international techno scene, he 
is a walking dictionary of artists, labels, and releases. Elliott held 
his Tuesday night events at Ann Arbor.s Goodnight Gracie with Matthew 
Dear from 2002 to 2004, bringing back energy to the city.s nightlife. 
Ryan Elliott was also asked to be a resident at Detroit.s weekly 
Untitled alongside Dear, Tadd Mullinix, Mike Servito, and Derek 
Plaslaiko. In 2005 he began a new residency at Detroit.s Oslo, and 
created a stellar 33-track mix for the 2xCD edition of the Spectral 
Sound Volume 1 compilation.

Bernstein [Tokyo, Japan / Nordform Records / RaceCarProductions.com]
Bernstein, the moniker of Cody Norenberg, lives and breathes electronic. 
As a DJ he has been playing everything from techno to electro for almost 
a decade. His obsession with electronic music doesn't stop at being a 
DJ, in a little over two years he has established himself as a literal 
mastermind at music production. He is the Japanese counterpart of the 
electronic group The Republic with Matthew Cooper of Cincinnati, Ohio. 
In addition, he perfects the genre of minimal techno as a solo project 
from wherever his laptop is powered up.

Bailey
// da drum and bass punisher // metalheadz, swerve, intasound

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey?s South London stomping
ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, DJing at
house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the mellow hip hop of
the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and harder; Acid House ?
the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the rave scene. It was on
this acid house path, in around ?91 that he found a turning for hardcore,
inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of this road he entered the
door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate station
Energy FM. It was his ability on that very station that impressed Kemistry
and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play at one of the first
Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. Through moving on the
circuit Bailey joined forces with other influential South London selectors
and MCs, forming the Inta Natty crew which consisted of himself,
Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known for
managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm and
Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by playing
in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America
and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has been all over the
mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some of which include: One
Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric Live, The End,
Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldies club Metalheadz and
Fabio?s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people want
has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting line up,
every Sunday night (11pm ? 1am) and in 2003 he won the award for ?Best Radio
Show? at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for many
projects including mixed CDs for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of Sound,
France?s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass record
store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size & A
Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja and in
2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing tracks from
cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he has
the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an impression
and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ?s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to
recognition and respect.

Plush @ Mynt Presents - John Kelley 8-26-05

26 August 2005

John Kelley - Moonshine, Ball of Wax, www.djjohnkelley.com - California

In 1993, John Kelley began DJing at California's full moon desert
gatherings. Fusing the instrumental sounds of house, techno and 
breakbeat into a hard, tribal, psychedelic style that won him fans and 
critical raves throughout the 1990s, Kelley also displayed his skills to 
a national audience through a host of successful DJ mix albums, 
including the Funky Desert Breaks series and the High Desert Soundsystem 
series. In the late '90s Kelley traveled all over North America and 
toured with Orbital and The Crystal Method as the official DJ of 1999's 
Community Service Tour. With more critically acclaimed mix CDs, 
including his United DJs of America entry, Kelley began touring 
internationally in 2000, hitting Central America, Japan, Southeast Asia 
and Australia.

The beginning of a new decade also brought Kelley's first music 
productions, including El Mirage's "Tribal Divide," a Simply Jeff 
colaboration with "Jello Jigglin'" and the bittersweet gem "Rapture At 
Sea" with Eastern Sun. Famous for his eclectic tastes, generous spirit 
and natural ability to rock a dance floor, DJ John Kelley learned his 
love for techno and house music in the heyday of the LA rave underground 
of the early '90s. Attending legendary warehouse parties like 
Aphrodite's Temple of Love and religiously following DJ Doc Martin week 
after week to the seminal Flammable Liquid, Kelley inherited the 
cultural spirit of the underground while being inspired by the ethos of 
some of the world's best underground DJs. Within three years, Kelley's 
underground reputationleadto a higher profile, a relationship with 
Moonshine Music bringing snapshots of his music journeys to an eager and 
growing following. In 1996, Kelley debuted with "Funky Desert Breaks,"
now an underground cult classic that showcased his skills and sound to a
wider, unsuspecting audience. In 1997, "Funky Desert Breaks 2" charted a 
more progressive direction, but easily connected with the growing North
American rave scene. A transition in Kelley's sound began with 1998's
refreshing "Knee Deep," a less serious and more club-friendly mix of 
house, techno, trance and breakbeat. With 1999's "High Desert 
Soundsystem" and 2000's "High Desert Soundsystem 2," Kelley retained his 
desert roots while displaying a growing taste for global trends, 
compressed together in exciting and vibrant combinations.
United DJs of America 19" followed in 2001 to critical acclaim, and was
nominated at 2002's Winter Music Conference as one of the best DJ mix 
albums of 2001.

In 2002, after a busy schedule touring internationally, Kelley
began to focus on writing his own music. Scaling back his DJ 
engagements, he also started the Ball of Waxx music production company 
with his friend David de Laski, LA's Lord Runningclam. Collaborating 
with de Laski, Simply Jeff, Moontribe's DJ Brian Gollub, and LA producer 
Brian Saitzyk, Kelley pushed out a growing catalog of vital productions, 
including the brooding beauty, "Rapture at Sea." In 2004, while Kelley 
advanced his production chops, he made a more visible return to the 
DJcircuit in anticipation of techno's current revival.

Elysium - Inner Child and Groove Shop Records

Respected for his enduring role in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland rave scene, 
Brad Thomas, aka Dj Elysium has, in the past eight years, garnered a 
reputation as one of the finest house DJs in the tri-state area.

It wasn.t long into Brad.s DJing career, that promoters, both national 
and local, were interested in placing Brad along sides the likes of acts 
like; Carl Cox, Bad Boy Bill, and Charles Feelgood. Over the years, 
Brad.s sound evolved to include many forms of house including: funky, 
disco, speed garage, 2-step, vocal, jazzy, hard UK, and booty. His 
musical influences include Titonton Duvante, Feelgood, Bad boy Bill, 
Eric Morillo, MJ Cole, and DJ Sneak.

In recent years, Brad has continued to maintain his busy schedule of 
performing including: multiple long-term club residencies, special 
events and numerous raves.

Elysium has always been ahead of the game, as a performer and artist. 
After moving to Pittsburgh in the summer of 2002, Thomas shifted his 
musical focus to production. Although he still maintains a rigorous 
performing schedule, Thomas can also be found working hard in the studio 
with production partner DJ 7up. The two have collaborated on numerous 
releases for Jes One.s Groove Shop records of Chicago, as well as 
projects with Patrick Norman of Rusted Root.

platetektonix.net in association with
ohm resistance, acme art company and the lemon house collective present:


S.O.S.

submerged (live PA) - nyc dnb
(ohm resistance, subtitles, obliterati)

Its hard not to feel the impact of Submerged, be it his work with the
legendary Bill Laswell, remixing Herbie Hancock for Sony, or founding
one of the most influential stateside drum n bass labels (ohm
resistance). Also co-founder of the Obliterati label, Submerged has
carved his name in the stone wall of music history with the help of
radio airplay, releases on countless labels, and support from some of
the biggest names in electronic music. Fresh off a US and two European
tours, Submerged will land in Columbus Ohio on 8/26! You don.t want to
miss this rare live PA set of the amazing drum n bass he has become
world renowned for.


temulent - detroit dnb
(ohm resistance, obliterati, canvas, bassdrive, los luchadors de muerto)

Father of the Obliterati imprint and founding member of Ohm Resistance .
the name Temulent has become synonymous with the no-holds-barred,
near-death drum and bass that he has been spinning and producing for
almost a decade. Fans of his sound can expect nothing less than his
trademark landscapes of bleak paranoia and unabashed aggression. 
Temulent is coming to destroy Columbus in true Ohm Resistance style.


enduser - germany dnb/breakcore
(outbreak, ohm resistance, ad noiseam, sonicterror, too many to list)

With the help of radio play from John Peel, Bailey, and the Breezeblock
on Radio 1, a string of great reviews, and the backing of some of the
top names in the hardcore and drum n bass worlds, Lynn Standafer's
musical juggernaut has landed spots working with artists like The Bug,
Panacea, Needlesharing, Soundmurderer, Resonant Evil, NYC hardcore band
Terror, and many others. His recorded output has become the stuff of
legend on respected cult labels such as Ant-Zen, Mirex, Ad Noiseam, The
Bug's Razor's X, and UK drum and bass leader Outbreak. In addition to
Enduser's prodigious output, Standafer is also producing music for
Acclaim US, scoring independent films, and operating his own
experimental drum and bass label, Sonicterror Records

zeno & judas - d-town dnb tag
(platetektonix, obliterati, los luchadors de muerto)

nical - nyc dnb

broken army - c-bus dnb

it's not illegal to drink.

it's not illegal to drink and drive.

it's illegal to be impaired enough that you are a risk behind the wheel.
obviously if you're coherent enough to fuck with a sheriff, you're
really not that impaired.  if you bolt from the car and run into the
trees, chances are, your ass is impaired.

Subject: {pb-cle} moving cleveland / pittsburgh thing


So I know my last letter was kinda emotional. I've been going thru 
some heavy things at home with my family that makes me never want to 
return for them again. I'd explain, but this email would turn into a 
novel by the time I'm done with it.

My decision for moving back to Pittsburgh has nothing to do with 
whether or not Cleveland sucks at all. Since I've been back, I've 
seen nothing but great things happen here. One of the biggest things 
standing out in my brain is seeing more than a handful of people here 
opening their minds to different genres. That's another email, for 
another day...

Anyways... If some of you guys from here and Pittsburgh could keep 
some eyes and ear open on places for rent / roommates needed, I'd 
really appreciate it a lot.

www.craigslist.com is the bomb in listings too. Been peeking around 
both cities.

Again thanks guys. It means a lot.

Jea.

04. Latatoo (Purple Mix) Russia 06:33

"The 12' Vinyl for this release will be available Nov/Dec 2005.
This release has something very speacial. The hard work and deadication to their
work each track shows a small insight to the producers know as Sleepy Town
Manufacture. The music comes from their soul and it shows in this highly
anticipated release. Unit 21 and Lackluster also put in two incredible remixes
though you will have to hear them in order to understand what I am talking
about. =-)

Yeah, if your moving to San Diego, Real World style is the right way to go with the cost of living being tremendous. I was just in San Diego for five days and I have to say that it is one of the most pleasant places I have ever been. The beaches are beautiful and the weather is to die for, La Jolla was my favorite beach. The downtown area is not extremely impressive, but there are a lot of other smaller ocean retail spots that are pretty cool, like Ocean beach, which would be the perfect place for Milk. Even though the living is expensive there are a lot of jobs available, and to have their beached and weather all year round, it's totally worth it. I think I am going to have to give it a try. Hope things are well back in Ohio. I'll be leaving Sanfran on Saturday night, till then....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} krunk'd

Some dude on Myspace this week said that I was "hot enough to 
go"..  and asked what I was doing.

I think I'm playing some where that night..

who knows.

my only reason to go, is so i can smack alien gonzales for acting 
like he's a pimp. but that's another story...

I'm sharing this down to you guys.. I got this today on myspace.



R.I.P. DJ TOAST (Hunter)
Body: I've been around, DJing for quite some time now, and i've ran 
into many interesting people.

One that really left a mark was DJ Toast from St. Louis.

He was a DJ for the Midwest Avengers, a friend of all STL. party 
kids, and anyone that was down with music.

My fondest memory is drinking a nasty piss-warm 40oz. with him on 
some dirt track for some outdoor rave called Family Affair 1 in 
Akron, Ohio. He was like a white 'Huggy-Bear' and dressed in snazzy 
retro clothing. The guy knew his raregroove tunes, and was fucking hilarious.

He ended his own life the other day.

R.I.P.

Subject: {pb-cle} San Fransico info anyone?

Anyone on here know any cool places to check out in San Fran?

I'm leaving on Friday for like a week there and am just looking for
suggestions since I haven't been there before.   Found a couple things
on SFRaves but would love some suggestions from someone thats familiar
with the city.  Anyone know any good record stores to pick up dnb out
there?

So far this is all I got to do for the week:

See Dub Tribe and Hesohi at Blue Cube when i get there <- lucked out on tha=
t.
I want to check out the seals at Fisherman's Warf.
Visit winieries and drive along the coast.
oh yeah and get krunked!

thanks in adavance.

If tech tv was still actually good, would sit in on "The Screen  
Savers" but it sucks now.  Although not this sunday, but next sunday  
the people from the twit cast (basically all the old screen savers  
people) are going to record their podcast live at some bar.  Details  
should be at http://www.twit.tv (btw, their podcast is pretty cool if  
you're into techie stuff)

I'm sure there's going to be parties happening around there you can  
always look for.  Maybe join up on the san fran raves list (whatever  
it's called) and ask?

Check out the Qool party on Wednesday 5pm-10pm at the art gallery 
at 111 Minna (South of Market). You won't believe the number of 
people getting the f down at that hour and day of the week to some 
really great DJs... From there, somone's always hosting a 
co-sponsored afterparty. www.looq.com www.jondiandspesh.com

You'll want to dig through the bins at Amoeba Records on the 
Haight; also on Haight is Tweekin' Records...definitely stop in 
there; the last time we did we randomly ran into John Howard. You 
also should get to know Nikola there. In those places you'll find 
flyers to various gatherings and one-offs.

The sound system at 1015 Folsom is worth hearing.

For more club options options check out www.mvgals.net

Have fun!

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

KEM (Selectabreaks, Bassrock, Tomorrow Sounds, Nu-Freaks . Portland, OR)  
|| www.djkem.com

A rising star in the nuskool breaks scene, Kem has become an instant 
favorite of some of the world.s biggest tear out all-stars with his 
masterful production of beats and basslines. Currently riding on the 
buzz of his last two 12" releases, "Rugged"/ "Dusted. (Transformer Man 
remix) [Tomorrow Sounds, UK] and his remix of Transformer Man's .Hell 
Hound. [Bassrock, UK], Kem has people everywhere talking about his 
tracks. Aquasky called .Hell Hound. "A blessed-out tech funk roller of a 
tune!" Also under his belt is the breaks bootleg of Kanye West's 'Get Em 
High', which hit #7 on Streetwise Music.s charts earlier this year.

 

Kem has a heavy release schedule slated for the next couple of months. 
Due out in August on the UK label Lose Your Friends is .Suckerpunch,. 
featuring remixes by both the Spanish outfit Amnexiac and UK's 
Transformer Man. A funky, gritty tune with a b-line that smacks of old 
Koma and Bones, .Suckerpunch. is already getting play from DJ Mutiny, 
30hz, DJ Quest and Nitro among others. Following is a remix of 
Transformer Man's "Light Nectar" on the Belgian label Nu-Freakz, and 
also "I Rip It" on the mighty Spanish Selectabreaks.

 

Over the years Kem has DJed extensively throughout the Northwest, parts 
of Canada and as far east as Baltimore, steadily gaining notoriety for 
his dynamic mixing and hard-as-nails sound. During his time with crews 
Darkcity, Virus and N.B.A. he has played alongside such world-class 
breaks talent as Aquasky, Rennie Pilgrem, Chris Carter, The Crystal 
Method, Hyper, Atomic Hooligan and Influenza.

Bailey
// da drum and bass punisher // metalheadz, swerve, intasound

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey?s South London stomping
ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, DJing at
house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the mellow hip hop of
the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and harder; Acid House ?
the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the rave scene. It was on
this acid house path, in around ?91 that he found a turning for hardcore,
inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of this road he entered the
door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate station
Energy FM. It was his ability on that very station that impressed Kemistry
and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play at one of the first
Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. Through moving on the
circuit Bailey joined forces with other influential South London selectors
and MCs, forming the Inta Natty crew which consisted of himself,
Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known for
managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm and
Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by playing
in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America
and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has been all over the
mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some of which include: One
Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric Live, The End,
Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldies club Metalheadz and
Fabio?s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people want
has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting line up,
every Sunday night (11pm ? 1am) and in 2003 he won the award for ?Best Radio
Show? at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for many
projects including mixed CDs for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of Sound,
France?s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass record
store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size & A
Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja and in
2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing tracks from
cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he has
the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an impression
and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ?s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to
recognition and respect.

Plush @ Mynt Presents - John Kelley 8-26-05

26 August 2005

John Kelley - Moonshine, Ball of Wax, www.djjohnkelley.com - California

In 1993, John Kelley began DJing at California's full moon desert
gatherings. Fusing the instrumental sounds of house, techno and 
breakbeat into a hard, tribal, psychedelic style that won him fans and 
critical raves throughout the 1990s, Kelley also displayed his skills to 
a national audience through a host of successful DJ mix albums, 
including the Funky Desert Breaks series and the High Desert Soundsystem 
series. In the late '90s Kelley traveled all over North America and 
toured with Orbital and The Crystal Method as the official DJ of 1999's 
Community Service Tour. With more critically acclaimed mix CDs, 
including his United DJs of America entry, Kelley began touring 
internationally in 2000, hitting Central America, Japan, Southeast Asia 
and Australia.

The beginning of a new decade also brought Kelley's first music 
productions, including El Mirage's "Tribal Divide," a Simply Jeff 
colaboration with "Jello Jigglin'" and the bittersweet gem "Rapture At 
Sea" with Eastern Sun. Famous for his eclectic tastes, generous spirit 
and natural ability to rock a dance floor, DJ John Kelley learned his 
love for techno and house music in the heyday of the LA rave underground 
of the early '90s. Attending legendary warehouse parties like 
Aphrodite's Temple of Love and religiously following DJ Doc Martin week 
after week to the seminal Flammable Liquid, Kelley inherited the 
cultural spirit of the underground while being inspired by the ethos of 
some of the world's best underground DJs. Within three years, Kelley's 
underground reputationleadto a higher profile, a relationship with 
Moonshine Music bringing snapshots of his music journeys to an eager and 
growing following. In 1996, Kelley debuted with "Funky Desert Breaks,"
now an underground cult classic that showcased his skills and sound to a
wider, unsuspecting audience. In 1997, "Funky Desert Breaks 2" charted a 
more progressive direction, but easily connected with the growing North
American rave scene. A transition in Kelley's sound began with 1998's
refreshing "Knee Deep," a less serious and more club-friendly mix of 
house, techno, trance and breakbeat. With 1999's "High Desert 
Soundsystem" and 2000's "High Desert Soundsystem 2," Kelley retained his 
desert roots while displaying a growing taste for global trends, 
compressed together in exciting and vibrant combinations.
United DJs of America 19" followed in 2001 to critical acclaim, and was
nominated at 2002's Winter Music Conference as one of the best DJ mix 
albums of 2001.

In 2002, after a busy schedule touring internationally, Kelley
began to focus on writing his own music. Scaling back his DJ 
engagements, he also started the Ball of Waxx music production company 
with his friend David de Laski, LA's Lord Runningclam. Collaborating 
with de Laski, Simply Jeff, Moontribe's DJ Brian Gollub, and LA producer 
Brian Saitzyk, Kelley pushed out a growing catalog of vital productions, 
including the brooding beauty, "Rapture at Sea." In 2004, while Kelley 
advanced his production chops, he made a more visible return to the 
DJcircuit in anticipation of techno's current revival.

Elysium - Inner Child and Groove Shop Records

Respected for his enduring role in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland rave scene, 
Brad Thomas, aka Dj Elysium has, in the past eight years, garnered a 
reputation as one of the finest house DJs in the tri-state area.

It wasn.t long into Brad.s DJing career, that promoters, both national 
and local, were interested in placing Brad along sides the likes of acts 
like; Carl Cox, Bad Boy Bill, and Charles Feelgood. Over the years, 
Brad.s sound evolved to include many forms of house including: funky, 
disco, speed garage, 2-step, vocal, jazzy, hard UK, and booty. His 
musical influences include Titonton Duvante, Feelgood, Bad boy Bill, 
Eric Morillo, MJ Cole, and DJ Sneak.

In recent years, Brad has continued to maintain his busy schedule of 
performing including: multiple long-term club residencies, special 
events and numerous raves.

Elysium has always been ahead of the game, as a performer and artist. 
After moving to Pittsburgh in the summer of 2002, Thomas shifted his 
musical focus to production. Although he still maintains a rigorous 
performing schedule, Thomas can also be found working hard in the studio 
with production partner DJ 7up. The two have collaborated on numerous 
releases for Jes One.s Groove Shop records of Chicago, as well as 
projects with Patrick Norman of Rusted Root.

Plate Tectonics Presents TechMix featuring:

We've been wanting to bring Michelle "Punisher" Herrmann in for quite a 
while, and after hearing her set at Fuse-In decided we needed to make it 
happen. Michelle will be gracing us with a live PA/DJ hybrid 
performance. More info and mixes will follow in the coming weeks. Expect 
a night of innovative techno, from minimal to stomping, and possibly 
even some drum and bass thrown in for good measure (she played some live 
at Fuse:in).

This show will be in the $5 range

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight - SHAWN RUDIMAN live, LOLA and THE INSTIGATOR

TONIGHT  08.12.05

[D E F I A N C E]

[SHAWN RUDIMAN] - LIVE - Technoiraudio

In 1989 Shawn Rudiman started production work with Ed Vargo on THD (Total 
Harmonic Distortion). This ebm/elektro unit became quite popular in the ebm/ 
industrial scene of the early to mid 90's, releasing 4 full-length albums, 
countless remixes and compilation releases on European and domestic labels. 
Along with this, a fascination with old music machines developed that led 
him to techno. In 1997 he decided to retire the long worn out industrial-ebm 
ideals. this led to a move towards pure rhythm and sounds, and a relocation 
to Pittsburgh, PA the transition period was difficult due to a scaling back 
of sound layers and refinement of rhythms, but results proved positive. At 
the same studio production began with techno, so did live sets. Sets of 
non-stop, all live improvised techno, as fluid and smooth as any dj set, but 
entirely flexible in direction and tempo. He then started Hypervinyl Records 
with Trevor Combee. This led to meeting Anthony Shakir and that to 
releaseing tracks for Dan Bell and 7th City etc. He and friend Jwan allen 
have since started a new label, Technoir Audio. Today he resides somewhere 
in the ghettos of Pittsburgh and plays live on a regular basis in the 
mid-west area. "one of the best live p.a.'s i've ever seen."- Anthony 
"shake" Shakir

[LOLA] - New York City - Deepseenyc.com / ASND (Anothe Scientific Needle 
Drop)

After years sampling New York City's diverse nightlife environment, Lola 
became intrigued with the interaction between dancer and DJ. Having spent 
years in New York's underground, and attending events as diverse as Giant 
Step, Soul Kitchen, Ray Hands' Loft (Brooklyn), Bang the Party, Konkrete 
Jungle, and clubs from ClubUSA, Twilo, Life, and the Palladium to smaller 
venues like Tilt, Sound Factory Bar, 205 Club, Den of Theives, and Coney 
Island High, Lola's musical perspective came to embody a collision and 
cohesion between various strains of underground music. Her interest in how 
dancers danced and how DJs selected music inspired her to tell her friend 
Eric "EMan" Clark, then an up-and-coming DJ who had just launched Bang the 
Party, that she wanted to try her hand at DJing. The rest, as they say, is 
history.

Lola became EMan's mentee and got her first taste of playing in public at 
Sapphire Bar & Lounge, a rather fortuitous place seeing as Deep See would 
return there in 2003. Lola founded Deep See in May 2000 with EMan at 
Guernica on New York's Lower East Side. Since then, it's been a continuous 
progression of learning music, promoting, and the business of creativity in 
New York City. Lola and EMan continue to collaborate on music events 
including Deep See and Beyond.

Lola's style is a jack-inspiring combination of deep, tribal, and pumpy 
house, tech-house, Detroit techno, ambient interludes, broken beat, African 
and Latin percussion, and basically anything that sits left of center and 
below the radar. Lola has played throughout New York City at venues 
including Centro-Fly, Speed, the Sullivan Room, Frank's Lounge (Brooklyn),

[TREVOR COMBEE] aka The Instigator - Atlanta, GA

Either you are going to have the time of your life with him or his presence 
and DJ set will destroy you.  People that know Trevor understand this.  
Which ever, it's worth the gamble and no party is complete without The 
Instigator.  Mr. Combee's time in PGH was a vital stepping stone to the 
Electronic Music Scene in this city.  Early Raves, Record Store, Record 
Label, Late night sets at afterhours ... this guy did it all.  If you were 
too young to remember then you best come out and recognize.

for those who might not know, trevor is the best pgh deejay ever.
dont believe any hype you might ever hear to the contrary. dude is
off the hook. honestly, he was one of the biggest musical
influences on me, and quite probably alot of other people as well.
he was the first person i heard playing italo disco and shit like
that way back when it was really really slept on. ive heard and
seen so many memorable sets from him that i couldnt even put a
number on them. his set to close the PBS party "chaotic
transdimension" in dec 99 is probably the best set i ever heard at
a rave. he played dopplereffekt, ton loc, new order, selway, the
theme from "a clockwork orange", etc. totally insane.

Yeah, I've gotta agree; I saw the Instigator on the email subject, and
did a little OMG WTF while sitting here.  Go to this.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Tonight - SHAWN RUDIMAN live, LOLA and THE INSTIGATOR

I met Trevor when he was still in highschool ... When he was in this Depeche 
Mode cover band playing at a talent show ...  He was the first person to 
ever show me what two TTs and a mixer could do ... this was back in '92 or 
'93.  I've been through thick and thin with this guy ever since.  Either you 
love him or hate him ... and even sometimes both at the same time.  Great 
memories ... especially like when we would hang out at his apartment in 
Grove City playing records - a bunch of us - and when he was tired and 
wanted people to leave he would call the cops on himself and have them come 
and shut down his party and kick people out ... and the times he would 
randomly show up on my doorstep in Shadyside with Sun Ra video tapes or 
Lenny Bruce tapes that he 'needed' me to watch with him.  There is no one 
like him.

Trevor is playing first tonight - 9:00pm to 10:30pm.  That's the way we have 
to do it ...

but I'm working on getting a gig put together for Wednesday Aug 17th ... a 
night for Trevor to play headliner.  Most likely at Havana.  I'll post it 
once I know.

awesome. 

just to put it all in perspective, this is trevor's set from our
rave that he was originally supposed to play around 11 pm at.
things got all screwed up and he got pushed back to the last set,
7 am. he was cool with this under one condition: we had to buy him
another entire case of beer just for him. he drank all goddamn
night, i couldnt believe he was still standing up when he played.
but he murdered it.

Subject: {pb-cle} all Fuse-In sets are up

Don't think I ever mentioned I got all those sets up.  Well I do.   
Not sure how long though since I don't really have room to put  
anything else on there, maybe I'll start taking out the less  
downloaded ones starting next month.

http://files.vrillusions.com/

also I added an annoucement list I'll mention things that I add and  
remove, this will probably be one of the few times I mention the site  
on here, since that's the idea of the announcement list so only  
people that care about it will get notified about it.  Anyway, have  
at it.  I did just notice the akufen set is pretty close to hitting  
the quota this month, so if it does by the end of the month (which is  
looks like it will) I'll definitely keep that up for another month.

A friend of mine from NYC got me into this album. I really encourage 
you guys to check it out if you're into the downtempo / ambient 
sounds. It's really awesome, and I've been enjoying this for about a week now..

I know it says 1998, but how the hell did I miss something this good?...

I just wanted to share with you guys. =)

Friday, August 19th

@ Wish Nightclub

with 3 rooms of pounding...beats


Bailey
// da drum and bass punisher // metalheadz, swerve, intasound


Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey?s South London stomping
ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, DJing at
house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the mellow hip hop of
the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and harder; Acid House ?
the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the rave scene. It was on
this acid house path, in around ?91 that he found a turning for hardcore,
inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of this road he entered the
door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate station
?Energy FM?. It was his ability on that very station that impressed Kemistry
and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play at one of the first
Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. Through moving on the
circuit Bailey joined forces with other influential South London selectors
and MC?s, forming the Inta Natty crew which consisted of himself,
Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known for
managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin? Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm and
Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by playing
in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America
and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has been all over the
mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some of which include: One
Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric Live, The End,
Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldie?s club Metalheadz and
Fabio?s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people want
has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting line up,
every Sunday night (11pm ? 1am) and in 2003 he won the award for ?Best Radio
Show? at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for many
projects including mixed CD?s for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of Sound,
France?s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass record
store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size & A
Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja and in
2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing tracks from
cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he has
the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an impression
and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ?s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to ?
recognition and respect.



dj FIXX
// florida breaks pioneer! // bottom end records, afterdark records

One of the pioneers of the funky breaks movement across the nation, DJ Fixx
has proven just that with his incredible production and intense DJ
performances. After basically carrying the Kaleidoscope Music label for over
3 years, Fixx now runs his independent monthly label, Bottom-End Records -
now one of the top 5 best-selling break beat labels in the country. With
over 120 12" record releases and 4 massively-distributed CDs under his belt,
DJ Fixx has one of the strongest followings of any other break beat
producer. Whether he?s touring in a city near you or simply in the studio
producing his next anthem, Fixx always brings Nothing But Bottom!


ILLY MC
// philly M.o.C. // illyemcee.com, substitution



Destroying trends, smashing through adversaries, and perfecting the art of
being; Illy emcee's album "Living in the Moment" is here to forge ahead, and
rearrange the current sound of hip-hop. Geared towards the educated
consumer, this album is laced with engaging lyrical content and rock solid
production. Working with German based hip-hop phenom, Minnox, as well as
Philly based artists, Dstar, J Smooth, and Ducketts; Illy focuses on
bringing back quality and creativity to music.

Moving from Baltimore, to Philadelphia proved a prosperous relocation.
Linking up with the likes of Armmani, Sharpness, and Messinain, he could be
heard at Diesel Boy?s infamous club night, Platinum. Illy also sets it off
the second friday of every month, with Mental Sharp at "the free hip hop
party".

On the production side, Illy forms the "Brigade" with Noisemachine and
Tension. They aim to please with quality tracks ranging from catchy dance
floor killers, to melodic, vibing jams. Illy's work can be heard on Phylum
recordings and the knowledge mix cd (may 2005 mixed by silver), as well as
and collabortations with the likes of SS, Skibadee, MC Trip, Killa Kella,
Spor and the Black Sun Empire.

Subject: {pb-cle} Funny Image

I do those mypoints survey things every now and again, and for humor
this time i actually looked at the offers they are trying to get you
to buy.

I sure am glad I did.

I found the following advertisement:
https://www.mypointsoffer.com/Templates/MyPoints3000/images/nutrophy.gif

Nutrophy Orange X or as I like to pronounce it, Nut Trophy Orange X.

"Nutrophy Personalized Weightloss System - Free Sample Are you TRIM,
FIT and SEXY enough to GET INTO THAT BIKINI? Get your FREE one week
supply that helps to curb your appetite, enhance your metabolism and
brighten your mood! Only pay $6.85 Shipping & Handling!"

So it's speedy AND it's got a name with X in it; that's brilliant. =20

Their slogan should be "Cute advertising for the aspiring
methamphetamine addicts."

i: wonder
Goose

ps. i wonder if this email gets caught in anyone's spam filters?

no less ... the guy is known to dissappear then show up without warning.  I 
now have Trevor's records at my house as collateral ... so he'll be there

Not sure what you mean by the above...

Everyone who was asked to perform are some of the North Coast's finest -
for what they play and what they do.

They are the same familiar faces you might see out and about most weekends
- even when they are not playing or promoting - gasp!

Another way to look at it is a small nod to the people who've
played/supported past Midnight Mixers

If by political you mean well put together, then thank you...

Our stage will be a showcase for Cleveland's electronic music scene rather
than focus on one or two djs for the evening.  We thought this was the
best way to use the opportunity of running a stage at the festival.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Bailey
// da drum and bass punisher // metalheadz, swerve, intasound

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey?s South London stomping
ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, DJing at
house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the mellow hip hop of
the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and harder; Acid House ?
the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the rave scene. It was on
this acid house path, in around ?91 that he found a turning for hardcore,
inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of this road he entered the
door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate station
Energy FM. It was his ability on that very station that impressed Kemistry
and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play at one of the first
Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. Through moving on the
circuit Bailey joined forces with other influential South London selectors
and MCs, forming the Inta Natty crew which consisted of himself,
Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known for
managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm and
Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by playing
in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America
and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has been all over the
mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some of which include: One
Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric Live, The End,
Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldies club Metalheadz and
Fabio?s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people want
has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting line up,
every Sunday night (11pm ? 1am) and in 2003 he won the award for ?Best Radio
Show? at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for many
projects including mixed CDs for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of Sound,
France?s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass record
store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size & A
Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja and in
2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing tracks from
cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he has
the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an impression
and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ?s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to
recognition and respect.

Plush @ Mynt Presents - John Kelley 8-26-05

26 August 2005

John Kelley - Moonshine, Ball of Wax, www.djjohnkelley.com - California

In 1993, John Kelley began DJing at California's full moon desert
gatherings. Fusing the instrumental sounds of house, techno and 
breakbeat into a hard, tribal, psychedelic style that won him fans and 
critical raves throughout the 1990s, Kelley also displayed his skills to 
a national audience through a host of successful DJ mix albums, 
including the Funky Desert Breaks series and the High Desert Soundsystem 
series. In the late '90s Kelley traveled all over North America and 
toured with Orbital and The Crystal Method as the official DJ of 1999's 
Community Service Tour. With more critically acclaimed mix CDs, 
including his United DJs of America entry, Kelley began touring 
internationally in 2000, hitting Central America, Japan, Southeast Asia 
and Australia.

The beginning of a new decade also brought Kelley's first music 
productions, including El Mirage's "Tribal Divide," a Simply Jeff 
colaboration with "Jello Jigglin'" and the bittersweet gem "Rapture At 
Sea" with Eastern Sun. Famous for his eclectic tastes, generous spirit 
and natural ability to rock a dance floor, DJ John Kelley learned his 
love for techno and house music in the heyday of the LA rave underground 
of the early '90s. Attending legendary warehouse parties like 
Aphrodite's Temple of Love and religiously following DJ Doc Martin week 
after week to the seminal Flammable Liquid, Kelley inherited the 
cultural spirit of the underground while being inspired by the ethos of 
some of the world's best underground DJs. Within three years, Kelley's 
underground reputationleadto a higher profile, a relationship with 
Moonshine Music bringing snapshots of his music journeys to an eager and 
growing following. In 1996, Kelley debuted with "Funky Desert Breaks,"
now an underground cult classic that showcased his skills and sound to a
wider, unsuspecting audience. In 1997, "Funky Desert Breaks 2" charted a 
more progressive direction, but easily connected with the growing North
American rave scene. A transition in Kelley's sound began with 1998's
refreshing "Knee Deep," a less serious and more club-friendly mix of 
house, techno, trance and breakbeat. With 1999's "High Desert 
Soundsystem" and 2000's "High Desert Soundsystem 2," Kelley retained his 
desert roots while displaying a growing taste for global trends, 
compressed together in exciting and vibrant combinations.
United DJs of America 19" followed in 2001 to critical acclaim, and was
nominated at 2002's Winter Music Conference as one of the best DJ mix 
albums of 2001.

In 2002, after a busy schedule touring internationally, Kelley
began to focus on writing his own music. Scaling back his DJ 
engagements, he also started the Ball of Waxx music production company 
with his friend David de Laski, LA's Lord Runningclam. Collaborating 
with de Laski, Simply Jeff, Moontribe's DJ Brian Gollub, and LA producer 
Brian Saitzyk, Kelley pushed out a growing catalog of vital productions, 
including the brooding beauty, "Rapture at Sea." In 2004, while Kelley 
advanced his production chops, he made a more visible return to the 
DJcircuit in anticipation of techno's current revival.

Elysium - Inner Child and Groove Shop Records

Respected for his enduring role in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland rave scene, 
Brad Thomas, aka Dj Elysium has, in the past eight years, garnered a 
reputation as one of the finest house DJs in the tri-state area.

It wasn.t long into Brad.s DJing career, that promoters, both national 
and local, were interested in placing Brad along sides the likes of acts 
like; Carl Cox, Bad Boy Bill, and Charles Feelgood. Over the years, 
Brad.s sound evolved to include many forms of house including: funky, 
disco, speed garage, 2-step, vocal, jazzy, hard UK, and booty. His 
musical influences include Titonton Duvante, Feelgood, Bad boy Bill, 
Eric Morillo, MJ Cole, and DJ Sneak.

In recent years, Brad has continued to maintain his busy schedule of 
performing including: multiple long-term club residencies, special 
events and numerous raves.

Elysium has always been ahead of the game, as a performer and artist. 
After moving to Pittsburgh in the summer of 2002, Thomas shifted his 
musical focus to production. Although he still maintains a rigorous 
performing schedule, Thomas can also be found working hard in the studio 
with production partner DJ 7up. The two have collaborated on numerous 
releases for Jes One.s Groove Shop records of Chicago, as well as 
projects with Patrick Norman of Rusted Root.

Fri Nov 04                        D-BRIDGE                        Cleveland

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

MIX. ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY w/ HABERSHAM | Abbasso | Cleveland | 
Saturday 10.08.05

HABERSHAM (Blueprint, Global Underground, Audio Therapy)
http://www.blueprintsounds.com

The two minds behind Blueprint Recordings are those of Damon 
Fonooni and Brett Abramson, known in the music industry as 
Habersham and Numinous. Although both come from two very different 
backgrounds, Habersham's roots originating in the UK, and Numinous 
coming out of the early Florida house and progressive scene, they 
both share varied musical influences. These include jazz, classic 
soul and funk, such as Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, Prince, an "Off 
The Wall" Michael Jackson and George Clinton/P-Funk, to Radiohead, 
Nine Inch Nails and early Renaissance house.

Each has been DJing for more than six years and producing original 
music for nearly as long. Together they play varied sounds from 
funky and groovey to deep and headfuck, from techy and tribal to 
melodic and breaky, all of which revolves around their roots in 
house music. Habersham and Numinous' Blueprint club night in 
Atlanta has gained recognition across the globe as being one of 
the only consistent and next-level dance music experiences in the 
Southeastern US, bringing in such groundbreaking artists as Phil 
K, Ashley Casselle, Chris Micali and Ali Ajami.

The music of Blueprint Recordings has already received support 
from Sasha, Sander Kleinenberg, Chris Fortier, Jimmy Van M, Phil 
K, Timo Maas, Martin Villeneuve (MV/Envy), Christopher Lawrence, 
Dave Ralph, Barry Gilbey, Kasey Taylor, Jonathan Ojeda, the 
Scumfrog, Dave Dresden and many, many more. It's house music with 
a subtle funkiness and a deep and dirty edge. The sound of 
Blueprint borrows from classic progressive elements and fuses them 
with quirky sounds of the future, while never losing its ability 
to stimulate the mind and the feet.

No matter the differentiating styles of music you may hear from 
Blueprint, there will always be one constant: pushing minds 
forward and breaking down genre barriers. Conformity:beware.

across from Gray's Armory, and go down the steps***

That's cool! We got a simlar article in the same section for Sloppy Seconds,
think just 2 pages later. They included a picture of Illy, though it has him
listed as Bailey...among other goodf-upz. Typical. I'd scan it, but im kinda
tired now...and I don?t really think anyone on here will learn anythng new.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kill tiesto (taken off Ravetrash)

I saw Tiesto out in Charlotte last year.  I'm not a very big fan of trance. 
Those damn people were getting off on him.  The staff was cool as shit; but I
didn't care too much for the crowd.  Neither did my cousin.  He nearly took a
guy out that night.  I felt a lil' sorry for him.  He can't stand trance, and
he's a bit on the prejudice side.  The venue was the "superclub" of Charlotte. 
I'll let you use your imagination with the crowd.  We were all thugged-out and
shit, and it was obvious we didn't fit in with the snobby-ass crowd &
high-priced hoes.  The DJs in the other room were spinning trance/breakbeats. 
I stayed in there for a lot of the night.  Those guys were from South Carolina.

Subject: {pb-cle} Sloppy Seconds review

Heya guys..

Wanted to say it was nice to see everyone last night. I know I 
couldnt hang out with most of you guys like I wished, but Bailey and 
I have been friends for some years now, and he wanted to hang out and 
make me feed him drinks the entire night. I did try getting down on 
the dance floor with a lot of you.

The night was an over all good turn out. Wasn't sure why the crowd 
wasn't feeling his tunes. He didn't play as hard as we know he can 
play, so I kind a feel like that had something to do with it. I kept 
getting people asking me last night to "tell your boy to start 
mashing down the jams". I'm just happy he didn't come thru with to 
many anthem top 40 hits from the UK.

Thanks to all the guys from 412dnb and everyone else that came in 
from out of town. Hope everything was proper for you guys as well.

Bailey would like to know if anyone had pictures of last night that 
he could view. He had fun despite the hard time trying to get the 
crowd off their feet.

There's so many things I'd like to continue posting here, but my ass 
is super tired and I'm going to take a nap.

=)

Jes.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} more san francisco stuff....

Just wanted to say THANKS for the SAN FRAN suggestions!

I stopped at Reverb and actually found a few good records - Ragga /
Break Core.  Ameba was huge, not much dnb that I could find; lots of
house / electronica though.  The Citrus Club was phenominal, very good
selection of Thai ;)  Dub Tribe layed it down.  They had digital
technics and did live vocals.  Good to hear them as always.  Stopped
by compression the local dnb weekly; very nice sound system.  Found a
Rouge bar, so many many kinds of Roage beer on tap!  I do have to say
that the China Town and plethera sushi resterant makes that an awsome
town alone.  Could walk everywhere, like room temperature all day and
night outside, by far Cleveland or Pittsburg have nothing on that
city.  I recomend checking out the seals on the PIER 39 if ever in the
area.  Federal law permits humans from getting cought giving them hugs

I just read a book called "Under the Banner of Heaven"

i haven't downloaded any of the video, so i dont know if this is any
different than the one posted last night....

Here is the video footage:

http://homepage.mac.com/apexgrin/FileSharing2.html



Knick of Evol intent puts the night's events into his own words::

Last night, I was booked to play an event about an hour outside of Salt
Lake City, Utah. The hype behind this show was huge, they presold 700
tickets and they expected up to 3,000 people total. The promoters did an
amazing job with the show.. they even made slipmats with the flyers on
them to promote in local shops.

So, we got to the show around 11:15 or so and it was really cool. It was
all outdoors, in a valley surrounded by huge mountains. They had an
amazing light show flashing on to a mountain behind the site, the sound
was booming, the crowd was about 1500 people thick and everything just
seemed too good to be true really. Well...

At about 11:30 or so, I was standing behind the stage talking with someone
when I noticed a helicopter pulling over one of the mountain tops. I
jokingly said "Oh look, here comes big brother" to the person I was with.
I wasn't far off.

The helicopter dipped lower and lower and started shining its lights on
the crowd. I was kind of in awe and just sat and watched this thing circle
us for a minute. As I looked back towards the crowd I saw a guy dressed in
camoflauge walking by, toting an assault rifle. At this point, everyone
was fully aware of what was going on . A few "troops" rushed the stage and
cut the sound off and started yelling that everyone "get the fuck out of
here or go to jail". This is where it got really sticky.

No one resisted. That's for sure. They had police dogs raiding the crowd
of people and I saw a dog signal out a guy who obviously had some drugs on
him. The soldiers attacked the guy (4 of them on 1), and kicked him a few
times in the ribs and had their knees in his back and sides. As they were
cuffing him, there was about 1000 kids trying to leave in the backdrop,
peacefully. Next thing I know, A can of fucking TEAR GAS is launched into
the crowd. People are running and screaming at this point. Girls are
crying, guys are cussing... bad scene.

Now, this is all I saw with my own eyes, but I heard plenty of other
accounts of the night. Now this isnt gossip I heard from some candy raver,
these are instances cited straight out of the promoters mouth..

- One of the promoters friends (a very small female) was attacked by one
of the police dogs. As she struggled to get away from it, the police
tackled her. 3 grown men proceeded to KICK HER IN THE STOMACH.

- The police confiscated 3 video tapes in total. People were trying to
document what was happening out there. The police saw one guy filming and
ran after him, tackled him and his camera fell, and luckily.. his friend
grabbed it and ran and got away. priceless footage. That's not all though.
Out of 1,500 people, there's sure to be more footage.

- The police were rounding up the staff of the party and the main promoter
went up to them with the permit for the show and said "here, I have the
permit." The police then said, "no you don't" and ripped the permit out of
his hand. Then, they put an assault rifle to his forehead and said "get
the fuck out of here right now."



Now.. let's get the facts straight here.

This event was 100% legal. They had every permit the city told them they
needed. They had a 2 MILLION DOLLAR insurance policy for the event. They
had liscenced security guards at the gates confiscating any alcohol or
drugs found upon entry (yes, they searched every car on the way in). Oh, I
suppose I should mention that they arrested all the security guards for
possession.

Oh another interesting fact.. the police did not have a warrant. The owner
of the land already has a lawsuit against the city for something similar.
A few months ago, she rented her land for a party and the police raided
that as well. And catch this, the police forced her to LEAVE HER OWN
PERSONAL PROPERTY. That's right. They didnt arrest her, but made her leave
her own property!!!

Don't get it twisted, this is all going down in probably THE most
conservative state in the USA. And this is scary.. a gross violation of
our civil liberties. The police wanted this party shut down, so they made
it happen. Even though everything about this event was legal. The
promoters spent over $ 20,000 on this show and did everything they had to
to make it legit, only to have it taken away from them by a group of
radical neo-con's with an agenda.

This was one of the scariest things I have ever witnessed in person. I
can't even begin to describe how surreal it was. Helicopters, assault
rifles, tear gas, camoflauge-wearing soldiers.... why? Was that really
necessary?

This needs to be big news across the USofA. At least in our music scene
(edm as a whole)... this could happen to any of us at any time. When we're
losing the right to gather peacefully, we're also letting the police set a
standard of what we can get away with. And I think that's BULLSHIT!

The system fucked up last night... They broke up a party that was 100%
legal and they physically hurt a lot of people there at the same time. The
promoters already have 6 lawsuits ready to file with their lawyers and the
ACLU is already involved.

I'm sure some pictures (and hopefully some video) will surface soon. I'll
make sure to post them up here on 404, so you can see the Police State of
America at work.

UTAH PARTY I WAS PLAYING AT .... SAD

sad, and disturbed at what happened. Here is more info and thank you all
for your kind words.......please spread this all around and write letters
so we can be heard and fight this.

Ravers mauled by K-9s, beat up by police, CAMERAS CONFISCATED & DESTROYED,
SWAT brandishing ASSAULT RIFLES, women KICK IN THE STOMACH by cops, TEAR
GAS dispersed!

OK, I sent my letter to the sheriff department's PR guy, Sgt. Dennis  
Harris (ucso.dennis@state.ut.us) and I encourage y'all to do the   same. 
I'm sure I'll be branded as a terrorist and have my phone   tapped and my
house raided shortly but hey, it's worth it to rattle   the cage a little
bit.  Maybe if enough people send well-worded
letters of inquiry to this guy they'll start to feel the heat.
Anyway, here's what I wrote.  Hope you enjoy it...Oh, Trout, please  
forward to pb-cle-raves:

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} utah raid by swat team

They had Fox News on where I was for lunch today, you can only guess 
which way they were spinning this story. I've seen them take that same 
point before, but they were really for busting ravers with sticks and such.

I really didn't see if they mentioned Utah or not, all I saw was a 
"THESE KIDS ARE CRIMINALS" kinda story, without specifics, but then 
again, I really was trying to eat my lunch.

Oh yeah, boycott myspace people. For real. Using myspace = a tool for FN 
to understand culture so they can eradicate and control it. In case you 
haven't heard, Fox owns myspace.

Now, before anyone accuses me of being a bleeding heart liberal, a baby 
killer, or whatnot, I'd feel the same if Air America, or anyone else 
pulled this stunt. I am all for privacy.

how does fox owning it help them understand culture any more than if they
didn't?  those pages are all on the web, and can be spidered just like any
other?  i do see some of my friends scrambling to other FOAF sites, so
we'll see where things go down the road.....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} utah raid by swat team

As someone who has lived thru the rave raid and been
arrested (flint, Mi), I can honestly say that the 116
people and I that were innocent are very thankful that
the ACLU picked up our cases. If you wanna give money
to someone  give it to them. The ACLUs job is to
protect everybodys civil liberties. If any of those
kids out in Utah were wrongfully charged or arrested
than that's who they should call.

As far as my space goes...........Dude our "culture"
has been documented in books and is easily accessible
to anyone who wants to look hard enough, including the
all seeing global cooperate government. Myspace is a
great networking tool and a great way to find friends
you haven't seen in a while. I would like to see some
proof of fox owning that site, bring it if you got it.

"News Corporation announced today that it signed a definitive agreement
to acquire Intermix Media, Inc. for approximately $580 million in cash,
or the equivalent of $12 per common share. In a separate transaction,
Intermix announced today that it exercised its option to acquire the 47
percent of MySpace.com that it does not already own. MySpace.com is the
leading lifestyle portal for networking online. Both MySpace.com and
Intermixs more than 30 sites will become part of News Corporations
newly formed Fox Interactive Media unit."

if our culture has ANYTHING to do with what goes on on myspace,
we're in much bigger trouble than newscorp could put us in.

HAHAHAHA, how true.

And the people who raided the Utah leftover jam were there because of Joe  
Biden, a DEMOCRAT.  The conservatives over at Fox (like myself) have  
better things to do than to kick around a dead culture for kicks.

So yeah, "boycott MySpace" cause Fox is watching you!  hahahaa, it'll free  
up the servers  :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Swat issue talked about

that was insane, guess at one point they had triple the number of  
listeners that made the streams suck.  I tried ripping the audio but  
I haven't heard it yet, and I just realized they archive it, without  
the commercials.  Just found it funny I had no idea what this talk  
show was, and didn't know about till 8:30, and by the end of show  
it's spread around that three times as many listeners were listening  
to it.  This has gotten me so pissed off, as I'm sure a lot of people  
are right now.  But it's like being in a soundproof booth.  You yell  
for someone to hear you, and no one does.  I don't know how many  
times at work, where I've mentioned I've gone to raves (actually it  
was more like "i go to parties", "what kind of parties?", "raves",  
"ohh, that's where they do drugs?" (actual conversation I've had  
several times in the past)).  I really am at a loss of words for  
this.  RAVES DOES NOT FUCKING EQUAL DRUGS!!  People do drugs at  
raves, but they also do them at concerts, bars, clubs, schools  
(gasp!), households and anywhere else.

Archive should be listed at http://www.freetalklive.com/index.php   
sometime shortly

This will probably be the only big coverage they'll be,  
unfortunately, at least with a bias towards the party goers where  
everywhere else is going to lean towards the feds.  Unfortunately I  
see this just be another thing like that party that got busted around  
here a month or two ago.  People first see, get pissed, bitch and  
moan, nothing gets done, and nothing ever happens.  I fucking hate  
this country now more than ever.  The world should just do itself a  
favor and nuke this whole place.

I am ashamed to be an american.

Man....this is so absurd.  Someone should be held
responsible for this.  I can not believe they sent in
troops to break up a legal event.  How the hell did
the super authorities find out about this party?  How
much money was wasted on materials to break it up and
finally what the fuck is going on in this world?

That video just really pissed me off.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Swat issue talked about

I'm actually glad they started rambling on about the Kent State 
incident that happened in the 70's, because it's going to happen 
really soon if these guys think they have the power that they do.

It just seems to me, that there HAS to be some huge reason for this 
bust. There are easier ways to stop events from happening, but for it 
to go down this way, is totally insane. I'd really love to see 
Hookaville get broken up like this.

Yeah no doubt.. this whole thing has me sick to my stomach.. I missed the 
broadcast so I can't wait for the archive to be ready.. I was in shock to 
see the news had nothing to say at all here last night.. actually not that 
shocked.. what is this country coming to. I called my friend Terrence Parker 
(Detroit DJ.. a.k.a.- TP) and he was surprised also.. said he was gonna 
contact some of his affiliates. He just got back from a tour in Japan and is 
still really connected since the Detroit Techno thing started in his time.. 
Can't wait to see what spins off from all this.. hopefully enough people 
will be outraged that the media will finally get involved..

i find it almost comical that everyone is so outraged. they made
raves completely illegal in britain fucking 11 years ago, yet they
still have a better dance scene than we have here. people there
were pissed but they got on with it. this has been coming for a
long long time.

doesn't part of the "definition of rave" require or at least encourage some
sort of illegal or otherwise transgression-based activity?

how does 1) a legal event 2)with a permit 3)at a secured venue qualify as a
"rave". i thought that was a concert.

you guys confuse me.

It has everything to do with the way it was handled Tom. You and I 
both know that there's other ways to handle issues like this.

I don't even really associate myself with outdoor events anymore to 
be honest. They've all been wrecked in some shape or form from my experience.

That's why I wanted to call into the station myself... and just 
basically state that the real definition of the word "Rave" has 
nothing to do with how they are run these days. The term has just 
been passed down..

come on, dude. cops may be assholes but theyre not fucking
retarded. you can try to play games with the name of what was
going on all you want, but it doesnt matter. they know what it is,
and they know they dont like it. and they know theyll do whatever
it takes to stop it, no matter what you call it.

im not excusing anyone from their actions. its possible to do
really stupid legal things. for example, its perfectly legal for a
white person to walk unarmed into the hill district and call the
black people there the "n word". what would happen to him
certainly wouldnt be right, but you can understand why it happened.

Dude if that's the case. I want all Hooka Fests to fucking die.

It pisses me off to no end to know these assholes do the same drugs 
the rave culture did at one time, if not worse. You never hear of 
these events getting shut down like this. Give me a break....

George Noory on Coast to Coast mentioned the events that went down and
how he thought it might become a national story.

Considering it was in Utah, hicks cops playing soldier dress-up for
fun is my best guess at how that much excess of force could sound like
a good idea.  Doesn't sound like anyone got seriously hurt or killed,
so my guess is they will allow the ends to justify the means.

It is strange that as hard as i try, I can't imagine a rock fest being
raided with automatic riffles.  Yet a rave being raided like that
seems completely feasible.  I must be brainwashed.

To bad the ravers didn't snap there candy bracelets and glowsticks
together and form one giant raver voltron and take em on.

people are afraid of what happens in the dark. seriously. if you
make it not all night, that changes many many things about it in
peoples minds. does it make sense? hell no. does that matter to
the retards who sit in their suburban homes and think about this
shit? hell no. theyve certainly never worried about making sense
before.

Thank your country for that. Guess who's taking over brother....

the same people that said we had a voice.. the same people that said 
we have freedom.

I'll be fucking damned before I have children that have to face the 
future that's in store for the rest of us, and that's the fucking 
truth with me right now.

never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever.

Nick is correct.  This issue is a regional issue based on historical 
trends of power abuse in Utah.  I hope that this bullshit brings more 
negative attention to the theocratic "Utards".
But it won't because our president loves violence in the name of peace.
 
You won't see assault rifles breaking up a party in Cleveland, Seattle, 
or Denver anytime soon.
However tear gas might come into play.

What the fuck are you talking about?  This raid that happened on Saturday,
LIKE I JUST SAID, is at least indirectly, if not DIRECTLY, related to the
RAVE Act.  The RAVE Act was thought up by, written by, and sponsored by, a
horrible man named Joe Biden (who wants to run for President in 2008,
btw.  Oh, and he's been caught plagarizing Winston Churchill publicy, of
all people).  It was Joe Biden who "decided" that water bottles are "drug
paraphenalia" or whatever the specifics are, and then made it law.

There's just one catch to all you America/Bush bashers out there.  Joe
Biden is a DEMOCRAT.  Yup, and he's not a sane Democrat like Zell Miller
or Toby Keith, he's right "up" there with Kerry, Moore, Hillary, and the
rest of that diseased herd.  Are you surprised?  You shouldn't be.  If the
country was left up them, we would need to get a special  government
permit every time we went to the bathroom, or ate an apple, or whatever.
And in the "spirit" of another leftist lunatic, those people breaking up
the rave would have ACTUALLY been U.S. Military, a la Janet Reno.

Get a clue, man.

Read a book my man.
The Utah state government sides with whichever party fits in theocratic needs.
Republican vs. Democrat is your ignorant little role playing game, not mine you stupid fuck.
 
"Under the Banner of Heaven" by John Krakaur is a good place to start.

The irony of your ignorance is that Utah is a Mormon state.
Joseph Smith is their prophet, not Jesus.  Mormons killed Christian settlers in the West.
Look up Mountain Meadows Massacre on Google.
 
Fuck Utah, and Fuck You.

one to cradle Mormonism, unless I missed someone.

You've missed everything so far.
Utah doesn't care about politics further than how it serves the Book of Mormon.
The US goverment went to war with Utah (with thousands of troops) in the 1850's over its lack of regard for federal law (polygamy, tax evasion, violence toward gentile settlers).
 
This Utah "National Guard" that raided this party was following a pattern of violence
that has been a part of Utah's hitory since Brigham Young founded the theocratic state.
Their actions are based in relgious doctrines, and since the "Rave Act" supports their religion, they act on it.   Scary what people will do for god.....but not surprising.

Yeah the thing about this bust that bothers me the most is the fact
that it took a whole lot of effort on the part of whoever was at the
bottom of busting up the event.  It was an hour out of the way in the
middle of nowhere.  And what further bothers me is the uniforms they
wore to bust the event.  It was camo!  What happened to just being in
regular police uniform?

Gee whiz

I'm so glad entropy always has something to say. Because he reminds me
everyday why I want to move to Canada. Sometimes I think there is hope
for America, but then something like this happens. Freedom in America
is only for Rich, White, Christian, Republican, Men.<br><br><div><span clas=

you are ignorant...they arent catering to a politco...they are just doing
what they've always wanted to do...now with the rave act...they have the
means to do it...this stuff would only fly in utah and maybe a few other
states cuz of the ultra-conservative core there....regardless of which party
controlls the state...its an ultra-conservative place...where the average
land-owner probably has 100acres plus...those kinds of places tend to be
super conservative, cuz those people dont want anyone fucking with their
land.

Yes, you're probably right, but they did their homework - or atleast
they say they did in retrospect and they didn't just go storming into
the party looking for drugs - they did infact go under the pretense of
the promoter missing a permit.  If this wasn't the case, it probably
still would have gotten busted, but probably a bit later and the
articles would have attributed it to undercover agents buying or being
asked for drugs.

http://sltrib.com/utah/ci_2964938

Near the end of the article:=20

"Saturday's party, named Versus II, had been tracked by police for
several weeks, Gilbert said. Police planned the bust when they
discovered that the rave's promoters had not filed for a mass
gathering permit through the County Commission office.

To have more than 250 at an event without that permit is a violation
of the law, Gilbert said.

Party promotor Brandon Fullmer said he purchased a mass gathering
permit through the Utah County Health Department about three weeks
ago. The purchase of that permit, which ensures water, sanitation and
medical services, was confirmed by County Health employee Jay Stone.

Fullmer did not know that a similar permit, which requires a security
plan and event details, needed to be acquired.

The sheriff had little sympathy for the promoters or those at the
rave. "They did nothing more than ensure this was a venue for illegal
drug use and consumption," Tracy said. Officers confiscated ecstasy,
marijuana, alcohol, cocaine and mushrooms, he said"

from what ive heard...all the permits were in order...so when the aclu
finally sorts this whole thing out in court...i have a feeling the promoter
is going to get a big settlement from the state to keep this whole thing
quiet...if the police went in there illegally none of this will stand up in
court.

my real concern is for the innocents in this...the people that brought out

Yes, you're probably right, but they did their homework - or atleast
they say they did in retrospect and they didn't just go storming into
the party looking for drugs - they did infact go under the pretense of
the promoter missing a permit.  If this wasn't the case, it probably
still would have gotten busted, but probably a bit later and the
articles would have attributed it to undercover agents buying or being
asked for drugs.

http://sltrib.com/utah/ci_2964938

Near the end of the article:

"Saturday's party, named Versus II, had been tracked by police for
several weeks, Gilbert said. Police planned the bust when they
discovered that the rave's promoters had not filed for a mass
gathering permit through the County Commission office.

To have more than 250 at an event without that permit is a violation
of the law, Gilbert said.

Party promotor Brandon Fullmer said he purchased a mass gathering
permit through the Utah County Health Department about three weeks
ago. The purchase of that permit, which ensures water, sanitation and
medical services, was confirmed by County Health employee Jay Stone.

Fullmer did not know that a similar permit, which requires a security
plan and event details, needed to be acquired.

The sheriff had little sympathy for the promoters or those at the
rave. "They did nothing more than ensure this was a venue for illegal
drug use and consumption," Tracy said. Officers confiscated ecstasy,
marijuana, alcohol, cocaine and mushrooms, he said"

happened in Yoo-tah.

Heard from where though, sources? Links??  the promoter himself? Did
he upload copies of his permits online?  I'm sure those attending the
party all read the permits that were displayed.  What about receipts
for purchase of the permits - records, etc.  According to what's
stated in the article, it would be very foolish of the authorities to
state they planned the raid under the assumption of a missing permit
if they couldn't prove it was not applied for or granted.

Both sides seem to have facts muddled by media hype, anger, resentment, etc=
.

But yes, wait for the showdown in court to see what turns up.  I hope
the article is wrong about the missing permit, really I do..  If so, I
can see charges easily dismissed / case dropped, but recouping lost
damages with the albatross of the RAVE Act and the fact it's in
Yoo-tah would be a long shot.

Yoo-tah is about as embarrasing to the U.S. as AOL and Scientology.

Yeah, I may be all laid back and easy going, but those cops try to  
take my camera from me and watch how nice I become, wether you're  
toting a rifle or not, and this camera is worth petty cash compared  
to the sound and lighting equipment there. (sure resisting a guy with  
a rifle is not the smartest thing in the world, but I would be so  
enraged at that point it wouldn't matter, plus have them shoot  
someone and see how fast this hits national news)

I guess the next day when people came back to get their stuff their  
was equipment all over the place, so who knows if they actually took  
the cameras and destroyed them or if they just threw them on the  
ground.  And at least at these parties /most/ people have enough  
respect for other's property that people wouldn't touch it.  Although  
I've seen plenty of incidents that go against that, too.

congratulations.

every time i think you've said the dumbest thing you're ever going to say,
every time i think you're at your reactionary-neocon-batshit-craziest...

you just reach deep down inside and pull out another fist-full of stupid.

and then, as if to put the cherry on top of the sundae, you quote senator

you're a giver, entropy. don't let anyone take that away from ya.

The rave-permit is a rave-myth.  Much like the moon is made of cheese.

Subject: {pb-cle} chicago party raid

I was at an outdoor party in Chicago in that was raided by SWAT.  It 
was a Vibeonauts party (1996?).  Officers dropping from helicopters 
wearing body armor.  Dogs.  Closed everyone in the gates for a few 
hours.  After a quick once over they let all attendees go.

The whole party seemed like a setup.  The ticket was purchased at a 
map point 1 hour from the actual venue.  There were supposed to be 4 
or 5 sound stages.  Only saw one maybe two.  And the stages that were 
running were a joke.

Well that explains a lot.

The gub'mint thought it was an insurgency.

We'll be seeing some of the performers down at Guantanamo Bay, entertaining the other "enemy combatants."

Heh.  Didn't see that one coming  ;)

I guess you can now figure out why the dnb scene has made me so frustrated  
over the past 10 years.  It took them what, 7 years, since I figured out  
that 80s, mashups, and postmodernism in jungle were interesting and worth  
spending time on, and even, dare I say, "cool"?

Thanks for the link.  I'll go have myself a listen to Ham N Cheesestep now  
and be happy that after all these years, someone finally gets it besides  
myself.


heh

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Aug 26                          PLUSH                        Pittsburgh

Plush @ Mynt Presents - John Kelley 8-26-05

26 August 2005

John Kelley - Moonshine, Ball of Wax, www.djjohnkelley.com - California

In 1993, John Kelley began DJing at California's full moon desert
gatherings. Fusing the instrumental sounds of house, techno and 
breakbeat into a hard, tribal, psychedelic style that won him fans and 
critical raves throughout the 1990s, Kelley also displayed his skills to 
a national audience through a host of successful DJ mix albums, 
including the Funky Desert Breaks series and the High Desert Soundsystem 
series. In the late '90s Kelley traveled all over North America and 
toured with Orbital and The Crystal Method as the official DJ of 1999's 
Community Service Tour. With more critically acclaimed mix CDs, 
including his United DJs of America entry, Kelley began touring 
internationally in 2000, hitting Central America, Japan, Southeast Asia 
and Australia.

The beginning of a new decade also brought Kelley's first music 
productions, including El Mirage's "Tribal Divide," a Simply Jeff 
colaboration with "Jello Jigglin'" and the bittersweet gem "Rapture At 
Sea" with Eastern Sun. Famous for his eclectic tastes, generous spirit 
and natural ability to rock a dance floor, DJ John Kelley learned his 
love for techno and house music in the heyday of the LA rave underground 
of the early '90s. Attending legendary warehouse parties like 
Aphrodite's Temple of Love and religiously following DJ Doc Martin week 
after week to the seminal Flammable Liquid, Kelley inherited the 
cultural spirit of the underground while being inspired by the ethos of 
some of the world's best underground DJs. Within three years, Kelley's 
underground reputationleadto a higher profile, a relationship with 
Moonshine Music bringing snapshots of his music journeys to an eager and 
growing following. In 1996, Kelley debuted with "Funky Desert Breaks,"
now an underground cult classic that showcased his skills and sound to a
wider, unsuspecting audience. In 1997, "Funky Desert Breaks 2" charted a 
more progressive direction, but easily connected with the growing North
American rave scene. A transition in Kelley's sound began with 1998's
refreshing "Knee Deep," a less serious and more club-friendly mix of 
house, techno, trance and breakbeat. With 1999's "High Desert 
Soundsystem" and 2000's "High Desert Soundsystem 2," Kelley retained his 
desert roots while displaying a growing taste for global trends, 
compressed together in exciting and vibrant combinations.
United DJs of America 19" followed in 2001 to critical acclaim, and was
nominated at 2002's Winter Music Conference as one of the best DJ mix 
albums of 2001.

In 2002, after a busy schedule touring internationally, Kelley
began to focus on writing his own music. Scaling back his DJ 
engagements, he also started the Ball of Waxx music production company 
with his friend David de Laski, LA's Lord Runningclam. Collaborating 
with de Laski, Simply Jeff, Moontribe's DJ Brian Gollub, and LA producer 
Brian Saitzyk, Kelley pushed out a growing catalog of vital productions, 
including the brooding beauty, "Rapture at Sea." In 2004, while Kelley 
advanced his production chops, he made a more visible return to the 
DJcircuit in anticipation of techno's current revival.

Elysium - Inner Child and Groove Shop Records

Respected for his enduring role in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland rave scene, 
Brad Thomas, aka Dj Elysium has, in the past eight years, garnered a 
reputation as one of the finest house DJs in the tri-state area.

It wasn.t long into Brad.s DJing career, that promoters, both national 
and local, were interested in placing Brad along sides the likes of acts 
like; Carl Cox, Bad Boy Bill, and Charles Feelgood. Over the years, 
Brad.s sound evolved to include many forms of house including: funky, 
disco, speed garage, 2-step, vocal, jazzy, hard UK, and booty. His 
musical influences include Titonton Duvante, Feelgood, Bad boy Bill, 
Eric Morillo, MJ Cole, and DJ Sneak.

In recent years, Brad has continued to maintain his busy schedule of 
performing including: multiple long-term club residencies, special 
events and numerous raves.

Elysium has always been ahead of the game, as a performer and artist. 
After moving to Pittsburgh in the summer of 2002, Thomas shifted his 
musical focus to production. Although he still maintains a rigorous 
performing schedule, Thomas can also be found working hard in the studio 
with production partner DJ 7up. The two have collaborated on numerous 
releases for Jes One.s Groove Shop records of Chicago, as well as 
projects with Patrick Norman of Rusted Root.

S.O.S.

submerged (live PA) - nyc dnb
(ohm resistance, subtitles, obliterati)

Its hard not to feel the impact of Submerged, be it his work with the
legendary Bill Laswell, remixing Herbie Hancock for Sony, or founding
one of the most influential stateside drum n bass labels (ohm
resistance). Also co-founder of the Obliterati label, Submerged has
carved his name in the stone wall of music history with the help of
radio airplay, releases on countless labels, and support from some of
the biggest names in electronic music. Fresh off a US and two European
tours, Submerged will land in Columbus Ohio on 8/26! You don.t want to
miss this rare live PA set of the amazing drum n bass he has become
world renowned for.


temulent - detroit dnb
(ohm resistance, obliterati, canvas, bassdrive, los luchadors de muerto)

Father of the Obliterati imprint and founding member of Ohm Resistance .
the name Temulent has become synonymous with the no-holds-barred,
near-death drum and bass that he has been spinning and producing for
almost a decade. Fans of his sound can expect nothing less than his
trademark landscapes of bleak paranoia and unabashed aggression. 
Temulent is coming to destroy Columbus in true Ohm Resistance style.


enduser - germany dnb/breakcore
(outbreak, ohm resistance, ad noiseam, sonicterror, too many to list)

With the help of radio play from John Peel, Bailey, and the Breezeblock

top names in the hardcore and drum n bass worlds, Lynn Standafer's
musical juggernaut has landed spots working with artists like The Bug,
Panacea, Needlesharing, Soundmurderer, Resonant Evil, NYC hardcore band
Terror, and many others. His recorded output has become the stuff of
legend on respected cult labels such as Ant-Zen, Mirex, Ad Noiseam, The
Bug's Razor's X, and UK drum and bass leader Outbreak. In addition to
Enduser's prodigious output, Standafer is also producing music for
Acclaim US, scoring independent films, and operating his own
experimental drum and bass label, Sonicterror Records

Sat Oct 08                 MIX 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Cleveland

MIX. ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY w/ HABERSHAM | Abbasso | Cleveland | 
Saturday 10.08.05

HABERSHAM (Blueprint, Global Underground, Audio Therapy)
http://www.blueprintsounds.com

The two minds behind Blueprint Recordings are those of Damon 
Fonooni and Brett Abramson, known in the music industry as 
Habersham and Numinous. Although both come from two very different 
backgrounds, Habersham's roots originating in the UK, and Numinous 
coming out of the early Florida house and progressive scene, they 
both share varied musical influences. These include jazz, classic 
soul and funk, such as Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, Prince, an "Off 
The Wall" Michael Jackson and George Clinton/P-Funk, to Radiohead, 
Nine Inch Nails and early Renaissance house.

Each has been DJing for more than six years and producing original 
music for nearly as long. Together they play varied sounds from 
funky and groovey to deep and headfuck, from techy and tribal to 
melodic and breaky, all of which revolves around their roots in 
house music. Habersham and Numinous' Blueprint club night in 
Atlanta has gained recognition across the globe as being one of 
the only consistent and next-level dance music experiences in the 
Southeastern US, bringing in such groundbreaking artists as Phil 
K, Ashley Casselle, Chris Micali and Ali Ajami.

The music of Blueprint Recordings has already received support 
from Sasha, Sander Kleinenberg, Chris Fortier, Jimmy Van M, Phil 
K, Timo Maas, Martin Villeneuve (MV/Envy), Christopher Lawrence, 
Dave Ralph, Barry Gilbey, Kasey Taylor, Jonathan Ojeda, the 
Scumfrog, Dave Dresden and many, many more. It's house music with 
a subtle funkiness and a deep and dirty edge. The sound of 
Blueprint borrows from classic progressive elements and fuses them 
with quirky sounds of the future, while never losing its ability 
to stimulate the mind and the feet.

No matter the differentiating styles of music you may hear from 
Blueprint, there will always be one constant: pushing minds 
forward and breaking down genre barriers. Conformity:beware.

Fri Nov 04                        D-BRIDGE                        Cleveland

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

Subject: {pb-cle} more on the utah ordeal

Now is the time for action friends, we cannot let this faschist behavior
continue!!!! Do what u can even if it is only to warn a few people of the
possible violations of rights and personal freedoms that HAVE HAPPENED and
COULD QUITE POSSIBLY AGAIN HAPPEN IF NOTHING IS DONE ABOUT IT! So ask
yourself this, will u stand by and watch our rights as they blow away in
the wind or will u take action!!!!!!!!!!!


Official Statement and Information from the Promoters of Versus.

First off, we would like to thank all of the people who have come to our
side in the wake of this deplorable incident. We apologize for not being
able to provide you all with information faster. We are doing everything
we can for people who were affected by the actions of the police. We as
community have been underestimated. The finger has been waved about our
character and ability. Because of this, now is the time to stand up
together and show the world exactly how we dont plan to take this lying
down and teach a couple old dogs a thing or two about what character is.
So, this is what we need to do


To put a stop to any rumors, or false statements that have been cropping
up, we would like to clarify a couple of key issues.

* Was the party permitted?

Yes, period, end of story. Now for the reason this has been in question:
According to the county laws

(http://www.utahcountyonline.com/app...ATTY/Chap13.pdf)

in Section 13-4-2-1:


Required.

No person shall permit, maintain, promote, conduct,
advertise, act as entrepreneur, undertake, organize,
manage, or sell or give tickets to an actual or
reasonably anticipated assembly of two hundred fifty
(250) or more people which continues or can
reasonably be expected to continue for twelve (12) or
more consecutive hours, whether on public or private
property unless a license to hold the assembly has
first been issued by the County Commissioners. (Ord.
No. 1971-4, Section 2, 7-7-71) (emphasis added)



It states that if the party was to exceed 250 people OR go over 12
consecutive hours we would have needed to clear it with the county
commissioner.


The FACT is, that although the party was to exceed 250 people, it was NOT
to go over 12 hours. This is evidenced by the DJs time slots, and the
agreement between Performance Audio and Brandon Fullmer. The permit was
granted, and then seized by the Utah County police, clearly stated across
the top Utah County Health Department Mass Gathering Permit.

It was not made clear by any employee of Utah County or member of the Utah
County Sheriffs Depatment at any time prior to the event that anything
else may have been required by law.

* Were any individuals injured by the police?

This should be self-evident that this statement is true. However, the
issue needs to be addressed. The police have stated that no one was
injured. There is photo and video evidence to prove otherwise. This
evidence will be coming out in the press conference, which will be
occurring soon.

* Did the police use tazers?

Tazers were not used; however we have sufficient evidence and reason to
believe that STUN guns were present and allegedly used.

* Were dogs used to subdue party goers?

Yes, the K-9 units were present, and used in this operation. We have
testimonials and evidence to show that the dogs were used as frightening
motivational tools in evacuating the area plus you can distinctly hear
them in the video.

* Were cameras and videos broken or confiscated by the police?

This is true. We will provide photos and provide the actual cameras that
were destroyed in the operation at the press conference.

* Was Brandon Fullmer involved in promoting the event called Sequence?

No. For both Versus and Sequence, there is a promoter involved named
Brandon, however, they are NOT the same person. No question. This is being
addressed because the Utah County Sheriffs department seems to believe
these individuals are the same, when in fact they are not


* Did the police officers find any weapons?

Yes, the police did arrest and charge one person with possession of a
firearm. This individual in question was the land owners son, on his own
property.

* Did the police seize large amounts of drugs?

Police did seize illicit drugs; a large portion of the drugs seized were
drugs that the security officers had confiscated from event goers.
Admittedly, this is a sticky issue. Police say security should not have
those substances, but it is securitys job to keep the environment as safe
as possible from potential harmful situations.

* What are our feelings about police presence at these events?

Many times past we have hired off duty police officers to patrol and
attend these events as added security. There have also been many times
where police have come, and have walked through our parties. Had the
police even attempted to contact us before hand, they would have been a
welcome presence.

* Was this event a secret, only for people in the know?

ABSOLUTELY not! This event was in no way, shape or form a secret. It was a
highly publicized and promoted event. If this event had been a secret, or
a covert operation in any way, why were great lengths taken to obtain
permits? This event was no secret.

What are we as promoters doing about this situation?



1.We are currently working with legal representation to ensure we do not
get steamrolled by Utah County. We are working with Brian M. Barnard who
is considered to be one, if not the best civil rights attorney in the
state of Utah.

2.We have set up the web-site www.Music-Versus-Guns.org. This is taking a
bit longer than expected to set up the site properly due to the large
amount of interest in this situation. However, we are in the process of
making this a centralized site with information on a multitude of issues
pertaining to this particular incident. Please visit this site to learn
more about what happened and what you can do.

3. We are spending almost every waking hour to discuss this issue at
length with members of the media. We are trying to make sure that the
events of August 20th 2005 are reported on fairly. We are also trying to
educate as many people as possible of the true nature of these events,
this is difficult but we are working with a host of excellent reporters to
make sure the facts are strait.

Obviously, this is a lot of work, which is why we need your help and
continued support.


What can you do?



There are many different priorities with regards to what needs to happen,
and we would appreciate whatever help you can give in these areas.



1. If you attended the event and were allegedly attacked or assaulted by
the police.
You are priority NUMBER ONE right now. This is what we need from you
immediately:

a. We need written statements with explicit detail about everything.
>From the time you left your home, to when you got back home. Please try to
leave all speculation and personal opinions out of it. JUST THE FACTS!!!
Also, keep them as professional as possible; if you are not confident in
your writing skills, there are individuals who can assist you with this.
Leave your contact information and FULL name at the bottom; along with
addresses, phone numbers, email, etc. Contact information will not be made
public!

Please send these statements to: Dimitri801@comcast.net

Many of you have already written eloquent and detailed descriptions of
your night; thank you so much! We just ask that you add and/or edit
anything that may need it.

b. We ARE be willing to videotape these statements as well.

Your experiences of the evening are the heart of this matter and we know
that this may be a hard matter to discuss but the world needs to know that
you are a real person with a serious grievance. If you are interested and
willing to do this, please contact Dimitri at: (801) 577-8281 or by email
Dimitri801@comcast.net

We will require each individuals consent to post or use any of this material.

c. Most importantly if you took photos of any injuries, WE NEED COPIES
immediately!
There is a good guideline on how to document these injuries here:

http://www.flora.org/legal/legal_info/document_injuries.html -and-
http://www.fleschnerlaw.com/infolin...TING%20INJURIES

if you have not already done this. Bruises fade; cuts and wounds heal, and
the sooner this is captured the better off everyone is. If you did not
file a police report for any of your grievances out of intimidation or
fear; do it now, with them or the ACLU at: http://www.acluutah.org/ There
is a form located on the website where you can electronically file a
complaint against the police. The police seem to be very curious as to why
no one is willing to come in and report any alleged trauma or police
brutality to the police; please be sure to include any of your reasons
when you do this.


What if I made it out of the event unharmed and wasnt harrased?


1. Congratulations, you are lucky.

However, you are still an eyewitness account of what happened, and we need
it. Once again, we are not interested in if you think the police involved
are unscrupulous and/or immoral, with the intent of maliciously stomping
on individuals civil liberties. All we want are the FACTS about what you
saw. We need these accounts to directly refute the lies the police keep
reporting to the media. We have already caught some of their inaccuracies,
and need to keep doing just that. Please state everything that happened
the second you left home until the time you returned home. Include
everything you can, who was with you, times, and details. The sooner you
do this the better!!Just like wounds, memories fade  hop on this people!
Please include your full name and contact information; name, date,
telephone/fax numbers, addresses and send these statements to

Dimitri801@comcast.net or- nadia_73@hotmail.com



2. Talk far and wide.

Do everything in your power to make sure every human being on the face of
the planet hears you. This is not just about an event, it is about freedom
and civil liberties; it is also about the police overstepping their bounds
and justifying it however they please. Once you start talking do not ever
shut up. If this is what happens today, and people stay silent, what will
the police think they can get away with tomorrow? Silence will encourage
their negative behavior.


To the people who were not in attendance



1. Be it local or international, it does not matter; WE NEED YOUR HELP!
Not only to spread the truthful word about what happened, but to do
whatever possible thing you can assist us with. People in the media,
public relations, internet related business, people who can provide
additional legal help, financial assistance, or people willing to help
with leg work are of great necessity to us, please contact
Loki801@comcast.net or- Dimitri801@comcast.net All other music and event
lovers keep talking! You have our never ending gratitude, you guys are so
amazing!

Ultimately to prevent something like this ever happening again, it is up
to ALL OF US. We must have teamwork and solidarity  having unity goes
without saying. This fight is neither going to be short nor easy; we want
to ensure that it is not you who needs our help someday. In order to have
good teamwork, we need to be able to communicate so please visit the
website, do what you can do, and please feel free to contact the people
below as needed.

It's an OR statement, not an AND statement.  It went over 250 people, so  
you needed the permit, even if it was a 1 hour party.

Ignorance of the law is no excuse.


The rest of the below spin doesn't matter, since they broke the law.

Yeah, except he's probably right, for better or worse.  But his fact
checking is, uh, slim.

Forwarding this one around, from DCRaves. =20

------------------------------------

a local dj and pretty decent guy, did his own
investigating...here is what he found out by talking to the cops :)

full thread here:
http://www.buzzlife.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3D62975

Final information gathering on the Utah Rave situation:

Since I was unable to get Utah County Sheriff's Department Public
Information Officer for the Spanish Fork Canyon incident on the phone
(3 voice mails, no returned calls), I asked the Sheriff's Office
receptionist if there was anyone else that I could speak to about
these events. Lo and behold, I was transferred to Sheriff Tracy
himself. Many of you that will read this will likely be skeptical to
say the least, but I found the Sheriff to be remarkably calm,
well-spoken, direct, and--my impression--frank about the actions of
the 20th, providing some additional helpful backstory that helps me to
piece much of this together. Sheriff Tracy responded to questions that
I asked about the events of the night, which seems to paint a picture
to me that is fairly clear:

1. The landowner Cody Bernell Childs (Trudy Childs would appear to be
his mother, and may be the deed holder on the land in question) spoke
with the Sheriff's Department AND the Commissioner's Office prior to
the party and inquired about the additional Mass Gathering Permit.
According to the Sheriff, he was told by both parties that the permit
was required. Here's where it gets weird: Mr. Childs never applied for
the permit. Why would someone go in specifically seeking information
about the permit and not fill out the application? Did Mr. Childs
deceive the promoters and tell them that it wasn't needed or simply
fail to communicate what he had learned? Or, perhaps, did Mr. Childs
report back to the promoters about the requirement and the promoter
dropped the ball? Then the other question has to be why did
Commissioner White fail to inform me that Mr. Childs had come by and
asked about the permit?

2. Sheriff Tracy shed some light on the incident that was referenced
as having occurred some weeks ago at the same location. Apparently, in
this incident, weapons were found on persons and on the grounds
(apparently abandoned by people fleeing the scene). While the number
of weapons is actually quite small (4), this does provide some logic
for the military-like response of the officers. What's odd, though, is
that if you check the arrest history of Cody Childs, you only see one
arrest in Utah County other than for the night in question occurring
on 28 March 2005 for a variety of charges including the posession of a
firearm--which would only be prohibited if Mr. Childs had felony
convictions elsewhere--and a variety of drug charges. Why he would not
have been shown as booked in the incident reported as "3 weeks ago" by
Sheriff Tracy is unclear.

3. Factoid on arrests that I wasn't previously aware: when "arrests"
are made, the vernacular is referring to the number of actual charges
filed against one or more persons. Therefore, the 60+ "arrests" that
were made were charges filed against 23 individuals.

4. Tracy reported that he was at the scene during the raid. He says
that tear gas was not used. He explained that what witnesses saw was
more likely dust from the helicopter being kicked up from the low
flight pattern. The tactical teams were outfitted for crowd control,
did have bean bag shooters, did have SWAT "tanks", and did have
tazers. None of these items was deemed necessary for use and were not
deployed save one "near tazering" of a man fleeing the scene in an
automobile under the influence. The man pulled over prior to the use
of the tazer. Sheriff Tracy says that precisely 3 people were taken
"to the dirt" during the raid. He stated that the persons subdued were
done so with knees on their chests. The female that is shown going
down in the video that we've likely all seen apparently started
kicking officers, which was not captured on film. He went on to say
that attack dogs were not used and were not "sicked" on party goers.

4. I asked Sheriff Tracy about the issues that, frankly, were nearest
and dearest to my heart: violations of due process by officers. He
stated that officers became aware of the party via flyers, purchased
tickets and received map point instructions like all other paying
attendees. Undercovers went to the party, observed illegal activities,
and called in the calvary. He stated that ticket stubs and flyers have
been admitted as evidence copies of which could only be released to
attorneys doing discovery. Similarly, the folder of permits, business
plans and other information that was "handed over by event security to
officers" had also been admitted to evidence.

5. I asked Sheriff Tracy about specifics on the 17 year-old girl that
was treated for an "MDMA overdose" at the scene and released to her
parents. Most of us know that an overdose like this is both hard to
come by and impossible to treat without hospitalization, so how was
the young girl treated. Apparently, the celebrations of having "saved
the girl's life" are somewhat overblown. The girl was presented to
site EMTs contracted by the event (apparently employed by the Spanish
Fork City Rescue Squad) with a pulserate of 176 (I get WAY over that
just being on the eliptical trainer at the gym and I'm 30...so
what!?). The parents of the girl were advised to take the girl to the
hospital for further treatment, but there's no information as to
whether or not that actually happened.

6. Sheriff Tracy provided some insight at the conclusion of our
onversation that I found to be most interesting. First, remember the
2AM caberet laws in Salt Lake City? In Utah County you can't dance
after 1AM. So, even if every permit in the book had been filed, no
drugs and no underage drinking were involved, the party could have
been shut down at 1AM regardless. Sheriff Tracy stated that he felt it
was appropriate that people lobby the Board of Commissioners to change
the caberet law as it is the county's legislative body. He said
(paraphrasing here...) that, "There's nothing fundamentally wrong with
having a rave or a punk rock concert or a rap concert or whatever you
want to do." He agreed that regardless of the public gathering a
certain amount of crime was to be expected, but if promoters would
work with his department, involve them in the planning, and have them
at the event that they could more easily hold individuals responsible
for their illegal actions rather than shutting down entire events.

Welcome to the lesson to be learned from this.  if
you're going to do shit on this scale that the
author-i-tays are going to find out about anyway, they
damn well better find out from you and there better be
some back-scratching involved (e.g. paying off-duty
cops to do security...why do you think they are at so
many clubs?)
