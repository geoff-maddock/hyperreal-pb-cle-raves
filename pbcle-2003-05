matthew 18

3 verily i say unto you, except ye
be converted, and become as little
children, ye shall not enter into the
kingdom of heaven.

4 whosoever therefore shall humble himself
as this little child, the same is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven

5 and whoso shall recieve one such little 
child in my name recieveth me

6 but whoso shall offend one of these little
ones which believe in me, it were better for
him that a millstone were hanged about his
neck, and that he were drowned in the depth
of the sea.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

SATURDAY MAY 3rd, 2003

DJ SMASH
(BLUE NOTE, NYC)
www.bluenote.com
www.djsmash.net

DJ Smash's current involvement as conceptual director and producer with 
Blue Note Records only hints the range of his experience and talent for 
bringing together diverse elements within the realm of Dance music.

Starting his journey into sound in the late 70's as Disco swept NYC (and 
the world), Smash found his calling via the turntables and the inventionof 
the 12" single. Being too young to gain entry to nightclubs, his first 
gigs were blockparties and basement jams (featuring the occasional dj 
battle) in his hometown of Brooklyn. With the emergence of rap, his skills 
were sharpened while working with local neighborhood MCs and the 
relationships soon evolved to producing tracks and "battle tapes" for 
various MC contests and demos. 

As the rap game became more commercial, competitive and violent, Smash 
sought out other musical forms to express his diverse taste and 
creativity. House music was the next major musical influence and inspired 
him to become more prolific in the studio working with singers and 
musicians in replacement of rappers. After shopping numerous demos the 
payoff was being signed to the trend setting dance label Sleeping Bag in 
the late eighties. He produced several songs for other artists on the 
label but longed to release his own records. As that was 
about to become a reality, Sleeping Bag went under which spurred him to 
take his untried sounds elsewhere. 

As a result, his first releases as an artist were for the ground breaking, 
New York City underground dance label Nu Groove Records. "Cutting my first 
3 records with no censorship or musical discrimination from a label was 
such a blessing to me" says Smash. "Karen and Frank (Mendez) were risk 
takers and way ahead of there time for a New York label. Being able to 
learn the business as I went along yet being given the respect and freedom 
to find my own way musically really planted the bug in my head to start my 
own label like I saw Kenny Dope and Bobby Konders do with them". 

After Nu Groove dissolved in 1991, Smash teamed up with an investor and 
started Eightball Records producing the first 5 releases under different 
monikers like Jazz Not Jazz and Jazzy Grooves while signing and 
co-producing Napoleon Solo's cult funk hit "Come On Girl" as well as 
producer Fred Jorio's Lectroluv Project. 

After creative conflicts with their Eightball partner, Smash and new 
partner Asia Love founded a new imprint specifically focused on the 
growing global phenomenon of the 'Acid'Jazz and Trip Hop movement. They 
called it New Breed Records and it featured a diverse roster of talent 
from around the globe. For most of the artists, namely Lisa Shaw, The 
Prunes, Hustlers of Culture, Peanut Butter Wolf, Tommy Gurerro and 
Khromozome Project, it was their first record deal and a testing ground 
for new and unusual ideas. The label had a six year run (1991-1997) as one 
of the premiere Acid Jazz and break beat imprints out of New York with a 
focus on signing and nurturing talent rather than licensing in tracks, 
which most other labels chasing the trend chose to do. 

With over 30 remixes and 75 original released productions to his credit, 
working with the likes of Roy Ayers, Herbie Hancock, Towa Tei, Guru and 
Donald Byrd among others, Smash has traversed the creative boundaries of 
the music business with clever and innovative appropriations of differing 
styles, at times blurring the lines of what's considered house, hip hop, 
jazz, reggae, dub, and funk. His legendary NYC residencies have included 
Save The Robots, Nell's, and Giant Step as well as numerous guest stints 
at various bars,lounges, clubs and festivals internationally.

After a short stint in the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to
the electronic dance scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture.

anything else you might throw on the ground.This is a beautiful venue 
surrounded by a state park,so try to keep everything nice looking. This 
venue is in the middle of no where and all permits have or will be taken

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)

The time is 1200 hours the date is 10/18/03 and the location is Pittsburgh 
PA.  The company that brought you a revolutionary event is now back to 
bring you the much-anticipated sequel to a phenomenon that began 1 year 
ago.  We gave much thought about how we could improve our event from last 
year and we decided to eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes 
brutal outdoors so we moved the legacy that started it all indoors into a 
beautiful large facility located in the heart of the steel city. We wanted 
to assure everyone’s safety this year and keep our show as a one of kind 
superstar import car event.  Even though we wont be racing vehicles this 
year there will be tons of fun, and many different creative things going 
on.  I will have to keep you in suspense about most of the activities that 
we have planned until the time is right but I will give you brief taste of 
what is in store for SO2.  Picture an event like you have never witnessed 
before lights, visuals, sound, lasers, dancers, djs, mc’s, models, free 
stuff, contests, entertainers, many different automobile divisions, tons 
of cash prizes, a outdoor portion and indoor portion, and much more TBA!  
If you thought that Street Outlawz was as good as gets you won’t believe 
your eyes when SO2 hits the city. So prepare yourself for an event that 
will once again go down into the history of the Steel City!


ELECTRONIC MUSIC:
	(These are only a few of the major headliners that will be 
featured at the event please stay posted to our website 
www.steelcityracing.com for more detailed information)

DRUM N BASS:

FREAKY FLOW w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone can’t get enough of 
his outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If it’s not 
magazines then it’s live TV the Freaky Flow combination has truly been 
just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didn’t have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!




UFO! (Drum N Bass)
(Phracktel/ Phunckateck/ Phylum Recordings-SF)

The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!  Please don’t be alarmed by 
the name the aliens are not really coming.  However this is just one more 
incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he his mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that 
whenever he drops his dubs the dance floor will be screaming for more.  If 
you hadn’t had the chance to see this west coast legend then allow 
yourself the time to hit the dance floor at SO2 for an unforgettable 
musical experience!

AND MORE TBA!

HAPPY HARDCORE!

*Unfortunately we cannot disclose this highly confidential information at 
this time.  However we can say this what is coming is so big that all you

once in the lifetime opportunity!


TRANCE

concerning this major headliner however we promise that you won’t be 
disappointed!  Keep in touch with our website to find out further updates

RYAN MATTHEWS-(Trance/Progressive Trance)
If it’s trance that you love then you won’t want to miss this outstanding 
Pittsburgh native by the name of Ryan Matthews.  This young superstar 
tears up the dance floor every time he hits the decks playing an 
outstanding selection of emotional and heart pounding trance that leaves 
you in a state of pure euphoria.  

E-DITTY- (Trance)
The dark haired maniac is back again he’s the player hater that you all 
love to hate!  But we keep bringing him back because of his prestigious 
mixing skills and loving attitude towards the music that he spins.  If you

special set!

fantastic very rare all live performance.  This is another do not miss 
performer that adds to our obvious love for electronic music!

AND MORE TBA!

TWO STEP

Cheshire w/Mc Gravity-(2-step/Warren OH)
We gave much thought to this and we decided to choose one performer to 
strictly represent the 2 step scene and this performer is no other than 
the one the only DJ Cheshire! Chris a.k.a Cheshire is a one of kind 
performer his smooth intellectual attitude gives his style a unique 
separation that blows up dance floors every time he hits the stage.  The 
love of his music is obvious with the energy that he displays every time 
he drops another funky beat. We couldn’t get enough of this incredible

Jazz be Jazz?

Jazz be born out of early American music; opera, military marching bands, 
folk music, the blues, church music, ragtime and African drumming. A 
blending of all these came to be known as Jazz. Jazz be swinging in synch, 
it be improvising the sound of light, it be an expression of freedom, 
whether it be standard, avant-garde, ballads or be-bop, Jazz Be Jazz!

What is Mini M?

MINI m’s are miniature music festivals to test the waters and answer the 
question, is Pittsburgh ready for an International Music/Performance 
Festival along the likes of SXSW, and the Philly Fringe. What makes these 
festivals miniature, is that they are only for 2 days, whereas, most 
Festivals occur over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. MINI m’s focus on 
Pittsburgh’s regional talent in a concentrated manner. Our second 
festival, Jazz Be Jazz, will feature Pittsburgh’s emerging and established 
artists, creating momentum for a new community based jazz festival in the 
city's east end.
 

The
Mini-M Jazz Be Jazz
Festival

keep your good vibes strong!

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -

no really it means:

Subject: {pb-cle} HeadRush / Penton / this weekend /  Summer Series

Hi -- I get the digest and not the individual messages. Sorry for not
responding sooner, but I just saw this!

On Saturday May 3, Penton will be going on around midnight or after; we're
giving him flexibility. I'm sure he'll be hanging out with us before he goes
on the decks, so don't miss the chance to talk to him, especially if you
have production questions. The party starts at 9pm with Abbasso's Jay
Schamberg opening and Pittsburgh's Osmotic (twin/innerchild) warming up for
Penton. Deviant (HeadRush Music) will tie up the evening nicely with some
dreamy stuff. The party doesn't end until 5am...

I hope everyone in Cleveland enjoyed the Penton interview on 91.1FM WRUW on
Monday! Did you guys like the premiere of his tracks or what????

Regarding Max Graham: He was confirmed for the date of June 21 by his agent,
and when we spoke to Max at the Winter Music Conference, he said he was
amped to get out here and play a six-hour set with us. However, starting on
April 18 & 19 with two gigs he had booked for Spundae Chicago and Las Vegas,
he is now unable to enter this country to work. He is a British citizen
living in Canada, and he did not have the proper work papers to play gigs in
the United States. His agents have suspended all bookings and gigs until
late summer/early fall until the US Government clears his work visa status.

I certainly wouldn't, fret, though. We have a great Summer Series lineup
waiting for you. All the gigs will be at Abbasso: Thomas Penton, John
Howard, Steve Porter, Sean Cusick, and more TBA.

This Friday 5/2 at our regular weekly HeadRush ::TRUE:: Friday @Abbasso, DJs
spinning are: Deviant, Darbe, and Jamie Tyler. Fridays are NOT afterhours.
Arrive early: 9pm-2:30am. Shout-out to Chris Eberhart for dropping a good
set last Friday. We interviewed Chris Eberhart, and that's up on our web
site.

Okay! That should do it! Most every other question can probably be answered
by our web site: http://www.headrushmusic.com (dj bios, map, directions,
line-up, etc).

See you this weekend!

Good question, I was wondering when Penton would be playing myself.  e-mail
Amy: amy@headrushmusic.com she should be able to answer that.  I'll try and
find out and post it in the meantime. If you ever do want to check Abbasso
lineups/times though here's some sites of interest... HEADRUSH
MUSIChttp://www.headrushmusic.com Headrush Music are the ones who booked
Penton for this Sat, and do the True Friday events at Abbasso (plug:This
week, Deviant, Darbe and Jamie Tyler), They also have all the info on the
rest of the Summer Series at Abbasso (Max Graham, John Howard)   NITTY
GRITTY FORUMhttp://nittygritty.smartformation.com/default.asp Both Jamie and
Amy post most of the lineupsand times for Fridays and Saturdays as well
details every week on Nitty Gritty's forums  I think info about Dan Petrov's
Warm Art (beginning May 10) at Abbasso is on there now too.  (And of course
all the Nitty Gritty events at Touch are here also) And lastlyBOTTOMS
UP/ABBASSO CLEVELANDhttp://www.bottomsupofcleveland.com/7.html Not really as
up to date, but it has address, contact info, pics. of the bar, etc.. Coming
out Sat. I'm guessing?

Subject: {pb-cle} Lorain "Rave" Bust 

Hey, PB-CLEVers,

As a former Northern Ohioan, I check in periodically. I didn't see anything
on this list commenting on a recent rave bust in Lorain. My parents sent me
an article about it that appeared in the Chronical Telegram. I always hate
to see bad media coverage of my favorite activity, so I am curious whether
this was really even a "rave" or whether it was some other type of  DJ party
giving raves a bad name?

Clearly, I need to "get a life," but in the meantime, I thought I'd drop the
Chronical Telegrama note about the article. Recently, I have ended up being
somewaht of an activist on behalf of raves, and working with my local rave
community and law enforcement to reduce or eliminate drugs at parties, so I
am pretty vocal about this topic. Some of you listees might be interested in
my comments, too, so here is a copy of my letter.

Feel free to reply personally if you have comments as I may not be able to
check the PC-CLE list every day.

-- Robin
aka BPositive
Kansas City

>>Dear Editor,

I used to live in Elyria and like to keep up on the local music scene in
Lorain County. I would like to comment on your recent article in the
Chronicle Telegram called "Rave Raid Nets Drug Charges," on April 22, 2003.

While it is not possible to completely prevent all drug activity at any
public event, including raves, it does sound like there was more the
promoters of the Lorain event could have been doing to reduce or eliminate
the drugs at this event.

Nationwide, the rave community has come together in support of safe, legal
and professional dance events. Most experienced rave promoters realize that
it is their responsibility to ensure that adequate entry search procedures
be instituted, as well as performing ongoing surveillance throughout the
event to detect drug activity. Most rave promoters usually hire security
guards to assist with this. What were the security guards doing at this
event?

The amounts of drugs found on the two people who were arrested were small
enough that they could have been missed in a pre-entry search. However,
sitting around smoking pot would be hard to miss if security or the
promoters were making ongoing security checks through out the event.

Based on the quantities of drugs found on the two arrested were most likely
not major drug dealers, just small time users. Nevertheless, that sounds
like drug activity that could have been prevented. Now a bad taste about
raves has been created in the police's mind, not to mention the people who
read that article.

I don't know how charging $7 a bottle for water proves that drugs are being
used, as Detective Sgt. Rivera alleges in your article. The connection of
high water prices with drug use is one of several rave "myths" being
popularized by overzealous law enforcement officials. At most rave events,
water and other beverages are usually sold by the owner of the venue not the
rave event organizer. Venue owners often make most of their money from
vending food and beverages at the event, rather than from the rental fee for
the hall. The exorbitant prices are due to nothing more than a profit
motive. <<

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ SMASH (Blue Note, NYC) @ NITTY GRITTY THIS SAT

OnPoint Entertainment & Headroom Digital Present:

NITTY GRITTY
the first Saturday of every month, it's all about the party...

www.nittygrittycleveland.com


THIS SATURDAY MAY 3rd, 2003

DJ SMASH
(BLUE NOTE, NYC)
www.bluenote.com
www.djsmash.net

DJ Smash's current involvement as conceptual director and producer with Blue Note Records only hints the range of his experience and talent for bringing together diverse elements within the realm of Dance music.

Starting his journey into sound in the late 70's as Disco swept NYC (and the world), Smash found his calling via the turntables and the inventionof the 12" single. Being too young to gain entry to nightclubs, his first gigs were blockparties and basement jams (featuring the occasional dj battle) in his hometown of Brooklyn. With the emergence of rap, his skills were sharpened while working with local neighborhood MCs and the relationships soon evolved to producing tracks and "battle tapes" for various MC contests and demos. 

His first releases as an artist were for the ground breaking, New York City underground dance label Nu Groove Records. "Cutting my first 3 records with no censorship or musical discrimination from a label was such a blessing to me" says Smash. "Karen and Frank (Mendez) were risk takers and way ahead of there time for a New York label. Being able to learn the business as I went along yet being given the respect and freedom to find my own way musically really planted the bug in my head to start my own label like I saw Kenny Dope and Bobby Konders do with them". 

After Nu Groove dissolved in 1991, Smash teamed up with an investor and started Eightball Records producing the first 5 releases under different monikers like Jazz Not Jazz and Jazzy Grooves while signing and co-producing Napoleon Solo's cult funk hit "Come On Girl" as well as producer Fred Jorio's Lectroluv Project. 

After creative conflicts with their Eightball partner, Smash and new partner Asia Love founded a new imprint specifically focused on the growing global phenomenon of the 'Acid'Jazz and Trip Hop movement. They called it New Breed Records and it featured a diverse roster of talent from around the globe. For most of the artists, namely Lisa Shaw, The Prunes, Hustlers of Culture, Peanut Butter Wolf, Tommy Gurerro and Khromozome Project, it was their first record deal and a testing ground for new and unusual ideas. The label had a six year run (1991-1997) as one of the premiere Acid Jazz and break beat imprints out of New York with a focus on signing and nurturing talent rather than licensing in tracks, which most other labels chasing the trend chose to do. 

With over 30 remixes and 75 original released productions to his credit, working with the likes of Roy Ayers, Herbie Hancock, Towa Tei, Guru, Medeski martin & Wood, Mos Def and Donald Byrd among others, Smash has traversed the creative boundaries of the music business with clever and innovative appropriations of differing styles, at times blurring the lines of what's considered house, hip hop, jazz, reggae, dub, and funk. His legendary NYC residencies have included Save The Robots, Nell's, and Giant Step as well as numerous guest stints at various bars,lounges, clubs and festivals internationally.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Lorain "Rave" Bust 

yes this is true. The article was in the Lorain Journal, aswell as the
Chronical Telegram.

Im also from Elyria, and this has certainly not been the first article they
have written about this venue/events in Lorain. Ive also sent them an email
explaining pretty much the same ordeal on "the scene" it's self, but its the
media,.. and to me they didnt care.

Im glad you wrote them also!..

Hey Guys, I have a friend who is moving from NYC to Pittsburgh to take up her residency at Children's Hospital.. Since I don't know anything about Pittsburgh, I figured I would forward this on to the list. What are names of areas you recommend to live in around the hospital? She heard Shadyside and Squirril Hill.. What are those like? Anyone know any decent apartments for rent in the area? Any help is appreciated :)Roxy

Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are for the money set.

Although, I guess she is in the medical field.

Subject: {pb-cle} new DNB mix - "live @ generator" - mp3/real audio


Hey, a new mix from me is up on:

	http://ratana.chemlab.org

in the mixes section. Enjoy :)

A live set from the Generator club night in Erie, PA from April 10, 2003.
Blunt MC of Faith in DNB is on the mic at times. This is a pretty varied
set, starting off a little funky, getting harder, and then with some
atmospheric stuff at the end - a good build up. A lot of new tunes, and a
bit harder than my sets tend to get usually.

Tracklist:

01. Total Science - Chicken in a Basket - Industry
02. Mathematics - Don't Love Me - Defunked
03. Artificial Intelligence - A1 - V Recordings
04. Calibre - Fire + Water - Soul:R
05. Decoder - Tusk - Tech Itch
06. Kemal + Rob Data - Konspiracy VIP - Industry
07. Cause 4 Concern - Soul (Matrix + Fierce remix) - Cause 4 Concern
08. Ed Rush + Optical - Capsule - Virus
09. Cause 4 Concern + Fierce - Carrier - Quarantine
10. Keaton + Hive - The Plague - Renegade Hardware
11. Tech Itch - Reborn (Weapon remix) - Moving Shadow
12. Usual Suspects - Doorway - Renegade Hardware
13. D. Kay + Rawfull - Be There 4 You - Freak
14. Zed Bias - Something About This - Hospital
15. Big Bud - Way of Life - Good Looking
16. Future Engineers - Rogue Comet - 720
17. Seba - Guidelines - Purified Audio

Obstacles overcome, techno show will go on 
May 2, 2003
BY BRIAN MCCOLLUM
FREE PRESS POP MUSIC WRITER

Thanks to a late-hour rally by the Detroit music community, the Movement techno festival is a go -- if by the skin of its teeth. 

THE FESTIVAL 
What: Movement 2003 â€” Detroit's Electronic Music Festival

Date: May 24-26

Location: Hart Plaza

Admission: Free

Lineup announcement: 2 p.m. today. Go to www.freep.com late afternoon today

Info: www.movementfestival.com 




With three weeks left until the free Hart Plaza festival, organizers say they've cleared several daunting hurdles -- including no sponsorship cash -- as they head into the homestretch for the Memorial Day weekend event. They're getting a big assist from the festival's lineup of Detroit DJs: All have agreed to perform for free. A schedule of about 70 artists, heavy on Detroit acts, will be announced today at the Detroit Historical Museum. Among the performances expected on the fest's four stages: DJs Jeff Mills, Rolando and Mike Grant, along with a live set by Carl Craig's Detroit Experiment group, which includes veteran jazz players such as Marcus Belgrave. 

Faced with a dragging economy and a war that commenced amid their corporate fund-raising efforts, organizers say they've been scrambling around the clock since being awarded the festival contract in January. With no cash from the City of Detroit and unable to secure sponsorship funds, five full-time staffers have been working without pay at the High Tech Soul production office, housed in the Detroit headquarters of Derrick May's Transmat Records. A crew of about 300 volunteers will staff Hart Plaza during the festival weekend. 

"We knew all the odds were against us, and we're standing pretty tall today, I think, considering that we could have quit months ago," May said. "A lot of people didn't believe, and don't believe, this can happen. We've set about proving them wrong." 

Movement replaces the Detroit Electronic Music Festival (DEMF) on the riverfront May 24-26, a holiday weekend that has become one of the area's signature cultural events, drawing more than a million fans by city estimates. 

May, who helms High Tech Soul, has been paying festival expenses out of pocket. The city's arrangement with the DEMF provided $338,000 annually in city funds to festival producer Pop Culture Media. But no city money was offered in the contract with High Tech Soul, negotiated as Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick embarked on a sweeping campaign to trim Detroit's budget. 

Including the payment to Pop Culture, the city paid out about $1.1 million to stage last year's DEMF, bringing in $710,000 through concession revenue and sponsorships. During its three years, the DEMF had successfully landed substantial financial support from major sponsors such as Ford Motor Co. 

Movement organizers say sponsorships are starting to take shape, but they have not yet produced hard cash. Some are in the form of trade -- for instance, stage equipment in exchange for sponsor billing. 

Mayoral spokesman Jamaine Dickens said Thursday he's confident festival organizers are on track. 

"Based upon our conversations with them, the cutbacks have caused them to be a little creative," he said. "But the comfort level is still strong that at the end of the day it will be an exciting event." 

Dickens noted that Movement will benefit from government services such as police security and tactical support from the recreation department. 

Detroit's techno community has watched nervously since January, at times unsure whether the festival would even happen. 

"It's been their biggest struggle -- the city not giving them money and supporting them," said Gamall Awad, who represents Craig out of his New York office. "That seems to be the fundamental issue. They've suffered because of that." 

May, celebrated as one of techno's founding fathers, reached out to artists personally, beseeching them to perform despite the uncertain finances. He concedes he wasn't able to get all the artists on his wish list. 

Detroit DJ Mike Grant said he agreed to donate his services because he recognizes the festival's importance to the city -- and because now "one of the originators of the music has the reins." 

"Any time you have an opportunity to participate in something that helps you individually, that helps the entire city and the music community, you have to do it," Grant said. 

DJ Buzz Goree likened the rally to the early days of techno, when artists with minimum resources banded together. 

"We knew the budget was limited, so we're donating our skills to show our support," said Goree, who will perform. 

Performance fees at last year's festival varied widely, with some lesser-known DJs making as little as $250 and bigger names fetching $2,000 to $3,000. 

At WDRQ-FM (93.1), a three-year DEMF sponsor, program director Alex Tear said he had early concerns about Movement operations, particularly lack of information from the festival camp. But after meeting with May on Thursday, Tear said his station is on board. 

"We sat down with Derrick May and feel confident it's going to be a success," Tear said. "When you're assembling such a large-scale event, learning your checks and balances, who to approach -- I think they figured all that out quickly considering the time they had. It's a massive project, and they were under the gun." 

Tinku Bhattacharyya, the festival's talent booker, hopes that this year's struggle is an investment in the festival's future. 

"The artists feel if they lose this festival and they lose this platform, how else are they going to get it across to the rest of the world?" she said.

There's really no where nice (or even decent) within walking distance of 
childrens.  Tell her to look for someplace on the busline, because she's 
not going to be able to park.. ANYWHERE.  Shadyside is OK, but stupidly 
expensive. Squirrel hill is nice, but finding an apartment near the busline 
may be tough and finding a place to put your car may be tougher.

Try as hard as you can to dissuade her from moving to this godforsaken city.

I'm not bitter, I live in pittsburgh.

they really should think about setting up a paypal donation site... or
someone should... i'm sure if you spammed all the hyperreal lists one time
with this information, people would be willing to donate some money to the
volunteers for their time...

shit was totally off the hook. last night was the perfect example
of why havana rocks it. soy sos was crushing some brazilian shit,
totally straight up 70s funky jazz shit. the ed umm showed us what
was up with some broken beat and disco music. then jwan hammered
home some more broken beat then some detroit techno and house. it
was off the chain. big ups.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: [pb-cle-ot] NRR Pittsburgh Area Question

i like pittsburgh.  i've seriously considered moving there at least a dozen
times in the last year, i just can find a job there that makes it
financially reasonable for me to do so... i'm getting ready to sign a lease
to live in the bus for another year... i have alot of my friends and my
cakewalk job here... so if anyone knows of a job in pitts that pays 37+ a
year that i can sit at work and download music, watch movies, and chat on
aol all day, let me know...  if i were to move to pittsburgh, I'd probably
want to live in shadyside/liberty/squirrel hill area (like to the east and
northeast of oakland...)  I always like living where it's the same driving
distance to go to one side of town as it is to go to the other side of
town....

Tom you beat me to it.  I was just composing my 'Thanks and Praise'.

Thanks to the Element 5 group; Ashwin for getting things together for the 
opening of the Jazz Be Jazz festival.

Thanks to Soy Sos, Ed Umm and Jwan for the sound.  That Brazilian shit was 
hot.  Gotta love these guys who dig deep in their crates and are not afraid 
to play something a little different.

Thanks to the heads who came out.  We couldn't fit anymore people in the 
place.  You guys drank us out of beer too.

Top 10 Reasons Columbus Owns Pittsburgh. 

10. The night owl from CD101. 
9. Fooooood. All the better restaurants I've seen in Pittsburgh are from
Columbus. Fish Market, etc.
8. More hotties. 
7. Great Economy.
6. Better Cable.
5. Any of the City of Dublin's festivals.
4. It doesn't take 45 minutes to drive to a spot 500 feet from you.
3. You can actually buy beer in quantites smaller than the size of your
head. (I dunno why you'd want to).
2. Birthplace of John Holmes.
1. The city is a circle, you just can't get lost.

i like pittsburgh.  i've seriously considered moving there at least a
dozen times in the last year, i just can find a job there that makes it
financially reasonable for me to do so... i'm getting ready to sign a
lease to live in the bus for another year... i have alot of my friends
and my cakewalk job here... so if anyone knows of a job in pitts that
pays 37+ a year that i can sit at work and download music, watch movies,
and chat on aol all day, let me know...  if i were to move to
pittsburgh, I'd probably want to live in shadyside/liberty/squirrel hill
area (like to the east and northeast of oakland...)  I always like
living where it's the same driving distance to go to one side of town as
it is to go to the other side of town....

Lindy's.  Hyde Park.  The cameron mitchell restaurants have good food,

This may be true, there are alot of hot women, but if you can score in
columbus, you can score 10 times easier in any other city.  Ohio is the home

yeah, but the city is spread out so fucking far that it doesnt matter, you
still drive a half  hour to go from the east side of columbus proper to the
west side going 85 on the highway.

Yeah, but put an out of towner in the campus/downtown areas and watch them
scratch their head with all the one way streets... lol


The things that you forgot about columbus:

The TV media sucks.
365 day construction zone.
We get all the cool test market products, i mean shit, we're a 2 million
person metropolis in the middle of a big field pretty much...
No pro sports teams that matter.
Diversity is our middle name.  There is absolutely everything in columbus,
the only problem is that everything is pretty much mediocre... it serves the
purpose and that's it.
Gallery Hop every first saturday of the month!

And the #1 reason columbus is better than pittsburgh:  The gay community
keeps this fucking place way cleaner than pittsburgh could ever wish to
be... sparkling.  Downtown is something to be proud of, as are the Villages
(german/victorian)

that is definately a let down about columbus, not nearly enough mullets
here, except in grove-tucky, but there is no reason for me to go to
grove-tucky, so i'm left seeing very few mullets...like maybe 1 or 2 a month
if i'm lucky.  remember the mullet list... that was good fun.

Although one can get an excellent education in these areas by merely living

Wow, I almost went to Hiram College.  Didn't strike me as the party =

Although the people who showed me around did introduce me to Guru's =

IMO its the best lineup thus far, very detroit centric with lots
of cool people like ayro, amp fiddler, john arnold, dwele, 3
chairs, etc. plus fucking jeff mills and the old electro people
liqud liquit and ESG. thats just wild. i knew derrick may and crew
would come through with the ill shit. ill finally get to see aril
brikha. i seriously cant think of more than maybe 3-4 people id
like to see added to the list and none of them is really all that
important. what a fucking lineup.

Yeah, i finally got around to getting my pictures online.  As usual, 
you can go to my raves site at http://www.vrillusions.com/raves.shtml 
or go to the direct link:

http://www.vrillusions.com/gallery?currDir=.&jump=shift

I'll have it mirrored on hyperreal once the submission area of the 
picture gallery is up and running again.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DEMF/Movement News - In case anyone's Interested

That lineup looks way more interesting to me than in past year's. Francois
Kevorkian, Ritchie Hawtin (tbc), Rolando and Jeff Mills, are some of the
headliners for cryin' out loud!  A good mix of some house greats and the
best of Detroit talents. I'm especially glad to see Kenny Larkin on the
lineup. I saw him once back in the late '90's and his set blew my mind. I've
been trying to get to see him again ever since then.

Also see alot of names I'm NOT familiar with. What do the 3 Chairs play for
example?

Can anyone recommend any web sites with streaming mix sets from any of those
on the lineup?

IMO its the best lineup thus far, very detroit centric with lots
of cool people like ayro, amp fiddler, john arnold, dwele, 3
chairs, etc. plus fucking jeff mills and the old electro people
liqud liquit and ESG. thats just wild. i knew derrick may and crew
would come through with the ill shit. ill finally get to see aril
brikha. i seriously cant think of more than maybe 3-4 people id
like to see added to the list and none of them is really all that
important. what a fucking lineup.

Subject: {pb-cle} Thomas Penton Review

Amy & David...let me just say WOW!!!  I love you guys!! :)  

I just caught the tail end of Jay's set, but what I heard I enjoyed very much.  
Jason (Osmotic) did a very nice set as well...mixed it up with Progressive and 
TECHNO!! :)  Then there was the all mighty Thomas "Fucking" Penton!!  That man 
just tore that place all up.  Everyone was getting down to his set.  After 
Thomas' was David (Deviant).  I only caught the first couple tracks of his 
set.  

Please forgive me for not staying a little longer, but my legs and feet were 
hurting from all the dancing that I did, and I still can't believe all the 
dancing Chris did with him having injured ribs.  It was good to see that place 
packed.  We'll be out again soon, and we will get together to hang out sometime 
before my wedding.

they picked alot of people who were actually relevant to the
detroit guys influences from way back, which was cool. though no
old chicago guys, that could have been cool, a little mr fingers
or something. 

>Also see alot of names I'm NOT familiar with. What do the 3

3 chairs is detroit "beatdown" house by theo parrish, rich
wilhite, and kenny dixon jr. theyre the shit if youve not heard
their couple 3 chairs releases. 

>Can anyone recommend any web sites with streaming mix sets from

>on the lineup?

get on soulseek, add user "pipecock" to your list then browse my
files. i have huge amounts of mp3s from most of the artists on
this lineup in the techno or electro folders. theres a couple more
unknownish local types playing that ive never heard, but that will
change after this festival. with derrick may's approval, im sure
its all good. seriously, i feel like this is close to the lineup i
myself would have chosen.

Subject: {pb-cle} dj battle / dj workshop

there were a lot of really really solid djs on friday.  i was impressed.  i
think there were 2 first place djs and 4-5 second place djs.  my votes
weren't completely reflected in the outcome.  but, that's the way it goes.

as far as older guys competing..pittsburgh really hasn't ever established a
true 'best dj' via this sort of competition.  there's always talk about who
can do what, but as far as doing it live, there's been the atomic battle and
the access/groove thing on friday.  clearly, mvp holds it down..and he is
technically an excellent dj - his sets flow perfectly.  he's just one of
those guys who has it.  i'd say the next competition should sort out the
person able to compete with mvp.  who knows if kevin will ever come out now
that he's making music.  regardless, having guys like that set the standard
just makes the new guys work harder to be the best.

i was particularly impressed by the good attitudes the battle style djs had.
it was nice seeing the contestants cheering for each other and having fun
with the different sets.  i was really glad to meet sasan - he's definitely
one to watch.  you can totally tell who's invested the time.

late summer and this fall, i'll be organizing a series of dj workshops where
new djs can spend a few hours each week learning about equipment,
techniques, and anything dealing with djing..really.  kevin and dc space are
2 of the guy who will be working on this project.  details soon.

I just want to thank the Headrush crew for a great time on 
Saturday. Osmotic and Thomas Penton rocked the house! I
didn't get to hear the other dj's unfortunately. Thanks
for bringing some phat shit to C-town. Paul Fleetwood, good
to finally meet you bro. I saw alot of old school ravers
out Saturday. I hope this is the trend.  

Peace,
Luke

Paul, Trout, nice meeting you two...hope to see you
out more often as the summer progresses.  I really
enjoyed Osmotic's set, and Penton was pretty much as
expected.  All in all, t'was a really good (not to
mention drunken) night.

Yes, thanks Headrush and Abbasso...very fun night!  It was so much fun to dance the night away.   And I must add it was great to see so many listmembers---Meghan..nice to finally "officially" meet you and Luke, since I've seen you both enough times.  And Paul and Trout, so glad you guys made the drive out...it was really great to meet you guys. And of course, Jbunny, Eberhart, Jamie, Amy etc... and all the people I'm so sorry I am forgetting I'm sure...was great to hang out with you guys.   Not too mention just a ton of other great people made the event, making it that much more fun!

Subject: {pb-cle} TECHNO/CHICAGO HOUSE/HARDCORE RECORDS FOR SALE

I thought some of you might be interested in purchasing some records
from my private collection.  Many of these are hard to find and rare tracks
collected over the past 12 years and played all over the US during my sets.

Most of the records are $3-$3 each with the exception of the records marked
offers, which start at $10. These are not bottom of the barrel tracks.
These records I held back from my first sale last year with the intention
of keeping them in case I would need them.  I have decided that I dont,
and so Im selling them.  If you are into techno, tech-house or chicago house
there are a ton of gems here.

I also have a batch of 15 hardcore classics including early drop bass 
tracks, a technohead compilation, dominator w/ a richie hawtin mix and
old NYC hardcore that I would like to sell as a lot.  

For the record, Im not giving up on spinning, Im all about the breakbeat 
and electro nowadays and these are just records I wont play again.

you can see the full list at
http://www.databank-m.com/records4sale.htm

please contact me @ daniel_h@fuse.net or djoracle@fuse.net and ill help 
you asap!

Subject: {pb-cle} keep it deep shirts

the word on the shirts...

the girl i've used for years for t-shirts has been having health problems and
it ends up she's unable to fill the order.  i found another place last week
and sent them the graphic and info.  shouldn't be much longer.  we'll
definitely have them for deetroit.  now would be a good time to send your
money too - a lot of people haven't.

she fucked up my tab but it's all good I guess.

Im so pissed I didn't post on here before I went to this.  I rarely follow 
the list anymore in favor of bluelight, but I still recognize some names of 
people I would've liked to meet:( thats life I suppose.

I thought all the dj's did a great job and the sound/club layout was very 
impressive.  I'd consider coming back for sure

Subject: {pb-cle} CDG III Round One:  Da Venue and Da DJ's

Hello campers.  It's about that time of year to start talking about what
debauchery will go on when 75 listees get together for the cookout and
tribute to electonic music.  This year as I have stated before, Cook da
Goose will not be held at the notorious party barn as it was for the first 2
years.  This is because I no longer hold residence there and the guys who
live there now are wankers.  I am very open to finding a venue in the
columbus area as well as the northeast ohio area, i think those work best
for getting everyone to the event with fair drive times (read: <3-3.5 hours
from pretty much anyone reading this list)  I have put in requests for some
places here in town and haven't heard much back yet, mainly cause people are
slow to call back on venues that arent high-traffic and slammed with
bookings.  Now I am asking for your help in northeast Ohio to let me know if
you know any suitable and affordable venues for my event.  Has anyone tried
to use the Shirley L McGuire Community Center in Norton for an event?

ALSO If you are a DJ that spun at either of the previous CDG events, you are
first come, first served for this year's lineup, with the same payment being
made:  FREE Food and beverage.  So let me know if you are interested.  All
other interested DJ's, send me an email and let me know that you're
interested.  All others not knowing the event here's your background:

In spring of 2001 a mr diddle and his crew ecstasy productions (not even
shitting about the name) decided to throw an event in Cleveland called
Start.  I was so outraged that this blatant disrespect for the scene was
being made in their promotions, that I decided to throw an event on the same
day, make it free, with free food, free beverages, etc to show off what the
scene is really about, the music and the culture of community.  Cook da
Goose I was fully funded by myself, with not just shitty food being served,
it was all steaks, brats, marinated chicken breasts, as well as dogs and
burgers for all the easy to please.  I provided 1 keg of coors light, 2
liters of grey goose, some captain morgan, some tequilas, some jack daniels,
just about anything alcoholic that people drink was there... as well as
sodas.  My first year was great, it brought out an intimate crowd of about
80-100 people who all had a blast.  The second year completely blew the
doors open on it becoming a full on list reunion, with the same foods being
offered, more sodas this time, some beer and adding some shrimp to the menu
of grilled goodies.  I am proud to throw this event every year regardless of
cost to myself because it's my way of giving back to the scene for the joy
it gives me the other 364 days of the year.  I want to personally thank the
DJ's who have spun in the past as well as lenny mack for providing the sound
last year.  The DJ's were (in order of recollection because i'll be damned
if i can remember the lineups):  Soniq Stylz, Gravity, Skillz, Mike Salamon,
Boompsie, Tom Cox, Ratana, Lemma, Moose, Osmotic, Jason Opalenik (cols, oh -
non listee), and Nick Pierce (athens, oh - non listee).

Also, if you are interested in attending the event, send me an email back
because regardless of where I have it, directions/info will only be emailed
to those who contact me beforehand as to avoid any problems with unwanted
guests/people that dont respect what I am doing.  The event is 21+ due to
alcohol (18+ if you contact me or i know you / can have someone vouch for
your character.

-Goose

	I had read was browsing for the 1st time in a while in Scene and saw 
Peabody's is going to be hosting Rebirth ("Grand opening") on Tuesdays. 
Coincidentally, that is also the same night  and name that it used to 
be in Akron? Is this the same crew (CTN?) that threw/throws the Akron 
weekly, or just Peabody's concert hall?
	I hear Felix da Housecat will be in town in a few, and know the 
following are also listed: Rap (AGAIN), Funk, Craze, Collete, and Joey 
Beltram (tomorrow). This is bad ass big name dj lineup for Cleveland, 
and best (popularity wise) i've seen in a while (though Bad Boy Bill 
himself would have to put a loaded gun to my head to see funk throw 
down a Jumbalaia set).
	Later, and I'll see  everyone thats going out to see Joey tomorrow 
night.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: Thomas Penton Review

It was quite a night! Great seeing pb-cle folks... Paul, Meghan&Chris,
Valerie&Jamie, Luke, Trout ... Also, thanks to the Moda crew for coming out
late to hang at Abbasso ... both David(Deviant)&I and Penton appreciated
your bringing Edgar V and Sammy O out.

The most special moment of the night for me was during Penton's set, when he
played a Chris Lake bootleg, "Look on Your Face," about three tracks before
the end. The lyrics went, "Well I've seen it all before ... / But I live for
the look on your face."

I had taken a break from the dance floor and crowd and had wandered to the
back of the bar into a comfy chair with full view of the dance floor, and
was thinking to myself, "God it's great to see people vibin' this and having
such a great time," and just then (no kidding) the male vocal came in for
the first time, "I live for the look on your face."

It was one of those meaningful "Ah" moments.

Thanks everyone. The place was going off. Glad you had a good time. We live
for the look on your face. :-)

Sonic Foundry makes crap, plain and simple. Acid was original when it 
came out, but I find that they're a lot like the Cakewalk folks these 
days, and not really innovating much. The fact that you have to pay 
extra for the plugins in soundforge to make it actually useful is just 
icing on the crap cake. I have to export WAV then use a real ogg vorbis 
encoder (not their built in shitty BETA codec) or a lame encoder to get 
anything done right.

I got pretty frustrated with trying to do music on a PC for reasons 
like this (amongst many others). Now it's all 
Spark/Live/Reason/Recycle/Traktor/OSX for me.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} [Fwd: [AHOT] Sony buys Sonic Foundry]

acid 4 was a pretty major overhaul....its faster, automatable fx, midi
support, and vsti support all come to mind very quickly...

who actually pays for plugins?

my only complaint with sonic foundry is the lack of support for vst fx...you
have to use a wrapper...which usually sucks ass

Piracy aside, It's more of the point that you have to pay several times 
to get a program to do  what it should have out of the box for the 
extremely high price tag it has in the first place. As far as I'm 
concerned, They make crap ad supported software.

There's really three worlds of music software out there.

1. So powerful, so many options, a lifetime learning curve. See, 
csound, max/msp, etc.
2. Cutting edge ideas, underdeveloped software. Ableton Live, Plogue 
Bidule.
3. Stable, polished software that requires lots of other investments, 
and really doesn't have a lot of innovation. Protools, Cubase, Sonar, 
Anything by Sonic Foundry.

There's a couple of exceptions, like Fruity Studio and Reason (omg, 
reason 2.5 rc 5 is just BUTTAH), but for the most part, we're all still 
better off using hardware. I'll start worrying  when AOL buys KORG. But 
that'll happen when my shit turns purple and tastes like rainbow 
sherbet.

the only thing i think sound forge makes you pay extra for is the mp3
encoder?  compared to wavelab sound forge is a million times
better...wavelab looks pretty...but it lacks alot of sound forge's ease of
use....espcially when you are trying to get samples to stop popping(cuz the
crossing points arent zero'd)

for really serious production...you have to have stability...plain and
simple...it sucks to have to save every 2 mins cuz you are afraid of
crashing...it hinders the flow of work....i dont know much about
csound...but i thought it was like a language to program effects and
synths....personally if i had the money right now to invest in a ballsy mac
id be using digital performer or pro-tools..

fruity and reason are excelent tools....but they have their
limitations....most ppl are to the point where they are rewiring reason into
cubase cuz they want to use a real sequencer and the vsti's they paid tons
of money for(or spent days trying to find)...hardware is good for
somethings...for mixing...yes nothing beats a real mixer....for
keys....nothing beats a real synth....but for sampling and sequencing
software is the way to go...so much faster and easier(imho)....i know lots
of ppl that are just using their samplers as effects units cuz of the
filters on it or as a midi trigger(in the case of mpc's)

btw...korg now owns vestax

what is underdeveloped about Live? i dont have any experience
using it, but i have enough experience hearing people use it to
play live very well that i cant imagine why you would call it
underdeveloped. there are plenty of things to add to it, but it
has a very good use already.

you must be joking. even with no other investment aside from a
soundcard cubase sonar adn protools are ALL MULTITRACKING
RECORDING SETUPS. go price an analogue 32 track recorder and you
tell me how its not innovative to use your computer to blow away
anything youve ever used to record before. thats just silly. and
if you arent going strictly virtual (like me, i have lots of
hardware and acoustic instruments) then you probably have outboard
efx so you dont need to spend all your loot on VST crap.

reason is ill. fruity loops was the worst program id ever seen 4
years ago when i used it. ive heard decent shit made with it since
then, but still. using a combo computer/hardware setup is insanely
powerful, much more so than either one by itself.

place is a pretty broad word, not sure of whether it's defined or not... but
i think governor taft should be imprisoned for allowing the state of ohio to
have people using it as a place to unlawfully use controlled substances.  i
mean, someone could put together a pretty good federal case against all the

I think promoters may be able to side step this by stating the purpose of
their event on the fliers and other promo materials. But I'm not to sure
because I just play a lawyer on TV!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Bush passes Rave Act

it doesnt matter if they state their purpose, it's only if they "make
available for use the place for the purpose of unlawfully using a controlled
substance"... it doesnt say that the EVENT purpose has to be to unlawfully
use a controlled substance, just that they made available a place which
could be used by someone with a purpose of unlawfully using a controlled
substance.  So I see them enforcing this as the patron had the intent to use
the place as a harbour for unlawfully using their drug of choice.  Law
wording is always made for interpretations, challenging laws is when judges
actually have to perceive the intent of the law.  The intent of this law is
obviously to stifle 'historically controversial and dangerous' events.
Read: Raves.  I still meet people to this day that had the average raver
lifespan of 6 months where they went out and did alot of drugs, then
realized they were able to do the same drugs in different settings after
having been introduced to them.  These are the people that have formed the
face of the scene to the point of rave having a negative connotation.  It's
definately not the 'lifers' that dedicate hours of blood, sweat, and tears
to the music, to their events, and to the community education about
'underground' music.

Do drugs on your own time, take the time with me to celebrate the music and
culture.

this law affects mega-parties the most.  I'm sure that Ultraworld <?>
parties and the such would be the targeted areas because it wouldnt be hard

does that mean sole and exclusive purpose of using a controlled substance 
or any incidental use of a controlled substance which might occur on the 
premisis?  if it's the latter, then we'd better close down every club, 
office building and sporting arena in the country.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} [Fwd: [AHOT] Sony buys Sonic Foundry]

That's a pretty good breakdown of the music software industry.  I think for
the true benefit of the software in the 3rd category (or all categories for
that matter) we need to integrate our hardware and software together; not
think of them as separate components.  But hardware isn't the holy grail of
sound design.  There is just as much garbage hardware out there as garbage
software.  It takes time to sift through it all.

I'm even more willing to work with police/law enforcement than i was before
because of this... that way the safety of my guests will be ensured even
more than I could do on my own, as well as the real focus of the event being

Interesting point.  Especially because it seems as though the 
responsibility is recursive, having the organizer, leasee, and owner 
responsible for the actions of people on their premesis.

One problem I see though, I don't know that federal officials have the 
position of "owner, lessee, agent, employee, occupant, or mortgagee" to 
anyplace.  BUT, on the other hand, if they claim that promoters should know 
what is going on at their events, regardless, then the federal and state 
governments should be equally responsible for public parks, very often 
places of VERY flagrant drug use.

I wonder what the "for the purpose of" really means.  If it means for the 
SOLE purpose of, then raves would be    exempt.  If it really means "can be 
used as a ______ despite not being the primary purpose of," then, raves 
would be susceptible.  BUT, on the same train of thought, public parks 
would also be susceptible.  No searches are being done at public parks to 
prevent drug sale, use etc.

I think the first time it is challenged, this law will fall apart.

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP skylab2000 news! 


Once again it's actually been over six months since the last news update 
so, here's the latest exciting skylab2000 news.

In this issue of the news:

  [1]. new FREE downloads ("Shak" is back!)
  [2]. 2001 live set online!
  [3]. hot girls and other new pictures. :)
  [4]. why not share the tracks?
  [5]. chit chat blah blah
  [6]. S E X Y new skylab2000 promo items
  [7]. do you want me?


First, I'm gonna slip some bio info in here for the new folks. Always happy to
have new folks in the scene! Welcome. Scroll down to skip...

   Since 1994, Dennis Barton has been traveling city to city as skylab2000
   playing his brand of hard hitting dance music. skylab2000 is not a DJ. This
   is 100% LIVE, hard driving techno/trance and breaks.

   Los Angeles in home base, but the road is his living room, where most
   weekends he's dragged a small studio of gear off to play an event. New York,
   Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, Vancouver, Puerto Rico, Russia, Hong Kong,
   Turkey and hundreds of small towns and cities.

   Now and again this live energy is recorded and released. The early 12"
   "Auburn" includes remixes by Astralwerk's Gearwhore, and the very first
   remix by LA's Taylor. In the UK, JDJ released additional mixes to a huge
   reaction, including a prestigious spot on Pete Tong's "Essential Selection"
   on London's BBC Radio 1.

   On the giant mp3.com web site, skylab2000's "Rollergirl" became the 
number one
   most down-loaded song overall with almost three quarters of a million 
downloads total.

   You can find skylab2000 tracks on DJ mix CDs by Thomas Michael, DJ Grover,
   Dj Psycho-Bitch (Crobar), John Kelly, Taylor, Sol Brothers, Andrew Galea
   (UK), DJ Keoki and many others.


---------------------------------------------

NOW THE HOT NEWS:

[1]. "Shak" is back!
Back in 2000, when mp3's were new and hot stuff, we put up a track called 
Shak on mp3.com, the biggest music download site. We just wanted to give 
you guys some FREE music. Well, our record company got mad at us, and 
suddenly lawyers were calling me and it was big mess. Not fun!

Now FINALLY, years later, that's all settled and Shak is back online! 
Download it at http://www.mp3.com/skylab2000 before someone else gets mad 
at me!

[2]. new LIVE sets online
While I was putting Shak back online, I found a live skylab2000 set in 
Realaudio from couple of years ago from a show in New York. What the hell, 
why not stick it online? So I did.

Look at http://skylab2000.com under the "audio" menu. Live set from "I have 
a Dream" in NY, Jan 2001. Decent quality, and not a bad set if I dare say 
so myself..

[3]. hot pix!
While you are on the skylab2000 site have a look at the pictures section. 
It used to be mostly images of skylab2000 live, but now we've added 
pictures of hot ravers and club girls taken at some the events we've been 
at lately. I'll be adding more as I get them - there's so many amazing 
looking girls in the scene they really deserve their own page...

[4]. Share em!
If you download skylab2000 songs, why not share em with your friends and 
neighbors?? For now, please feel free to share these mp3.com tracks via 
Kazaa, Morheus etc, to get them out there.
Do you all miss Napster and Audiogalaxy as much as I do?

[5]. interviews
If you are curious about anything skylab2000 related, maybe have a look at 
one of the many  interviews on various web sites. A couple of them are 
reprinted on the skylab2000 site under "interviews and articles". Read 
these at http://skylab2000.com

[6.] Promo crap.
How about skylab2000 t-shirts, mousepads, a wall clock or even skylab2000 
thong underwear!!!
Get these for super low prices at http://skylab2000.com/merch.htm

[7]. Do you want me?
Lastly, for you industry people - we are booking events for the next few 
months and have some choice dates still up for grabs. If you wish to book 
skylab2000, please contact us ASAP.

There are plenty of live shows coming up so check the schedule to see when 
skylab2000 is in your city.

Remixes, licensing, press and interviews are always very welcome as well. 
How fun.


Mission control out! Thanks for reading!!

As usual, check the skylab2000 site for news and other info at:
http://www.skylab2000.com

(If you got this directly and wish to unsub, just let me know. Easy.)

peace

If you like I can give you the number for the place Lenny and I threw Field

Plus theres electric, pavillions, baseball field and the price is really

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Bush passes Rave Act

it depends on the judge i think...if you get a fair and just judge...yes the 
law will probably fall apart...but if you get an ultra-conservative let em 
fry judge..you'll probably be looking at 20 years....of course having a good 
lawyer doesnt hurt

also remember this...if this ever does goto court...it will get appealed all 
the way through to the supreme court...and right now the ultra-conservative 
let em fry types have a majority on the supreme court(hence bushII is our 
president)...and alot of federal judges are neo-cons as well(and former 
politicians i might add, can you say CONFLICT OF INTEREST)...now that the 
republican party has a complete control of the gov't...they are appointing 
lots of new judges that the democrats werent letting through the 
senate...you can expect a tight strangle hold on the federal judicial system 
for many years(cuz federal judges have lifetime terms)

thats not to say the dems arent just as evil, greedy, and hypocritical...a 
good majority of congress voted for this legislation....albiet a good 
majority have admitted to not reading most of the legislation that passes 
their desk

Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CDG III Round One: Da Venue and Da DJ's

Another thing...The place would be perfect for cdg.  The only reason we had 
probs at Field day was because about 1200 more people came then we expected 
too.  We only made 400 flyers for tht party too..  But if you are seriously 
interested in the venue let me know. The inside building wold be excellent 
for a stage and allows barely any sound to be heard outside of it.  Its in 
my own back yard almost so I would be more then willing to help out, 
especially after the good time I had last year.

    we had about 150 people there and still
    had problems.

    the fact of the matter is, the people across
    the street have problems with the noise.

    i could probably book that place again,
    even though we had to shut down at 7am.
    at that point, we only had sound inside - so
    it must have still been a problem. maybe
    because we had wws sound? i dunno...

    i hooked the owners up with all sorts of
    paper products, cups, plates, napkins, garbage
    bags, etc.

If you keep the music restricted to the inside building I dont believe you 
will have a problem.  We also left the owner tons of things he could use and 
left the place cleaner when we left thn it was when we got there.  The only 
reason I cant use it again is because he thought Lenny and I were charging 
like 15 bux to get in and was pissed because we rented it so cheap.  In all 
reality it was a free party but he didnt want to hear that..

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Bush passes Rave Act

The original post is careening towards off topic, so I will make my comments 
brief. I agree with you here Nick. Its getting sicker by the day. The 
Democrats are refusing to rubber stamp all these ultra-conservative 
appointees, but they don't have even a majority of votes. They do however 
have enough strength to keep a filibuster going strong. I think Republicans 
needed to sway something like 8 votes to end the filibuster. Now the 
Republicans are considering SUING to end it!!

If this doesn't mean much to you, it should. It is the biggest no-no there 
is. Government was established in 3 bodies to ensure a sytem of checks and 
balances. If the judicial branch has the power to decide what the 
legislative branch can do, we're simply fucked. Completely fucked. This 
would set a precedent that the executive branch could thus exert control 
over the other two branches. This would result in ultimate control by the 
executive branch. This would result in Bush achieving his goal of becoming 
unopposable dictator.

I would say this could never happen. I also would have said the fiasco in 
Florida could never have happened. I am not really heading anywhere here, I 
am just agreeing that there are many more exciting developments in store for 
us in the future.

From: "Nick S" <hasnoplur@hotmail.com>

...now that the republican party has a complete control of the gov't...they 
are appointing lots of new judges that the democrats werent letting through 
the senate...you can expect a tight strangle hold on the federal judicial 
system for many years(cuz federal judges have lifetime terms)

I totally see how the wording of this law could hold prison wardens

snipping out the parts that mean anything with 'parties':  "manage any place
temporarily as a lessee and make available for use the place for the purpose
of unlawfully using a controlled substance."

place is a pretty broad word, not sure of whether it's defined or not... but
i think governor taft should be imprisoned for allowing the state of ohio to
have people using it as a place to unlawfully use controlled substances.  i
mean, someone could put together a pretty good federal case against all the
governors and the president if they wanted to... but due to the unjust
nature of our government, it only targets the lower class non-elite

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} CDG III Round One: Da Venue and Da DJ's

A hippie fest promoter friend of mine suggested:

http://www.smokeriseranch.com/

Yeah, f'in weird, I know, but she said she was at an event that went
till 7am there, and no one cared. Supposedly there's power etc, but
their site doesn't explain a whole lot about it. There's NO details on
their site other than they have venues. 

There IS a contact button on the site, does anyone dare?

I wouldn't have even suggested it, but if you really think about it, who
can make more obnoxious noise and be more annoying than a large group of
hippies?

If you keep the music restricted to the inside building I dont believe
you 
will have a problem.  We also left the owner tons of things he could use
and 
left the place cleaner when we left thn it was when we got there.  The
only 
reason I cant use it again is because he thought Lenny and I were
charging 
like 15 bux to get in and was pissed because we rented it so cheap.  In
all 
reality it was a free party but he didnt want to hear that..

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Peabody's?

Peabody's has had the Tuesday night thing going on and off since they
bought that venue. It seems like they tend to pick big names that used
to be good DJ's. But sometimes they will bring in somebody I like or
haven't seen. The best thing about the night is it's usually free or
dirt cheap if you're 21+. The worst thing about it is how late the
headliners will go on. 

I'm not sure what's up with the name change to Rebirth. I guess it just
shows the promoter has no idea of other club nights in the area.

After our event, he had offers to rent the place for $1000/night and the
owner told me he didn't even want to consider them.   He has probably =
had
time to cool down since then though.

If it were me, I'd look elsewhere...

Ah, memories. I think Ultimate is the only Sunshine Kids party I made it out to. And I think somewhere in my old saved emails I've got one from Matt telling me that even though I'm a drug-addled idiot, and even though he disliked me immensly, I was not in fact permanently banned from SK events ...those were the days, I tell you ...

hey all,

If I do recall of Entropy.. he was a Happy Hardcore kandi kid who was VERY 
cocky, not to mention a complete hypocrite also.   I'm glad he went to 
jail... one less DJ to play that rotten stuff that makes me want to bang my 
head off a wall... 

and Tricia is right, he would love all tha drama.

Ok... so my brother who lives out in Las Vegas just sent me some local,
"scene" newspapers from out there... I like to check out what they have
going on. And I see an ad for "RA" nightclub in the Luxor, and The Zelch
Brothers were advertised as playing on April 23rd. Did this happen? If
so how did it go? That's impressive!

I don't know anything about that ad but Ben and I were at Club Ra in Oct
and it was $30 a person to get in for a local dj!! It was an okay club,
but we just picked a bad night to go. Hip-Hop night, ew. Oh well, have fun
in LV.

JOHN HOWARD (om records, san francisco)=20

Part Two of the Summer Series 2003

Join us for John's four-hour set.=20

John Howard is a legend in house music. He started DJing in 1993, during =
San Francisco's infamous Summer of Love. John's first regular =
appearances were at Groove Kitchen and the Boogie Buffet with Mark =
Farina. Then on to Stompy Stomp, Together with Dubtribe, Spundae, and =
Wicked.

John's sound is smooth San Fran funk fused with a large dose of Chicago =
style, combined with his own brand of eclectic jazz and Bay Area =
influences. It's always funky and it's always different.

You've heard John rock it on the critically acclaimed SF Sessions Series =
from OM Records. And now he's rising as a producer, with his track =
"Buddha Cowboy" appearing on OM's 100th Release double CD.  Visit =
http://www.headrushmusic.com to listen to a mix set by John Howard and =

Do you think thats because he grew up and lived with it or because he looked

...and in the end, does it make a difference?

I see what you are saying, but that was the wrong way to say it.

You can't tell someone they know music and then call them a moron. That just 
doesn't work.

Call him an asshole instead (or something) - as long as it makes sense...

What a horrible night to have a curse.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

DJ Kos "The Digital Assassin"
Give Me A Break CD Release tour
www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency 
Parkersburg, WV
 
As a long time favorite in the midwest, Kos returns to Columbus with a
vegance in an all new digital format and new music style. After 20 years
behind the turntables, this madman has moved over onto the all new Pioneer
CDJ 800 Digital players. With an all new format, Kos is now able to take
his mixing and scratching skills to a whole new level. This new format
allows Kos to produce his tracks and play them at will. You also ask, what
about the insane scratching Kos use to do? Well we assure you that none of
his live scratching will be lost. This new format sacrifices nothing and
still allows the artist to perform as though he is on vinyl. After years
of mixing it up with house and breaks, Kos has now moved all the way over
into Breaks. This show is long over due and not to be missed!!!!!!!!

Ultra Flash Events, in Conjunction with Brainchild Entertainment
presents "Orgy" Ohio.


"Orgy" May 9th 2003


Special Lineup
Orgy's Naughty Main Room: Trance/House

ARMANN The BRAINCHILD : San Fran
(Brainchild / Orgy / Club RA / Byassn / Just Two)
Known from New York to San Francisco for his unique mix of uplifting
progressive Tech style, edgy trance, and exquisite blending,
Armann the BrainChild is guaranteed to present a performance that will
stir the mind, body and soul. Voted Top 5 DJ/Artist in the US by the
Afterhours. Voted Top 10 DJ/Artist in Canada.

DJ Vicious Vic : New York City, NY
(Topaz / Neurodisc / Lower Bass Prod / Just Two)
Vicious Vic's credentials as a dance music phenomenon are undeniable.
A veteran of the East coast rave scene, he helped give the sound of
the New York underground global recognition by DJing alongside such
East coast luminaries like Frankie Bones, John Debo, Scott Henry,
James Christian, Feel Good, Diesel Boy, Micro,DJ Icey, Bad Boy Bill,
Keoki, Josh Wink and Rabbit in The Moon.


Orgy's Intense Intimate Room :

E-Sassin : Los Angeles, CA (Note:Make Up Date For Heart Attack Feb14)
(SoundSphere / Phunckateck / Just Two)
Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran
of the Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical
journey in the late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and
jazz/fusion bands which helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm.
After a short stint in the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to
the electronic dance scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture.
"Once I started getting into producing dance music,
I finally felt I was on the right track to where I wanted to be musically.
My reputation as a cutting edge producer, and later as a DJ, steadily 
grew,
and so did the work.

DJ 3D : Chicago, IL (Note:Make Up Date For Heart Attack Feb14)
(Uptempo / N20 / DJ3D.Net / Just Two)
Expect the newest and highest quality Drum and Bass selection from
DJ 3D; hard and dark yet dancefloor friendly. This original Chicago
junglist knows his business! 3D has over 17 years experience behind
the decks and has been moving dance-floors since the early 80's.
Labeled "The Godfather of Chicago Drum and Bass", 3D is the pioneer
of American Jungle Producers. The first to ever have his dub-plates
rewound in a UK DJ's set and has out sold any other DJ or Producer in
the USA. A total of over 80 SELF PRODUCED tracks and remixes on
countless labels has gained him world-wide recognition.

Sat Jun 14                          SE7EN                           NE Ohio

On Saturday, June 14th, 2003 Unified Entertainment, Wishing Well, and 
Phareal Productions bring you up to Northeast Ohio again for.........

"SE7EN"

Pride, Anger, Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, and Lust.

These are the things that come between people in general, promoters, 
cities, and different scenes that end up destroying it if it isn't fixed. 
This event will feature djs from all over and the main theme is for us to 
look at what we do every day that might hurt our scene and work on 
changing it. We think that if we can all throw away the bickering and the 
arguing this area of Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Dayton, 
Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Indianapolis, Nashville, and any other 
cities that are involved in our scene every week will be the talk 
everywhere as the places to be or just the Midwest in general.

anything else you might throw on the ground.This is a beautiful venue 
surrounded by a state park,so try to keep everything nice looking. This 
venue is in the middle of no where and all permits have or will be taken

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)

The time is 1200 hours the date is 10/18/03 and the location is Pittsburgh 
PA.  The company that brought you a revolutionary event is now back to 
bring you the much-anticipated sequel to a phenomenon that began 1 year 
ago.  We gave much thought about how we could improve our event from last 
year and we decided to eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes 
brutal outdoors so we moved the legacy that started it all indoors into a 
beautiful large facility located in the heart of the steel city. We wanted 
to assure everyone’s safety this year and keep our show as a one of kind 
superstar import car event.  Even though we wont be racing vehicles this 
year there will be tons of fun, and many different creative things going 
on.  I will have to keep you in suspense about most of the activities that 
we have planned until the time is right but I will give you brief taste of 
what is in store for SO2.  Picture an event like you have never witnessed 
before lights, visuals, sound, lasers, dancers, djs, mc’s, models, free 
stuff, contests, entertainers, many different automobile divisions, tons 
of cash prizes, a outdoor portion and indoor portion, and much more TBA!  
If you thought that Street Outlawz was as good as gets you won’t believe 
your eyes when SO2 hits the city. So prepare yourself for an event that 
will once again go down into the history of the Steel City!


ELECTRONIC MUSIC:
	(These are only a few of the major headliners that will be 
featured at the event please stay posted to our website 
www.steelcityracing.com for more detailed information)

DRUM N BASS:

FREAKY FLOW w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone can’t get enough of 
his outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If it’s not 
magazines then it’s live TV the Freaky Flow combination has truly been 
just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didn’t have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!




UFO! (Drum N Bass)
(Phracktel/ Phunckateck/ Phylum Recordings-SF)

The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!  Please don’t be alarmed by 
the name the aliens are not really coming.  However this is just one more 
incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he his mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that 
whenever he drops his dubs the dance floor will be screaming for more.  If 
you hadn’t had the chance to see this west coast legend then allow 
yourself the time to hit the dance floor at SO2 for an unforgettable 
musical experience!

AND MORE TBA!

HAPPY HARDCORE!

*Unfortunately we cannot disclose this highly confidential information at 
this time.  However we can say this what is coming is so big that all you 
happy hardcore kids better get your whistles ready and start shining them 
early because this headliner is a major ordeal and we promise it to be a 
once in the lifetime opportunity!


TRANCE

*Once again for security reasons we cannot release any information 
concerning this major headliner however we promise that you won’t be 
disappointed!  Keep in touch with our website to find out further updates

RYAN MATTHEWS-(Trance/Progressive Trance)
If it’s trance that you love then you won’t want to miss this outstanding 
Pittsburgh native by the name of Ryan Matthews.  This young superstar 
tears up the dance floor every time he hits the decks playing an 
outstanding selection of emotional and heart pounding trance that leaves 
you in a state of pure euphoria.  

E-DITTY- (Trance)
The dark haired maniac is back again he’s the player hater that you all 
love to hate!  But we keep bringing him back because of his prestigious 
mixing skills and loving attitude towards the music that he spins.  If you 
haven’t seen Eric’s performance before then you won’t to miss this very 
special set!

AND MORE TBA!

possibilities then come experience the 8th wonder of the world on 10-18-03 
when the militia makes a pit stop to the import car scene. Prepare 
yourself to see what four guys, five turntables, and three mixers can 
accomplish when they are put together in one room for 2hrs!

DR. Huxtable-(Live Break Beat PA!)
The doctor is making his return to the import car scene for another 
fantastic very rare all live performance.  This is another do not miss 
performer that adds to our obvious love for electronic music!

AND MORE TBA!

TWO STEP

Cheshire w/Mc Gravity-(2-step/Warren OH)
We gave much thought to this and we decided to choose one performer to 
strictly represent the 2 step scene and this performer is no other than 
the one the only DJ Cheshire! Chris a.k.a Cheshire is a one of kind 
performer his smooth intellectual attitude gives his style a unique 
separation that blows up dance floors every time he hits the stage.  The 
love of his music is obvious with the energy that he displays every time 
he drops another funky beat. We couldn’t get enough of this incredible 
performer from last year’s last event so we had to bring the crazy cat 
back again!

Jazz be Jazz?

Jazz be born out of early American music; opera, military marching bands, 
folk music, the blues, church music, ragtime and African drumming. A 
blending of all these came to be known as Jazz. Jazz be swinging in synch, 
it be improvising the sound of light, it be an expression of freedom, 
whether it be standard, avant-garde, ballads or be-bop, Jazz Be Jazz!

What is Mini M?

MINI m’s are miniature music festivals to test the waters and answer the 
question, is Pittsburgh ready for an International Music/Performance 
Festival along the likes of SXSW, and the Philly Fringe. What makes these 
festivals miniature, is that they are only for 2 days, whereas, most 
Festivals occur over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. MINI m’s focus on 
Pittsburgh’s regional talent in a concentrated manner. Our second 
festival, Jazz Be Jazz, will feature Pittsburgh’s emerging and established 
artists, creating momentum for a new community based jazz festival in the 
city's east end.
 

The
Mini-M Jazz Be Jazz
Festival

he's as relative a newbie as i am, neither of us was there in the
beginning. 

>...and in the end, does it make a difference?

absolutely not, its dedication to music and the desire for
knowledge thats important. knowledge is the only power we can
weild, and still so many people dont do it. he did, which despite
alot of the irritation that the guy caused i still like him on
some level that i save for people who care about music above other
bullshit.

Subject: {pb-cle} ODJ / Akasha || THURSDAY || In The Mix

------------------------------------------------------------
**********|| In The Mix || *******|| Thursdays ||**********
------------------------------------------------------------
This week on In The Mix ------------>>>

ODJ - Drum & Bass 

ODJ is DirtboxRadio's resident dj and host. Discovering Jungle for the first time in the spring of '98, he fell in love with the hip-hop style beats and viscious basslines. After moving to Maryland from Texas in June of 1998, he became completely absorbed into the DC area DNB scene. In the fall of 2000, ODJ decided it was time to take his love for dnb to the next level, and start spinning it himself. He hooked up with Evil Seth shortly thereafter, who took ODJ under his wing and tought ODJ the basics of dj'ing. The two quickly formed a bond and have been feeding off each other ever since, founding the Partners in Crime crew later that winter. Around the same time, ODJ began throwing some of the most chaotic DNB house parties Maryland has ever seen - the House Party of Doom series. The parties hosted some of DC's finest jungle dj's and a lot of debauchery. If you find yourself invited to one of the future HPOD's, don't pass it up, you'll regret it. ODJ is currently doing his part to bring DC out of the shadows and into the DNB forefront, bringing sick ass talent to the 'netwaves of the world, and entertaining the junglist massive with his unique blend of hardcore amen tracks, rolling jungle, and mosh pit dnb. Keep your eyes and ears tuned for ODJ in DC and around the globe... 

Akasha - Drum & Bass 

During my years living overseas, I have constantly been exposed to many different types of world music. It was eventual that I would find myself drawn to the faster tempos and rhythms of electronic and dance music. Through my exposure of electronic culture, I find that I could readily express myself both aggressively and beautifully through the technical aspects of sample manipulation and pattern sequencing. 

When hearing drum and bass for the first time, I was flabbergasted by the sheer force of energy purveyed to me through the complexity of the beats, combined with the deep sonorous basslines characteristic to jungle specifically. I quickly adapted drum and bass as the soundtrack to my seemingly fast paced life, where every routine gesture and experience could be heightened with the accompaniment of electronic sound.

Using the moniker Signal, I hope to summon and re-emphasize the rhythmic aspects to drum & bass, without losing site of the melodic accent that has maintained its own degree of importance within the musical field. It is through the natural rhythms of our human function that we accept music as a tool to move us.

I totally agree.  Both CDs are off tha hook.  On Chris' CD, I especially like 
the last track.  I have a Jimmy Van M CD that also ends with that very same 
track.  I can't remember the name of the track off hand though.

Subject: {pb-cle} This Saturday in Columbus:  DJ DAN, D:FUSE & Ascension_AM

I am very excited to be playing at this show on Saturday, and felt the need
to do some BSP.  I hope some of you will make it out because this is going
to be a very worthwhile club event and I think there is gonna be some magic
happenin'.

Info.. story style... follows... lineup at the end.

This event is part of the RISE ( http://www.risemidwest.com ) series taking
place at The Redzone every saturday.  Headling the evening will be DJ DAN
and D:FUSE. DJ Shell will be opening the main room.

The backroom will feature Kevy Kev (many of you may remember from Mean Mr.
Mustards), Sinister, DJ Dream, Kritical 1 & Will Robinson.  Kevy Kev will be
fresh off his Electroclash night, which I hope goes well.  If you are into
underground 80's alternative stuff, then his night will be today's version
of that.  Imagine the underground artists of the 80's making music with
today's technology.

Standard Lounge ( http://www.standardlounge.com ) is where I will be
playing.   This will be a showcase room of ascension_am artists.
Ascension_am is a group of my friends who represent other local djs.  They
are super people and I am proud to represent them.  The lineup in Standard
lounge will be Mike Donovan, Doug Burkhart, Coleman Burditt, Kitsonik, and
Kid Chaos & Mark Mayhem.  Standard Lounge is the front part of The Redzone
( http://www.redzone-club.com ).

Subject: {pb-cle} Dance Culture Spirituality

Often times when I've gone to a rave or talked to people who have attended,
I've heard stories about various "spiritual" experiences, people have had at
these events.  Often these have taken place on the dance floor while dancing
on some substance.  I'm doing a project for my sociology class, and I wanted
to survey how wide spread this phenominon is, and just what impact raves are
having on our spiritual lives, if any.

Please set aside some time to take this 40 question survey.  39 questions
are multiple choice, with the final question offering space for individual
feedback.  The survey is totally anonymous, and no identifying information
from this survey will be requested or used in any way, so please be as
honest and forth right as possible.  Thank you!

The link to the Survey is here:
http://www.djmook.com/soc/

Also please pass this on to any relevant rave based lists that you can think 
of thanks!

:-)
M<><
ps- A week ago I passed out this surveyand I got a lot of great answers. I 
was about halfway through with my paper when the DB got wiped out.  I now 
have to start from scratch and only have a few days left before the paper is 
due, so I am humbly requesting everyone to please go and take the survey.

This event is part of the RISE ( http://www.risemidwest.com ) series taking
place at The Redzone every saturday. Headling the evening will be DJ DAN
and D:FUSE. DJ Shell will be opening the main room.

The backroom will feature Kevy Kev (many of you may remember from Mean Mr.
Mustards), Sinister, DJ Dream, Kritical 1 & Will Robinson. Kevy Kev will be
fresh off his Electroclash night, which I hope goes well. If you are into
underground 80's alternative stuff, then his night will be today's version
of that. Imagine the underground artists of the 80's making music with
today's technology.

Standard Lounge ( http://www.standardlounge.com ) is where I will be
playing. This will be a showcase room of ascension_am artists.
Ascension_am is a group of my friends who represent other local djs. They
are super people and I am proud to represent them. The lineup in Standard

Did he care for the music enough to NOT pollute the scene with that
bullshit?  You make no sense tom.

I think one of the biggest negative impacts on the scene was/is a whole
group of people thinking they can sell/do drugs, be involved with
underground activity and be totally absorbed with the "music".  In their
minds they have a true bond with the music.  When in all actuality all they
care about is getting by without hardwork or/and perpetuating there
lifestyle that consists of narrow, focused on self attitudes.  I challenge
any of you who sell drugs and say you love this music to stop selling drugs
and try and have a positive impact on the lives of people around you.  We
don't need more "historians of electronic music" getting busted selling meth
out of their homes.  What we need is legitimacy and respect.

first off, i have no idea if they guy has been tried and convicted
on these charges people are talking about. secondly, selling
something from your home isnt quite the same as going to raves
that you dont care about just to sell your $25 e pills to stupid
15 year olds.

i tend to agree with you on all of this. however, the actual drug
use isnt the main problem to me. going back to every one of my
great rave related experiences, many people were on drugs at each
one. this is just what any music scene is about. what happened
that fucked this one up is that it involved alot of underage kids
doing a drug no one had heard of (ecstacy) while out all night in
dodgy locations. this caused crackdowns on raves in both the UK
and the US, but it certainly hasnt stopped any of the drug use by
the artists or the fans. as much as the rampant drug use has
fucked up society's view of raving, it doesnt mean that someone
cant be into drug use or selling and not be useless. its not the
norm for sure, but entropy isnt the only example. and here's just
another reminder that almost all of my heroes in any artform were
heavy drug abusers. drugs arent necessarily the problem. society's
prosecution of them is.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fw: [jungList] One less on the list... [DJ Entropy]

first off let the record state that Tom and I have agreed on something.

Secondly, I too agree that our society as a whole needs to change their
opinion about drug use.  People should be free to make these choices.  But
all of this is a perspective of what I and many of you would envision as a
perfect world.  Bible beaters and Hitler all have had their versions as
well.  Well we don't live in a perfect world.  We all make choices in life
based on what we perceive to be right but also by what society and culture
has said is right and wrong as well.  If we continue to disregard the
majority they will continue to oppress us.  They will take every example
they can and use it against us.  They don't understand that choices should
be made by the individual.  So the real question is; based on the society we
all live in are we willing to sacrifice the music for drugs?  Do we need
drugs to enjoy the music?  Do drugs enhance our lives and give us greater
fulfillment?  I don't have the answers but I'm sure every single one of us
has a answer to these questions and they vary from person to person.

my argument is that for most people, drug use is a bad thing. they
use drugs in a non-creative manner, and thats what generates the
problem inherent in the rave scene: people who dont care about the
music unless theyre pumped full of drugs. however, it is certainly
wrong to persecute everyone equally for the fault of what in this
case is the majority. obviously something needs to be done to weed
out the morons, but even after that is said and done (if its
possible), there will still be drug users and sellers involved,
just not to the annoying to the public degree that they are now. 

and as far as letting society dictate your morals, if we allowed
that we'd all be protestants.

I don't recall seeing anyone posting info about this (if a repeat sorry)It's not BSP...I have nothing to do with it--just like the concept.  Warm Art is a global experiment focusing on a deep and organic blend of techno, house, electro, minimalism and futuristic beats. Join in the second Saturday of each month for a evening of forward--thinking electronic music at Abbasso Underground Lounge. 


This weekend, Sat. May 10th, DJ's Dan Petrov and LeeJune 14th Dan Petrov and Jason Soditch If you've heard any of these guys before you know they've got some style, and to expect some good shite...definitely not the norm.



For those of you who don't know, Warm Art is a radio show on www.protonradio.com that started with its focus on the "warm up" early evening sound. Since then, it's morphed into a blend of deep house, minimal beats, funky techno, anything a bit off of the norm.  ~Valerie

I'm up and awake early, it's fawking 9:37 AM.   Bah.

So I've done two new tracks lately, nothing you'll see on vinyl anytime =
soon or anything, but feel free to take a listen.

"MTX 2003 (Locked & Reloaded Mix)" - Hard house tip, getting ready for =
Matrix: Reloaded, I decided to drop the (hopefully) last in a =
looooooooooooong line of songs that sampled the original movie.  =
However, no "red pill/blue pill" bullshit.

"Hardcore Whores (Do It Mix)" - 120 BPM house, a bit of electro, sample =
taken from a hip-hop track I just got in on promo, "What's Up?!" by =
Inquisitive (check out the EP "Combos: Chapter One", it's good party =
shit).

Bof o' dem can be found on my soundclick page along 14 orther tracks.

I have yet to be completely confirmed, but so far, it looks like I WILL 
be going to DEMF, too. We are still undecided where to get a room 
though. So i guess I'll stop deleting messages on the subject without 
taking a look at them first. Would be kewl to meet up with anyone 
going; possible net meet?
later,
Alex

Subject: {pb-cle} (2) Black Technics 1200SLII decks 4 sale-$700 OR nice laptop trade

(2) Black Technics 1200SLII US model turntables for sale. 2 years old, 
rare factory black color (same as the European 1210s).  Never abused, no 
scratches or dents, protected on all edges against mixer scratches. used 
in home studio only-very light use (under 100 hours), the decks are in 
perfect working order. Comes with original boxes, (2) unused Technics 
headshells, (2) dust covers and (2) rubber platter pads. and each of the 
included accessories.  I had the manuals somewhere but I think in my 
recent move they are still in a box or something.  I have backup copies 
of both the user manual AND the in-demand technics 1200 service manual 
($20-$40 online) in PDF format and ill burn them on a CD for you for free.

Asking price $700 (firm) for the pair and includes in-person local 
delivery within 2 hours drive from Cincinnati assuming you are ready to 
buy upon my arrival.  Postage and mailing fees extra if required.  You 
can reach me via email @ daniel_h@fuse.net, or you can call me direct 
day or night @ 513-271-0784.

The decks were bought as a pair and I will not consider separating them. 
If you have the money and are ready to buy, I will deliver everything to 
you (in OH/IN/KY and for final dropoff/purchase only) or you can see the 
package in my home already setup for a demo.

This is the exact pair I posted about a few weeks ago.  I was a little 
wigged out about my wife being pregnant the last time and was worried 
about needing some extra cash when I put them up for sale the first 
time.  The reality is I would still rather sell them for now-and thats a 
final decision on my part.  In addition-I will consider a direct trade 
for a decent quality laptop computer.  I will consider both PC or Macs.  
Please don't offer a piece of shit laptop.  It should be at least 600mhz 
for a Pentium III/Athlon machine, 128MB, 14-15" screen and 10-20GB hard 
drive.  For a Mac, please send me the model with complete specs and ill 
let you know if the laptop is acceptable for direct trade or if extra 
cash (on either side) would make the deal work. 

Again, I'm not giving up on djing, I'm still going to make a few 
appearances this summer-this is just something I want to do for now :)

Here are recent photos of the decks

http://www.databank-m.com/1200_1.jpg

http://www.databank-m.com/1200_2.jpg

http://www.databank-m.com/1200_3.jpg

Included in the photos is a closeup of the accessories.  there are (2) 
unused Technics headshells to mount a cartridge/needle that cost $30 
each from any technics part source (I have always used Ortofons which 
are not for sale).  These are much better quality than the popular 
Stanton headshells that cost $14 each.  Also included, the large hole 45 
adapters, some kind of tonearm aligning device (never needed it-white 
plastic), the counterweights that go on the end of the tonearm for 
critical listening and calibration and the pair of free slipmats.  The 
original boxes are also included.

Every friday, at megagrooves (www.megagrooves.com) in bloomington

Scott Kellogg a.k.a Glaive put on an acid set last friday, and here's 
the mp3:

I don't sumbit this as an event as it's pretty out of the area, but if 
you'd be interested in performing, attending, or geeking out, I'd be 
more than happy to hook ya's up with the info.

Subject: {pb-cle} Update + Chart Return 5/11

Hey everyone,

Been a long time since I've sent out an update. Thanks for your patience
and interest!

At a glance - catch me this Wednesday playing house and techno (5/14)
live on DuotoneRadio (www.vinylbeats.com, click on Vinylbeats West
channel) from 9-11pm, then at The Brig playing house music with Cathy
Tamkin in Venice. This Friday (5/16) I'll be playing techno at Duotone @
The Wonderbar. And Monday (5/19) I'll be opening for Kenneth Graham,
Liza Richardson and Alland at The Derby. See below.


It's been an exciting last couple months...

After the tidal wave of coverage our techno weekly DUOTONE received
thanks to a minor publicity prank in February (the best was the killer
mention in the Village Voice, and a drop on Danny Tenaglia's web site)
Nice Fred, Erin Stephenson and I joined forces with LA's Droid Behavior
crew and moved the new and improved DUOTONE to Fridays @ Wonderbar. The
first couple nights have been a tremendous success, with a rented
gut-busting sound system, amazing DJs (Angel Alanis and DJ Hyperactive,
plus just last Friday we had Adam Jay and Praxis come down and do live
PAs), and a really, really passionate crowd (always 100+ strong). I
truly feel that we're doing a good thing by offering one of the first
bullshit-free techno weeklies Los Angeles has experienced in a long
time. Thanks to everyone who has been supportive so far.

Four of us from This is Music have also started a brand-new radio show
hosted by www.vinylbeats.com (on the Vinylbeats West channel). We
broadcast live from the store to the site, 9-11pm every Wednesday night.
Each week the show features live mixing from Nice Fred, Erin Stephenson,
Leo-9, and myself. It's been a great time so far, as we keep the store
open and the volume loud. If you're in the LA area, come by and check
out the broadcast (in our studio audience?) at 7308 1/2 Melrose Avenue
(at Poinsetta). Props to Nice Fred for killing it and setting a high
standard during our World Premiere broadcast last week. We're humbled by
everyone who tuned in! Thank you.

I've also honored to have been asked to do exclusive continuous mixes
for Music Choice Network in New York which provides multiple channels of
commercial-free music to digital cable and Direct TV subscribers in the
US (potential audience of 20-50 million). I just submitted my second mix
which has gone into rotation (average 4-5 times a week) on the DANCE
channel. 

Here's the tracklisting:

travis owens -:- darbe -:- jamie tyler

So here's the deal for sat: Darbe and I both have
birthdays the following week, as do a couple other
friends of ours, so this is an early birthday
celebration. We want to get as many heads out as we
can, play what we want to hear until we're too drunk
to work the mixer, and then hand the reins to travis
so he can throw down some thumpin' tribal/tech/who
knows what else for the rest of the evening

If this sounds like a good idea to you (or you just
need an excuse to get silly drunk) we hope to see you
out next sat.

21+ -:- free before 1am -:- no bullshxt

It's cheap to fly to The Netherlands now. It's probably more expensive 
in fact, to fly somewhere stateside than it is to fly to The 
Netherlands.

Granted, you can do all sorts of of things that would get you deported 
or worse here legally, but it's still WEIRD there.

Don't believe me? Get a passport and take a trip.

there are more extensive lineups and proper order for each show through the links... I just listed everyone for each show that I've heard of.
 
So what's up w/ a pb-cle camp @ Burning Man?

pump it up....

now thats one festival i might want to attend more than the demf
this year, but maybe not. i will hit the notting hill carnival
once in my life though, for sure. any of you who really think that
that lineup in the netherlands with nothing but bang bang cracker
techno even comes close to being able to wipe the ass of the demf
lineup must be smoking fucking crack rocks marinated in shit.
strictly aside from the fact that the originators will be in
detroit, their up and comers are fucking off the chain. if youve
never heard them (which wouldnt suprise me one bit), check: amp
fiddler, ayro, double helix, recloose (just added!), john arnold,
dwele, szymanski, aril brikha, and midwest product. no other
electronic festival that ive ever seen the lineup for can touch
JUST THOSE people. that doesnt even count slum village, kevin
saunnderson, francios k, jeff mills, carl craig + the detroit
experiment (check that LP, its the hotness), theo parrish, and
akufen. and they booked liquid liquid and esg. thats so brilliant.
honestly, theres so few holes and/or omissions in this demf
lineup, and theres no additional crapola like heather heart or
marco carola or dj krust or any other piece of shit that doesnt
belong there. this lineup is so perfect, i swear i could have
picked it myself.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} check this roster!

Something that could never be done here because of morals and values.
When I went to the University of Akron, it never ceased to amaze me how
fun allenfest and mayday were until people started chucking bottles at
bystanders. Same thing goes on at OSU now that I'm living in Columbus.
You CAN'T have a block party that doesn't get out of control, although
it would be the bee's knee's to have one right now. 

WHY do people feel the need to riot to have a good time?

Wow... I'm in a bad mood. Nicotine withdrawl. Rawr.

Have the raw rip and one I ran through soundforge to compress it a

Subject: {pb-cle} rolling stone covers anti-rave legislation





fyi

rolling stone, may 29, 2003

on page 52

(part of "the new clubland" feature, pages 51-57, including stories:

"rock is the new dance! step aside techno: bands take over the clubs" by
jon caramanica

"you can't do that here" five towns where the man is cracking down on
nightclubs, by tricia romano

"the new dj booth" inside the modern dj's control room, by d.p.

"the debauched nineties" writer frank owen describes new york when clubs
were clubs

"swing meets house music" louis jordan in da club!, by d.p.

"yoko ono, dance diva" forget paul mccartney - clubland loves yoko!, by
matt diehl

"brazil bass attack! the country of bossa nova saves jungle" by david
prince

and more)


< 'you can't do that here'
is this new york city or footloose? meet five cities that try to stop the
dancing

with the recently passed Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, federal
authorities now have another tool to shut down raves. but wait, there's
more - in the past few years, the following cities have been enforcing
their own anti-party bylaws:

1.  new york:  former mayor rudy giuliani dusted off the prohibition-era
cabaret law in the mid-nineties to clamp down on clubs - it says that a
venue must have a license if more than three people are "moving
rhythmically" to music.

2.  charlotte, north carolina:  promoters are required to apply for a
permit to stay open after 2:30 a.m.  all dance events with teens in
attendance have to close by 11 p.m. on weekdays and midnight on weekends.

3.  chicago:  promoters, property owners and even djs can be fined up to
$10,000 for hosting or performing at an unlicensed, for-profit dance event.

4.  orlando, florida:  all clubs serving booze must close by 3 a.m. and are
not allowed to reopen to host raves.

5.  milwaukee:  a town infamous for fining partygoers for once "aiding and
abetting" unlicensed promoters (charges were later dropped) imposes an 11
p.m. curfew for minors on weekends.

tricia romano >


the title and subtitle of the first story upset me greatly because they
sound so dismissive of something we love and care about, but i am glad that
they are continuing to cover the anti-rave legislation.

ALSO,
in the 5/15/03 issue of rolling stone:

on page 30,

<  "Trouble in Clubland: Congress passes controversial anti-rave bill"

By Jenny Eliscu

Dance clubs, concert halls and even outdoor festivals are in danger of
being put out of business thanks to a new piece of legislation that passed
in
Congress on April 10th. According to the bill, any individual who owns or
operates a venue where audience members are using drugs could be sent to
jail
or subjected to steep fines. Sponsored by senators Joseph Biden (D-Del.),
Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), the bill was tacked
onto
the Amber Alert Act, concerning child abductions - a move opponents say was

intended to avoid close scrutiny. (The new law is a revision of an earlier
proposal known as the RAVE Act, an acronym for Reducing Americans'
Vulnerability to Ecstasy.)

"It isn't just a threat to the rave community," say William McColl,
director
of National Affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, "but to any community
that
isn't liked by the majority - hip-hop events, gay and lesbian circuit
parties, even rock & roll shows like the Grateful Dead or Phish." McColl
acknowledges it could be years before anyone is prosecuted but says the law

may scare off promoters and keep them from holding raves.

Biden was unavailable for comment, but his office directed Rolling Stone to

speak with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.  "We're not anti-rave,"

says that group's spokesman, Howard Simon. "This isn't like John Lithgow in

Footloose telling people, 'Good God, don't dance.' This could help
authorities to go after the few bad apples turning a winking blind eye to
drug use."

Donnie Estopinal, the New Orleans promoter who was unsuccessfully
prosecuted
in 2000 under the federal "crackhouse statute," doesn't see it that way.
"This law will definitely have an effect on whether promoters can get
access
to venues," he says. "Just the threat of being prosecuted is enough to
scare
people away.

"We already search the hell out of everybody," he continues. "It's harder
to
get into a rave than it is to get on an airplane. We're forced to treat our

customers like criminals before they even get in the door." >


if you'd like to write to rolling stone to thank them for bringing the
anti-rave legislation to the attention of its readers, please write to them
at:  letters@rollingstone.com.  fax 212-484-3434

thanks.

respect,
mary :)

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

headrushmusic presents
 
saturday, may 31
JOHN HOWARD (om records, san francisco)

Part Two of the Summer Series 2003
 
Join us for John's four-hour set.
 
John Howard is a legend in house music. He started DJing in 1993, during 
San Francisco’s infamous Summer of Love. John’s first regular appearances 
were at Groove Kitchen and the Boogie Buffet with Mark Farina. Then on to 
Stompy Stomp, Together with Dubtribe, Spundae, and Wicked.

John’s sound is smooth San Fran funk fused with a large dose of Chicago 
style, combined with his own brand of eclectic jazz and Bay Area 
influences. It’s always funky and it’s always different.

You've heard John rock it on the critically acclaimed SF Sessions Series 
from OM Records. And now he’s rising as a producer, with his track “Buddha 
Cowboy” appearing on OM’s 100th Release double CD.  Visit 
http://www.headrushmusic.com to listen to a mix set by John Howard and to 
read interviews with him.

Sat Jun 14                          SE7EN                           NE Ohio

On Saturday, June 14th, 2003 Unified Entertainment, Wishing Well, and 
Phareal Productions bring you up to Northeast Ohio again for.........

"SE7EN"

Pride, Anger, Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, and Lust.

These are the things that come between people in general, promoters, 
cities, and different scenes that end up destroying it if it isn't fixed. 
This event will feature djs from all over and the main theme is for us to 
look at what we do every day that might hurt our scene and work on 
changing it. We think that if we can all throw away the bickering and the 
arguing this area of Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Dayton, 
Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Indianapolis, Nashville, and any other 
cities that are involved in our scene every week will be the talk 
everywhere as the places to be or just the Midwest in general.

anything else you might throw on the ground.This is a beautiful venue 
surrounded by a state park,so try to keep everything nice looking. This 
venue is in the middle of no where and all permits have or will be taken

Sat Jun 28                 ABASSO SUMMER SERIES 3                 Cleveland

headrushmusic presents

:: saturday, june 28 ::
:: part three of the summer series 2003 ::

JERRY BONHAM  (bedrock, renaissance, saw, spundae, san francisco)

Jerry Bonham, a pioneer in progressive, has been doing what he does best
for almost three decades. Jerry is a living legend - one of the true
beacons of electronic dance music.

Born in North Dakota, Jerry Bonham grew up listening to pop music from the
'70's, everything ranging from Barry White, and Sly to the Family Stone.  
In 1976 at the height of the Disco Era, Jerry ventured into Minneapolis,
where he began his DJing career. Later, Michael Graber, a Chicago DJ,
introduced Jerry to the infinite possibilities of mixing and live
composition, guided him away from simply being a mobile DJ. Instead of
playing only the hits like many fellow jockeys of that time, Jerry favored
the less-obvious works.

In 1988, he relocated from Minneapolis to San Francisco, where he became
engrossed in its local scene and fell in love with the people, the music
and the city. In early 1996, Jerry started his residency at San Fran's
super club Spundae/Nikita at 1015 Folsom. As the partnership grew, he
became co-owner of the Spundae Reckords Store located on Haight Street.

Jerry Bonham's DJing career on the dance floor skyrocketed during the late
'90's, his production standards paralleled the rise, hit after hit. In
1998, Jerry's first mix CD, "Interpretations," was released on Spundae
Recordings, followed by his celebrated 1999 release "Tranceglobalnation 3"
on Arcade America, one of Europe's most respected and influential
electronic dance music labels. "Interpretations II" is Jerry's latest mix
compilation released on Mute and Spundae Recordings. The CD was an instant
hit with 20,000 pre-sold copies.

In the recording studio, Jerry forged on to refine his progressive sound,
recording a remix of Expansion's "Listen" for the Texas based Funked-Up
Label. He is also part of the JSJ collective, also known as Jondi, Spesh,
and Jerry Bonham. Together, they recorded "Deep Love 9" and "Ghost of You"
on Renaissance; both tracks became the must-haves in a DJ's crate - two
absolute floor-fillers. In early 2001 Jerry recorded the single "Erendira"
(Spanish for "joy") with Planetary Consciousness on Bedrock. His recent
studio work is the solo track called "Seventh Seal", a 12-minute long
journey that opens with beautiful tunes and stripped drums, eventually
evolving into a complex web of progressive sounds and melodies.

John Digweed noted Jerry as a "world-class DJ", who "has been one of the
main pioneers of the progressive sound on the West Coast since the very
start, forever championing the latest sounds and pushing the music
forward." Dave Ralph added that Jerry is "the most underrated DJ in
America, who has real talent and depth."

Jerry Bonham has helped to define America's electronic dance music
movement with his flawless performances, and extraordinary production
skills.  Forever influencing the music, Jerry Bonham continues to love the
music as passionately as he lives and creates it.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)

The time is 1200 hours the date is 10/18/03 and the location is Pittsburgh 
PA.  The company that brought you a revolutionary event is now back to 
bring you the much-anticipated sequel to a phenomenon that began 1 year 
ago.  We gave much thought about how we could improve our event from last 
year and we decided to eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes 
brutal outdoors so we moved the legacy that started it all indoors into a 
beautiful large facility located in the heart of the steel city. We wanted 
to assure everyone’s safety this year and keep our show as a one of kind 
superstar import car event.  Even though we wont be racing vehicles this 
year there will be tons of fun, and many different creative things going 
on.  I will have to keep you in suspense about most of the activities that 
we have planned until the time is right but I will give you brief taste of 
what is in store for SO2.  Picture an event like you have never witnessed 
before lights, visuals, sound, lasers, dancers, djs, mc’s, models, free 
stuff, contests, entertainers, many different automobile divisions, tons 
of cash prizes, a outdoor portion and indoor portion, and much more TBA!  
If you thought that Street Outlawz was as good as gets you won’t believe 
your eyes when SO2 hits the city. So prepare yourself for an event that 
will once again go down into the history of the Steel City!


ELECTRONIC MUSIC:
	(These are only a few of the major headliners that will be 
featured at the event please stay posted to our website 
www.steelcityracing.com for more detailed information)

DRUM N BASS:

FREAKY FLOW w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone can’t get enough of 
his outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If it’s not 
magazines then it’s live TV the Freaky Flow combination has truly been 
just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didn’t have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!




UFO! (Drum N Bass)
(Phracktel/ Phunckateck/ Phylum Recordings-SF)

The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!  Please don’t be alarmed by 
the name the aliens are not really coming.  However this is just one more 
incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he his mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that 
whenever he drops his dubs the dance floor will be screaming for more.  If 
you hadn’t had the chance to see this west coast legend then allow 
yourself the time to hit the dance floor at SO2 for an unforgettable 
musical experience!

AND MORE TBA!

HAPPY HARDCORE!

*Unfortunately we cannot disclose this highly confidential information at 
this time.  However we can say this what is coming is so big that all you 
happy hardcore kids better get your whistles ready and start shining them 
early because this headliner is a major ordeal and we promise it to be a 
once in the lifetime opportunity!


TRANCE

*Once again for security reasons we cannot release any information 
concerning this major headliner however we promise that you won’t be 
disappointed!  Keep in touch with our website to find out further updates

Jazz be Jazz?

Jazz be born out of early American music; opera, military marching bands, 
folk music, the blues, church music, ragtime and African drumming. A 
blending of all these came to be known as Jazz. Jazz be swinging in synch, 
it be improvising the sound of light, it be an expression of freedom, 
whether it be standard, avant-garde, ballads or be-bop, Jazz Be Jazz!

What is Mini M?

MINI m’s are miniature music festivals to test the waters and answer the 
question, is Pittsburgh ready for an International Music/Performance 
Festival along the likes of SXSW, and the Philly Fringe. What makes these 
festivals miniature, is that they are only for 2 days, whereas, most 
Festivals occur over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. MINI m’s focus on 
Pittsburgh’s regional talent in a concentrated manner. Our second 
festival, Jazz Be Jazz, will feature Pittsburgh’s emerging and established 
artists, creating momentum for a new community based jazz festival in the 
city's east end.
 

The
Mini-M Jazz Be Jazz
Festival

Fri May 2nd - Sat May 3rd @ The Quiet Storm

 

keep your good vibes strong!

Jason,

I'm sure you are aware but Shawn will not be there tonight.  I just
thought I would send a quick note in response, I am not sure if you would
want that in your promo or not.  Take care, maybe see you tonight.

Subject: {pb-cle} paging TECHNOIR AUDIO 

Dear TECHNOIR AUDIO guys,

I've just been informed that Shawn WILL NOT be performing tonight at HAVANA 
... ????

Last I spoke wth him, he was all geared up for this record release tonight.

Can someone confirm with me so I'm not spouting off bad information.  I just 
spoke with Curt last evening about sound checks and set up times but nothing 
was said to me that Shawn would not be there.

Thanks,

Jason C.

Did anyone go see this last night?  If you did what did you think?  I liked 
it.  I thought it was good.  Maybe not as impressive or "make the hair on 
the back of you neck stand up exciting" as the last one but still good.

If any of you have still not yet checked out Abbasso, I recommend this Sat. a great night to do so.  If you even have had the slightest inkling of wondering what the place is all about.....
 
This should be a great night to meet a lot of the regulars, and from what I've heard a lot of heads should be out for the night.  
 
I neither work for nor am a promoter for Abbasso, but really want to give them credit for their efforts to create a positive vibe...there's much more of a sense of community and respect for both people and the music then I've seen in many other clubs---they're doing a lot to bring great music into Cleveland, as well as provide a chill atmosphere for people to hang out in, and it's been cool to see constant imrovement in the quality of both music and crowd there. 
 
blah..blah...I'll quit babbling now, I'm sure there are people on this list who could figure out the point I'm trying to make, and say it better.
 
Just trying to pat some of the people responsible for making my weekends pretty darn enjoyable on the back I guess. 
 
P.s.  Have any of you looked at the summer series lineups---damn!  nice......

So here's the deal for sat: Darbe and I both have
birthdays the following week, as do a couple other
friends of ours, so this is an early birthday
celebration. We want to get as many heads out as we
can, play what we want to hear until we're too drunk
to work the mixer, and then hand the reins to travis
so he can throw down some thumpin' tribal/tech/who
knows what else for the rest of the evening

If this sounds like a good idea to you (or you just
need an excuse to get silly drunk) we hope to see you
out next sat.

  I saw it last night and thought it was good.  The fight scenes and special 
effects are excellent.  But I'm still debating on whether I liked this one or 
the first one better, probably the first one.

I really liked it.  I'm a visual person so all the special effect 
kicked butt.  Still amazed that the "burly brawl" with all the agents 
was completely CG.  They scanned the actors and scene and stuff, and 
they used a whole bunch of martial arts people with motion capture

saw a cg effect that I could definitely not tell that it was CG.  As

If you really want to see something WEIRD and japanese, try 
http://www.malevole.com/mv/misc/tribute/ sometime. It's not up now, but 
it'll probably be back up sometime later.

Imagine if you will, Jason and the Argonauts type skeletons popping out 
of the ground and clips of Skeletor from the Masters of the Universe 
Cartoons lip synching with a Japanese version of YMCA.

I really hope that comes back up later.

AHH! I found a mirror!

http://www.mattround.freeserve.co.uk/files/tribute.swf

It is totally worth the long wait to load. I used to run a skeletor 
friday feature on my website where I'd feature a different link about 
something skeletor related, and this one took the cake.

I didn't go last year, but Rayge and I are going
this year. I am really looking forward to Hux flux
and Oliver from Iboga records. I spin alot of Iboga
and it will be cool to finally meet someone from 
that label. Kri is another one I have been waiting 
to see. This is really going to be a great event!


Peace,

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} last night @ havana

Thanks to the Technoir Audio crew for rocking the house last night.  You 
guys did a great job and we had a perfect evening.  You guys had old and 
young shaking their asses.  I even saw Tom Cox dancing for a bit.  Nice vibe 
all night long.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} semiOT: good jazz related article

Great article...

And a fascinating implication of the question: "Are we really closer to racial equality, or has the
racism become more subliminal and/or subconscious?"

No, there aren't secret meetings of the White Pentavaret planning the media strategy to exclude
certain races or even sections of races from success in society, but one must raise the question:

Why is Diana Krall selling more records in five years than Billie Holliday during the entire span of
her career?

Subject: {pb-cle} Havana last night - TNA002 release party


I want to say thanks to Jason from Havana on behalf of Technoir Audio for
the honor of having us play at, in my opinion, the best night going on in
Pittsburgh.  Havana was an incredible blast!! It was ridiculous - and a
diverse array of great musics techno and otherwise was dropped to a quite
packed and responsive crowd.

Since it was a release party, the record of course was played, but if you
didn't hear it (or see Curt holding it up), you can check it out on
wwww.technoiraudio.com or in your record store.

I have some pictures I took, but it might be a bit before I get a chance
to size them down, but when I do I will give them to Jason to post or I
will post them.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} anybody goto GAIAN last year?

Sounds like this will be an incredible event and venue,  
see you there.

Ok so I'm being the dick sorry. I rarely post on this list and to have someone question a question about an event just seemed odd so I'm not jumping handles this is me sweet and fresh n the morning didn't mean any offense.  and with the spam reference kind of had me quessing... 
the REASON for questioning the leagality... like i thought you would know.  I personally have been to a number of events that
have been sketchy to say the least that have taken much of my time to end up being nothing more than nice long road trips.
for instance...  was at a warehouse party 2 months ago...
having a great time 2 am next thing you know,  a guys at the gates blocking the entrance so no one could leave.  Someone
drove a truck through a fence and a few cars got out.  As we were entering the main highway here comes no joke ten cruisers and a wagon.  Thats the deal just lookin for a good time no hassles.  PLUR

If you like drum & bass I recommend the Seminar (www.bassbythepound.com)
on Weds. nights.  Some of my peeps run the sister radio program on WNUR
(www.wnur.org), also on Weds. nights.

Smartbar definately, and Transit...those are the ones
my friends in that area are all about.  RedNoFive used
to be really fun as well, but (again according to my
friends) they've fallen off somewhat of late.  

If you want huge and rediculously loud there's always
Crobar as well, but i've never really had a good time
there personally.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} matrix reloaded

I thought there was too much action and not enough story elements.  The 
action sequences were fucking fantastic just too numerous and too long.  
Also the whole "Zion Rave" sequence was annoying, and listening to Morpheus 
give an inspiring speech was a yawn.

Not nearly as impressive as the first one.

I guess that is the effect of not having to work as hard since the demand 
was so high.

Wow: I figured if anyone would undertstand the importance and
reighteousness of that scene it would be this board. Me and my wife were
completely entranced by it. If real-world raves had 1/10 of the meaning that
one did you wouldn't be able to drag me away from them.

the last thing i want when i go out is professionalism.  i'm talking about
the promoter toting shot glasses in his pants.  not too often can you find a
place that encourages semi-raucous behavior, has toilet paper in the
bathrooms at 1:55am, and supports the erland oye and amp fiddler.

i had fun too.

I was dicking around with Acid & Soundforge, decided to attempt to =
program a full mix CD.  Came out ok.  Could be much worse.  Much =
different than what I would normally spin in a set (some of it was mp3's =
I just really liked), some speed garage, house, breaks.  So if you want =

give away free drugs, im sure people will show up. other than
that, good luck. i dont think ive ever seen anything more activist
done by a group of specifically ravers than bringing cans of food
to a rave to get a couple $$$ off the price of admission.

who really needs a reason to be active?  i mean, that's half the point ..
you should just -be- active.  i think that myself, and those involved with
the earthday events, would disagree with your statement about our asses.

thats my point. you guys did something, but you were a small group 
of people who were doing an event. take the music and art out of 
it, and see how many people would show up.

i wasnt talking about you guys, i was talking about the people who 
showed up

fuck I would go to demf just to go to that one afterparty.  Thats a sick
lineup.

Ohh and ultra top-secret afterparties are boring because everybody there
thinks they are so cool cuz they are there and it kills anything.  Then u
end up with some kid trying to get exposure or/and everybody looking at
everybody wondering if they are important enough to talk to.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} demf after parties?

for real.  i went to the seventh city afterhours a few years back and it was
BORING.  music was off the hizzy (metro area live!!!) but not many people
and too much attitude.  most people stood around talking about how
everything (and i mean everything) would be better if this/that/the other
instead of getting down to some tunes.

there was no such problem at the tronic treatment party the next night.  not
pure detroit techno, but it was FUN.

regardless, i wish i could go this year.  a promotion at work is keeping me
busy next weekend.

Donating can goods to get less off admission price was just to support the
promoter, not the homeless! =P

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} community service

I'm a little late responding to this post, but thought you all might find it
interesting that out here in Kansas City a couple years ago there was  a
group of community-service-minded ravers that was active. They called
themselves Ravers Care. They adopted a stretch along a local highway for
cleanup, volunteered at a homeless shelter, published a regular newsletter
and tried to raise money for good causes through car washes, etc. They
probably lasted about a year. I was really excited by what they were doing.
It did have the potential to change some perceptions mainstream people have
about raves and ravers.

Unfortunately, the group didn't last. I think part of it had to do with the
fact that by the time they started their group our whole rave scene had
collapsed and everything was heading into the clubs. Not as many people
these days identify themselves as ravers. I don't know how it is there in
PB-CLE, but here, unless you were in to the scene before, say, two years ago
when there were still events you might call a "rave," you aren't likely to
think of yourself as a "raver" or identify that strongly with the cultural
part of the scene.

Even today, there are still plenty of people here that are into the music,
but very few who think of the music as a "scene" or a culture that they are
part of. Kinda sad when you think about it! Maybe this is responsible for
people's lackadaisical reaction to the anti-rave legislation??

Another unfortunate reason why the Ravers Care group went under is that one
or two of the main organizers got busted for drugs. Nice! What were they
thinking???? If you're going to hold yourself up to society to try to make a
good impression for the scene, then please, for God's sake, make sure your
actions and activities will stand up to society's scrutiny.

Well, the idea was good, but wrong time and lacked leadership.

In the meantime, there are several ravers, or pro-dance-music people, here
who attend meetings of other civic-minded groups such as the Downtown
Redevelopment Council, city Council meetings, etc.

In fact, once when a group of us found out the DEA was hosting a Rave Town
Hall here, we organized a group of about 100 ravers to attend the meeting.
Boy, were there some surprised faces among the DEA and city council members
sponsoring it! We showed up with Rave Fact Sheets which we handed to all the
members of the media that were present and several of us stayed after the
meeting to introduce ourselves to the speakers, thank them for putting on
the program and get in a few plugs for the rave scene.

Every city has groups like this that individuals can and should get involved
in. Even if you only go occasionally, it's better than nothing. Believe me,
those council people will remember when young people come out to their
meetings! And, if you introduce yourself and say, I'm here because I have an
interest in making sure there are enough outlets in this city for people to
dance and hear the latest dance music (or however you want to say it), they
WILL remember that. It gives the rave scene a "face" and make it harder for
elected representatives to ignore our needs and interests.

 . . . a good thread!

Look for my brother Todd and I at DEMF!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Abbasso on Sat?

 Not a bad evening, all things considered.  Darren
 and
 I acheived our goal of drunken silliness (although
 fortunately we gave up the decks to Travis before we
 could really embarrass ourselves), and it was nice
 to
 see a lot of our friends out.  The late-night crowd
 was a bit on the light side, but I was having too
 much
 fun chillin' with friends to be too concerned. 
 Travis, of course, was solid as always.
 
 Thanks to any who did make it out, and thanks to
 Napoleon for lettin' us do it...t'was a fun night.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} anybody goto GAIAN last year?

i went last year, and will be there again this year.  just a word of warning, 
this event is NOT A RAVE, and as such there are no lasers, no technobeams, 
etc.  there will be fluoro psychedelic decorations and artwork incorporated 
into the natural surroundings and highlighted by blacklights.  but the 
natural beauty of the place is really all the enhancemenmt you will need.  
the dance space is called the standing stone circle, and resembles 
stonehenge.  the chillout area is next to a stream and lots of woods and last 
year there were large hammocks in the trees.  

the location is a large outdoor non-denominational earth religion sanctuary, 
and because it is religiously affiliated it has special legal protection and 
so there was absolutely no problem with police.  it is also due to the fact 
that there really was no need, as it was a very mature, mostly older, 
respectful crowd.  it was a mixture of many types of people: psytrancers, 
hippies, pagans, philosphers, travellers, freaks, older people, younger 
people, a lot of families with children, etc.

for more iformation on the space: www.4qf.org 

the location is host to many diverse activities.  the week before last year's 
festival there was a santeria festival complete with goat sacrificing, etc. 
and many of the participants go to many of the events there just to check 
them out, so expect a diverse crowd! 

i would say there were about 300 attendees last year, and i'm sure there will 
be more this year.  but the high price tag (tickets are currently $100 and 
they are $125 at the door) serves as "quality control" of sorts.  it's a 
little pricey, especially considering there are only three big headliners, 
but the local talent is top-notch and every detail is taken care of: free 
water available all over the location, lots of space for camping, free 
showers, optional meal plan, free coffee/tea, yoga sessions, riverside 
swimming, free parking, crystal-clear sound, and incredible music.  it is 
done very professionally and things went very smoothly.

while it is expensive, i feel like i got my money's worth last year and i 
already have my ticket for this year.  but don't expect a rave, and please 
don't treat it as one...

more info is at www.gaian-mind.com

and since we are on the subject of festivals, there is a big psytrance 
festival in upstate new york that is a little bit cheaper (tickets are 
currently $45 but will progresively go up and will be $125 at the door) but 
the lineup is a lot bigger.  of course it's farther away (probably 8 hours 
from pittsburgh vs. a little over 2 for the gaian mind festival).  but it 
will definitely be worth the trip.  the website is 
www.onmidancefestival.info.  i will be playing there, so definitely look me 
up if you are planning to attend.

also, a little bit of bsp: samadhi takes place sat. may 31 in pittsburgh.  
kri and blue spectral monkey are two of the country's most talented psytrance 
dj's and will blow your mind unlike any other.  also, kri is unveiling his 
live act for the first time in pennsylvania.  plus psyphon will be playing, 
and although he is a local, he is probably the best psytrance dj i have ever 
seen, and i have seen many in my day.  i cannot speak highly enough of him 
and am truly honored to have him on my roster.  more info is at 
www.sidetrakkt.com.

if anyone is heading to any of the above events and is interested in 
carpooling, let me know and we can try to work arrangements out.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} anybody goto GAIAN last year?

My husband to be in less than 4 weeks, Luke and myself will be attending the 
festival this year.  I just ordered my tickets today and was able to get the 
early bird special which was for $75 a person.  Today is the last day for that 
price though.  We will also be in attendence at Samadhi.  I am definitely 
looking forward to both events.

Quoting Dansidetrakkt@cs.com:

Whats up Chris?  Long time.  So how long have you been spinning?

My notes on this:  CD's in some aspects are HARDER to work with than vinyl
(unless of course you have one of those fancy beat match for you CD decks,
but most people I know DONT.)...  Unless you are working with a really
powerful system that you can really discern the difference in sound, there
really isnt a difference between CD's and Vinyl.  Sure, I prefer the sound
of vinyl, it makes me happy, but CD's are much more portable.  Ask anyone
what the difference is between mixing vinyl and CD, and the reason vinyl is
easier is because you can actually touch the record.  You just cant recreate
that no matter how phat your CD turntable is, even the touch sensitivity on
the CDJ-1000 doesnt compare.  On the other hand, it's much quicker to cue up
a cd than to find a cue point on a record, so that's the balancing factor
for this brief retort.

Danielle:  I hope you find whatever it is you were looking for with one of
those gents, and don't forget to bring a towel.

That reminds me...

LISA SHAW will be @ Eve Lounge with Swingsett this Saturday night - May
24th.  Live vocalist ala Naked Music singing over top some house music!


Oh, most of the Naked Stuff is all available digitally -- on a real CD where
the artists get money... and can continue to make more of that lovely
beautful music.  Even though it is going to go in one ear and out the
other -  please don't use this wonderful brilliant music to seek your status
in the filesharing community.  I'd like to hear more of it and see what
level they head to next.

I tend to agree with Goose on this topic.

And for the record (and a little BSP), at CDG Tres, I'll be DJ'ing with my computer w/ many many
many custom edits of tracks and self-produced stuff. Try THAT with vinyl.

(And for the record, I know....I just can't afford Final Scratch at the moment)

Anyone have a Kaos pad they're looking to sell??

a cd than to find a cue point on a record, so that's the balancing factor
for this brief retort.

Danielle:  I hope you find whatever it is you were looking for with one of
those gents, and don't forget to bring a towel.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Naked Music Label

yeah, well, listening to something usually precedes buying it.  And as you
know this genre of music usually is more set up to being purchased on 12"...
plus i'm sure the cd compilations dont have the b side mixes you find on the
12"'s (which i still believe to be the better mixes on alot of these)  And
we've been down this road before Doug... artist profit vs label profit vs
filesharing pros and cons... at 10-12 bucks for a 12" single, seems to me
the profit levels wouldnt be too shabby if the artist made tracks that
everyone completely loved and DJ's wanted to buy.  It's not a status thing
at all, more than I had something I knew people would appreciate and i was
sharing it.  Kinda like when people BSP their mixes, it's not for status,
it's to share something that they hope people appreciate.  then we also get
into the what's the difference if i share a mix with all the tracks on it vs
sharing the individual tracks when it's not for profit?

Subject: {pb-cle} file sharing/buying conversation...breaks djs look here

ive been in the middle of converting my vinyl to mp3 (laborious as it 
is) and i think labels need to open their eyes towards selling mp3s.  i 
know there has been a bunch of times since ive started this process that 
ive used mp3s from soulseek of vinyl i already own instead of burning it 
myself.  there have also been a bunch of times where ive downloaded 
tracks, particularly bootlegs and mashups you wont normally find in a 
record store either.  a source like soulseek is the most equal 
distributor there is-no watts, nemesis, dbi etc. bullshit and you have a 
virtually instant delivery time.  in addition you dont have to rely on 
the sometimes subpar buyers @ your local facility.

there is always a place for the traditional stores, but i see a future 
for the digital realm also.  i know that i personally would spend $30-50 
per month for a soulseek-type service if i could download whatever i 
wanted and it was populated by current tracks in a similar manner to 
what record stores offer. im betting a shitload of other djs would too.

on that same tangent, there is a label i know and will recommend-Skydive 
UK who sells their tracks in mp3 format along side their vinyl releases. 
 tracks are 1 pound per track and 1.99 pounds per complete release.  i 
bought the 3 eps that are available and it came out to about $9.75 USD. 
 i think that is a more than fair price for 3 tracks that i dont have to 
buy and burn from the store.  this is from the perspective of someone 
moving to a traktor/final scratch setup but i can only imagine there are 
a lot of others who would find this equally interesting.  if you are 
into breaks/nu school breaks check out the site below and follow the 
links to the mp3 store.  Skydive is a quality label who work with 
Kraymon, Johan (Sound of Habib) and Future Funk Squad in addition to 
their artists.

shut the fuck up you retard. most of the shit is recorded 
digitally or at least uses digital samplers or virtual analogue 
technology. if its not, there arent many if any places that master 
and press vinyl entirely in analogue. so as soon as you use even a 
24 bit digital, your final analogue pressing still wont have a 
higher resolution than that.

The whole dance industry is rather convoluted. You CAN get whatever you
want on CD or MP3 if you're connected enough. 

I'd pay a whole lot more than $30-$50 a month for a service like
emusic.com, PCDJ just started a service called the record pool that
works like that, but you have to use their software, which IMHO blows.

Maybe I'll just take that money and make you rip my wax instead. :)

Subject: {pb-cle} file sharing/buying conversation...breaks djs look
here


ive been in the middle of converting my vinyl to mp3 (laborious as it 
is) and i think labels need to open their eyes towards selling mp3s.  i 
know there has been a bunch of times since ive started this process that

ive used mp3s from soulseek of vinyl i already own instead of burning it

myself.  there have also been a bunch of times where ive downloaded 
tracks, particularly bootlegs and mashups you wont normally find in a 
record store either.  a source like soulseek is the most equal 
distributor there is-no watts, nemesis, dbi etc. bullshit and you have a

virtually instant delivery time.  in addition you dont have to rely on 
the sometimes subpar buyers @ your local facility.

there is always a place for the traditional stores, but i see a future 
for the digital realm also.  i know that i personally would spend $30-50

per month for a soulseek-type service if i could download whatever i 
wanted and it was populated by current tracks in a similar manner to 
what record stores offer. im betting a shitload of other djs would too.

on that same tangent, there is a label i know and will recommend-Skydive

UK who sells their tracks in mp3 format along side their vinyl releases.

 tracks are 1 pound per track and 1.99 pounds per complete release.  i 
bought the 3 eps that are available and it came out to about $9.75 USD. 
 i think that is a more than fair price for 3 tracks that i dont have to

buy and burn from the store.  this is from the perspective of someone 
moving to a traktor/final scratch setup but i can only imagine there are

a lot of others who would find this equally interesting.  if you are 
into breaks/nu school breaks check out the site below and follow the 
links to the mp3 store.  Skydive is a quality label who work with 
Kraymon, Johan (Sound of Habib) and Future Funk Squad in addition to 
their artists.

I'd even go as far to say that DJ's will be replaced by Ableton Live
users. Once Traktor has midi support, a MP3/DJ laptop going head to head
with a midi synced Ableton Live laptop will obsolete the DJ. Throw in
Reason via Rewire on the Live side, and you've the the ultimate triple
threat that wax cannot top in a live music setting.

I doubt it sincerely.

You still need GOOD music. The one good thing about the archaic system of music distrobution that
still exists is that it helps to filter out *SOME* of the crap that shouldn't see the light of
day....

so you are going to lug around your laptop, and spend countless 
hours downloading all the hot records you copied( not you mark 
just making a point;) from (insert big name dj's top ten list), 
just to play for $50 to $100 paying gig at any club, in anytown 
usa? yeah that's smart!

MP3, abelton, whatever you feel like you using, I still crush 
anyone using my good old fashion vinyl. How can that be you ask? 
Becuase the music i play is the shit. and my records never crashed 
on me, as I've seen final scratch due a couple of times (eg. 
magda's performance at shift last year).  and don't worry i won't 
be burning any of my records to mp3 becuase i don't like to share!

just play good music, quit worrying about the bells and whistles, 
becuase you still have to have talent to make it work.

the hours less working to pay for all the large records will give
you plenty of extra time to spend hunting mp3s. might i point out
that it doesnt take long. 

and as far as the pay, the intial $1000 for a laptop to use final
scratch or traktor with is the quivalent of only 100 import
records. thats not many for a deejay to have.

>be burning any of my records to mp3 becuase i don't like to share!

but of course other people are nice, so it all gets out. you know
i have a very large portion of the stuff you have on vinyl on mp3. 

and again, you did get your records stolen, irreplacably in some
cases. i could back up my entire mp3 collection for $100 on a
backup IDE drive. so you could steal my laptop all you want, i
could still have the same tunes the next day. and the beauty of
this setup of course is that if/when it becomes standard, the
laptop will be provided ala the way technics are now. that means
you can just "lug" around a small satchel with your headphones and
a firewire/usb/tomorrow's plugable drive with unlimited songs on it. 

>just play good music, quit worrying about the bells and whistles, 
>becuase you still have to have talent to make it work.

this is true, and its why i think that if anything the final
scratch will help people who play good music because suddenly they
can select anything they want instead of being limited to what
they have on vinyl. ive got a pretty good vinyl selection, but my
mp3 selection is even crazier. dont get me wrong, i love my vinyl,
as long as they keep making it ill be buying it. but there are
certainly some other methods that can be used that are cheaper,
less bulky, more easily backed up, and more populist that vinyl is.

one other point...good music can come on cd too...some good music only comes 
on cd...i think everyone is hype over vinyl cuz of its mystique...remember 
the first time you watched a mix dj...remember how you thought to yourself, 
gee i wonder what is going on...then once you realise what the dj is 
doing...its not such a big deal and you realise it can be done with any 
other medium.


mark...pitch control is the right way...you do things the left way...bastard

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} help!!!

I had fun a Josh Wink this last Friday and from what I was told he had only 
20 records with him ... the rest was final scratch and a CDJ-1000.

but that's just it - I had fun - didn't even look to what he was using - 
didn't care -
it all sounded good to me.

thats what im saying. having every track created available to you
means that it stresses how your set flows and your knowledge of a
huge amount of music when selecting which tunes youre going to
pick. that said, ive not been sold on final scratch or traktor
yet. if final scratch became industry standard and i could just
bring a portable firewire drive everywhere with me to deejay, id
switch to that for sure and encode any new records id buy. until
then, im not satisfied with the level of control on the CDJ-1000
for the price they are. if they were $500 for a pair, id have to
think long and hard about using that. right now theyre around
$2000 a pair. in time im sure one of these will become the new
standard and lots of deejays backs will be thanking god.

so you are going to lug around your laptop, and spend countless
hours downloading all the hot records you copied( not you mark
just making a point;) from (insert big name dj's top ten list),
just to play for $50 to $100 paying gig at any club, in anytown
usa? yeah that's smart!

MP3, abelton, whatever you feel like you using, I still crush
anyone using my good old fashion vinyl. How can that be you ask?
Becuase the music i play is the shit. and my records never crashed
on me, as I've seen final scratch due a couple of times (eg.
magda's performance at shift last year).  and don't worry i won't
be burning any of my records to mp3 becuase i don't like to share!

just play good music, quit worrying about the bells and whistles,
becuase you still have to have talent to make it work.

no, barry had one. it supposedly messed up his speech and his

Not a good day for 70's r&b.

Saw Matrix over the weekend.   Thought Jada Pinkett did a pretty good =
job in Aaliyah's role.  As far as disappointing:  not really.  I didn't =
expect this to be a movie that stood on it's own.  The Wachowski =
brothers weren't sure they were going to get a trilogy out of it, so the =
first movie was designed to be able to stand on it's own if it wasn't =
popular.  "..Reloaded" was just a bridge between the original and =
"..Revolutions".

Well, they both had strokes.  From what I can gather, Barry's was less
severe.  It doesn't sound like Luther is going to be coming out of his coma,
and if he does I doubt he'll be singing much.

cjd-3000s are EXACTLY the same as cdj-1000s, BUT they are in a 19" 
rackmount....so the jogwheel is a bit smaller....but you can still scratch 
on them or whatever makes ppl all hot for them...899 for them mofos...shit i 
might just go out and get the denon rackmount cd/mp3 player....thats like 
699...and it will work with mp3 files...which means you could put huge 
libraries on a few cds...just have to make sure everything is encoded at 
320...

ok Nick I choose your flame to respond to cuz I dislike yur junglist ass tha most.
SORRY for coming off so abrasive, to Danielle, I was drunk. This however does NOT change my opinion of CD DJs who DONT mix at all WHICH is what I was referring to, NOT DJs who actually mix tha CDs. I happen to know that any time I went to tha Matrix, G-Spot, Rock Jungle (cept Frankie Bones) tha resident DJs DO NOT mix and when they try to its Amtraks crashin everywhere. So to conclude, I say that CD DJs who dont mix or suck can piss off and if you dont like that too bad.  geez. You guys ALL still jump down my throat like old times.  And Matt B., youre still a fucking dork. peace. Chris

I'll be out, but every time someone organizes a net meet, no one ever comes.
Everyone's having to much fun to remember ;)

Hope to come across you guys out there. The weather's looking kinda shakey..

oh and btw...i was at g-spot this year...there were NO djs using cd-players 
to my recolection...

i dont know why you even bother with your little outbursts...what you said 
had fuck all to do with anything...and in the end you make yourself look 
stupid again...your opinion is what it is, but thats all it is, opinion...if 
you were actually making tunes you'd understand the value of a cd 
player...especially when you want to play your tunes out longside all the 
"hot" tunes

and considering that you do not dj, you really have no grounds to be saying 
who is a proper dj and who isnt...i know a good many ppl that will school 
you and alot of other ppl just using 2 cd players and a mixer with no 
eq's...

So my boss's boss bought the entire discography of Naked Music on 12" and
let me borrow them to make him some digital copies of them, it's some of the
most fun lounge music i've listened to.  I am just mentioning this because
I'll soon have digital copies of all the records (just FYI for anyone who
likes digital copies of music).  *cough* }}

the real question is where is the live chicken sacrifice going to be at this

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} help!!!

Nickelz intill you say one relevant thing on this list that shows some kind 
of intelligence you'll get no respect from me.  As to the comment to Jea, 
the only thing I can say is I don't know another person who is loved and 
respected more in the city of Cleveland or Pittsburgh.  I doubt youll be 
throwing shit at Pheonix, I'm sure youll be too busy sitting in the corner 
sucking on a binkie and macking on some 15 year old bitches by telling them 
how envolved in the scene you are.  If that doesnt work you can impress them 
with your broad knowledge of music.  I'm sure they will share the same love 
as you for Oakenfold and Keoki.

fine by me.  i'll see you all around 6am.  i'll want to collapse on a clean
surface though.  just keep that in mind, and hose that shit down before i
get there.

kelly's detroit tip of the day :  shots of jack daniels mixed with the
overpriced but tasty festival lemonade makes a refreshing thirst quencher.
every brand of liquor known to man is available right across the street and
up a block in a teeny tiny convenience store.  i think we spent $5,000 there
last year.

I was thinking of going, but there are some major "issues" that makes 
me unable to go.  Not even the fact I don't have any money, but since 
my medical insurance decided to drop me without telling me, then 
declining me when I went to reapply to go on my own after I've been 
with them my whole life and me still being pissed about it and you 
get the idea.  And then you get back to the basic problems like no 
money or tent.  And I'm too afraid to shack up with someone else 
because of some of the stories I've heard that happen inside the 
tents ;)

ohh well, have fun everyone.

Subject: {pb-cle} real DJ's vs. "wedding" DJ's... (was re: help!!)

<<He was an actual DJ, not a "wedding DJ." It made all the difference. He's on this list, in fact.>>

Personally, I hate most other DJ's. (the mobile/wedding/party type, not the EDM type, though there
are a few of those that are idiots as well) The vast majority of them are shady to the point of
being horrible businessmen (most remind me of the stereotypical 'used car salesman'...all they're
missing is the ugly plaid jacket with the suede elbow-patches), they have NO clue about using good
gear (Radio Shack mixers, for chrissake!), have no idea what good music is, and will find any way to
get paid as much as possible for doing as little as possible.

Speaking from personal experience though, it -IS- possible, though highly unlikely, to manage both
successfully and maintain some level of credibility. I, personally, have done both.

Weddings/school dances/private events are a good way to feed your habit. They're good work, keep you
in-touch with the "day people" and usually pay some pretty decent money. They're a little more work
in the "you have to bring all your own shit" department, and yes, there's a greater initial
investment, but doing that type of work has really helped me be a better DJ for the type of music
that I LIKE to play.

>>>actually this post would have been perfectly fine without the "shut the fuckup you retard" comment.

yea, don't get your panties in a twist. its a pissing contest. its a matter of personal pref always.  
and i can only tell you this.
i know its ALL digital in the mastering.  but, vinyl
does posses better, warmer aural properties than cd or mp3.
even though it all is mastered digitally.
and i can compare a software studio (reason) to a hardware set up. and i do prefer to mix (produce) on the outboard gear any day.  it is warmer and it just sounds better.  i would buy a hardware synth over a soft.  
and to comment on the whole cd mixing thing.
i purchased one of those dual tray pitch control cd players thinggies ten years ago. it lasted maybe a year.  then i traded it in for a vestax mixer.  i just don't like them and if i was promoter i would never hire a cd or finalskratch dj unless it was absolutely necessary.   i do realize it is at times like many goa dj mix this way cuz they say they cant find it on wax, but i beg to differ.  i find much goa on wax, apparently you just need to take the time to find it.  i guess its where your heart is...
please people it may seen like an easy way out (or in)
but think of it as preserving the "scene"
it is an artform and we should reward the labels artists and distributors for supporting this.  what are we going to do if pressing plants and distributors and the like close
for lack of vinyl sales.  you will be wishing it never happened.  i see them as the life force behind the culture and scene that keeps it pumping.  so please support it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} real DJ's vs. "wedding" DJ's... (was re: help!!)

I agree mark, I've done lots of 'charity' type events that generally
speaking have been more of the formal (read: chotch idiot) DJ required type
events, IE) the American Cancer Society Relay for Life 24 hour gig I did 2
weekends ago.  I brought something unexpected, I worked in as much GOOD
music as i could, while not worrying all that much about sticking to what
was mainstream music.  I did play alot of hip hop based music, as well as
old school hip hop, dance, 'fun' music (example: national lampoons - holiday
road) as well as lots of breakbeat and house, some jazzy types of music,
some reggae, and even a few atmospheric dnb tracks.  at the end of the
event, the coordinator told me that lots of people had commented to her that
they were really happy with the music and that it was nothing they had
expected.  It has since got me 4 gigs to play private parties, and also to
do another charity event this friday on short notice they cancelled their
original band in favor of hiring me this week.  It's opened me back up into
realizing that DJ'ing these 'inferior' events can be fun if you play GOOD
music and select the tracks to educate the crowd that you have.  DJ'ing
these type things had become something i dreaded after spinning the top
40/dance shit at banana joes and was stuck in a playlist for 2 years.  Now
I'm content with doing events that i still have artistic freedom with as
well as the crowds to enjoy it.

That's all i have now, i just brainfarted.

Anyone up for cocktails in someone's room?  I can possibly  offer up mine in the Pontchartrain - however I don't know if you need wristbands to get in there.. That and it may get too cramped..What about the underground stage somewhere?
 
I hear the weather is supposed to be crappy, so an indoor meet might be better..

not too sure where we should meet, but it
would be cool to try to netmeet somewhere..

possible locations - in the lawn near the lake,
(trouty mentioned some statue in that lawn),
to the left of the fountain if you are looking
at the lake, kelly's hotel room, the art gallery
(if they are going to do that this year) anywhere
else people suggest.

hahahhahhahaha... thats right Ive never had a binkie in my mouth ever and I dont hit on girls when I have a great girl that I love dearly that youre lame ass could never get anyway.  So beat it. As for Jea Leigh, as soon as she quits adding her two cents and her "me too" to all tha disagreements that I am involved in, I dont give a fuck about her.  And I will throw a tampon up there @ Phoenix... dont believe me? watch. and as for you lame ass...

throwing shit at Pheonix, I'm sure youll be too busy sitting in the corner 
sucking on a binkie and macking on some 15 year old bitches by telling them 
how envolved in the scene you are. If that doesnt work you can impress them

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} demf attendees

i think sunday night sounds like a good
idea, if we meet in the lounge, perhaps
we can all go get dinner somewhere. 

someone on the raverg list was kind enough
to post a list of dining options. i'll
look through that later this evening when
i am not subject to the hell of webmail. 

anyone else interested in dinner, by chance?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} help!!!

why is it so hard for many of you to see this point

if you are a producer...cd players are very very very useful...why spend
30-60 bux on a plate when you can try your tunes out on cd...if the tune
does well, then maybe you cut it to plate

in the end...nobody except the trainspotters know if you are dropping cds or
vinyl...and thats a fact.


Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

i just don't like them and if i was promoter i would never hire a cd or

if you are a producer...cd players are very very very useful...why spend
30-60 bux on a plate when you can try your tunes out on cd...if the tune

in the end...nobody except the trainspotters know if you are dropping cds or

i just don't like them and if i was promoter i would never hire a cd or

Nick S <hasnoplur@hotmail.com> wrote:why is it so hard for many of you to see this point

if you are a producer...cd players are very very very useful...why spend
30-60 bux on a plate when you can try your tunes out on cd...if the tune
does well, then maybe you cut it to plate

in the end...nobody except the trainspotters know if you are dropping cds or
vinyl...and thats a fact.

i just don't like them and if i was promoter i would never hire a cd or
finalskratch dj unless it was absolutely necessary. i do realize it is at
times like many goa dj mix this way cuz they say they cant find it on wax,
but i beg to differ. i find much goa on wax, apparently you just need to
take the time to find it. i guess its where your heart is...

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

headrushmusic presents
 
saturday, may 31
JOHN HOWARD (om records, san francisco)

Part Two of the Summer Series 2003
 
Join us for John's four-hour set.
 
John Howard is a legend in house music. He started DJing in 1993, during 
San Francisco’s infamous Summer of Love. John’s first regular appearances 
were at Groove Kitchen and the Boogie Buffet with Mark Farina. Then on to 
Stompy Stomp, Together with Dubtribe, Spundae, and Wicked.

John’s sound is smooth San Fran funk fused with a large dose of Chicago 
style, combined with his own brand of eclectic jazz and Bay Area 
influences. It’s always funky and it’s always different.

You've heard John rock it on the critically acclaimed SF Sessions Series 
from OM Records. And now he’s rising as a producer, with his track “Buddha 
Cowboy” appearing on OM’s 100th Release double CD.  Visit 
http://www.headrushmusic.com to listen to a mix set by John Howard and to 
read interviews with him.

Sat Jun 14                          SE7EN                           NE Ohio

On Saturday, June 14th, 2003 Unified Entertainment, Wishing Well, and 
Phareal Productions bring you up to Northeast Ohio again for.........

"SE7EN"

Pride, Anger, Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, and Lust.

These are the things that come between people in general, promoters, 
cities, and different scenes that end up destroying it if it isn't fixed. 
This event will feature djs from all over and the main theme is for us to 
look at what we do every day that might hurt our scene and work on 
changing it. We think that if we can all throw away the bickering and the 
arguing this area of Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Dayton, 
Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Indianapolis, Nashville, and any other 
cities that are involved in our scene every week will be the talk 
everywhere as the places to be or just the Midwest in general.

Sat Jun 14                     SOMETHING TO DO                   Pittsburgh

Something To Do

Tired of saying there is nothing to do? Tired of the same ol' same ol' 
rave atmosphere? Tired of Mc Donalds trying to come up with something new 
and innovative but all they come up with is the Mc Bratwurst? Well thats 
too bad...sucks to be you.

But we are having an event that is an effort to re-establish the 
pittsburgh scene by giving you "Something To Do". This will not be the 
typical rave, this wont be the typical club, and this wont be the typical 
not rave/not club. What we are trying to do is make this a bi-weekly event 
in which we bring in DJ's and or bands that YOU want to hear and that we 
can afford...not what these promoters think you want to hear. As well as 
bringing in what you want to hear, we also throw some new faces into the 
mix. I mean lets face it, it seems that every flyer you look at has the 
same DJ's, the same tag team specials and the same venues all of the time. 
Time for a change. Depending on the turn out of this first event, we will 
have an event where we bring the variety stylee every other saturday. Some 
of the things to do so far will be as follows:

Random Stuff FREE Raffles

Video Games

Answer a Trivia Question at the door and get $1 off (30 second time limit)

Vote for your favorite DJ of the night

Vote for local bands or djs that you would like to see at our event.

Vote for genres you would like to see more of at our event

Vote for the new president of Guam

Mainly we just want to hear your opinion, and give you something to do in 
this seemingly boring town.


The confirmed Dj's are as follows:

Cutups [Ragga] - Crazy ass ragga shit.

2rip [Not Trance] - Commin in with a suprise non trancey stylee

B Rivers [Hardcore] - Not that happy crap your mom gives you.

Jake vs. Dj Resolution (Faithindnb Systems) [DnB] - Wicked tag team from 
the up and comming big wigs.

E-ditty w/Mc Ja bless[DnB] - Thats right!! Ja bless comming the whole way 
from Flordia to rock it for you katz.

Dire Code [Screamo Hardcore Band]- Bringing the change up to the typical 
rave atmosphere, be sure to check them out.

Darkbert (Steel City Hardcore) [Experimental Thrashcore]- Bringing the 
craziness with a blend of noise and weird shit you've never heard before.

Price: $5 CHEAPER THAN 6.99!!!!!

Support us...we arent here to bank off of you, we are here to make things 
better for you. We do this for the people, not ourselves.

If you want to be heard, dont forget to bring demos!!!!!

P.S.- You know the drill, no DRUGS, no WEAPONS, no MARKERS, no NAKED 
PICTURES OF BEA ARTHUR, no CHEEZ WHIZ and TOWNHOUSE CRACKER 
SANDWITCHES..... because they will be taken from you.

Sat Jun 28                 ABASSO SUMMER SERIES 3                 Cleveland

headrushmusic presents

:: saturday, june 28 ::
:: part three of the summer series 2003 ::

JERRY BONHAM  (bedrock, renaissance, saw, spundae, san francisco)

Jerry Bonham, a pioneer in progressive, has been doing what he does best
for almost three decades. Jerry is a living legend - one of the true
beacons of electronic dance music.

Born in North Dakota, Jerry Bonham grew up listening to pop music from the
'70's, everything ranging from Barry White, and Sly to the Family Stone.  
In 1976 at the height of the Disco Era, Jerry ventured into Minneapolis,
where he began his DJing career. Later, Michael Graber, a Chicago DJ,
introduced Jerry to the infinite possibilities of mixing and live
composition, guided him away from simply being a mobile DJ. Instead of
playing only the hits like many fellow jockeys of that time, Jerry favored
the less-obvious works.

In 1988, he relocated from Minneapolis to San Francisco, where he became
engrossed in its local scene and fell in love with the people, the music
and the city. In early 1996, Jerry started his residency at San Fran's
super club Spundae/Nikita at 1015 Folsom. As the partnership grew, he
became co-owner of the Spundae Reckords Store located on Haight Street.

Jerry Bonham's DJing career on the dance floor skyrocketed during the late
'90's, his production standards paralleled the rise, hit after hit. In
1998, Jerry's first mix CD, "Interpretations," was released on Spundae
Recordings, followed by his celebrated 1999 release "Tranceglobalnation 3"
on Arcade America, one of Europe's most respected and influential
electronic dance music labels. "Interpretations II" is Jerry's latest mix
compilation released on Mute and Spundae Recordings. The CD was an instant
hit with 20,000 pre-sold copies.

In the recording studio, Jerry forged on to refine his progressive sound,
recording a remix of Expansion's "Listen" for the Texas based Funked-Up
Label. He is also part of the JSJ collective, also known as Jondi, Spesh,
and Jerry Bonham. Together, they recorded "Deep Love 9" and "Ghost of You"
on Renaissance; both tracks became the must-haves in a DJ's crate - two
absolute floor-fillers. In early 2001 Jerry recorded the single "Erendira"
(Spanish for "joy") with Planetary Consciousness on Bedrock. His recent
studio work is the solo track called "Seventh Seal", a 12-minute long
journey that opens with beautiful tunes and stripped drums, eventually
evolving into a complex web of progressive sounds and melodies.

John Digweed noted Jerry as a "world-class DJ", who "has been one of the
main pioneers of the progressive sound on the West Coast since the very
start, forever championing the latest sounds and pushing the music
forward." Dave Ralph added that Jerry is "the most underrated DJ in
America, who has real talent and depth."

Jerry Bonham has helped to define America's electronic dance music
movement with his flawless performances, and extraordinary production
skills.  Forever influencing the music, Jerry Bonham continues to love the
music as passionately as he lives and creates it.

Sat Jul 19                       JEDI NIGHT                          Toledo

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Jedi Night
July 19th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring Djs:

Josh the Funky 1 - Chicago, IL - House - Funktion Recordings , IHR, Kid
Dynamite Recordings

Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, and
breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks.

In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In
the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at the
Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.

Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh
has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , "Bangin the
Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

As if his DJ'ing accomplishments weren't enough, Josh has also had his
hand in the studio producing tracks for the infamous Chicago labels I.H.R,
Kid Dynamite, and Strictly Hype Recordings. His tracks have been featured
on mix compilations and DJ play-lists throughout the world, further
establishing his reputation as a DJ/Producer. Josh has also lent a hand in
remixing for Chicago's number one house diva, Dajae. Her first single on
Kid Dynamite records entitled "Time" is an uplifting vocal anthem that has
received Billboard attention and has since been licensed to Credence
records in U.K. Most Recently Josh has re-mixed Dajae's newest single
"Everyday", also on Kid Dynamite records and already licensed to Defected
Records U.K.

Not one to be content with only producing records for other labels. In
2001 "The Funky 1" launched his own record label, Funktion Recordings. The
first release "Everybody Everywhere" by BSJ and Fun-K has found its way
into the record boxes of DJ's worldwide.

2003 shows no signs of slowing down as producers such as Santos Scanty,
and Jelo continue to churn out dancefloor stormers for his label. When not
in the studio or running the label, Josh is constantly touring the world
bringing his sound and skills together for the masses.

E-Sassin - Los Angeles, CA - DnB - Sound Sphere Recordings, Phunkatek
Recordings, Just Two

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran of the
Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical journey in the
late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and jazz/fusion bands which
helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. After a short stint in
the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to the electronic dance
scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. "Once I started getting
into producing dance music, I finally felt I was on the right track to
where I wanted to be musically. My reputation as a cutting edge producer,
and later as a DJ, steadily grew, and so did the work.

In 1992 E-Sassin produced and self-released a techno album which got the
attention of Sunshine Records. They approached E-Sassin to work with the
groups L.A. Rave and The Movement. At this time The Movement's single,
"Jump Everybody Jump" was charting on Billboard's Hot 100 so for a year
and a half E-Sassin was touring with The Movement all over the world.
"During that time I was exposed to many different music scenes and
cultures. That's when I was first exposed to jungle. Jungle at that time
had just broken away from the breakbeat hardcore scene and what really
hooked me on the music was the way it combined the different styles of
music together with a more forward thinking use of technology. The intense
drum programming and the tweeking of sounds pushed the boundaries of the
available technology, which to me made it possible for new technology and
programming techniques to be created just to keep up with the demand.
That's progressive music by any definition" By 1996, E-Sassin had made the
transition into producing only drum and bass. "Even in '96 drum and bass
wasn't too widely accepted in the States and very few domestic labels were
releasing any of it, so I decided to start up my own label".

Sound Sphere Recordings came to light and the first two releases received
so much positive feedback, it quickly established a high level of
credibility for the label and for E-Sassin's productions. Subsequent
releases have continued to elevate Sound Sphere Recordings, which has
gained the label well earned respect from both American and European
artists. Sound Sphere Recordings is one of the pioneering West Coast
labels to be dedicated exclusively to drum and bass and continues to be a
leader in superior quality domestic pressings and high profile releases.
Currently, E-Sassin is producing and re-mixing tracks to be released on
Sound Sphere Recordings and other prospective labels. Recent works include
re-mixes of Tha Truth's, "Red Lights", which is featured on the mixed CD
"Urban Jungle", for Priority Records, UFO!'s, "Enemy Infiltration" from
Thermal Recordings forthcoming on Sound Sphere, and 60 Channels' "Give Me
Your Love" for World Domination Recordings. He is also a featured artist
on the much respected album, "The World of Drum & Bass" on Formation
Records, which showcases some of the best talent from around the world.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)

The time is 1200 hours the date is 10/18/03 and the location is Pittsburgh 
PA.  The company that brought you a revolutionary event is now back to 
bring you the much-anticipated sequel to a phenomenon that began 1 year 
ago.  We gave much thought about how we could improve our event from last 
year and we decided to eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes 
brutal outdoors so we moved the legacy that started it all indoors into a 
beautiful large facility located in the heart of the steel city. We wanted 
to assure everyone’s safety this year and keep our show as a one of kind 
superstar import car event.  Even though we wont be racing vehicles this 
year there will be tons of fun, and many different creative things going 
on.  I will have to keep you in suspense about most of the activities that 
we have planned until the time is right but I will give you brief taste of 
what is in store for SO2.  Picture an event like you have never witnessed 
before lights, visuals, sound, lasers, dancers, djs, mc’s, models, free 
stuff, contests, entertainers, many different automobile divisions, tons 
of cash prizes, a outdoor portion and indoor portion, and much more TBA!  
If you thought that Street Outlawz was as good as gets you won’t believe 
your eyes when SO2 hits the city. So prepare yourself for an event that 
will once again go down into the history of the Steel City!


ELECTRONIC MUSIC:
	(These are only a few of the major headliners that will be 
featured at the event please stay posted to our website 
www.steelcityracing.com for more detailed information)

DRUM N BASS:

FREAKY FLOW w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone can’t get enough of 
his outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If it’s not 
magazines then it’s live TV the Freaky Flow combination has truly been 
just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didn’t have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!




UFO! (Drum N Bass)
(Phracktel/ Phunckateck/ Phylum Recordings-SF)

The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!  Please don’t be alarmed by 
the name the aliens are not really coming.  However this is just one more 
incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he his mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that 
whenever he drops his dubs the dance floor will be screaming for more.  If 
you hadn’t had the chance to see this west coast legend then allow 
yourself the time to hit the dance floor at SO2 for an unforgettable 
musical experience!

AND MORE TBA!

HAPPY HARDCORE!

*Unfortunately we cannot disclose this highly confidential information at 
this time.  However we can say this what is coming is so big that all you 
happy hardcore kids better get your whistles ready and start shining them 
early because this headliner is a major ordeal and we promise it to be a 
once in the lifetime opportunity!


TRANCE

*Once again for security reasons we cannot release any information 
concerning this major headliner however we promise that you won’t be 
disappointed!  Keep in touch with our website to find out further updates 
www.steelcityracing.com

RYAN MATTHEWS-(Trance/Progressive Trance)
If it’s trance that you love then you won’t want to miss this outstanding 
Pittsburgh native by the name of Ryan Matthews.  This young superstar 
tears up the dance floor every time he hits the decks playing an 
outstanding selection of emotional and heart pounding trance that leaves 
you in a state of pure euphoria.  

E-DITTY- (Trance)
The dark haired maniac is back again he’s the player hater that you all 
love to hate!  But we keep bringing him back because of his prestigious 
mixing skills and loving attitude towards the music that he spins.  If you 
haven’t seen Eric’s performance before then you won’t to miss this very 
special set!

AND MORE TBA! 

BREAK BEATS

THE BREAK BEAT MILITA-(Break Beats)
If you are truly ready to indulge your mind beyond the realms of 
possibilities then come experience the 8th wonder of the world on 10-18-03 
when the militia makes a pit stop to the import car scene. Prepare 
yourself to see what four guys, five turntables, and three mixers can 
accomplish when they are put together in one room for 2hrs!

DR. Huxtable-(Live Break Beat PA!)
The doctor is making his return to the import car scene for another 
fantastic very rare all live performance.  This is another do not miss 
performer that adds to our obvious love for electronic music!

AND MORE TBA!

TWO STEP

Cheshire w/Mc Gravity-(2-step/Warren OH)
We gave much thought to this and we decided to choose one performer to 
strictly represent the 2 step scene and this performer is no other than 
the one the only DJ Cheshire! Chris a.k.a Cheshire is a one of kind 
performer his smooth intellectual attitude gives his style a unique 
separation that blows up dance floors every time he hits the stage.  The 
love of his music is obvious with the energy that he displays every time 
he drops another funky beat. We couldn’t get enough of this incredible 
performer from last year’s last event so we had to bring the crazy cat 
back again!

Jazz be Jazz?

Jazz be born out of early American music; opera, military marching bands, 
folk music, the blues, church music, ragtime and African drumming. A 
blending of all these came to be known as Jazz. Jazz be swinging in synch, 
it be improvising the sound of light, it be an expression of freedom, 
whether it be standard, avant-garde, ballads or be-bop, Jazz Be Jazz!

What is Mini M?

MINI m’s are miniature music festivals to test the waters and answer the 
question, is Pittsburgh ready for an International Music/Performance 
Festival along the likes of SXSW, and the Philly Fringe. What makes these 
festivals miniature, is that they are only for 2 days, whereas, most 
Festivals occur over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. MINI m’s focus on 
Pittsburgh’s regional talent in a concentrated manner. Our second 
festival, Jazz Be Jazz, will feature Pittsburgh’s emerging and established 
artists, creating momentum for a new community based jazz festival in the 
city's east end.
 

The
Mini-M Jazz Be Jazz
Festival

keep your good vibes strong!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DEMF

Yeah, that forecast looks pretty bleak, especially for Friday and Monday.
Has anyone from Detroit heard any different? :-(

My brother Todd and I would be up for a net meet dinner or something on
Sunday night. Give us a jingle: (cell) (816) 309-2678.

BTW, if you haven't reserved a hotel room yet, try the hotels in Dearborn
and Southfield. I lucked out and got a room in DT yesterday, but all the
main hotels listed on the DEMF site were full. There are rooms at the Days
Inn, but it is supposedly really ghetto.

The schedule is up on the movement festival web site, if you haven't checked
it out yet. I still can not figure out what possesses the organizers to
always put the feature headliner on at the very end of Monday night. Don't
they realize that many attendees are traveling and will need ot leave before
midnight on Monday???

Hey everyone I will be staying at the shorecrest hotel.  I dont' know where 
quite yet.

If anyone needs to call just ring me up at 859 489 4438.  Yeah its probably 
crazy to put my digits online but hey, I might get my very own stalker!!  :) 
:)

But seriously if anyone wants to meet up that would be dope.  Sunday I am 
down for 5 30.  The fest is kinda dull IMO on sunday so I will probably be 
looking around town for stuff or just chilling.

It's another one of those rotation scenarios - recycle, remix, 
re-incarnate... of minds and machines, the only different is flava...

the matrix reloaded was pretty tame, but the over arching vision is 
still pretty solid. It was hilarious to see Cornell West querying 
Lawrence Fishbourne as an "elder of Zion" but hey.... who's counting. 
I guess Cornell, like Mr. Smith in the movie, is now a "free agent."

The Matrix way of knowledge
 From the Gnostic gospels to the visions of Descartes to the shamanic 
quests of Eastern mystics, the Wachowski brothers' pop opus weaves a 
dense web of philosophical and metaphysical allusions.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Erik Davis

May 21, 2003  |  The most curious feature of Warner Bros' official 
Matrix Web site is not the handful of jaw-dropping "Animatrix" clips, 
but the collection of high-quality philosophical essays by heavy 
hitters like Hubert Dreyfus, Colin McGinn and the cognitive science 
superstar David Chalmers. These essays, which hash out Descartes, 
Mahayana Buddhism and the proverbial "brain in the vat" problem, are 
all the evidence you need that the Wachowski brothers' original 1999 
film has vaulted into that curious category of Big Think mainstream 
sci-fi films -- and that they want the "kickass" sequel to extend the 
beard-pulling.

No one is surprised when filmmakers like Andrei Tarkovsky or Chris 
Marker or Stanley Kubrick use future shtick for metaphysical 
purposes, but it's another thing for Hollywood action fare -- 
designed to reap big bucks from the popcorn crowd -- to create a 
space of inquiry into philosophical, political and spiritual 
questions, however "comic book" the frame. Movies like "Blade 
Runner," "Robocop," "They Live," "Minority Report" and the "Alien" 
and "Terminator" flicks have managed, sometimes through no fault of 
their own, to edge toward the profound. But the Wachowski brothers 
made it to the top of this heap with the most lucrative sci-fi action 
empire to feed the questioning, and questing, mind.

Now, with demiurgic ambitions matched only by "Lord of the Rings" 
director Peter Jackson, the brothers have unveiled the next chapter 
of their live-action post-apocalyptic anime franchise. As a movie, 
"The Matrix Reloaded" has some serious flaws: Many sequences drag, 
the pacing is jangled and there are far too many dreadlocks. But I 
have no problems with the pretentious, concept-heavy dialogue. Some 
reviewers imply that this metaphysical kitsch detracts from the fun; 
for some of us, it is the fun. At one point in the new film Neo 
returns to the Matrix and wanders through a street market full of 
religious junk: chintzy Mother Maries, head-shop Shiva posters, and 
blinking Jesus plaques. This is the pop carnival of souls where the 
Matrix films rightly take their place -- the flea market of genre 
movies and rumors of God that, for many these days, is the only 
portal left into the meaning of it all. In the words of Philip K. 
Dick, whose spirit (but not tone) hangs over the Matrix, "The symbols 
of the divine initially show up at the trash stratum."

The Wachowski brothers may be too self-conscious about their divine 
trash, but in the end that's what feels true, or at least 
contemporary, about the Matrix films: their excessive 
self-consciousness about selves and consciousness. The original 
"Matrix" hit home by digitally remastering a time-honored (because 
always timely) conundrum: How do I know that reality is not a total 
illusion? Though this question gives off a cheesy adolescent fizz, 
it's more than a stoned gedanken experiment, like Pinto's speculation 
in "Animal House" that our entire universe might be an atom in some 
all-being's fingernail. The question lies at the heart, at least, of 
Western epistemology, with Descartes.


In order to escape medieval authority and embrace the proud autonomy 
of the rational "I," Descartes battled a "demon of doubt" that 
undermined everything it could, including the reality of the world 
before the philosopher's eyes. Descartes' skepticism, with its sci-fi 
scenarios of false worlds and automatons disguised as human beings, 
initiated a revolution in thinking that, in some sense, ultimately 
leads to the universal machines that sit on our particular desks. The 
Matrix, with its mathematicized objects and Cartesian coordinates, is 
really Descartes' storyboard.

Descartes dreamed great dreams as well -- like the angel who appeared 
to him one September night, proclaiming, "The conquest of nature is 
to be achieved through measure and number." Most of us have such 
veridical dreams on occasion, when visionary Technicolor truths burst 
through the usual REM murk. At the very least, the power of these 
dreams reminds us that the "false reality" problem strikes a far 
deeper note than skepticism alone can sound. Millenniums ago, human 
beings had to face the fact that our minds regularly pass through 
realms very different from the seemingly solid world, however we 
choose to interpret them. In other words, the Matrix problem arises 
from our wetware's capacity, through dreams, drugs or trance, to boot 
up radically different worlds of consciousness. That's why Descartes' 
skepticism still resonates with cultural narratives as different as 
Hindu folklore or Gnostic myth or the Taoist Zhuangzi's famous quip 
(intended with more comedy than I think we now hear): "How do I know 
I am a man dreaming he was a butterfly, and not a butterfly dreaming 
he is a man?"

The Matrix problem becomes particularly unavoidable in the age of 
virtual technologies, which constantly narrate their own totalizing 
dreams of "world-building" and "experience design." Of course, media 
have long sought to create immersive spaces of fictional reality: 
Baroque cathedrals, 19th century panoramas, even, perhaps, the 
Paleolithic caves of Lascaux or Altamira. Today, the accelerating 
perceptual technologies of media are on a collision course with 
cognitive science and its understanding of how the human nervous 
system produces the real-time matrix we take for ordinary space-time. 
So we should not be surprised at the massive popularity of a 
Hollywood slug-fest where dream and reality and virtual technology 
enfold one another. Not only does the film mythologize the game-world 
aspirations of so much popular media, it stimulates the corresponding 
desire to crack through -- and remake -- the construct.


What was particularly savvy about the Wachowskis' comic-book movie 
was that its mirror-shade cool reflected any number of readings -- 
Marxist, Lacanian, utterly stoned. Perhaps most surprising, and 
influential, was its use of religious symbols and viewpoints. Most 
viewers picked up on the Christian elements of the first film, which 
center on Neo's role as a savior figure, but the deep frame of both 
movies is a more esoteric pop stew of Gnostic and Buddhist ideas. The 
Gnostics of antiquity transformed the analogy of Plato's cave into a 
full-blown and harrowing cosmology: We are strangers trapped in a 
strange land, they argued, immortal sparks slumbering in a material 
cosmos fashioned by an evil or ignorant demiurge and his nefarious 
archons. The Buddhist analysis is less personalistic: We are stuck on 
the delusive merry-go-round of samsara, an almost mechanical system 
of causes and conditions that fools us into believing the self and 
the world are substantially real. In both cases, we step toward the 
light not through grace or the remission of sins, but through the 
direct awakening of insight into our condition. Neo must swallow his 
pill and take the ride himself.

Opening in theaters on Buddha's birthday, "The Matrix Reloaded" 
clearly places itself in a crypto-religious landscape. There's a ship 
called the Logos, characters like Seraph and Persephone and Neo's 
hushed worship by the multiculti masses of Zion. Neo's mystic powers 
are growing as well: His "second sight," which allows him to see into 
the underlying code inside the Matrix, lets him read energy bodies 
and, in a remarkable fusion of Christ myth and shamanism, resurrect 
Trinity by removing a bullet embedded in her body. But "The Matrix 
Reloaded" would have been lame if it had simply followed its Gnostic 
bodhisattva superhero around as he kicked ass in Jesuit robes. 
Instead, to keep the cognitive sparkle, the Wachowskis altered the 
conceptual maps of the two worlds that Neo moves through: Zion and 
the Matrix.

In the first film, these two worlds had the virtue of simplicity: We 
slipped neatly between the world of the Matrix, with its single 
nefarious agenda, and the revolutionary messianic world of Morpheus' 
ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. But "The Matrix Reloaded" complicates these 
two worlds. Before the Nebuchadnezzar even arrives at Zion, we 
realize that Morpheus -- previously the hierophantic voice of truth 
-- may simply be crazy, an irrational demagogue, a renegade believer. 
Meanwhile, the Matrix grows far more complex. In the first film we 
sensed a unity of purpose and design behind the agents and their 
urban landscape, but now we confront a Babel of programs: rogue 
self-replicating agents, the power-mad Merovingian, the intuitive 
Oracle, all competing in an open-ended nest of potentially infinite 
regress. As the Oracle admits to Neo, it's a pickle: There's no way 
for him to know what's going on or whom to believe.

The Matrix comes to resemble the multifarious world of shamanism 
rather than the black-and-white world of the Christian afterlife. 
Neo, the otherworldly voyager, encounters a wide variety of beings, 
each with his or her own contradictory raps and agendas, and none 
entirely trustworthy. The architecture of the Matrix has also become 
pickled, an Escheresque Swiss cheese of transdimensional hallways and 
quantum portals. If "The Matrix" was all about screens and mirror 
shades, "The Matrix Reloaded" is all about keys and doors. The keys 
are codes of course, the language of encryption, but they are also 
the keys of magicians navigating through angel-space. And the portals 
we keep passing through remind us that the action lies between the 
worlds, as the conventional cartography of the Matrix melts into the 
metamorphic palaces of dream.

After all, however much you resonate with the cabalistic or Marxist 
metaphors, the Matrix most resembles the shifting virtual worlds that 
our brain conjures nightly. The first glimpse that "The Matrix 
Reloaded" gives us of the Matrix -- when Trinity falls to her 
apparent demise beneath a rain of bullets -- turns out to be a 
recurrent dream in Neo's head. What makes this dream a nightmare is 
not just Trinity's death, but Neo's own inability to intervene in the 
scenario. We've all gotten caught in these hypnagogic snares, where 
you face some horror but cannot move -- encased, as it were, in the 
amber of dream time. What we want in these moments is the secret wish 
whose fulfillment animates these films: the desire to awaken inside 
the phantom world and wrest control from the dream machine.

On this level of psychic control, both Matrix films can be read as 
instruction manuals for lucid dreamers. As the first film suggests, 
the simple knowledge that one is dreaming is not usually enough to 
exert control on the illusory world; instead, one achieves full 
creative action only after a lot of training in the dreaming dojo. 
The first thing that a lot of dreamers do when they first go lucid is 
also one of the first visual pleasures "The Matrix Reloaded" gives 
us: flight. Neo's bat-winged cruise through the moonstruck heavens is 
not just a Superman reference, but also a specific invocation of our 
own dream experience. This is what people don't understand about the 
Wachowskis' special effects, many of which revolve around virtual 
camera moves impossible to generate in the real world. Remember the 
subconscious equation of film: I am the camera. When the Wachowskis 
propel their camera faster than a speeding bullet, when it swoops and 
dives with angelic grace or whips through a frozen moment of 
space-time -- these novel perceptions strike us at first as virtual 
experiences, familiar only through dream time or trance.


Of course, the novelty of these effects wears off fast, and we soon 
assimilate the technique as mere technological rhetoric. "Bullet 
Time" sells beer now; we are not impressed. Our rapidly jaded eyes 
drive the arms race of special effects, a race that suggests that we 
will not be satisfied until we somehow break through and manipulate 
space itself -- a pleasure now increasingly available through 
computer games, like the Wachowskis' own "Enter the Matrix." As in 
lucid dreams, the question is all about control, a control that 
necessarily implies a certain technical disenchantment. We can 
control our dreams when we recognize they are merely dreams, just as 
we can create the "magic" of FX only with the total mathematicization 
of space-time and the images of human bodies.

The Matrix films are not neo-Luddite propaganda; the Wachowski 
brothers recognize that technology accompanies all our dreams. Early 
in the film, an insomniac Neo wanders through the depths of Zion as 
Councilor Hamann draws his attention to an irony only implicit in the 
first film: The good guys also depend utterly on machines. In their 
stilted chat, Neo differentiates between the Matrix and Zion's 
technological infrastructure, a steam-punk space of Tesla-coil arc 
lights and corroded "Modern Times" gears that looks back to the 
organic textures of the last century. Neo implies that Zion is free 
because humans have control. But this 19th century romance only 
raises the question Hamann asks him: "What is control?"

This question is not just the nut of the movie. It is the central 
koan of our cybernetic civilization and its ever more intricate 
symbiosis with algorithms, control systems and the kind of 
self-replicating bots suggested by Agent Smith. All the 
representatives of the Matrix, even the Oracle, continually suggest 
that conscious human agency is not what it's cracked up to be. During 
his first balletic bash with Neo, Smith, though now apparently a 
"free agent" like Neo, insists that everything is determined by its 
purpose. He does not use the term as Morpheus later does, to suggest 
destiny or a higher calling. Instead, he means a techno-Darwinian 
logic, a programmed calculus of success. His is the voice of the 
evolutionary psychologist, who delights in deconstructing our most 
spirited social actions in terms of the base advantage they confer. 
This is also the perspective of the Merovingian, who comes off as a 
curious hybrid between "Jesus Christ Superstar's" Herod and Pilate. 
With the aphrodisiac piece of pie he feeds a future fuck-bunny, the 
Merovingian raises the distinct glandular possibility that "decision" 
is simply the story the brain tells itself about the neural cascades 
of electrochemical reactions that underlie behavior. Code rules: 
Despite appearances, we are out of control.

As mythographers, the Wachowski brothers realize that the cybernetic 
problem of control reboots the hoary old struggle between freedom and 
fate. Morpheus, for example, is convinced that everything is 
proceeding according to cosmic plan, but his increasingly tedious 
speechifying about destiny and prophecy weirdly mirrors Agent Smith's 
grim talk of mechanical purpose. What, then, is the proper rejoinder 
to determinism? The Oracle tells Neo that "You are here to understand 
why you made the choice, not to make the choice." I take this to mean 
that, to an awakened one, events and decisions have always already 
occurred, but that understanding and compassion can still dissolve 
their karmic hold.

OK, enough already. It's silly to squeeze too many meanings from a 
cyber-chopsocky flick; as in the anime tradition the Wachowskis draw 
from, metaphysical puzzles are more for atmosphere than answers. I 
won't even get into Neo's final chat with the Architect, although I 
suspect that all the talk of anomalies and contingent affirmations 
won't really add up in the end. But adding up is not really the point 
(unless you are talking about adding up the merchandise sold to fans 
who want to spend as much time as possible in the Wachowskis' 
endlessly nested construct). Like the overly complex plots of film 
noir, which ultimately serve only to increase the vibe of 
claustrophobic paranoia, "The Matrix Reloaded's" fractured chatter is 
in service of an old Gnostic hunch: There is a crack in the cosmic 
machine, and we are the crack.

As I left the theater after watching the new film, I was handed a 
slick little flier. "Take the Red Pill," it said. "Join the 
Resistance." At first I thought it was a Christian tract, but it was 
Not in Our Name's clever attempt at a wake-up call for a very sleepy 
nation. Here are the truths the tract's authors offered: slaughtered 
Iraqis, Orwellian homeland security, deportations and military 
tribunals, endless war and repression. But they also saw a light at 
the end of the rabbit hole. "Another world is possible and we pledge 
to make it real," they said. "Join us." They listed some numbers, and 
I impulsively looked around for the nearest public phone, as if I 
were Clark Kent, or Neo trying to slip back out of the Matrix. I 
didn't see one. They're not easy to find these days.

Hello,

I stopped going to parties in 2000 i think...well I saw Hawtin in 2001 =

I really miss the scene though, and wondered if it's still like it used =

again.. Hopefully I can stick around.

Check out the prequel to Dune, "The Butlerean Jihad".  Kind of paralells =
the Matrix in the theory of man v. machine, man v. man, and man v. =
religion.

Plus it's a book that I couldn't put down, read the whole thing in about =

   From the Gnostic gospels to the visions of Descartes to the shamanic=20
  quests of Eastern mystics, the Wachowski brothers' pop opus weaves a=20
  dense web of philosophical and metaphysical allusions.

  - - - - - - - - - - - -
  By Erik Davis

  May 21, 2003  |  The most curious feature of Warner Bros' official=20
  Matrix Web site is not the handful of jaw-dropping "Animatrix" clips,=20
  but the collection of high-quality philosophical essays by heavy=20
  hitters like Hubert Dreyfus, Colin McGinn and the cognitive science=20
  superstar David Chalmers. These essays, which hash out Descartes,=20
  Mahayana Buddhism and the proverbial "brain in the vat" problem, are=20
  all the evidence you need that the Wachowski brothers' original 1999=20
  film has vaulted into that curious category of Big Think mainstream=20
  sci-fi films -- and that they want the "kickass" sequel to extend the=20
  beard-pulling.

  No one is surprised when filmmakers like Andrei Tarkovsky or Chris=20
  Marker or Stanley Kubrick use future shtick for metaphysical=20
  purposes, but it's another thing for Hollywood action fare --=20
  designed to reap big bucks from the popcorn crowd -- to create a=20
  space of inquiry into philosophical, political and spiritual=20
  questions, however "comic book" the frame. Movies like "Blade=20
  Runner," "Robocop," "They Live," "Minority Report" and the "Alien"=20
  and "Terminator" flicks have managed, sometimes through no fault of=20
  their own, to edge toward the profound. But the Wachowski brothers=20
  made it to the top of this heap with the most lucrative sci-fi action=20
  empire to feed the questioning, and questing, mind.

  Now, with demiurgic ambitions matched only by "Lord of the Rings"=20
  director Peter Jackson, the brothers have unveiled the next chapter=20
  of their live-action post-apocalyptic anime franchise. As a movie,=20
  "The Matrix Reloaded" has some serious flaws: Many sequences drag,=20
  the pacing is jangled and there are far too many dreadlocks. But I=20
  have no problems with the pretentious, concept-heavy dialogue. Some=20
  reviewers imply that this metaphysical kitsch detracts from the fun;=20
  for some of us, it is the fun. At one point in the new film Neo=20
  returns to the Matrix and wanders through a street market full of=20
  religious junk: chintzy Mother Maries, head-shop Shiva posters, and=20
  blinking Jesus plaques. This is the pop carnival of souls where the=20
  Matrix films rightly take their place -- the flea market of genre=20
  movies and rumors of God that, for many these days, is the only=20
  portal left into the meaning of it all. In the words of Philip K.=20
  Dick, whose spirit (but not tone) hangs over the Matrix, "The symbols=20
  of the divine initially show up at the trash stratum."

  The Wachowski brothers may be too self-conscious about their divine=20
  trash, but in the end that's what feels true, or at least=20
  contemporary, about the Matrix films: their excessive=20
  self-consciousness about selves and consciousness. The original=20
  "Matrix" hit home by digitally remastering a time-honored (because=20
  always timely) conundrum: How do I know that reality is not a total=20
  illusion? Though this question gives off a cheesy adolescent fizz,=20
  it's more than a stoned gedanken experiment, like Pinto's speculation=20
  in "Animal House" that our entire universe might be an atom in some=20
  all-being's fingernail. The question lies at the heart, at least, of=20
  Western epistemology, with Descartes.


  In order to escape medieval authority and embrace the proud autonomy=20
  of the rational "I," Descartes battled a "demon of doubt" that=20
  undermined everything it could, including the reality of the world=20
  before the philosopher's eyes. Descartes' skepticism, with its sci-fi=20
  scenarios of false worlds and automatons disguised as human beings,=20
  initiated a revolution in thinking that, in some sense, ultimately=20
  leads to the universal machines that sit on our particular desks. The=20
  Matrix, with its mathematicized objects and Cartesian coordinates, is=20
  really Descartes' storyboard.

  Descartes dreamed great dreams as well -- like the angel who appeared=20
  to him one September night, proclaiming, "The conquest of nature is=20
  to be achieved through measure and number." Most of us have such=20
  veridical dreams on occasion, when visionary Technicolor truths burst=20
  through the usual REM murk. At the very least, the power of these=20
  dreams reminds us that the "false reality" problem strikes a far=20
  deeper note than skepticism alone can sound. Millenniums ago, human=20
  beings had to face the fact that our minds regularly pass through=20
  realms very different from the seemingly solid world, however we=20
  choose to interpret them. In other words, the Matrix problem arises=20
  from our wetware's capacity, through dreams, drugs or trance, to boot=20
  up radically different worlds of consciousness. That's why Descartes'=20
  skepticism still resonates with cultural narratives as different as=20
  Hindu folklore or Gnostic myth or the Taoist Zhuangzi's famous quip=20
  (intended with more comedy than I think we now hear): "How do I know=20
  I am a man dreaming he was a butterfly, and not a butterfly dreaming=20
  he is a man?"

  The Matrix problem becomes particularly unavoidable in the age of=20
  virtual technologies, which constantly narrate their own totalizing=20
  dreams of "world-building" and "experience design." Of course, media=20
  have long sought to create immersive spaces of fictional reality:=20
  Baroque cathedrals, 19th century panoramas, even, perhaps, the=20
  Paleolithic caves of Lascaux or Altamira. Today, the accelerating=20
  perceptual technologies of media are on a collision course with=20
  cognitive science and its understanding of how the human nervous=20
  system produces the real-time matrix we take for ordinary space-time.=20
  So we should not be surprised at the massive popularity of a=20
  Hollywood slug-fest where dream and reality and virtual technology=20
  enfold one another. Not only does the film mythologize the game-world=20
  aspirations of so much popular media, it stimulates the corresponding=20
  desire to crack through -- and remake -- the construct.


  What was particularly savvy about the Wachowskis' comic-book movie=20
  was that its mirror-shade cool reflected any number of readings --=20
  Marxist, Lacanian, utterly stoned. Perhaps most surprising, and=20
  influential, was its use of religious symbols and viewpoints. Most=20
  viewers picked up on the Christian elements of the first film, which=20
  center on Neo's role as a savior figure, but the deep frame of both=20
  movies is a more esoteric pop stew of Gnostic and Buddhist ideas. The=20
  Gnostics of antiquity transformed the analogy of Plato's cave into a=20
  full-blown and harrowing cosmology: We are strangers trapped in a=20
  strange land, they argued, immortal sparks slumbering in a material=20
  cosmos fashioned by an evil or ignorant demiurge and his nefarious=20
  archons. The Buddhist analysis is less personalistic: We are stuck on=20
  the delusive merry-go-round of samsara, an almost mechanical system=20
  of causes and conditions that fools us into believing the self and=20
  the world are substantially real. In both cases, we step toward the=20
  light not through grace or the remission of sins, but through the=20
  direct awakening of insight into our condition. Neo must swallow his=20
  pill and take the ride himself.

  Opening in theaters on Buddha's birthday, "The Matrix Reloaded"=20
  clearly places itself in a crypto-religious landscape. There's a ship=20
  called the Logos, characters like Seraph and Persephone and Neo's=20
  hushed worship by the multiculti masses of Zion. Neo's mystic powers=20
  are growing as well: His "second sight," which allows him to see into=20
  the underlying code inside the Matrix, lets him read energy bodies=20
  and, in a remarkable fusion of Christ myth and shamanism, resurrect=20
  Trinity by removing a bullet embedded in her body. But "The Matrix=20
  Reloaded" would have been lame if it had simply followed its Gnostic=20
  bodhisattva superhero around as he kicked ass in Jesuit robes.=20
  Instead, to keep the cognitive sparkle, the Wachowskis altered the=20
  conceptual maps of the two worlds that Neo moves through: Zion and=20
  the Matrix.

  In the first film, these two worlds had the virtue of simplicity: We=20
  slipped neatly between the world of the Matrix, with its single=20
  nefarious agenda, and the revolutionary messianic world of Morpheus'=20
  ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. But "The Matrix Reloaded" complicates these=20
  two worlds. Before the Nebuchadnezzar even arrives at Zion, we=20
  realize that Morpheus -- previously the hierophantic voice of truth=20
  -- may simply be crazy, an irrational demagogue, a renegade believer.=20
  Meanwhile, the Matrix grows far more complex. In the first film we=20
  sensed a unity of purpose and design behind the agents and their=20
  urban landscape, but now we confront a Babel of programs: rogue=20
  self-replicating agents, the power-mad Merovingian, the intuitive=20
  Oracle, all competing in an open-ended nest of potentially infinite=20
  regress. As the Oracle admits to Neo, it's a pickle: There's no way=20
  for him to know what's going on or whom to believe.

  The Matrix comes to resemble the multifarious world of shamanism=20
  rather than the black-and-white world of the Christian afterlife.=20
  Neo, the otherworldly voyager, encounters a wide variety of beings,=20
  each with his or her own contradictory raps and agendas, and none=20
  entirely trustworthy. The architecture of the Matrix has also become=20
  pickled, an Escheresque Swiss cheese of transdimensional hallways and=20
  quantum portals. If "The Matrix" was all about screens and mirror=20
  shades, "The Matrix Reloaded" is all about keys and doors. The keys=20
  are codes of course, the language of encryption, but they are also=20
  the keys of magicians navigating through angel-space. And the portals=20
  we keep passing through remind us that the action lies between the=20
  worlds, as the conventional cartography of the Matrix melts into the=20
  metamorphic palaces of dream.

  After all, however much you resonate with the cabalistic or Marxist=20
  metaphors, the Matrix most resembles the shifting virtual worlds that=20
  our brain conjures nightly. The first glimpse that "The Matrix=20
  Reloaded" gives us of the Matrix -- when Trinity falls to her=20
  apparent demise beneath a rain of bullets -- turns out to be a=20
  recurrent dream in Neo's head. What makes this dream a nightmare is=20
  not just Trinity's death, but Neo's own inability to intervene in the=20
  scenario. We've all gotten caught in these hypnagogic snares, where=20
  you face some horror but cannot move -- encased, as it were, in the=20
  amber of dream time. What we want in these moments is the secret wish=20
  whose fulfillment animates these films: the desire to awaken inside=20
  the phantom world and wrest control from the dream machine.

  On this level of psychic control, both Matrix films can be read as=20
  instruction manuals for lucid dreamers. As the first film suggests,=20
  the simple knowledge that one is dreaming is not usually enough to=20
  exert control on the illusory world; instead, one achieves full=20
  creative action only after a lot of training in the dreaming dojo.=20
  The first thing that a lot of dreamers do when they first go lucid is=20
  also one of the first visual pleasures "The Matrix Reloaded" gives=20
  us: flight. Neo's bat-winged cruise through the moonstruck heavens is=20
  not just a Superman reference, but also a specific invocation of our=20
  own dream experience. This is what people don't understand about the=20
  Wachowskis' special effects, many of which revolve around virtual=20
  camera moves impossible to generate in the real world. Remember the=20
  subconscious equation of film: I am the camera. When the Wachowskis=20
  propel their camera faster than a speeding bullet, when it swoops and=20
  dives with angelic grace or whips through a frozen moment of=20
  space-time -- these novel perceptions strike us at first as virtual=20
  experiences, familiar only through dream time or trance.


  Of course, the novelty of these effects wears off fast, and we soon=20
  assimilate the technique as mere technological rhetoric. "Bullet=20
  Time" sells beer now; we are not impressed. Our rapidly jaded eyes=20
  drive the arms race of special effects, a race that suggests that we=20
  will not be satisfied until we somehow break through and manipulate=20
  space itself -- a pleasure now increasingly available through=20
  computer games, like the Wachowskis' own "Enter the Matrix." As in=20
  lucid dreams, the question is all about control, a control that=20
  necessarily implies a certain technical disenchantment. We can=20
  control our dreams when we recognize they are merely dreams, just as=20
  we can create the "magic" of FX only with the total mathematicization=20
  of space-time and the images of human bodies.

  The Matrix films are not neo-Luddite propaganda; the Wachowski=20
  brothers recognize that technology accompanies all our dreams. Early=20
  in the film, an insomniac Neo wanders through the depths of Zion as=20
  Councilor Hamann draws his attention to an irony only implicit in the=20
  first film: The good guys also depend utterly on machines. In their=20
  stilted chat, Neo differentiates between the Matrix and Zion's=20
  technological infrastructure, a steam-punk space of Tesla-coil arc=20
  lights and corroded "Modern Times" gears that looks back to the=20
  organic textures of the last century. Neo implies that Zion is free=20
  because humans have control. But this 19th century romance only=20
  raises the question Hamann asks him: "What is control?"

  This question is not just the nut of the movie. It is the central=20
  koan of our cybernetic civilization and its ever more intricate=20
  symbiosis with algorithms, control systems and the kind of=20
  self-replicating bots suggested by Agent Smith. All the=20
  representatives of the Matrix, even the Oracle, continually suggest=20
  that conscious human agency is not what it's cracked up to be. During=20
  his first balletic bash with Neo, Smith, though now apparently a=20
  "free agent" like Neo, insists that everything is determined by its=20
  purpose. He does not use the term as Morpheus later does, to suggest=20
  destiny or a higher calling. Instead, he means a techno-Darwinian=20
  logic, a programmed calculus of success. His is the voice of the=20
  evolutionary psychologist, who delights in deconstructing our most=20
  spirited social actions in terms of the base advantage they confer.=20
  This is also the perspective of the Merovingian, who comes off as a=20
  curious hybrid between "Jesus Christ Superstar's" Herod and Pilate.=20
  With the aphrodisiac piece of pie he feeds a future fuck-bunny, the=20
  Merovingian raises the distinct glandular possibility that "decision"=20
  is simply the story the brain tells itself about the neural cascades=20
  of electrochemical reactions that underlie behavior. Code rules:=20
  Despite appearances, we are out of control.

  As mythographers, the Wachowski brothers realize that the cybernetic=20
  problem of control reboots the hoary old struggle between freedom and=20
  fate. Morpheus, for example, is convinced that everything is=20
  proceeding according to cosmic plan, but his increasingly tedious=20
  speechifying about destiny and prophecy weirdly mirrors Agent Smith's=20
  grim talk of mechanical purpose. What, then, is the proper rejoinder=20
  to determinism? The Oracle tells Neo that "You are here to understand=20
  why you made the choice, not to make the choice." I take this to mean=20
  that, to an awakened one, events and decisions have always already=20
  occurred, but that understanding and compassion can still dissolve=20
  their karmic hold.

  OK, enough already. It's silly to squeeze too many meanings from a=20
  cyber-chopsocky flick; as in the anime tradition the Wachowskis draw=20
  from, metaphysical puzzles are more for atmosphere than answers. I=20
  won't even get into Neo's final chat with the Architect, although I=20
  suspect that all the talk of anomalies and contingent affirmations=20
  won't really add up in the end. But adding up is not really the point=20
  (unless you are talking about adding up the merchandise sold to fans=20
  who want to spend as much time as possible in the Wachowskis'=20
  endlessly nested construct). Like the overly complex plots of film=20

  claustrophobic paranoia, "The Matrix Reloaded's" fractured chatter is=20
  in service of an old Gnostic hunch: There is a crack in the cosmic=20
  machine, and we are the crack.

  As I left the theater after watching the new film, I was handed a=20
  slick little flier. "Take the Red Pill," it said. "Join the=20

  Not in Our Name's clever attempt at a wake-up call for a very sleepy=20
  nation. Here are the truths the tract's authors offered: slaughtered=20
  Iraqis, Orwellian homeland security, deportations and military=20
  tribunals, endless war and repression. But they also saw a light at=20
  the end of the rabbit hole. "Another world is possible and we pledge=20
  to make it real," they said. "Join us." They listed some numbers, and=20
  I impulsively looked around for the nearest public phone, as if I=20
  were Clark Kent, or Neo trying to slip back out of the Matrix. I=20
  didn't see one. They're not easy to find these days.

I stopped going to parties in 2000 i think...well I saw Hawtin in 2001 maybe

fell apart. }}

Are you insinuating a causal relationship here? What is your conjecture?

I really miss the scene though, and wondered if it's still like it used to
be, or better? That's my main reason for signing up to this list again..
Hopefully I can stick around. }}

"The Scene" has splintered into many pieces that still remain rave-like but
fail to capture the quintessence of what most people found so captivating in
the 90's. Some of these pieces are decidely hedonic, others snooty and
pretentious. On any given saturday you might find people standing around
clutching cocktails with one hand and gesturing with the other, or you might
find sparkle-coated teens flailing amidst a sea of overdriven sound.

I don't know how it "used to be" for you, but chances are that it's not
entirely like you remember it. I'm constantly asking myself whether that's
because I have changed or because "the scene" has, but I have decided that
it's not worth it for me to accomodate the scene anymore. At best, I am now
simply an observer 99% of the time. At worst, I don't even care to see.

I guess in short, check it out... but don't expect Disneyland.

What happened with this?  We drove from Willoughby out to Kent, and the
Robin Hood was all locked up.  :-(

We went to Ray's Place instead.  The Zeppelin on the jukebox was no
substitute for your DJ's, but the beer was good.

Wow, this really hit it on the head.  I dont know whether i'm uninterested
in RAVES or that I'm just down with sitting back and letting other people
tell me how they think it is.  All I know is that I sit around enjoying the
music and wishing that something good would come near me, but I'm really
seriously considering going out to find it for myself.... starting sunday
probably, when one of my fav DJ's is here in town, Feelgood.  DEMF was an
option till I realized that I had to DJ Friday night, and I dont feel like
driving to Detroit alone, so it looks like sunday night I will be enjoying
Clockwork at Red Zone.

The only Buzz in the scene that I really have had the pleasure to comment
about is what Control the Night is doing in Akron.  Other than that, I
havent heard of anything on the RAVE tip of things.

Hello,

I stopped going to parties in 2000 i think...well I saw Hawtin in 2001
maybe but aside from that... My friends stopped going and the stuff just
kind of fell apart.

I really miss the scene though, and wondered if it's still like it used
to be, or better? That's my main reason for signing up to this list
again.. Hopefully I can stick around.

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP and Your Latest Tracks

Hey Folks, 

I'm running a Traktor Workshop @ megagrooves (www.megagrooves.com) in
Bloomington Indiana 6/6 (3.5 hrs from Columbus, a haul from Pittsburgh
or Cleveland). 

There's going to be some free NI stuff, hats, shirts, cd's, etc., but I
also wanted to toss the offer out for me to include any of y'alls tracks
on the workshop CD. If you want to get a lil promotion outside of the
Pb-Cle area, just email me the details of where I can grab your stuff. 

- Mike

no offense to you josh cause youre alright, but i hate it when
people who dont know a genre of music try to book it. if you have
to ask, you really shouldnt bother. even the twins finally are
booking decent jungle, but it took them years to get past
dieselboy into more interesting territory.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dom and Roland / Kosheen - and who else do you want to seein PGH??

tom,

you are so rude, and out of it...

tim and ted have been booking good jungle djs for years. damian is one 
of those djs. you know how many times they got burned by bringing in a 
dj who is world class caliber and highly skilled, and yet no one showed 
up?

they bring people like dieselboy and any other person i am sure you 
could find to bitch about because THOSE DJS BRING PEOPLE. it is a very 
simple equation. they need to make enough money to bring in new talent. 
in order to do so, they need people to show up. when they book other 
djs - such as the ones discussed above - many times, people do not show 
up. so in order to do those nights, and expose people to something new, 
they need to bring in djs to establish the night and get people there.

i would think even you would know how it works by now. tim and ted are 
not living in the dark, and they have always known what they were 
doing. they didn't just "figure it out" one day.

but hey, if it makes you feel better, continue to criticize everyone, 
and we can have no events happening at all in this city. then everyone 
can stay home and play their stereos really loud.

yeah, there are plenty of UK deejays they could have been booking
for quite some time now that all would draw plenty of people. is
it because they dont know the genre? quite possibly. i can
remember certain comments i think it was ted made to me about
jungle. and i would make the same comments about crap trance and
prog house. which is why you never saw anyone im associated with
booking it. 

hey, i have less problem with people cashing in if they bring
entertaining people instead of the same old same old.

their events dont matter to me anyway. i dont go out to hear
jungle. i went to see ray keith, i think that was nearly 2 years
ago. they also dont book anything interesting in a million other
genres. i was just pointing out that jungle especially is
something that if you know, you know. if you dont, you probably
shouldnt bother. you lose money. like the twins did.

dj ss, as fucking dope as he might be of a deejay, is still not
really a challenge. he hasnt made an anthem or even a really
standout track in about 6 years. and didnt they book andy c? IMO
about 3 years too late, by the time he came here his sound was
pretty boring and massively played out. 

i gave my suggestions to josh. if he hooks any of them up, THAT
will be something to write home about. id show up for sure.

You're missing the point Tom.  They can't always book who they'd WANT to. 
Dj SS was amazing, I've never seen SO many people dancing per people
there, sadly though, there weren't that many people there.  This doesn't
mean SS isn't an amazing DJ.  I know you're saying that they should be
bringing out the people YOU want to hear, but the point is, no one would
come, and even if they might want to, that's a damn good way to run a
business into the ground, it's a fine balance between booking amazing
talent and people that will draw heads.  The masses in this city don't
seem to know diverse talent, but they do know big names and will come out
and support them, so in order for Tim and Ted to continue doing what
they're doing, they have to book who people will come out for, and not
necessarily the BEST DJs or ones they want to hear.

It all boils down to politics. Which shouldn't be an issue in my book.

It isn't fair for some people, but life isn't fair eh?!

Subject: {pb-cle} Something in the Burgh

Not everyone is looking for bone rattling bass and candykids every weekend. 
This weekend at the Church Brew Works in Bloomfield it looks like there is 
something pretty interesting coming up. I am not involved with this event in 
any way, but think I might like to check it out. If you haven't been to the 
Church, and enjoy a fine handcrafted beer, this is a good opportunity.

http://www.churchbrewworks.com/

International Reggae star "Fyah Wyah" performs beneath the stars at The 
Church Brew Works Saturday, May 24th and Sunday, May 25th for Patio Fest 
2003.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dom and Roland / Kosheen - and who else do you want 
     to seein PGH??

i have very limited comments since your post was quite pointless.

tim and ted are far from "cashing in" as you put it. they put together a
night that brings in a lot of talent. some has been here before, some
hasn't. perhaps they aren't bringing in your "uk" djs, since those djs
really don't have the draw you anticipate, and it is far too expensive
when the money is coming out of your own pocket to take that risk.

i have said this before a million times... tim and ted both work other
jobs. groove does not pay their bills. they in fact end up spending money
out of their own pockets often to have a night go on in this city.

you wanna take a crack at that? go right ahead. but i would ask you first,
when's the last time you did something?

one other thing - i wasn't talking about just tim and ted, i was talking
about the fact that everything that comes out of your mouth is negative.
if  you knew some of the lineup josh already has booked, i am sure you
would like it. and that's because i know what you like. i am sure you
wouldn't like it all, in fact - probably only a little bit - because you
can't like anything more than that.

if you don't want to come out, that's your call. but as much as you are
"sick of" people trying to book acts they "know nothing" about, i am sick
of hearing you make negative comments directed towards people who are
actually attempting to do something, not only because they still happen to
like this music, but because they want others to have the chance to hear
it as well.

say something positive for once... i dare you. i really wonder if it is
possible?

>>innit reggae all about bone rattling bass??

I am not sure Nick, but you might be confusing Raggae with Ragga. Raggae is
more traditional and was originated on acoustic instruments, gourds, steel 
drums, xylophones, etc. Ragga (I think) was an electronic format that found 
its roots in Raggae.

Whether I am right or wrong about the Ragga, think of pretty much any Bob 
Marley or Peter Tosh song you can. They have a mellow, folky flavor to them. 
I am sure you can find some crushing bass at a festival, but the music 
easily can be transferred into a calm "chamber" style format.

Especially on the deck at Church. I envision a nice heady buzz courtesy of 
my burb-yoo-later and a tasty Irish Stout in my hand with a sweet, chill 
groove in the air.

Sorry for posting this to the whole list, I just figured others might be 
thinking the same thing.

SATURDAY JUNE 7th, 2003:

FARID
(Eighteenth Street Lounge, DC)

"Farid Ali is the best DJ in the world," says Eric Hilton of Thievery Corporation. "His feel for and knowledge of music, his taste, timing, and mixing ability are all uncanny." 

Of course, Farid and Eric have been good friends for over ten years but his claims are still quite valid. Farid has been the head resident at ESL since the club opened in 1995 and he's been creating amazing sonic soundscapes ever since. Now Farid has begun to spend some time at ESL Studios and the result has been two excellent 12" records entitled Crowd Control and Dealer's Choice. 

Farid is also an accomplished house dj and is directly responsible for the success of ESL - affiliated club, Red, located just around the corner from the Lounge. With friends 95 North, Deep Dish, Tony Humphries, Basement Boys, DJ Aou, and Sam "The Man" Burns, Farid has created a vibrant scene for high quality, underground house music.

thats not what im saying at all actually. what i want to hear is
shit thats not horribly played out and beaten into the ground by
the time it gets here. do you know why no one appreicates music
like that here? because no one books it, and thus it gets little
to no exposure, so why would people come out to hear something
they NEVER have heard before in their lives? its all the faults of
the promoters booking the same old same old jungle music.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dom and Roland / Kosheen - and who else do you want toseein PGH??

But see, therein lies the catch 22...

If you book "new artists", people don't come because it's something they never heard before.

If you book "the same old shit", people may come, but you aren't breaking new ground.

You can't expect Tim & Ted to run a night into the ground to the point where they can't afford it
anymore just for the sake of being "new". They have cultivated a quality night in
Pittsburgh....quite possibly the only one on that scale that has lasted more than 6 months...they
have done their part and done it well.

It's time for someone to do something new on that scale. Groove has been bringing world-class talent
for 3 years now...so they're doing something right. Why can't anyone else pick up where these guys
have taken it??

Dom and Roland (actually it's just one person) is not really that 
great of a DJ, although he would be a better choice than aphrodite 
anyday.  Kosheen would be interesting even thought they're not my 
favorite, but to bring a live show like that would be quite an 
endeavour (both logisticly and monetarily).

if you are gonna make drum and bass dont forget the BASS...for god sakes its
part of the name of the genre...i have yet to hear any mathmatics, insiders,
calibre, or MIST that really hits(excecpt for a few choice rmx's that
already had slamming bass)...its great they are using all kinds of crazy
instrument samples...but if you are forgetting the chest rattling bass you
are missing the point of the genre.

actually, no.  you're wrong.  there is far more psytrance being released on 
cd-only than on vinyl.  and trust me, i am an encyclopedia of all things 
goa/psytrance.  and if you question where my heart is, then why have i been losing 
money for four years throwing psytrance parties?  plus, if you buy an album on 
vinyl you usually get at least four songs less than the cd version.  yes, you 
can still find a lot of psytrance on vinyl and there are some tracks being 
released only on vinyl, but anymore that's the exception.  and with the equipment 
today you can mix just as well or better with cd's.  and before we get into 
that argument again, there are vinyl dj's who can't mix just as there are cd 
dj's who can't mix.  it's the dj (and of course the music), not the medium....

Then they might be better classified as another sub-genre.  After all, I
got into electronic music because of jungle.  Jungle is not drum & bass,
but it still falls into the same category in respect to evolution.

that argument again, there are vinyl dj's who can't mix just as there are cd 
dj's who can't mix. it's the dj (and of course the music), not the medium.... 

I couldnt agree more about tha quality and "mixability" for CDs... you can definetely do it... but I just like vinyl... theres something about it, and more-so with electronica than even hip-hop than hip-hop even... I dunno, like that other guy said, vinyl has a soul.

i have to say, it's easy to bitch about who promoters
do or don't bring when you're not taking the loss.
everyone bitches but no one wants to do their own
events. i'm just glad there are people doping events
at all, cuz i know i'm not up to it.

Chris, You always come out with an overzealous, off the wall comment as 
"matter of fact." People push you to almost the extreme opposite of what you 
originally said, and you keep saying "that's what I meant" every step of the 
way.

You went from (I'm paraphrasing) "fuck everyone involved with g-spot because 
they don't know shit about music and their not even DJs since they use CDs" 
to "CD is just as cool as vinyl but its just my opinion that vinyl has this 
special soul, maaaaan. That's what I've been saying all along dudes."

Your mind can be changed, but don't think its not obvious that you do this. 
Its a trait that can be described as extremely wishy washy. Have a little 
conviction. I work with a lot of people like you in the corporate 
environment. You'll make a good mid level manager of some crappy corporation 
eventually.

Zap Mama rocks. All women, each from different countries. Each influencing 
the music with lyrics and musical style from their native land. Good call 
Aaron. I'd like to see them too.

I wasnt able to trainspot this at the red zone, due to the God, er DJ =
booth configuration, but the lyrics included "sniff that shit, drink =
that shit, funk that shit, rock that shit, slam that shit, drop that =
shit, feel that shit, groove that shit"  Any help is appreciated...

also if anyone knows what the remake of black sabbath paranoid into a =
house mix is called, i'd appreciate it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Track ID?

:-)

This is a classic example of how the music industry is SUPPOSED to work.
That was a gift from me to Mr. Chaos.  I had the promo, played it a few
times, and realized that I wouldn't be able to give it the exposure it
deserved.  I thought to myself, which on of my customers is gonna make this
track an anthem and give it the exposure it deserved... and Corey came to
mind instantly.  Now here you are asking about it.. classic!

It is called FUNK THAT by COSMO on SOUND RITUAL but it will not be comming
out :(

The best part is the monotone voice in the middle part of the track sorta
singing "you gotta move it, feel it, funk it, house it".

SOUND RITUAL is a label owned by George Morel, along with GROOVE ON.  It is
*THE* most underrated amercian label I know of.  Every time I play a record
off one of those labels it gets a great dancefloor response and no one is
making a big deal about them.  But anyways... Sammy O works for GROOVE
ON/SOUND RITUAL and he says they aren't going to put out the track because
it will be a hit that does not convey the direction they want to take the
label - meaning they don't want to be known for that sound.  They are going
to try to shop it around to another label, possibly IHR, where it really
belongs.   Cosmo asked Southside (Sammy O, Edgar V, and someone else) to do
a remix of it and they turned it down, but are reconsidering it.  If this
track does end up coming out, it will be a good example of how the music
industry is really supposed to work.  BTW... it is COSMO not COSMOS (Tom
Middleton)

The answer to your question about PARANOID is that it was a widely available
white label, not sure if it still is.  I can check if you want me to.  Did
you hear Kevy Kev play it @ Altered States?  Was talking to Feelgood last
night, I'm guessing he has a mix of Safety Dance that is out along with his
bootleg of Duran Duran.

What did you think of the Mashups that Donald Glaude was spinning?
BootyShaker2 - Felix Da Housecat/White lines, and the 50 Cent bootleg, as
well as the La La land thing (that might have ben something he was doing).?

I was having a great time down there last night, and just as I was
questioning the over use of Mashups (an ongoind debate with many djs), I got
to catch the tail end of Mea.   DAMN, I have never heard her before....
definately dope.  Has she always used breaks in her set?

So since this turning into a mini-review of Clockwork... I guess I'll finish
with that.

We got there are 10:10 - my main purpose was to check out the Ascenion_am
leaders Mark Mayhem & Kid Chaos put on the Mayhem & Chaos show :)  We said
our hellos to everyone and found a spot at the bar where I consumed 8
Bacardi O3's and did not even get buzzed... love that sutff :)  Mayhem &
Chaos tore it up, David Alvarado had to follow that "funk that" track, so he
pretty much brought the room down and started fresh.  David was definately a
good dj and I hope to see him in Cleveland this fall or summer.  We checked
out Ra-Shawn and the breakdance things in the back room for a hot minute.
We got a few minutes of Titonton up in the standard lounge, but I got drug
back into the main room.   Then Mea, follwed by Nigel.

All I gotta say about the night is once again PROPS to Doughboy and the rest
of PCP for brining in quality entertainment to Ohio all in one show.  To see
a show of this magnatude in a club of this size just amazes me.  THANK YOU
for keeping it real.

I wasnt able to trainspot this at the red zone, due to the God, er DJ booth
configuration, but the lyrics included "sniff that shit, drink that shit,
funk that shit, rock that shit, slam that shit, drop that shit, feel that
shit, groove that shit"  Any help is appreciated...

also if anyone knows what the remake of black sabbath paranoid into a house
mix is called, i'd appreciate it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Track ID?

DAMMIT Doug, i want a copy of that track.  Steal it back. (Or go old school
and become an "Indian giver")

I actually had totally forgot how bad the 50 cent bootleg completely blew
the roof off when glaude was spinning.  Welcome to columbus.  lol.  I was
watching from the VIP balcony when he was doing the la la land thing,
semi-trainspotting if you will, and he was doing that himself, i completely
dug his set, it made me completely smile ear to ear at several spots just
because it was FUN just to WATCH him work.

I too caught part of Mea's set, mainly cause i found alvarado to be boring,
which is just my opinion cause all the mixing i heard was on spot, but hell,
like you said, it's hard to follow that track, esp when i was asking for it
as the one thing i wanted from this night.

This is Rep from Bassmintmusic. Back in 1999-2000 Someone dropped off a demo 
and introduced Bassmintmusic to Etain.  Bassmint Music was the first to 
bring Etain to Columbus and she spun at
Mekka, The Alley and other venues.

Bassmint Music was also the first to bring Sammy O from South Beach to Ohio 
on many occassions
and people are just discovering him and his production talent up in 
Cleveland.

If you want some new talent there is DJ ALENA (DNB) lives in Columbus but 
originally from LATIVA
and KONVERSION (DNB) from VA. There is also Freddy Bastone (Bastone&Burnz) 
and Mark Kamins
two lengendary DJs from back in the day (Timmy Regisford and Larry Levan 
days) from New York
that would surely slam.

There's a several new names and talented dj's to think about. If you have to 
take risk to be the
best or good at what you do, yeah you may fall on your face a few times but 
the payoff is greater.
Gotta take risk.

  Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Track ID?


  :-)

  This is a classic example of how the music industry is SUPPOSED to =
work.
  That was a gift from me to Mr. Chaos.  I had the promo, played it a =
few
  times, and realized that I wouldn't be able to give it the exposure it
  deserved.  I thought to myself, which on of my customers is gonna make =
this
  track an anthem and give it the exposure it deserved... and Corey came =
to
  mind instantly.  Now here you are asking about it.. classic!

  It is called FUNK THAT by COSMO on SOUND RITUAL but it will not be =
comming
  out :(

  The best part is the monotone voice in the middle part of the track =
sorta
  singing "you gotta move it, feel it, funk it, house it".

  SOUND RITUAL is a label owned by George Morel, along with GROOVE ON.  =
It is
  *THE* most underrated amercian label I know of.  Every time I play a =
record
  off one of those labels it gets a great dancefloor response and no one =
is
  making a big deal about them.  But anyways... Sammy O works for GROOVE
  ON/SOUND RITUAL and he says they aren't going to put out the track =
because
  it will be a hit that does not convey the direction they want to take =
the
  label - meaning they don't want to be known for that sound.  They are =
going
  to try to shop it around to another label, possibly IHR, where it =
really
  belongs.   Cosmo asked Southside (Sammy O, Edgar V, and someone else) =
to do
  a remix of it and they turned it down, but are reconsidering it.  If =
this
  track does end up coming out, it will be a good example of how the =
music
  industry is really supposed to work.  BTW... it is COSMO not COSMOS =
(Tom
  Middleton)

  The answer to your question about PARANOID is that it was a widely =
available
  white label, not sure if it still is.  I can check if you want me to.  =
Did
  you hear Kevy Kev play it @ Altered States?  Was talking to Feelgood =
last
  night, I'm guessing he has a mix of Safety Dance that is out along =
with his
  bootleg of Duran Duran.

  What did you think of the Mashups that Donald Glaude was spinning?
  BootyShaker2 - Felix Da Housecat/White lines, and the 50 Cent bootleg, =
as
  well as the La La land thing (that might have ben something he was =
doing).?

  I was having a great time down there last night, and just as I was
  questioning the over use of Mashups (an ongoind debate with many djs), =
I got
  to catch the tail end of Mea.   DAMN, I have never heard her =
before....
  definately dope.  Has she always used breaks in her set?

  So since this turning into a mini-review of Clockwork... I guess I'll =
finish
  with that.

  We got there are 10:10 - my main purpose was to check out the =
Ascenion_am
  leaders Mark Mayhem & Kid Chaos put on the Mayhem & Chaos show :)  We =
said
  our hellos to everyone and found a spot at the bar where I consumed 8
  Bacardi O3's and did not even get buzzed... love that sutff :)  Mayhem =
&
  Chaos tore it up, David Alvarado had to follow that "funk that" track, =
so he
  pretty much brought the room down and started fresh.  David was =
definately a
  good dj and I hope to see him in Cleveland this fall or summer.  We =
checked
  out Ra-Shawn and the breakdance things in the back room for a hot =
minute.
  We got a few minutes of Titonton up in the standard lounge, but I got =
drug
  back into the main room.   Then Mea, follwed by Nigel.

  All I gotta say about the night is once again PROPS to Doughboy and =
the rest
  of PCP for brining in quality entertainment to Ohio all in one show.  =
To see
  a show of this magnatude in a club of this size just amazes me.  THANK =
YOU
  for keeping it real.

Subject: {pb-cle} DJs get waxed (was: help!!!)

ok lets talk goa, wax and the making of good music in general.  yes much music is only released on cd, agreed!  but that certainly doesn't make it good music.  i see it this way, if the artist or label is going to take the time to release something on wax, they apparently think its got enuff clout to be played by djs.  and this doesn't mean a thing in the land of a thousand djs.  I'm a dj, your a dj, hey even my mom 
djs.   I went to a rave last night, a pretty big one i might add, in three warehouses and one outdoor stage.  
it was called magical maydays in miami fl. lets review...   
a great party, maybe 1-2k in attendance,  mediocre lighting, sound was pretty good.  lets talk music.  it sucked (talking techno, not including the hip-hop or DnB which were pretty good).  not one dj, not two dj but most of the djs were spinning lack luster tracks.  and yes most were spinning wax.  saw Christopher Lawrence spin the best set there and he was using a combo wax/cd.  so apparently there is and always has been an overflow of artists/djs who release/play bogus material.  like ok lets pick up Reason and make a couple of tracks, well even start our own label!
this attitude is flooding the shops and djs & wannabes with nothing more than piss poor records.  hell even the pros do it!  I'm wondering if these guys have a sense of style or taste or do they spin what their label tells um?  it was pure crap and has given me inspiration to produce and release my own material that has had a good going over.  
which leaves me to say this. no matter what your spinning (wax or cd) take the time to find quality productions to mix into your set because god damn no one else is.  i must be getting too old or the music is getting REALLY bad.  what gives?
these are simply observations made by myself over a number of years and are not meant to discourage anyone but to hopefully improve the quality of music being played and released.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJs get waxed (was: help!!!)

Just my .02..I don't really care if the dj spins on 
cd's or wax as long as he/she doesn't suck. It is 
all about the sound comming out of the speaks. 

I'm going to use Atomic record as an example, who 
imho is putting out the phattest shit ever. I have
most of their wax collection, but they have more
available on cd which is top notch music. Dj's would do
well to put that in their arsenal. The bottom line
is there is just more music available on cd and there
is nothing wrong with cd's. I still love the vinyl and
you can't beat the unique style of vinyl (notice I 
didn't say superior sound). I still spin mostly vinyl,
but most definitley will not rule out mixing in cd's
in the future. I love having the option to use both. 

The sidetrakkt crew droped some of the dopest all cd mixes I 
have ever heard. I became a true believer at their last
event. 

Peace,

>>>>>>>>>How were the other parties?

the Saturday Night Unity Party was pretty tight.  Got there in time to see 
Agoria, Gene Ferris, Kenny Larkin.  I got to meet Derrick May also.  No 
booze though - just a warehouse party with tons of strobes.  Four corners of 
sound with the DJs in the middle fo the room.

and of course the Sunday Night Naked Music Party was awesome - geat place, 
great music and great vibe - Miguel Migs was flawless - Lisa Shaw really got 
into it and sang her heart out.  I never stopped moving. Everything you 
could expect from a Naked Music Party.  Only bad part about it is that it 
ended at 2:30am.

The rest of the festival was very great also.

Too bad the Pontchartrain Hotel crumbled over the weeked ... just fell apart 
- and I know that part of this was do to all the Pittsburgh people staying 
there.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} DJs get waxed (was: help!!!)

I tend to agree with ya there Luke...

(Theoretically) with programs Traktor FS, the distinction between Mp3's,
CD's, and wax does not exist. 

I'm going to throw aside the digital delivery medium discussion aside
for a moment...

If there's one thing I've noticed it's that the quality on a lot of the
imported vinyl I have is just awful. My ab fab track a.t.m. (Swept Away
/ Protected) is on really hideous czech wax -- the only thing the
actually worse than the feel, weight, and quality of the record is the
mastering and replication work that went into it. It could totally pass
for a glitch record. Now, you can get mastering + plating done at
metropolis for < $300 USD (TOTALLY worth the cost), replication on 140
gram virgin vinyl @ united for ~ $400 (500ct), and really get a wicked
sounding white label done up for ~ $800 in the end. 

Now let's do some math. Yay math!

$800 / 500 = $1.60 a piece total cost.

150 promo copies to labels and artists
Guerilla 5 a piece to distributors and record stores (x 20) = another
100 copies out the door.

Ok, now you're officially in the hole and you have to sell the remaining
lot at $3.20 a piece to break even. If you're a label, and you have
distribution, a lot of these costs can even be comped by your
distributor.

Now, with the idea in mind that something must be good in the first
place for someone to spend the time getting it pressed, etc., you'd
THINK that someone would spend the time researching the best way to get
it done, not the cheapest -- which I just find confusing given the
amount of good tracks on crap wax that I have. Why half-ass it?

As a side note, troll your respective genre portals for tracks by folks
who aren't nessicarily music industry professionals. I've found,
especially in the genre of dnb, that these tracks are far superior these
days to someone who's established and putting out wax for the sake of...
I dunno... or your average juno.co.uk wax. And still more interesting
than tradional labels putting out CD's or MP3 releases is the fact that
you can bypass the entire machine.

Just my .02..I don't really care if the dj spins on 
cd's or wax as long as he/she doesn't suck. It is 
all about the sound comming out of the speaks. 

I'm going to use Atomic record as an example, who 
imho is putting out the phattest shit ever. I have
most of their wax collection, but they have more
available on cd which is top notch music. Dj's would do
well to put that in their arsenal. The bottom line
is there is just more music available on cd and there
is nothing wrong with cd's. I still love the vinyl and
you can't beat the unique style of vinyl (notice I 
didn't say superior sound). I still spin mostly vinyl,
but most definitley will not rule out mixing in cd's
in the future. I love having the option to use both. 

The sidetrakkt crew droped some of the dopest all cd mixes I 
have ever heard. I became a true believer at their last
event. 

Peace,

Probably because "good" is such a subjective term.

I've done tracks that I think are "good" that you probably wouldn't touch.
You could probably make some tracks that are "good" that I wouldn't play...

There are definites in the "good" track/"bad" track argument, yes, but there's a pretty big "gray
area" as well, based on the individual taste/style of the person buying/playing/producing the music.


<<As a side note, troll your respective genre portals for tracks by folks who aren't nessicarily
music industry professionals. I've found, especially in the genre of dnb, that these tracks are far
superior these days to someone who's established and putting out wax for the sake of... I dunno...
or your average juno.co.uk wax. And still more interesting than tradional labels putting out CD's or
MP3 releases is the fact that you can bypass the entire machine. >>

And there are also a lot of tracks in there that have good ideas, but not necessarily the execution
to take the track all the way into the "good" area...

Which is why a little bit of knowhow, some software, and of course the blessing of the original
artist can help you unearth a gem, polish it, and turn it into some damn fine jewelry.

oh right on!

I was implying that this was not a club - pure warehouse space out in the 
middle of nowhere - security was tight and professional though.  Guys in 
suits escorting you right in.  No liquor sold except in the VIP room 
upstairs in a special loft.  You had to pay extra to go up there.  I was 
invited up once I met Derrick but was on my way out so I declined the 
invite.  Don't know what it was like up there.

  I was tempted to go to the Naked party at 3am but I wasn't sure where it was or what time it ended.  Now I wish I would of headed to the Naked party earlier.  There was just to much stuff going on.  It was difficult enough trying to get jungle DJ's and house heads to agree on one party to go to!

>>>>>>>>>How were the other parties?

the Saturday Night Unity Party was pretty tight.  Got there in time to see 
Agoria, Gene Ferris, Kenny Larkin.  I got to meet Derrick May also.  No 
booze though - just a warehouse party with tons of strobes.  Four corners of 
sound with the DJs in the middle fo the room.

and of course the Sunday Night Naked Music Party was awesome - geat place, 
great music and great vibe - Miguel Migs was flawless - Lisa Shaw really got 
into it and sang her heart out.  I never stopped moving. Everything you 
could expect from a Naked Music Party.  Only bad part about it is that it 
ended at 2:30am.

The rest of the festival was very great also.

Too bad the Pontchartrain Hotel crumbled over the weeked ... just fell apart 
- and I know that part of this was do to all the Pittsburgh people staying 
there.

Did he share his thoughts on the festival? The turnout? How he thought it went? I would be very interested in hearing that. It seemed to me there wasn't as big an all around turnout as previous years but Sunday night really packed up. Anyone catch Jeff Mill's set? How was it? I was so mad about not being to catch many Monday night sets but I had to head home..
 
I was really digging a lot of the smaller vending booths that had systems this year and the Institute tent near the grassy knoll. We really lucked out with the weather this year! Finally went to an afterparty Sunday night - the one with Phantom 45 and Justin Long - awesome vibe except the the venue was like 200 degrees and they ran out of water..
 
Not too sure about the Pontchartrain.. Wasn't too happy to wake up Sunday and hear the 18 floor had been evacuated because of a fire.. Anyone stay at the RenCen? I hear they were really strict this year..

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Post-Movement

yeah - this is probably my last year at the Pontchartrain - have stayed 
there every year so far but this year was by far the worst.  There were 
something like 35 arrests on Saturday Night - two elevators were shut down - 
Rumored that kids went up throught the ceiling and were riding on top of the 
elevators.  The place was TRASHED.  I mean, it's cool to party and all but 
give some respect and don't tag the elevators and don't leave beer cans and 
bottles in the hallways and lobby.  Too many cracked out kids.

As far as the staff - housekeeping was still pretty sweet.  But the 
management was tough.
All my rooms were switched around and I did not get what I reserved.  I 
reserved 4 rooms with 2 dbl beds in each.  When I got there each room only 
had 1 bed and each room only got one key.  Not impressed with their 'there 
is nothing we can do about it' attitude.

As far as me meeting D. May - it was not a sit down 'how ya feeling?' kind 
of thing.  I was standing behind the stage watching Kenny Larkin and Kevin 
Saudserson talking during Gene Ferris' set and Derrick May just walked up to 
them out of no where.  No one seemed to notice.  I then watched May walk 
over to a guy from URB magazine and they were looking at an issue with May 
on the cover.  People didn't seem to know who he was cause everone was still 
bumping into him and casually pushing him aside.  He was sort of laughing 
about it so he held the magazine up to his face to sort of say 'don't you 
know who I am?' - he saw that I caught what he did so I just stuck out my 
hand and introduced myself and told him thanks for keeping things together 
this year.  It was cool - shake hands - pat on the back sort of thing.  He 
walked away and that's when this guy came up to me and invited me up to the 
VIP room.  I think though they were just not getting poeple to pay extra for 
VIP so they were giving the passes out to everyone at that point.

speedy j was ok, i didnt want to hear such a bangin'
set, but whatever..it was good and it made total sense
@ an event like that.
stewart walker however, rocked it as usual. the timing
of that whole event sucked, i have heard several
different rumours as to why it was shut down, who
knows. vladislav delay/luomo was rockin as well.

the best party i went to was the interdimensional
transmissions party on sunday night [cannonball]
i havent danced so much in one night in years. the
hotness.

jeff mills was a bit of adissapointment, but
whatever..missed all of monday [aside from mills] as a
result of a slight "detour" but carl craig & the
detroit experiment were another highlight, dabrye was
hot, ectomorph, ayro, lots of goodness.

good times. good times.

yeah - this is probably my last year at the Pontchartrain - have stayed
there every year so far but this year was by far the worst.  There were
something like 35 arrests on Saturday Night - two elevators were shut down -
Rumored that kids went up throught the ceiling and were riding on top of the
elevators.  The place was TRASHED.  I mean, it's cool to party and all but
give some respect and don't tag the elevators and don't leave beer cans and
bottles in the hallways and lobby.  Too many cracked out kids.

As far as the staff - housekeeping was still pretty sweet.  But the
management was tough.
All my rooms were switched around and I did not get what I reserved.  I
reserved 4 rooms with 2 dbl beds in each.  When I got there each room only
had 1 bed and each room only got one key.  Not impressed with their 'there
is nothing we can do about it' attitude.

As far as me meeting D. May - it was not a sit down 'how ya feeling?' kind
of thing.  I was standing behind the stage watching Kenny Larkin and Kevin
Saudserson talking during Gene Ferris' set and Derrick May just walked up to
them out of no where.  No one seemed to notice.  I then watched May walk
over to a guy from URB magazine and they were looking at an issue with May
on the cover.  People didn't seem to know who he was cause everone was still
bumping into him and casually pushing him aside.  He was sort of laughing
about it so he held the magazine up to his face to sort of say 'don't you
know who I am?' - he saw that I caught what he did so I just stuck out my
hand and introduced myself and told him thanks for keeping things together
this year.  It was cool - shake hands - pat on the back sort of thing.  He
walked away and that's when this guy came up to me and invited me up to the
VIP room.  I think though they were just not getting poeple to pay extra for
VIP so they were giving the passes out to everyone at that point.

At least I got to give me respect to the man in charge.

what are you talking about? i was pointing out that funkstorung is
a band that would not draw any crowd in pgh because no one books
any IDM outside of manny theiner's weak nights thus they have
nearly no audience here. id love to go see them play in pgh. 

why did everyone lose their ability to comprehend the english
language when they read that email? i reread it, and it makes
perfect sense.

Subject: {pb-cle} detroit review

i edited this down from a large review to make it strictly music
relevant. this was my first time in detroit, and it was fantastic.

friday night: todd sines and aril brikha preparty

we arrived at the pub just in time to miss
todd sines' set. big fun. finally aril brikha
came on, and he killed it. he played mostly new tracks along with
a couple favorites from the "deeparture in time" LP. when he was
done, i thanked him for being the man and we jetted to go get some
sleep. 

saturday: the festival

we rolled over to the main stage
for double helix's set, which ended up being quite nice and
smooth. the first part of ayro's live set involved him making a
rather complex
funky drum beat and synth line just using an mpc and a couple
keyboards. he freestyled a couple tracks worth of really nice
jazzy broken beat before bringing out his vocalist/girlfriend to
perform tracks from his forthcoming album. the songs sounded nice,
but lacked the spontanaety of the awesome first part, which was
without question the most impressive live PA ive ever seen. the
reese project played next, and they rocked out some generally deep
sounding house music with vocals, though they seemed to be having
some problems. buzz goree comes on and crushes some awesome detroit
techno. following him was rolando, who absolutely tore it up. he
played tons of classic techno tracks like "strings of life" and
"night drive". we had to leave his set early though so we could
wander over to the high tech soul stage for amp fiddler's live
set. he played with a full band and just rocked
out on a nord lead 2 and a nord electro which makes all the
rhodes/organ/electromechanical keyboard sounds that a funk player
would need. the experience he had playing with people like prince
and p-funk showed up in his stage show and his dress which
included an afro, 70's style wraparound shades, and an african
outfit. he danced around and sang and played keys on a bunch of
tracks that i recognized like "eye to eye" and "superficial" from
his basementality EP as well as some parliament covers. the
highlight was without a doubt his performance of "im doing fine"
which he recorded with kenny dixon jr as amp dog knight for the
first mahogani record. after that fantastic set we rolled over
to the music institute stage for some ron trent, who was
absolutely killing it with some deep ass disco and house music.

saturday night: rob hood and suburban knight afterparty

suburban knight was rocking the final scratch,
playing chill melodic detroit techno tunes that should have been
played at 33 pitched up at 45. it sounded really odd, especially
when he played tunes i knew like some aril brikha and more
strings of life. at first i didnt like it, but after a while i
actually got pretty into it. he started mixing in some jungle
sounding stuff with the sped up and techno and that really had a
dope effect. after him was some guy i dont know also playing off
final scratch. he dropped some laurent garnier as well as some
other deep detroit tunes played at their proper speed. rob hood
started off banging it out with some really quick hard techno. im
not the biggest fan of the
harder styles, but ive always liked his hard mixes as well as his
harder productions so i was really looking forward to an ill set
from him. 35 minutes into his set, just as everyone was starting
to get into it, he pulled off his record and quickly packed his
shit up. someone got on the mic and said "the police will be
arriving very shortly, we advise everyone to leave the building
immediately." everyone got out so we did too, running into a very
irritated looking rob hood on our way out. 

sunday: more festival

we made it down to the high tech
soul stage before dabrye's set to find all the rest of our crew
already chilling waiting for his live set. what appeared to be an
old ass computer sat alongside an old synth and a sampled for what
ended up being a very awesome live PA. lots of fat hiphop-esque
beats with nice atmosphere and huge raw basslines. dwele came on
after dabrye and
he and his band played a really nice set of slow soul music. he
was a really nice guy who was very happy to be playing, and it
showed. their sampler had some glitches so they just turned it off
and got funky. the music went very well with the warm sunny day.
at 4 we went over to the main stage to catch john beltran's live
set. it was very nice chilled out melodic stuff featuring ayro and
john arnold on keys and guitar as well as a percussionist.
around 5 we went over to the
high tech soul stage to get in position for the detroit experiment
set at 6. we caught the last half of vikter duplaix's deejay set.
he was rocking the classic tunes like chaka khan's "aint nobody"
and africanism's "block party" and of course the ubiquitous
"strings of life". once he was done, the detroit experiment set
up. i turned around to look up at the huge wall of people that had
assembled to
witness this once in a lifetime performance of funk techno and
soul musicians next to old jazz heads. it was an intense feeling,
and their set was every bit as intense. they played for around an
hour, and it was without question the best music ive ever heard
live. amp fiddler held down the keys while carl craig rocked the
spacey scifi synth parts. the jazz guys i didnt know, though the
old horn players were absolutely awesome. the drummer played with
herbie hancock's headhunters squad and the percussionist played
with sun ra back in the day. for the last song the athletic mic
league came out to rap over a track, and it was really good too,
featuring a white female emcee who just crushed it. we listened to
some of pole's set,
which was really boring. we went over to the music institue stage
to catch
the second half of agent x's set. he was rocking the nice smooth
detroit house. at 9 the 3 chairs came on. obviously my
hopes were quite high, and they followed through with the best
deejay set ive ever heard. theo started off playing just the best
disco and vocal house tunes, really top notch deep stuff. he
rocked the EQs like no deejay ive ever seen, and he was feeling
it, dancing around and singing along with the tracks. marcellus
pitman and rick wilhite rocked it as well, keeping the sounds
smooth as hell. then kenny dixon came on, with a bucket hat
pulled down really low and a ski mask on so you could only see
just part of his face around his eyes. then the lights went out
plunging the tent into darkness. kenny played some stuff that was
deep and slow and a little more techno oriented before playing
some more housey stuff. it was just off the chain. the crowds
reactions to these guys was perfect. hundreds and hundreds of
people going wild for the best music. lots of dancing, yelling,
chanting, clapping, etc. every stupid sappy tale youve heard about
how great house music is was true for 3 hours. about 50 people
were doing the electric slide which bradford thankfully caught on
digital video.

monday: even more festival

we hit the
underground stage early for midwest product's set. they rocked it,
mixing rock and electronics into a weird combo that was totally
awesome. they had a singer come on for their last 2 songs, both
prince covers including "when doves cry" which was just the bomb.
we headed over to the music institute tent after that for shake's
set. he crushed shit, dropping the craziest tracks. the crowd
response to shawn's "live alone" track off the new technoir 002
was awesome. shake probably has the best most varied selection of
any deejay ive ever seen and his mixing was solid. we caught
time:space at 5. time:space is aril brikha, ayro, and a bass
player and a percussionist. it was awesome as well, very laid back
stuff, mostly tunes from aril brikha's LP including their finale
of "otill" my favorite track from my favorite album. ayro was
rocking the fender rhodes over it, and incorporated the main
melodies from "the bells" by jeff mills and "cars" by gary neuman
into the song. it was dope. we went over to the music institute
stage for juan atkins' set at 6. it was pretty awful, there was
some technical difficulty at the beginning which meant that the
highs were too loud and there was almost no bass. juan's mixing
wasnt at its best so we rolled out to go hear norma jean bell's
set on the main stage at 7. we laid down on
the concrete seats to get some rest in anticipation of jeff mills'
set later that night. norma jean bell played some ill deep vocal
house, perfect for resting on a nice detroit evening. gary martin
played some records from 8-10 going from some harder sounding
detroit tunes to a bunch of tunes from
his technotica label. by this time everyone was getting amped for
jeff mills.we decided to go down to
the front for prime speaker space for mills' set. we hung around
for a minute and quite possibly the most entertaining thing of the
weekend happened. i was wearing my throwback 1979 pillbox pirates
hat. this kid said to me "hey, nice hat. are you from pittsburgh?"
i said to him "yeah". then he said to me "hey, do you know shawn
rudiman?" and i said "yeah its this guy right here" as shawn was
standing next to me and was watching the conversation. the guy
didnt believe me, shawn had to show him his driver's license. the
guy proceeded to gush all over shawn like he was the greatest
thing since sliced bread. i was just cracking up. shawn gave him a
copy of the new technoir record and he seemed pretty pleased. then
derrick may
came onstage to introduce jeff mills. the atmosphere at this point
was off the hook entirely. mills started off playing martin luther
king jr's "i have a dream" speech. his first tune: "jaguar".
NOTHING could have killed the feeling at that point. except some
serious technical difficulties. which happened. the mixer was
f*cked up, the bass was sounding all farty and the levels were
low. mills laid low while the sound guys fixed everything, but it
took about 15 minutes during which the excitement level died
considerably. once they got things going alright, mills played
some electro ("planet rock" i can remember hearing" and some
harder techno, though the levels still werent up very high. he
played "the bells" and the reaction due to the weak sound system
was pretty tame. finally a few records later the bass kicked in
and the volume was raised, but at that point it was impossible to
save the original hype that had been built. what followed was a
very nice set, very well rounded with few bad errors and a ton of
really "how the hell did he pull that off?" mixed. he played some
Wizard-ish tracks which he introed with some music from the wizard
of oz. his 909 programming was good the first time he rocked it,
but the second time near the end of his set he just seemed to
crank up the tempo knob which was pretty weak IMO. still his track
selection was on point, lots of old hiphop house and electro jams
kept everyone pretty happy. im only disappointed with his set
because i saw what it could have been: an epiphany. somehow things
just didnt work out that way. it didnt really detract from the
festival though, which was without question the best 3 days of
music ive ever witnessed. after mills' set, derrick may came back
on to hug mills and give a long list of thank yous. i think he did
an excellent job, and im way too excited for next year's festival.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} detroit review

I had a great time in detroit this year....last years was of
course weak. and the sequal never meets expectations of the
original...

this was movement 03... a new generation.....sort of.


I didnt really hit any afterparties because i was:
1. sleeping
2. intoxicated and sleeping
3. poor
4. intoxicated and sleeping.

friday: i hit the record shoppes, i was very disappointed in the
lack of selection. I've hit record time many times over the past
few years, and this was thier absolute lowest point in selction.


saturday:

i was fairly dizzy walking into the festival, but i can say that

1. same ol' vendors...bah! bring back the label tents!
2. food is expensive!
3. how many good looking wimmens can there be in one place?

sunday:

great weather! better music! 3 chairs! theo f'n parrish? if you
didnt see 3 chairs perform, you missed movement 03. the soul of
detroit came out during that set, and the vibe of the people
attending the show...damn. i loved every minute of it...and found
myself asking...when are we going to have events like these here
in pb? (hey..it had tom dancing!)

Victor Duplaix...this guy can get a party started up properly.
whcihc brings me to....

THE DETROIT EXPERIMENT. another part of the festival that if you
missed it....you missed the festival! jazz. fusion. electronics.
class. history. what more can you ask for?


SSSSHAKE! im biased here, as this guy is probably my favorite
DJ/producer. good set, and always great tracks.

midwest product: i didnt know what to expect from these guys...but
THIS WAS QUITE AN ACT! all i know is, i've been reading up on
these guys...i expect big things from them.

ayro: i liked this act, but it did remind me TOO much of
jamiroquai and arrested development...VERY bohemian...but the
music was fucking good.

>would need. the experience he had playing with people like prince
>and p-funk showed up in his stage show and his dress which
>included an afro, 70's style wraparound shades, and an african

>which he recorded with kenny dixon jr as amp dog knight for the

>
>suburban knight was rocking the final scratch,

>when he played tunes i knew like some aril brikha and more
>strings of life. at first i didnt like it, but after a while i
>actually got pretty into it. he started mixing in some jungle
>sounding stuff with the sped up and techno and that really had a
>dope effect. after him was some guy i dont know also playing off
>final scratch. he dropped some laurent garnier as well as some
>other deep detroit tunes played at their proper speed. rob hood
>started off banging it out with some really quick hard techno. im
>not the biggest fan of the
>harder styles, but ive always liked his hard mixes as well as his
>harder productions so i was really looking forward to an ill set
>from him. 35 minutes into his set, just as everyone was starting
>to get into it, he pulled off his record and quickly packed his

>arriving very shortly, we advise everyone to leave the building
>immediately." everyone got out so we did too, running into a very
>irritated looking rob hood on our way out. 
>
>sunday: more festival
>
>we made it down to the high tech
>soul stage before dabrye's set to find all the rest of our crew
>already chilling waiting for his live set. what appeared to be an
>old ass computer sat alongside an old synth and a sampled for what

>after dabrye and
>he and his band played a really nice set of slow soul music. he
>was a really nice guy who was very happy to be playing, and it
>showed. their sampler had some glitches so they just turned it off
>and got funky. the music went very well with the warm sunny day.
>at 4 we went over to the main stage to catch john beltran's live
>set. it was very nice chilled out melodic stuff featuring ayro and
>john arnold on keys and guitar as well as a percussionist.
>around 5 we went over to the
>high tech soul stage to get in position for the detroit experiment
>set at 6. we caught the last half of vikter duplaix's deejay set.
>he was rocking the classic tunes like chaka khan's "aint nobody"
>and africanism's "block party" and of course the ubiquitous

>up. i turned around to look up at the huge wall of people that had

>witness this once in a lifetime performance of funk techno and
>soul musicians next to old jazz heads. it was an intense feeling,
>and their set was every bit as intense. they played for around an

>rocked the EQs like no deejay ive ever seen, and he was feeling

>pulled down really low and a ski mask on so you could only see
>just part of his face around his eyes. then the lights went out
>plunging the tent into darkness. kenny played some stuff that was

>
>monday: even more festival
>
>we hit the

>awesome. they had a singer come on for their last 2 songs, both
>prince covers including "when doves cry" which was just the bomb.
>we headed over to the music institute tent after that for shake's

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} detroit review

gotta say i had a pretty decent time..being the drunkard/bakehead i am not
always sure who i was seeing...didnt catch much of anything friday as we got
down to the festival around 9 to hunt out steph to get our keys to the
hotel...after getting to the hotel...copious amounts of alcohol were
consumed...a goat was sacrficed to the techno gods(the goat by the way was
sold to the gyro/kabaabob stand the next day)...and im sure a whole shitload
of other various interesting things happened, but damn if i can
remember...sunday was nice...great weather...the best thing i heard all
weekend was over at the high tech soul stage...a dj rocking some insland
influenced stuff and a dude on percussion(most of the time 3congas, but he
had some other stuff too)...ive always been a huge fan of island
sounds...little weird to hear a str8 beat instead of a breakbeat(id call it
a 4 to the floor beat but that doesnt really quite describe it)with the
island flavour...but the live percussion really helped get me into
it...after that set the festival seemed uber-crowed...dawn and myself got
tired of fighting the masses so we went back to the telly to chill...we had
notions of after parties...but when drunken jea and drunken ra showed up, we
knew it werent happening...at least i caught chappelles special on
HBO...sunday we went back to the festival to catch jazzy jay and grand
wizard theodore...but i dont think they played...there was a dj playing
hiphop/electro/disco/funk/soul...but he wasnt really mixing...dude had some
good tunes...but he wasnt doing anything with that...after that jes and john
wanted to be out...plus it started raining...

hi-lites of the weekend
-a super dizzy dank dope hotel...way cheaper than the ren. center, much
nicer, and very friendly...id tell you lot which one, but i dont want it
getting destroyed next year and becoming nazified like so many of the hotels
in detroit last weekend(but if you hit my privately ill tell if i know you,
or maybe ill send you to the corner of murder ave and crack blvd in detroit
you never know)
-staying in room 420 at the hotel :)
-meeting the head in 419 :))
-the dj/conga set i caught
-the loud ass renegade system...PROPER

lo-lites
-the crowd sunday nite
-no pizza delivery saturday nite(i guess they were el-slammo)
-the IHOP service
-not buying a bigger bottle of jim beam black
-people coming in after we all passed out...no offense to none of you
lot...just umm...kinda startling  in my state (someplace between weed dreams
and whiskey business)
-forgetting the ghetto blaster...we used an ibook all weekend for tunes in
the telly...nothing rocks like 2cm speakers.


Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

hahaha, so did we.  switched to that when the cartoon network put on ed, 
edd, and eddy or one of those crappy cartoons.  they had some odd "my 
best friend plank" thing about a board.....   we were trying to decide 
whether it was a real cartoon, and if it would have been good.   i mean 
they have one about a milkshake and a meatball thats pretty damn good.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} detroit review

<<switched to that when the cartoon network put on ed, edd, and eddy or one of those crappy
cartoons.>>

it's all about Dexter's Laboratory

<<i mean they have one about a milkshake and a meatball thats pretty damn good.>>

I was watching The Usual Suspects on TNN last night, and apparently they're switching their
"paradigm" even more...they're going to become "SPIKE tv" very soon...sort of like the polar
opposite of Lifetime..."all testosterone, all the time".

They, apparently, have some sort of deal with John Kriscfalusi to do new Ren and Stimpy
cartoons...this time aimed for adults...

I'm pretty geeked to see them, especially considering John K. is back on the job.

Hey Kaleo - as I recall, Brother Mke and I tried calling you at least 12 
diffrent times wanting to meet up with you but you were lame and you never 
came up to our room or whatever.

by the way - that was me who made Mike call you Sunday Morning and pretend 
to order room service.

I never did get my eggs and toast.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} detroit review

There are a TON of format changes coming down the pipe...

TNN will be Spike (as noted), meant to be Lifetime for guys. As long as
they never show "The Other Half" I'm happy.

MuchMusic USA will be FUSE (Or is it Fuze, or has it already happened
already and I have lots of work to do?)

MTV2 is playing more and more non-music crap as they move towards
pushing content out to the dozens of other channels they're offering.

There's a lot more that I'm just not remembering now. I wish they would
put all the kids cartoons on boomerang and it would be Adult Swim 24/7
on Cartoon Network, but it would confuse parents and heaven forbid they
should lose the babysitter.


Here's some weird TV facts:

There's currently more hispanic programming on cable than english
language only. The system where I live (and work) in alone has 13
dedicated spanish language only channels, and SAP spanish audio for most
other channels.

If you were to take the storage for a video on demand system serving
~250k subscribers, convert it to floppies, and stack them... You'd have
a stack that could go to the moon and back 6 times.

At any given time, with a digital cable setup, you have your choice of
over 1500 things to watch when you sit down to your TV. (Yet, they all
seem to be crap)

Cable systems are very large IP networks, your box is pretty much a
sophisticated web browser. 

The average cable sysadmin often works 90+ hours a week, and often
considers frisbee seppuku as an option.

<<switched to that when the cartoon network put on ed, edd, and eddy or
one of those crappy cartoons.>>

it's all about Dexter's Laboratory

<<i mean they have one about a milkshake and a meatball thats pretty
damn good.>>

I was watching The Usual Suspects on TNN last night, and apparently
they're switching their "paradigm" even more...they're going to become
"SPIKE tv" very soon...sort of like the polar opposite of
Lifetime..."all testosterone, all the time".

They, apparently, have some sort of deal with John Kriscfalusi to do new
Ren and Stimpy cartoons...this time aimed for adults...

I'm pretty geeked to see them, especially considering John K. is back on
the job.

Hey Kaleo - as I recall, Brother Mke and I tried calling you at least 12
diffrent times wanting to meet up with you but you were lame and you never
came up to our room or whatever.

by the way - that was me who made Mike call you Sunday Morning and pretend
to order room service.

I never did get my eggs and toast.

<<MTV2 is playing more and more non-music crap as they move towards pushing content out to the
dozens of other channels they're offering.>>

How have I missed this?

It's been "Bling Bling" videos every time I turn on that channel for the past 6 months.

I remember being excited about the prospect of MTV2 before I had digi-cable...I remember seeing it
briefly at friends' houses...I saw Aphex Twin videos, followed by radiohead, then they'd dip back
into the 80's for some obscure 'shoegazer' type band like The Mission UK or The Church. Then they'd
do something like The Roots. It was good, it was eclectic, it wasn't the same Clipse video twice an
hour, followed by "All Eyez On 50 Cent" for an hour, followed by MTV's $2 Bill Tour featuring
Clipse, then "50 Cent's Greatest MTV Moments of the Past 3 Weeks"

I've been watching a lot of VH1 Classic. Even the Toto videos from '78 are better than a lot of this
crap.

<<you have your choice of over 1500 things to watch when you sit down to your TV. (Yet, they all
seem to be crap)>>

Me = Still waiting for the 24 Hour Iron Chef channel.

Hi Listeners,
This is a quick note to ask you if you would be interested in giving 
some time to help all of us small webcasters fight for our survival. 
Most of you are aware of the unrealistic fees the Library of Congress 
and the record industry have leveled on us over the past year. If these 
fees do not come down we will all go out of business and you will have 
_no choice_ but to listen to what the record industry wants you to hear. 
If that means anything to you and you have a few spare minutes to 
volunteer, then please contact Ann Gabriel at the Webcaster Alliance: 
http://www.webcasteralliance.com/modules/contact/ Some of the tasks at 
hand are;  someone to surf the internet for us and expand on the list of 
potential media/consumer watchdog groups we have begun to gather. The 
second would be someone (or a few someones) who would be interested in 
becoming the "poster child" for Internet Radio listeners.  Someone that 
the average consumer can respond to ... who we can point the media to 
for quotes from the listener perspective.
I know you are busy but we sure could use your help.
Thanks,
Tom Mondell

this year and the Institute tent near the grassy knoll. We really lucked out
with the weather this year! Finally went to an afterparty Sunday night - the
one with Phantom 45 and Justin Long - awesome vibe except the the venue was
like 200 degrees and they ran out of water..

Not to mention a lot of the booths sound this year was tolerable. Very
interesting weekend! I had loads of fun.. I didn't get to see alot of you
guys from the list, and was kinda confused at where the netmeet was going to
be at this year. Did anyone get to it on time?!...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Post-Movement

oi, this thing is my desktop for shure

detroit was flat out the craziest, biggest event i've ever been to
the music kinda dissapointed, i was not into some of the performances
at all, i really wanted to hear more techno, but it seems i got
lots of house music.

it was kinda expensive for a free party, it seems like taxes are really 
high in michigan or something.

otherwise it was great, i couldn't get enough of the crowds.
getting to walk around the place at 3AM when it was all empty
was pure joy,

big up to the ponchartrain hotel, it was some serious james bond shit 
sometimes to try and get into the rooms, and the name is absolute fun to 
try and spell over a cell phone

big up to all the cleveland kids on floor 23, and thanks for all the 
open windows

Subject: {pb-cle} FEELGOOD mixtape help please

I am desperately trying to find a copy of a mixtape. It's Feelgood LIve 
Bassrush '96 (maybe '97) from Kentucky. at the begining there is drumming 
and chanting/singing "When i feel you, you make me lose all control like a 
fire burning into my soul yeah... and when i see you it feels like i'm in 
heaven my body goes on.. forever like a diamond or gold" It also has some 
chill D & B at the end on the second side.

For any of you that have been on the list for some time know how big of a 
FEELGOOD fan i am. I stupidly lost my first copy of the tape and my second 
copy was borrowed and never returned. Help me please!!!

peassh & luvin

-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Featuring

>>>>>>John Tejada:

Palette.  7th City. Residual. Tigersushi. Twisted Funk. Los Angeles

Normally associated with his peers in Techno from Detroit,
Europe and elsewhere in the US and the world, John Tejada has
embraced electronic music as a personal frontier, expanding on
his formidable resume as a Techno recording artist --as producer
and remixer, DJ, and label owner. With dozens of singles,
remixes, some film and TV work and contributions to sample CDs
to his credit, this recent expansion has born a slew of tracks
deeply informed by his uncompromised aesthetic--honed over years
of diligent production--which finds its roots in Detroit Techno
but references a far broader range of music, both in and outside
of electronic music. His musically formative years were steeped
in Classical music, growing up in family of performing
artists--his mother a soprano singer and his father a
conductor--which then widened to include hip hop, DJing and
finally, electronic music.

Known for crafting a brand of subtle, musical techno, his
recorded output ranges across tempo and genre lines, from
chilled out affairs with spacious arrangements to pulsating,
densely layered, deeply energetic tracks that work magnificently
in the hands of DJs as well as on the home stereo. Earlier on,
his music found release on labels such as A13, Multiplex and
Generation R&S. Following on to those successes, he established
his own imprint, Palette, in Los Angeles, in 1996, and has
enjoyed six years of steady growth and recognition. The label
has served as an exclusive outlet for his own prodigious output
but has recently begun to expand its roster. To date the label
has 25 releases with several more slated for release over the
next few months including "More Backstock," the second
compilation of Palette Recordings tracks mixed by John Tejada.

While much of Tejada's work has been released on his own Palette
imprint, he has also continued to record for other labels such
as Plug Research, Seventh City, Moods and Grooves, deFocus, Sino
and others, often in collaboration with 11 year long
collaborator Arian Leviste.  In addition to these numerous
singles, he has also produced six albums; two for A13, and one
each for deFocus, Plug Research, Moods and Grooves and Palette.
A seventh album "Fairfax Sake" is set for release at the end of
May on the highly regarded Playhouse Recordings. While John
Tejada is renown for his original production, he is also an in
demand remix artist.  Remixes to be released soon include
remixes for Phont Records, Re:Jazz on Infracom, and a remix for
Ben Mono on Compost.  In addition, he recently collaborated with
Titonton Duvanté for a Rima remix on Jazzanova Compost.

Other upcoming remixes include a remix for Dj Jinxx on Black
Jack Records, a remix of The Postal Service for Subpop Records,
as well as a remix for Fabrice Lig on Ray Gun Records. Another
Tejada side project worth mentioning is a collaboration with
Takeshi Nishimoto called "I'm Not a Gun." This project borders
on a post rock, jazzy rock type style with John playing drums,
guitar, and bass along with Takeshi who provides most of the
more polished guitar work. The album, "Everything At Once" is
released on Berlin's City Centre Offices label. A twelve inch of
the track "make sense and loose" will be released shortly
featuring remixes by John, Ulrich Schnauss, and Smyglyssna.




>>>>>>Titonton Duvanté

Residual. Jazzanova Compost.  Bitasweet. Visions.  2000 Black

Fresh back from his 18th tour of Europe, Titonton Duvanté
continues to expand his reputation as an innovator and a
Columbus based ambassador of electronic music to the world.
Mr. Duvanté has over 35 releases, including two full length
albums, on labels such as UK based 2000 Black and Visions, as
well as the Italian label Archive, and his own Residual
Recordings, to name just a few.  He is also a new member of the
Jazzanova Compost label artist roster and recently remixed "Let
it go," the second single off of the freshly released Rima album
"This World."  He is currently hard at work on his third full
length album, "Perversions." In addition to production, Mr.
Duvanté is renown as a top notch performer, earning him the
honor of being the first American DJ to have performed at the
definitive Broken Beat night, Co-op, in London this past
October.


>>>>>>Thomas James

Residual. Proceed.

Thomas James is cofounder of the Columbus based and
internationally renown record label Residual Recordings and a
veteran Midwest promoter and DJ.  He is also the resident DJ for
and one half of the promotional team behind "Proceed," Ohio’s
only live performance-based electronic music event.

this is a no bullshit party- no gimmicks, no frills- just bangin music and 
lots of dancing. do not come to this event if you are too cool to talk 
with strangers or too cool dance. we hope to amplify the positive vibe of

positive aspects of the scene, there may not be room for you. presales are 
6 bucks; door admission is 10, so save some money and ensure your entry.
alcohol is ok if you have a photo id with your birthdate on it, but alas, 
you must bring your own.
venue is an intimate, dirty, one-room warehouse; perhaps your white ufo's 
aren't the right attire :)  (dress accordingly). directions available on 
the day of the event on our website
DJ's
7-UP- as if this seasoned veteran still needs a write up . . . if you 
haven't heard yet, listen up!
JEFFERSON FUNK- aka Paode- this performance will feature some wicked 
breakbeat turntablism.
ORORO- a finalist and winner in several Columbus DJ competitions, Ororo is 
set to cave the place in with her funky disco house and hints of 2-step.
APX- the hard, dark sound of APX united with the harsh lyrical style of 
Method Failure is a demonstration not to be missed- featuring selections 
from their upcoming album.
DJ REDSHIFT- nasty, gritty DnB
DONKEYPUNCH- hard warehouse techno
DJ NO- trance
PROFESSOR BLAZE- DnB

headrushmusic presents
 
saturday, may 31
JOHN HOWARD (om records, san francisco)

Part Two of the Summer Series 2003
 
Join us for John's four-hour set.
 
John Howard is a legend in house music. He started DJing in 1993, during 
San Francisco’s infamous Summer of Love. John’s first regular appearances 
were at Groove Kitchen and the Boogie Buffet with Mark Farina. Then on to 
Stompy Stomp, Together with Dubtribe, Spundae, and Wicked.

John’s sound is smooth San Fran funk fused with a large dose of Chicago 
style, combined with his own brand of eclectic jazz and Bay Area 
influences. It’s always funky and it’s always different.

You've heard John rock it on the critically acclaimed SF Sessions Series 
from OM Records. And now he’s rising as a producer, with his track “Buddha 
Cowboy” appearing on OM’s 100th Release double CD.  Visit 
http://www.headrushmusic.com to listen to a mix set by John Howard and to

Sat Jun 14                          SE7EN                           NE Ohio

On Saturday, June 14th, 2003 Unified Entertainment, Wishing Well, and 
Phareal Productions bring you up to Northeast Ohio again for.........

"SE7EN"

Pride, Anger, Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, and Lust.

These are the things that come between people in general, promoters, 
cities, and different scenes that end up destroying it if it isn't fixed. 
This event will feature djs from all over and the main theme is for us to 
look at what we do every day that might hurt our scene and work on 
changing it. We think that if we can all throw away the bickering and the 
arguing this area of Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Dayton, 
Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Indianapolis, Nashville, and any other 
cities that are involved in our scene every week will be the talk 
everywhere as the places to be or just the Midwest in general.

Sat Jun 14                     SOMETHING TO DO                   Pittsburgh

Something To Do

Tired of saying there is nothing to do? Tired of the same ol' same ol' 
rave atmosphere? Tired of Mc Donalds trying to come up with something new 
and innovative but all they come up with is the Mc Bratwurst? Well thats 
too bad...sucks to be you.

But we are having an event that is an effort to re-establish the 
pittsburgh scene by giving you "Something To Do". This will not be the 
typical rave, this wont be the typical club, and this wont be the typical 
not rave/not club. What we are trying to do is make this a bi-weekly event 
in which we bring in DJ's and or bands that YOU want to hear and that we 
can afford...not what these promoters think you want to hear. As well as 
bringing in what you want to hear, we also throw some new faces into the 
mix. I mean lets face it, it seems that every flyer you look at has the 
same DJ's, the same tag team specials and the same venues all of the time. 
Time for a change. Depending on the turn out of this first event, we will 
have an event where we bring the variety stylee every other saturday. Some 
of the things to do so far will be as follows:

Random Stuff FREE Raffles

Video Games

Answer a Trivia Question at the door and get $1 off (30 second time limit)

Vote for your favorite DJ of the night

Vote for local bands or djs that you would like to see at our event.

Vote for genres you would like to see more of at our event

Vote for the new president of Guam

Mainly we just want to hear your opinion, and give you something to do in 
this seemingly boring town.


The confirmed Dj's are as follows:

Cutups [Ragga] - Crazy ass ragga shit.

2rip [Not Trance] - Commin in with a suprise non trancey stylee

B Rivers [Hardcore] - Not that happy crap your mom gives you.

Jake vs. Dj Resolution (Faithindnb Systems) [DnB] - Wicked tag team from 
the up and comming big wigs.

E-ditty w/Mc Ja bless[DnB] - Thats right!! Ja bless comming the whole way 
from Flordia to rock it for you katz.

Dire Code [Screamo Hardcore Band]- Bringing the change up to the typical 
rave atmosphere, be sure to check them out.

Darkbert (Steel City Hardcore) [Experimental Thrashcore]- Bringing the 
craziness with a blend of noise and weird shit you've never heard before.

Price: $5 CHEAPER THAN 6.99!!!!!

Support us...we arent here to bank off of you, we are here to make things 
better for you. We do this for the people, not ourselves.

If you want to be heard, dont forget to bring demos!!!!!

P.S.- You know the drill, no DRUGS, no WEAPONS, no MARKERS, no NAKED 
PICTURES OF BEA ARTHUR, no CHEEZ WHIZ and TOWNHOUSE CRACKER 
SANDWITCHES..... because they will be taken from you.

headrushmusic presents

:: saturday, june 28 ::
:: part three of the summer series 2003 ::

JERRY BONHAM  (bedrock, renaissance, saw, spundae, san francisco)

Jerry Bonham, a pioneer in progressive, has been doing what he does best
for almost three decades. Jerry is a living legend - one of the true
beacons of electronic dance music.

Born in North Dakota, Jerry Bonham grew up listening to pop music from the
'70's, everything ranging from Barry White, and Sly to the Family Stone.  
In 1976 at the height of the Disco Era, Jerry ventured into Minneapolis,
where he began his DJing career. Later, Michael Graber, a Chicago DJ,
introduced Jerry to the infinite possibilities of mixing and live
composition, guided him away from simply being a mobile DJ. Instead of
playing only the hits like many fellow jockeys of that time, Jerry favored
the less-obvious works.

In 1988, he relocated from Minneapolis to San Francisco, where he became
engrossed in its local scene and fell in love with the people, the music
and the city. In early 1996, Jerry started his residency at San Fran's
super club Spundae/Nikita at 1015 Folsom. As the partnership grew, he
became co-owner of the Spundae Reckords Store located on Haight Street.

Jerry Bonham's DJing career on the dance floor skyrocketed during the late
'90's, his production standards paralleled the rise, hit after hit. In
1998, Jerry's first mix CD, "Interpretations," was released on Spundae
Recordings, followed by his celebrated 1999 release "Tranceglobalnation 3"
on Arcade America, one of Europe's most respected and influential
electronic dance music labels. "Interpretations II" is Jerry's latest mix
compilation released on Mute and Spundae Recordings. The CD was an instant
hit with 20,000 pre-sold copies.

In the recording studio, Jerry forged on to refine his progressive sound,
recording a remix of Expansion's "Listen" for the Texas based Funked-Up
Label. He is also part of the JSJ collective, also known as Jondi, Spesh,
and Jerry Bonham. Together, they recorded "Deep Love 9" and "Ghost of You"
on Renaissance; both tracks became the must-haves in a DJ's crate - two
absolute floor-fillers. In early 2001 Jerry recorded the single "Erendira"
(Spanish for "joy") with Planetary Consciousness on Bedrock. His recent
studio work is the solo track called "Seventh Seal", a 12-minute long
journey that opens with beautiful tunes and stripped drums, eventually
evolving into a complex web of progressive sounds and melodies.

John Digweed noted Jerry as a "world-class DJ", who "has been one of the
main pioneers of the progressive sound on the West Coast since the very
start, forever championing the latest sounds and pushing the music
forward." Dave Ralph added that Jerry is "the most underrated DJ in
America, who has real talent and depth."

Jerry Bonham has helped to define America's electronic dance music
movement with his flawless performances, and extraordinary production
skills.  Forever influencing the music, Jerry Bonham continues to love the
music as passionately as he lives and creates it.

Sat Jul 19                       JEDI NIGHT                          Toledo

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Jedi Night
July 19th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring Djs:

Josh the Funky 1 - Chicago, IL - House - Funktion Recordings , IHR, Kid
Dynamite Recordings

Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, and
breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks.

In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In
the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at the
Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.

Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh
has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , "Bangin the
Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

As if his DJ'ing accomplishments weren't enough, Josh has also had his
hand in the studio producing tracks for the infamous Chicago labels I.H.R,
Kid Dynamite, and Strictly Hype Recordings. His tracks have been featured
on mix compilations and DJ play-lists throughout the world, further
establishing his reputation as a DJ/Producer. Josh has also lent a hand in
remixing for Chicago's number one house diva, Dajae. Her first single on
Kid Dynamite records entitled "Time" is an uplifting vocal anthem that has
received Billboard attention and has since been licensed to Credence
records in U.K. Most Recently Josh has re-mixed Dajae's newest single
"Everyday", also on Kid Dynamite records and already licensed to Defected
Records U.K.

Not one to be content with only producing records for other labels. In
2001 "The Funky 1" launched his own record label, Funktion Recordings. The
first release "Everybody Everywhere" by BSJ and Fun-K has found its way
into the record boxes of DJ's worldwide.

2003 shows no signs of slowing down as producers such as Santos Scanty,
and Jelo continue to churn out dancefloor stormers for his label. When not
in the studio or running the label, Josh is constantly touring the world
bringing his sound and skills together for the masses.

E-Sassin - Los Angeles, CA - DnB - Sound Sphere Recordings, Phunkatek
Recordings, Just Two

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran of the
Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical journey in the
late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and jazz/fusion bands which
helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. After a short stint in
the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to the electronic dance
scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. "Once I started getting
into producing dance music, I finally felt I was on the right track to
where I wanted to be musically. My reputation as a cutting edge producer,
and later as a DJ, steadily grew, and so did the work.

In 1992 E-Sassin produced and self-released a techno album which got the
attention of Sunshine Records. They approached E-Sassin to work with the
groups L.A. Rave and The Movement. At this time The Movement's single,
"Jump Everybody Jump" was charting on Billboard's Hot 100 so for a year
and a half E-Sassin was touring with The Movement all over the world.
"During that time I was exposed to many different music scenes and
cultures. That's when I was first exposed to jungle. Jungle at that time
had just broken away from the breakbeat hardcore scene and what really
hooked me on the music was the way it combined the different styles of
music together with a more forward thinking use of technology. The intense
drum programming and the tweeking of sounds pushed the boundaries of the
available technology, which to me made it possible for new technology and
programming techniques to be created just to keep up with the demand.
That's progressive music by any definition" By 1996, E-Sassin had made the
transition into producing only drum and bass. "Even in '96 drum and bass
wasn't too widely accepted in the States and very few domestic labels were
releasing any of it, so I decided to start up my own label".

Sound Sphere Recordings came to light and the first two releases received
so much positive feedback, it quickly established a high level of
credibility for the label and for E-Sassin's productions. Subsequent
releases have continued to elevate Sound Sphere Recordings, which has
gained the label well earned respect from both American and European
artists. Sound Sphere Recordings is one of the pioneering West Coast
labels to be dedicated exclusively to drum and bass and continues to be a
leader in superior quality domestic pressings and high profile releases.
Currently, E-Sassin is producing and re-mixing tracks to be released on
Sound Sphere Recordings and other prospective labels. Recent works include
re-mixes of Tha Truth's, "Red Lights", which is featured on the mixed CD
"Urban Jungle", for Priority Records, UFO!'s, "Enemy Infiltration" from
Thermal Recordings forthcoming on Sound Sphere, and 60 Channels' "Give Me
Your Love" for World Domination Recordings. He is also a featured artist
on the much respected album, "The World of Drum & Bass" on Formation
Records, which showcases some of the best talent from around the world.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)

The time is 1200 hours the date is 10/18/03 and the location is Pittsburgh 
PA.  The company that brought you a revolutionary event is now back to 
bring you the much-anticipated sequel to a phenomenon that began 1 year 
ago.  We gave much thought about how we could improve our event from last 
year and we decided to eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes 
brutal outdoors so we moved the legacy that started it all indoors into a 
beautiful large facility located in the heart of the steel city. We wanted 
to assure everyone’s safety this year and keep our show as a one of kind 
superstar import car event.  Even though we wont be racing vehicles this 
year there will be tons of fun, and many different creative things going 
on.  I will have to keep you in suspense about most of the activities that 
we have planned until the time is right but I will give you brief taste of 
what is in store for SO2.  Picture an event like you have never witnessed 
before lights, visuals, sound, lasers, dancers, djs, mc’s, models, free 
stuff, contests, entertainers, many different automobile divisions, tons 
of cash prizes, a outdoor portion and indoor portion, and much more TBA!  
If you thought that Street Outlawz was as good as gets you won’t believe 
your eyes when SO2 hits the city. So prepare yourself for an event that 
will once again go down into the history of the Steel City!


ELECTRONIC MUSIC:
	(These are only a few of the major headliners that will be 
featured at the event please stay posted to our website 
www.steelcityracing.com for more detailed information)

DRUM N BASS:

FREAKY FLOW w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone can’t get enough of 
his outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If it’s not 
magazines then it’s live TV the Freaky Flow combination has truly been 
just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didn’t have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!




UFO! (Drum N Bass)
(Phracktel/ Phunckateck/ Phylum Recordings-SF)

The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!  Please don’t be alarmed by 
the name the aliens are not really coming.  However this is just one more 
incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he his mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that 
whenever he drops his dubs the dance floor will be screaming for more.  If 
you hadn’t had the chance to see this west coast legend then allow 
yourself the time to hit the dance floor at SO2 for an unforgettable 
musical experience!

AND MORE TBA!

If it’s trance that you love then you won’t want to miss this outstanding 
Pittsburgh native by the name of Ryan Matthews.  This young superstar 
tears up the dance floor every time he hits the decks playing an 
outstanding selection of emotional and heart pounding trance that leaves 
you in a state of pure euphoria.  

E-DITTY- (Trance)
The dark haired maniac is back again he’s the player hater that you all

fantastic very rare all live performance.  This is another do not miss 
performer that adds to our obvious love for electronic music!

TWO STEP

Cheshire w/Mc Gravity-(2-step/Warren OH)
We gave much thought to this and we decided to choose one performer to 
strictly represent the 2 step scene and this performer is no other than 
the one the only DJ Cheshire! Chris a.k.a Cheshire is a one of kind 
performer his smooth intellectual attitude gives his style a unique 
separation that blows up dance floors every time he hits the stage.  The 
love of his music is obvious with the energy that he displays every time 
he drops another funky beat. We couldn’t get enough of this incredible

Subject: {pb-cle} Audio Questions

I have two questions that I am sure someone on the list can answer for me.

1) I have a Sound Blaster MP3+ card in my PC. I know its shit as far as 
audio processors go, but it serves me pretty well. I like running it to my 
home stereo, but it sounds extra crappy through the line outs that have 
already been processed. There is a digital out on the card that looks like a 
headphone jack. I suspect this bypasses all processing. I have two kinds of 
digital inputs on my receiver. One that is the standard notched square fiber 
optic jack, and one that looks like a standard RCA. Presumably, thats the 
jack that will mate to my sound card. What's that cable called, and where 
can I get one?


2) My friend has a similar situation with his Mac. He wants suggestions for 
a reasonably high quality sound card, and also suggestions on how to run it 
to his stereo. I suppose the answer to the above question, will apply to the 
second part of this, however.

Thanks for any help in this here sit-chee-ay-shun

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Audio Questions

I've suggested the run of the mill radio shack ground loop isolators in
the past, but if they fail, they can cause fires and damage all sorts of
equipment. 

I would seem to me as though you have a TOSLINK optical and Coaxial (the
RCA looking thing) in on your receiver. I checked Creative's site to
check what kind of output the card has, and there's no manual online.
BASTARDS! I have a feeling what you're looking for is:
http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY
_DisplayProductInformation-Start;sid=qCYOtlmChNkOtWdUt2AEvRaTxVzYXkDKrcc
=?CatalogCategoryID=LKsKC0%2eNel4AAAD1JwSOZmju&ProductID=lj4KC0%2eNSU8AA
AD1C7yOZmjx&Dept=pa

There are two models of your soundcard, one with 5.1 and one that's just
stereo, so you might want to check out what I'll suggest for you mac
friend for your PC...

And as for your Mac friend, if he's/she's only listening and not
recording I HIGHLY recommend the m-audio sonica. It's cheap
(relatively), USB, and very high quality in every aspect.
http://www.m-audio.com/products/consumer/sonica_page1.php. Microcenter
has them for $59.99, although there's one in the columbus store right
now on the discount racks for ~$40.

The only thing that bugs me about optical connections is I haven't been
able to find a TOSLINK cable longer than a few feet. 

- Mike

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Audio Questions

if i remember correctly, the 5.1 out on any soundblaster is analog
only. When you're doing digital out, it's 2.1. no digital support
for 5.1.

i could be wrong tho.

Thanks to everyone for the input...

As far as USB is concerned, I recently got a new mobo with USB2.0

480Mbps, yo. Quicker than firewire even.

I can burn a cd in about 2 minutes including lead-in and lead-out time.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Audio Questions

Naw, I don't agree. I've got a 800Mhz TiBook and a Quatro and I have 3ms
latency with Live and Cubase, that is recording while playing back a few
dozen tracks. With Jaguar, I get similar results with the built in audio
controller (yes, the crap built in soundcard) -- it's all about core
audio aka features ripped directly from BeOS. There is no core audio in
OS9, and simply put, exponentially more processing is needed to do
multitrack audio, and you can experience unwanted latencies even with an
ASIO driver. OMS doesn't cut it. There are a lot of other issues to look
at when you're dealing with Mac audio, and simply put, if you're not
using the latest and greatest OS and patches, don't expect anything
quality. There's no pros or cons to using a PCI card or a USB interface
as information goes to and fro through the bus serially and full duplex
in either case. Note, none of this matters in windows, where USB I/O
handling varies from OS to OS on the same machine, let alone different
USB controllers, etc. WinME doesn't do 24bit audio support, and 98se
requires a patch bonanza.

Check this table http://www.usbpre.com/datarates.htm to give you a
better idea of the actual bandwidth needed to do 24bit/96Khz audio...
You can do 24bit, 96k audio only be using roughly a third of the USB 1.1
bus bandwidth.

As far as the edirol device...

Edirol is notorious for piss poor Mac driver support until recently. I
think they rolled out the 1.0.0 driver for OS X in march -- my own UM-20
was a steaming pile of dung until I upgraded. They shipped beta drivers
for this thing for what seemed like forever. The windows support is even
worse if you're using anything that's not XP. Just try and imagine

for you mac friend...tell him to get a firewire or pci audio card if he

So, I finally bought some new webspace the other day, and encoded my =
newest mixes for streaming (even for dialup).

You can email me for tracklistings.

* DJ Soniq Stylz - "Disc Breaks" - Dusted off some crates and pulled out =
some older and brand new (for me) tracks.

RA: http://66.197.58.176/audio/breaksmix.ram

MP3: http://66.197.58.176/audio/breaks.mp3=20

* DJ Soniq Stylz - "Housewrecka v. 4" - Probably the summer mix I'll be =
running with, 74 minutes of hard dance, including an original track in =
the mix.

RA: http://66.197.58.176/audio/housewrecka4.ram=20

MP3: http://66.197.58.176/audio/Housewrecka_v_4.mp3=20


* DJ Soniq Stylz - "Soundtrack To The Preparty" - Chilled out house, =
speed garage, and breaks, building in tempo and beats.  My first and =
only (so far) pure computer-aided mix.

RA: http://66.197.58.176/audio/soundtrack_to_the_preparty.ram=20

MP3: http://66.197.58.176/audio/soundtrack_to_the_preparty.mp3=20

If some of the mp3 links don't work, I'll have them up in a couple =
hours.

Subject: {pb-cle} Cook Da Goose Tres was Re: {pb-cle} Good News/Bad News 

k, everyone hit me up private stylee if you're willing to help, i'll create
a distribution list and we'll get it in the works... silently i had been
holding off on really setting a venue because this had been in the works for
me to move there and i wasnt sure... but now i can definately start to find
a good venue to work with as well as confirming all the dj talent that wants
to spin...the direction i did want to go this year was more of something
similar to field day last year, with an outdoor venue (mike g suggested
nelsons ledges, there was mention of using the brimfield campground, etc),
camping, etc...

DJ's I had already confirm they wanted to spin:
Tom
Jwan
Soniq
Mark
Lemma
Ratana
Moose
Skillz
Nick (DEA CRU)

That's what I had saved in a folder at least...

Hit me back

#1. Tom is always hostile, this is true.  Don't think everyone else on
this list is. #2. Why can't the BOTH of you learn to reply to the sender
only, instead of replying to all?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Good News/Bad News

See, now here is a man with a plan!  I've got a Sam's Club card too and
I'm not afraid to use it.  Dosen't somebody have one of those junk mail
things where you can get like 50 steaks from Swanson's or something for a
discounted rate?  Resources people, I know you guys have them, now it's
time to utilize them.  Maybe we can do a potluck thing where everyone
brings a dish, and a few selected (generous) people can go in to Sam's and
get all of the meat?  Where there is a will there is a way and I'm willing
to throw down for CDGIII!

No offense, Marisa, but:

1) I don't see Tom rocking the caserole-style.
and
2) I don't know that I'd eat anything Paul "Badger-Boy" Fleetwood prepared prior to
arriving....y'never know what's in there.

Plus, depending on where this is, some of us may have to travel, and I'D have a problem eating my
OWN cooking after it's sat in a car for four or so hours...

Steaks will stay...um, steak-y(?) ...in a cooler...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Good News/Bad News

None taken.

I was just throwing an idea out there.  Obviously I was a little excited
about CDG and I would still like to see it happen.  You see CDG had a nice
little fit in my summer plans - CDGIII, then that Monday is my b-day, then
that weekend is WEMF (yay!), take a weekend off, and then go see Cirque du
Soleil.  Plus, there are so many of you out there that I haven't had the
pleasure of meeting even though I've been on this list since '98.  I know,
it's sad.

I'm getting side tracked here though.  Basically I will do what I can to
make this happen.  Granted, no one can do this by themselves and this has
to be a group effort, but I think it can be done.  I throw myself at the
mercy of the list, I'm here if needed.

Marisa

P.S.  Although it would be interesting to see what concoctions people
would come up with as a dish ;o)

Heh...who needs food at a good party anyway??
Some multi vitamins and some beef jerky usually
do the trick :]

another thing to note, there were problems with the cops last year in 
Brimfield, but if you wanna do the event there, I may be able to help a 
little bit on that front if they give us problems again.  My father is 
Police Chief in Brimfield, so if needs be, I can always play that card in 
the event that said cop problems occur again.  Last year I got there a bit 
too late in the evening to be of any help...

          Yes  nelsons  ledges  is  an option  you  can basically   do 
whatever you  want  out there . Also ive  been  sitting  on  this idea     for  a  
while. As   sum of  you may remember   from a   few  years  ago  there  was  a 
private list  party over  whatever you want  to call it.That  went  by the  
name  of  "Detoure". Now  i  dont know about  you guys  but  i  had  a  great  
time,great people...........fucking  awesome  venue!!!!!  thats  all im  gonna  
say  about  that.Now i know  most of the time  i lurk in the shadows of the 
pb-cle  drama  land but i am  willing to  help  out  in anyway  needed. Im  
right in downtown cleveland.  i have an office full of supplies  at my disposal  
24 hrs  a day.....this  includes a  t-1  line   high speed copy machines and 
and  damn near everything else u can imagine. Also  2 technic m3d's. So if the  
cook the  goose idea does not  pan  out....I say we just  do another  do 
another  "Detoure" and  just call it  cook the  goose 3 or whatever   but 
seriously  we should make this happen theres  no reason  not to  have another  pb-cle 
event. Okay im dont going off on a  tangent  now.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Cook Da Goose Tres was Re: {pb-cle} Good News/Bad News

I was checking the nelsons ledges rules, and I don't think it would work
there anyway. Here's some of their rules:

2. NO GLASS CONTAINERS ANYWHERE. PLEASE BRING CANS. ANY GLASS BOTTLES IN
THE PARK WILL BE CONFISCATED. No containers of any kind on the lake.
(Ok, this is doable, garbage cans are plastic.)

6. NO ONE UNDER 21 PERMITTED TO CONSUME ALCOHOL IN THIS PARK and
excessive use of alcoholic beverages will not be tolerated. (I guess
they have to define "Excessive")

7. No dogs or pets. (too easy)

8. NO AXES OR SAWS PERMITTED! 

11. Please be aware of your noise level. Some sites are close to each
other. Not everyone enjoys the same music. (To be renamed "The Tom Cox
Rule".)

15. Beach and playground are the children's areas: no alcohol,
profanity, thongs, or .cigarette butts. (NO THONGS!?!?! An outrage!!!)

excessive is when you need your stomach pumped. i dont think
anyone that showed up last year was in danger of that. 

>8. NO AXES OR SAWS PERMITTED! 

its not a party if i cant bring an axe.

hahaha. we almost had to get violent at movement, some heads down
a couple hotel rooms from us had a loud ass sound system playing
craptrance. we had the decency to bring only a small fisher price
record player with us.

Ive spent almost every weekend at the Ledges for the last two years.  The 
age of people drinking really isnt regulated.  The noise rule is just 
hilarious to see they have it as a rule.  The only thing I see they really 
enforce is saws, glass bottles, dogs and you must be over 18.

  I was checking the nelsons ledges rules, and I don't think it would =
work
  there anyway. Here's some of their rules:

  2. NO GLASS CONTAINERS ANYWHERE. PLEASE BRING CANS. ANY GLASS BOTTLES =
IN
  THE PARK WILL BE CONFISCATED. No containers of any kind on the lake.
  (Ok, this is doable, garbage cans are plastic.)

  6. NO ONE UNDER 21 PERMITTED TO CONSUME ALCOHOL IN THIS PARK and
  excessive use of alcoholic beverages will not be tolerated. (I guess
  they have to define "Excessive")

  7. No dogs or pets. (too easy)

  8. NO AXES OR SAWS PERMITTED!=20

  11. Please be aware of your noise level. Some sites are close to each
  other. Not everyone enjoys the same music. (To be renamed "The Tom Cox
  Rule".)

  15. Beach and playground are the children's areas: no alcohol,
  profanity, thongs, or .cigarette butts. (NO THONGS!?!?! An outrage!!!)
