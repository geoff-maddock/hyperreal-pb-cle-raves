Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Termination!

You should see when they cut people loose.  They really need a Terminator.
One time they had people going out the door, escorted by the security chief.
Then, they fired the chief!

They hardly ever terminate 1 person.  They like to do it 20-30 at a time.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Johnny Fiasco / Om Records

"Those were the fastest years of my life," reminisces Johnny Fiasco about 
the early '90s, when he, Derrick Carter and Mark Farina were all spinning 
at Chicago house institution Shelter. Their residency served as the 
prelude to the Cajual Records era -- a time that would introduce the world 
to a sound that was truly inspirational.
"I was going to college full-time and spinning three nights a week, doing 
Thursdays at Shelter. It really was kind of a cultural clique-family that 
we had."
And he's been bringing people together ever since. Johnny's records are 
widely regarded as being some of the tightest tracks around. There's a 
depth, quality and complexity in his productions that make his house stand 
tall above the rest -- odds are that there's a Fiasco 12-inch sitting in 
every house aficionado's crate. Be they disco or Latin, his tracks simply 
reflect his current frame of mind while in the studio.

PETE MOSS (Ovum, Alola UK)

A native of the New England area, Pete Moss began his journey through
the dance music scene by spinning as a DJ at local Boston venues and
parties. His skills advancing with every gig, Pete quickly found himself
spinning throughout the Greater New England area as his reputation
became known for keeping the dance floor jumping. This development led
to regular engagements, which have kept Pete busy for the last nine
years. Pete has played the likes of England, Scotland, Switzerland,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico and has toured throughout the United States. Some of
his more notable gigs have been at Twilo in New York City, Ministry of
Sound in London, Headstart with Josh Wink in London, Centrofly in New
York City, and the weekly Release party in San Francisco. Pete has also
held down the Ovum Records party at the Annual Winter Music Conference
in Miami for the last three years.

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 5

STEVE GERRARD (Bedrock/Wrecked Angle / Filta)

"Steve Gerrard is another DJ who is making a name for himself by
delivering great sets everywhere he goes. He always rocks it at Bedrock
when he plays." -- John Digweed 

Chris from Hybrid said in Muzik magazine, "Steve is one of the best up
and coming DJs I've heard in a long time. He has very similar tunes in
his box to me, actually - deep, progressive tracks that aren't too
shiny! I walked into a club recently and he was playing most of the
stuff I was going to play... God knows where he gets all those tunes!"

In 1998, Steve won Muzik Magazine's Bedroom Bedlam competition, and 2
years later won the Ericsson Award for Best Bedroom Bedlam DJ. Since
then his career has gone from strength to strength. With influences that
range from Sasha and Digweed, Nick Warren and Danny Howells to Adam
Freeland and Hybrid and the technical skills of Anthony Pappa, he has
developed a unique style, which is: deep, progressive house mixed with
breakbeat, building steadily and creating a set which is more than the
sum of its parts. All the while keeping in mind that it is his job to
make people want to dance and keep on dancing.

Dj Nitro is back for an encore.

 

DJ Nitro has quickly become one of the rising stars of the Midwest. 
Starting out at after-hours parties in St. Louis, Nitro built his 
following from the ground up.  He has played at shows across America from 
San Francisco to Detroit and all points in between. In 1999, he broke the 
international barrier, playing Toronto. Nitro calls his style Disco-Tech. 
"Most house music", Nitro remarks, "doesn’t usually have enough energy to 
move a crowd at peak hour - But when you give 'em something hard mixed 
with something funky, the people on the floor can't help but dance."

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 6

TY TEK (Phrunky, Casa Del Soul, Dirty Blue, Movim)
www.djtytek.com

Ty’s been playing records for eight years and producing for six. Born
and raised in Pueblo, CO. Brought up on a healthy diet of bands such as
TKK, Skinny Puppy, Coil, and Nitzer Ebb, Ty knew that music was the
career of his future. Self taught and eager to play, Ty found his first
residency at Evolution Night Club (Pueblo, CO, 1994-1996), with a four
night per week schedule. Ty moved to Denver, CO in 1997 for a Film/Video
Production degree. In this time, Ty met Koa Franconi (Superstar
Productions/ DJ Keoki’s brother) and started one of the longest Thursday
club/dance nights in Denver’s history. With crowds reaching 1500+ a
night, Ty was able to spread his musical message to the masses. Tracks
2000 closed it's doors in 2001, but this was far from the end. Factory
Of Dreams Night Club has taken it's place with the same old school feel
the original Tracks 2000 was notorious for. Check out
www.factoryofdreams.com 

Ty met Jason and Brad of Together Productions and started a new night to
fill the place of Tracks 2000’s hiatus. Vinyl Night Club
(www.1082broadway.com) is one of Denver’s premier hot spots, with
National and International talent showcased on a weekly basis. Ty began
his Saturday night residency here and has been able to play alongside
some of the worlds best DJ’s. ( Richie Hawtin, Derrick May, Carl Cox,
Fat Boy Slim, Pete Tong, Derrick Carter, Saeed & Palash, Deep Dish, DJ
Dan, Moby, Donald Glaude, and many more of the same caliber).  Ty also
has found a residency every other Saturday at the world-renowned Denver
club, The Church. Some of the biggest names in electronic music have
made their way through this magnificent club. Check out
www.the-church.com . Ty's style ranges from funky tech-house to tribal
to progressive. His style is geared towards the room being played.

Alongside label partner Little Mike, Ty runs his own record label, which
is already gaining momentum and receiving acclaim from the worlds top
DJ’s and producers. Check out www.phrunky.com for all info regarding
this label. In 1999 Ty joined Casa Del Soul. This group of DJ's: Sensé,
Catt, Foxx, Little Mike, and Wyatt Earp, are friends; co-workers within
the Casa Del Soul Record Label and the leading choice of talent in
Colorado. Their main focus is to push innovative music to their
listeners. Casa Del Soul Records has received critical acclaim by
DJ’s/Producers from all over the world with releases from Ty Tek &
Little Mike "Casafied Modern Music 2" featured on Lee Burridge’s
Nu-Breed mix compilation. Other Casa releases have found homes on
compilations from Lexicon Avenue, Doc Martin (Fabric 10) and was on
Muzik magazine’s list of top tech-house recommened labels of 2002.

Jul 16-18                         TEKNIVAL                     Toronto area

Calling all Soundsystems! 

The Toronto Freetekno community will be collaborating once again to 
generate a 2004 teknival. From July 16 to 18 a quiet patch of Ontario 
crown land will become a temporary musical playground for anyone and 
everyone with ears. The event will of course be 100% free. People can show 
up as early as they'd like (some crews may be showing up as early as july 
9) and stay as long as they'd like, until the last partier hits the 
ground. 

ANY and ALL Soundsystems are invited to come set up camp and Jam along 
side the bizarre collection of deranged Torontonians that has come to be 
known as freeteknotoronto. Even if you've never thrown a jam before, feel 
free to get a crew together and set up a stage. You've got the knowlege of 
some seasoned veterans to draw from. Last year we were lucky to be joined 
by collectives from across Ontario, from Quebec and from New York. This 
year promises to be bigger, harder, ect. ect. 

A release of pre-flyers will be circulating in Toronto by mid March. 
We would like an idea of how many stages will be represented this year, so 
if you plan on coming and would like to be included please contact us with 
a YES/NO/MAYBE by the first week in March. More informative flyers should 
hit the street by June 1. If you would like a write-up to appear in these 
flyers, please let us know. 

Also feel free to design your own teknival flyer or web graphic to 
send around to your crew/city/whatever. There's already 3 collectives in 
toronto working on separate designs, reps from other cities are ideal. 
Teknival is a decentralized non-hierarchical event meaning no one person 
or system plans it. It also means that if someone doesn't make it happen, 
it won't. Take it into your own hands and make this event the event you 
want it to be. 

Teknival Sound System Email List: 
If you'd like to be in the loop on the planning process and have your 
say or whatever just email this address and recieve all the communique's 
between systems.

Friday July 30      Cleveland, Ohio

Goahead presents The Third Eye V.6
featuring a full psytrance lineup with
our friends from Chicago and New York

S.O.T. (Synchronous Oscillation Technology)
T.O.U.C.H. Samadhi - Chicago

S.O.T(Igor) was transplanted from across the ocean nine years ago with
hopes to learn about this side of the world. At the end of his mission,
the Mothership came to take him back, however alien frequencies of
psychedelic trance lured him in and changed these plans. Based in Chicago,
he began playing/producing with one goal in mind "...to see more people go
ape-shit on a dance floor!.. loose themselves and get reborn.." Igor is
extending the T.O.U.C.H Samadhi healing energy to the Midwest; using
soaring leads and swinging basslines that are sure to keep you
"oscillating" well into the night.

Mp3's at:
http://synchronous.home.comcast.net/html/slide2.html

Dan Efex - Chicago
Dan Efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out
of even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed
shoulder to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an
energetic and intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who
consider him to be one of the founders of the Midwest’s trance scene, a
scene that is still strong and growing today. He was one of the first to
introduce the Midwest to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions
characteristic of some of his styles of trance. But although Dan is
perhaps best known for his trance, do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as
he is skilled! His repertoire of past events includes sets with
progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard techno, hard core, hard
house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it up and keeps it
interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and know precisely
what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind on his musical
excursions.

Ari D - New York/Russia - Goahead's NYC connection,
Ari has wide knowledge of the psytrance genre and that is evident in his
dj sets. Ari has been DJing since 1996, got hooked on psytrance in 2001.
Over the years Ari's sets have progressed to accent diversity of track
selection and variety of mixing techniques. Expect to get a proper taste
of psytekk,
progressive and full-on, all in a building blend of positive dancefloor
energy to get your smile & groove on.

Malachi - Goahead - Akron/Cleveland

The Third Eye v.5

Goahead productions continues The Third Eye ritual. Don’t
miss this soulful experience as we get deep into the roots!


Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

We are pleased to welcome our friends from berettamusic in Detriot

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------


BACKLASH
Sundays
at the CHURCH

ELECTRO - SYNTH-POP - ALTERNATIVE - CONNIE FUNK
INDUSTRIAL - NO WAVE - ANTI RAVE

and, yes....a bit of house and techno.

The simple premise of this latest incarnation of THE CHURCH is to provide 
a venue for the new electro-alternative sounds that are being, for the 
most part, ignored by Cleveland club nights and parties.

A mash-up of 20 years of musical sub-genres, the sound is as much familiar 
as it is foreign.

Resident DJs are Rob Sherwood, Briri, and Alex Holt. We are also actively 
seeking new, like-minded DJs to add to our line-up. Interested DJs should 
email ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net.

ALL ARE WELCOME, but if you do come to check us out, PLEASE don't come 
expecting The Church of yesteryear. We are re-building Sunday nights 2 
people at a time, and have a long, long way to go.

18 and over - doors at 10pm - FREE ADMISSION before 11pm - $5.00 after

We are trying to put together an email promotion list, so anyone mailing 
us at ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net before Sunday will be placed on the 
guest list for free admission for 2 people on Sunday 18th, April

Hope to see everyone this Sunday

For the party people who refuse to stop at 2am,

The Shadow Lounge hosts a weekly Friday night
afterhours dance party from 2am-5am. If anyone's down
for some latenight dancing to good soulful music (deep
house, nu jazz, funk) come on down for the party. The
vibe is relaxed and intimate. Some couches if you wish
to chill with a brew but the past few weeks have been
folks on the floor bumping 'n' hustling. Last time I
was there, people were on the tables, the bar
counters, shaking bootay, even breakdancing - a real
dance party a la NYC's Body & Soul or Paradise Garage.
Yours truly occasionally appears on the turntables as
does my DJ crew (Technoir Audio) alongside residents
DJ John Ep & Brother Mike. I'll be bringing some funky
disco records tonight, so if anyone wants to stomp
until sunrise....

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

You should see when they cut people loose.  They really need a Terminator.
One time they had people going out the door, escorted by the security chief.
Then, they fired the chief!

They hardly ever terminate 1 person.  They like to do it 20-30 at a time.

Hi -- some friends of mine and I were going to make a road trip for Bang 4
in Philadelphia this weekend (July 3) and stick around for the Penn's
Landing fireworks show, but we couldn't scrounge up enough peeps to go and
share a hotel room and stuff.  Anyone else going who wouldn't mind the
company of 3 fun people?  We could do our own driving; or if you have a
small group (1-2) we would be more than happy to let you join us!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: howard stern back in pgh...

mullet music is our pittsburgh culture. k-rock plays a variety of classic 
and on-the-way-to-be classic rock such as red hot chilly peppers.  i've 
listened to k-rock via internet in so cal for a few years on and off. they 
do some unique business. fuck a clear channel.  i'd like to see some better 
than x-fest / warped tour festivals come this way sponsored by them. we are 
missing alot of the grunge era, i hope they will help replace some of that.
this is no where near rave related.

It would seem that around here somtimes it is about the comback.  Which was kind of my whole point in the first place.  This is why I rarely post thing on this board.  But I read it everyday because you guys crack me up.  By the way nice use of the word blumpkin and I shall give my mother your regaurds.
 
peace

well lets sum up your argument: 

"blahblahblahblahblahbvlahbljsdhaskhjsfhjbkahfgashejkfsdafas"

i needed to come up with something, you didn't give me enough ammo 
to really let loose. you're just a garden variety idiot. you make 
no sense, your opinion isnt even grounded in anything resebling 
logic, and you're not witty. there's only so much i can do here.

for you tho in his place!

Artists:

Malachi - Goahead - Akron,Ohio
The man behind Goahead productions
Getting the psy-vibe started early.

Dj Meghan - Goahead - Cleveland
Meghan needs no introduction. She
has had numerous appearances at events
in the midwest and east coast and has released
a new mix cd "Spring Fever" which will be handed out
to a few lucky people. She has already gathered
alot of new material for this set!

Ari D - Goahead - New York City
Ari has wide knowledge of the psytrance genre and that is evident in his
dj sets. Ari has been DJing since 1996, got hooked on psytrance in 2001.
Over the years Ari's sets have progressed to accent diversity of track
selection and variety of mixing techniques. Expect to get a proper taste
of psytekk,progressive and full-on, all in a building blend of positive
dancefloor energy to get your smile & groove on.

S.O.T. (Synchronous Oscillation Technology)
T.O.U.C.H. Samadhi - Chicago
S.O.T(Igor) was transplanted from across the ocean nine years ago with
hopes to learn about this side of the world. At the end of his mission,
the Mothership came to take him back, however alien frequencies of
psychedelic trance lured him in and changed these plans. Based in Chicago,
he began playing/producing with one goal in mind "...to see more people go
ape-shit on a dance floor!.. loose themselves and get reborn.." Igor is
extending the T.O.U.C.H Samadhi healing energy to the Midwest; using
soaring leads and swinging basslines that are sure to keep you
"oscillating" well into the night.

Mp3's at:
http://synchronous.home.comcast.net/html/slide2.html

Kaiser Soze - Massive, PTLF - Milwaukee, WI.
Hailing from the brew city. Kaiser Soze has been djing goa/psy trance
since 1997. His style mixes old and new with a touch of the Milwaukee
hardcore feel. Be prepared for a non-stop roller coaster of wicked tunes.

Love Boms,
Luke/Dj Malachi

PETE MOSS (Ovum Recordings) - Saturday, July 3

A native of the New England area, Pete Moss began his journey through the dance music scene by spinning as a DJ at local Boston venues and parties. His skills advancing with every gig, Pete quickly found himself spinning throughout the Greater New England area as his reputation became known for keeping the dance floor jumping. This development led to regular engagements, which have kept Pete busy for the last nine years. Pete has played the likes of England, Scotland, Switzerland, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and has toured throughout the United States. Some of his more notable gigs have been at Twilo in New York City, Ministry of Sound in London, Headstart with Josh Wink in London, Centrofly in New York City, and the weekly Release party in San Francisco. Pete has also held down the Ovum Records party at the Annual Winter Music Conference in Miami for the last three years. 

Fond of Philadelphia, Pete Moss currently holds a Saturday night residency at the infamous Fluid nightclub in the historic South Street area known for its musical and cultural diversity. Pete entertains a usually packed crowd of loyal and appreciative house heads who praise Peteâ€™s skills by staying on the dance floor night after night.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: howard stern back in pgh...

I couldn't imagine not being able to listen to the Stern show.

I guess their BB got so many people trying to register today that it crashed
3 servers... Now they need to totally rebuild the system with a bunch of
server stacks to handle the traffic.

That's cool.

By the way, I've reconsidered my position: PHPBB is a thousand times better
than EZMLM. Trout you should get up on it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Termination!

Well, yeah, you need some buddies to drown sorrows with. Best to let
them go in droves for this reason.

I've been known to post novellas before, and this may be one. 

I've seen the mass forced exodus of employees before, but also on a
more personal level, my Dad was the only person in his region to get
laid off from his company (a HUGE f'ing company) recently, which was
quite an odd feeling. A feeling that made me question what I'm up to,
my future, what I'll be up to when I'm his age, and the biggest fear
in my mind, will I be subject to the same turn of events when I'm two
years from retirement.

It all didn't turn out so bad. Yet my life has been changed for ever.
He's been reassigned, and I can no longer call Cleveland my home. Yes
yes, I've been in columbus for 7 years now, but that was still HOME.
The hundreds of miles away they're going will still be home, as my
wherever my family may be is ultimately home, but I will miss
Brandywine falls, the lack of anything to really do, their back yard,
nearby family friends, extended family, my allergies to the region,
and every other pain in the ass and simultanteous love that comes with
it. Oh yeah, and my occasional spending spree in Doug's shop. Guess
it'll ALL be mail order now.

My point is that it's not the end of the world. As several more mature
list members that have recently gone the unemployed/employed cycle can
most likely attest to, it's all part of life.

I AM babbling due to some recent really shitty health issues, but yet,
it's another testament to moving on and dealing. All too often, we
rely on our jobs, socialital status, possesions... etc, as some sort
of compensation for what else is missing. It's part of why were all
part of this synthetic phile we call Pb-Cle.

I've recently been reminded of the fact that life is too short to
worry about the Bush Administration, unemployment, vinyl vs. cd vs.
finalscratch vs. traktor vs. whatever, raves vs. the scene, your fav.
genre vs. mine, or whatever the fuck trivial pursuit of the moment is.

Some of you are very close friends of mine, others aquiatnaces,
others... well, whatever you're about, there's some sort of weird
respect even though I may think you're totally off your rocker. :)

Stay well,

- Mike / aka Anonymous Informant / aka Thumplex Bumpitron / aka
wtfever I've been called through time.

PS. I'm hanging in PGH this weekend with the Silverraver and his
better half if anyone in the area feels like pancakes, fine tea, mass
quantities of beef, India Garden, some GOOD fucking beer, or a silly
ass time with my temporarily retarded ass.

PPS. Leaving here before too long, going to be in Cle for a few days,
same offer goes there.

My ER-1 and EA-1 are for sale, power supplies, and expensive hardcore
nylon carrying cases included for both, asking $200 for the pair, not
willing to part with them separately. I'm too lazy to ebay, and would
rather see them go to a good home anyway. They both have the "after
market" James Bernard (aka Expansion Union) presets in the D banks
loaded and pumping.

hey, maybe YOUR music and politics are trivial to YOU, but 
anything meaningful is worth being passionate about in my book. if 
nothing is worth living for, why be alive? i love my family as 
much as anything, but that doesnt mean that other things arent 
important as well.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} National Review marijuana article - excellent

As some of you people on the list know, I am a drug felon. It's nothing I am ashamed of, I made bad choices and took responsibility for my actions. Now that all the headache is over I figured I would try and educate myself by applying for school. Looking into the matter further it has come to my attention that as a drug offender I am not allowed to receive money from the government. If instead of dealing or manufacturing drugs I had say..... raped a little girl or even killed your mom, uncle Sam would be more than happy to give me all kinds of money. For some reason that just doesn't make sense to me. Someone told me that eventually I can get money, but it has to be like 2 or 3 years after my conviction. Anyone know more about the whole thing?

Karma has Johnny Fiasco. Pretty much every house music dj has at least =
ONE Johnny Fiasco track in their box. I don't know the price for sure, =
but I think it is $10. This will be well worth it as Doug Burkhart, Ian =
Mariano, Mike Love, Bonita DLP & Eursella, and many other local djs will =
on the decks. There is also a room of hip-hop/top-40 if your not into =
"techno" :)=20

Johnny Fiasco is a really dope dj that you should be checking out, and =
the beautiful thing is that if you are torn between Fiasco and Pete Moss =
(Headrush's event at Wish) you can catch Fiasco early because he hits =
the decks at 11pm.=20

SO... if your looking to dance to some soul shaking good music... start =
out at Karma then head over to Wish.=20

Also... Spirit of Rhythm tomorrow at Twist. Doug Burkhart, Deviant, Ian =
(from Headrush), Stout XTC, and Brandon Gill. Start time is 4:30 and =
more details will follow later on.=20

Go out this weekend... lots of good quality stuff going on!=20
=20

I thought that was all cool, till I realized you have to download

You can reapply for FAFSA after one full year, and I believe it's only
grants that ur inelligble for. Scholarships and loans don't go on that. Look
into it, because I believe if you take some remedial course and have a judge
sighn it you can be eligible beforehand. Or some jibble jabble like that.

Good luck,
Alex

More children under ten die from drowing in buckets than die from
being shot, for any reason.

My random $.02.

My pointed $.02:
The same doctors who accidentally kill people usually do so more than once.

    Pontiac goes techno

/May 12, 2004/

Movement won't be the only gathering of the techno tribes in Michigan 
this year.

Detroit-bred DJ Eddie Fowlkes is spearheading the inaugural Pontiac 
Techno House Festival, to be held July 10 and 11 outside the Phoenix 
Plaza Amphitheatre.

Fowlkes said Tuesday he's not yet ready to announce artists, but said 
three stages will host an exclusively Detroit lineup of DJs and live 
artists.

Fowlkes, part of the artist board that helped book the 2002 Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival, said he's aiming for an audience of about 
15,000.

"We're trying to grow into something like Hart Plaza," he said.

Confirmed sponsors include Pepsi, Big Boy Restaurants and Mike's Hard 
Lemonade.

The Pontiac event isn't a Movement competitor, said Fowlkes, who added 
that he's had amicable conversations with that festival's staff.

"I'm supportive of Movement, and they're supportive of what I'm doing," 
he said. "I think there's room. In Europe, you have a festival every 
weekend."

Some proceeds from the Pontiac Techno House Festival, including all 
money from a $30-per-head VIP area, will assist longtime Detroit artist 
Anthony (Shake) Shakir, who has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

That was off the top of my head people that I'd wager money on 
that had at least 1 Johnny Fiasco record in their bag of people 
that you know.

On a shitty note, I wish I knew that this was going on, I was up 
in northeast ohio for the weekend (away from this thing we call 
the internet) and by far still to this day no one has had a better 
performance that I have seen than when I saw Johnny Fiasco in 
columbus in '01.  The only person close to that was Seiji in 
columbus Feb '03.

Subject: {pb-cle} announcing Toes Digital

Toes Digital is the new sub-label of Toes in the Sand Recordings and will feature digital-only remixes of our vinyl releases.
http://www.toesrecordings.com/toesdigital.html
 
July 2004 :: TOESDIGI001-1
Michael Lanning featuring Charity Havens
"Bound for Ascension (Drew Nichols Remix)" 

**Original version featured on 'Balance 006' mixed by Anthony Pappa**

Up-and-coming Bay Area producer Drew Nichols reworks Michael Lanning's original masterpiece into a haunting, darker-edged progressive gem. Drew's stirring transformation of the original vocal layered over tribal-infused drums and airy synths takes the dance floor on a headtrip while keeping the feet moving.

The photonic activation is now waking up the miasms
in your bodies and transmutation of your pain if you
are in an environment that repels you. Hear it, let it
resonance in you. Say it: "I will Make Home Now."
  I am here to help you decode the central
intelligence of your planet, to prepare you for the
Cosmic Party that begins on winter soltice Dec. 21,
2012. You will have to prepare yourself for it, there
is no need to become a daykeeper or astrologer
yourself. Just meditate during soltices, equinoxes and
new and full moons.

Thursday, 07.08.04 ::   ALIAS @NATION + Alchemy

=8CDOUBLETHINK=B9 -- GEORGE ORWELL

In George Orwell=B9s =8C1984=B9, doublethink means the power of holding two
contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of
them. The Party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be
altered; he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality; but by
the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not
violated. The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out
with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would
bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt (of which the current
administration has none).

Not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject
can be tolerated (one will be considered un-American). But it is also
necessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner. And if it
is necessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper with written records
(Bush=B9s military documents), then it is necessary to forget that one has
done so.

The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with War;
The Ministry of Truth with Lies;
The Ministry of Love with Torture;
The Ministry of Plenty with Starvation.

In =8CFahrenheit 9/11=B9 Michael Moore quotes Orwell, =B3It's not a matter of
whether the war (against terror) is not real, or if it is. Victory is not
possible. The war is not meant to be won, it is meant to be continuous.
Hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance=
.
This new version is the past and no different past can ever have existed. I=
n
principle the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of
starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects,
and its object is not the victory over either Eurasia (Iraq) or East Asia
(al Qaeda) but to keep the very structure of society intact.=B2

There just doesnt seem to be enough interest this year for the

later this year here in pittsburgh.  Something a little more toned 
down from drunken house party debauchery.  I will keep all of you 
posted on when and where the party in the park will be.

Hawtin's set was good but short (just over 2 hours). I couldn't believe
he dropped an instrumental remix of Bill Jean and I liked it:-) The
turnout could have been better. I heard he played 4 hours in Detroit was
anyone there? 
 
Oh and Magda rocked!

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Pictures from Hawtin in Col

Yeah in louisville he must have played for about 3 or 4 hours.  He had some 
flubs but for the most part it was a ROCKIN' set.  He also played acid 
tracks from a lil coaxing from me, my friend chad and jason clark aka 
strangeloop.  :-)  Magda is always the best and she's hot too.  :)   I 
totally feel "glitch hop" and minimal techno, which is hated on where I 
live, unfortuneately.  I am glad I didn't have to drive 1763297213927897 
hours to hear some quality bleep bloop and gzork beats in the hizzy.

I can bet richie and magda brought the bag and filled it with tricks for 
detroit.  Thats their semi-hometown.

Fo shizzle,
steve

Subject: {pb-cle} Multimedia in Cleveland July 17th

Our third multimedia event in the Modern Midwest series will be 
Saturday July 17th, 2004 starting at 11:00pm and running late...

The title of the event is "Focus Forward".  In the Modern Midwest we 
will find order within the disorder and opportunities from 
possibilities.

The location is Orthodox Cleveland - 6205 Detroit Avenue.

The ticket price is $5 with a picture related to the theme (see the 
website) or $7 without.

Oozitron from the prairies of Indiana will perform an improvised set 
of live electronic music.

Bable Fish translates the meaning of Oozitron:

"Destruction intensity doing from the non existence synth scene of 
north east Indiana, Oozitron analog and digital synths, is the step 
sequencer and merger of the effect. Liking the improvisation which 
has lived in order to draw up the track of beauty of the skull 
vibration in boring preparation, Oozitron always connects timbres of 
synth of transfer with twistingly repetitive pattern and the 
percussion instrument."

Oozitron will play hardware sequencers, drum machines, synthesizers, 
effects, and be accompanied by a percussionist.

Backing up Oozitron will be Ramzi (live by way of computer and dub 
effects) and Optomas closing the night with a Techno dj mix.

Other djs and performers will be announced.

Surf to http://www.ramzisrareaudiovisualexperience.net for full 
details and an mp3 mix of Oozitron.

We hope you can make it!

Jassen Ramzi Tawil

Ecliptic-Trance Presents:
Chapter IV - The Doors Of Perception- 08.13.2004

Flyer Link: http://www.ecliptic-trance.com/ChapterIV.htm

@ "Club Exit" Brooklyn, NYC.
Doors Open at: 11PM-8AM Club Hotline: 718-349-6969

Line Up:

Psysex - Live - (HOM-mega Productions - ISRAEL)
Udi Shternberg aka Dj Goblin and Yoni Oshrat aka Schatsi are a household
name and
are one of the most unique sounding groups, never conforming to formula and
reinventing their sound with every release. Now working on a "Psysex
Remixes" album,
due out in the fall after already releasing 3 full albums. Influenced by
their love
to sci-fi, they promise to come in peace and leave you in pieces.

Rinkadink - Live - (Alchemy Records, Nano Records, Afrogalactic - SOUTH
AFRICA)
Vana Van Jaarsveld, the king of South African crunch, continues the
invasion of the
new sounds into our scene. Blending humor, industrial sounds and funk an
animated
journey is expected. After releasing his debut album 'Rabbit From
Darkside' Vana is
ready to get his floss on and snack on New York.

DJ Karan Bhoj - (Third Eye Records - INDIA)
Representing Boombay with a rabid case of mind bending sounds, this top
Indian dj
will transform your mind and entrance you in a captivating set. Playing
new music
from his compilation "Evolution" - mayhem is assured.

KRI -(T.O.U.C.H. Samadhi- ASHVILLE)
Kri is the dj who never ceases to amaze with his ability to tap into the
moment and
play exactly what is right. Right, that is, if you like your Trance tracks
like a
tidal wave, like a werewolves' howl, like a sandblaster busting open your
third eye.


Special Fluro Psychedelic trance environment by:

Analogia aka Phoenix Designs
Andre's harmony through pattern situates him on top in the decoration
department.
Creating a vehicle to the mind's journey through deceivingly simple yet
wonderously
complex creations. He creates environments
that put one's place in the universe in perspective, another strand in the
fractal
weave of life.

The Devotee (T.O.U.C.H. Samadhi, Asheville) - Shane's psy-optic mind
stimuli are
known across the US. He is able to breath life into his artwork in a
spiritual
manner only a few can understand without witnessing his work in action.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 5

STEVE GERRARD (Bedrock/Wrecked Angle / Filta)

"Steve Gerrard is another DJ who is making a name for himself by
delivering great sets everywhere he goes. He always rocks it at Bedrock
when he plays." -- John Digweed 

Chris from Hybrid said in Muzik magazine, "Steve is one of the best up
and coming DJs I've heard in a long time. He has very similar tunes in
his box to me, actually - deep, progressive tracks that aren't too
shiny! I walked into a club recently and he was playing most of the
stuff I was going to play... God knows where he gets all those tunes!"

In 1998, Steve won Muzik Magazine's Bedroom Bedlam competition, and 2
years later won the Ericsson Award for Best Bedroom Bedlam DJ. Since
then his career has gone from strength to strength. With influences that
range from Sasha and Digweed, Nick Warren and Danny Howells to Adam
Freeland and Hybrid and the technical skills of Anthony Pappa, he has
developed a unique style, which is: deep, progressive house mixed with
breakbeat, building steadily and creating a set which is more than the
sum of its parts. All the while keeping in mind that it is his job to
make people want to dance and keep on dancing.

Dj Nitro is back for an encore.

 

DJ Nitro has quickly become one of the rising stars of the Midwest. 
Starting out at after-hours parties in St. Louis, Nitro built his 
following from the ground up.  He has played at shows across America from 
San Francisco to Detroit and all points in between. In 1999, he broke the 
international barrier, playing Toronto. Nitro calls his style Disco-Tech. 
"Most house music", Nitro remarks, "doesn’t usually have enough energy to 
move a crowd at peak hour - But when you give 'em something hard mixed 
with something funky, the people on the floor can't help but dance."

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 6

TY TEK (Phrunky, Casa Del Soul, Dirty Blue, Movim)
www.djtytek.com

Ty’s been playing records for eight years and producing for six. Born
and raised in Pueblo, CO. Brought up on a healthy diet of bands such as
TKK, Skinny Puppy, Coil, and Nitzer Ebb, Ty knew that music was the
career of his future. Self taught and eager to play, Ty found his first
residency at Evolution Night Club (Pueblo, CO, 1994-1996), with a four
night per week schedule. Ty moved to Denver, CO in 1997 for a Film/Video
Production degree. In this time, Ty met Koa Franconi (Superstar
Productions/ DJ Keoki’s brother) and started one of the longest Thursday
club/dance nights in Denver’s history. With crowds reaching 1500+ a
night, Ty was able to spread his musical message to the masses. Tracks
2000 closed it's doors in 2001, but this was far from the end. Factory
Of Dreams Night Club has taken it's place with the same old school feel
the original Tracks 2000 was notorious for. Check out
www.factoryofdreams.com 

Ty met Jason and Brad of Together Productions and started a new night to
fill the place of Tracks 2000’s hiatus. Vinyl Night Club
(www.1082broadway.com) is one of Denver’s premier hot spots, with
National and International talent showcased on a weekly basis. Ty began
his Saturday night residency here and has been able to play alongside
some of the worlds best DJ’s. ( Richie Hawtin, Derrick May, Carl Cox,
Fat Boy Slim, Pete Tong, Derrick Carter, Saeed & Palash, Deep Dish, DJ
Dan, Moby, Donald Glaude, and many more of the same caliber).  Ty also
has found a residency every other Saturday at the world-renowned Denver
club, The Church. Some of the biggest names in electronic music have
made their way through this magnificent club. Check out
www.the-church.com . Ty's style ranges from funky tech-house to tribal
to progressive. His style is geared towards the room being played.

Alongside label partner Little Mike, Ty runs his own record label, which
is already gaining momentum and receiving acclaim from the worlds top
DJ’s and producers. Check out www.phrunky.com for all info regarding
this label. In 1999 Ty joined Casa Del Soul. This group of DJ's: Sensé,
Catt, Foxx, Little Mike, and Wyatt Earp, are friends; co-workers within
the Casa Del Soul Record Label and the leading choice of talent in
Colorado. Their main focus is to push innovative music to their
listeners. Casa Del Soul Records has received critical acclaim by
DJ’s/Producers from all over the world with releases from Ty Tek &
Little Mike "Casafied Modern Music 2" featured on Lee Burridge’s
Nu-Breed mix compilation. Other Casa releases have found homes on
compilations from Lexicon Avenue, Doc Martin (Fabric 10) and was on
Muzik magazine’s list of top tech-house recommened labels of 2002.

The title of the event is "Focus Forward".  In the Modern Midwest we 
will find order within the disorder and opportunities from 
possibilities.

The location is Orthodox Cleveland - 6205 Detroit Avenue.

Oozitron from the prairies of Indiana will perform an improvised set of 
live electronic music.

Bable Fish translates the meaning of Oozitron:

"Destruction intensity doing from the non existence synth scene of north 
east Indiana, Oozitron analog and digital synths, is the step sequencer 
and merger of the effect. Liking the improvisation which has lived in 
order to draw up the track of beauty of the skull vibration in boring 
preparation, Oozitron always connects timbres of synth of transfer with 
twistingly repetitive pattern and the percussion instrument."

Oozitron will play hardware sequencers, drum machines, synthesizers, 
effects, and be accompanied by a percussionist.

Backing up Oozitron will be Ramzi (live by way of computer and dub 
effects) and Optomas closing the night with a Techno dj mix.

Other djs and performers will be announced.

Surf to http://www.ramzisrareaudiovisualexperience.net for full details 
and an mp3 mix of Oozitron.

Jul 16-18                         TEKNIVAL                     Toronto area

Calling all Soundsystems! 

The Toronto Freetekno community will be collaborating once again to 
generate a 2004 teknival. From July 16 to 18 a quiet patch of Ontario 
crown land will become a temporary musical playground for anyone and 
everyone with ears. The event will of course be 100% free. People can show 
up as early as they'd like (some crews may be showing up as early as july 
9) and stay as long as they'd like, until the last partier hits the 
ground. 

ANY and ALL Soundsystems are invited to come set up camp and Jam along 
side the bizarre collection of deranged Torontonians that has come to be 
known as freeteknotoronto. Even if you've never thrown a jam before, feel 
free to get a crew together and set up a stage. You've got the knowlege of 
some seasoned veterans to draw from. Last year we were lucky to be joined 
by collectives from across Ontario, from Quebec and from New York. This 
year promises to be bigger, harder, ect. ect. 

A release of pre-flyers will be circulating in Toronto by mid March. 
We would like an idea of how many stages will be represented this year, so 
if you plan on coming and would like to be included please contact us with 
a YES/NO/MAYBE by the first week in March. More informative flyers should 
hit the street by June 1. If you would like a write-up to appear in these 
flyers, please let us know. 

Also feel free to design your own teknival flyer or web graphic to 
send around to your crew/city/whatever. There's already 3 collectives in 
toronto working on separate designs, reps from other cities are ideal. 
Teknival is a decentralized non-hierarchical event meaning no one person 
or system plans it. It also means that if someone doesn't make it happen, 
it won't. Take it into your own hands and make this event the event you 
want it to be. 

Teknival Sound System Email List: 
If you'd like to be in the loop on the planning process and have your 
say or whatever just email this address and recieve all the communique's 
between systems.

Saturday, July 24 at Abbasso

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 7

TRENDROID (Transport 6, Kinetic, Renaissance, NYC)
feat. Matt Edwards

For Pankaj & Matt Edwards (aka Trendroid/Brick City/PM Player) it’s 
been a dizzying climb up the dance music ranks. It was only four years 
ago that the legendary NYC club Twilo signed them as the debut artists 
for their new label. And it's only gotten better for them on the 
international scene. Trendroid's unique and futuristic style of house 
music is frequently described as “the sound of the UK with the attitude 
and energy of NYC.”

The duo met as first year medical students where they discovered their 
similar taste in music, influenced by the local scene in New York City 
in the 1990's. It was an era of creativity, color and eclecticism. The 
days of NASA, Disco 2000, and Club USA left a strong imprint on them, 
and they took away from that culture a respect for diversity and forward 
thinking.

Drawing from these and other influences, they soon got into the studio 
and wrote their first tracks, "Ignition" and "Hausjam". Twilo used this 
record as their debut single, and things started snowballing from there. 

Pankaj & Matt’s demand as DJs steadily grew, but it was after Kinetic 
Records chose Trendroid to mix Transport 6 that they became the newest 
players on the international scene of headlining djs.

Later, original tracks like “Trendication” on Twisted, “4 Corners” 
on FUJU, and the recently released “Rastafari” on Renaissance becoming 
landmark tracks. X-press 2 recently asked Trendroid to remix their 
classic song “Smoke Machine” for Skint Records.

Other remixes have included Superchumbo’s “Revolution”, Murk’s 
“Dark Beat”, and artists as diverse as Jam & Spoon to pop star Mandy 
Moore. Their tracks have been licensed to the prestigious Cream and 
Global Underground compilations, among others. It did not take long for 
their skills to be noticed by top DJ's of all genres, including Deep 
Dish, Steve Lawler, and Junior Sanchez. 

Whether its underground club tracks or filtered vocal projects, 2004 
will demonstrate even further their broad take on house music. Upcoming 
releases and collaborations will be with Roger Sanchez and Stealth 
Records. And perhaps their most far reaching & exciting work thus far, 
“Rumba Magic” (done under the Brick City alias) caused a massive stir 
at the 2004 WMC. With multiple Radio 1 plays, confirmed top 20 hype 
chart placement, and huge support from Carl Cox, Darren Emerson, and 
dozens of others, it is the type of latin house bomb that cuts through 
genre barriers and reflects their continued commitment to diversity.

Fri Jul 30                      THIRD EYE V6                      Cleveland

Friday July 30      Cleveland, Ohio

Goahead presents The Third Eye V.6
featuring a full psytrance lineup with
our friends from Chicago and New York

S.O.T. (Synchronous Oscillation Technology)
T.O.U.C.H. Samadhi - Chicago

S.O.T(Igor) was transplanted from across the ocean nine years ago with
hopes to learn about this side of the world. At the end of his mission,
the Mothership came to take him back, however alien frequencies of
psychedelic trance lured him in and changed these plans. Based in Chicago,
he began playing/producing with one goal in mind "...to see more people go
ape-shit on a dance floor!.. loose themselves and get reborn.." Igor is
extending the T.O.U.C.H Samadhi healing energy to the Midwest; using
soaring leads and swinging basslines that are sure to keep you
"oscillating" well into the night.

http://synchronous.home.comcast.net/html/slide2.html

Dan Efex - Chicago
Dan Efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out
of even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed
shoulder to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an
energetic and intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who
consider him to be one of the founders of the Midwest’s trance scene, a
scene that is still strong and growing today. He was one of the first to
introduce the Midwest to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions
characteristic of some of his styles of trance. But although Dan is
perhaps best known for his trance, do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as
he is skilled! His repertoire of past events includes sets with
progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard techno, hard core, hard
house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it up and keeps it
interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and know precisely
what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind on his musical
excursions.

Ari D - New York/Russia - Goahead's NYC connection,
Ari has wide knowledge of the psytrance genre and that is evident in his
dj sets. Ari has been DJing since 1996, got hooked on psytrance in 2001.
Over the years Ari's sets have progressed to accent diversity of track
selection and variety of mixing techniques. Expect to get a proper taste
of psytekk,
progressive and full-on, all in a building blend of positive dancefloor
energy to get your smile & groove on.

Malachi - Goahead - Akron/Cleveland
Getting things started early.

ARTIST BIO ::

Music has always been a big part of Dennis Rodgers life. Always one to 
actively collect whatever sort of music he was feeling at the moment, it 
wasn't until he reluctantly fell upon house music 4 years ago when it 
took over. During the next few years he developed his sound out of the 
now notorious after hour sessions with the rest of the 112 Crew (Bill 
Patrick, Matt Licata and Tom Amoroso).

It is from these sessions where his talent was discovered and the 
bookings began to roll in. Dennis has come up quickly in NYC playing 
along side DJs such as Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, James Zabiela, 
Funk D'Void, Grant Dell, Casa del sol, Jay Tripwire and more. Dennis and 
the 112 crew held a prestigious residency at Arc NYC until its recent 
closing, and are current residents at Fluid in Philadelphia.

Taking influences from DJs such as Tenaglia, Terry Francis, and Ritchie 
Hawtin. Dennis values these influences but strives to push the sound 
forward "I find no reason in recycling what has been done" he says "I 
constantly try to find new music to keep myself interested and therefore 
the crowd." With a respect for the venue and the vibe of the night 
always evident, he finds a way to direct his sounds at the head but move 
the hips. The ability to find completely unique, techy, quirky, deep 
house and techno has become his trademark.

Dennis recently turned his attention to production joining partners 
Hisham Samawi and Brendan Benke as The Dirty Gringos. Their first 
project "Cowbell" has been instantly successful. It's been played by 
Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, Lee Buridge and recently gained the #2 
spot in URB Magazine for Best new track of the WMC 2003.

On the heels of all of this success Dennis looks forward to the future. 
"Everything seems to be falling into place." The music has become a part 
of him and he looks forward to sharing it with who ever will listen.

Goahead productions continues The Third Eye ritual. Don’t
miss this soulful experience as we get deep into the roots!


Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

We are pleased to welcome our friends from berettamusic in Detriot

Sundays                        SUNDAY WEEKLIES                   Where ever


cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------


BACKLASH
Sundays
at the CHURCH

ELECTRO - SYNTH-POP - ALTERNATIVE - CONNIE FUNK
INDUSTRIAL - NO WAVE - ANTI RAVE

and, yes....a bit of house and techno.

The simple premise of this latest incarnation of THE CHURCH is to provide 
a venue for the new electro-alternative sounds that are being, for the 
most part, ignored by Cleveland club nights and parties.

A mash-up of 20 years of musical sub-genres, the sound is as much familiar 
as it is foreign.

Resident DJs are Rob Sherwood, Briri, and Alex Holt. We are also actively 
seeking new, like-minded DJs to add to our line-up. Interested DJs should 
email ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net.

ALL ARE WELCOME, but if you do come to check us out, PLEASE don't come 
expecting The Church of yesteryear. We are re-building Sunday nights 2 
people at a time, and have a long, long way to go.

18 and over - doors at 10pm - FREE ADMISSION before 11pm - $5.00 after

We are trying to put together an email promotion list, so anyone mailing 
us at ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net before Sunday will be placed on the 
guest list for free admission for 2 people on Sunday 18th, April

Hope to see everyone this Sunday

For the party people who refuse to stop at 2am,

The Shadow Lounge hosts a weekly Friday night
afterhours dance party from 2am-5am. If anyone's down
for some latenight dancing to good soulful music (deep
house, nu jazz, funk) come on down for the party. The
vibe is relaxed and intimate. Some couches if you wish
to chill with a brew but the past few weeks have been
folks on the floor bumping 'n' hustling. Last time I
was there, people were on the tables, the bar
counters, shaking bootay, even breakdancing - a real
dance party a la NYC's Body & Soul or Paradise Garage.
Yours truly occasionally appears on the turntables as
does my DJ crew (Technoir Audio) alongside residents
DJ John Ep & Brother Mike. I'll be bringing some funky
disco records tonight, so if anyone wants to stomp
until sunrise....

stuff as well as a COLORING CONTEST!!!!!!!  contestants will have their 
works hung as part of the exhibit and prizes will be awarded.  cleveland 
noise knob-tweekers Thursday Club will have soundscapes carving out the 
basement walls.  lotsa wine and cheese too, ya know!  ch ch ch ch check it

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR-PSA $ for college

for those interested,
Employees of the Home Depot are eligible to receive 50% of their college 
tuition + books reimbursed to them if they fall under certain criteria.
#1 you major must be somehow Home Depot business related... examples are 
Interior Design, Logistics, Accounting, Marketing, Aeronautics (HD has their 
own planes), + MANY more.
#2  you must earn at least a 'C' in a class in order to receive 
reimbursement for that class.

there are a few more stipulations, email me if you have questions. and no 
you dont have to work for HD for any specific amount of time after you 
graduate. I just figured some people on this list might benefit from this 
post.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ken lay indicted

Anymore minimum security prisons are a cakewalk, aspecially federal ones. They are referred to as "club fed". Some federal white collar criminals have access to a pool, tennis courts, racquetball, basketball, ect. Plus if they are married they can have "special visits" with their wives. I am sure there is gay sex going on but its probobly mutual, not forced. Now, in prisons with violent offenders, rapests, ect, that kind of shit happens all the time, but those are going to be mostly maximum security joints.

Subject: {pb-cle} worst piece of journalism EVER - from Wooster, OH

Okay, the thing that's even more scary than the content is the date of
its publication...Two weeks ago!!!! Are people still in the dark ages
about this stuff??? Write the author, write the editor, write the owner
of this rag...This is absurd. Saying that a DJ gets paid $25,000 a night
to play at a rave so people can date-rape each other is the most
over-the-top thing I've ever read...And yes, that's right folks...This
is a newspaper just 1 hour south of Cleveland, in the county where
"Field Day" was held last year.

RAVES A HAVEN FOR PREDATORS 

Does your child rave? I don't mean about music, movie idols or romantic
interests.  I don't mean rant and rave.  I mean does your child drug
rave? What is a rave? A rave is a gathering of young people to drink and
do drugs.  The sole purpose is to get high.  This is not just a
boys-will-be-boys and girls-will-be-girls situation.  This is not
experimental alcohol and/or marijuana use. 

This is hard-core use.  And the problem is - many are victimized by
sexual predators at raves and a significant number die from the drugs. 

Raves usually are held in abandoned buildings - warehouses in the city
or barns in the country.  Sometimes they are even rented for the
occasion.  Some are very sophisticated, with DJs imported from out of
town using elaborate sound and light systems.  These are usually
promoted by people from other areas of the country.  This is how they
make a living.  Some DJs at the larger raves get as much as $25,000 a
night.  They have sound and light systems set up to intentionally
overload the brain's receptors.  Then the high from the drugs is more
intense.  The type of music played is called "trance music." These
people have researched this very carefully.  They are not stupid.  They
are, however, criminal. 

Some raves are simply a local group using a home sound system.  They get
the word out about the meeting time and place.  Then they share whatever
drugs everyone has communally.  Problem here is, where did the drugs
come from? Have they been altered? 

How do they get the word out? Obviously they can't take out an ad in the
local media that says "DRUGS and BOOZE." However, there are ways.  Have
you ever seen an oval sign or sticker that has ONE on it? Look closely.
If the O and N are slightly smaller than the E, to the knowledgeable
this reads "on Ecstasy." Ecstasy is a date rape drug.  This means a rave
is going to happen.  Sometimes around colleges and high schools this
will appear on fliers with a date below.  Then you simply have to start
asking and the location is found.  Who would you ask? Trust me, your
child knows who the serious druggies are in their school.  It's
frighteningly easy. 

What kind of drugs are available at a rave? Just about everything in the
physician's desk reference, plus a few homemade drugs.  Think that it
would take a laboratory in someone's house to make drugs? Think again.
At a recent conference I attended I found out some of the popular date
rape drugs are made from non-medicinal items found in most homes. 

I am not going to tell you what the ingredients are because I am not
into spreading this information to those who don't already know.  But I
will tell you homemade drugs have the same problem as bathtub gin during
Prohibition - - sometimes they blind, sometimes they cause brain damage,
sometimes they kill. 

I mentioned predators attending these events.  A famous bank robber was
once asked why he robbed banks.  He answered "because that's where the
money is." Sexual predators attend these events because that's where
their potential victims are.  There is even a classification for this
type of assault.  It's called drug facilitated sexual assault ( DFSA ).
It is defined by the use of an "anesthesia-type" drug to make the victim
incapacitated to the point where they are incapable of consenting or not
consenting to sex. 

Very often the victim will lose consciousness, awake in a different
location and feel like they had sex, but not remember it.  There is
often no physical trauma because there was no struggle.  Nonetheless, if
consent was not given, it was an assault. 

How is this handled in law? The Ohio Revised Code states evidence that,
at the time of the alleged violation, the victim lacked the capacity to
give consent is admissible to show the victim did not give consent.  In
other words, not saying no doesn't mean yes. 

In America sexual assaults occur 78 times an hour - 1,871 times a day.
A growing number of these are drug facilitated sexual assaults.  Drug
facilitated sexual assaults are one of the leading causes that rapes of
males is on the rise. 

What is a typical scenario that allows this to happen? A young person 15
to 25 at a private party, bar or club is given drink they didn't order
and didn't see poured or their drink was left unattended.  After
drinking the beverage they have a very sudden onset of nausea and go to
the bathroom.  When they come out a "helpful" individual - sometimes a
known person, sometimes a stranger - offers to help them go outside for
fresh air or offers a ride home.  The victim wakes up one to 12 hours
later in a remote location.  The victim may have no memory or may have
"flashes" of the assault. 

Want to make the point with your child about unattended drinks? Drop a
dry bean or dry macaroni piece in their can of pop when they aren't
paying attention.  When they find it at the bottom of the drink remind
them it only takes a second for someone to alter their drink.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: seeking female roommate in Pittsburgh

Hi.  I don't usually post because most of you are from Cleveland or other
OH spots, but I know some Pittsburgh people lurk around here somewheres.

I'm seeking a female roommate to move in to my wonderful, spacious, cheap
apartment in the Squirrel Hill-Greenfield area of Pittsburgh.  A link to
my craigslist ad with all the details is below.  Spread the word to anyone
you know who might be looking for a place starting in August or Sept. 
Thanks!

"trance music" eh?  usually it's just described as electronically

what raves have you been going to?

not necessarily a rave, but doormouse's barn parties were 
legendary, ask traat, he went to one with us.

dont ask me. i think kids had too much time and money on their 
hands. $5 hit of acid will last you like 6-8 hours. those cats 
would pay $20 to get in and $20 for their pill of e. waste of 
money if you ask me. 

>wow, that whole book.  that must mean they have suppositories and

i once had a guy try to sell me quaaludes at a rave. according to 
him, they were buried somewhere by a hippie guy he knew, and he 
dug them up and was selling them. 

>Sounds to me this is another beacon journal "drug users wear

no really, drug users wear visors with those plastic stars on 
them. my word is my bond.

RAVES A HAVEN FOR PREDATORS 

Does your child rave? I don't mean about music, movie idols or romantic
interests. I don't mean rant and rave. I mean does your child drug
rave? What is a rave? A rave is a gathering of young people to drink and
do drugs. The sole purpose is to get high. This is not just a
boys-will-be-boys and girls-will-be-girls situation. This is not
experimental alcohol and/or marijuana use. 

This is hard-core use. And the problem is - many are victimized by
sexual predators at raves and a significant number die from the drugs. 

Raves usually are held in abandoned buildings - warehouses in the city
or barns in the country. Sometimes they are even rented for the
occasion. Some are very sophisticated, with DJs imported from out of
town using elaborate sound and light systems. These are usually
promoted by people from other areas of the country. This is how they
make a living. Some DJs at the larger raves get as much as $25,000 a
night. They have sound and light systems set up to intentionally
overload the brain's receptors. Then the high from the drugs is more
intense. The type of music played is called "trance music." These
people have researched this very carefully. They are not stupid. They
are, however, criminal. 

Some raves are simply a local group using a home sound system. They get
the word out about the meeting time and place. Then they share whatever
drugs everyone has communally. Problem here is, where did the drugs
come from? Have they been altered? 

How do they get the word out? Obviously they can't take out an ad in the
local media that says "DRUGS and BOOZE." However, there are ways. Have
you ever seen an oval sign or sticker that has ONE on it? Look closely.
If the O and N are slightly smaller than the E, to the knowledgeable
this reads "on Ecstasy." Ecstasy is a date rape drug. This means a rave
is going to happen. Sometimes around colleges and high schools this
will appear on fliers with a date below. Then you simply have to start
asking and the location is found. Who would you ask? Trust me, your
child knows who the serious druggies are in their school. It's
frighteningly easy. 

What kind of drugs are available at a rave? Just about everything in the
physician's desk reference, plus a few homemade drugs. Think that it
would take a laboratory in someone's house to make drugs? Think again.
At a recent conference I attended I found out some of the popular date
rape drugs are made from non-medicinal items found in most homes. 

I am not going to tell you what the ingredients are because I am not
into spreading this information to those who don't already know. But I
will tell you homemade drugs have the same problem as bathtub gin during
Prohibition - - sometimes they blind, sometimes they cause brain damage,
sometimes they kill. 

I mentioned predators attending these events. A famous bank robber was
once asked why he robbed banks. He answered "because that's where the
money is." Sexual predators attend these events because that's where
their potential victims are. There is even a classification for this
type of assault. It's called drug facilitated sexual assault ( DFSA ).
It is defined by the use of an "anesthesia-type" drug to make the victim
incapacitated to the point where they are incapable of consenting or not
consenting to sex. 

Very often the victim will lose consciousness, awake in a different
location and feel like they had sex, but not remember it. There is
often no physical trauma because there was no struggle. Nonetheless, if
consent was not given, it was an assault. 

How is this handled in law? The Ohio Revised Code states evidence that,
at the time of the alleged violation, the victim lacked the capacity to
give consent is admissible to show the victim did not give consent. In
other words, not saying no doesn't mean yes. 

In America sexual assaults occur 78 times an hour - 1,871 times a day.
A growing number of these are drug facilitated sexual assaults. Drug
facilitated sexual assaults are one of the leading causes that rapes of
males is on the rise. 

What is a typical scenario that allows this to happen? A young person 15
to 25 at a private party, bar or club is given drink they didn't order
and didn't see poured or their drink was left unattended. After
drinking the beverage they have a very sudden onset of nausea and go to
the bathroom. When they come out a "helpful" individual - sometimes a
known person, sometimes a stranger - offers to help them go outside for
fresh air or offers a ride home. The victim wakes up one to 12 hours
later in a remote location. The victim may have no memory or may have
"flashes" of the assault. 

Want to make the point with your child about unattended drinks? Drop a
dry bean or dry macaroni piece in their can of pop when they aren't
paying attention. When they find it at the bottom of the drink remind
them it only takes a second for someone to alter their drink.

Wow, I dont even know where to begin on this.  My points and arguements may seem kind of speratic because Im so completly disgusted by this absurd piece of trash you call an article.  First things first, Im not a "drug addicted", "drug selling", "Sexual Predator".  I own my own production company.  We put on heavy metal shows, but my WIFE and I enjoy techno music (or as your obviously uninfored self put it "trance") and attend a few local "raves" every year.  I put up awsome light displays and huge sound systems at my shows not so people can do drugs and rape each other, but because it makes the shows more memorable and just more fun in general.  I thank my "rave" background for a lot of my production knowledge. Next, I used to live in Oakland CA.  I was a small time DJ there and trust me I nor any friend of mine made anywhere near $25,000 a night. It was usually more like $25-$250 a night.  Sometimes it was free because its what I like to do.  These parties in Oakland would happen
 almost every night and would include 1,000's to 10,000s of people and rarely did I hear of anyone being hurt, raped, or dying.  These points hold even more truth in this Ohio area.  HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO A "RAVE" ? NO. I been to parties where thers more cops and security then people dancing.  Oh and good luck trying to throw a rave in a warehouse or abondoned building, that will probably last for about five minutes.  Then the cops will be ther to arrest everyone.  As far a making drugs goes you did not list anything because you dont know a damn thing about it.  Last time I checked (and Im no expert) the only drug made from household goods is GHB, which you dont even mention in your sad little article.  You should check out a book called MDMA its by a DOCTOR but Im not sure of the name because Im not in my library and Im to pissed to stop typing and check.  Im not some crazy idiot that thinks nothing bad ever happens at rave, some people do drugs, some people have sex, but go to any
 concert and youll see the same thing.  Im not proud to say I even see thes things happening at my shows, but that shouldn't ruin it for the people that are just there to have a good time.  Your article is uniformed bullshit propaganda and you should be fired for writing such garbage.
 
So on behalf of all local promoters, Techno, Metal, Hippie, or other I invite you to GO FUCK YOURSELF!!!
 
P.S. I would like a reply to this, but I suggest you do a lot more research than you did for this article before you do.

I HIGHLY recommend his IDJ promo that came out a couple years ago if

top-notch.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Stupidity at it finest

I also sent this not so combative email:

Did you write this?  Their are people who do enjoy listening to electronic
music without drug use.  We tend to stay at home these days because the
"scene" as its put is full of impressionable young consumers and NOT the
forward thinking independent minded people of years gone by.  It's
convenient for society to point a finger at a underground culture and say
this is the problem.

What people don't want to hear is that because they work 50 to 60 hours a
week and spend no time teaching and raising their children they don't turn
out in a fashion that they thought they should.  Bad parenting is so much
easier to pawn off on something like "raves".  I'm sure most of your readers
just get bombarded with the exact same material "raves are bad"  and this
makes them feel better about their own shortcomings as parents.

straight.  Firstly, as an attendee of raves I have never seen or heard =
of any young ladies being raped because they were on ecstasy.  Secondly, =
unfortunately there are members of society that feel they need drugs to =
have fun, and yes they do come to raves, but guess what else, they are =
at rock shows, polka dances, square dances, and just about anyplace else =
large numbers of people congregate and music is played loudly. Saying =
all raves are dens of drug use is horribly inaccurate and biased.  Also, =
most raves are alcohol free, except the events that happen at 21+ clubs. =
 In fact the only drink you can usually get at a rave is bottled water.  =
I don't about Ms. Theil, but most people I know that drink bottled water =
put the cap on after they take a sip making it very hard to slip in some =
evil potion.  Even further to that point, at most raves there isn't even =
a bar to set your bottled water on, so most people pocket their water or =
put in a bag/purse.

Ms. Theil's views on raves are those of someone who has never been to a =
rave, and only gotten their information from the DEA's website and news =
reports on television.  Shame on her and same on your for putting such a =
skewed piece of fiction in your newspaper.

in 1998, becoming the first American to release psychedelic trance on an 
international label, with the track "People of Earth" on Boom Records 
(Holland). A full-length album, "Fluorolizard," followed in 1999. During 
this time, while also attending medical school, Kent began working with 
Hugh Sharpe on their project Shape Shifters, releasing on Krembo Records 
(Israel) and playing live across North America (including two Pittsburgh 
appearances at Sidetrakkt events). Kent has been instrumental in the 
formation of U.S.-based Soular Records, where his most recent releases 
can be found, including collaborations with Deeper In Zen. In addition, 
Kent is a member of the three-piece psytrance outfit Doppler Attack. We 
are honored to welcome back Kent as he makes his first Pittsburgh 
appearance as Mind Warped, where his music will certainly live up to its 
name!

DOPPLER ATTACK - performing LIVE
(Konvocation - Baltimore, MD)

www.konvocation.com/?s=doppler

A new type of electronic musical act, Doppler Attack is comprised of a 
DJ (Cyzum), a drummer (Mhatra, aka K. Cornelius) and a synth wizard 
(Mind Warped). Cyzum lays the beats, while Mhatra plays tribal 
percussion over top, and Mind Warped filters everything through effects, 
drops samples in realtime and mixes synth leads over the main mix. 
Doppler Attack pioneers a completely new type of musical performance, 
"real time remixing". We are excited to welcome them for their first 
Pittsburgh appearance!

later this year here in pittsburgh.  Something a little more toned 
down from drunken house party debauchery.  I will keep all of you

Oh well... it was fun while it lasted I guess...

{{ trout <trout@pornstarstyle.com> }
no dice, i hate bboards.  how often am i on ravetrash?  never.  i always
forget to go there.  mailing lists come right to me and i don't have to do
anything other than hit delete 800 times a day. }}

My point exactly. Not having to delete stuff is cool. Plus it's on someone
else's server taking up space not on my machine locally.

You're just analog. Delete.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} who else thinks this is an amazing lineup?

i'd go there just to see luke vibert.  find the kerrier district
album if you haven't heard it already.  and the newer downtempo
version (pretty much) on ninja tune recently released - sorry i made 
you lush.  spectacular, both.  

i had the best time at electrowerkz last year right
after new years.  i was by myself, in this deserted 
neighborhood outside of london, looking for the place.
it turned out to be this hole in the wall warehouse with
this sound system that i felt until i fell asleep the next morning.
rowdy fun crowd - souljazz with andy weatherall and
a bunch of others .. i had no idea who.  that building was
literally swaying back and forth - insane good party.

luke vibert is the man

maybe 5 years ago it would have been interesting. bizzy b and 
remarc's new stuff is okay, but not the bomb. u-ziq and jega have 
both been pretty garbage for a long time. and vsnares was much 
much more interesting in 99. eh. id rather be at today's day of 
the pontiac techno and house fest.

nah, i'm a lazy bitch, its too much work to GO to the board, PICK which 
of the 3 subboards to go to, then click click click and go thru the 
different threads.  let us not forget the fucktarded HUGE pictures in 
everyone sigs. (thank gawd for adblock)....  just too damn much work.  a 
mailing list?  it comes in, gets sorted server side and dropped in the 
right folder.  and i use IMAP, so it isn't taking up space locally.  i'm 
only using 200 megs on my server for email.   hell gmail is gonna offer 
up a gig.   one divx takes 6-700 megs.  space isn't an issue for me.  
get a bigger drive el cheapo!

Subject: {pb-cle} www.basslinemagazine.com/forum is up now!

Hey everyone!
We finally have a part of our Web site up! It's been a
long process with some developer changes taking place,
but we do finally have our forum up so you can go and
read the stuff you may have missed in our first issue.

Please be patient with us, the forum is not complete
and some minor details will be changed including using
our updated logo. A full launch of our
Basslinemagazine.com site will still take place. This
forum will remain, but hopefully our site will truly
reflect the vision I've had for Bassline Magazine
since Day 1 :)

So, go check it out and start posting some shit!

I appologize again that we had references from the mag
to the Web site saying to check out full interviews.
Sometimes things just don't go as planned as you had
hoped! Just a reminder that everyone is working for me
on a volunteer basis, so that largely affects our
production time. I'm still looking for writers and
photographers in our target area ... if you're reading
this then yes, you're in our target area.

Also, WE STILL NEED ADVERTISING!! Please support us
and spread the word. Email
lindsey@basslinemagazine.com for details.

Don't forget Thursday, July 22 at Chemistry in Pbgh a
special Bassline Mag benefit event w/ Nigel Richards.
Come out and support!

Peace&Respect,
Steph

He later mmet Koa Franconi (SuperstarProductions/ DJ Keokiâ€™s brother) in Denver and started one of the longest Thursday dance nights in Denverâ€™s history. With crowds reaching 1500+ a night, Ty was able to spread his musical message to the masses. Tracks 2000 closed it's doors in 2001, but this was far from the end. FactoryOf Dreams Night Club has taken it's place with the same old school feelthe original Tracks 2000 was notorious for. Check out www.factoryofdreams.com 

Ty met Jason and Brad of Together Productions and started a new night tofill the place of Tracks 2000â€™s hiatus.

(Richie Hawtin, Derrick May, Carl Cox,Fat Boy Slim, Pete Tong, Derrick Carter, Saeed & Palash, Deep Dish, DJDan, Moby, Donald Glaude, and many more of the same caliber). Ty also has found a residency every other Saturday at the world-renowned Denver club, The Church. Check outwww.the-church.com Ty's style ranges from funky tech-house to tribal to progressive. His style is geared towards the room being played.

Alongside label partner Little Mike, Ty runs his own record label, whichis already gaining momentum and receiving acclaim from the worlds topDJâ€™s and producers. www.phrunky.com 

In 1999 Ty joined Casa Del Soul. This group of DJ's: SensÃ©,Catt, Foxx, Little Mike, and Wyatt Earp, are friends; co-workers withinthe Casa Del Soul Record Label and the leading choice of talent in Colorado.

the last 10 years.

this isnt actually a music festival. its a contest. the goal is to 
book the absolutely most garbage deejays on your stage. the people 
who booked bugz in the attic lose as theyre the only good people 
on the whole lineup. i'd pay $100 not to go to this event.

I also have this on my HDD at home from when some kind soul Tivo'd it and ripped it over to their
machine in AVI format.

it's huge (341 mb for the hour) so i can't put it on my site for d/l, but it's a good show, worth
hunting down. surprising, really, given the current climate of party-line-supporting media
corporations and their semi-shameless propagandizing habits.

if that site flakes out, might i suggest checking suprnova.org or one of the many other torrent
sites out there...

i respectfully disagree.

tom middelton is worth seeing at least once.

and, though you'd probably disagree, tom, unkle sounds (aka james lavelle and some other guy) is
really very good musically, though i have some issues with lavelle's tendency to sacrifice
dance-floor friendly mixes for stuff that just "sounds cool"....i'd go just to see if he pulled out
the tears for fears "shout"/ dmx "who we be" boot mix.

>I'll agree for the most part, but the Plump DJs, Adam Freeland, 
Unkle Sounds, Hybrid, Stanton Warriors, Hyper, Krafty Kuts and Lee 
Coombs are wickkid. If you're not familar with them I highly 
recommend all of them as they are really pushing the envelope of 
breaks in the UK. 

i am unfortunately familiar with them. new school breaks (or 
whatever theyre calling it this week) are not on the approved 
list. 

as for mark's comments: 

the recentish UNKLE album was alright, never got into the lavelle 
deejay sets so much. cool tunes sometimes, not much in the way of 
flow. 

middleton is like the generic giles peterson (and i dont even like 
him that much). he tries to be too much at once. i DLed that one 
triple mix CD a while ago, and despite a decent track selection it 
got deleted because i never ever listened to it.

<<the recentish UNKLE album was alright>>

not as good as 'psyence fiction', but that was more shadow than lavelle anyway....

<<never got into the lavelle deejay sets so much. cool tunes sometimes, not much in the way of
flow.>>

exactly. even the one or two live ones i've heard are like that.

<<middleton is like the generic giles peterson (and i dont even like him that much).>>

ha!

<<he tries to be too much at once. i DLed that one triple mix CD a while ago, and despite a decent
track selection it got deleted because i never ever listened to it. >>

that was just overkill...even from a hugemongous big name, a triple mix-disc is just too much.

i don't think i've ever made it past 1/2 way throught the second, and that's even letting it run as
background music on the stereo at home while cleaning or painting...

"tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done
done some fucked up shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion, actual

Saturday, July 24 at Abbasso

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 7

TRENDROID (Transport 6, Kinetic, Renaissance, NYC)
feat. Matt Edwards
http://www.trendroid.com

For Pankaj & Matt Edwards (aka Trendroid/Brick City/PM Player) itâ€™s been a dizzying climb up the dance music ranks. It was only four years ago that the legendary NYC club Twilo signed them as the debut artists for their new label. And it's only gotten better for them on the international scene. Trendroid's unique and futuristic style of house music is frequently described as â€œthe sound of the UK with the attitude and energy of NYC.â€

The duo met as first year medical students where they discovered their similar taste in music, influenced by the local scene in New York City in the 1990's. It was an era of creativity, color and eclecticism. The days of NASA, Disco 2000, and Club USA left a strong imprint on them, and they took away from that culture a respect for diversity and forward thinking.

Drawing from these and other influences, they soon got into the studio and wrote their first tracks, "Ignition" and "Hausjam". Twilo used this record as their debut single, and things started snowballing from there. 

Pankaj & Mattâ€™s demand as DJs steadily grew, but it was after Kinetic Records chose Trendroid to mix Transport 6 that they became the newest players on the international scene of headlining djs.

Later, original tracks like â€œTrendicationâ€ on Twisted, â€œ4 Cornersâ€ on FUJU, and the recently released â€œRastafariâ€ on Renaissance becoming landmark tracks. X-press 2 recently asked Trendroid to remix their classic song â€œSmoke Machineâ€ for Skint Records.

Other remixes have included Superchumboâ€™s â€œRevolutionâ€, Murkâ€™s 
â€œDark Beatâ€, and artists as diverse as Jam & Spoon to pop star Mandy Moore. Their tracks have been licensed to the prestigious Cream and Global Underground compilations, among others. It did not take long for their skills to be noticed by top DJ's of all genres, including Deep Dish, Steve Lawler, and Junior Sanchez. 

Whether its underground club tracks or filtered vocal projects, 2004 will demonstrate even further their broad take on house music. Upcoming releases and collaborations will be with Roger Sanchez and Stealth Records. And perhaps their most far reaching & exciting work thus far, â€œRumba Magicâ€ (done under the Brick City alias) caused a massive stir at the 2004 WMC. With multiple Radio 1 plays, confirmed top 20 hype chart placement, and huge support from Carl Cox, Darren Emerson, and dozens of others, it is the type of latin house bomb that cuts through genre barriers and reflects their continued commitment to diversity.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 6

TY TEK (Phrunky, Casa Del Soul, Dirty Blue, Movim)
www.djtytek.com

Ty’s been playing records for eight years and producing for six. Born
and raised in Pueblo, CO. Brought up on a healthy diet of bands such as
TKK, Skinny Puppy, Coil, and Nitzer Ebb, Ty knew that music was the
career of his future. Self taught and eager to play, Ty found his first
residency at Evolution Night Club (Pueblo, CO, 1994-1996), with a four
night per week schedule. Ty moved to Denver, CO in 1997 for a Film/Video
Production degree. In this time, Ty met Koa Franconi (Superstar
Productions/ DJ Keoki’s brother) and started one of the longest Thursday
club/dance nights in Denver’s history. With crowds reaching 1500+ a
night, Ty was able to spread his musical message to the masses. Tracks
2000 closed it's doors in 2001, but this was far from the end. Factory
Of Dreams Night Club has taken it's place with the same old school feel
the original Tracks 2000 was notorious for. Check out
www.factoryofdreams.com 

Ty met Jason and Brad of Together Productions and started a new night to
fill the place of Tracks 2000’s hiatus. Vinyl Night Club
(www.1082broadway.com) is one of Denver’s premier hot spots, with
National and International talent showcased on a weekly basis. Ty began
his Saturday night residency here and has been able to play alongside
some of the worlds best DJ’s. ( Richie Hawtin, Derrick May, Carl Cox,
Fat Boy Slim, Pete Tong, Derrick Carter, Saeed & Palash, Deep Dish, DJ
Dan, Moby, Donald Glaude, and many more of the same caliber).  Ty also
has found a residency every other Saturday at the world-renowned Denver
club, The Church. Some of the biggest names in electronic music have
made their way through this magnificent club. Check out
www.the-church.com . Ty's style ranges from funky tech-house to tribal
to progressive. His style is geared towards the room being played.

Alongside label partner Little Mike, Ty runs his own record label, which
is already gaining momentum and receiving acclaim from the worlds top
DJ’s and producers. Check out www.phrunky.com for all info regarding
this label. In 1999 Ty joined Casa Del Soul. This group of DJ's: Sensé,
Catt, Foxx, Little Mike, and Wyatt Earp, are friends; co-workers within
the Casa Del Soul Record Label and the leading choice of talent in
Colorado. Their main focus is to push innovative music to their
listeners. Casa Del Soul Records has received critical acclaim by
DJ’s/Producers from all over the world with releases from Ty Tek &
Little Mike "Casafied Modern Music 2" featured on Lee Burridge’s
Nu-Breed mix compilation. Other Casa releases have found homes on
compilations from Lexicon Avenue, Doc Martin (Fabric 10) and was on
Muzik magazine’s list of top tech-house recommened labels of 2002.

Jul 16-18                         TEKNIVAL                     Toronto area

Calling all Soundsystems! 

The Toronto Freetekno community will be collaborating once again to 
generate a 2004 teknival. From July 16 to 18 a quiet patch of Ontario 
crown land will become a temporary musical playground for anyone and 
everyone with ears. The event will of course be 100% free. People can show 
up as early as they'd like (some crews may be showing up as early as july 
9) and stay as long as they'd like, until the last partier hits the 
ground. 

ANY and ALL Soundsystems are invited to come set up camp and Jam along 
side the bizarre collection of deranged Torontonians that has come to be 
known as freeteknotoronto. Even if you've never thrown a jam before, feel 
free to get a crew together and set up a stage. You've got the knowlege of 
some seasoned veterans to draw from. Last year we were lucky to be joined 
by collectives from across Ontario, from Quebec and from New York. This 
year promises to be bigger, harder, ect. ect. 

A release of pre-flyers will be circulating in Toronto by mid March. 
We would like an idea of how many stages will be represented this year, so 
if you plan on coming and would like to be included please contact us with 
a YES/NO/MAYBE by the first week in March. More informative flyers should 
hit the street by June 1. If you would like a write-up to appear in these 
flyers, please let us know. 

Also feel free to design your own teknival flyer or web graphic to 
send around to your crew/city/whatever. There's already 3 collectives in 
toronto working on separate designs, reps from other cities are ideal. 
Teknival is a decentralized non-hierarchical event meaning no one person 
or system plans it. It also means that if someone doesn't make it happen, 
it won't. Take it into your own hands and make this event the event you 
want it to be. 

Teknival Sound System Email List: 
If you'd like to be in the loop on the planning process and have your 
say or whatever just email this address and recieve all the communique's 
between systems.

Saturday, July 24 at Abbasso

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 7

TRENDROID (Transport 6, Kinetic, Renaissance, NYC)
feat. Matt Edwards

For Pankaj & Matt Edwards (aka Trendroid/Brick City/PM Player) it’s 
been a dizzying climb up the dance music ranks. It was only four years 
ago that the legendary NYC club Twilo signed them as the debut artists 
for their new label. And it's only gotten better for them on the 
international scene. Trendroid's unique and futuristic style of house 
music is frequently described as “the sound of the UK with the attitude 
and energy of NYC.”

The duo met as first year medical students where they discovered their 
similar taste in music, influenced by the local scene in New York City 
in the 1990's. It was an era of creativity, color and eclecticism. The 
days of NASA, Disco 2000, and Club USA left a strong imprint on them, 
and they took away from that culture a respect for diversity and forward 
thinking.

Drawing from these and other influences, they soon got into the studio 
and wrote their first tracks, "Ignition" and "Hausjam". Twilo used this 
record as their debut single, and things started snowballing from there. 

Pankaj & Matt’s demand as DJs steadily grew, but it was after Kinetic 
Records chose Trendroid to mix Transport 6 that they became the newest 
players on the international scene of headlining djs.

Later, original tracks like “Trendication” on Twisted, “4 Corners” 
on FUJU, and the recently released “Rastafari” on Renaissance becoming 
landmark tracks. X-press 2 recently asked Trendroid to remix their 
classic song “Smoke Machine” for Skint Records.

Other remixes have included Superchumbo’s “Revolution”, Murk’s 
“Dark Beat”, and artists as diverse as Jam & Spoon to pop star Mandy 
Moore. Their tracks have been licensed to the prestigious Cream and 
Global Underground compilations, among others. It did not take long for 
their skills to be noticed by top DJ's of all genres, including Deep 
Dish, Steve Lawler, and Junior Sanchez. 

Whether its underground club tracks or filtered vocal projects, 2004 
will demonstrate even further their broad take on house music. Upcoming 
releases and collaborations will be with Roger Sanchez and Stealth 
Records. And perhaps their most far reaching & exciting work thus far, 
“Rumba Magic” (done under the Brick City alias) caused a massive stir 
at the 2004 WMC. With multiple Radio 1 plays, confirmed top 20 hype 
chart placement, and huge support from Carl Cox, Darren Emerson, and 
dozens of others, it is the type of latin house bomb that cuts through 
genre barriers and reflects their continued commitment to diversity.

Friday July 30      Cleveland, Ohio

Goahead presents The Third Eye V.6
featuring a full psytrance lineup with
our friends from Chicago and New York

S.O.T. (Synchronous Oscillation Technology)
T.O.U.C.H. Samadhi - Chicago

S.O.T(Igor) was transplanted from across the ocean nine years ago with
hopes to learn about this side of the world. At the end of his mission,
the Mothership came to take him back, however alien frequencies of
psychedelic trance lured him in and changed these plans. Based in Chicago,
he began playing/producing with one goal in mind "...to see more people go
ape-shit on a dance floor!.. loose themselves and get reborn.." Igor is
extending the T.O.U.C.H Samadhi healing energy to the Midwest; using
soaring leads and swinging basslines that are sure to keep you
"oscillating" well into the night.

Mp3's at:
http://synchronous.home.comcast.net/html/slide2.html

Dan Efex - Chicago
Dan Efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out
of even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed
shoulder to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an
energetic and intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who
consider him to be one of the founders of the Midwest’s trance scene, a
scene that is still strong and growing today. He was one of the first to
introduce the Midwest to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions
characteristic of some of his styles of trance. But although Dan is
perhaps best known for his trance, do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as
he is skilled! His repertoire of past events includes sets with
progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard techno, hard core, hard
house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it up and keeps it
interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and know precisely
what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind on his musical
excursions.

Ari D - New York/Russia - Goahead's NYC connection,
Ari has wide knowledge of the psytrance genre and that is evident in his
dj sets. Ari has been DJing since 1996, got hooked on psytrance in 2001.
Over the years Ari's sets have progressed to accent diversity of track
selection and variety of mixing techniques. Expect to get a proper taste
of psytekk,
progressive and full-on, all in a building blend of positive dancefloor
energy to get your smile & groove on.

Malachi - Goahead - Akron/Cleveland
Getting things started early.

ARTIST BIO ::

Music has always been a big part of Dennis Rodgers life. Always one to 
actively collect whatever sort of music he was feeling at the moment, it 
wasn't until he reluctantly fell upon house music 4 years ago when it 
took over. During the next few years he developed his sound out of the 
now notorious after hour sessions with the rest of the 112 Crew (Bill 
Patrick, Matt Licata and Tom Amoroso).

It is from these sessions where his talent was discovered and the 
bookings began to roll in. Dennis has come up quickly in NYC playing 
along side DJs such as Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, James Zabiela, 
Funk D'Void, Grant Dell, Casa del sol, Jay Tripwire and more. Dennis and 
the 112 crew held a prestigious residency at Arc NYC until its recent 
closing, and are current residents at Fluid in Philadelphia.

Taking influences from DJs such as Tenaglia, Terry Francis, and Ritchie 
Hawtin. Dennis values these influences but strives to push the sound 
forward "I find no reason in recycling what has been done" he says "I 
constantly try to find new music to keep myself interested and therefore 
the crowd." With a respect for the venue and the vibe of the night 
always evident, he finds a way to direct his sounds at the head but move 
the hips. The ability to find completely unique, techy, quirky, deep 
house and techno has become his trademark.

Dennis recently turned his attention to production joining partners 
Hisham Samawi and Brendan Benke as The Dirty Gringos. Their first 
project "Cowbell" has been instantly successful. It's been played by 
Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, Lee Buridge and recently gained the #2 
spot in URB Magazine for Best new track of the WMC 2003.

On the heels of all of this success Dennis looks forward to the future. 
"Everything seems to be falling into place." The music has become a part 
of him and he looks forward to sharing it with who ever will listen.

    intelligent lighting, making your sensory seasick pupils puke pure
    photons of pixelized pleasure
 *  Fully themed activity areas - expect freaks, fire, bouncy things,
    misting/foam tests and much, much more, all included in the price of
    admission
 *  A rain or shine venue. With plenty of capacity indoor and out, you
    can play in the mud or chill on a couch, or play on the couch in the
    mud
 *  A party for charity. As with our events in the past, a portion of the
    profits will benefit charities such as the ACLU of Wisconsin

    (protecting our right to live without fear), and prostate research
    (protecting the genital areas of you or those close to you). Want to
    see another non-profit charity on the list? Let us know at the door.
 *  Full vending - food, alcohol (for those with IDs), non-alcoholic

 *  Voter registration booths from several states and cities
 *  A spectacular, nature-rific campground, with plenty of room to roam

    keep an eye on you for next year.

This is what you bring:

 *  A canned food donation at the door. As with all of our events, part
    of the price of admission is a non-perishable food donation
 *  A Tent (or a friend with a tent)
 *  Enough food and beverages for the weekend (or some cash - we'll have
    food available for sale)
 *  Leave glass, weapons, drugs and pets (and pets on drugs with weapons)
    at home, but just about anything else is fair game.
 *  Make your site what you want. Bring a couch, a pool table, a pool, a
    sandbox, whatever.
 *  If you need power or water hookups, let us know at the door and we
    can provide it for a small additional charge. We'll be giving away
    free stuff to the most unusual sites.
 *  Respect. For the performers, the venue, the promoters, others around
    you, and yourself.

miss this soulful experience as we get deep into the roots!


Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

We are pleased to welcome our friends from berettamusic in Detriot

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------


BACKLASH
Sundays
at the CHURCH

ELECTRO - SYNTH-POP - ALTERNATIVE - CONNIE FUNK
INDUSTRIAL - NO WAVE - ANTI RAVE

and, yes....a bit of house and techno.

The simple premise of this latest incarnation of THE CHURCH is to provide 
a venue for the new electro-alternative sounds that are being, for the 
most part, ignored by Cleveland club nights and parties.

A mash-up of 20 years of musical sub-genres, the sound is as much familiar 
as it is foreign.

Resident DJs are Rob Sherwood, Briri, and Alex Holt. We are also actively 
seeking new, like-minded DJs to add to our line-up. Interested DJs should 
email ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net.

ALL ARE WELCOME, but if you do come to check us out, PLEASE don't come 
expecting The Church of yesteryear. We are re-building Sunday nights 2 
people at a time, and have a long, long way to go.

18 and over - doors at 10pm - FREE ADMISSION before 11pm - $5.00 after

We are trying to put together an email promotion list, so anyone mailing 
us at ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net before Sunday will be placed on the 
guest list for free admission for 2 people on Sunday 18th, April

Hope to see everyone this Sunday

For the party people who refuse to stop at 2am,

The Shadow Lounge hosts a weekly Friday night
afterhours dance party from 2am-5am. If anyone's down
for some latenight dancing to good soulful music (deep
house, nu jazz, funk) come on down for the party. The
vibe is relaxed and intimate. Some couches if you wish
to chill with a brew but the past few weeks have been
folks on the floor bumping 'n' hustling. Last time I
was there, people were on the tables, the bar
counters, shaking bootay, even breakdancing - a real
dance party a la NYC's Body & Soul or Paradise Garage.
Yours truly occasionally appears on the turntables as
does my DJ crew (Technoir Audio) alongside residents
DJ John Ep & Brother Mike. I'll be bringing some funky
disco records tonight, so if anyone wants to stomp
until sunrise....

like a cross between Boards of Canada and Bjork....

INNER CHILD, TWIN PRODUCTIONS, & DIGITAL GOODTIME, LLC
PITTSBURGH'S THREE POWER HOUSE PRODUCTION COMPANIES PRESENT:

JOHNNY FIASCO
House Legend
(Viva, Om Records, Doubledown)
Chicago, IL
House Music: it=B9s that warm feeling you get in your gut when the basskick
bumps and the beats roll in. It=B9s that soulful fusion of dancefloor rhythms
and electric energy that gives you reason to celebrate even when the world
around you weighs heavy on your shoulders. It=B9s that Windy City groove that
has gone global and back leaving its mark on the world forever. But any
discussion on House Music is totally incomplete without mentioning Johnny
Fiasco.

 As a teen, Johnny knew he wanted to make music. After logging in  countles=
s
hours as a deejay at house parties and clubs during the late 80=B9s,  he got
his big break with a residency at the legendary Red Dog. Deejaying alongsid=
e
DJ Diz, Mark Farina and Spencer Kincey, Johnny quickly cut his chops with
the  best deejays in the US. Through his nights at the club and deejays set=
s
abroad,  Johnny turned heads with his unique sound of jackin=B9 beats, house
grooves,  and flawless mixing. But the story doesn=B9t end there.

Rewind to 1991, when a fledgling Fiasco released "Zig Zag" on Trax Records.
As a young producer, he found himself surrounded by top-notch  producers
from the Chicago area, eventually landing multiple releases on Cajual,
Guidance and Large Records. Johnny=B9s quirky mix of house beats, techno
sounds, and soulful grooves quickly made him one of the most sought after
producers  for music labels around the globe.

More than just a deejay and producer, Johnny Fiasco is a force in  the musi=
c
community that pushes boundaries and challenges the dance community  to
progress into the future. With his ears keenly in tune with the dancefloor,
Johnny is taking us all to new level of sound with a sonic experience of
moods  and grooves.


@ FLAVOR  --  Saturday, August 7

and percussionist Antone Fugate

Drink specials: $3.50 Martinis, $5 Redbull & Vodka, $2 Yuengling

I think it works pretty well.  I might have a couple hundred emails
from the list, but it's in about 75 'conversations' and it remembers
the last email you read so it starts you off at the right place - i
like it.  especially for lists.

the annoying thing is, what if you just wanna save one email from 
all that crap? and what if you get a personal email with the same 
subject line? it all goes to the same place. they make it seem 
like 1 gig is a huge amount of space, like id never have to delete 
another email. i delete over 100 megs of stuff every couple 
months.

when you read an email you want to keep, click the star next to the
person's name who wrote that particular email - moves it to a
different archive for easy access

your flame war was gay from the beginning. it was from out of 
nowhere and included such great rips as "you look at porn". i dont 
know what you expect me to do with set ups like that one. i miss 
the days of darw_n and tevie stee, those guys could actually set 
me up. and what about that guy whose girlfriend was named chastity 
that i called a cunt? that shit was great. you guys need to learn 
from these kinds of people if you wanna get good ones outta me.

this puts not just that message but the whole thread in the 
starred thingy. what if i just wanna save one email from a 100 
post thread? it doesnt let you do that.

Subject: {pb-cle} THIS SUNDAY...JULY 18...10 HOURS, 10 DJS...CLEVELAND

THIS SUNDAY::JULY 18::CLEVELAND
10 HOURS, 10 DJS #9

A FREE monthly showcase of Cleveland area dj talent:

These keep getting bigger and better, and it is always a good fun time to
chill with friends and meet new people into the same music you are!

Get there early because the roadside patio seating goes fast, and early or
late there is always a crowd and good music!

This month adds 5 new djs to the collective, and features 5 repeat
performances.

4:30-5:30
JASON ALIAS
This Mercury Lounge resident returns to the 10-10 project to bring his
signature energy and vibe. Quality house music here, folks.

5:30-6:30
CITIZEN J
One of Akron's finest bringing his house sounds to Cleveland. Definitely
check him out!

6:30-7:30
D-KOI
Big room house is the order of the day for this newcomer to the 10-10
project. We welcome him aboard and hope you will too.

7:30-8:30
NEIL CHASTAIN
Neil is involved in so many area projects that he is often difficult to
track down, but we know you will recognize him. We are happy to welcome Neil
to the decks, and he will be playing selections from his upcoming album.

8:30-9:30
LEE MAJORS
Lee has been djing for quite some time, and while he may be a new face to
most of you his progressive and tribal grooves will keep the party moving.

9:30-10:30
DAMON HAVILL
No stranger to the 10-10 project, Damon's tech goodness is always a welcome
treat to any quality party.

10:30-11:30
SLIM PICKINS
Back at Twist for another of his always entertaining house sets, Jimmy never
fails do disappoint!

11:30-12:30
DAMIEN
Bringing the funky Florida breaks for another one of his dancefloor friendly
sets, you will know the true definition of breaks.

12:30-1:30
OPTHOMAS
New to the project, we are looking forward to the techno sounds of Opthomas
to bring this night to a peak.

1:30-2:30
NOX
Back again! Everyone loves the funky disco stylings of this Kids
Incorporated dj.

Twist has an awesome roadside patio. Space is very limited out there and it
goes very quickly. Start time is 4:30 pm. You can go out EARLY and listen to
great music if you can't stay out late. Plus it's FREE!!

There is a "Make your own Bloody Mary Bar" in effect from 1pm on. This is
great hair of the dog, and a good way to start the afternoon.


All taking place at:

TWIST SOCIAL CLUB
11633 Clifton Blvd.
Cleveland-Lakewood, OH
216.221.2333

**We welcome any other types of artists at these events. If you want to
express yourself, please email doug@poo-bas.com to discuss it. We would like
this to be an open forum for many different types of talent.

** If you are a Cleveland area dj wishing to play these events -- you are
required to attend a few of them and get to know your peers. That's what
this is all about!

UPCOMING
JULY 25::Doug Burkhart early; Stout XTC vs Semaj after 9:30
AUGUST 1::RITHMA along with misterbradleyp
AUGUST 8::Reese vs Doug Burkhart early; Moose vs Nox after 9:30
AUGUST 15::Robin & Perry's Birthday Bash with ROB SHERWOOD, ROBIN HARRIS &

Subject: {pb-cle} gear for sale (mixer and dual cassette deck)

I have a Gemini PS-626 Pro DJ Mixer and an Optimus SCT-49 High Speed Dubbing Dual Cassette Deck for sale.  Details are below.

Asking $25 or best offer for mixer and $20 or best offer for cassette deck.  

I'm willing to ship, but would prefer to meet up with someone in the Pittsburgh area.  I'm moving in a week, so I'm hoping to sell these as soon as possible.

Gemini PS-626 Pro DJ Mixer

- 3 channels w/ phono and line inputs
- mic plugin with talkover feature
- separate gains for bass, mid, and treble plus master gain on all 3 channels
- light plugin

Crossfader has occasional bleed on one side, but can be easily fixed/replaced; bass knob is missing on one channel, but feature still works; knob can be easily fixed/replaced.  Otherwise, works great.  

This link is NOT to my personal mixer, but mine is identical in appearance, except for the missing knob.

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=14986&item=3735747887&rd=1&ssPageName=WDVW

Asking $25 or best offer.



Optimus SCT-48 High Speed Dubbing Stereo Cassette Deck

This is in excellent condition; works great.  For detailed product information, please follow the link below:

http://support.radioshack.com/support_audio/25968.htm

Asking $20 or best offer.

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Thanks!

Dan

Subject: {pb-cle} interesting pretentious music article

http://www.furious.com/perfect/technologytrap.html

i find myself straddling both sides of this guy's argument. in 
alot of ways i find the old way of doing things to be superior. i 
also find the ability of electronic music to allow a single 
composer to also be a performer, arranger, engineer, etc at the 
same time to be the most important musical development since jazz. 
basically, i agree with his whole argument up to a point. his 
theory on the use of vocoders is absolute garbage, even someone 
who has heard kraftwerk once can attest to that. i think his 
choice of electronic musicians that are good belies his intentions 
in writing this: jimi hendrix and stevie wonder stick out of an 
otherwise extremely pretention group of mostly white artsy 
musicians. the man doesnt understand the primal greatness of 
techno and house music. most outstandingly annoying to me are his 
words of praise for brian eno. i love brian eno, i consider him to 
be one of my musical heroes. however, chalking up his success with 
nontraditional structure and composition with electronic 
instruments to his "theory" alone is missing the whole point of 
his music. i know eno cared about the philosophy, this is why he 
put explanations of his ambient pieces in the liner notes. the 
fact that his music exudes mood and texture is the real reason for 
his brilliance. 

these are some of the points i liked the most from this article: 

"Computers have cracked open a plethora of fresh new noises, but 
we scarcely have time to grow accustomed to using one when another 
comes along to make its predecessor outdated. Too few know how to 
program a drum machine well, too few recognize unpalatable digital 
slickness for what it is. "

that really sums up the best parts of his argument. however, i 
dont think that most electronic music is guilty of this. if 
anything, people have accused some techno and house of stagnation 
because of the reliance on the old roland boxes and minimoogs. IDM 
wasnt guilty of this initially, they utilized most of the same 
gear and sounds. now, it, progressive house, drummy techno, and 
drum and bass are the most guilty of pretty much every accusation 
this guy has against electronic music. music is reduced to a cool 
sound, one that doesnt last long before the new sound comes 
along.  part of old school techno and house's appeal to me is its 
rawness, the bad tape edits, the crap pressings of trax records, 
the primitive programming of the generally low end electronic 
instruments. see, these instruments dont force people into 
this "perfection" that alot of electronic music has boxed itself 
into. the mainstream attitude does: liking these ultra-pristine 
forms of music is more akin to liking bad pop music. the dirty old 
techno house idm and jungle is more like punk rock, its more about 
the expression and not the sound. 

yeah, lets argue about this for a while. 

tom

Wow. That sucks on many levels.

And, a big ol' "WTF" on this part:
"On a less painful note, Time Flies will make history on 28 July as the first club night to host an
art exhibition."

I have a feeling there are lots of folks around here (ahem...Flux, anyone?) who would beg to differ
with that statement....

Subject: {pb-cle} July 24 | TRENDROID

Saturday, July 24 at Abbasso

TRENDROID 
feat. Matt Edwards 
(transport 6, kinetic, renaissance) 

For Pankaj & Matt Edwards (aka Trendroid/Brick City/PM Player) itâ€™s been a dizzying climb up the dance music ranks. It was only four years ago that the legendary NYC club Twilo signed them as the debut artists for their new label. And it's only gotten better for them on the international scene. Trendroid's unique and futuristic style of house music is frequently described as â€œthe sound of the UK with the attitude and energy of NYC.â€ 

The duo met as first year medical students where they discovered their similar taste in music, influenced by the local scene in New York City in the 1990's. It was an era of creativity, color and eclecticism. The days of NASA, Disco 2000, and Club USA left a strong imprint on them, and they took away from that culture a respect for diversity and forward thinking. 

Drawing from these and other influences, they soon got into the studio and wrote their first tracks, "Ignition" and "Hausjam". Twilo used this record as their debut single, and things started snowballing from there. 

Pankaj & Mattâ€™s demand as DJs steadily grew, but it was after Kinetic Records chose Trendroid to mix Transport 6 that they became the newest players on the international scene of headlining djs. 

Later, original tracks like â€œTrendicationâ€ on Twisted, â€œ4 Cornersâ€ on FUJU, and the recently released â€œRastafariâ€ on Renaissance becoming landmark tracks. X-press 2 recently asked Trendroid to remix their classic song â€œSmoke Machineâ€ for Skint Records. 

Other remixes have included Superchumboâ€™s â€œRevolutionâ€, Murkâ€™s â€œDark Beatâ€, and artists as diverse as Jam & Spoon to pop star Mandy Moore. Their tracks have been licensed to the prestigious Cream and Global Underground compilations, among others. It did not take long for their skills to be noticed by top DJ's of all genres, including Deep Dish, Steve Lawler, and Junior Sanchez. 

Whether its underground club tracks or filtered vocal projects, 2004 will demonstrate even further their broad take on house music. Upcoming releases and collaborations will be with Roger Sanchez and Stealth Records. And perhaps their most far reaching & exciting work thus far, â€œRumba Magicâ€ (done under the Brick City alias) caused a massive stir at the 2004 WMC. With multiple Radio 1 plays, confirmed top 20 hype chart placement, and huge support from Carl Cox, Darren Emerson, and dozens of others, it is the type of latin house bomb that cuts through genre barriers and reflects their continued commitment to diversity.

thats not really it though. its more nuanced: 

"Music shouldn't be *too* easy or artificial."

is more like it. and the exploration of that line and when it is 
crossed is the interesting discussion that i had hoped would come 
of this. i guess the guy used too much thought for most people on 
this list to actually get through reading the whole damn thing. 
who would wanna talk about music on a music related list?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I tried to get through the whole article, but I couldn't.
 
Some quotes I disagree with:
 
"There is nothing natural about the art of music"
 
I often find myself producing tracks that mimic a particular sound or feeling that I
experienced in a settting of pure nature.  Nature often serves a catalyst for music.
Is love not natural?  Is music never used to express love?
I find music to be a very natural.   If asked "Do you like music?", 99.99 percent of those questioned would answer yes.   And this guy is telling us that the art of music isn't natural?
 
"(Electronic Generators) violate the sanctity of the human performance"
 
????   they are a musical tool.   If they are used to enhance the aesthetic/texture/tone of a musical performace, I don't see how they are violating the performance.   Do people use crappy presets on sound generators and dance around lip synching...yes.  But this type of abuse by some doesn't make electronic sound generators any less artistic than some jackass playing the same retread blues scales for decades.
 
 
I understand some of his points regarding electronics making music more accessible to the masses.  This can (and is) watering down the percentage of music that is quality.  But the overall output of quality music is not in danger.  Many great musicians embrace new sound making tools, and utilize their ease of use to push shit to the next level.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} interesting pretentious music article

i dont think anything that takes 20 or 30 hours to make is easy...i would
say thats about the average amount of time i spent on a jam...the first 5-10
seem to be getting the sounds in order...the next 10-20 are spent
sequencing...and the last 5-10 seem to be spent mixing down and getting the
final eq right


i dont see how anyone can say using a modern sequencer is easy...yes it does
take away from the human element...but if u are really deep into programming
u can do alot to make it sound more human...like turning off the quantiser
and making each velocity a little different

i would say paradox's drums or fanu's drums sound pretty human to me...and
thats all resequenced breaks

one last thought...from the 5th grade on in school i played different
instruments...played everyday alone and with groups...but in the past 5 or
so years of playing with the different computer programs and bits and pieces
of hardware here and there i think ive become a much better musician even
though im not playing a traditional instrument as much now...i understand
rythmn and dynamics much more from sequencing...im getting better at
harmonys too because i have to form all the parts of the harmony instead of
just playing what i see on the score...i think alot of the time classically
trained musicans become score reading robots...just like some producers
become a slave to the quantiser

just my 2cents anyways

I read it all, and I think the guy misses the basic fact that a good musician will make good music with whatever tools are at his disposal. Sure, it may be easier to keep an accurate beat or make whatever sounds you like but your choices are not limited by physical instruments anymore. A musician can create *any* sound or combination of sounds now.

Subject: {pb-cle} interesting pretentious music article

http://www.furious.com/perfect/technologytrap.html

i find myself straddling both sides of this guy's argument. in 
alot of ways i find the old way of doing things to be superior. i 
also find the ability of electronic music to allow a single 
composer to also be a performer, arranger, engineer, etc at the 
same time to be the most important musical development since jazz. 
basically, i agree with his whole argument up to a point. his 
theory on the use of vocoders is absolute garbage, even someone 
who has heard kraftwerk once can attest to that. i think his 
choice of electronic musicians that are good belies his intentions 
in writing this: jimi hendrix and stevie wonder stick out of an 
otherwise extremely pretention group of mostly white artsy 
musicians. the man doesnt understand the primal greatness of 
techno and house music. most outstandingly annoying to me are his 
words of praise for brian eno. i love brian eno, i consider him to 
be one of my musical heroes. however, chalking up his success with 
nontraditional structure and composition with electronic 
instruments to his "theory" alone is missing the whole point of 
his music. i know eno cared about the philosophy, this is why he 
put explanations of his ambient pieces in the liner notes. the 
fact that his music exudes mood and texture is the real reason for 
his brilliance. 

these are some of the points i liked the most from this article: 

"Computers have cracked open a plethora of fresh new noises, but 
we scarcely have time to grow accustomed to using one when another 
comes along to make its predecessor outdated. Too few know how to 
program a drum machine well, too few recognize unpalatable digital 
slickness for what it is. "

that really sums up the best parts of his argument. however, i 
dont think that most electronic music is guilty of this. if 
anything, people have accused some techno and house of stagnation 
because of the reliance on the old roland boxes and minimoogs. IDM 
wasnt guilty of this initially, they utilized most of the same 
gear and sounds. now, it, progressive house, drummy techno, and 
drum and bass are the most guilty of pretty much every accusation 
this guy has against electronic music. music is reduced to a cool 
sound, one that doesnt last long before the new sound comes 
along.  part of old school techno and house's appeal to me is its 
rawness, the bad tape edits, the crap pressings of trax records, 
the primitive programming of the generally low end electronic 
instruments. see, these instruments dont force people into 
this "perfection" that alot of electronic music has boxed itself 
into. the mainstream attitude does: liking these ultra-pristine 
forms of music is more akin to liking bad pop music. the dirty old 
techno house idm and jungle is more like punk rock, its more about 
the expression and not the sound. 

yeah, lets argue about this for a while.

now we're hitting the discussion that i was hoping to get into. 
the idea is that music is a human expression. exactly HOW MUCH 
human interaction can you take out of music before its no longer a 
human expression? 

as trout pointed out, early acid house did include people making 
random acid patterns by taking batteries out of a 303. this doesnt 
necessarily make it a bad thing. the elements at work in 
programming the 909 and tweaking out the 303 were definitely a 
primitive interaction with the performer. but this wasnt all 
people using the 303 either, people like larry heard, guy called 
gerald, and armando were fucking brilliant with those machines, 
some of the most expressive electronic music ever was made by 
them. 

when you look at what you can do now, you can essentially point 
and click your way into music. you dont need to play chords 
anymore, you can click them in on the matrix editor in logic. you 
dont even have to tweak your synths out in real life, you can 
record the tweaks as midi data and perfect them. granted, brian 
eno did experiment with music that didnt involve him almost at all 
(discrete music being a good example) but that was still 
experimental at the time, and he did other music and performance 
with electronics as well.

compare it to, say, early recording where you had a live band with 
2 mics, one for the vocalist and one for the room the band was in. 
if you were good enough, you could nail it in one take, which 
technically wouldnt take much time at all. however getting to that 
level would take crazy amount of experience.

"more human than human"? theres something very funny to me about 
spending mad loot on a software sequencer, then tweaking it out 
bit by bit in order to emulate a human when you could just learn 
how to play a little bit for free and then youre golden. i know 
alot of people who have given up using most quantization when 
playing their key lines, and lord knows it makes things sound 
better because it sounds like a human played them. BECAUSE A HUMAN 
DID PLAY THEM. this is ultra important. 

>i would say paradox's drums or fanu's drums sound pretty human to 
me...and
>thats all resequenced breaks

there is art and expression in that, dont get me wrong. stuff like 
that is actually physically impossible to do "live". those guys 
are also killer at using synths to create atmosphere, their entire 
deal isnt just technical.

im not going to argue these points, but how many people dont work 
like that? i know for a fact that many many producers are just 
lazy useless bastards who make garbage music. and use the studio 
as a crutch to overcome their uselessness. the idea is that 
eliminating "flaws" in the performance doesnt actually make music 
any better or more captivating, yet this is the ultimate goal for 
so many people making crappy electronic music (as i pointed out in 
my original post i think this applies to lots of IDM, prog house, 
drummy techno, and drum and bass especially). how did the values 
behind music get so screwed up?

come on, its not THAT annoying. its a pretty short piece.

>I find music to be a very natural.   If asked "Do you like 
music?", 99.99 percent of those questioned would answer yes.   And 
this guy is telling us that the art of music isn't natural?

music just isnt natural though. we had that discussion a while 
back as to what makes music music, and not just sound. for the 
most part music is a purposeful creating on the part of a human 
being. 

anyway, music is no more natural than the art of painting or the 
art of literature. theyre all human inventions used to express 
something.

this is the nuance of his argument. its not the idea of synthesis, 
obviously there are enough examples of people playing synths 
expressively. the idea is that when the synth is doing ALL the 
work, is it really the work of the artist or is it the work of the 
machine?

this is again not the point. i think hes mostly talking about the 
fact that its not the "great musicians" who are going to influence 
people down the line. its the status quo of lots of pop, hiphop, 
and dance music that says you should strive for perfect machine 
music that is nearly devoid of emotion. this is a very bad thing 
for music.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} interesting pretentious music article

theres merits to both sides of the argument...ill say this tho...i make/play
music that is fun to me...if music isnt fun...it becomes more of a chore
than an expression of a feeling...yes i could go and join an orchestra or
something along those lines...but playing that stuff isnt fun to me
anymore...id much rather sit and program patterns all day on a drum machine
that sit in a group for 3 hours a week and play the same crap i played in
highschool(most of it was crap)


Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

mackie is finally doing this right in the digital world...they are =

this has to be the best thing mackie has put out since the vlz boards!

one of those things....plus mackie control for the sequencer would be =
such a nice setup.

the uk distributor alpha magic closed doors yesterday...meaning the =
demise of some 30 dnb labels plus alot of uk house/techno labels that =
they distributed

alpha magic was distributing the new up and comers that couldnt get =
deals with srd, magic-vinyl or st holdings...i do feel bad for all the =
producers that got screwed in this whole deal...a few of them i talk to =
on the regular and trade bits with...but at the same time...i saw this =
coming for about 8 months...alpha would give anyone that landed a single =
on gain/g2 a deal for for their own label(this was going on cuz one of =
the heads of gain/g2 worked for alpha)...which is bad business...they =
saturated the market with a lot of 12"s that sounded the same...and =
landed themselves in this situation

the upside to this will be that alot of the guys that were having vinyl =
distrib'd by alpha magic will now probably do mp3 releases of the =
material to re-coup some of the expense(i guess u had to put up 1000gbp =
to get a distrib deal with alpha...basically u paid for your first run =
and they covered the next releases if u did well)

i think fanu was hit hardest by this...his next 10 or so releases were =
tied in with different alpha labels

that is a really good idea. now if only they could put midi 
control or whatever in that mixer so that it could be the control 
surface and a mixer, with maybe like a switch or something to 
decide whats what at a given moment.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} my faith in mackie has been restored

its definately on my list...the 12 channel is only 545...and the firewire
card is 400(at sweetwater)...for less than a grand u get a great mixer and
12 channels of 24/96 audio into your pc

all they need to do now is drop the insane prices on the monitors and
control surface...800 a piece for those monitors is outa hand...considering
the truths sound just the same for 300 a pair

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 7

TRENDROID (Transport 6, Kinetic, Renaissance, NYC)
feat. Matt Edwards

For Pankaj & Matt Edwards (aka Trendroid/Brick City/PM Player) it’s 
been a dizzying climb up the dance music ranks. It was only four years 
ago that the legendary NYC club Twilo signed them as the debut artists 
for their new label. And it's only gotten better for them on the 
international scene. Trendroid's unique and futuristic style of house 
music is frequently described as “the sound of the UK with the attitude 
and energy of NYC.”

The duo met as first year medical students where they discovered their 
similar taste in music, influenced by the local scene in New York City 
in the 1990's. It was an era of creativity, color and eclecticism. The 
days of NASA, Disco 2000, and Club USA left a strong imprint on them, 
and they took away from that culture a respect for diversity and forward 
thinking.

Drawing from these and other influences, they soon got into the studio 
and wrote their first tracks, "Ignition" and "Hausjam". Twilo used this 
record as their debut single, and things started snowballing from there. 

Pankaj & Matt’s demand as DJs steadily grew, but it was after Kinetic 
Records chose Trendroid to mix Transport 6 that they became the newest 
players on the international scene of headlining djs.

Later, original tracks like “Trendication” on Twisted, “4 Corners” 
on FUJU, and the recently released “Rastafari” on Renaissance becoming 
landmark tracks. X-press 2 recently asked Trendroid to remix their 
classic song “Smoke Machine” for Skint Records.

Other remixes have included Superchumbo’s “Revolution”, Murk’s 
“Dark Beat”, and artists as diverse as Jam & Spoon to pop star Mandy 
Moore. Their tracks have been licensed to the prestigious Cream and 
Global Underground compilations, among others. It did not take long for 
their skills to be noticed by top DJ's of all genres, including Deep 
Dish, Steve Lawler, and Junior Sanchez. 

Whether its underground club tracks or filtered vocal projects, 2004 
will demonstrate even further their broad take on house music. Upcoming 
releases and collaborations will be with Roger Sanchez and Stealth 
Records. And perhaps their most far reaching & exciting work thus far, 
“Rumba Magic” (done under the Brick City alias) caused a massive stir 
at the 2004 WMC. With multiple Radio 1 plays, confirmed top 20 hype 
chart placement, and huge support from Carl Cox, Darren Emerson, and 
dozens of others, it is the type of latin house bomb that cuts through 
genre barriers and reflects their continued commitment to diversity.

Friday July 30      Cleveland, Ohio

Goahead presents The Third Eye V.6
featuring a full psytrance lineup with
our friends from Chicago and New York

S.O.T. (Synchronous Oscillation Technology)
T.O.U.C.H. Samadhi - Chicago

S.O.T(Igor) was transplanted from across the ocean nine years ago with
hopes to learn about this side of the world. At the end of his mission,
the Mothership came to take him back, however alien frequencies of
psychedelic trance lured him in and changed these plans. Based in Chicago,
he began playing/producing with one goal in mind "...to see more people go
ape-shit on a dance floor!.. loose themselves and get reborn.." Igor is
extending the T.O.U.C.H Samadhi healing energy to the Midwest; using
soaring leads and swinging basslines that are sure to keep you
"oscillating" well into the night.

Dan Efex - Chicago
Dan Efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out
of even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed
shoulder to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an
energetic and intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who
consider him to be one of the founders of the Midwest’s trance scene, a
scene that is still strong and growing today. He was one of the first to
introduce the Midwest to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions
characteristic of some of his styles of trance. But although Dan is
perhaps best known for his trance, do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as
he is skilled! His repertoire of past events includes sets with
progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard techno, hard core, hard
house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it up and keeps it
interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and know precisely
what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind on his musical
excursions.

Ari D - New York/Russia - Goahead's NYC connection,
Ari has wide knowledge of the psytrance genre and that is evident in his
dj sets. Ari has been DJing since 1996, got hooked on psytrance in 2001.
Over the years Ari's sets have progressed to accent diversity of track
selection and variety of mixing techniques. Expect to get a proper taste
of psytekk,
progressive and full-on, all in a building blend of positive dancefloor
energy to get your smile & groove on.

Malachi - Goahead - Akron/Cleveland

Treasurer’s office and District Attorney’s Office – in conjunction 
with Animal Friends, the Animal Rescue League of Western Pennsylvania, 
and the Humane Society of Western Pennsylvania.

This event will include performances by a dance group called Nu Spin, 
music by Kaleo and Disco Dan, a performance by The Bastard Sons of 
Magdalene featuring Lexa Russelle, and a dance party featuring DJ 
Sensitive. There will be art on display by Johnross of New York City and 
Mark Murdzak, voted "Best Visual Artist" in Pittsburgh 2001 by the INPGH 
2001 Readers Polls. Featured local designer labels will include 
iroNiece, JDY, Spoonfed, Focal Point, N‘Dogo, Immaculata, and guest 
designer WE Are TECH by Chelsea Snyder of San Fransisco. Featured 
stylists include Aimee McWhorter-Compton and Regina Wilderman of Salon 
Nuvo. There will be a Chinese auction for pet related and other donated 
items, to benefit AAARF. Massage by Jessica Proia, M.T. and Stephanie 
Guiffre, L.M.T. will be offered throughout the evening. There will also 
be food and beverage available.

The Jane Doe Project will be held Saturday July 31. Doors will open at

ARTIST BIO ::

Music has always been a big part of Dennis Rodgers life. Always one to 
actively collect whatever sort of music he was feeling at the moment, it 
wasn't until he reluctantly fell upon house music 4 years ago when it 
took over. During the next few years he developed his sound out of the 
now notorious after hour sessions with the rest of the 112 Crew (Bill 
Patrick, Matt Licata and Tom Amoroso).

It is from these sessions where his talent was discovered and the 
bookings began to roll in. Dennis has come up quickly in NYC playing 
along side DJs such as Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, James Zabiela, 
Funk D'Void, Grant Dell, Casa del sol, Jay Tripwire and more. Dennis and 
the 112 crew held a prestigious residency at Arc NYC until its recent 
closing, and are current residents at Fluid in Philadelphia.

Taking influences from DJs such as Tenaglia, Terry Francis, and Ritchie 
Hawtin. Dennis values these influences but strives to push the sound 
forward "I find no reason in recycling what has been done" he says "I 
constantly try to find new music to keep myself interested and therefore 
the crowd." With a respect for the venue and the vibe of the night 
always evident, he finds a way to direct his sounds at the head but move 
the hips. The ability to find completely unique, techy, quirky, deep 
house and techno has become his trademark.

Dennis recently turned his attention to production joining partners 
Hisham Samawi and Brendan Benke as The Dirty Gringos. Their first 
project "Cowbell" has been instantly successful. It's been played by 
Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, Lee Buridge and recently gained the #2 
spot in URB Magazine for Best new track of the WMC 2003.

On the heels of all of this success Dennis looks forward to the future. 
"Everything seems to be falling into place." The music has become a part 
of him and he looks forward to sharing it with who ever will listen.

Mixes available at 112crew.com

Saturday, August 7
JOHN HOWARD @Wish
(om, leaf, i-mix, all world, san francisco)
http://www.om-records.com

John Howard is a legend in house music, a reputation that was cemented 
by his mind-blowing, emotionally moving performance at our Summer Series 
last year. A performance so amazing that we had no choice but to bring 
him back! If you missed him the first time around, do what you must to 
make sure you catch him for Round 2.

John started DJing in 1993, during San Francisco’s infamous Summer of 
Love. His first regular appearances were at Groove Kitchen and the 
Boogie Buffet with Mark Farina. Then on to Stompy Stomp, Together with 
Dubtribe, Spundae, and Wicked.

John’s sound is smooth San Fran funk fused with a large dose of Chicago 
style, combined with his own brand of eclectic jazz and Bay Area 
influences. It’s always funky, and it’s always different. In fact, 
after running into John in San Fran this past June, he promised us a 
whole new world of sounds up his sleeve. Never content with the status 
quo, John continues to innovate.

production career, he has already had tracks featured

The Third Eye v.5

Goahead productions continues The Third Eye ritual. Don’t
miss this soulful experience as we get deep into the roots!


Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

We are pleased to welcome our friends from berettamusic in Detriot

BACKLASH
Sundays
at the CHURCH

ELECTRO - SYNTH-POP - ALTERNATIVE - CONNIE FUNK
INDUSTRIAL - NO WAVE - ANTI RAVE

and, yes....a bit of house and techno.

The simple premise of this latest incarnation of THE CHURCH is to provide 
a venue for the new electro-alternative sounds that are being, for the 
most part, ignored by Cleveland club nights and parties.

A mash-up of 20 years of musical sub-genres, the sound is as much familiar 
as it is foreign.

Resident DJs are Rob Sherwood, Briri, and Alex Holt. We are also actively 
seeking new, like-minded DJs to add to our line-up. Interested DJs should 
email ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net.

ALL ARE WELCOME, but if you do come to check us out, PLEASE don't come 
expecting The Church of yesteryear. We are re-building Sunday nights 2 
people at a time, and have a long, long way to go.

18 and over - doors at 10pm - FREE ADMISSION before 11pm - $5.00 after

We are trying to put together an email promotion list, so anyone mailing 
us at ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net before Sunday will be placed on the 
guest list for free admission for 2 people on Sunday 18th, April

Hope to see everyone this Sunday

For the party people who refuse to stop at 2am,

The Shadow Lounge hosts a weekly Friday night
afterhours dance party from 2am-5am. If anyone's down
for some latenight dancing to good soulful music (deep
house, nu jazz, funk) come on down for the party. The
vibe is relaxed and intimate. Some couches if you wish
to chill with a brew but the past few weeks have been
folks on the floor bumping 'n' hustling. Last time I
was there, people were on the tables, the bar
counters, shaking bootay, even breakdancing - a real
dance party a la NYC's Body & Soul or Paradise Garage.
Yours truly occasionally appears on the turntables as
does my DJ crew (Technoir Audio) alongside residents
DJ John Ep & Brother Mike. I'll be bringing some funky
disco records tonight, so if anyone wants to stomp
until sunrise....

Not that all the people I send this to are going to care but I am asking =
for you to keep my dumb butt in prayer today as I am facing a probation =
review for dumb choices I made recently by smoking pot... not worth the =
high thats for sure.. recently I transfered my probation back to the =
county I am now in and was asked to pee... I knew I was in for some =
trouble.. I just want you all to know I love you and that I am trying to =
change my crappy decisions.. it has been a long hard up and down road =
with some good and some not so good choices on my part. If given the =
opportunity I am definately going to do the right thing from here on =
out... my only loves in life are my daughter, my family, my fiancee', =
and my love of music.. I cherish these freedoms but choose instead to =
get high and put all this at risk.. please pray for grace and mercy on =
my behalf today as I face possibly jail and or prison time for my poor =
judgement. I love you all and hope to see you soon... Jayson T. Stefanek

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Pray for me..

<<I am 
asking for you to keep my dumb butt in prayer today>>

well I personally cant help you there, being an
Atheist and all...  ;-) however I do wish you luck!!!

<< I transfered my probation back to 
the county I am now in and was asked to pee...>>

I went thru this a few years ago and failed piss tests
SEVERAL times and even got caught cheating on one, but
never served 1 second in jail so you may be ok
anyways.

<<I just want you all to know I love you and that I am
trying to 
change my crappy decisions.>>

See now, you have the WRONG attitude about this. You
are feeling SO guilty for doing something that def.
should be legal. This is how the pigs who run things
around here WANT you to feel. This is how they
manipulate and take the fight out of us to get this
incredibly foolish and destructive law changed.

<< I cherish these freedoms but choose instead to get
high 
and put all this at risk.>>

Again, I repeat my response from above only adding
that smoking pot SHOULD be a part of those freedoms. 

After going thru this whole thing myself I came to the
following conclusions:

My belief that the marijuana laws are totally stupid
was only reinforecd that much more. I think I even
made some really good points about this to my P.O.
that he really had a hard time disputing.

If it ever happens again (it is bound to some day) I
will not play along AT ALL. I will tell the judge, my
P.O. that I STRONGLY believe these laws need to be
changed and I personally will not obey them. I would
NEVER voluntarily submit to any drug test. Short of
them restraining me and drawing blood against my will
they will never violate my 5th amendment privlage of
refusing to testify against myself. I would tell them
I don't even care about jail time, I will gladly rot
forever I feel so strongly about this, it is a cause I
have dedicated myself to... you could give me a death
sentence and I still would not bow to the stupidity. I
believe it is a civil rights issue. If you DO imprison
me, you WILL have to drag me off to jail and once
there I would refuse to cooperate - even going so far
as refusing to eat.

Look at the past. Many, MANY people have gone to jail,
died, suffered in many ways for causes they truly
believe in. If everyone who was on probation for pot
(I STILL cant believe it is illegal!!!) did this, I
guarantee the system would fail and they would be
FORCED to re-examine and ultimately change things.

Good luck bro... but PLEASE don't sit there feeling
all guilty and stewing about it all day... THATS HOW
THEY WIN... FIGHT THEM!!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Pray for me..

I'm with everyone else on this that is shouldn't be illegal.  I doubt 
you'll get much actual praying around here since a lot of us "rebels" 
and "drug users" (you know, since that's all raves are for according to 
the press) aren't all that religeous (must be from all the drug use) but 
I do wish you luck.

Don't get bogged down and feel guilty about it.  It's the system gone 
terribly wrong.  We imprison pot smokers but let murder's and rapists 
who were "criminally insane" walk around on the streets.  And just to 
prevent some hate mail, I'm sure there are some valid cases where people 
can go insane and kill people, but it get's abused way too much.

AA??  alcoholics anonymous???  man that's f'ed up.  So instead of 
taxpayers paying for you in jail, we get to pay for AA meetings that 
probably won't change you any.  Its you that can change yourself, not 
standing up and saying "Hi, my name is jayson, and I smoked pot."  at an 
alcoholics anonymous meeting on top of it.

ps if AA means something else in this case, then my bad and just ignore 
all this as me being bored at work.

Whoa!  You have to spend x hours 4 times a week for the next year and a
half?

That's gotta be over 300 hours of counseling.  That's not counseling; that's
reprogramming :)  

You are going to need Counseling Anonymous after that!

it's still beating it's last beat and the victim murmering under

Subject: {pb-cle} Trendroid TONIGHT 7/24


The Transport series is legendary; now's your chance to hear the 
people that took it in a new direction with Transport 6: 
Trendroid!

Tonight in Cleveland, Matt Edwards will be here from New York City 
to do it up in a, as one reviewer calls, "Throbbing pulsing 
twisted shadowed ensorcelled tribal psychedelic frenzy."

Just five bucks before 11. Would you ever get to see any of the 
other Transport artists for $5? Nope.

with additional DJ sets by Deviant and Brandon Gill

sat, july 24:: 9p-4a, 21+
$5 before 11p, $10 after
pre-sale tickets by credit card available at 
http://www.groovetickets.com or by cash at Poo-Bas Record Shoppe

I dunno why Trout's always gotta make up weird shit. It's not a party in
my pants. We already DID that one. And...

Say it together with me folks...

We did it ALL NIGHT LONG.

This has been a public service announcement from the P.... [signal
intercepted]

We regret to inform you that the Pursuit of Happiness managers
responsible for the foregoing message has been sacked. It was a good
sacking, too.

Dear Jayson,

I hope you learned from this experience and will not make the same=20

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ..to Mike...was "Pray for me"

Thanks Mike, I know now at least for myself that getting high is not an
option.. I have begun going to NA meetings not only by requirement but I go
to almost twice as many as I am required to now. I have no other option but
to stay clean and sober.. I love the scene and the kids in it but I have to
stay straight in order to put some priorities back in their proper place in
my life. Getting caught or not isn't an option I have come to realize That I
want to be able to be an honest man with everyone I come in contact with..
if that means not getting high or drunk in order to do that then that is the
choice I have to make for my personal life. I don't down anyone else for
their choices but the choice for me is very clear now.. No Drugs and this
includes alcohol.. Doesn't mean you all won't see me around at some good
parties just probably not for a while till I have a grip on my life. Whats
the sense of going to see a dj spin some phat records if it isn't going to
be remembered, I am too messed up to dance to the music, or if it is going
to throw me into using things that with put my daughter, my fiance', and my
life in jeapordy? The choice is clear to me so... I do agree theree are some
really stupid laws and that the "man" is in some wayss trying to get us all
down on our lifestyles and choices.. but right now is not the time for me to
blame th system or anyone else It is instead time to make some responsible
choices and and get my affairs in order. Taking responsibility for my life
isn't the easiest thing to do but it is the only option I have left if I
value my life and freedom at all. Thanks for your post and keep on keepin on
brother,
Jay
a.k.a.- Deep

Dear Jayson,

I hope you learned from this experience and will not make the same
mistakes again. When you have a family it helps to keep things in some
perspective. If you're going to get high, don't get caught.

Subject: {pb-cle} technoleptik realmz

so i guess pbcle slept on this one.  i didn't see anyone from here that 
i knew.

this was a hell of a party, lots of good techno & hardcore.  the 
headliners were more or less the lowlights (venom, heather heart, 
frankie bones).  i really wasn't into any of their sets, and the crap 
venom plays.  holy barf batman....  the locals totally stole this one.  
rob rage was too much.  ripped shit up on 3 decks.  that man is 
columbus' best kept secret.  chibi v was good to finally see in person.  
billy b.  more techno yumminess.  another cols local i guess.  gannon 
had some good stuff....

good sound. lots of lasers.  lots of lights.... lots of space.  an 
oxygen bar?

hopefully things will keep going off down there on creekway drive.  
those warehouses are DOPE.

So, like, isn't it supposed to be Narcotics *Anonymous*? I mean, how 
anonymous are you being here?

Anyhow, good luck with all the 12-stepness. Make sure you ask "God" to 
help you out and all that shit. Tell him I said hi, and that I said he's 
a lying sick bastard.

You definitely should not do drugs if you can't handle them, and I'm 
down with the clean and sober shit if it's what you gotta do to get your 
stuff together. Either way, it's just a choice, and you don't really 
need anyone to help you make that choice once you've made a decision. I 
think the whole, "I need help to stay off drugs" shit is a cop-out for 
people who don't want to take responsibility for their lives. I dated a 
girl who used to be on H, and she took herself off, went thru detox, and 
fixed her life. The "rehab" people tried to convince her that she needed 
them to succeed, and when she said she didn't want their fucking help, 
they told her she'd FAIL. Fucking bastards. They WANT people to fail. 
They want their "customers" to keep coming back and coming back and 
needing them. You know, when you tell people shit like that, a lot of 
them will believe it and internalize it and FAIL because they were TOLD 
they would.

You don't need 12-steps. Just one. Make a fucking decision.

YES!!! There IS someone out there who feels as I do. I
couldn't agree more with Brent on this. You are thier
bitch now. There are worse things than jail... letting
someone run your life for you and make you feel guilty
for nothing, is to me FAR worse. You may not
physically be in jail, but trust me, you ARE in jail.
They have shackled you mentally and you are anything
but free. I feel sorry for you and your inability to
stand up for yourself and what is right. What a shame.

Cylob will be playing a live set at Capsule on Sunday the 22nd of 
August.
It's the only date in this part of the Midwest.  If there is anyone out 
in Detroit, Cincinatti, Dayton, Pittsburg, Columbus, and any other 
place I might be forgetting that can help me get the word out, I could 
use the help.
I am having a large number of flyers printed up this week and would 
like to send them out to record stores or other relevant venues that 
would happily display them.  If you know of such places in your area, 
please email me the addresses privately.  If you host a website that 
lists shows--please add it to your calendar.
Thanks!

Just a reminder---
 
Plate Tectonics is pleased to present a talented local DJ lineup @ Wish Nightclub on Friday July 30th 

Lineup includes: 
Jamie Tyler 
Funk Detective 
Andy James 
and Boompsie 


Expect anywhere from funky, glitchy minimal tech, to housey, tribal or bumping techno...but definitely techno and good vibes. 

This is going to be a super cheap party ($2) since we just want you to be able to come out, dance, and have fun. 
Wish is located on Johnson Court, just off W. 6th.
Adn I guess we're working on some drink specials. 
 
We know it's a busy weekend, much love to the Third Eye crew of course!  But if you can stop in def. do. : )
 
If you want to join the plate tectonics mailing  list send a message to plate_tec@yahoo.com

Um yeah it is anonymous for other reasons..like people losing their jobs
and what not.. but I can choose to share my life with whomever I wish..
anyways..Sounds like you have some sort of personal issues with God but
doesn't mean you should close your mind to it working for others or
disrespect the fact that it is or may be what is working for them... I agree
that I don't "need" anyone else to help me
but my life and thinking and friends were so centered around using drugs and
getting them and ways to do them that right now I appreciate the support
these groups and meetings provide me.. I am definately not sold out for NA
and I
am definately not some sort of poster child but I do appreciate the advice
and support of people who have been there done that and have the t-shirt..
know what I mean? I won't go to a rehab those people are definately more
messed up than most the people they help. Just remember that not everything
is some sort of universal law... what works for one person may not be what
works for another.. I am 28 years young and I definately am not going to do
whatever the hell someone else says is the only way... I take everything
with a grain of salt.. who knows one day I may be able to smoke pot or have
a beer and not worry that it will lead me into doing other dumb things.. but
right now what things I am choosing to do are what is helping me and
that is what I will stick with if it means that it make a better life and
better
world for my four year old daughter to live in.. In any case thaanks for
the feed back and hope to see you around or talk to you again real soon. I'm
outty..

so i guess pbcle slept on this one.  i didn't see anyone from here that 
i knew.

this was a hell of a party, lots of good techno & hardcore.  the 
headliners were more or less the lowlights (venom, heather heart, 
frankie bones).  i really wasn't into any of their sets, and the crap 
venom plays.  holy barf batman....  the locals totally stole this one.  
rob rage was too much.  ripped shit up on 3 decks.  that man is 
columbus' best kept secret.  chibi v was good to finally see in person.

billy b.  more techno yumminess.  another cols local i guess.  gannon 
had some good stuff....

good sound. lots of lasers.  lots of lights.... lots of space.  an 
oxygen bar?

hopefully things will keep going off down there on creekway drive.  
those warehouses are DOPE.

this was the most fun i've had since lord of the raves in toronto.

Enough. Enough of this bullshit. I've been quiet on this thread since it started, but I really,
sincerely can't take any more of this "holier than thou", "we're on a mission to fight the man"
grass roots bullshit.

Smoking weed does not make you Rosa fucking Parks.

This is a personal decision being made by a person whose life is quite literally on the line....How
dare you selfish fucks accuse him of giving in to "the man" when this guy is fighting for whatever
part of his life that hasn't been ruined by these horrible policies.

It's so very easy to condemn this guy from behind your keyboard, isn't it?

Jayson wants to avoid jail so that he can be there for his kid(s), and I think he needs to be
supported (ESPECIALLY BY THIS COMMUNITY) for that decision. He is man enough to recognize that his
family is important to him and that he needs to be responsible for them.

But instead of supporting him, you're being just as closed-minded as those who created the policies
you all claim to be "fighting" against...encouraging him to behave selfishly by continuing to engage
in behavior that has a 99.9% probability of taking him away from his family IS NOT the way to get
lawmakers' attention and IS NOT THE WAY TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE.

There are worse things than being in jail. Like....not having a dad because he's in jail. Or not
seeing your kid because you're in jail.

I feel sorry for those who can't recognize another man fighting to do what's right for himself, and
condemn him for it.

YES!!! There IS someone out there who feels as I do. I
couldn't agree more with Brent on this. You are thier
bitch now. There are worse things than jail... letting
someone run your life for you and make you feel guilty
for nothing, is to me FAR worse. You may not
physically be in jail, but trust me, you ARE in jail.
They have shackled you mentally and you are anything
but free. I feel sorry for you and your inability to
stand up for yourself and what is right. What a shame.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ..to Mike...was "Pray for me"

Wow thanks man! Hey by the way I don't NEED anyone to tell me to fight the
man.. I ahve done that and my daughter was without me for 2 and half years..
I know what decisions I am going to make and they are not because the "man"
or "NA" or anyone else wants me to make them.. I am not brainwashed or being
controlled.. I simply have had enough of my own bullshit.. time to grow up..
On the flip side thanks for your support.. and while I don't NEED anyone to
tell me what to do.. I do need the encouragement from my peers.. you
provided that despite what others were saying. Thatnks again mark.
with that I'm out!

the reason they get away with passing stupid bullshit laws is because people

we are all condemning him because we live and pay taxes in a country that

no one is encouraging him!!! he needs to not let NA and the law make his 
disicions for him. forced rehab for pot smokers is fucking stupid. i dont 
want him turning into one of those crazy NA people afraid to be a part of a 
community where drugs may be present, espesially over some fucking pot! NA 
turns people into lunatics that condemn anyone that has ever tried even a 
small amount of anything to being a drug addict for the rest of they're 
lives, and that they're only hope is that stupid fucking program!


i do encourage him to not get caught. its not that difficult.

dude you are the BIGGEST fucking asshole... you are
going to physically threaten him now??? Fuck you and
everything about you, you are a total piece of shit.
Tell your kids you care about so much how daddy can't
handle dissenting opinions so he is going to beat
someone up. Voicing opinon is one thing, violence is
another. I thought I just disagreed with you but now I
actually HATE you. I would tell you to go to hell if I
believed in it... oh, but you do believe so go to
fucking hell I guess. Unbelievable.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Markets?

I'm looking for markets in Northeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. If
you're familiar with any of the following then you know what I'm talking
about:

West Market - Cleveland
North Market - Columbus
Findlay Market - Cincinnati
Jungle Jim's - Cincinnati
Pike Place Market - Seattle

What's in Pb-Cle Land that I don't know about... and who wants to go this
weekend?

J.[M]

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Markets?

the best part of the west side market its the brats or pizza bagels

if u go there about closing time on saturday u catch great deals on
steaks...last time i was there i caught 8 big porterhouse steaks for like 60
bux...each steak was well over 20oz too...they'd rather sell stuff super
cheap than throw it out on saturday

Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} ..to Brent&Aaron...was "Pray for me"

Brent,
If there is one thing I hate about "talking" through typing it is that you
lose that all important inflection of voice so needed to tall wether one is
jokingly saying they will beat you down or if they are actually going to. So
here is a little tip. If ever actually ment someone physical harm... the
last thing I would do is post it for one, and for two I would just do it..
not type it or say it whatever the case may be. Nox/ Brent you personally
know me. So I felt I could tell you to shut up and play with you a bit
without you taking it so damn seriously.. Maybe you need to smoke a little
bit MORE pot. Relax!

As far as you Aaron.. well I don't even know you but I don't believe I was
even "speaking to you either... the little comments you keep making sound
like you are one step behind Brent like some turtlehead he forgot to shit
out.. Are you that far up his ass? I suggest you pick out topics you have
something worthwhile to say something in and other than that maybe you also
need to smoke some more of your oh so beloved marijuana. For you to say you
hate me and that I am an asshole and to have never known me is ignorant and
immature. Again I will say it.. who the hell was talking to you anyways? If
you knew me in any way you would know I have never been nor will I ever be a
violent person.. As far as your opinions on hell...well sounds like you are
a little confused.. ever considered seeking help yourself?
Point have been made the topic is mute... and you children need to calm the
heck down.. if you are that bored that you are just waiting for the next
retarded arguement to get involved in well you should be able to answer the
question as to why your musical careers are in the toilet and your music is
shitty as your attitudes... spend more time finding ways to encourage the
people in your scene and less ways to disagree with them and maybe you will
one day actually have some respect from your peers.. and though I am a bit
older than you I am still one of your peer group.. jumping on statements
like I made before clearifying them is the dumbest thing you could have
done.. and besides.. I couldd care less what you think anyways. Grow up! And
please don't drag this thing out.. posting the next best thing to say... no
one wins these things once they start just drop it and end this trhead
here.. no one cares if you sound cooler than me.. but if you must respond
just know that I won't respond back.
Deep

Damn I wish my name wasn't on this thread.

I've privately e-mailed with Jayson, I don't think he's wrong to quit 
weed or anything else that's messing up his life. I seriously understand 
how that can be the most mature decision he could possibly make, and I 
wish him the very best in his sobriety.

With that having been said, don't disrespect people on the other side of 
the line who choose to smoke, they have every bit as much right to do 
that as "Rosa fucking Parks" did to sit in the front of the goddamn bus. 
Just because you're not a black woman or a pot smoker doesn't mean you 
have the moral perspective to condemn those who feel oppressed by the 
system.

His decision to quit is deserving of respect and support. I don't think 
I can be any clearer about it than that.

The fact is, the rehab centers and NA and all the rest are nothing 
better than a fucking cult. I can respect Jayson without giving credit 
to those assholes.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Markets?

Mmm. Lunch tomorrow. The North Market has to be my favorite and probably 
the best market of its type around. Clean, not ever too crowded, and the 
best food for hundreds of miles. The guy that runs the Pure Imagination 
chocolate shop gave us about $20 in samples once, and that's just how it 
goes with all the vendors. You can have lunch there without actually 
buying anything really, but that's pretty lame.

Bad news tho: they closed Braddock's Diner, which was the best place to 
get a beer and breakfast at 7AM. (Note: I occasionally work 3rd shift).

Grapes of Mirth also is da bomb in the north market. MMM. Beer. MMM. 
Wine. I find one of the best things about the north market is the 
variety of things you can get to drink, alcoholic and non. It's one of 
the few places I've seen Bawls for sale cold, and you can also get about 
a dozen different kinds of micro brew root beer at the sausage place.

There's nothing not really really good at the North Market. And it's not 
all expensive either, although you can seriously blow some cash there.

Ooh, and they carry Jeni's Ice Cream at Stauf's now... the best of 
everything under one roof. (Not to mention their high speed free wifi.) 
I've pretty much been camped out there with a laptop for the last few 
weeks, which explains them beefing the wifi security.

Fuck I'm hungry. Columbus has so much good stuff to offer culinarily 
speaking. Maybe it'll be some Schmidt's tomorrow instead. Or maybe I'll 
find a hot date to take to Handke's (but monkeys may also fly out my ass).

for you tho in his place!

Artists:

Malachi - Goahead - Akron,Ohio
The man behind Goahead productions
Getting the psy-vibe started early.

Dj Meghan - Goahead - Cleveland
Meghan needs no introduction. She
has had numerous appearances at events
in the midwest and east coast and has released
a new mix cd "Spring Fever" which will be handed out
to a few lucky people. She has already gathered
alot of new material for this set!

Ari D - Goahead - New York City
Ari has wide knowledge of the psytrance genre and that is evident in his
dj sets. Ari has been DJing since 1996, got hooked on psytrance in 2001.
Over the years Ari's sets have progressed to accent diversity of track
selection and variety of mixing techniques. Expect to get a proper taste
of psytekk,progressive and full-on, all in a building blend of positive
dancefloor energy to get your smile & groove on.

S.O.T. (Synchronous Oscillation Technology)
T.O.U.C.H. Samadhi - Chicago
S.O.T(Igor) was transplanted from across the ocean nine years ago with
hopes to learn about this side of the world. At the end of his mission,
the Mothership came to take him back, however alien frequencies of
psychedelic trance lured him in and changed these plans. Based in Chicago,
he began playing/producing with one goal in mind "...to see more people go
ape-shit on a dance floor!.. loose themselves and get reborn.." Igor is
extending the T.O.U.C.H Samadhi healing energy to the Midwest; using
soaring leads and swinging basslines that are sure to keep you
"oscillating" well into the night.

Mp3's at:
http://synchronous.home.comcast.net/html/slide2.html

Kaiser Soze - Massive, PTLF - Milwaukee, WI.
Hailing from the brew city. Kaiser Soze has been djing goa/psy trance
since 1997. His style mixes old and new with a touch of the Milwaukee
hardcore feel. Be prepared for a non-stop roller coaster of wicked tunes.

There is also a free Goahead party featuring Dj Boompsie
and other guests t.b.a. planned for Sat. 7-31-04
Details tba at the third eye and check our mailing list
for updates.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Friday July 30      Cleveland, Ohio

Goahead presents The Third Eye V.6
featuring a full psytrance lineup with
our friends from Chicago and New York

S.O.T. (Synchronous Oscillation Technology)
T.O.U.C.H. Samadhi - Chicago

S.O.T(Igor) was transplanted from across the ocean nine years ago with
hopes to learn about this side of the world. At the end of his mission,
the Mothership came to take him back, however alien frequencies of
psychedelic trance lured him in and changed these plans. Based in Chicago,
he began playing/producing with one goal in mind "...to see more people go
ape-shit on a dance floor!.. loose themselves and get reborn.." Igor is
extending the T.O.U.C.H Samadhi healing energy to the Midwest; using
soaring leads and swinging basslines that are sure to keep you
"oscillating" well into the night.

Mp3's at:
http://synchronous.home.comcast.net/html/slide2.html

Dan Efex - Chicago
Dan Efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out
of even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed
shoulder to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an
energetic and intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who
consider him to be one of the founders of the Midwest’s trance scene, a
scene that is still strong and growing today. He was one of the first to
introduce the Midwest to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions
characteristic of some of his styles of trance. But although Dan is
perhaps best known for his trance, do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as
he is skilled! His repertoire of past events includes sets with
progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard techno, hard core, hard
house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it up and keeps it
interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and know precisely
what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind on his musical
excursions.

Ari D - New York/Russia - Goahead's NYC connection,
Ari has wide knowledge of the psytrance genre and that is evident in his
dj sets. Ari has been DJing since 1996, got hooked on psytrance in 2001.
Over the years Ari's sets have progressed to accent diversity of track
selection and variety of mixing techniques. Expect to get a proper taste
of psytekk,
progressive and full-on, all in a building blend of positive dancefloor
energy to get your smile & groove on.

Malachi - Goahead - Akron/Cleveland

Treasurer’s office and District Attorney’s Office – in conjunction 
with Animal Friends, the Animal Rescue League of Western Pennsylvania, 
and the Humane Society of Western Pennsylvania.

This event will include performances by a dance group called Nu Spin, 
music by Kaleo and Disco Dan, a performance by The Bastard Sons of 
Magdalene featuring Lexa Russelle, and a dance party featuring DJ 
Sensitive. There will be art on display by Johnross of New York City and 
Mark Murdzak, voted "Best Visual Artist" in Pittsburgh 2001 by the INPGH 
2001 Readers Polls. Featured local designer labels will include 
iroNiece, JDY, Spoonfed, Focal Point, N‘Dogo, Immaculata, and guest 
designer WE Are TECH by Chelsea Snyder of San Fransisco. Featured 
stylists include Aimee McWhorter-Compton and Regina Wilderman of Salon 
Nuvo. There will be a Chinese auction for pet related and other donated 
items, to benefit AAARF. Massage by Jessica Proia, M.T. and Stephanie 
Guiffre, L.M.T. will be offered throughout the evening. There will also 
be food and beverage available.

The Jane Doe Project will be held Saturday July 31. Doors will open at 
8:00pm, and the festivities will be continuing until 12:00/12:30am. This 
event will be taking place at The Eye, located at 4814 Penn Ave in

ARTIST BIO ::

Music has always been a big part of Dennis Rodgers life. Always one to 
actively collect whatever sort of music he was feeling at the moment, it 
wasn't until he reluctantly fell upon house music 4 years ago when it 
took over. During the next few years he developed his sound out of the 
now notorious after hour sessions with the rest of the 112 Crew (Bill 
Patrick, Matt Licata and Tom Amoroso).

It is from these sessions where his talent was discovered and the 
bookings began to roll in. Dennis has come up quickly in NYC playing 
along side DJs such as Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, James Zabiela, 
Funk D'Void, Grant Dell, Casa del sol, Jay Tripwire and more. Dennis and 
the 112 crew held a prestigious residency at Arc NYC until its recent 
closing, and are current residents at Fluid in Philadelphia.

Taking influences from DJs such as Tenaglia, Terry Francis, and Ritchie 
Hawtin. Dennis values these influences but strives to push the sound 
forward "I find no reason in recycling what has been done" he says "I 
constantly try to find new music to keep myself interested and therefore 
the crowd." With a respect for the venue and the vibe of the night 
always evident, he finds a way to direct his sounds at the head but move 
the hips. The ability to find completely unique, techy, quirky, deep 
house and techno has become his trademark.

Dennis recently turned his attention to production joining partners 
Hisham Samawi and Brendan Benke as The Dirty Gringos. Their first 
project "Cowbell" has been instantly successful. It's been played by 
Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, Lee Buridge and recently gained the #2 
spot in URB Magazine for Best new track of the WMC 2003.

On the heels of all of this success Dennis looks forward to the future. 
"Everything seems to be falling into place." The music has become a part 
of him and he looks forward to sharing it with who ever will listen.

This is what we bring:

 *  12 separate stages of sound and lighting bliss, brought to you be the
    top promoters and DJs in the midwest
 *  Three full days of camping, over 50 hours of music and access to all
    stages and areas is included in your admission
 *  The debut of the MOAB (Mother Of All Bass) sound system. i-Tech amps,
    custom cabs, and more bass than you can shake a stick at
 *  A Wall of Light, embark on an optical odyssey with 10 VJ eye-spasm
    captains piloting multiple projection screens, argon lazers, and
    intelligent lighting, making your sensory seasick pupils puke pure
    photons of pixelized pleasure
 *  Fully themed activity areas - expect freaks, fire, bouncy things,
    misting/foam tests and much, much more, all included in the price of
    admission
 *  A rain or shine venue. With plenty of capacity indoor and out, you
    can play in the mud or chill on a couch, or play on the couch in the
    mud
 *  A party for charity. As with our events in the past, a portion of the
    profits will benefit charities such as the ACLU of Wisconsin
    Foundation (protecting our right to assemble), Peace Action Wisconsin
    (protecting our right to live without fear), and prostate research
    (protecting the genital areas of you or those close to you). Want to
    see another non-profit charity on the list? Let us know at the door.
 *  Full vending - food, alcohol (for those with IDs), non-alcoholic
    beverages, clothing, toys and more
 *  Camping on Sunday night (why no make it four days?) is optional, if
    you want another day to chill and camp, and is only another $10
    per/person.
 *  Merchandise and music giveaways from Trounce Records, Milwaukee
 *  Voter registration booths from several states and cities
 *  A spectacular, nature-rific campground, with plenty of room to roam
 *  Open turntables. Didn't get a spot on the flyer? Bring your wax
    anyway, and sign up for a slot, or just bring up a demo, and we'll
    keep an eye on you for next year.

This is what you bring:

 *  A canned food donation at the door. As with all of our events, part
    of the price of admission is a non-perishable food donation
 *  A Tent (or a friend with a tent)
 *  Enough food and beverages for the weekend (or some cash - we'll have
    food available for sale)
 *  Leave glass, weapons, drugs and pets (and pets on drugs with weapons)
    at home, but just about anything else is fair game.
 *  Make your site what you want. Bring a couch, a pool table, a pool, a
    sandbox, whatever.
 *  If you need power or water hookups, let us know at the door and we
    can provide it for a small additional charge. We'll be giving away
    free stuff to the most unusual sites.
 *  Respect. For the performers, the venue, the promoters, others around
    you, and yourself.
 *  Yourself. You don't want to miss this.

Saturday, August 7
JOHN HOWARD @Wish
(om, leaf, i-mix, all world, san francisco)
http://www.om-records.com

John Howard is a legend in house music, a reputation that was cemented 
by his mind-blowing, emotionally moving performance at our Summer Series 
last year. A performance so amazing that we had no choice but to bring 
him back! If you missed him the first time around, do what you must to 
make sure you catch him for Round 2.

John started DJing in 1993, during San Francisco’s infamous Summer of 
Love. His first regular appearances were at Groove Kitchen and the 
Boogie Buffet with Mark Farina. Then on to Stompy Stomp, Together with 
Dubtribe, Spundae, and Wicked.

John’s sound is smooth San Fran funk fused with a large dose of Chicago 
style, combined with his own brand of eclectic jazz and Bay Area 
influences. It’s always funky, and it’s always different. In fact, 
after running into John in San Fran this past June, he promised us a 
whole new world of sounds up his sleeve. Never content with the status 
quo, John continues to innovate.

Trevor Lamont – Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands.
He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about the sounds of
house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony Humphies, Lil Louie
Vega, and Frankie Knuckles.
Eventually he got his own tables and decided to take that step on the
other side of the table. Through years of decication and practice to his
form he has made himself into a very accomplished house D.J.
Trevor has traveled all over sharing his unique style of mixing house. His
style is very mix intensive. If you watch him you'll notice that he's
constantly in the mix and that helps to bring about nice textured and
thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets are usually very sexy and
deep. He can pump it up though and has been know to drop the occasional
surprise techno sets.

We are pleased to welcome our friends from berettamusic in Detriot

BACKLASH
Sundays
at the CHURCH

ELECTRO - SYNTH-POP - ALTERNATIVE - CONNIE FUNK
INDUSTRIAL - NO WAVE - ANTI RAVE

and, yes....a bit of house and techno.

The simple premise of this latest incarnation of THE CHURCH is to provide 
a venue for the new electro-alternative sounds that are being, for the 
most part, ignored by Cleveland club nights and parties.

A mash-up of 20 years of musical sub-genres, the sound is as much familiar 
as it is foreign.

Resident DJs are Rob Sherwood, Briri, and Alex Holt. We are also actively 
seeking new, like-minded DJs to add to our line-up. Interested DJs should 
email ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net.

ALL ARE WELCOME, but if you do come to check us out, PLEASE don't come 
expecting The Church of yesteryear. We are re-building Sunday nights 2 
people at a time, and have a long, long way to go.

18 and over - doors at 10pm - FREE ADMISSION before 11pm - $5.00 after

We are trying to put together an email promotion list, so anyone mailing 
us at ElectroBacklash@adelphia.net before Sunday will be placed on the 
guest list for free admission for 2 people on Sunday 18th, April

Hope to see everyone this Sunday

For the party people who refuse to stop at 2am,

The Shadow Lounge hosts a weekly Friday night
afterhours dance party from 2am-5am. If anyone's down
for some latenight dancing to good soulful music (deep
house, nu jazz, funk) come on down for the party. The
vibe is relaxed and intimate. Some couches if you wish
to chill with a brew but the past few weeks have been
folks on the floor bumping 'n' hustling. Last time I
was there, people were on the tables, the bar
counters, shaking bootay, even breakdancing - a real
dance party a la NYC's Body & Soul or Paradise Garage.
Yours truly occasionally appears on the turntables as
does my DJ crew (Technoir Audio) alongside residents
DJ John Ep & Brother Mike. I'll be bringing some funky
disco records tonight, so if anyone wants to stomp
until sunrise....

oh yay...just what we need....2 suck ass corporate conglomerates bent on ruining music now pulling a
voltron to form a  single, larger suck ass conglomerate hell bent on stripping music of all
righteousness, beauty and meaning.

at what point do all these monolithic corporations just become so big and cumbersome that they
collapse and there's nothing left but smoke, ashes and small independent record labels that grow
audiences organically?

Luke Malachi
Goahead Productions

Hamburg based trio Marco Menichelli, Matthias Rumoeller and McCoy have =
been busy touring...

... and producing their fourth album for Spirit Zone Recordings. =
Producing together as S.U.N. Project sin-ce 1995 the former rock band =
turned to psy trance in a big way. Having become scene favourites around =
the globe over the years. Their music never stops kicking up a storm on =
the dancefloor and the famous live acts are delivered with an energetic =
passion for performing.

The experiences from S.U.N. Project's live performances are taken back =
into the studio, directly transformed into new themes and song flows. =
Their new album 'Insectified' consolidates the three musicians as =
experts in their craft, putting together their unique vision of funky, =
instrumental and fully mental floor filler material. The albums' =
collection of rich sound scapes and catching hook lines is packed with =
monumental passages and build ups. Varying acid riffs and funky grooves =
merge with atmospheric pads forming the signature in S.U.N. Project's =
music produced so far. Topping it all off with rockin' electric guitar =
breaks and solos, the production of 'Insectified' expo-ses psy-rock =
fusion in a completely new light.

This album is a must have for all S.U.N. Project fans out there and also =
a perfect addition to any truly rocking party collection. No doubt will =
we be hearing a lot of 'album title' and what is yet to come during one =
of S.U.N. Project's gigs this summer season.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Star Wars Episode III Title

The second movie was perhaps the worst thing I've ever paid to see. 
After walking out half way-ish through, I've never bothered to see the
second half.  I really really liked the first three movies - as did
most people I know - but, ah, you can only piss in the soup so much
before someone notices.

UMMM yeah being part of the "original familey affair crew" that I am I can promise you that  Brian has no intention to throw anymore techno events...ever. Its cool if you want to throw a party but I suggest you do it under a different name. Putting UPS on a flier will not be recieved well by quite a few people, including myself. What we put together back then should remain memories and inspirations for people to learn from, not to try and recreate.

Is Aphro really that rare?  He has repressed his stuff like 10 times over  
the years.

I'm pretty sure I have every Aphro tune ever made, except the sexual  
healing remix.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Anyone Remember?

Not too sure we can't.. was just talking to Ryan about that and we are
thinking of a camping type venue.
Especially since things like Phoenix Rising went so poorly as far as mud and
farmers raping kids for cash.. and since the field day crew is losing its
control each event that gets called field day its seems to be having a
harder and harder time planning in advance.. Hey they want to collaborate on
something here.. oh..opps... thats right UNITY no longer exists in the
scene..its each crew for itself.. The only collaborating I have seen lately
is Goahead and Plate Tech getting together.. way to go guys. ainly I pin
that effort on Luke and the fact that he seems to have it together more than
all other Production crews in Cleveland..

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Anyone Remember?

Two (and who ever it may concern), Good to see you think you can still speak
for the Universal Peace Society.. And in one way you are right.. after
Family Affair three the people that took ahold of the names were idiots..
they tainted the Families name and good nature. We were thinking more along
the lines of the feel and not the name.. we aren't in it for the glory like
most crews more for the vibe. Remember what thats like? and to add to that
the only true Family affair parties were from UPS and the original 10. I
didn't know you wre in on that or weren't you.... if you were then why
aren't you jumping in on the thing.. work with us. And what about brian..
lets get together yeah yeah yeah it could be quite the time and quite the
party.. Bringing back the old skool sht is what this city needs.. these club
venues are starting to make me think all the kids are giving into society
and just becoming alcoholics instead of musicians and open minded world
changing djs. Is any one out there still for making a difference? Still for
Unity? Still for clapping and dancing and making the cops leave because
there is no crime going on.. parties only fear getting shut down so much
these day because everyone knows there 3000x's more drugs there than there
ever usedd to be.. its sad that our music has become some sort of sound
track to a drug deal.. somesort of sound track to getting drunk rather than
the funky body movin' experience it used to be.

under a different name. Putting UPS on a flier will not be recieved well by
quite a few people, including myself. What we put together back then should
remain memories and inspirations for people to learn from, not to try and

recently and and him and I are are talking about getting a somethng together
for next year just to warn you old skool party people ahead of time..
somethinng to look forward to.. keep a look out and beware.. the

on the actual 12" is the Sticky rmx. sticky is the bassline don of 
2-step, or at least he was. he was the man behind "boo!", "dollar 
signs", "tales of the hood", "triplets", "fyrus", etc.  the rmx is 
nice, if i still played 2-step id buy it.

its not necessarily "techno" but its a dance beat and lots of

it seems to have turned up on the US issue as well from what ive 
heard.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Anyone Remember?

look I am stating that brian is UPS and anyone else that uses that name is as you call them idiots. Yes I was a part of the whole thing. And its not the universal peace society, its the Underground Peace Society. Brian Wheeler threw a lot more than just the Family Affair parties though. My point is, you can't go around stealing someone elses company name. That name belongs too Brian and Lee and no one else. They were the ones that planned the events, put up money, booked everybody, ect. There were no ten people, only them and the people that helped out. I help out with every event that they ever threw, thats why I consider myself part of the crew, but I would never, in no way, try to  use that name, it's very disrespectful to alot of people. More power to you if you want to plan something wonderful, good luck, but think up your own production name. Plus, if I were you I wouldn't just jump into some huge event, start small and build up a name, then people will be more inclined
  to join you in your efforts for a larger event. Also its not very nice to bash on people that have worked hard in the past to try and provide you with a good time. It's not thier fault it rained or that the neighbors were slackjawed hillbillies. There is a lot of unity left and a lot of respect out there for the people that bust their asses planning events, it is far from easy.

Subject: {pb-cle} annoying people website

i found this site after finding out that cat stevens wrote 'wild world'
about patti d'arbanville (who seems pretty annoying).  for each person it
lists annoying qualities vs redeeming qualities.  don johnson's only
redeeming quality is that he seduced and had sex with his babysitter when
he was 12.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} UPS/FamilyAffair (was Anyone Remember?)

Okay so if you were part of the original crew.. and may I state for the
record that I was not part of it at all.. than why the unwillingness to
co-op on some old skool production? And why is it that you are speaking on
Brians behalf? Is he part of this list... is he part of the scene in
Cleveland still.. Than what would he care if Underground Peace Society..
which by th way according to RYAN.. was a collective and not Brian or Lee
alone.. matter of fact the UPS and even new people like Digital Bill and
many many many many others wouldn't even be here in the scene now if it
weren't for RYAN! Brian, Lee, and you must be salt because Ryan has the
willingness to look past the crap and start back up what was once a good
thing that should have never died. Why DID it die by the way? And if you are
implying that Ryan is an idiot then let me know. According to him (and I am
not saying he is right).. the other "MEMBERS" of UPS were the ones that let
it get out of their hands and into the hands of people who had no right
using the name.. now one of the original crew wants to restore the ashes and
you are against it? This isn't sounding right.. what happened to UPS and
Family Affair in the first place? What happened to you all being so tight
then all of a sudden splitting up? And to reiterate my point in my last
post.. we never once said that we were going to use the name Family Affair
or UPS in anything anyways.. I simply was talking about a reference to Ryan
and what he had been part of before.. The feel of Family Affair has been my
point all along.. and if you helped with every last and single one of those
shows then youu should know that the meaning behind it all was that it was
about more than a party.. It was the Music.. and thats it. And if Brian and
Lee have a problem with us making reference to Family Affair or UPS in our
advertisments for this not even put together event or in the flyer than have
them call me or write me.. And I will be more than willing to discuss it
with them but you are telling me not to "speak" on behalf of UPS or Family
Affair like I already have or something.. and in doing that you are the one
who sounds like you are speaking on their behalf.. How do you know what
brian or lee will do? Have you even spoken to them? To comment further on
your post below.. no brian and lee were not the only ones to book people for
those parties (according to Ryan). And they made their money back..things
were cheaper then, than they are now. I myself already have a production
company that has been running outside Southwest LA and LBC CA for 5 years
now..'TilDawnProductions...so this is not about a name.. rethink your debate
strategy here man. As far as the whole.. "people" busting their butts to
provide others with a good time thing.. bullshit.. maybe somewhere in the
planning stages of things is this the case but somewhere between planning
and doing there is always the money factor and pride factor.. and when the
events are going on there is always a mess.. things that could have been
done way better had someone used some common sense.. If you want to see
unity.. go to the UK.. 30 plus crews and groups will chip in and have it
together so good that not one person complains about the events.. 10,000+
people show up and not one fucking complaint.. Cleveland crews can hardly
stand eachother much less consider free water or proper handling of parking
or restrooms.. every outdoor event I have scene has either been a disaster
or had some sort of problem with permits, noise, injuries, wig-outs,
bottles, drugs or something.. I would love to see some production that
actually cared about the people coming and having a good time and less about
the damn mixers being the newest coolest ones or the djs being treated like
royalty and getting the drugs they want.. And the help.. well that is
usually the problem.. Voluteers have this " I got a laminent piss on you"
attitude that needs to go... Not saying that the intentions of Matt B. or
anyone else throwing outdoor events isn't pure or good at first but in the
end Cleveland and Ohio and PA for that matter.. the parties suck ass.. the
crews suck... and there is a serious lack of common sense and human decency
which leads to missing the mark.. Now I am sure someone will say " If you
don't like it leave" Or " go to parties somewhere else then" but that is
exactly why the scene here is dying.. we need a " I see what you are saying
and you are right and lets do something about it" attitude back around here
and I am here to say I am the one that won't shut up and won't go away.. I
will put something great together if it is the last thing I do.. And once
you all have been to a real party and feel that bad ass right on funky
groovin make ya wanna hug somebody then jump up and dance vibe back in our
scene at good event then you will know what has been so damn wrong for so
damn long!

> look I am stating that brian is UPS and anyone else that uses that name is
as you call them idiots. Yes I was a part of the whole thing. And its not
the universal peace society, its the Underground Peace Society. Brian
Wheeler threw a lot more than just the Family Affair parties though. My
point is, you can't go around stealing someone elses company name. That name
belongs too Brian and Lee and no one else. They were the ones that planned
the events, put up money, booked everybody, ect. There were no ten people,
only them and the people that helped out. I help out with every event that
they ever threw, thats why I consider myself part of the crew, but I would
never, in no way, try to  use that name, it's very disrespectful to alot of
people. More power to you if you want to plan something wonderful, good
luck, but think up your own production name. Plus, if I were you I wouldn't
just jump into some huge event, start small and build up a name, then people
will be more inclined
>   to join you in your efforts for a larger event. Also its not very nice
to bash on people that have worked hard in the past to try and provide you
with a good time. It's not thier fault it rained or that the neighbors were
slackjawed hillbillies. There is a lot of unity left and a lot of respect
out there for the people that bust their asses planning events, it is far
from easy.

>no comment about how the white man crackerified reggae?

its funny. in reggae it seems like only the white people who 
REALLY feel the shit get popular. you look at people like ub-40, 
sublime, the guy who owns blood and fire, etc. those guys are so 
down its crazy. even weak ass snow, if you watch the jamaican 
flick "Kla$h", heads were going nuts for him. too weird.

There are two kinds of people in this scene.

a)  People who do stuff.  Every weekend.  Who play records.  Every =
weekend.  Promote shows.  Every weekend. Go out.  Every weekend. Support =
as much as they can.  Every weekend.=20

b)  People who sit around and complain about how it used to be (Stuck in =
the past).  Every weekend.   People who find fault with anyone actually =
doing stuff.  Every weekend (Jealous Bitches).   People who start hate =
campaigns to build themselves up (Slimewads).  Every weekend.  People =
who don't go to any events other than ones they throw (and call people =
hypocrites because no one attends theirs).  Every weekend.

Reading your posts, Deep, there is a lot negativety from people actually =
DOING stuff.  I don't, however, think this is coming from you since you =
are a pretty postive guy.

Bottom line, is that Underground Peace Society WAS Brian Wheeler and he =
is the ONLY one with the right to use that name again.  =20

I would ask yourself if the person feeding you information belongs in =
group a or group b.  =20

Personally I think if all those people in Group B were to disappear =
completely, then the scene would build.  Disinformation and Hate =
Campaigns are what broke down issues of unity... and the "haters" plant =
their seeds of disinformation and cause miscommunication between group a =
and the masses.=20

The end of the Earth is upon us, pretty soon it will all turn to dust.  =
So get up, forget the past.  Go outside and have a blast!

you are
  implying that Ryan is an idiot then let me know. According to him (and =
I am
  not saying he is right).. the other "MEMBERS" of UPS were the ones =
that let
  it get out of their hands and into the hands of people who had no =
right
  using the name.. now one of the original crew wants to restore the =
ashes and
  you are against it? This isn't sounding right.. what happened to UPS =
and
  Family Affair in the first place? What happened to you all being so =
tight
  then all of a sudden splitting up? And to reiterate my point in my =
last
  post.. we never once said that we were going to use the name Family =
Affair
  or UPS in anything anyways.. I simply was talking about a reference to =
Ryan
  and what he had been part of before.. The feel of Family Affair has =
been my
  point all along.. and if you helped with every last and single one of =
those
  shows then youu should know that the meaning behind it all was that it =
was
  about more than a party.. It was the Music.. and thats it. And if =
Brian and
  Lee have a problem with us making reference to Family Affair or UPS in =
our
  advertisments for this not even put together event or in the flyer =
than have
  them call me or write me.. And I will be more than willing to discuss =
it
  with them but you are telling me not to "speak" on behalf of UPS or =
Family
  Affair like I already have or something.. and in doing that you are =
the one
  who sounds like you are speaking on their behalf.. How do you know =
what
  brian or lee will do? Have you even spoken to them? To comment further =
on
  your post below.. no brian and lee were not the only ones to book =
people for
  those parties (according to Ryan). And they made their money =
back..things
  were cheaper then, than they are now. I myself already have a =
production
  company that has been running outside Southwest LA and LBC CA for 5 =
years
  now..'TilDawnProductions...so this is not about a name.. rethink your =
debate
  strategy here man. As far as the whole.. "people" busting their butts =

  provide others with a good time thing.. bullshit.. maybe somewhere in =
the
  planning stages of things is this the case but somewhere between =
planning
  and doing there is always the money factor and pride factor.. and when =
the
  events are going on there is always a mess.. things that could have =
been
  done way better had someone used some common sense.. If you want to =
see
  unity.. go to the UK.. 30 plus crews and groups will chip in and have =
it
  together so good that not one person complains about the events.. =
10,000+
  people show up and not one fucking complaint.. Cleveland crews can =
hardly
  stand eachother much less consider free water or proper handling of =
parking
  or restrooms.. every outdoor event I have scene has either been a =
disaster
  or had some sort of problem with permits, noise, injuries, wig-outs,
  bottles, drugs or something.. I would love to see some production that
  actually cared about the people coming and having a good time and less =
about
  the damn mixers being the newest coolest ones or the djs being treated =
like
  royalty and getting the drugs they want.. And the help.. well that is
  usually the problem.. Voluteers have this " I got a laminent piss on =
you"
  attitude that needs to go... Not saying that the intentions of Matt B. =
or
  anyone else throwing outdoor events isn't pure or good at first but in =
the
  end Cleveland and Ohio and PA for that matter.. the parties suck ass.. =
the
  crews suck... and there is a serious lack of common sense and human =
decency
  which leads to missing the mark.. Now I am sure someone will say " If =
you
  don't like it leave" Or " go to parties somewhere else then" but that =
is
  exactly why the scene here is dying.. we need a " I see what you are =
saying
  and you are right and lets do something about it" attitude back around =
here
  and I am here to say I am the one that won't shut up and won't go =
away.. I

Do i know it all? NO!
But i do know this:
A.  Ups was just Brian and Lee. Not ten guys i promise you.....
B.  I know this cause i helped brian set up his first party almost 5-6 years earlier.
C. They broke up not cause the scene died, but a kid died at FA5 then brian  got  robbed    by gun point, and could not pay anyone so he ended up lookin shadie.  Or something close to that.
D. Be nice to Matt B he is the man!  
E. Dont use there name or idea (be original)
F.  You type long posts.  Slim it down i do not want to read an essay.
D. Use spell check.  It helps.
   thats my two cents worth
           skillz

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} UPS/FamilyAffair (was Anyone Remember?)

ok so I was under the assumption that you were going use the name "Family Affair" Or the production company name "underground peace society" to throw a party. I am all about you anybody trying to make the scene better. the UPS thing was a collective of people, but Brian and Lee were UPS. The reason that Brian quit throwing parties was because some poor kid drowned at the last one. (I know it was during my set) As far as breaking even went.....no I do believe that both of them lost out on a lot of money over the years, Although I didn't ask.
I don't think I called anyone an idiot, I am all for a kick ass party. I did however state that using someone elses name is in bad taste and frowned upon. I am not sure I even know ryan, but the names belong to brian and lee.
I am not trying to argue with you Jason, I am just stating a fact. Please throw a huge outdoor event, help us all bring back the scene. All the other promoters I have seen start out small and work their way up. Brians first thing he ever did was called Unity, it was a small club, then the attic (the best thing ever!!) than a small party at a roller rink (the name eludes me), then soul reception, ect...... I am talking like three or four years before Family Affair.
Dont be upset if no other companies want to help out on your first event in Ohio, you gotta build up the clout and what not. You are right about every event having problems, that kind of thing happens.

>" If you don't like it leave" Or " go to parties somewhere else then"< If you think you can do better than please do it, I really do wish you the best, I'll be there. Hell I'll even play if you want. I just wanted to clear up what I was saying so I was not misunderstood.

yah the attic was the shit.  That kind of thing is impossible in this day
and age.  It was so new for the area in those days it turned a lot of people
on to "this new thing" or whatever.

The scene is losing all the "slack" that just wanted to kick it, do drugs
and be cool. In the process of gaining all of those people in the first
place we lost the impact and it became a "spring break mtv crowd"

And thats ok too.  The only constant is change.  The scene is dying across
the entire country.  No one offs, field days, ups, spontaneous or the entire
electronic music scene is going to be able to recreate what was already
done.

I'd keep the email lists to themselves, that's a fer sher. The 
calendars, on the other hand, you can get kind of creative with, should 
the DB backend be implimented. I'd love to go to the ROM page, type in 
my ZIP code, and just get everything within 50 miles of me in the next 
three weeks, or subscribe to said info as RDL feed or a periodic email.

For me, going to Pittsburgh regularly is kind of unrealistic, but 
Cleveland is an hour and a half less away, ya know? On the same hand, 
Bloomington (MMM. IU hottness), is about the same distance as 
Pittsburgh, and I've played there.

What the hell, I've got DBDesigner open now, XML and data to follow in a 
few days. Sounds like excellent hangover therapy.

pfft, dbdesigner.  just do them by hand on scraps of paper with 
little lines drawn to each other.  In actuality, I make mine just 
using notepad and listing all the stuff for the tables and moving 
things around as I need.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} UPS/FamilyAffair (was Anyone Remember?)

Boy I really opened up a can of worms on this one.. After readin the posts
in reply.. I would guess I only have one thing left to say. I'M Sorry! I am
just an ignorant guy who wants more than anything to have been a bigger part
of all that old skool..shit and to make it all happen again.. I am sorry.
Reading the posts I did just made me realize why I am struggling so hard for
all this crap that "Ryan" was feeding me.. obviously he is full of shit and
DOUG he is in the wrong group like you said... truth is My grandmother is
dying and I am a little over a week clean off drugs for the first time in
like 10 years.. and I am mad at myself for missing out on all the cool
things I could have been a part of.. and as far as the things I was a part
of.. I don't remember half of it because I was such a dope head/ drug
addict... again.. I guess I just am trying too fantisize too much and "make
up for lost time" forgive me and thanks for the feedback..everyone.. I hope
one day I do get my shit together enough to throw a good party or at least
dj one... The ideas that Ryan fed me I was just fast to believe in because
right now I am down and out with the feeling that I have spent 27 years of
life doing nothing of meaning.. but it did mean alot to me that you all
could respond so fairly.. and thank you dan (skillz) and frank (two) for
being so honest... Doug.. thanks so much.. not only forr being honest but
for saying that you see me as a positive person that ment a lot to me right
now in a time when I feel like I have nothing left.. I feel like shit for
dragging up all this past stuff.. again... I'm sorry!
