SOUL GENERATIONS - 9/29/95 - Lakewood, OH
-----------------------------------------

Jinx calls me @ noon (way b4 when i usually get up) & asks if i
could drive him to pick up the turntables @ the Literary Cafe.
After picking up the tables we headed out to the Phantasy, where
the sound & light crew were waiting to get their stuff inside. Dj
Sparx wuz there along w/ my buddy Nick (who i had just called the
night b4), and the investors were there to also help set up.
afterwards i dropped off Sparx & drove back to Cleveland to run 
some errands. 

The errands took longer than i thought & by the time Lisa & i 
arrived @ the party it wuz already midnight. Due to problems that
a previous party (cough, RUMBLE, cough!) had given the space, Jinx
had to pay extra for the location and on top of that he also had
to give up $2 / a head. as a result the flyer discount was not
taken @ the door. even so they still lost money due to a poor
turnout. This may have been due to the fact that the voice mail
filled up & kids couldn’t get directions to the space or cuz some
local kids (cough, Spawntaneous, cough!) were banned cuz of a
previous party (altho Gank that wascally wabbit still snuck in) 
or cuz UNITY wuz going on the same night in pittsburgh. btw could
someone post a review of that party, like to know how that went. 

Welp the 1st person to greet me on the way in wuz steve bevilacqua
who wuz werkin the flying lemur stand. he wuzn’t able to sell the
herbal bliss anymore but wuz still sellin their shirts. i told him
how i had to call the Cloud 9 guy the night b4 2 inform him that
yes it is illegal to sell herbal ecstacy in Ohio now. bummer 2 cuz
i really wanted 2 try their new formula, couldve saved me all
those trips to the alcohol bar. altho it wuz conveniantly located
by Dan the man Spams art stand. The more intoxicated i got, the
more those mutated dolls looked like: Chuckie, i m yur friend to
the end hidy ho!

The party had all the proper ingredients: nice loud sound system,
striking light system, a phat dance space. The party wuz located 
@ the Phantasy Theatre, a concert hall. Only thing is that since
it wuz @ a concert hall there were rows of seats.  And when there
are seats, kids are more apt to sit than dance. Oddessy spun his
canook jungle set to an empty floor cuz all the kids were sitting
in the bleachers. Sparx wuz able to lift a few bench warmers off
their asses w/ his hard acid style. but the jungle ignorant
cleveland crowd dispersed again when old skoolah Scorpion took the
throne. even the mad mixin skillz of Titonton wuz unable to raise
the Thieveland dead. pity those pitt kids didnt arrive sooner cuz
atleast they could’ve showed all the cleveland kids how 2 get down
2 jungle! Than  Synapse jumped on and sparked some life to the
dancefloor by giving them a dose of what they wanted: good ole
hard house! and soon the lonely modern dance chick that occupied
the center of the dancefloor the whole night wuz surrounded by a
bunch of boppin alien ravah types. even ole stevie t got off his
wheelchair! unfortunately the old fool wore himself out & wuznt
able to dance much when the dj he wuz really waitin 4 got on.
sorry Astroboy yur musik wuz da bomb, my body wuznt. but atleast
it gave me some time 2 recover 4 the highlight of the evening:
Jinx on 4 turntables! fello senior citizen, Casey gave me a pep
talk & soon i wuz throwin down moves i didnt know i still had in
me. it wuz obvious this wuz the set that everybody wuz waiting for
cuz when i went on stage to snap a picture i noticed just about
everybody had gotten off their seats & wuz dancing! it wuz the
most beautiful thing i saw that entire night. kids appreciated 
the fact that Jinx tried his best to throw a decent party but just
lacked the numbers that night. this is how partys in ohio have
been going lately, theyre not as massive, but they do have alot
of heart. and when Jinx shorted the system at the end of his set,
kids applauded him for his efforts. this is what its about kids. 
Jinx encored by spinning a few extra minutes, but he had 
pretty much worn everybody out by then. 

After that i had to go cuz Lisa wuz buggin me that she wuz tired.
after i dropped her & Casey off i went back to take Jinx home.
Jinx decided he would stay in Lakewood that night, but i ended
up taking Astroboy to his brothers apartment on the west side.
btw 4 all u trainspotters here’s the best time 2 ask DJs what
they were spinning - when yur giving them a ride home.

GENERIC PARTY - 9/30/95 - Akron, OHIO
-------------------------------------

Welp we missed the art opening cuz i got an unexpected call from
Jill to pick up the st.louis djs from the airport. so after i
picked up my buddy Nick we went to the airport to pick up Dj Jeff
Feller & Dj Noah. they turn out to be pretty kewl kats, but some
pretty strange demands: a six of Bud & a six of Mickeys @ the
local beverage stand, taco bell, & some uhm other stuff.

the party wuz held @ a virgin space: a car dealership, even had 
the big cheesy sign w/ the arrow out front that read: AAAA,
GENERIC PARTY. the building had nice smooth floors, but it wuz
a bit dusty & had some puddles @ spots. speaker stacks were
nice & large. matt did a decent job w/ the lights & even manned
the beverage bar in the back 4 awhile. loft upstairs & locker room 
downstairs provided kewl chill out spaces. and going along w/
AAAA tradition there wuz one stanky, unisexed bathroom, which i
visted quite a few times that night cuz i had so much of Noah’s beer.

ah yaz da muzik: 

* missed Oddessy
* X-on wuz the 1st set i caught - didnt recognize him (1st time i 
  seen him w/o shorts), finally gave him a PLRM. oh yeah i guess
  he had a nice set, but i wuz too busy socializin. 
* Synapse - hi nrg set, 1st to really get the dancers on the 
  floor, def the hometown favorite. 
* Rage - 1st dj to utilize all three table. the set all the other   
  djs gathered around to watch spin. lotsa Reiforce Rekkids. 
  hard acid climax of the night.
* Jeff Feller - mellower housey stuff, i think this wuz when Nick
  made me take him to get something to eat @ Ralleys
* Gank - damnit this wuz the set i wuz waitin 4 (gank is my local
  fav), but Chip from Eyegasm showed up & i had to interview him
  4 the zine. even outside could hear the thumpin hard acid from
  kevins set.
* Noah - Surprise set of the night. they really shouldve switched
  him w/ Jeff. nobody knew this kid wuz this good. he started w/
  some smooth ambient & w/in 5 minutes he got going w/ some hard
  jungle than it wuz happy hardcwoh than he mellowed it out again
  w/ some gaia ambient stuff, then drum & bass, etc. this kid
  wuz a mixin, dancin machine. i thought carlos got into it, this
  kid is even more energetic! too bad most kids had left by then,
  
other highlights of the night: seein x-on, natalie, dave, & the
rest of the pitt crew again. chattin w/ ole friends, drinking & 
sharing all of jeff & noahs beer, getting dragged around by 
Lauren the 40oz chick (she just puts a smile on my face every time
i see her), watchin kurt & bobby dance, checkin out the lights w/
chips 3D glasses.

is there any chance that either conscious or free too will be rescheduled to
saturday?
they are both on friday and it is a tough decision to make if you can only
go to one or the other.
free too's got the atmosphere and it will be legendary, but i don't know if
it is worth the trip for only 3 hours (not counting pre-party).

love,
ryu

I've seen all the posts about this weekend in Pittsburgh. I'm kinda 
skeptical about the scheduling of these events. 3 raves in Pittsburgh on 
the same night? 1st of all does the 'burgh have a large enough following 
to support this type of saturation?  Pittsburgh has 2 Free events to 
choose from and Conciousness which does cost some money. I hope that 
skywalker and sillyboy do not lose because of the other 2 free events.
Or maybe in the month I've been gone Pittsburgh has BLOWN UP!!!

Hopefully the later is true

Well to of the events are really the same event, and one starts at about the 
same time as the other ends ...

ie Free Too and the event at the Strip bar.

I do believe it does, bro.  The 'burgh is packed with ravers, they just 
don't come out much during the day.

Most likely the latter /is/ true.  I've been gone for a couple of months, 
and the scene has grown, I think.

since there has been some confusion about this event, i thought i'd share 
what i know.

i talked to terrence dixon tonight, he's the promoter.  the lineup which 
robert smith posted is correct, and to restate it it's basically this:

oct 13: 
jeff mills/robert hood/dave clarke/ectomorph LIVE
oct 14: 
model 500 LIVE/juan atkins/dave clarke/d wynn/kevin saundrson/eddie fowlkes

i know i forgot a few, mike huckaby's in there somewhere...but ANYWAY...

the party will only have a capacity of 1500, and tickets WILL sell out.  
you have to call the number to reserve tickets if need be, and they'll be 
at recordtime.  unfortunately i forgot to axe da man how much they 
were...(*bonk*) but i'll post as soon as i find out.

the space is LEGAL, and terrence has assured me that everything 
has been secured.  so despite detroit's recent bad reputation for party 
busts, this will NOT get busted.  not to mention that terrence was the 
one who threw BERLIN 1 at a time when detroit was going through a similar 
party withdrawal.

lessee..anything else?  uh, expect everyone and their brother to be 
there...including a possible cameo by dego and mark mac (and if you dont 
know who THEY are then you arent cool:)).

and of course,  expect da ele mentals to be there in full force.

i'll post more as soon as i know...

(fixer, feel free to fwd this to relevant lists...)

Hmm..   Im sure the event will go over well, but you shouldn't assure
everyone that nothing will happen. You are not the Detroit Police or God.
(or are you:)?
And, Nancy and I have worked with Terrance before.  He ripped us off.

There has been some talk that Jeff Mills may not be there.  I just
talked to Juan, and he needs to confirm if Jeff will be or will not
be.  When he calls me back, I'll let you all know.

Either way, I'm flying in to Toledo on Friday.  Ed Luna, anyone going
to be passing through Toledo around 8pm?

I'd appreciate someone posting the Record Time number or other info for
reserving tickets.  I'm coming in from Portland, Oregon (well, 50% chance
at this point given work pressure) and would hate to arrive without a
ticket!

pre-party to the "main event" Id luv the help!  The free bus
back to campus can get me home...

    As a carless raver, I was psyched to hear that there would be
transpo to this rave; where I'm from, it's tough getting rides. The

Pitt. If you know where they're at, please let me know; my address is

    The pre party at the Strip was mostly phat.  A little crowded and
somewhat cliquey, but nice to be that close to the DJ's.  Nice place,
anyhow.  They all spun good sets.

    Free II is a different story.  Once I got in there, I was loving the
lights and the sound and the people, but not the lack of space - it was
too damn crowded.  And it was only three hours :(.  There were also some
VERY un-ravey people there, like twelve-year olds and the like.  Didn't
like the line one bit.  That's the problem with an "approved" rave like
this - fire codes and stupid rules.  Oh well.  The sound kept cutting
out for some reason, which was kind of annoying.

    Didn't go to Consciousness, though I wish I did.

i'll start with free too:

    this was a very inspirational event for me...comparable to tunnel
vision.   why?  there were so many "Non ravers" there that were totally into
the music being spun.  i knew there'd be alot of youngins there and i was
curious of how they'd react to jungle.  i'll tell you this...there were more
people dancing to ruffian and diesel boys sets on friday night than i've
seen since tunnel vision.  really.  this was all new to these people.  they
reacted in the most honest ways to the music.  not worried about impressing
others, they did what came natural.  hopefully some of these positive vibe
flowing kids will show their faces at the more underground raves.  the next
generation of ravers?
      the sound system was deffinately week.  it did cut out occasionally
(when the amp fuse blew out).  but this didn't distract from the vibe.  the
people just jumped higher when the sound came back on!  big ups to udg and
bigger ups to the suits at the science center for allowing this to go on.
their contribution to the scene will not be forgotten.

and now onto consciousness:
      prayers to skywalker and silly boy.  what could have been a great rave
was doomed because there was hardly 75 people there.  nobody was dancing.
i only stayed until 1.5 then left for free too.  the sound rocked.  the
lights were good too.  maybe in the future more care will be given to
scheduling opposing events.
that's it.

love,
ryu

Yeah seeing as how I spun at one party (Consciousness) and attended the
others (Static, the Free II pre-party) and Free II, I think I can post a
review. First off, let me just say that Friday night is almost a blur, it
is hard to put it into words but I'll try. Imagine this, a city on a
Friday night. Loads of kids all geared up for several parties.
Intellabeams set up outside several museums and centers and shooting into
the clear night sky. Shuttle busses running between parties as well as
museums and a general festive mood all around. That was the atmosphere
friday night. 

Date: Friday 10-6-95
Place: Pittsburgh, PA

Time: 10:00pm

After Charly and I left my house and nearly got run down by a wild police
chase of a stolen car on my street we were on our way to Consciousness. As
it turned out it was at City Limits. We rolled into the lot and we
realized right away something was wrong . There weren't alot of cars. I
had suspected it was because it was still early. We parked and went
inside. Inside was one of the LOUDEST booming sound systems ever put
together in Pittsburgh and one almost as loud one in the back room. I
located the promoter found out I was due to spin next and started to get
ready. I spun a set of hard fast house, happy hardcore and a lickle bit of
jungle thrown in for good measure. The people that WERE there seemed to
enjoy it and when I was finished I noticed there were quite a few more
people who had come in. I figured we'd stick around and see how it went.
Well in short it didn't. By the time 12:30am rolled in there still weren't
that many people there. This despite there being an absolutely killer
sound system and a pretty fair assortment of Intellabeams, goldscans and
dataflash strobes going. The place looked empty and the vibe felt just as
empty so we decided to head to Static Aleph Productions pre-party at the
Strip Bar Cafe downtown. 

Time: 12:45

A short 15 minute parkway trip and we were downtown in the Strip at The
Strip Bar Cafe. I look out the window and the sidewalk is filled with 
people. 

All along the street there are people getting out of their cars. Just as I
suspected: massive amounts of people. There were about twice to three
times as many people at the Static than at Consciousness. I could hear
some banging jungle spilling out onto the street so you know what my next
move was. After making my way through the crowd of friends I found my way
inside. As it turned out it was a man like Kaos spinning and several
dancers were brockin' out in what little space was available. I joined
them. At some point Kaos looked up and called me over to talk. He then
held up his dubplate that he had just finished making and told me he was
going to put it on and he wanted to know what I thought of it. It was a
very atmospheric tune. It had a nice build and when the Amen came in the
track became absolutely tearin'. Nice work! I hope I'll be able to get a
copy of it on some label soon. 

Time: 1:35

People slowly started making their way to Free II, the Carnegie Science
Centre party in celebration of The Carnegie Museums (2nd Largest Museum in
the US) 100th year aniversary. There were free shuttles running from
Static as well as from Oakland and a shuttle running from the Strip Bar to
Conciousness. So I and a friend of mine, Michkela (how ya doin?) and her
friends board a shuttle and in 5 short minutes we are outside the CSC. 

Time: 1:40

Outside Free II there were a TON of people. We saw a queue that spilled
out the door down the sidewalk and into the street. There must have been
several thousand, no doubt due to the TV commercials, radio commercials
and newspaper ads that had been running g for a week before. Once inside we
realized the line went up 3 levels and was 1.5 hours long. We didn't know
what to make of this but we kept walking and I guess they let us pass
because I had a crate of records. We got to the 4th floor as as it turned
out the rave was in the Works Science Hall, a place I always thought
would be EXCELLENT to throw a party in. 

To those of you who have never been to the CSC this is the place where
they have one of the phatest lasers in Pittsburgh as well as one of those
Huge Tesla Coils that shoots lightning all over the place. We enter and we
see all forms of kaos. TONS of people dancing. Several on top of the
platforms. The whole room was moving to DJ Ruffian. Now I have to admit I
wasn't quite sure what to expect. I mean with an event this size and as
above-ground and mainstream as this I thought there'd be a bunch of drunk
frat boys going, "Play sum Pearl Jam dude!". But it was NOT LIKE THAT AT
ALL. In fact when I first entered I noticed alot of smiles and people
seriously having it blowing whistles, etc. I even saw a Dr. Seuss hat,
talk about a blast from the past.  People who had never been to a rave
before but had some clue what they were about. The funniest thing was at
one point it seemed like all the ravers I knew were just standing around
on the sides against the wall watching these people.  And here I had
thought it would have been just the opposite ie: non-ravers just staring
at the ravers. 

Eventually even these people were jumping around as Ruffian switched from
Acid to Jungle. People were still comming in despite the room being at
capacity and there wasn't alot of room to dance but everyone made the best
of it. It's now about 2:30 or 3am and dieselBoy goes on and begins to take
the room to another level. People who I am SURE had never heard Babylon
and his other tracks were whooping it up, whistles and disco calls all
around. He put on one track which sampled Dr Dre's "Keep Your Heads
Ringing " and the place absolutely WENT OFF! His set was not without
difficulty however. Through no fault of his own the sound system lost all
treble and midrange. At first we thought the speakers blew but as it
turned out just the fuses blew. A quick replacement and it was back up at
full strength. All in all his set was THE BUSINESS! Next up was Dust who
spun a really good set, much better than the one at Consciousness and then
Smoov who also spun a wicked set of acidic digi-funk. At some point some
people into Miami Bass began rapping over Smoov's set in the back and they
were smiling and nodding so they obviously were having it in their own
way. It was a good party unfortunately several hundred people never got to
see it, because the line didn't get much shorter throughout the night due
to the limited space available. 


Some afterthoughts:

All and all I think this party was a much needed shot in the arm to the
scene here. The fact that The Carnegie CALLED UnDerGround Productions, Inc
and asked them to throw a rave should not go unrecognized. I think UDG Inc
has now achieved "Ultraworld Status" around these parts. They can do no
wrong. Also I think the fact that this UnDerGround party was pretty above
ground shouldn't go un-noticed. So much to the debate of what would happen
if raves suddenly became mainstream. It happened. There was no disaster
and infact I heard from several people that they had wanted to go to a
rave for along time but they had never knew where they were or how to find
one. Those new people that just discovered the scene were having a ball
and I think many of those people would ha NEVER found out about a rave
were it not for the publicity this one received in advance. Also they WERE
ALL DANCING. You know there is a a problem of stagnation in our scene when
for "ravers" its no longer cool to dance but new people come into it with
100% enthusiasm and dance all night. 

As I said, the newbies were having it hardcore. If this is what a well
produced and promoted party can do then I hope there are many more of them. 

I stand vindicated in the whole mainstream vs. underground argument. I
believe the fear of raves going mainstream have more to do with snobbiness
and fear that the rampant and plentiful use of drugs won't be as rampant
and plentiful. We as ravers pretend not to have any sort of cliques but
really underneath the surface it lurks.  Its quite easy to talk about how
unified and great we are when you are basically talking about the same
basic socio-economic group going to parties every weekend. This party was
different: 

1) It was the most diverse I've seen round here to date. There were ALL
KINDS of people there in strength, not just one here, two there. This no 
doubt was due to the party's afordable price: Free! 

2) The people didn't care about "looking like a raver". How could they? 
Most didn't know what a raver looked like. (Takes me back to 92!) 

3) The people genuinely tried it out with an open mind and I only caught
bad vibes from 3 people. 2 of them were "ravers". That ought to tell you
something. 

4) Security was extremely well behaved for such a massive crowd of people in 
such a nice space. I didn't see one incident of abuse of power. 


Other extras, the Rangos Omnimax theatre was open all night showing laser
shows and films. The Little Science Theatre was open all night show lots
of old sci-fi films, all the exhibits and areas of the Science Centre were
open for exploration as many did and the whole kaboodal was absolutely
free of charge! This Sunday's Pittsburgh Post-Gazette estimates that some
20,000 people attended the Carnegie Science Centre this past weekend days.
I'd imagine at least a 3rd of that was there for the rave on Friday night
judging from the crowd. 

Basically it was an excellent party which I believe will bode well for the
proposal to do a rave at the Three Rivers Arts festival next year.
Imagine, raving at The Point under an open sky with the full support of
the City of Pittsburgh!? It could happen folks.


It seems that UDG Inc has it together in a way that many other crews who
try to do massive events don't. One need only too look at Skywalker &
Sillyboy's party Consciousness the same night. Even though many people (I
included) warned them at least a month ago NOT to throw a $15 a/$18 d
party the same night as a free party in such a unique space they decided
to go on with it. Despite the phat lineup, sound and lighting there was
hardly anyone there. I suggested he lower the price since he admitted he'd
loose money but I don't think he really thought no-one would go. Lets hope
they've learned enough from Atlantis and Consciousness to throw a really
pucca party. As they say, 3rd time is a charm. 

All and all I am really happy about the scene here in Pittsburgh right
now. Between the parties, the UDG zine, the good PR, and Free Radio
Pittsburgh (yeah, da Pirate Style) I think this winter and next spring are
going to be the most active winter and spring we've had to date. Lets
hope the weather stays mild. Rumor has it some big things are being
planned. And don't forget about the all jungle party that is being 
planned for December. It should be very basic and small but vibey. Ala 
Champion Sound.

Well thats about it. I didn't make it to the afterparty, nor did I go back
to Consciousness so if anyone did feel free to post. 

Shouts out to dieselBoy, John, Ryan and Lenny of UDG. Charley and
SnapCracklePop Productions, Opus and Aleph Productions, The City of
Pittsburgh and most of all Bigup The Carnegie for having the foresight and
guts to do it all. Free II lived up to the hype and was indeed "the most
technologically advanced entertainment in the most technologically
advanced facility in Pittsburgh."

Well folks I am in a bit of a jam. I am supposed to perform at Bassrush 
II this Saturday in Baltimore but I have no ride at the moment. So you 
know the deal:


If you can bring me and some of my gear (small enough to fit in a trunk) 
then you get:

Approriate money for gas + tolls
A dinner
Some cool mixtapes to listen to on the way down and back
Lively and fun conversation on a variety of topics
An Airhorn to blast in the jungle room
My everlasting thanks

not bad eh?

Here's the catch. I need to leave from Pittsburgh and arrive in Baltimore 
before 8pm Saturday and I'd kinda like to stay for the whole party (as I 
am sure you will want to too). Other than that that's basically it.

If you can hook me up with such a ride then let me know ASAP as I am 
running out of options.

eencapsulated, bleary-eyed, just got back, decided not to but broke down
and went ahead and posted review...

lots of mud.
long wait to get in.
Karl K rocks.
dieselBoy rocks.
crazy house circle, crazy dance moves that i'm practicing right now.
lots of mud.
beautiful people i hadn't seen in ages (you know who you are).
beautiful people i had never seen before, but met (you know who you are).
lots of mud.
beautiful people i had never seen before, and didn't meet (you probably
don't know who you are).
lots of mud.
Feelgood (Feelgod) blows up the spot in the main room.  
Amazingly (or maybe not so), Scott Henry matches this feat.  these two
are responsible for the 4 minutes of agony when i tried to get out of
the car after the trip back and my hamstrings (both sides) locked up
like a bank vault.  MAJOR cramps.  but it was worth it.
lots of mud.

didn't make the net meet...i was the black kid w/blond/orange hair, blue
and white striped shirt, adidas that used to be black but are now
brrrrown.  cause of lots of mud.

goodnite,

here's my lil ole review:

we arrived in baltimore at like 4pm, cause we (da people i was wid) wanted
to do tha tourist thing. We called up Modern Musiz, but they would not give us
directions unless they saw the tickets (which we had purshased in da burgh).
After havin lunch, and looking round the inner harbor for a bit, we decide to 
go get directions. hehe ... it took us like 30mins to find O'Donalds ave. ...
no one in bmore would give us consise directions ;(

We arrived at the spot at like 11:45, waited in tha car for like 1.5hrs before 
getting in (would rather wait in the car, listening to some pleasent music, 
then outside in the cold rain like i did before purple). Once we got in, and 
parked, we looked around the space for a while. Main/tekno barn (room  or
whutever), had some kick ass lights/ lasers (thou u couldn't really make dem 
out agains the back wall cause of the light comin up from da venders area).
I think Bones was spinnin when we can in. We decided to check out some of the 
other area's, though so i really didn't get a chance to listen to him. The 
Jungle barn wass pretty empty, plent of room to move, 'cept in the front where
everyone was watchin the DJ and MC. I didn't go into tha house barn all that
much, cince i don't really care for house. I spent most of the nite in the 
tekno barn, cause i liked the music in there the bestest. Clarkee was pretty
nice, he played some hardcore, and i like dat :) ... Micro (?) was  also kick 
ass. db's set was nice, but early on, one of his rekkids seemed to be
skippin, and that was a bit annoying. 

Besides alot of people outsidem the vide seemed to be very nice. I got given 
candy from three people (a now & later, twizzler and piece of bubble tape) and
gave out a fair share of blow pops. Everyone seemed to be smilling (at least 
inside the barns where i could see them (or maybe they just liked my hat;) ). 
Much different from the NYC scene (this is only my third party outside
da 5 burrows).

Met a few Net Ravers (who's names i do not remember ;( ).

ps. i was the guy in the "Cat in the Hat" hat, blinking lite, pumpkin 
reflector round my neck, and a backpak on my back.

"Music is prophecy. Its styles..are ahead of the rest of
society because it explores, much faster than material
reality can, the entire range of possibilities..it makes
audible the new world that will gradually become visible,
that will impose itself and regulate the order of things;
it is not only the image of things, but the transcending
of the every day, the herald of the future."
    - jacques Attali, NOISE: The Political Economy of Music
      quoted from the music section of the Star Wars exhibit

welp here's my soopah belated review of bassrush 2:

4am saturday morning realize its impossible to finish the zine and
go to bed, very dissapointed with myself.    

10am saturday morning get up to pick up the rental car before the
place closes @ noon.

12:30 pm mary calls & informs me she might not be able to go cuz
her boss wants her to work tomorrow. i inform her i just dropped
$150 cash for deposit on the rental which i've already picked up
plus the rental car dealership has already closed. she sez she'll
call me back. in the mean time i start making phone calls to see
who else would want to go.

1:30 pm mary calls & suggests we go to the detroit party. i told
her i didn't mind & that i wuz able to get two of my friends to
go: brian and mandy.  she sez might be able to convince her boss
to let her have sunday off, but we would figure out which party 
we would go to when we got to columbus.

2:00 pm brian calls & sez he can't get off work and no one knows
where mandy went. i start making phone calls again to find
replacements.

3:00 pm convince sam aka dj jinx and jinny to go by pretty much
offering them a free ride.

3:30 pm pick up sam in shaker heights

4:00 pm pick up jinny in ohio city

4:30 pm leave for columbus after bullshitting at jinny's place  

5:30 pm i get pulled over for speeding (76 in a 65 - lame). i tell
the cop i just got a speeding ticket (which wuz the truth). i count
my lucky stars when he lets me go.

7:00 pm arrive in columbus at mary's place. we help her move a
sofa out of her apartment - her friend bought it off her. had
some pizza there. and wuz still not sure which party we should
go to. at one point we were gonna go down to cinci for BRING
THE NOISE, but when we called the info # there were no direx,
so we gave up on that idea. finally we sed fukit let's just go
to baltimore!

8:30 pm we leave mary's place to go to the idiot boy so jinx
can pick something up there.

9:00 pm we leave columbus.

4:00 am we arrive in baltimore at the site averaging 75 mph.
some kids from virginia are stuck in the parking lot cuz their
car battery died. my friends wonder why when i offer to jump
their car. they don't realize i wuz in the same situation at
IO2. 

4:15 am we still weren't able to get their car started, so we
gave up & headed into the party.

4:15 am we enter the main room. micro is spinning. i snap a
pic of the crowd. then i snap a pic of micro. we hang out up
front for awhile bullshittin w/ baggadonuts then decide to go
check the rest of the music. we make our way to the back making
sure not to step on members of the blanket posse. it wuz ruff
cuz it was so packed. i don't think i've seen so many kids 
packed so tight in a warehouse since GRAND.

'god damn, there's more mud here than o-hi-o.' i guess we
were lucky we missed the rain, but we still got to experience
all that beautiful mud! 

trekked into the house room. the center of the dance floor
wuz completely dominated by the dance circle. we walked right
by it & headed straight for the dj booth - we wuz here 4 the
muzik. caught the end of o'keefe's set. than o'sheen & m-gee
started their 3 hour tag team set. i watched them spin as
jinx & mary bullshitted w/ the dj's and raymond. always business
b4 pleasure for them. me i wuz dancin, but i think kids thought
i wuz wack since i wuz dancing facing the music instead of the 
dance circle.

bumped into adam the only netter i got to talk to @ the party!  
it really bums me out to know all u netters were there @ the
party & i didn't get to meet any of u! i guess it wuz my fault
for missing both net meets. but i just got this funny feeling
y'all saw me, but didn't come up to me. i wuz the kid w/ the
black 'zett' visor.

that's another thing, i totally felt like john massive @ FA,
surrounded by kids w/ too much attitude & drugs instead of kids
w/ friendly vibes & smiles. granted this may be due to the fact
that i know just about all the kids at the local partys, but its
very difficult to spread postive vibes when all yur getting are
cold stares going 'who does this kid think he is.' that's the
other thing i wuz a bit shocked with. the ability for kids to
totally talk shit about u right in front of yur face! wow! 

i think adam wuz the only kid who greeted me w/ a smile aside
from people i knew. next time i see out of town kids @ the local
partys i'm gonna hafta make sure to greet them w/ a smile & make
them feel @ home especially after they've come all that distance
to come to yur party. i think that's the least i could do. hell
if i wuz the promotor i would let all the out of staters in for
free cuz i know they've already spent a shit load of money & time
just getting to the party.

next we headed into the jungle room. nice big circle in there.
walked right by it & headed straight for the musik. dj trace
wuz spinning when we got there. there wuz also some mc that
wuz holding a 40oz, but nobody seemed to know his name. jinx
wuz chattin w/ joe while me, mary, & jinny wondered when we
could go back to the main room. i wanted to ask joe who the mc
wuz, but he split b4 i could ask him. yo joe what up w/ the 'tude?

after that it wuz back into the main room. this time we decided
to hang out in the back where there wuz a little bit more space.
bullshitted w/ jj @ the delirium booth for awhile & bought a 
SHO tape - had to after hearing his phenominal set @ IO2. SHO is
da midwest mac! some damn good driving music that mixed tape 
provided after the party too.

jinx wuz itching to get back into the house room, so it wuz back
out into the mud! o'sheen & m-gee were still tag teaming when we
got back in. watched m-gee trainwreck a few mixes, but they were
barely noticeable. plus the dancers could care less they too busy
throwing down in the circle. some kat w/ dreads wuz dominatin the
center. i wuz surprised his best move wuz a variation of the RSC
1990's x-cept he added hitchkicks while he wuz in his handstand.
i'll give him his props he wuz very good. for some reason in 
baltimore where u'll find some of the best dancers in the world,
i find it difficult to dance. mebbe that's the reason i'm too
busy watching other kids dance than to concentrate on my own        
dancing. gotta give some props the st.louis dancers were there
in full effect too. 

oh wait there wuz one girl from baltimore that greeted me w/ a
smile - Ava / Elektrika Star!  hadn't seen that girl since 
SOUL RECEPTION. that girl just gets cuter everytime i see her.

went back in the main room for Feelgood and then Scott Henry.
odd part about scott's set wuz he seemed like he wuz just
spinning records than actually mixing them. perhaps he wuz 
afraid of the problems micro encountered w/ the needles or
something, but he just didn't seem as daring as i've seen 
him b4. nevertheless his set wuz def the set of the night,
of course this may be due to the fact we didn't get to the
party 'til 4am, but gotta give props to the main man!

9am we were all getting way too tired from the long drive
there plus we had to drive another 7 hours back, so we decided
to leave. anyone know how the afterhours wuz?

parting thoughts..bummed i didn't get the zine done. bummed we
got there so late. bummed i missed Bones. bummed i missed Clarkee
(altho by strange twist of fate i ended up catching him here
in cleveland when he spun here in cleveland the next night). bummed
i didn't dance too much (too busy watching the other dancers).
bummed i broke a vow i had kept for three months 4 staying clean
(its jinx's fault). didn't deserve the shirt i wuz wearing, which
is why i kept my jacket zipped up most of the night. i think adam
or ava deserves it.

oh well back to work on the zine...

I haven't done the Ohio one for quite a while since I thought zerozero was
gonna do the pb/cle ROM.  Plus I haven't been to a party in a quite a while,
and I haven't about anything new coming up.  Hopefully I'll make it to
Rebirth II, should be a good party, and its in the same cool spot as the
original Rebirth.

    Date: Sun, 22 Oct

    
            Hey there y'all!
    
            Just thought i'd mention that i've come across the Celestine
    Prophecy (it's a book, some may even call it new age *yikes!* definitely
    worth reading though) Home Page. (Now isnt' that amazing grammatical
    structure for a University Grad? haha)
            It's at :
                    http://koa.ifa.hawaii.edu/user/shaw/celes/celestine.html
    
            i know that there are a few people on this list that are down with
    J.R. ;) and for those who haven't read the book, take a look at these
    pages, the concepts, IMHO, are very rave related.  I think the HoloDynamic
    Unity thing that is part of this site is especially cool.
            later ravers,
                    brad

there yet..but hey it was early!  we hung out ofr a while and just 
chilled cause i was waiting for terry to come on woo woo!  hmm the crowd

everyone was dancing and having a great time which is somthing i like to 
notice! the music was loud but just right! and i was all smiles hehe  hmm 
lets see hmm i think micro came on next ( i think) and he sewt was really 
good too! i enjoyed the whole everning! the attitudes werent real bad 
either everyone seemed happy and smiling and dancing  so i think thats a 
plus!  i had a little talk (well it seemed liked forever but any) with 
astroboy and he seemed like he was having a good time tioo!  
	i guess the dj that suprisaed me was rob paine!  i really really 
really loved his set!  it was great! i totally cant described it but 
thats my fault hehe i danced my butt off while he was on!  woo woo! ;)  
hmm anyway i guess thats it..i had a great time oh  and sleepy c and 
astroboy at tthe end were awesome too i was ust so tired at that point 
all i could do was listen!  but they did a great job tag teaming! :)

sorry.. zero cant save you.. i hate to say it :(

ijoe used to go around and get the rave flyers and shit like that.. i 
cant do it... i was just confused.. i thought people sent the shit to me 
and i just formatted it all to fit into the rom. i was wrong.. i 
didn't/dont know what im doing so i guess someone with a car and nota 
shitload of homework will have to do this. 

sorry to let you all down.

> sorry.. zero cant save you.. i hate to say it :(

so does anyone who goes to events and gets fliers, etc. want to do the 
ROM?  or is pb-cle going to die?

ps- the web site is gone right now... i'm not going to do any work on it 
until I see it would be worth something to someone.
