             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Saturday October 3rd, 2009
Akron Ohio


B. RICH
(Palms Out Sounds, [Only registered and activated users can see links. 
], Party Like US, Household Management)
Pittsburgh, Pa

B. Rich (aka Barrett Richards) is one of America's welcome purveyors of 
bass-heavy house music. With nearly a decade of DJ and producing 
experience within a rave scene that has come and gone, he has positioned 
himself nicely into house music and dropped like a bomb. He was 
influenced at a young age by early hip hop and old school rave such as 
Moby and has crafted a unique sound that is becoming internationally 
recognized. His sets are known to fly all over the map, between electro 
house, bassline, baltimore breaks, old skool dance and dubstep all with 
a unifying element: huge low end frequencies. When behind the tables he 
shows the signs of an artist and performer who truly loves their work. 
Over the past year B. Rich has gained support from top artists such as 
Foamo, AC Slater, Klever, DJ Craze, the Trouble & Bass crew, Heavyfeet, 
Designer Drugs, and many other DJs worldwide. Many of his tracks have 
received repeat BBC Radio 1 plays by Kissy Sell Out and even support 
from the Black Eyed Peas. His recent EP on Palms Out Sounds, "Ain't Here 
To Party", has been making huge waves and getting loads of blog support 
from the tops such as Discodust, Iheartcomix, etc. He is becoming a much 
more sought-after remixer with impressive work already done for top 
labels such as Ministry of Sound, Seclusiasis, Palms Out Sounds, and 
Menu Music. His name has also become a regular chart topper on Beatport 
and other major download sites.


Hired Guns
(M.I.A, Sur America, Combat, New Ascension, B.A.D. Ass.)
Chicago IL / Akron OH

Alfonz De La Mota & MC Infinity make up this new combo set to blaze a 
fire in the dnb scene. Alfonz has been Djing for over 15 years and 
Infinity has been blazing dnb sets since the late 90's. These guys rep 
for one of Americas largest drum n bass collectives the "M.I.A." aka 
Murda In America DnB crew based in Chicago with over 25+ djs across the 
nation and are the embodiment of energy when they perform together. 
Separately they have rocked an impressive string of majorcites all over 
the states including New York, LA, Detroit, Indy, Cinci, Vegas and many 
others. When home in Chicago, Alfonz stays busy holding down the 
funktion sound system once a month at Chicago's legendary club ""Smart 
Bar" for "Big Bass Thursdays". Infinity is based in Ohio and has been 
headlining major events and raves all over at a hectic pace solidifying 
his reputation with every show. Fonz and Infinity both hit the stage 
with the same fervor and professionalism and are aiming to bring this 
electric vibe to a show near you.

//THANK:YOU

Usually I end with a thank you but thought I would start with it this
time. Just wanted to take a moment to thank you all very much for your
support and taking the time to read our newsletters. Please help
spread the word about Experimedia. Every little bit helps us bring you
great music/art.  Ill get some stickers going here soon and start
throwing some in with orders.

Also a little insight to whats behind Experimedia. 100% of Experimedia
is operated by myself with only the kind assistance and support of my
family and great friend/artist Jason Henry (and all our artists of
course too). And like most people working in this community I myself
have a full time day job and a family. This is strictly an operation
of passion and over the years like many of you I have put way more
into it financially than I have received, and that is ok! I am and
always will be dedicated to the music/art and all the wonderful
beautiful people who contribute to this community.  Getting music by
wonderful artists to your wonderful ears is what we're all about.

Also please send us your comments, suggestions, labels/artists you
would like to see us stock, things you love or hate about the site.

Next year is Experimedia's 10 year anniversary and I hope to do some
special things/promos/releases that I am pretty excited about.
Hopefully you will be too.

Ok on with the news!

//NEW.RELEASE

SHINOBU NEMOTO.IMPROVISATIONS #1 (expcd009)
An epic album by Japanese artist Shinobu Nemoto, Improvisations #1
showcases Shinobu's ability to create beautiful and interesting sonic
textures using minimal means.	Using only an electric guitar, stomp
boxes, and recording to a 4-track with no overdubs Improvisations #1
delivers 5 massive pieces.  Recorded in January of 2009 each piece
initially soft and subtle build and layer gradually into powerful and
intense guitar noise drones.
Here for full details, samples, and ordering:
http://experimedia.net
Orders include immediate bonus downloads of the album in highest
quality MP3 and/or lossless FLAC formats so that you may begin to
enjoy the album before your package arrives.

Dubstep BOLD would like to welcome Geochelone and Fazer to the store!

Geochelone hails from South West England, and draws influences from a  
range of things - from standard jump up DnB/Dubstep to 8-bit and  
Glitch Hop. Anything that doesn't sound quite right is usually right.

Fazer is a DnB and Dubstep DJ/Producer from East London. He resides on  
London's infamous Force FM with a weekly Drum n Bass show residency.  
Fazer has been DJing for 9 years and has played many different venues  
with many different names.

This past month, the following tracks have been released on Dubstep  
BOLD:


DSB020: Heider - Tugboat
DSB021: Darkened - Drawn and Quartered
DSB022: Fazer - Rivet City
DSB023: Fazer - Tales of Suspense
DSB024: Geochelone - Nintendo
DSB025: Geochelone - Bugs
DSB026: Heider - Zaubermaus


Octofoil Records, a Washington DC based record label, has released  
Darkened's first full length CD: Flipside. Get your copy now!

Check out the tune everybody has been talking about, Heider's Tugboat,  
on Dubstep BOLD! For a full length preview, check it out on

Subject: {pb-cle} LTJ Bukem + MC Conrad Weds October 14 @ the BBT

For anyone who missed it last year, LTJ Bukem + MC Conrad will be
performing at the BBT next Wednesday, October 14th.  It was absolutely
amazing last year and we are glad to be able to have this happen
again.  We are offering presales to guarantee admission, unfortunately
it sold out last year and we had to turn some people away.  You can
purchase them via paypal via the link on the 412dnb website -
www.412dnb.com

supporting cast will be JTS and Sean Kirby.

Impact Audio will be bringing in a monster sound system as well.

Hope to see some of you there, if this list is still alive!

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
