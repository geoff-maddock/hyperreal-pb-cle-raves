Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Feb 09                    SHUT UP AND DANCE                       Akron

This event is part of the Animation and Gaming Ohio Convention 2008...

Animation and Gaming Ohio is a new type of Convention in which Animation 
and Gaming come together for 48 solid hours of uber craziness. It 
encompasses everything from your favorite anime to your favorite 
childhood cartoon, and your favorite street fighter game to your 
favorite collectible card game. If you can name it, this is the 
convention for them!

The idea to create a convention like Animation and Gaming Ohio came 
shortly after Cleveland's Colossal Convention 2006, in which a popular 
event called "Live Action Gaming" took place. It's creator, Jason 
Taylor, decided that it was high time for a new type of convention to 
arise. With the help of a few friends and the Random Battle Group, new 
ideas were born, and Jason was starting to think that the idea of 
bringing animation and gaming together would be great. Since then, many 
people have come to the helm, including Josh Farley, who is responsible 
for the majority of the advertising for the convention.

We here at Animation and Gaming Ohio (also dubbed "A & G Ohio") invite 
you to come and see exactly what we are all about during the weekend of 
February 8-10, 2008. With a bunch of new panels and some very special 
events, we are sure it would be very well worth your time and money to 
come see a new convention be born. So come, join our forums and post 
what you would like to see! After all, this convention is "by the fans, 
for the fans."

Fri Feb 15               GALACTIC ASSDRAGON CLASSIC              Pittsburgh

This competition is free to enter and anyone with a computer can join.

The rules for this competition are the same as those in the previous 
events (and like before, these rules are likely to be broken by the more 
nefarious combatants). This battle is being fought to see who can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. As a combatant, you can only use a laptop 
or desktop computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no 
traditional instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug 
into the RCA input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount 
of material ahead of time and use any software you want, although you 
are encouraged to improvise or create material on the fly. Using 
material from other artists is grounds for removal (this rule is 
potentially misleading since you can use samples). Like the previous 
battles, this is not a Traktor, mashup, or DJ competition: make your own 
shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many combatants sign-up, 
everyone who enters gets up to 10 minutes to play in the opening round. 
There will be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, 
you can start setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in 
front of you is done, you're on the clock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 
combatants will move on to the semi-final round where they will have 10 
minutes to annihilate their competitors. At the completion of the 
semi-round, the top 2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 
minute shot before one triumphant champion is declared. The winner 
receives the highly coveted Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their 
own 7" record release on No Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the No Room for Talent Records 
camp, dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.


Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you are able to 
transform the crowd into a churning sea of ravenous barbarians. Getting 
the crowd to gently bob their heads isn't worth any points. Breakcore, 
hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise are what's called for. While 
vocals are not explicitly prohibited, may the elder gods devour the 
souls of any who assault the judges with ghastly singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from all the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. The more you distract everyone from your awful music, the 
more points you get. If you look like you're checking your email during 
your lunch break at work, you're going to do terrible.

Joshua's gift for music dates back to his early childhood where his 
unique attention to detail was displayed at the age of 6 when he picked

clarinet and the alto saxophone. It was obvious that this musical 
phenomena was destined for greatness. Falling in love with the EDM scene

the dark sounds of Myth I S Josh gathered an assortment of records and 
began playing house parties in and around the south west ohio area under 
the moniker Oompa Loompa. It is under this name that josh released his 
first of many mix cds "Trance in da pants" which was able to land him a 
few spots on local lineups at EDM events. It was around this time as

Sat Feb 16                     DEREK PLASLAIKO                    Cleveland

$5

Sat Feb 16 2008

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we're finally answering 
your calls. One of the most respected techno acts coming from the US


Derek Plaslakio [Detroit / NYC]
Ghostly International, Wolf + Lamb

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall 
or record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig 
deeper into the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring 
labels, bucking trends and are forever on a quest to find the perfect 
record. The ones that make the staunchest of chin stroking, note taking 
trainspotters lose their shit on the dancefloor, hanging on every record 
from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen 
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7.s, 
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit 
to the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of 
success. He quietly paid his dues on Detroit.s rave circuit, and was a 
crucial piece of the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Analog parties 
of the mid-nineties. He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking 
DJ sets that were clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This 
combination resulted in a residency for Family, the weekly party at 
Detroit.s legendary Motor.

With a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful, 
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; 
sharing the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin 
Saunderson, Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was 
also during that time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at 
the inaugural edition of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit.s 
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T. 
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to 
head east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice 
of the Motor City to the Big Apple.

Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at the Bunker (Subtonic) in 
NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb monthly parties. 
Most recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006 .Best Of. poll 
as New York.s Best Techno DJ.

Sets are available here -> http://plaslaiko.net/me/

Local support from
Jamie Tyler [Tek-Know | Cleveland]
Funk Detective [Tek-Know | Cleveland]

and more TBA!

SinCroNation
Electro House / ACID House
UFO Wrangler, Clock Driven MIDI Conductor, Booty Shaken Beat Dropper
SinCroNation is an Army of Korg Electribes controlled by the hardest 
working slacker on the Detroit Techno Scene. This All Hardware based 
Live PA is about songs that bend and twist into one another. The walls 
shake, the floor rumbles as the Club Sound System is pushed ever so 
gently to its limit and back. SinCroNation takes off for another quick 
trip around the Galaxy.

Sausage Party / Ghoulie / Sex Ghost!
Ghettotech / Sleaze Funk / Polka
Influenced by Mike Oldfeild, Alan Parsons, Tangerine Dream, Kurtis Blow 
and Wesley Willis:
Patrick {Ghoulie} Wenzel, uses Sequencers / Drum Machines and a Mic to 
stir up a funky brooding stew Live. Most beats are lead by bass lines 
and spooky synths w/ crusty funk vocals on top of active percussion. 
Special Guests from guitarists to vocalists help Ghoulie give a wider 
element to music that makes it a tad bit more Live than your standard 
Live PA Set. Wenzel resides in Lansing, MI in some old witch hippie.s 
basement where he studies paranormal activity / writes and records his 
music underground and doesn.t drive a car.

Beats, Breaks, Synths, Samples, Grooves, and Wicker. The Wicker Basket

various venues in Grand Rapids, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Ann Arbor. 
The man wears a basket on his head while dropping esoteric rhythms and 
being described as the "son of Kraftwerk". The Basket's performances 
drift from breakbeat to house, drum and bass and downtempo with an 
overall IDM feel.

Fri Mar 14                      I HATE TECHNO                    Pittsburgh

I HATE TECHNO!!!!!!!

After a long hiatus, Full House Productions is back and proud to 
announce our eighth event here in Pittsburgh, 'I Hate Techno'.

In an on-going effort to expand musical horizons and educate people on 
the music we love so much, we are throwing an event focusing on possibly 
the most important genre of electronic music- techno.

>From acid to Detroit, minimal to tech-house, we have all the bases 
covered to help you explore the different sounds of techno, and 
understand how the sound has evolved and its impact on every genre of 
electronic music.

Our line-up will feature live PAs, as well as 4 DJ's, all right here 
from Pittsburgh.

The full line-up is:

Shawn Rudiman- Live PA/Technoir Audio/7th City Recordings 
(Detroit)/Finest Blend Recordings (Stockholm)/Pittsburgh

Thumptek- Live PA/Iron City Acid/Pittsburgh

Paul Alexander- Humanaut/Pittsburgh

Jason Cuban- Full House/Pittsburgh

Adam Ratana- 412DNB/Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh

Jwan Allen- Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh


'I Hate Techno' will be held Friday, March 14th, 2008.
Doors will open at 10pm and the event will end at 3am.
This will be an 18+ event, and 21+ with ID to drink.
Cost at the door is $10.

This event is being held at the Braddock Elks Lodge, 424 Library Road, 
Braddock, PA. This is a prime location, only about 15 or 20 minutes from 
downtown.

The venue features a stocked bar with drink specials, a kitchen that 
will cook food as late as you can eat it, and has its own parking lot 
around back to save you the hassle of parking.

The Braddock Police Department will be providing an off-duty officer to 
ensure everyone has a safe, drama-free time.

Check Lolli.org as well as MySpace.com/FullHouseProductions for more 
info, and be on the lookout for the flyer which should hit the streets 
in a couple of weeks.

Fri Apr 18                       CANDYBALL 4                            NYC

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

or so planning the lineup and theme for our 2nd Annual Halloween Candy

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Feb 15               GALACTIC ASSDRAGON CLASSIC              Pittsburgh

This competition is free to enter and anyone with a computer can join.

The rules for this competition are the same as those in the previous 
events (and like before, these rules are likely to be broken by the more 
nefarious combatants). This battle is being fought to see who can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. As a combatant, you can only use a laptop 
or desktop computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no 
traditional instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug 
into the RCA input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount 
of material ahead of time and use any software you want, although you 
are encouraged to improvise or create material on the fly. Using 
material from other artists is grounds for removal (this rule is 
potentially misleading since you can use samples). Like the previous 
battles, this is not a Traktor, mashup, or DJ competition: make your own 
shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many combatants sign-up, 
everyone who enters gets up to 10 minutes to play in the opening round. 
There will be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, 
you can start setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in 
front of you is done, you're on the clock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 
combatants will move on to the semi-final round where they will have 10 
minutes to annihilate their competitors. At the completion of the 
semi-round, the top 2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 
minute shot before one triumphant champion is declared. The winner 
receives the highly coveted Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their 
own 7" record release on No Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the No Room for Talent Records 
camp, dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.


Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you are able to 
transform the crowd into a churning sea of ravenous barbarians. Getting 
the crowd to gently bob their heads isn't worth any points. Breakcore, 
hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise are what's called for. While 
vocals are not explicitly prohibited, may the elder gods devour the 
souls of any who assault the judges with ghastly singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from all the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. The more you distract everyone from your awful music, the 
more points you get. If you look like you're checking your email during 
your lunch break at work, you're going to do terrible.

on Keith's Illeven:Eleven Recordings imprint as well. With over 150 
12-inch releases out and four massively-distributed CDs under his belt,

US.

If you know Hytek, you know his passion for electronic music. No matter 
what environment, he relates to everyone listening with various twists. 
When you ask Hytek what style he spins, he answers with Dance Music..he 
is not particular to one style. You can catch him incorporating techno, 
house, progressive, tribal, electro, minimal, breaks, and trance into 
every set..and you would not know the difference.its all dance music to 
him. If you had to categorize it to one sound..you could call it Big 
Room. You can always tell Hytek is on the decks when you hear big room 
build-ups with thumping tribal bass lines. Hytek started dj-ing for his 
friends at house parties back in high school. Eight years later you can 
find him downtown in the city spinning or at any underground event 
happening in the MidWest. Hytek made his mark with the Acomplis 
Productions campouts of 2006 and the Kickback events of 2006 hosted by 
Infared Productions. Now in 2007, Hytek has joined forces with Infared, 
GTP, and Abduction Radio as a resident. Hytek has hosted residencies 
from West Palm Beach, Fl, to his home-Chicago. Expect nothing less than 
remarkable things in the future.

Joshua's gift for music dates back to his early childhood where his 
unique attention to detail was displayed at the age of 6 when he picked 
up a guitar and simply played it after watching his father. His talent 
thus grew later in life with his countless years of work on both the 
clarinet and the alto saxophone. It was obvious that this musical 
phenomena was destined for greatness. Falling in love with the EDM scene 
and music around the mid 2000, Joshua decided to take his musical 
experience to another level. Inspired by the epic sounds of Micro, and 
the dark sounds of Myth I S Josh gathered an assortment of records and 
began playing house parties in and around the south west ohio area under 
the moniker Oompa Loompa. It is under this name that josh released his 
first of many mix cds "Trance in da pants" which was able to land him a 
few spots on local lineups at EDM events. It was around this time as 
well that josh and long time friend and partner Tom Sawyer started 
Airplane Clique productions.

Sat Feb 16                     DEREK PLASLAIKO                    Cleveland

$5

Sat Feb 16 2008

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we're finally answering 
your calls. One of the most respected techno acts coming from the US


Derek Plaslakio [Detroit / NYC]
Ghostly International, Wolf + Lamb

Some people filter through the record bins, taking what are on the wall 
or record store employee suggestions. Then there are people who dig 
deeper into the dusty crates, and absorb music like a sponge; ignoring 
labels, bucking trends and are forever on a quest to find the perfect 
record. The ones that make the staunchest of chin stroking, note taking 
trainspotters lose their shit on the dancefloor, hanging on every record 
from one to the next.

Derek Plaslaiko unquestionably falls into the latter category. As a teen 
equally transfixed by Mojo and Wizard cassettes and Minor Threat 7.s, 
Plaslaiko followed the beats from his hometown 20 miles south of Detroit 
to the epicenter of Detroit techno, then enjoying its third wave of 
success. He quietly paid his dues on Detroit.s rave circuit, and was a 
crucial piece of the puzzle for the legendary Poorboy and Analog parties 
of the mid-nineties. He quickly earned a reputation for forward thinking 
DJ sets that were clinical, sophisticated and extremely sensual. This 
combination resulted in a residency for Family, the weekly party at 
Detroit.s legendary Motor.

With a reputation for high energy sets that were versatile and tasteful, 
Plaslaiko slowly became in demand on the Midwestern club circuit; 
sharing the stage with such techno luminares as John Acquaviva, Kevin 
Saunderson, Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, and Matthew Herbert. It was 
also during that time Plaslaiko was asked by Carl Craig to perform at 
the inaugural edition of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.

In 2003, Plaslaiko became part of the original team of DJs at Detroit.s 
Untitled parties, sharing a residency with Tadd Mullinix (aka James T. 
Cotton), Matthew Dear and Mike Servito. In 2004 he made the decision to 
head east and set up camp in New York City, determined to bring a slice 
of the Motor City to the Big Apple.

Currently, Derek is one of the resident DJs at the Bunker (Subtonic) in 
NYC, as well as an integral part of the Wolf + Lamb monthly parties. 
Most recently, he was honored in the Village Voice 2006 .Best Of. poll 
as New York.s Best Techno DJ.

Sets are available here -> http://plaslaiko.net/me/

Local support from
Jamie Tyler [Tek-Know | Cleveland]
Funk Detective [Tek-Know | Cleveland]

and more TBA!

EZ Sniper has been playing ragga jungle music over the last decade and 
will be bringing some never before played original ragga jungle tunes 
for his second return appearance in Ohio.  He is currently producing 
mashed-up ragga-jungle tunes with serious amen edits, heavy basslines 
and a new school jungle meets old school jungle feel. As a DJ, his sets 
bring a blend of hard, gunman dancehall and ruff ragga-jungle tunes with 
sound clash vibes.  EZ Sniper's label: Lion heart Records is distributed 
worldwide.  New vinyl releases will be available early this year.  Ohio 
be prepared for brand new never before heard dubplates, specials,

up, and ragga, to pure mashed up amen mayhem, he keeps you on your toes 
with anticipation. In one set you will most likely hear a lot of tunes 
that you have never heard before, or have not heard since 1995, quite a 
few original dubplates, and special voicings, as well as some of the

Fri Feb 22                         REFUGE                        Cincinnati

"This little event is aimed at having a couple underused djs (that have 
the ability to keep the pace of the dancefloor and the other heads 
nodding) demonstrate their rocking ability each month. In a quite 
literal sense of underground, "Refuge" will be held in the basement 
level of an establishment that is centrally located minutes from 
clifton/downtown and less than a mile off the Ronald Reagan highway on 
the main strip of Mt. Healthy. There is a full bar with humble prices 
and there will be free CDs from atleast one performer every month. The 
sound will be decent. The goal is to not overpower your thought process 
with clipping and crackling but to have you be able to enjoy and maybe 
punch one another to the music all while being able to communicate 
properly. Basically, this will hopefully provide a tiny haven, if only 
for a few hours, for decent people who enjoy the dirtier side of 
electronic music and the satisfying side of a couple cocktails"

This will be in the "Coach-lite" room of Just One More, a completely 
seperate entity from the upstairs bar, so you don't have to worry about 
"regulars" fussing about the music. It's about a mile off the Mt. 
Healthy/North College Hill exit on Ronald Reagan, and if you're coming 
from Clifton you can just take Ludlow till it turns to Hamilton and 
follow all the way up. There's a parking lot behind the bar as well as 2 
free public parking lots less than a block away. If we get even a 
remotely decent turnout we'll make it a monthly affair with different 
djs we think are capable of making the night enjoyable.

That being said, here are 2 different mixes you can listen to as a taste

Fri Mar 14                      I HATE TECHNO                    Pittsburgh

I HATE TECHNO!!!!!!!

After a long hiatus, Full House Productions is back and proud to 
announce our eighth event here in Pittsburgh, 'I Hate Techno'.

In an on-going effort to expand musical horizons and educate people on 
the music we love so much, we are throwing an event focusing on possibly 
the most important genre of electronic music- techno.

>From acid to Detroit, minimal to tech-house, we have all the bases 
covered to help you explore the different sounds of techno, and 
understand how the sound has evolved and its impact on every genre of 
electronic music.

Our line-up will feature live PAs, as well as 4 DJ's, all right here 
from Pittsburgh.

The full line-up is:

Shawn Rudiman- Live PA/Technoir Audio/7th City Recordings 
(Detroit)/Finest Blend Recordings (Stockholm)/Pittsburgh

Thumptek- Live PA/Iron City Acid/Pittsburgh

Paul Alexander- Humanaut/Pittsburgh

Jason Cuban- Full House/Pittsburgh

Adam Ratana- 412DNB/Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh

Jwan Allen- Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh


'I Hate Techno' will be held Friday, March 14th, 2008.
Doors will open at 10pm and the event will end at 3am.
This will be an 18+ event, and 21+ with ID to drink.
Cost at the door is $10.

This event is being held at the Braddock Elks Lodge, 424 Library Road, 
Braddock, PA. This is a prime location, only about 15 or 20 minutes from 
downtown.

The venue features a stocked bar with drink specials, a kitchen that 
will cook food as late as you can eat it, and has its own parking lot 
around back to save you the hassle of parking.

The Braddock Police Department will be providing an off-duty officer to 
ensure everyone has a safe, drama-free time.

Check Lolli.org as well as MySpace.com/FullHouseProductions for more 
info, and be on the lookout for the flyer which should hit the streets 
in a couple of weeks.

Sat Mar 15                      BLANK ARTISTS                     Cleveland

As part of countinuing effort to bring in some of the biggest names in 
techno along side of some of the fastest rising talents in the game we 
again tap some of our massive regional talet to unleash their sound on 
Cleveland for the first time.

We proudly present:

Blank Artists
[Josh Dahlberg & Drew Pompa]
Blank Artists Website

Josh Dahlberg
Josh Dahlberg spent his awkward teen years in his bedroom with a drum
machine, sampler, and records, only coming out for school, soccer, and
the occasional visit from label mate, and close friend, Josh Cummings.
Despite growing up in a rural Michigan town, Dahlberg kept his ears on
Detroit as a reference point for his creativity. While attending
university in northern Michigan, Josh founded the record label, Blank
Artists. Now based in Detroit, Josh has reached many goals that far
surpass his years. In 2006, Josh worked with one of his oldest . and
most important - influences, Underground Resistance/Submerge at their
famous base camp on Grand Ave., which served as a learning experience
that will impact him forever. As a music producer and DJ, Josh has
shared stage time with some of electronic music's elite - which has
afforded him the privilege of playing shows from New York to
California. With upcoming releases that are sure to please, check out
why XLR8R has called him "a refiner of the Detroit sound...this
breakthrough artist is well on the way to making an impact on dance
music".

Releases:
To Malaysia / D Records / 01.08
RS-232 Poppies Will Make Them Sleep (Josh Dahlberg Remix) / Blank
Artists / 01.08
Summers With Similarities / Gravid Digital / 01.08
Slant State / People Mover / 11.07

Ego/Timid / Blank Artists / 03.07
J. A. Cummings Control Theory (Josh Dahlberg Mix) / Blank Artists / 
01.06


Drew Pompa
Drew Pompa, a.k.a Blank Artists' resident DJ extraordinaire, can
shock, stimulate, and excite all without physical encounters, but
rather by neuron transmitters that convey information through conduit
superhighways of the brain. If this bio is indicative of Drew's
personality, then strap yourself into the mother ship and be prepared
to take a journey to the backwaters of the mind. Throughout the
voyage, you will be presented with an array of dance friendly
electronica, described in the least as being deep, dark, funky,
quirky, yet remaining almost fully embedded within house and techno
sounds. In addition to Drew's passion for spinning records, he is also
a fixture behind the record

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008        HULLA REUNION 2008 *cancelled*               Toronto

***CANCELLED***

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

2008! The club is booked and with most of the planning, for our first 
two parties next year, done and in the books, I can spend the next month 
or so planning the lineup and theme for our 2nd Annual Halloween Candy 
Costume Ball!!!!

I've used max/msp before, it's a pretty amazing piece of software.  I've been eyeing MsPinky for a while, too, but I've never used it.

And, unfortunately, most of my usage of max/msp was for stuff unrelated to music, really.. it was more for interactive art type stuff.

Got a call from one of my buddies over seas about this. I knew it went down
about a month or so ago, but didnt believe it was going to be this serious.
God bless his soul.

Dubai: A famous British disc jockey will spend four years in prison for
bringing in and possessing 2.16 grams of marijuana, a court ruled yesterday.


The Dubai Court of First Instance found the 40-year-old DJ guilty of
bringing in and possessing marijuana for personal use, as charged by the
Public Prosecution.

The accused, who will be deported after serving his term, claimed he was
unaware that he possessed marijuana which was seized from him at Dubai
International Airport.

"I did not know the drugs were in my possession," R.W. told the court
earlier.

Medical reports said tetra-hydro cannabinol, an active component of hashish,
was found in the defendant's urine.

R.W.'s lawyers Mohammad Al Redha and Mohammad Al Suwaidi presented their
defence earlier this month.

The MINIMUM SENTENCE in the UAE for weed is 4 years in prison.  The 
maximum sentence is death.  You can be arrested for trace amounts there, 
so a dirty pipe is enough to get that 4 year sentence.  Having weed in 
your bag plus a THC-positive piss test is pretty much signing your own 
arrest warrant there, which isn't a big secret...

The one thing that kind of really surprises me about this is that the
listing fee for this must be immense!!

Dubai: A famous British disc jockey will spend four years in prison for bringing in and possessing 2.16 grams of marijuana, a court ruled yesterday.  The Dubai Court of First Instance found the 40-year-old DJ guilty of bringing in and possessing marijuana for personal use, as charged by the Public Prosecution. 
 The accused, who will be deported after serving his term, claimed he was unaware that he possessed marijuana which was seized from him at Dubai International Airport.
 "I did not know the drugs were in my possession," R.W. told the court earlier. 
 Medical reports said tetra-hydro cannabinol, an active component of hashish, was found in the defendant's urine. 
 R.W.'s lawyers Mohammad Al Redha and Mohammad Al Suwaidi presented their defence earlier this month.

noted, Ed Rodgers, but i'm still glad someone got this started.  faxed a
letter to an embassy in response to an earlier call for action but i felt
kind of lonely doing it (esp. on doa, lol!).  this felt like i am part of a
community trying to help one of its founders who's in trouble.  mary :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} petition for extradition for grooverider

My thing is, if this guy wanted to make a petition such as you are
taking a stand, he would not have used johnny mcanonymous as his name.

Your personal fax in my opinion will hold more value than 10,000
signatures backing an anonymous leader.

That's all.

Personally I believe in self responsibility.  If I were flying
anywhere, especially internationally, I would expect that minimizing
personal risk were at the head of my priorities.  I hold no one
responsible for this except grooverider.

I don't buy that he didn't know he was possessing it.

He's representing a music genre, he should be held to a higher
standard, not made exceptions for.

This is exactly why electronic music will continually be stereotyped
as laden with drug use.

fine with me, Ed Rodgers.  i'm just trying to help get word out in case
someone wants to try to do something for him.  i believe in
self-responsibility as well, but i've made some stupid mistakes myself and
it's been a blessing when peeps have had compassion.  btw, i don't
necessarily think he should be held to a higher standard (but that's
because a long-time music writer once told me he didn't think it was fair
to hold musicians to a higher standard - they're just human beings like the
rest of us, so i've been thinking about that for a long time).  not arguing
with you.  i respect your opinion.  just wanted to try to to help get word
out, that's all.  take care, mary :)

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Feb 22                         REFUGE                        Cincinnati

"This little event is aimed at having a couple underused djs (that have 
the ability to keep the pace of the dancefloor and the other heads 
nodding) demonstrate their rocking ability each month. In a quite 
literal sense of underground, "Refuge" will be held in the basement 
level of an establishment that is centrally located minutes from 
clifton/downtown and less than a mile off the Ronald Reagan highway on 
the main strip of Mt. Healthy. There is a full bar with humble prices 
and there will be free CDs from atleast one performer every month. The 
sound will be decent. The goal is to not overpower your thought process 
with clipping and crackling but to have you be able to enjoy and maybe 
punch one another to the music all while being able to communicate 
properly. Basically, this will hopefully provide a tiny haven, if only 
for a few hours, for decent people who enjoy the dirtier side of 
electronic music and the satisfying side of a couple cocktails"

This will be in the "Coach-lite" room of Just One More, a completely 
seperate entity from the upstairs bar, so you don't have to worry about 
"regulars" fussing about the music. It's about a mile off the Mt. 
Healthy/North College Hill exit on Ronald Reagan, and if you're coming 
from Clifton you can just take Ludlow till it turns to Hamilton and 
follow all the way up. There's a parking lot behind the bar as well as 2 
free public parking lots less than a block away. If we get even a 
remotely decent turnout we'll make it a monthly affair with different 
djs we think are capable of making the night enjoyable.

That being said, here are 2 different mixes you can listen to as a taste 
of what to expect from me:

UFO Wrangler, Clock Driven MIDI Conductor, Booty Shaken Beat Dropper
SinCroNation is an Army of Korg Electribes controlled by the hardest 
working slacker on the Detroit Techno Scene. This All Hardware based 
Live PA is about songs that bend and twist into one another. The walls 
shake, the floor rumbles as the Club Sound System is pushed ever so 
gently to its limit and back. SinCroNation takes off for another quick 
trip around the Galaxy.

Sausage Party / Ghoulie / Sex Ghost!
Ghettotech / Sleaze Funk / Polka
Influenced by Mike Oldfeild, Alan Parsons, Tangerine Dream, Kurtis Blow 
and Wesley Willis:
Patrick {Ghoulie} Wenzel, uses Sequencers / Drum Machines and a Mic to 
stir up a funky brooding stew Live. Most beats are lead by bass lines 
and spooky synths w/ crusty funk vocals on top of active percussion. 
Special Guests from guitarists to vocalists help Ghoulie give a wider 
element to music that makes it a tad bit more Live than your standard 
Live PA Set. Wenzel resides in Lansing, MI in some old witch hippie.s 
basement where he studies paranormal activity / writes and records his 
music underground and doesn.t drive a car.

Wicker Basket: Grand Rapids, MI

Beats, Breaks, Synths, Samples, Grooves, and Wicker. The Wicker Basket

The man wears a basket on his head while dropping esoteric rhythms and 
being described as the "son of Kraftwerk". The Basket's performances 
drift from breakbeat to house, drum and bass and downtempo with an 
overall IDM feel.

Fri Mar 14                      I HATE TECHNO                    Pittsburgh

I HATE TECHNO!!!!!!!

After a long hiatus, Full House Productions is back and proud to 
announce our eighth event here in Pittsburgh, 'I Hate Techno'.

In an on-going effort to expand musical horizons and educate people on 
the music we love so much, we are throwing an event focusing on possibly 
the most important genre of electronic music- techno.

>From acid to Detroit, minimal to tech-house, we have all the bases 
covered to help you explore the different sounds of techno, and 
understand how the sound has evolved and its impact on every genre of 
electronic music.

Our line-up will feature live PAs, as well as 4 DJ's, all right here 
from Pittsburgh.

The full line-up is:

Shawn Rudiman- Live PA/Technoir Audio/7th City Recordings 
(Detroit)/Finest Blend Recordings (Stockholm)/Pittsburgh

Thumptek- Live PA/Iron City Acid/Pittsburgh

Paul Alexander- Humanaut/Pittsburgh

Jason Cuban- Full House/Pittsburgh

Adam Ratana- 412DNB/Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh

Jwan Allen- Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh


'I Hate Techno' will be held Friday, March 14th, 2008.
Doors will open at 10pm and the event will end at 3am.
This will be an 18+ event, and 21+ with ID to drink.
Cost at the door is $10.

This event is being held at the Braddock Elks Lodge, 424 Library Road, 
Braddock, PA. This is a prime location, only about 15 or 20 minutes from 
downtown.

The venue features a stocked bar with drink specials, a kitchen that 
will cook food as late as you can eat it, and has its own parking lot 
around back to save you the hassle of parking.

The Braddock Police Department will be providing an off-duty officer to 
ensure everyone has a safe, drama-free time.

Check Lolli.org as well as MySpace.com/FullHouseProductions for more 
info, and be on the lookout for the flyer which should hit the streets 
in a couple of weeks.

Sat Mar 15                      BLANK ARTISTS                     Cleveland

As part of countinuing effort to bring in some of the biggest names in 
techno along side of some of the fastest rising talents in the game we 
again tap some of our massive regional talet to unleash their sound on 
Cleveland for the first time.

We proudly present:

Blank Artists
[Josh Dahlberg & Drew Pompa]
Blank Artists Website

Josh Dahlberg
Josh Dahlberg spent his awkward teen years in his bedroom with a drum
machine, sampler, and records, only coming out for school, soccer, and
the occasional visit from label mate, and close friend, Josh Cummings.
Despite growing up in a rural Michigan town, Dahlberg kept his ears on
Detroit as a reference point for his creativity. While attending
university in northern Michigan, Josh founded the record label, Blank
Artists. Now based in Detroit, Josh has reached many goals that far
surpass his years. In 2006, Josh worked with one of his oldest . and
most important - influences, Underground Resistance/Submerge at their
famous base camp on Grand Ave., which served as a learning experience
that will impact him forever. As a music producer and DJ, Josh has
shared stage time with some of electronic music's elite - which has
afforded him the privilege of playing shows from New York to
California. With upcoming releases that are sure to please, check out
why XLR8R has called him "a refiner of the Detroit sound...this
breakthrough artist is well on the way to making an impact on dance
music".

Releases:
To Malaysia / D Records / 01.08
RS-232 Poppies Will Make Them Sleep (Josh Dahlberg Remix) / Blank
Artists / 01.08
Summers With Similarities / Gravid Digital / 01.08
Slant State / People Mover / 11.07
Points Of Contention / Blank Artists / 07.07
Robert Barrett Pocket Full Of Empty (Who JD Mix) / Blank Artists / 07.07
Ego/Timid / Blank Artists / 03.07
J. A. Cummings Control Theory (Josh Dahlberg Mix) / Blank Artists / 
01.06


Drew Pompa
Drew Pompa, a.k.a Blank Artists' resident DJ extraordinaire, can
shock, stimulate, and excite all without physical encounters, but
rather by neuron transmitters that convey information through conduit
superhighways of the brain. If this bio is indicative of Drew's
personality, then strap yourself into the mother ship and be prepared
to take a journey to the backwaters of the mind. Throughout the
voyage, you will be presented with an array of dance friendly
electronica, described in the least as being deep, dark, funky,
quirky, yet remaining almost fully embedded within house and techno
sounds. In addition to Drew's passion for spinning records, he is also
a fixture behind the record

Fri Apr 18                       CANDYBALL 4                            NYC

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008        HULLA REUNION 2008 *cancelled*               Toronto

***CANCELLED***

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

"LEGALIZE IT! WOOO!"
and
"THERE [sic] GOVT IS WRONG!"

Yeah, something tells me that petition isn't going to change anyone's mind

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} petition for extradition for grooverider

Dear Ed Rogders,
You're a nice guy, Ed Rodgers.

Ed Rodgers, you know what I like to put on my french fries? Ed Rodgers!

I'm going to replace random nouns in my speech pattern with "Ed
Rodgers" because it sounds way cooler.

I'm up out this Ed Rodgers.

Sincerely,
Ed Rodgers

Dear Ed Rogders,<br>
You&#39;re a nice guy, Ed Rodgers.<br>
<br>
Ed Rodgers, you know what I like to put on my french fries? Ed Rodgers!<br>
<br>
I&#39;m going to replace random nouns in my speech pattern with &quot;Ed<br>

I&#39;m up out this Ed Rodgers.<br>

&gt; &gt; fine with me, Ed Rodgers. &nbsp;i&#39;m just trying to help get word out in case<br>

&gt; &nbsp;&gt; self-responsibility as well, but i&#39;ve made some stupid mistakes myself and<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; it&#39;s been a blessing when peeps have had compassion. &nbsp;btw, i don&#39;t<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; necessarily think he should be held to a higher standard (but that&#39;s<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; because a long-time music writer once told me he didn&#39;t think it was fair<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; to hold musicians to a higher standard - they&#39;re just human beings like the<br>
&gt; &nbsp;&gt; rest of us, so i&#39;ve been thinking about that for a long time). &nbsp;not arguing<br>

&gt; &nbsp;&gt; &lt; My thing is, if this guy wanted to make a petition such as you are<br>

&gt; &nbsp;&gt; Personally I believe in self responsibility. &nbsp;If I were flying<br>

&gt; &nbsp;&gt; He&#39;s representing a music genre, he should be held to a higher<br>

And when justice is gone, there's always force."

Blind faith in bad leadership is not "Patriotism".

"bigot propaganda"?  We are at war with Islam.  This arrest is a good  
example of WHY we are at war with them (this and the terrorism).  If  
England had any balls, they would go break Grooverider out and bomb the  
shit of Dubai.

Just think, Dubai is one of the so-called "moderate" Muslim countries...

'Bigot propaganda' is a bit much, Mark; Mark has a point Entropy.

We are at war with fundamentalist Muslims, not Islam.  Islamic zealots and distorted ideals are at least partially to blame.

The other part of the blame lies with misguided anger and resentment from Muslims who are pissed off about 'Western ideas' being introduced into what THEY consider 'their world.'  Plus that thing about deciding to turn 'Palestine' into 'Israel' way way back in 1948, before ALL of us on this list were born.  And the subsequent war in '67 in which 'Israel' expanded its borders to include much of the West Bank.  The Islamic world views the Americans and British as the creators, catalysts and enablers of Israel in many facets. 

Dubai, and the UAE as a whole... is considered a moderate Muslim country.  Yet, their laws are (as we have seen in this instance) quite backward.  So what else is new?  We as Americans, Britons, and general Westerners can do nothing to change their laws.  Thats just that.  I pray for Grooverider.  I hope he can make it through what is sure to be a stint of pure hell in his life.

But I am not one to blindly blame Islam itself.  And neither should you, Entropy.

Just think, Dubai is one of the so-called "moderate" Muslim countries...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} petition for extradition for grooverider

When we lived in Washington state, our neighbor was Muslim. Her parents
raised her and her sisters to believe that education was the best way to
be a success in the world, and she had her MBA. She also ran her own
little farm raising free-range animals and organic vegetables. She was an
extremely nice lady, and it used to upset her that portrayals of her
fellow Muslims in the news always made them out to be a bunch of
terrorists, as well as being people who were against women's rights or
education.

You, sir, simply propagate the same ignorance that she detested.

While we're on the subject of "bad religions," I sure hate how *all
Christians* like to bomb abortion clinics...

Nonsense.

If what you say is true, then where is this "vast majority" of Muslims  
speaking out against the "radical minority"?

Answer:  There isn't one.

In WWII, we were at war with Japan.  That doesn't mean we were at war with  
EVERY SINGLE JAPANESE PERSON EVER, it meant we were at war with Imperial  
Japan as a whole.  Right now, we are not at war with EVERY SINGLE MUSLIM  
EVER, but we are at war with Islam as a whole.  Japan at the time was  
imperialists, and Islam is terrorizing.  We were at war with the army of  
Japan, an we are now at war with the active terrorists of Islam.  Were  
there Japanese people who didn't agree with Japan's motives and ideals?   
Probably, but no one ever heard from them, because they were a very very  
small minority.  The same is true for Islam.

I dont think theyre a very small minority(the dissenters), I think theyre many...

a very, very oppressed many.

Its against their interests to show any sympathy for the U.S.  Not only could their government imprison them, but they could be ostracized from their communities as well.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

SinCroNation
Electro House / ACID House
UFO Wrangler, Clock Driven MIDI Conductor, Booty Shaken Beat Dropper
SinCroNation is an Army of Korg Electribes controlled by the hardest 
working slacker on the Detroit Techno Scene. This All Hardware based 
Live PA is about songs that bend and twist into one another. The walls 
shake, the floor rumbles as the Club Sound System is pushed ever so 
gently to its limit and back. SinCroNation takes off for another quick 
trip around the Galaxy.

Sausage Party / Ghoulie / Sex Ghost!
Ghettotech / Sleaze Funk / Polka
Influenced by Mike Oldfeild, Alan Parsons, Tangerine Dream, Kurtis Blow 
and Wesley Willis:
Patrick {Ghoulie} Wenzel, uses Sequencers / Drum Machines and a Mic to 
stir up a funky brooding stew Live. Most beats are lead by bass lines 
and spooky synths w/ crusty funk vocals on top of active percussion. 
Special Guests from guitarists to vocalists help Ghoulie give a wider 
element to music that makes it a tad bit more Live than your standard 
Live PA Set. Wenzel resides in Lansing, MI in some old witch hippie.s 
basement where he studies paranormal activity / writes and records his 
music underground and doesn.t drive a car.

Wicker Basket: Grand Rapids, MI
IDM / Breakbeat / House
Beats, Breaks, Synths, Samples, Grooves, and Wicker. The Wicker Basket 
calls on various sources to create a unique sound. He has performed at 
various venues in Grand Rapids, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Ann Arbor. 
The man wears a basket on his head while dropping esoteric rhythms and 
being described as the "son of Kraftwerk". The Basket's performances 
drift from breakbeat to house, drum and bass and downtempo with an 
overall IDM feel.

Fri Mar 14                      I HATE TECHNO                    Pittsburgh

I HATE TECHNO!!!!!!!

After a long hiatus, Full House Productions is back and proud to 
announce our eighth event here in Pittsburgh, 'I Hate Techno'.

In an on-going effort to expand musical horizons and educate people on 
the music we love so much, we are throwing an event focusing on possibly 
the most important genre of electronic music- techno.

>From acid to Detroit, minimal to tech-house, we have all the bases 
covered to help you explore the different sounds of techno, and 
understand how the sound has evolved and its impact on every genre of 
electronic music.

Our line-up will feature live PAs, as well as 4 DJ's, all right here 
from Pittsburgh.

The full line-up is:

Shawn Rudiman- Live PA/Technoir Audio/7th City Recordings 
(Detroit)/Finest Blend Recordings (Stockholm)/Pittsburgh

Thumptek- Live PA/Iron City Acid/Pittsburgh

Paul Alexander- Humanaut/Pittsburgh

Jason Cuban- Full House/Pittsburgh

Adam Ratana- 412DNB/Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh

Jwan Allen- Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh


'I Hate Techno' will be held Friday, March 14th, 2008.
Doors will open at 10pm and the event will end at 3am.
This will be an 18+ event, and 21+ with ID to drink.
Cost at the door is $10.

This event is being held at the Braddock Elks Lodge, 424 Library Road, 
Braddock, PA. This is a prime location, only about 15 or 20 minutes from 
downtown.

The venue features a stocked bar with drink specials, a kitchen that 
will cook food as late as you can eat it, and has its own parking lot 
around back to save you the hassle of parking.

The Braddock Police Department will be providing an off-duty officer to 
ensure everyone has a safe, drama-free time.

Check Lolli.org as well as MySpace.com/FullHouseProductions for more 
info, and be on the lookout for the flyer which should hit the streets 
in a couple of weeks.

Sat Mar 15                      BLANK ARTISTS                     Cleveland

As part of countinuing effort to bring in some of the biggest names in 
techno along side of some of the fastest rising talents in the game we 
again tap some of our massive regional talet to unleash their sound on 
Cleveland for the first time.

We proudly present:

Blank Artists
[Josh Dahlberg & Drew Pompa]
Blank Artists Website

Josh Dahlberg
Josh Dahlberg spent his awkward teen years in his bedroom with a drum
machine, sampler, and records, only coming out for school, soccer, and
the occasional visit from label mate, and close friend, Josh Cummings.
Despite growing up in a rural Michigan town, Dahlberg kept his ears on
Detroit as a reference point for his creativity. While attending
university in northern Michigan, Josh founded the record label, Blank
Artists. Now based in Detroit, Josh has reached many goals that far
surpass his years. In 2006, Josh worked with one of his oldest . and
most important - influences, Underground Resistance/Submerge at their
famous base camp on Grand Ave., which served as a learning experience
that will impact him forever. As a music producer and DJ, Josh has
shared stage time with some of electronic music's elite - which has
afforded him the privilege of playing shows from New York to
California. With upcoming releases that are sure to please, check out
why XLR8R has called him "a refiner of the Detroit sound...this
breakthrough artist is well on the way to making an impact on dance
music".

Releases:
To Malaysia / D Records / 01.08
RS-232 Poppies Will Make Them Sleep (Josh Dahlberg Remix) / Blank
Artists / 01.08
Summers With Similarities / Gravid Digital / 01.08
Slant State / People Mover / 11.07

J. A. Cummings Control Theory (Josh Dahlberg Mix) / Blank Artists / 
01.06


Drew Pompa
Drew Pompa, a.k.a Blank Artists' resident DJ extraordinaire, can
shock, stimulate, and excite all without physical encounters, but
rather by neuron transmitters that convey information through conduit
superhighways of the brain. If this bio is indicative of Drew's
personality, then strap yourself into the mother ship and be prepared
to take a journey to the backwaters of the mind. Throughout the
voyage, you will be presented with an array of dance friendly
electronica, described in the least as being deep, dark, funky,
quirky, yet remaining almost fully embedded within house and techno
sounds. In addition to Drew's passion for spinning records, he is also
a fixture behind the record

and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008        HULLA REUNION 2008 *cancelled*               Toronto

***CANCELLED***

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs
