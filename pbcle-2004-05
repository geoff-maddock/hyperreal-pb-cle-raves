Subject: {pb-cle} June 4 | Bill Patrick (112 Crew, Arc)

FRIDAY, JUNE 4
THE HEADRUSH MUSIC SUMMER SERIES: PART TWO
BILL PATRICK (112 Crew, Arc)

HeadRush Music personally encountered Bill Patrick at The Miami Winter
Music Conference in March 2003. We found Bill on the Terrace at Space.
Playing after banging sets by Mauro Picotto and Marco Carola, we never
thought we'd have the energy to go on. Not only did we stay 'til close,
we would never forget. In fact, Bill's performance that morning remains
one of the best DJ sets we have ever heard.
 
Being resident DJ with legend Danny Tenaglia in New York City would
probably be enough for most DJs. But in less than five years of DJing,
Bill Patrick has played gigs from Mexico City, Costa Rica, Chile, Buenos
Aires, and on to Spain, Italy, England, Finland, Norway, and Germany.
 
He headlined a 3000-person event in Mar Del Plata, Argentina alongside
living legend Ricardo Villalobos. He landed three dream gigs Ibiza,
including a main-floor slot at the legendary "We Love" party at Space,
and two remarkable performances at Circo Loco and at DC-10, which then
landed him gigs at Circo Loco in Rome and Rimini.

No techno DJ's dream would be complete without a set in the legendary
techno club Tresor in Berlin. His dream came true on New Year's Eve
2004. What a night!

It's no wonder he has caught the eye of many world class DJ's such as
Lee Burridge and Danny Howells who mentioned him as "The Best
Undiscovered DJ" in DJ Mag's 2003 Top 100 issue.

Bill Patrick's love and dedication for the music have been the driving
forces behind his rapid success. We share his love, and hope you will
too!

Subject: {pb-cle} MODA : One of my proudest moments.

After a long night of checking out some great events
(Burn The Phoenix and Nitty Gritty) we decided to
reduce ourselves to the level of attending the nights
happenings at super mega corporate drug dealing rave
club moda, if only to promote our musically superior
events to the naive yet innocently programmed crowd at
moda.  After managing to get ourselves in for nothing
seeing that it was about closing time, and getting
pockets full of flyers into the realms of the greedy
corporate nazi club moda, for our superior events,
Displacement and the Techno Bi-Weekly Frequency
Response, I had the proud honor of being forcefully
escorted out of the club by one of the clubs many
minions doing what they were paid to do....prevent the
rebirth of a truly underground DIY scene.  When the
lights went off in moda that’s when I felt was the
perfect time to let our flyers rain from the ceilings
with a hard flick of the wrist into the air with a
handful of flyers.  Quickly after this I was honored
by a continuous forceful shove on the back towards the
side door where I was told "that wasn’t cool" with my
only response being "thank you" accompanied by a large
smile.  This would upset many people but for me this
was one of my greatest honors and proudest moments.  I
thank you moda management and staff.  
  By now many of you are probably thinking..."what is
this guys problem....moda is cool."  Well sorry to
break it to you kids....no it isn’t.  Moda goes
against everything true underground electronic music
is about.  It is the epitome of everything this is
wrong with our so-called "scene".  Do you think the
owners, management, or staff gives a fuck about the
music, the fans, or the promoters.  No they only care
about what the attendees have in their wallets, or how
many people with money to spend the promoters can
bring into their ASStablishment.  
   So in overview all these fucking corporate
Cleveland super mega nazi clubs can suck their own
disks (yes I said disks) because no matter what they
do, or no matter how much money they make, they cant
touch the heart, soul, talent, and passion, us true to
the underground have for the music, and the respect we
have for those who support us.  The only thing they
are good for at this point is a venue at which to
attempt to convert some misguided fans of electronic
music back towards to true DIY underground spirit.
  Still think I am crazy and full of shit?  Then maybe
you should question your position in this "scene"....
and you probably shouldn’t be on this list to begin
with.

DEATH TO THE SUPER MEGA CORPORATE NAZI DRUG DEALING
CLUBS.
THE REAL UNDERGROUND WILL LIVE ON FOREVER.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} MODA : One of my proudest moments.

Bottom line - MODA IS A CLUB. A nice club. One that is in business to 
make money, and that a lot of money went into making. That's why people 
make clubs - to make money. They don't say "I think I will go into debt 
today and build a club that I hope to see fail miserably and watch all 
my hard earned money go down the drain."

I've heard so many stories about the shitty security people and all the 
other shit. Well - to be quite honest, I would be pissed if someone hit 
me in the head with flyers. And if I was the guy that had to try to 
scrape them all up off the floor, that would piss me off that you just 
made it so I have to stay at the club an extra hour that night.

Would you rather have it so you have no clubs to hear your "underground 
music" at? Because that's almost where it is in Pittsburgh. I mean, 
don't get me wrong - we have nice small local nights, but you actually 
have a large club willing to foot the bill to bring in bigger talent, 
and varying talent from what I have seen. And - it's a nice enough club 
that those who are not "underground" are willing to come out and give 
this music a chance.

Honestly - I think from what I hear - a lot of people don't appreciate 
what they have there... I think that security should be friendly - and 
I think that if you handle yourself in a professional manner - and talk 
to someone higher up - that maybe it would be taken care of.

However - take responsibility for your own actions. You threw flyers 
all over there club. That isn't cool. Seriously - if I saw someone do 
that at one of my parties - I would throw them out too - and that has 
nothing to do with being corporate, or "not about the scene". It has to 
do with human decency. If you were planning to stay and help clean up 
the mess you made, then go for it - but otherwise - it sounds like you 
are ranting about something you totally brought on yourself.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} MODA : One of my proudest moments.

No no no no.  They werent concerned with people
getting hit in the head or cleaning up...they didnt
want any flyers in there at all.  Competition you
know.  I made it clear that I am not mad at the
security.  I was happy to be escorted out.  It just
gave me an even better reason to get the hell out of
that place.  I havent liked that place since it opened
and I dont like it now.  I stand for what I beleive
in, and I am proud to have been kicked out of that
hideous club.  I was there for one reason and one
reason only...to push my positive influence on those
in attendance.  Yes I did bring it upon myself.  I am
not ranting in anger...I am boastfully ranting.  Think
that is stupid...oh well.  

And trout...you know my comments dont apply to all
that were in attendance last night.  It was only a
generalization in order to express my mission.  

---[Would you rather have it so you have no clubs to
hear your "underground music" at?]---

Yes...I have never heard the music ("my underground
music") I would want to hear at any club in Cleveland
except for maybe Touch on occasion.  Through our
passion we would always find a way to survive.  I
manage to pull in international headliners without the
support of clubs and usually lose money (not
complaining).  And no I am not some stupid rich boy
that can afford to do this.  I work M-F 9-5 to support
the music I love.  To make cool shit happen around
here.  My bills pile up, I eat ramen noodles, and I
love music.  If I didnt do it...who else would?

What ever happend to the pride people used to get by
finding an obscure venue, pulling thier resources,
setting up thier own sound and equipment and doing
everything themselves.  DIY pride!!!

Tom Cox...you rock! Holding it down.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} laga/attic closed?

The owners of the building wanted to sell it.

Ron didn't have the money to buy it outright, and the banks won't loan
a club much money these days.

He got The Attic, Laga, and the laga balcony rezoned into apartments. 
He's waiting on the building permits, last I heard, but the clubs are
indeed closed.  The Upstage is still open, running 80's night,
Ceremony (goth/industrial), and a few others.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} MODA : One of my proudest moments.

I received my first flyer to something *better* at metropolis (the first
time around) when I was just 18.  I'm sure I would of still found it but
that helped.  Keep dropping flyers at those places cuz you might turn on
some kids to something they know nothing of.

AND YES, FUCK THESE CLUBS FOR NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO DROP FLYERS.

It is all about competition for them, they fail to see that the scene as a
whole should be a community because it IS smaller then it ever was and it
needs to be nourished and helped along.  It is very hard to have a scene
that understands the underground all the way up the line.  What a wonderful
city Cleveland could be IF the entire community was together on this.  How
many clubs have to close before they realize that they need to support the
artists and music local or otherwise that will hold the attention of the
mass market blockbuster consumer?  Don't they see that people crave
something real in their lives?  Something of substance that can touch them
deeper then the new Spiderman movie.

needs to knock some sense into the schmucks running pitt.  what kind of

You dont get it.  I am not mad about this.  And it has
nothing to do with the people that promote or work for
the club...its the club.  "Club culture" has killed
music culture.  I am not offended or angry about being
kicked out.  A headlock may have even made it a little
better.  But whatever.

Yes, because raves and undreground EDM has been around so much longer than

You all talk about the scene's death and how it is all over and in the same
statement you defend one of the reasons it is so by saying "so what if the
clubs dictate what is played" "everybody has to make money off their
investment"

Don't you care that people can't make a choice about going to another
event/hearing something else because they don't know about it?  Not everyone
is eager enough or has the mindset to hunt down and find the music they want
to hear.  I would say people on this list are of that mindset and do hunt
down what they want but others don't or can't for some reason.

weeeeeeeeeeeeee. Back to the xpander ;p

I agree, Paul. blah blah blah.

yeah, it might be cool if you were exposing the owner of the club as some 
{insert whatever criminal you prefer here} to really open people's eyes as 
to who their supporting.  Moda isn't doing anything for the "scene"  sorry, 
i thought the scene died back in 1995, maybe it was 94 depending who you 
ask.  As of now, both headlining and local djs / artists are being brought 
in and you're bitching because you can't flyer there.  And you're crying 
foul about "keeping it underground" because you don't like the so called 
corporate attitude.

cross promotion is a double edged sword.  this is also known as conflict of 
interest in the business world - which goes hand in hand - if you worked for 
gateway computers, would you want people from dell to come into your store 
to say "dude, you're getting a dell?"  as far as i know, Moda has never 
allowed anyone else to flyer inside their club so this should not be news to 
you (someone correct me if wrong). i've seen flyers thrown out by the 
managers, bartenders and security, and i'm sure it will continue.  Had this 
happened within the opening weeks (almost 2 years ago) you might have had 
some semblence of an argument because all they did (in the beginning)  was 
talk about was supporting the local scent, but it was a good 8 monthsbefore 
a local from cleveland was even booked there.  Anyways, the fact you had to 
"sneak" flyers in and then proceed to shower Moda's patrons with them in an 
act of "defiance" and complain about it - well, i shouldn't have to finish 
this sentence...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} laga/attic closed?

no matter who the mayor was (or council), they would't be able to control 
Pitt.  Pitt has too much money and brings too much into the city.  Over the 
last 7 or 8 years, Pitt has been buying up all the real estate they can get 
their hands on in Oakland... both them and UPMC.  They own most of Boquet 
and Oakland avenue (probably Atwood and Meyran too).  Along Forbes and Fifth 
they own from Craig St / Dithridge down to Craft and if they don't own it, 
they have a great influence of their owners and probably will own it within 
the next 10 years (sorry, "got any change; change; change" man and other 
panhandlers in my eyes you're a nuisance).  As a former resident of Oakland, 
i would love to see the area cleaned up, and it's well on its way, however 
the sacrifice seems that it's pushing out some of the local interests that 
defined Oakland as some sort of cultural area.

Many fine points adam, most that I temporarily skipped over cuz im on the
run with finals....weeee....

But my question to you and all the other "original heads" is this:

If ?the scene? is dead and has been, what exactly am I (and everyone else
here for that matter) wasting my(/our) time with now? ...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} MODA : One of my proudest moments.

This thread reeks of something we have seen in abundance the last year in 
Cleveland:

Rag on anything and everything you are not involved in, until you are 
actually involved with it.

I have a friend who has a log of internet posts from people who have done 
just that, maybe I'll get him to share it.

This is the music business.  The key word being BUSINESS.   You don't send 
Ronald McDonald into Burger King to advertise.  Get your own fucking 
customers, and BUILD a scene -- don't try to take it everyone else.  When 
everyone is working from the same customer base (the few thosand people who 
do go out), and the #1 marketing tactict for some in Cleveland is to breed 
contempt for the competitor -- no wonder people stop paying attention to ALL 
of it.   You get what you give.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} MODA : One of my proudest moments.

Clubs don't control anything - the promoter running the night at the club is the one controlling it. And if a promoter decides 
to be legit, and book a night at a club, rather than try to do it somewhere else - where there is way more risk invloved, then 
that's their decision.

If you don't like the club's policy, then don't go there. If you don't like the talent that the promoter is booking, then stay away. 
But this has nothing to do with the argument you are making.

They don't want competition - that's completely logical. If someone decided to throw an event the same night as yours, and 
followed you around and gave flyers out to everyone that you did, drawing from the same group of people, would you be 
happy about that? I don't think you would. As I said before, clubs exist to make money. But if a promoter who loves this 
music - maybe just as much as you do - can get a club like that to let them book who they want to book - how is that any 
different from what you are doing?

Just because you don't want to abide by their policies, doesn't mean that they are evil corporate monsters trying to sponge 
off of "your" scene. Nobody is saying they dislike you - what most people are saying is that you are making an argument 
that doesn't make sense. So - you hate Moda. Maybe you hate the djs those PROMOTERS bring in. Obviously other people 
like them, and they have every right to. Just because it's not the most "underground" music, doesn't mean people can't like 
it, and it doesn't make those promoters wrong for choosing to book music they like, in a venue they like.

Death...Nazi...???? C'mon dude. Why are you in
a club trying to build your underground scence???
You know better than that. A club is a CLUB. Let
people choose man. Build your underground scene
by your positive influence, not by hate. The
first person you should always promote to is
yourself. Promote music and art. Not hate.


You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright Alright

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We're doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright Alright

You say you'll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know know it's gonna be alright
Alright Alright

So you're telling me McDonalds doesn't try to take customers from Burger King with things like
advertising?

You're telling me business is all about building "grass roots"??? HA!

Trust me, pal...BUSINESS is ALL ABOUT TAKING THE OTHER GUY'S CUSTOMERS.

Music is about...music. Music is not business.

I will admit I did overexaggerate a bit and use some
extreme words but those words were only meant in a
playfull manner in order to create some debate
concerning something I personally see as an issue in
our community.  I will clarify once again that I
respect anyone and everyone that is working hard to
support what they love no matter what type of venue
they choose to hold thier events at.  Much respect to
everyone that is involved with and supports the
community as a whole.

Apologies to Tom, Goose and Colin for having to dip out early...despite the music being top-notch
(tom, what were the two Trax records you played back to back?), I was fading fast and deperately in
need of sleep.

Still very glad I came out. The place is great...very warm and mellow atmosphere...Will be back
regularly.

Everything is buisness. You just aren't looking at it correctly. Buisness does 
not mean lacking art it means people are getting paid or a chance to express 
said art.

LOL
last time I checked i went out to hang out with friends, dance, listen to
 good music. If clean, ventilatied, and lacking in "rave grime" is a bad
 thing brought about by the "mega-millian corp." then kick ass.

why does everything have to be political. Are the moda owners clubbing baby
seals and noone told me. Lighten the fuck up. If it was my club and i was
bringing in decent talent and local talent and someone wanted to flyer i
would be hell of against it to. Have you seen the rate at which a club
blossoms and then goes under in cleveland. Its about 8 months.

Feel free to throw flyers to promote the "underground" and bring new heads
that will go from the club to a dirty rave event ( i have no idea what your
promoting so I am going over the top here take no offense) so that they can
be scared away.

Its just people dancing. The scene your talking about is gone and is not
coming back and I think in many ways this is a good thing.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} MODA : One of my proudest moments.

Here's what I don't get:

Why do these internationally respected artists play smaller events under
assumed names?  Are they the same ones that would play MODA under their own
name?  If so, then why do you care?

And yes, I like to go out, drink sometimes, AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.  Sorry if
I don't like to be educated when I go out all the fucking time.  If there's
a certain kind of music I crave hearing, I bet I know someone else who
listens to it, and can find a way to hear it.

Oh, and fuck no I don't wear a designer suit.  Can't afford one.  I spend
too much money on music.  Wouldn't wear one if I could.

If the music is better, people will come.  MODA isn't Clear Channel.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} MODA : One of my proudest moments.

would you go to mcdonald's to promote morton's  ?

would you go to the dollar store to promote a sale at sax  ?

nothing good is going to come from scouting the clubs for people to come
to your events.  it might sound funny, but you're better off talking to
random people at bus stops.  get 10 social people with good taste in music
together and just hit the streets.  that's the best promotion around.

go to borders or barnes and noble and put your flyers in good magazines.
go to independently owned shops - record stores, skate shops, book stores,
cafes.
http://craigslist.org - post on new message boards to new people looking for
new stuff to do.
in the fall when college is back in session, hand out tapes and cds to
students new to the city.
there are a million things you can do before resorting to big clubbin fools.

it's always been a last resort working with club owners.  i thought i
found a good situation last time with sauce.  of course i was wrong -
who needs good music when you have good cocaine.  and then i think
back 12 years to the metropol "raves" when it was ok for certain bouncers
to sell their e, but not cool for anyone else to.  you definitely have to
give
up part of yourself to keep a club night going.  but there's always a better
chance of finding like minded individuals in out of the way places not
looking
for big bucks.

youre exactly right. anyone who runs their music shit like a 
business that thinks that they exclusively exist to bring in money 
without doing anything worthwhile (major record labels, megaclubs, 
etc) deserves to be shit upon. its funny because without the 
fucking framework that 20 years of other clubs in cleveland 
provided, fucking bitchass moda wouldnt even exist. now they dont 
allow flyers? fuck em. if i lived in cleveland, everytime i saw a 
stack of flyers for moda sitting in a record shop, or DEFINITELY 
in another club, id throw those fuckers in the garbage can.

new people dont appear at events from nowhere, they have to get a 
flyer first. the same way i have no problem flyering at any other 
venue (including malls, which ive heard you people bitch about) i 
think there should be flyers at even the corniest mainstream 
events. you cant change anyone's mind if they never see what you 
have to offer.

no offense to you moose, but at this point it seems like jeremy 
has a stranglehold on ill shit coming into cleveland. i havent 
seen much about the nitty gritty guys stuff, and since april and 
kate quit doing their night at touch the dope underground shit has 
come from jeremy a large percentage of the time. plus dood runs a 
record label with releases by internationally known motherfuckers 
that he's the only person to bring to cleveland. i can appreciate 
feeling annoyed that he made a blanket statement like that, but 
seriously , dood runs tings.

>Clubs don't control anything - the promoter running the night at 
the club is the one controlling it. 

thats funny, i can think of a conversation i had very recently 
with an established local promoter who told me about a club owner 
who said they wanted "trance and progressive" played at their 
club, not house music. i mean this was literally just days ago. 

>They don't want competition - that's completely logical. If 
someone decided to throw an event the same night as yours, and 
>followed you around and gave flyers out to everyone that you did, 
drawing from the same group of people, would you be 
>happy about that?

see, this is the thing i hate most about your argument. its the 
same shit you stuck up for when your boys did that friday night 
shit at laga. running a weekly doesnt entitle you to be 
in "competition" with everything else. essentially it did end up 
that way in pittsburgh where friday nights had nothing major going 
on outside of lacklustre talent provided at laga. a small indie 
electro show isnt going to take all of the superclub's customers 
away. the notion that it would is ridiculous. this shit is not a 
competition. the only competition is to see who can book good 
music, and that shit is over already. big clubs lose. 


>I don't think you would. As I said before, clubs exist to make 
money. But if a promoter who loves this 
>music - maybe just as much as you do - can get a club like that 
to let them book who they want to book - how is that any 
>different from what you are doing?

so what club is going to have a night with electro, techno, and 
breakcore? not gonna happen. and in the meantime they feel like 
they can monopolize the dance crowd by manipulating what people 
get flyers for. good job. 

>Just because you don't want to abide by their policies, doesn't 
mean that they are evil corporate monsters trying to sponge 
>off of "your" scene. Nobody is saying they dislike you - what 
most people are saying is that you are making an argument 
>that doesn't make sense. 

well obviously they have SOME feeling towards people doing things 
not at their club, be it dislike or whatever. pussies.

your ideas are all good ones, but you should flyer EVERYWHERE. 
especially big clubs with bad music. thats where you find people 
who just might not be that deep into things and thats all theyve 
heard of at that point. theyre ready to take the next step, they 
just havent found out about it because the club is insulated.

at the expomart magick richard pointed out a couple that we met at
the jiffy lube a few days earlier + our minister neighbor and his brother.
they never got a flyer.  i can think of 200 people who started going to
parties because rich randomly talked to them and invited them.  flyers made
promoters lazy.  they're supposed to be auxilary.  things were "good back
in the day" because promoters were selective about who they invited.  i
think
joel printed maybe 100 of his hand drawn flyers for high voltage.

no greasy hamburgers at high voltage : )

this was, of course, before raves had entered the mainstream 
consciousness. you could hoodwink and fool people. now you have 
many stereotypes to work against, its alot harder work. like i 
said, getting random people to come out is fine. we flyered for 
our things back in the day at punk shows and ska shows and 
whatever else was going on. those places need to be hit.

<<Everything is buisness.>>

NO.
WRONG.
STOP RIGHT THERE.

NOT everything is about business.

I'm not saying what Jeremy did was right or wrong. I haven't even made that judgement for myself
yet.

BUT...what he DID, he did for reaasons of personal conviction, knowing full-well that it would
probably get him thrown out.

Look at it this way -

If you were a business owner, and you BELIEVED you had the best product, wouldn't you want your
customers to be the MOST KNOWLEDGABLE customers around? Then, the most educated people believe you
have the best product, and they share that knowledge with other people.

The only business that benefits by keeping it's customers from information is one that has something
to hide.

and i'll add that i've seen way more bumping good time dj sets
with 100 or less people in attendance.  get out of the 'big is better'
line of thinking.  you don't need to get 500 idiots there to make it
good.  and you don't have to pay djs a million bucks.  if they don't
want to play for reasonable money, find someone else who will.
times are a changin.  they should know this.

you shouldn't want your flyers in the pocket of every person who leaves a

Just because he decieded to go into someone elses place of buisness and 
advertise for what the owners concieved as their competition then ya he did 
do something wrong. Moda is not busting into his events flyering even if he 
allowed it. You guys talk about respect but that is blatent disregard for 
respect. just because they don't agree with you on the "Purity of the scene 
and the ideologies of what is right and wrong with cleveland" doesn't give 
you (the global you) a right to to disrespect their wishes in their 
buisnesses.

Yeah i would want that and I would work to achieve that but i wouldn't be lazy

You have a good point, but the root of this all dawned on me:

Ravers are used to going to a different spot every weekend for a different 
event.   Handing out flyers to spread information on where the party is next 
week is an important way to spread information.    Clubs are in the business 
of having repeat customers, week after week and that _is_ what keeps their 
doors open.

One of Moda's arguements (and I'm sure not the only one)  for not allowing 
flyers is that it makes the club looks cluttered.  Indeed, when a (if you 
want to call him that) promoter throws a stack of 50 flyers all over the 
bartop.... it is cluttered.   Then you have what Jeremy did... more clutter. 
If you have ever been in Moda, one of the first things you notice about it 
is that it is VERY "clean" looking with white walls and such.   Hand to hand 
flyering is one thing, but just putting flyers all over the place sometimes 
defeats the purpose.  Mythodic has even said that Moda isn't too happy about 
having flyers around for their own upcomming Ritual events inside the club.

I guess what I am trying to say, is that I can clearly see both sides to 
this issue of competing flyers.   Respect the policies that are in place and 
realize that arguing about this on a mailing list is COMPLETELY stupid, 
petty, and a waste of time.    Take a step back and look at both sides and 
you will really see this is POINTLESS.  ENd of discussion.

Perhaps that is true of that particular club. And if a promoter chooses 
to do a night in a club that only wants that kind of music, then the 
promoter is still booking the music - just within a genre that was 
established by the club - that is their choice to do a night there, or 
to keep looking for another place to do it. I have seen almost all 
genres advertised on this list at Moda - perhaps they haven't booked 
something as "undergound" as you would like, but maybe that promoter 
just doesn't like the same music as you do.

You made absolutely no sense with this one. It has nothing to do with 
what I said. If I was doing a weekly club night, I wouldn't want people 
coming to that night to promote for an event that clearly is within the 
same scene. Not saying they shouldn't try to do something else if 
that's what they want - then go for it - just don't promote it at the 
club. Like Kelly said - go find your own people to promote to, why 
would you want to try to get those people at the club who you just 
criticized to come to your event anyway?

Addressing what you said - the only reason Fridays were "lacklustre" as 
you say, is because that's obviously what people wanted to hear. Just 
because Tim and Ted did their own thing, didn't mean no one else in the 
city could go out and start their own night. They weren't the mafia 
coming to your door to shoot you down if you did something else. In 
fact, when they decided to leave Laga, they were out supporting Sauce a 
lot of Fridays, so it wasn't like they dictated what happened in the 
city.

If big clubs lose, then how come they are packed every week and your 
"indie" shows are struggling to get by? Seriously - I wonder if someday 
you are going to come to reality. When we used to throw parties - we 
booked people who would bring a crowd, but also brought people who were 
virtually unknown to expose their music. And you still need to get over 
the fact that just because you don't like something, doesn't mean that 
everyone agrees with you.

Yep - you got me there. Those clubs are monopolizing the crowds. They 
are running down the street throwing your flyers in the garbage. They 
are going to "underground" events and beating people up who are 
flyering for something that isn't theirs.

Think about how stupid what you said sounds. It is THEIR club. If they 
want a policy to say you can't flyer - whether it be because they don't 
want competition, or they don't want to pick a bunch of grungy flyers 
up off the floor at the end of the night, or whatever their reason is, 
it's their club. If you are that desperate to promote to the crowd they 
have drawn in - then stand outside at the end of the night and give 
people flyers as they leave.

Once again - it's THEIR club, THEIR policy. You don't like it, don't go 
there. Like I said before - there have been times when I stayed after 
our parties scraping flyers off the floor of a venue until noon, I 
don't personally feel like that is fair to me. After that, I had no 
problem with people putting their flyers on a table or whatever, but 
throwing them out into the crowd? Give me a break. I wouldn't want that 
person there either.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} MODA : One of my proudest moments.

I see a lot of strong points on both sides... not to be too much of a
diplomat.

The bifurcation here is strong. We all enjoy one-offs, but the risk of
putting them together is so great these days that it usually needs to be
offset by something like liquor sales in an established venue with permits
and the like. With that you inevitably stifle creative and original ideas
and music... so what to do?

I can't comment on Moda specifically because I've never been there. I've
heard lots of negative things about it though, more than any other club I
can recall. I remember when people said Groove was going to ruin the scene;
I'm still not sure whether it did or not. I know that promoters losing tens
of thousands of dollars didn't help. Perhaps the two were related, who
knows?

I will concede that fliers are very annoying when used improperly. They
should only be stacked neatly or delivered hand-to-hand to people who WANT
THEM, and I also think anything over a quarter sheet size is too big unless
it needs to be bigger for some artistic or informative purpose. You should
respect a club that doesn't want fliers inside without making accusations of
conspiracy to hurt supposed competition. If you actually had something going
on which could be CONSIDERED competition then it wouldn't be a problem
anyway, now would it?

The last thing... and this is going to get me flamed... but the last thing
I've got to say is that this music is not necessarily married to the culture
up around which it sprung. The two can be discreet entities and a club which
is a privately owned business is allowed to pick and choose which of those
elements it allows on its premises.

I'd personally prefer to attend original and creative one-off events in
different well-managed spaces which give one that ephemeral fleeting
feeling, and enjoying innovative and edgy music at these events in the
company of respectable, responsible individuals. Unfortunately, it seems the
opportunity for that has passed, so people are forced to settle for
something like a club, which is regrettably the next best thing. Unless of
course you're looking to get arrested, which for me only happens in the late
summer/ early fall. ;-)

Bedtime...

The list has been so quiet because the sig is getting old.
Traat?

Happy rolling face-eating PLUR-bunnies find 'filter my cunt' offensive.

Subject: {pb-cle} This Sunday at Twist (BSP)

For those in the cleveland area who feel like hanging
out this Sunday, listening to good choons, and perhaps
drinking a bloody mary or 3 the following will be on
the decks:

Jamie Tyler and Damon Havill (assorted techy stuff)
4:30-9:30
Mark Strauss and Cloud Ten (9:30-close) (assorted
varieties of house)

It's free, the bloody mary's are good, and the garage
doors will  be open if its nice, so if anyone is
looking for somewhere to chill and unwind from the
weekend this is a great spot.

Hope to see at at least a few folks out,
-Jamie

Kinda reminds me of this shop at the corner of Grandview ave. and 
Dublin rd. here in Columbus. It's some sort of high performance car 
shop, but it's called "The Speed Factory" and there's a big sign out 
front with an arrow that points to the door that says "We Make Speed 
Here!"

For you to get  feel of what's going on in the worldwide underground
electro scene right now I would like to invite everyone to

Experimedia Communication's & Molotov Record's
 
DISPLACEMENT : Cleveland's Pre-Movement fest event.
   
  Headlining are several of Holland's most recognized electro artists who are also headlining the Dutch Stage at this year's main Movement festival in Detroit while they are visiting here overseas, Alden Tyrell, Novamen, and DJ Overdose.  Also included on the lineup are some of Detroit's electro legends from the heydays of Detroit's techno/electro movement (Aux Men, Ultradyne) as well as other artists from Detroit who are planning to play one of the "official nodes" for this years movement festival, Mesu Kasumai & Project 65.  Several of the electro acts will be playing live armed with loads of classic vintage hardware that they know how to rock as well as any good dj.  I am sure you will notice from the lineup that alongside electro I have also chosen to represent techno, with the inclusion of some of the area's most expertise techno & electro DJs such as Andy James, Product 19 (who will be playing vs each other a special tag team set on 4 turntables), Dj Boompsie, Paco de Bongo,
 Colin Pierce (who will be playing a special electro set) Dan Mcleod, and Alexander Holt.  Dj Speculator from NYC is also joining the lineup and I even decided to throw in a live Trip-Hop band Aeris.
   
  I chose to hold this event at Pat's In The Flats Bar because I appreciate its true underground feel and roots.  The atmosphere there is great especially when they have the patio open which will host one of two stages at this event.  Its down in the flats, but in the area of the flats no one knows about.  The industrial area of the flats.  So the backdrop consists of tall oil refineries and other industrial scenery with the city looking over from above.  So it really feels like you are out in the middle of industrial nowhere with the city lingering over in the distance.  Its quite cool.  I must also mention that is one of Cleveland's oldest bars and is a part of Cleveland underground music history hosting shows back into the days of the early punk rock and industrial scenes in the 70's and 80's.  There will also be live original 3D animated visuals by Tryobot of kikoristudios.com.  I am confident it will be a good time with good music for anyone that comes.  Pat's serves cheap food
 and good beer too BTW.
  
  Below you will find a categorized list of links featuring artist discographies, artist sites, label sites, and downloadable tracks and mixes by artists performing at this event.  Please take some time to discover information on most of the artists on this amazing lineup that we at Experimedia and Molotov Records are proud present to Cleveland.  Below the links you can find full info on this event.  Hope to see you there and thanks for reading this thus far.

Bush had to say something I think. Plausible deniability becomes much more
difficult when there are explicit pictures of heinous acts floating around
the Internet.

I am not going to address the whole "fuck 'em, this is war" camp. I simply
think its worth mentioning that as the indelible mark, which is 9-11 fades
from the immediate forefront of most mouth-breathing American's minds,
especially the part about it being the SAUDIS that instigated the attacks,
a new-new Pearl Harbor is going to be necessary to incite America into
authentic, vehement, bloodlust. What better way than to incite a couple of
sleeper cells into action by way of these horrible atrocities?

I guess thats more of a rhetorical question than anything else. I'll drop
it though, this is still not a list about politics - even though many of
us have very strong political views.

I will concede your point. It is most assuredly not some result of a
direct action of bush. To make such a claim would be tin-foil-hat-speak.






PAUL:
I think a LOT of people had to turn their heads to allow this to happen
though. 19 year old PFCs may not understand the Geneva Convention (they
should) but their superior officers damn well better. There is a fine line
between effective interrogation tactics and abuse. Making a prisoner jack
off in another's mouth, is WAY past that line.

Guess this isn't really going anywhere, I just find it very unusual that
this could come to pass. Also, I think this is going to cause some
enormous repercussions for the U.S.

I'll Hitler myself on this. Sorry for the blabbity blab.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: holy. shitballs.

what ever happened to "the buck stops here"? with bush it seems 
that he passes the buck to whomever its most convenient to give it 
to: it was clinton's fault that the terrorists attacked us, it was 
tenet's fault he put bad info in the state of the union, etc. now 
people are talking about rumsfeld taking the fall for this. 
whatever. its a big joke. bush will take no responsibility for 
what goes on in his administration. if nothing else he should be 
taking responsibility for choosing idiots to be so highly ranked, 
but he wouldnt even do that. twat.

This ain't your daddy's guitar. Imagine one amplifier for each string. Or
each string sampled individually. Wonder how much they cost.

On the gear tip, does anyone actually own a copy of LSDJ or Nanoloop? I 
need a cheap gear fix, and I've been curious about these for a while.

By the way, I think that guitar runs about $3000, and it has some sort 
of weird ethernet interface.

you'd be better off buying a studio les paul...and putting a roland midi
pickup on it.

it would probably be a grand cheaper too.

"At any rate I'll never go there again!" said Alice, as she picked her way through the wood. "It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!" 

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. "That's very curious!" she thought. "But everything's curious to-day. I think I may as well go in at once." And in she went. 

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. "Now, I'll manage better this time," she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. 

Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and thenâ€”she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.

Subject: {pb-cle} Tomfoolery

I heard a rumor that Tomfoolery was starting back up out in akron.  I heard 
it might start back up this saturday but I'm not sure yet.  If they have it 
at the same wharehouse it used to be it would be sweet.  I was in there a 
few months ago and the place looked incredible.  I'll post when I hear more.

Matt

Subject: {pb-cle} an interview with Noel Sanger

THE HEADRUSH MUSIC SUMMER SERIES, PART 1

Friday, May 21, 9pm-4am

NOEL SANGER (noelsanger.com, Gravity Music Group, Nettwerk)

HEADRUSH MUSIC EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH NOEL SANGER:

Many of your interviews from 2002 (when Summerbreeze II was released) referred to your take on progressive as saying that it's "...not necessarily a genre, but an attitude...It's an intangible thing...Taking chances, moving forward, being subtle rather than obvious. This is progressive." How have you continued to progress and moved forward musically, and what styles can your listeners expect from you in 2004?

NS: The reality is that statement was a contextual response to the previous two years where progressive came to be synonymous with this deep, tribally, plodding sound. A thousand identical records a week were coming out. Having been really focused in on a sound called progressive, and all its various permutations, since about 1993, I just couldn't get my head around THIS as the exclusive genre definition of progressive. I think that the tide has turned and now most DJ's are playing a more diverse sound: breaks, melodies, etc. So to actually answer your question, that is the direction I was moving in 2 or 3 years ago and have continued on that way. Basically everything I've always been into, but I am more integrated stylistically than I ever have been before. I donâ€™t play big 140 bpm trance tunes, but you'll hear plenty of the best elements of trance. You'll also hear techy bits, and housey bits, and you'll hear breaks. I have always liked breaks since my first breaks releas
es nearly ten years ago and today there are more exciting things happening in the (progressive) breaks scene than anywhere else. 


What is your relationship with Gravity Music Group?

NS: Gravity is the company founded late last year by former Nettwerk America Dance honcho William Godoy. One of the main functions of Gravity is artist management, and the roster now includes myself, Angel Alanis, and Compufonic/Digital Assassins. Its really exciting to be a part of something like this, from the ground up, and to work with someone as talented and dedicated as William. After 4 years with a massive company (focused on massive artists) like Nettwerk Management, I am loving the whole experience of being with a smaller company.


What kinds of projects are you working on these days?

NS: Busy over my head! I have 8-10 releases set for the next 5 months, including my first single for Electrofly in the UK, a remix of Prince QuickMix that's slated for the new Luke Chable comp, and a couple of vocal tunes for Release Records in Toronto. Finalizing the deal for my next mix CD, which we are fighting the clock to get released in October, pulling together the pieces for an artist album, and working with a live band. For the last year I have been teaching at FullSail here in Orlando, and one of the perks has been nearly unfettered use of the multimillion dollar studio complex to record. So I have my for-fun heavy rock semi-punk political project on which I sing and play guitar, and then a long awaited "serious" project with my wife and collaborator, Dauby. Her project is awesome, just great songs with a lot of guitar and a lot of electronics. And a full band. Dauby's also writing an AMAZING batch of songs for an album project with Medway of Hooj fame. I have no id
ea where all of this is going but I am more excited about the music than I have been in years. We'll have updates and snips at http://www.noelsanger.com as they become available if anyone is interested. 


What's really doing it for you these days musically? What's the last set/DJ/music that really made you say, "WOW!"? Where is your inspiration coming from?

NS: There's this whole new bunch of DJ's who are totally helping evolve the sound, and a whole new generation of producers, some of whom were like 10 when I put out my first record. The love and energy coming from these cats is awesome! Names... umm... Habersham, Jake Todd, GrayArea, Evan Marcus, Shiloh, Digital Witchcraft, Jon Lisle, Stroud, Sultan, Holmes Ives, Infusion and I'll stop because I could go on for a long time, and I'd still forget somebody who deserves a mention. And those aren't all new guys, and they're not all 21, but they all care about the music and the direction it takes and it shows in what they do. Angel Alanis has an awesome artist album coming out that's going to surprise a lot of people. And, I'll have to say that at WMC this year I was made to remember a couple of times that DJ Three is still one of my very favorite DJ's in the world, after all these years. Unsung hero. He just rocks.


What are the recent international gigs you've played, and how were the crowds? What kinds of music did the people in those cities react to most strongly? How is such a reaction different from your US gigs?

NS: It seems like it's stronger a lot of other places than most places in the United States now. But I think it's coming back around here, too. Last fall I played in Japan and some stuff in South America. On the Tokyo gig, the country got hit by a typhoon. People actually died just 2 hours south of us! And still that night, over 1500 people turned out. Another notable night was playing to over 1000 people at a house party in Lima. It was full on, Cusqueno beer and Red Bull sponsored it, but it was in a very large house. Musically it's always different and any DJ has to have two-way communication with the crowd. But overall the response has been very good everywhere, and my biggest tunes tend to go down well anywhere.


What should we promoters and record labels be doing to turn on more people and wider audiences to the progressive sounds?

NS: Variety, Diversity, Less rules. No more sets that require a headful of something to "get." I think the musical snobbery of the "prog" scene, eschewing certain sounds as "Cheese" has really hurt our standing in the dance world. Not that there isnâ€™t cheese, but at the end of the night it's about dancing and having fun. I like to play music that maybe has some deeper, or spiritual connotations to it, but ultimately, spirituality is just the bouquet, the flowering of ordinary life and nothing celebrates life more completely than un-self-consciously dancing and losing your cares in the music. Its all about celebration and fun and less about chin stroking and trainspotting! 


You are an accomplished producer, and also a crowd-moving DJ. If you had to choose between one or the other which would you rather be known as a great DJ or a great producer? Why?

NS: I don't know if I have an answer for that one, because I don't really care. I'm not even sure I really want to known as a "great" anything. Recognition is great, but... I'm just blessed every time one person enjoys what I do, either in the studio or behind the decks. I just try to do what I do, and the outcome is what it is. More important is the question, Am I being fully present in every moment of my life?" "What am I contributing to the world?" "What's my motivation when I write a piece of music?" I'm certainly not trying to be a saint or anything and damn, I know this sounds trite and cheesy: But I just feel SO fortunate to be able to write music that people actually enjoy and care about. I'm a dad of 2 boys and our little girl is on the way in September, even more, I've seen little kids begging in the streets in third-world countries while I rode in a luxury car to my gig to play for the elite rich kids, and I cried inside and the tears never left. So how fortunate a
m I to support my little ones doing what I love to do? I am far from wealthy and I work very hard to make ends meet, but when I think of this I feel like the richest man alive.


Have you ever been to Ohio? If so, when?

NS: Back in the rave days I played a few parties in Cleveland and Lorain. 98, 99, 2000, I think. "Crystallize II," and both "Music Is The Key" parties for L.I.M.E. These were live P.A.'s with my friend and then-vocalist, Nicole Henry. I'm not sure, but I don't think I have EVER DJ'ed in Ohio!


If you could say one thing to the folks in Cleveland before you get here, what would it be?

NS: Thanks in advance for inviting me to your fine city! It has been a while, and I am looking forward to coming back! See you on the dancefloor!

<<Bush had to say something I think.>>

Really?

I find it endlessly fascinating that he deems it necessary to apologize to the people of Iraq, and
yet has still continuously neglected to apologize to the families of the 9/11 victims.

It seems to me that he is equally removed-and-hard-to-be-implicated from the actual event happenings
in both scenarios...and yet, when faced with two scenarios:

-apologize to the people that could potentially vote you out of office in 6 months

OR

-apologize to the people who are still sitting on billions in future oil proceeds

...who did he pick to apologize to.

Anyone that votes for Bush after four years of this irresponsible, incomprehensible bullshit is LESS
than a brainless idiot.

<<Plausible deniability becomes much more difficult when there are explicit pictures of heinous acts
floating around the Internet.>>

Well, had they appeared on the internet first, and not on 60 Minutes, I think the case of
"photoshopping" the images could have come in to play and HELPED to discredit and devalue the
accusations. (Though I don't think it would've gone away completely.)

But whoever DID release those photos did it the right way, either by luck or by sheer media
relations savvy.

<<I am not going to address the whole "fuck 'em, this is war" camp.>>

Yeah, that argument might have some weight if it weren't a known fact that some of the "prisoners"
are simply "detainees" and haven't been charged with anything yet.

Subject: {pb-cle} "real alternative" help, please...

hey gang...can y'all test something for me?

i'm trying to listen to the Air America Radio stream from their site (www.airamericaradio.com)

When I click the "listen live" option, it opens the "Media Player Classic", but the status tells me
"cannot render the file".

Now, apparently I can't open Real One player even though it is still technically installed on my
machine.

So, either the makers of MPC have something against liberal talk radio or I'm in need of a little
assistance here....

Any help y'all can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

I liken the pain I experience when listening to Sean Hannity to having my ear drums gouged out with
a toothbrush-shiv by a burly inmate looking for love in all the wrong ways.

That said, thanks for the help.

Out of curiosity, who on the list other than Meghan was at the parties Noel mentions?

"NS: Back in the rave days I played a few parties in Cleveland and Lorain. 98, 99, 2000, I think. "Crystallize II," and both "Music Is The Key" parties for L.I.M.E. These were live P.A.'s with my friend and then-vocalist, Nicole Henry."

For anyone coming out to this....I suggest arriving
early to assure admitance. Many people from all over
the country are planning to head to Cleveland for this
event and we see a possibility of reaching capacity.

This event is 18+ but only those who are 21+ will be
allowed re-entry privledges BTW.

There will be plenty of parking available. As far as
parking along the fence please do not park beyond the
orange poll (a sign will be posted). Additional
parking is available along the side of West 3rd and
along the side of Literary St on the hill.

Mike from Lime knows Noel really well.  He was supposed to play at Funky
Buddah (with the vocalest) at one point, but not sure if it ever happend.
Part of me thinks that it did, because I remember them having a vocalist and
can't think of anyone else who it could have been.

Crytallize II was probably thrown by Crystal Clear.

Part of me thinks that it did, because I remember them having a vocalist and
can't think of anyone else who it could have been.

Crytallize II was probably thrown by Crystal Clear.

Out of curiosity, who on the list other than Meghan was at the parties Noel
mentions?

"NS: Back in the rave days I played a few parties in Cleveland and Lorain.
98, 99, 2000, I think. "Crystallize II," and both "Music Is The Key" parties
for L.I.M.E. These were live P.A.'s with my friend and then-vocalist, Nicole

Yo,
Guitar Center is having their annual DJ Spinoff this month.
We need more folks to sign up for the competition and we still need a couple
judges.
The grand prize is a $4,000 DJ rig, a new car, and a record deal with Warner
Brothers (one 12").
Let me know if you or anyone you know is interested, we've got about 20 more
slots available.
Everyone gets 3 minutes on two 12s and an 05pro.
Peace!

Get to know the artists performing at
DISPLACEMENT : Cleveland's Pre-Movement Festival : May 15th
Discographies, Downloadable tracks and mixes, Label Sites, & more.
Click more, learn more, hear more.
 
For you to get  feel of what's going on in the worldwide underground
electro scene right now I would like to invite everyone to

Experimedia Communication's & Molotov Record's
 
DISPLACEMENT : Cleveland's Pre-Movement fest event.
   
  Headlining are several of Holland's most recognized electro artists who are also headlining the Dutch Stage at this year's main Movement festival in Detroit while they are visiting here overseas, Alden Tyrell, Novamen, and DJ Overdose.  Also included on the lineup are some of Detroit's electro legends from the heydays of Detroit's techno/electro movement (Aux Men, Ultradyne) as well as other artists from Detroit who are planning to play one of the "official nodes" for this years movement festival, Mesu Kasumai & Project 65.  Several of the electro acts will be playing live armed with loads of classic vintage hardware that they know how to rock as well as any good dj.  I am sure you will notice from the lineup that alongside electro I have also chosen to represent techno, with the inclusion of some of the area's most expertise techno & electro DJs such as Andy James, Product 19 (who will be playing vs each other a special tag team set on 4 turntables), Dj Boompsie, Paco de Bongo,
 Colin Pierce (who will be playing a special electro set) Dan Mcleod, and Alexander Holt.  Dj Speculator from NYC is also joining the lineup and I even decided to throw in a live Trip-Hop band Aeris.
   
  I chose to hold this event at Pat's In The Flats Bar because I appreciate its true underground feel and roots.  The atmosphere there is great especially when they have the patio open which will host one of two stages at this event.  Its down in the flats, but in the area of the flats no one knows about.  The industrial area of the flats.  So the backdrop consists of tall oil refineries and other industrial scenery with the city looking over from above.  So it really feels like you are out in the middle of industrial nowhere with the city lingering over in the distance.  Its quite cool.  I must also mention that is one of Cleveland's oldest bars and is a part of Cleveland underground music history hosting shows back into the days of the early punk rock and industrial scenes in the 70's and 80's.  There will also be live original 3D animated visuals by Tryobot of kikoristudios.com.  I am confident it will be a good time with good music for anyone that comes.  Pat's serves cheap food
 and good beer too BTW.
  
  Below you will find a categorized list of links featuring artist discographies, artist sites, label sites, and downloadable tracks and mixes by artists performing at this event.  Please take some time to discover information on most of the artists on this amazing lineup that we at Experimedia and Molotov Records are proud present to Cleveland.  Below the links you can find full info on this event.  Hope to see you there and thanks for reading this thus far.
 
-Jeremy Bible

 
P.S. Producers, DJ's, Artists, and Promoters please feel free to bring and distribute your promotional CD's, Records, Flyers, and other material.  With people coming from all over for the event this will be an ideal opportunity to network and promote your music, label, upcoming events, design, or multimedia services.

For you to get  feel of what's going on in the worldwide underground
electro scene right now I would like to invite everyone to

Experimedia Communication's & Molotov Record's
 
DISPLACEMENT : Cleveland's Pre-Movement fest event.
   
  Headlining are several of Holland's most recognized electro artists who are also headlining the Dutch Stage at this year's main Movement festival in Detroit while they are visiting here overseas, Alden Tyrell, Novamen, and DJ Overdose.  Also included on the lineup are some of Detroit's electro legends from the heydays of Detroit's techno/electro movement (Aux Men, Ultradyne) as well as other artists from Detroit who are planning to play one of the "official nodes" for this years movement festival, Mesu Kasumai & Project 65.  Several of the electro acts will be playing live armed with loads of classic vintage hardware that they know how to rock as well as any good dj.  I am sure you will notice from the lineup that alongside electro I have also chosen to represent techno, with the inclusion of some of the area's most expertise techno & electro DJs such as Andy James, Product 19 (who will be playing vs each other a special tag team set on 4 turntables), Dj Boompsie, Paco de Bongo,
 Colin Pierce (who will be playing a special electro set) Dan Mcleod, and Alexander Holt.  Dj Speculator from NYC is also joining the lineup and I even decided to throw in a live Trip-Hop band Aeris.
   
  I chose to hold this event at Pat's In The Flats Bar because I appreciate its true underground feel and roots.  The atmosphere there is great especially when they have the patio open which will host one of two stages at this event.  Its down in the flats, but in the area of the flats no one knows about.  The industrial area of the flats.  So the backdrop consists of tall oil refineries and other industrial scenery with the city looking over from above.  So it really feels like you are out in the middle of industrial nowhere with the city lingering over in the distance.  Its quite cool.  I must also mention that is one of Cleveland's oldest bars and is a part of Cleveland underground music history hosting shows back into the days of the early punk rock and industrial scenes in the 70's and 80's.  There will also be live original 3D animated visuals by Tryobot of kikoristudios.com.  I am confident it will be a good time with good music for anyone that comes.  Pat's serves cheap food
 and good beer too BTW.
  
  Below you will find a categorized list of links featuring artist discographies, artist sites, label sites, and downloadable tracks and mixes by artists performing at this event.  Please take some time to discover information on most of the artists on this amazing lineup that we at Experimedia and Molotov Records are proud present to Cleveland.  Below the links you can find full info on this event.  Hope to see you there and thanks for reading this thus far.

now all you suckers who missed amp fiddler live last year (i know 
it was almost all of you, it was pretty empty over there....) can 
catch him again. my predictions for the highlights:

amp fiddler live
duplex live
kai alce
kenny larkin
Madlib and PBW ft Jay Dee   
Mike Huckaby   
Osunlade Live   
Recloose   
Red Nose Distrikt   
Rolando   
sean deason   

i can only hope they add at least one 3 chairs deejay in there. 
kai alce and huckaby will kill it though, for sure. 

tom

Even that fool Rumsfield knows that the smiley face tattooed on my 
cobra-hood for a back is sheer mockery.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

The Third Eye V.5 - Techno Version
Presented by Goahead Productions

Friday, May 28, 2004 - Cleveland, OH

A warm up for DEMF!!

Goahead productions continues The Third Eye ritual. Don't miss this
soulful experience as we get deep into the roots!

Trevor Lamont - Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com
aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands. He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about
the sounds of house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony
Humphies, Lil Louie Vega, and Frankie Knuckles. Eventually he got his own
tables and decided to take that step on the other side of the table.
Through years of decication and practice to his form he has made himself
into a very accomplished house D.J. Trevor has traveled all over sharing
his unique style of mixing house. His style is very mix intensive. If you
watch him you'll notice that he's constantly in the mix and that helps to
bring about nice textured and thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets
are usually very sexy and deep. He can pump it up though and has been know
to drop the occasional surprise techno sets.

RYSKI - BerettaMusic/ColorRecordings/www.ryski.com - Detroit, MI

Ryski currently resides in Detroit where he owns and operates the 
Berettamusic record label with Brian Kage. His productions have been 
described as techy, funky and sometimes off the wall which seems to mirror
his  quirky attitude. He lived overseas for 5 years (Japan for 3 years and
 Guam for 2) where he sharpened his skills on the decks and learned the 
importance of reading a crowd. This eventually led into production where 
he finds solace in both house and techno genres; as evident by his 
releases on Berettamusic that have a defined techy edge as well as his 
funky and quirky house sound which can be heard on his newly signed "With 
You" track to Colorecordings in the Spring of 04'. He also records with 
Kage under the alias "Airport Society" where he brings out a deeper and 
more minimal approach to his sound. Look for great things from Ryski as 
his funk infused brand of techno-house edges it's way out of Detroit  and
into spots worldwide.


KAGE - BerettaMusic/Azure Records/Lumina Records/www.djkage.com - Detroit, MI
Brian Kage (Pronounced Ka-ghei), is a deep tech-house Producer/DJ from 
Detroit. Kage's tracks have been receiving great reviews from his peers 
across the country. He's signed three of his tracks to Adam Jay's Azure 
Records for World-Wide release. Lumina Records in France have also  picked
up six of his tunes for release. Kage's also working on original  tracks &
remixes for labels such as Z'n Recordings, Open Source &  Berettamusic.
Kage has been playing out since '99, with notable appearances  including
Nefarious Booth at DEMF'01, DEMF'02, DEMF'03, legendary Detroit  club
Motor, Necto in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Duotone in Los Angeles,  California,
& the Azure Records Night in Indianapolis, Indiana. Expect this  rising
star to soon be visible around the globe..

wondering if anyone had any tips on what to hit while I'm there.  Seems the 
spammers have attacked google for raves/clubs so its all crap that I hate 
wading through.  any links would also be appreciated.

Jaded? Who's jaded?

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} New Orleans Rave/club info?


> I go there once a year and I always ask this question and no one ever
helps me so I will help you with what I have found myself.  I have found New
Orleans to not be a very "ravey" city (but I've never been to a real party
there just the clubs).
>
> As far as parties they seem to be limited to the State Palace Theater
where they have the Zoolu parties (during Mardi Gras) among others
throughout the year.  If there are parties going on elsewhere there is
little info about them on the web and the mailing lists for that part of the
country have really dried up (makes pb-cle look like Manchester).
>
> This is going to sound weird but check the schedule of the House of Blues.
Last time I was there Goldie and the Crystal Method had just been there.
Just get there REALLY early and eat so you can be inside next to the stage.
It is the size of an average restaurant so it is very intimate when acts of
that caliber play (and big names are there almost every single night along
with smaller acts).
>
> If you like house and techno your best bet is Club Ampersand on the
weekend (esp. Saturday).  During weeknights it is VIP only with a very
dubious practice of making it 21 and over for men and only 18 and over for
wom... girls.  The building itself is gorgeous, a renovated bank I believe.
The 735 Club (and a few others) on Bourbon Street have techno/house/trance
on some nights but the atmosphere is very mixed because of the huge amount
of people just walking in off of Bourbon Street to peek behind one more
door.
>
> I don't like trance so I have ignored and forgotten anything I learned
about trance nights.
>
> There are a few clubs on the "gay" end of Bourbon Street (the end furthest
from Canal St. - you won't miss it) that typically have dance music of
varied sorts but you have to be open minded.  Some of them are very much
mostly gay and some of them are very mixed with gay, straight, etc. so if
you aren't cool with that now you know.
>
> If you like industrial STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL DUNGEON CLUB.
It looks like a couple of high school kids went to Spencer's to decorate
their room with "gothic" things like plastic gargoyles and black lights.
Ooooooo!  Seriously, the place is kind of shaped neat and it has the coolest
bathroom in New Orleans (good luck finding it) but the music selection sucks
and the dancefloor was an afterthought.  Of course if you want to feel
REALLY good about your dancing skills this is the place to go and show off.
Everyone there does the depressed gothic back and forth dance or else they
are up against the wall.
>
> There is a whole string of clubs just outside of the French Quarter in an
area called the Faubourg Marigny (had to Google the name).  I think it is
all on Frenchmen Street but don't quote me on that.  Anyway, you can club
hop there, it is a big mix of stuff.
>
> I think that is about it for electronic music.  There are a few clubs I
didn't mention because I don't remember the names and their schedules were
all trance.  I've never seen any jungle down there.
>
> I do recommend that you check out Big Al Carlson next door to the Tropical
Isle.  Get a seat up front and be prepared to be entertained.  He sings the
blues but I find them to be rather happy blues.

FESTIVAL
2004 only 45 days away!  All international and regional artists are 
confirmed.
PLEASE NOTE: The deadline for Early-Bird Registration ($75) for GMSF2K4

Now we are 7!!!  While being overwhelmed with festival pre-production 
matters,
we inadvertently missed our 7th year anniversary!  It has been a great 
"dance"
so far, even though the draconian conditions in the USA have made things
increasingly difficult at times…  Onward to 2012!!!

Namaste,

Gaian Mind Monthly

Philly's Premier Psychedelic Trance Party!

Special Guest:

S.O.T.
(http://synchronous.home.comcast.net / http://www.touchsamadhi.com - 
Chicago)
midnight-2am
Igor was transplanted from across the ocean nine years ago. While
studying,  he
uncovered the ancient magic of Goa/Psychedelic Trance. The music lured him
 in,
rewired his brain and changed the nature of the learning experience. Based
 in
Chicago, he began playing/producing with one goal in mind "...to see more 
people
go ape-shit on a dance floor!  …lose themselves and get reborn…" Igor is
extending the T.O.U.C.H Samadhi healing energy to the Midwest; using
soaring leads and swinging baselines that are sure to keep you
"oscillating" well  into
the night...

Resident DJ:

CHAD
(Global Binj Boys, Botswana) 9am-midnight
Chad (aka DJ DADDY 2B) opens the night with a bandolier of fresh music
from  his
recent travels to Goa and Thailand...

totally ... i'm a total sell-out ... yuengling never gave a dime ... miller 
lite will ... plus we'll get free  promotions, some free stuff to hand out 
(t-shirts, shot glasses, etc) and the occasional visit from the miller lite 
girls.

four years with this club night/weekly and we never took any kind of 
sponsership for the night but then again i've gone four years without 
charging a cover - this is just a new road to try out - to get some extra 
funds - and to get more people to check us out ...

and hey Kool cigarettes is 'backing' us too ... Kool and Pall Mall ... now 
there is a marketing/promotional leap.  I see our new slogan already:
"Thursdays@Havana - it's cool ... but like ... with a k"

alright ... i'll shut up now.

Mike C is selling his intelligent lights

for 850 you get:

4 Chauvet intelligent lights(not sure of the exact model number)
1 portable lighting truss with trees
4 dmx cables
1 controller

this setup was well over 1500 when purchased new.

anyone that was at field day last year saw these lights at the poo-bah's =
stage until the rain that was leaking into the tent blew the lamps...the =
lights are in perfect condition...all fixtures have new lamps with fewer =
than 10 hours of use on them...and all the fixtures were serviced by the =
factory after field day.

if anyone is interested email me and ill get u in touch with Mike


this is going up on ebay next week, so if u are interested act NOW.

It's not about selling out, it's about some corporation giving 
money cause they think they can touch a demographic... i wouldnt 
care where the money came from, it helps you bring in bigger 
acts / better finance the night... it's better than skillet where 
we are sponsored by 'tom cox earwax removal system' (see ad 
below)... but can't you still sell yuenglings for 2 dollars and 
just not call it a drink special?  :o)

that you think will be popular, but far too popular for your isp's
bandwidth limits, you can just serve it as
http://freecache.org/http://your.site/yourfile instead of the traditional
http://your.site/yourfile and Freecache will do all the heavy lifting for
you. Plus your users get the advantage of swiftly pulling the file from a
nearby cache rather than it creeping off your overloaded webserver."

Subject: {pb-cle} Noel Sanger is Friday, May 21

Tickets are now available at Grand Poo-Bas Record Shoppe in addition to
headrushmusic.com and groovetickets.com

Friday, May 21

NOEL SANGER (noelsanger.com, Gravity Music Group, Nettwerk)

Noel's music is getting more attention than ever, with some, like
Bedrock's Jonathan Lisle, calling him " One of the top three in the
world right now". Even as his touring, production and remix commitments
persist in intensity, he maintains a schedule like no other; He is also
a dedicated father of two small boys, and an instructor at the acclaimed
Full Sail Center for the Recording Arts in Orlando, FL. Currently he is
in pre-production on an as-yet-unnamed live band/electronic
rock-oriented project fronted by himself and frequent collaborator/wife
Dauby. Their album should be finished in middle of 2004, and several
labels are already expressing interest. 

With dance releases forthcoming on labels from Tokyo to London, two new
full-length albums in production, and a new DJ mix comp due in 2004,
Noel's momentum appears unstoppable. And with both international DJ
engagements and a new  live band touring soon, he has only just begun to
deliver on the promise of his career's first decade. One can only
imagine what he will do with his second. 

with additional sets by:
 
Deviant (HeadRush Music, Toes in the Sand Recordings)
Jason Soditch (cloud 9 resident)
 
cloud 9 
1299 west 9th st
warehouse district, cleveland, ohio
9pm-4am :: $10 :: 21+

Was a good night.  First time at karma.  It was good, although having 
hip hop right in the middle of trance/techno/breaks/house/whatever 
and DnB just didn't make sense to me. Ohh well.  I took a bunch of 
pics that I'll get up eventually.  Quote of the night "I had to pay 
6.00 for parking because I got too much of a ghetto booty to park 
further away" :)

Well, lets gives this puppy a test run:

http://freecache.org/http://svr2.vrillusions.com/pb-cle/Moby%20-
%20Blue%20Man%20Group%7b2001%20Grammies%7d.avi

or the tinyurl version if it will work:
http://tinyurl.com/2avyh

It's Moby's "Blue" performed with the blue man group at the grammy's. 
 About 13 mb.  RR sucks at uploads and it's capped at 40k, and I'm 
already using about 20k on soulseek and whatnot.  so if you get 
anything about 25k your probably getting it from cache or if it's 
above 40 you definitely are.  Feel sorry for the first person that 
has to download it, they'll get the slow speed.

After futher study, looks like the link has to be coming from a web 
page, so try this instead:

http://svr2.vrillusions.com/pb-cle/freecachetest.html

(btw, it's 40mb, my bad)

Subject: {pb-cle} Beat Matrix 05.17.2004 | wruw fm 91.1

This week Optomas will be returning to the Beat Matrix.  He's just gotten
back from a weekend in LA spinning records with Kenny Larkin, Hyperactive,
and Keneth Graham (big techno names).  Expect a slick set with some crazy
Optomas-esque stories after the mix!

I'm still out of town so DJ Vitruvius of the Raver's Edge and DJ Moose will be covering
for me again.

The website won't be updated until I get back, but I'll those setlists
posted as soon as I do.

And do let us know if the Beat Matrix Crew or WRUW can support you in anyway.

Cheers.

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Set by North Carolina's, Blue Spectral Monkey now on Zia-Trance]

Zia-Trance is now featuring a mix by North Carolina’s, Blue Spectral
Monkey  that speaks of an emergence into higher realms of mental
distortion. Ancient  principles reveal themselves through electronic
shamanism.  Altered states  and healing energies are the palette of his
creation.

Masterful mixing in combination with spiritual awareness make this a must 
listen.
It’s a live recording from his set at the monthly party in Boston, called 
Psyforia, on 3/19/04.
You should definitely check it out.

It airs everyday at 2 PM EST and then again for the rewind at 10 PM EST.
You  can check the scheduler on the main station page to see the times it
airs in  your area. It converts the times for you.

It will air from 5/17 to 5/30.

Good luck in your pursuits,
Bob Trahpek

The Third Eye V.5 - Techno Version
Presented by Goahead Productions

Friday, Aug, 2004 - Cleveland, OH

Goahead productions continues The Third Eye ritual. Don't miss this
soulful experience as we get deep into the roots!

Trevor Lamont - Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com
aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands. He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about
the sounds of house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony
Humphies, Lil Louie Vega, and Frankie Knuckles. Eventually he got his own
tables and decided to take that step on the other side of the table.
Through years of decication and practice to his form he has made himself
into a very accomplished house D.J. Trevor has traveled all over sharing
his unique style of mixing house. His style is very mix intensive. If you
watch him you'll notice that he's constantly in the mix and that helps to
bring about nice textured and thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets
are usually very sexy and deep. He can pump it up though and has been know
to drop the occasional surprise techno sets.

RYSKI - BerettaMusic/ColorRecordings/www.ryski.com - Detroit, MI

Ryski currently resides in Detroit where he owns and operates the 
Berettamusic record label with Brian Kage. His productions have been 
described as techy, funky and sometimes off the wall which seems to mirror
his  quirky attitude. He lived overseas for 5 years (Japan for 3 years and
 Guam for 2) where he sharpened his skills on the decks and learned the
importance of reading a crowd. This eventually led into production where 
he finds solace in both house and techno genres; as evident by his 
releases on Berettamusic that have a defined techy edge as well as his 
funky and quirky house sound which can be heard on his newly signed "With 
You" track to Colorecordings in the Spring of 04'. He also records with 
Kage under the alias "Airport Society" where he brings out a deeper and 
more minimal approach to his sound. Look for great things from Ryski as 
his funk infused brand of techno-house edges it's way out of Detroit  and
into spots worldwide.


KAGE - BerettaMusic/Azure Records/Lumina Records/www.djkage.com - Detroit,
MI Brian Kage (Pronounced Ka-ghei), is a deep tech-house Producer/DJ from 
Detroit. Kage's tracks have been receiving great reviews from his peers 
across the country. He's signed three of his tracks to Adam Jay's Azure 
Records for World-Wide release. Lumina Records in France have also  picked
up six of his tunes for release. Kage's also working on original  tracks &
remixes for labels such as Z'n Recordings, Open Source &  Berettamusic.
Kage has been playing out since '99, with notable appearances  including
Nefarious Booth at DEMF'01, DEMF'02, DEMF'03, legendary Detroit  club
Motor, Necto in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Duotone in Los Angeles,  California,
& the Azure Records Night in Indianapolis, Indiana. Expect this  rising
star to soon be visible around the globe..

Subject: {pb-cle} nrr: W in deep doo doo...

i just happened upon this little snippet of info....

This past Sunday, Colin Powell was on Meet the Press with Tim Russert.

Here's a nifty little recap of the interview that I think some of you will love:
-------------
Referring to his Feb. 5, 2003 appearance before the UN's Security Council when he argued that Iraq
had or was close to developing WMD, including biological weapons, Powell told Russert the
information he offered was not only wrong, but that in some cases the intelligence cited by the
administration had been purposefully misleading.

"It turned out that the sourcing was inaccurate and wrong and in some cases, deliberately
misleading," Powell said. "And for that, I am disappointed and I regret it."

The statement marks a major turning point for the administration, which has admitted intelligence
was inaccurate, but never that it had "deliberately" offered false intelligence or that such
intelligence may have been willfully manipulated.

On Monday, the New York Times' lead story on Powell's comments began: "Secretary of State Colin
Powell has said for the first time that he now believes that the Central Intelligence Agency was
deliberately misled about evidence that Saddam Hussein was developing unconventional weapons."
-------------
Colin. Fucking. Powell.

Ouch.

Oh, and by the way...lest any of you think I'm pulling that little tidbit from some Communist-loving
Liberal hippie-rag...That quote is from an article on newsmax.com, one of the more "conservative
leaning" online news outlets....right next to ads for Bush/Cheney 04 gear and "W" lapel pins with
the american flag on 'em.

http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/5/17/211348.shtml

TRUTH IS FUN!

i was totally gonna order this but then i read this part:

"Then I began to outline a system that would teach any DJ (as long 
as they know how to beatmix), how to increase their DJ bookings 
and make more money."

i never realized that beatmatching was actually important so i 
never learned how to do it. oh well, no pro deejaying for me. 
darn.

Subject: {pb-cle} nrr: More on the Google Email front


Over the last couple of days, Lycos & Spymac have been in the news for 
offering 1gb of email space.  Lycos you have to pay $5-6 bucks a month, but 
spymac (an apple afficianado site) is offering 1gb + 350mb of other space if 
you sign up there.  Actually Spymac news is a bit dated (happened in mid 
April)

http://www.spymac.com/user.php?action=login (can't relocate the article i 
read - but info is here)

of course to trump this, Google... quietly... increased user limits to 1tb 
(terabyte) of space - 1000 times more than originally offered.  This 100 
times more than the average PC user's harddisk space.  It's unclear if this 
will be for all users but we'll see.

Lycos info: http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-5214626.html

Google 1tb info: http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39155158,00.htm

If anyone wants to try it, they're more than welcome to.  Hell, I'll admit 
I've been tempted - (although I'd rather find it at a library or book store 
to thumb through) I'm sure (as goose said) there is lots of good info 
contained in his book.  I was more referring to the marketing tactics he's 
employing, if the information has any actual merit.

Have a private party I'm playing tomorrow. They want top 40. I vomit,

who's actually paying for the thing and could care less what I do.

Now, do I go with them, or a techno shock and awe campaign? It's

Personally, I'd just do what they want. It'll be a lot less painful for you in the "let's have a
little talk about what you're playing" department.

I sympathize...I do it every friday and saturday....but hey, money's money, and you were hired for a
specific purpose.

THE NOVAMEN 
DJ OVERDOSE 
+ IKARI BAKUDAN 
+ JWAN ALLEN 
 
@ THE GARFIELD ARTWORKS 
$8PM 
$10 
ALL AGES 

Come out and see the Novamen in their Pittsburgh debut, before 
they grace the stage at Movement =9204 Detroit=92s Electronic Music 
Festival.
 
Propaganda: 


Novamen - With a string of underground hits on Murder Capital 
records, The Hague's Novamen have made an impact in the 
misunderstood realm of European electro. DJ Overdose and Ingmar 
Pauli have strayed far from the superficial gloss often associated 
with the genre, turning out darker, heavier tracks with a strong 
techno influence. "I just don't think we make that commercial kind 
of music," explains Overdose. "It's not about being underground or 
anything, it's just that when we sit together by ourselves, this 
is what comes out." 
Surprised to find that Overdose and I had diverse preferences in 
common, we chatted about 2 Live Crew, the RZA, Christopher Walken, 
Sea Lab 2021 and Schooly D. "I like a lot of hip-hop but 
sometimes, with Mobb Deep for example, after a while the lyrics 
don't make me scared, they just make me want to laugh." 
It's refreshing to hear an artist mention techno and hip-hop in 
the same sentence, two genres with much in common which rarely 
mesh nowadays. "When I was 10 or 11, we got a tape with two mixes, 
Grandmaster Flash and Electric Kingdom. I never heard anything 
like it. At the time it was electro and hip-hop, so that's what I 
stayed with." 
"We basically grew up together, so we listen to a lot of the same 
things," Pauli contributes, "but later on I quit hip-hop and went 
a little bit further with the new wave electro. I'm always 
listening to old stuff, nothing new, nothing in the electro 
world."  Article by Steve Lalla - Hour.ca 2003

About DJ Overdose:
Born: 1971, The Hague, Holland
Been hooked to Hip Hop ever since Grandmaster Flash's "The 
Message" and the Freeze Force's "Boogie Down Bronx". Producing 
since age twenty and DJ-ing since age sixteen. Producing beats for 
The Hague rappers. Residential DJ at the Netsotov (Hip Hop 
Coffeeshop).Performed live in Barcelona at Sonar Festival and at 
the Lowlands Festival (Holland). Have been DJ-ing in Barcelona, 
Zurich, Berlin, Amsterdam and Brussels.  From: Global Darkness

Ikari Bukudan (Technoir Audio) =96 Hands down, Ikari is the electro 
don dada of the infamous Technoir Audio crew. Through his great 
relationship with the Rush hour record store (Amsterdam) and his 
vast knowledge of all things funky; Ikari has amassed what just 
might be the finest collection of electro records in the city of 
Pittsburgh. Come out and witness a master in his craft working the 
decks. Ikari has spun alongside likeminded electro pioneers, 
Legowelt, Luke Eargoggle, Magas, and Bangkok Impact 

Jwan Allen is by far the 412 area code's top Techno guru. His 
signature mixes of electronic soul have been a mainstay in the 
Pittsburgh scene, weaving dance genres as diverse as broken beat, 
deep house, new wave, ital disco, and 80's electrofunk. Co-founder 
of the internationally acclaimed Technoir Audio music label and 
one of the organizers of element 5's Momentum series, Jwan Allen 
has been found DJing alongside other globetrotting DJs/artists 
such as Carl Craig, Titonton Duvante, Moonstarr, Domu, Anthony 
Shakir, Dan Bell, Daniel Wang, Shawn Rudiman and Detroit's 
infamous electronic duo Adult.

I tend to agree with this outlook.

When I'm rocking out, I'll mix in something from what I'd play at one of my non-mainstream type gigs
and people usually dig it.

You'll get comments here and there or "the nod" from people who know what's up and are into it.

Subject: {pb-cle} Charles Feelgood tonight- PGH

I don't know how many people know about this since it is a Service Industry 
Party thrown by Camel Cigarettes ... I had no idea about this until I got my 
invite yesterday ...

tonight at Sanctuary is the Camel Speakeasy Tour featuring:

Charles Feelgood
Scooter & Lavelle
The Atomic Bombshell Burlesque Dancers
Green Eggs and Spam

I just called the club and they said the doors open at 9pm / 21+ / $3 cover 
if not on the list

might check it out ... though these parties tend to be a little too 
top40/mainstream and cheesy for me.  at least the crowd they draw will be.

I am playing at this club tommorow and they wanna hear hiphop. I spin breaks, but I am gonna bust out all these old hiphop break remixes and mix them in with more underground shit. I'll guess we'll see what happens. Technically speaking if someone pays you for something you should give them what they paid for.....and more.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Charles Feelgood tonight- PGH

Yeah, fuck corporate sponsored music events!

If it werent for corporate sponsors, there wouldn't be a lot of larger
shows.  If you or I wanted to bring in charles, we'd have to charge more
than a 3 dollar cover. 

I guess you hate havana too, right?  Since kool cigarettes are one of the
sponsors?  What does it matter if it's a tour or a weekly event.  Fuck the
corporations, take their money, provide better talent at a lower cost.
That's what it's about... If you want to take up a cause due to moral
convictions, check out peta.org, they'd probably lick your asshole cause
it's all organic.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Charles Feelgood tonight- PGH


the cigarette company's have to be able to advertise somehow...shit after 
2005 they wont be allowed to publicly advertise their product anywhere 
because of the world ban on tobacco advertising...this may singlehandely 
kill motorsport as we know it(not counting nascar)...especially in the 
better formula racing series...cart, irl, and F1 will be hit hardest...but 
motogp, motocross, touring car, drag, and rally racing all depend on 
cigarette advertising to keep the teams heads above water.

personally i could care less what they do...the cigarette sponsored shows 
are usually free or insanely cheap to get into considering who they are 
bringing in(the roots for free...thanks kool)....and they usually have nice 
sound and lights....the best part is...i dont even smoke cigarettes.


Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

NOEL SANGER (noelsanger.com, gravity music group, nettwerk) 


"One of the top three in the world right now."-- Jonathan Lisle, Bedrock
Records 


>>From our exclusive interview with Noel: 


HR: Many of your interviews from 2002 referred to your take on
progressive as saying that it's "...not necessarily a genre, but an
attitude...Taking chances, moving forward, being subtle rather than
obvious." How have you continued to progress musically, and what can
your listeners expect from you in 2004? 


NS: The reality is that statement was a contextual response to the
previous two years where progressive came to be synonymous with this
deep, tribally, plodding sound. A thousand identical records a week were
coming out. Having been really focused in on a sound called progressive,
and all its various permutations, since about 1993, I just couldn't get
my head around THIS as the exclusive genre definition of progressive. I
think that the tide has turned and now most DJ's are playing a more
diverse sound: breaks, melodies, etc. So to actually answer your
question, that is the direction I was moving in 2 or 3 years ago and
have continued on that way. Basically everything I've always been into,
but I am more integrated stylistically than I ever have been before. I
don't play big 140 bpm trance tunes, but you'll hear plenty of the best
elements of trance. You'll also hear techy bits, and housey bits, and
you'll hear breaks. I have always liked breaks since my first breaks
releases nearly ten years ago and today there are more exciting things
happening in the (progressive) breaks scene than anywhere else. 


HR:What should we promoters and record labels be doing to turn on more
people and wider audiences to the progressive sounds? 


NS: Variety, Diversity, Less rules. No more sets that require a headful
of something to "get." I think the musical snobbery of the "prog" scene,
eschewing certain sounds as "cheese," has really hurt our standing in
the dance world. Not that there isn't cheese, but at the end of the
night, it's about dancing and having fun. I like to play music that
maybe has some deeper or spiritual connotations to it, but ultimately,
spirituality is just the bouquet, the flowering of ordinary life and
nothing celebrates life more completely than un-self-consciously dancing
and losing your cares in the music. Its all about celebration and fun
and less about chin stroking and trainspotting!

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight@Havana - SHAWN RUDIMAN

THURSDAYS @ HAVANA
Tonight 05.20.04

[d.c. SPACE] - 10pm & 1am - Deep House

[SHAWN RUDIMAN]- 11pm - 1am - First ever DJ set at Havana - Techno/Electro 
www.technoiraudio.com

TV & Projector Visuals by [LAB TYPE ZERO] - Live Motion Composers - 
www.labtypezero.com

10pm - 2am
NO COVER / 21+ / I.D. Required

***SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT***

Well, it took a little longer than expected, but we are finally ready to 
release the first issue of "Big Straw" to CMU, the greater Pittsburgh area, 
and the globe.

There will be two release parties for the magazine this Thursday, May 20, 
2004:

The first will be outside Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill, 5874 Forbes, from 
5-6 pm.

The second will be at Club Havana in Shadyside (5744 Ellsworth) starting at 
10pm (this is 21+), w/ special appearance by Japanese underground video 
jackers Laboratory Type-0, and international techno DJ Shawn Rudiman.

What is "Big Straw?"  A new magazine dealing with underground Asian and 
Asian American culture.  But don’t expect to get any clear definitions of 
what those terms mean here, because we aren’t tour guides.  Our mission 
isn’t to define culture, but to explode it, locating fragments of identity 
and meaning in film, music, anime, literature, fashion, car culture, sports, 
toys, and so on.  Rather than fix things, we want to put them in motion.  
Rather than erect borders, we want to sneak across them.  Like the 
automotive subculture of “drifting," we want to move sideways as fast as we 
can.

Hope to see you!
John Ep.

u know what else bothers me about this? and nobody
seems to ever mention it...what's with this idea that
iraq shouldn't have weapons? we have them! everybody
has them! can we really say- "nobody likes you, you're
not allowed to be able to defend yourself, if you try
to make the game fair, we'll emancipate your race from
this realm." what the hell? of course they want to
have weapons, it's only logical, and it's only fair.
if we're really so great, we wouldn't need to worry
about those ppl. obviously we have a little insecurity
about our real "power," because it's nothing but
intimidation and massive political/social/economical
enginerring, not superiority. our superiority is david
copperfield, and the actions of our leadership
certainly indicate that they know it better than
anybody. what a laugh. sorry i had to get that one
off.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Dreamhost

This is in regards to hosting Goose's file, but also seeking information
from you cats who are using Dreamhost. Can someone please contact me
privately about a couple things? I have been checking out Dreamhost's
online support documentation, but haven't been successful in finding the
following details:

1) Once I create an additional user account with ftp access, how do I go
about giving read/write privileges to specific directories? I am willing
to offer up the space where Goose can host the SupahStar DJ pdf document.
So far it looks like this account has the same rights as my main admin
account. Maybe its a little paranoid of me, but there is no way in hell I
am going to send a username/password with that level of access to a public
list. In the meantime, I am going to be working on a simple submission
form so that he can browse to the local file, and upload it to me via php
page.

2) I am trying to set up a MySQL database, beginning very simply. I am
comfortable with database administration, transactional SQL, and PL/SQL
types of commands. Its the real bootstrap junk that I am having trouble
with. What client applications / webpage urls will let me enter the code
to execute operations such as creating tables, etc?

Anyone who can give me some insight into these things would be
ultra-funkular. Thanks so much!

I know you wanted a private response, but the mysql part may be of 
benefit to others.  phpmyadmin baby.  DH even has it installed at 
their pad, but I installed it myself as well.  Works great, too great 
actually since I want to get mysql certified and am having trouble 
remembering the create syntax and stuff :)  it's 
http://www.phpmyadmin.net/  and it's free :)

I think I've gotten the ftp question taken care of.

FTP: teamshocker.com
User: shockerftp
Pass: shock1

Remote directory: /ftp/ (or you can just navigate there)

Still interested in some MySQL setup details for anyone who can offer
suggestions.

Gracias

Attenion all DJs: 
Klublife/Tranceaddict.com/WEMF 2004 New Talent Tent 

We are proud to announce that this year Klublife and
Tranceaddict have come on board to present the MASSIVE
new up and comers tent! Tranceaddict.com, based in
Toronto, has grown to become the largest electronica
website in the world - with over 33,000 members
globally. www.klublife.com is Canada¹s leading
electronic music and lifestyle monthly. As in previous
years, this tent will showcase the skills of those
that have advanced from their bedroom DJ roots and are
ready for the next step! We have gone all out with the
preparations - that's right - better sound, light &
décor for '04! 

If you are interested in getting an hour to showcase
your talent at the largest event of its kind in North
America then put together a phat demo tape, CD or DVD
and send it along with WEMF2004 advance ticket proof
of purchase (ie. photocopy clearly showing ticket
number or Ticketmaster/Tripledecks.com confirmation
code in your name) to: Tranceaddict/Klublife New
Talent Tent, P.O. Box 757, Station C, Toronto, Ont.
M6J 3S1. All those selected to perform in the New
Talent Tent will have their advance ticket purchase
REFUNDED at the gate upon entry. 

We are looking for ALL TYPES of electronic dance
music, so whether you play tranced-out harmonic
breakbeat or hardcore ambient jungle, we wanna hear
it! As an added bonus - to celebrate the 10th
anniversary of WEMF one lucky DJ will have their live
set featured for download on TA - giving them
far-reaching exposure long after their WEMF set is
done! 

Selected artists will have their names posted on the
official WEMF website (www.wemf.com), the official
TRANCEADDICT website (www.tranceaddict.com) and listed

Subject: {pb-cle} tonight

"I like to play music that maybe has some deeper or spiritual connotations to it, but ultimately, spirituality is just the bouquet, the flowering of ordinary life and nothing celebrates life more completely than un-self-consciously dancing and losing your cares in the music. It's all about celebration and fun and less about chin stroking and trainspotting!  " --Noel Sanger

See you on the dance floor!

NOTE: The club will only stay open until late (4am) if the party's jumpin', so get there early and dance your ass off.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} secrets of a succe$$ful pro dj

At this point, I'm still dealing with a bunch of bull jive. My main ftp
login can't see whats in the shockerftp account. You'll still be able to
grab it, and everything else that goes up via ftp as:
ftp://shockerftp:shock1@teamshocker.com/ftp. You can click the new link on
teamshocker.com underneath the link titled "contact"

Through a direct html link, you can go to http://www.teamshocker.com/ftp
and grab the file. I had to actually push that file back up after
downloading it though, so new uploads won't be available there. There are
still some issues I am working out, but next step will be a php page that
allows direct uploads to a web accessible directory.

Unfortunately the last couple days have been dedicated to loose women,
mixed drinks, and several semi-shady off-topics. Legitimate coding will
simply have to take a back seat to my current behavior. Please bear with
me, as I am trying to prioritize the activities that I spend my time on.

Jay's been playing some really phat, twisted tech and prog with us for

giving him a hell of a party tonight...

SNAP BACK SUNDAYS...
This is our way of filling in the void between the highly anticipated

2-4 djs who have been supportive of the 10-10 project from the beginng .  We
have a had a lot of talent through, and look forward to these extended sets
every sunday during the summer to let you experience just a little bit more
than a 1 hour set can provide.   Weather permitting, djs will be playing on
the sidewalk for an intimate outdoor patio setting.   Get there early to
claim your table on the patio!   Absolutely free!!!

I do also have all the wav files and video files that came on the cd (443 MB

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} secrets of a succe$$ful pro dj

They're showing OLD episodes of Mr. Wizard on the Science Channel all
weekend, I got one episode on my DVR of him scientifically explaining how a
turntable works. Will put on minidisc soon. Every weekend for the next few
weekends they'll be repeating these, so if you get the science channel, tune
in and sample away.

One of Cleveland's finest House specialists, Semaj, will be providing the live mix.  He serisously knows how to bring pressure to the dance floor;get ready to start shakin' it wherever you happen to be while listening to the show ; )
 
 Happy-fun-time starts at 10:30; set your dials to 91.1 fm (or point your browsers to wruw.org) and enjoy the show : )

Its on topic because Survivor - Eye of the Tiger is probably the greatest

Subject: {pb-cle} skillet! thanks


big thanks to everyone who came out to skillet last
night as always it was a great time! 

special thanks to [mark] for filling in for selecta
who couldn't make it out, turned out to be a blessing.

ed got played a nice opening set of classic house and
some broken beat, then
[mark] killed it in every way with a sweet set that
went from electro to 80's dance to synth-pop to broken
beat and ended up with some killer dub action, some or
most of which being his own productions. that was a
set i dug the whole way through, and it was all mixed
properly to boot! big upp!

so next week we'll be closed on account of movement,
but we'll be back june 6th w/ zemo and mike bee,
pittsburgh alumni returning from san fran! see ya then


=)

OK, I'm starting to become more geared towards getting away from the 
proprietary IM services out there.  Sooooo, I finally got around to 
setting up my jabber address (btw, you dreamhost people can set it up 
for your domain :) ).  So if you use jabber, or thinking about it, 
you can add my boring self to your list.  It's very simple, just my

Subject: {pb-cle} classic techno help...

hey gang...
i found this while searching through soulseek...it's basically a comp with tracks from the holy
trinity of detroit (atkins/may/saunderson) along with a couple others, but apparently these songs
are really really scarce these days...

so...1) does anyone know if this comp is still in print? or 2) where i would begin to look for these
tracks (other than jwan's record bag) to purchase on vinyl?

RetroTechno/EmotionsElectric (Network Records 1991)
Maybe this album should be mentioned first as it presents the oldest music in this list. Tracks on
this compilation are all from 1988 or before, and include many at that time very hard to find
classics, including Clear by Cybotron from 1982 (!), and obscure Transmat and KMS tracks. The
compilation opens with No UFOs, from 1985, from the first Metroplex release. A main role for Derrick
May on this compilation, (including the long beatless version of Strings of Life), further on
classics by Kevin 'Reese' Sauderson, with 'The groove that won't stop' and 'Just another chance',
also the smooth 'When we used to play' with Blake Baxter. And again, as used to by Rushton and
McCready a nice informative booklet included.  (from http://www.forcefield.org/ten.html)

tracklist:

1. No UFO's - Model 500 (8:26)
2. Just Another Chance - Reese (5:10)
3. Freestyle - Mayday (5:42)
4. The Dance - Rhythim Is Rhythim (7:12)
5. R-Theme - R-Tyme (6:21)
6. Clear - Cybotron (4:55)
7. Rock To The Beat - Reese (4:03)
8. First Bass - Seperate Minds (3:55)
9. When We Used To Play (unreleased mix) - Blake Baxter (6:07)
10. Let's Go - X Ray (9:31)
11. The Groove That Won't Stop - Kevin Saunderson (7:38)
12. Strings Of Life (unreleased mix) - Rhythim Is Rhythim (8:23)

Subject: {pb-cle} Burblife

The other week a friend of mine passed me a cd. Its called Burb Life. The
shit is too sweet. Its a very talented MC - Troy Walsh aka Mr. Unlikely,
who keeps it real the only way he knows how. From the site:

"Your very own chic, country-clubbing musical messiah. Volvo-driving,
gator-shirted, upper-middle-class bohemia. Pure privilege. The palest
thing on two feet."

Its a riot because it's not like any hip-hop you've heard, but tight as
hell. So many white, suburban boys try to be ghetto without having the
first clue about it. Troy flows over top of Lieutenant Dan's beats talking
about cookouts and country clubbin. At one point he says "if you paid for
this cd, you got chumped" and encourages you to distribute it.

I talked to him a couple times via email, and he seems real cool. Said
that anyone who goes to his site, and signs up for the "Street Team" will
get a free cd. I asked him to ftp me some mp3s, which are still on my
server, but you can get streaming audio from his site.

Yeah, I guess I am swinging a little bit, but fuck it. This biz is brilliant.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} anyone know anything about drum synthesis?

It's complex ;p  More complex then normal synthesis infact because the
harmonics aren't in a (simple) set pattern like with wavforms.  Sound on
sound did some synthesis articles and some of them referred to drum
synthesis.

http://tinyurl.com/2agfo

Personally I would work with attack or that other soft drum machine that
fails to come to mind at this point.  Or pick up a er-1 on ebay for like 150
bucks.  Start playing with those knobs on screen or off and think about the
changes in the sound.  Ideally you want to get to a point that you know what
changes will be made when you turn a knob.

technically any synth is the same. i use my old analogues to 
create drum sounds all the time. i actually got a really good 
sounding 808 kick from my mono/poly. all you need is to know how 
to set your envelopes and use an ultra fast attack. obviously you 
can use HPFs to help make a snare along with alot of white noise 
mixed in, and a LPF with the resonance up and the cutoff low and 
no R on any of your envelopes to get a thumping kick.

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 2

BILL PATRICK (112 Crew, Arc)

HeadRush Music personally encountered Bill Patrick at The Miami Winter
Music Conference in March 2003. We found Bill on the Terrace at Space.
Playing after banging sets by Mauro Picotto and Marco Carola, we never
thought we'd have the energy to go on. Not only did we stay 'til close,
we would never forget. In fact, Bill's performance that morning remains
one of the best DJ sets we have ever heard.

Being a resident DJ at New York City's Arc with legends Danny Tenaglia
and Danny Howells would probably be enough for most DJs. But not for
Bill. 

In less than five years of DJing, Bill Patrick has played gigs from
Mexico City, Costa Rica, Chile, Buenos Aires, and on to Spain, Italy,
England, Finland, Norway, and Germany.

He headlined a 3000-person event in Mar Del Plata, Argentina alongside
living legend Ricardo Villalobos. 

He's landed three dream gigs in Ibiza, including a main-floor slot at
the legendary "We Love" party at Space, and two remarkable performances
at Circo Loco and at DC-10, which then landed him gigs at Circo Loco in
Rome and Rimini. 

No techno DJ's dream would be complete without a set in the legendary
techno club Tresor in Berlin. His dream came true on New Year's Eve
2004. What a night!

It's no wonder he has caught the eye of many world class DJ's such as
Lee Burridge and Danny Howells, who mentioned him as "The Best
Undiscovered DJ" in DJ Mag's 2003 Top 100 issue.

Bill Patrick's love and dedication for the music have been the driving
forces behind his rapid success. We share his love and hope you will,
too!

Take a drum sound you like...Flip your audio editor to the spectral 
view (spectrum analyzer) where colors represent the intensity of a 
particular frequency.  Take a look at the frequency content.  Compare 
it to the frequency content of the drum sounds you are making.  This 
might offer some clues.  It has shown me that a punchy kick isn't 
just low-end, especially in the decay.

Do they tend to disappear when you add a bassline?

mixed properly they wouldn't.  You would have to give them both their space.
If you are making kicks with your normal synths then you have lots of
control over things.  With enough modulation you could control all aspects
of the sound.

Like you said (or somebody said) kicks aren't all about sub 20hz data.  You
need some good upper harmonics.  Really anything below 40hz or 50hz is to
deep for most stuff I would say.

Bass requires good upper harmonics as well.  So you will see a trade off in
the mix, either big booming 808 kick or thick rolling basslines rarely both
at the same time (I would be interested to hear some stuff that does both).

Alot of this music is finding sounds that sit well together.  Of course this
is all debatable opinion stuff anywho.

NICE!
I too will be able to attend this event.
I will be up there from saturday thru monday as well.
It would be nice to hang out with fellow listers.
I will be at the ramada inn.  (ghetto) ACK!
Anyone staying at the ramada?
Its in the same building as the city club.
When I went to control 3 a while back, you can hear the UNCE all over the 
hotel.

Mazi is a true renaissance man of house music. A well-traveled DJ, prolific
producer and re-mixer, label owner of Gourmet, Simple Soul Recordings, and
an A&R man with an ear for finding new talent. Reigning from Chicago, but

the sounds of house music. Recording as Mazi, Audio Soul Project, MFO, Mise
en Place and Right Side Reverse, his releases and remixes have appeared on
such labels as NRK, 20/20 Vision, Catalyst, Airtight, Greyhound, Subliminal=
,
Siesta, Guidance, and Eukahouse, to name a few. His =B3journey=B2 style DJ sets
have steadily garnered him a reputation as a true taste maker on the dance

Belgrade, Vancouver, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco.

i'd recommend this movie over the new disco donnie rockumentary.  i hope he 
was more exciting than he was made out to be.  basically they just show a 
bunch of parties that look like any party anyone has been too, and that guy 
dressed up in crazy outfits walking around his party.  party monster shows the 
box they kept the body in and used for a coffee table for a week.  that's what 
i call a party.  

new york club kids used to scare the shit out of me.  they always looked 
very...hungry. 

see you freaks in the D !

So what do you call the parties they threw in the back

Just renegades?

So what is it Jason?

Dark prog house or slow jams and power ballads?

I was thinking about bringing an acoustic guitar and doing Eric Clapton 
impressions...

Seirously though, i don't think its going to be dark prog house! I'll do my 
best to keep it looooounnngeee. Gotta warm it up for master D.C.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} OTT re: current events

Damn good speech. Here is a nice quote:

"In December of 2000, even though I strongly disagreed with the decision
by the U.S. Supreme Court to order a halt to the counting of legally cast
ballots, I saw it as my duty to reaffirm my own strong belief that we are
a nation of laws and not only accept the decision, but do what I could to
prevent efforts to delegitimize George Bush as he took the oath of office
as president. I did not at that moment imagine that Bush would, in the
presidency that ensued, demonstrate utter contempt for the rule of law and
work at every turn to frustrate accountability. So today, I want to speak
on behalf of those Americans who feel that President Bush has betrayed our
nation's trust, those who are horrified at what has been done in our name,
and all those who want the rest of the world to know that we Americans see
the abuses that occurred in the prisons of Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo
and secret locations as yet undisclosed as completely out of keeping with
the character and basic nature of the American people and at odds with the
principles on which America stands. I believe we have a duty to hold
President Bush accountable - and I believe we will."

- President Gore, who no longer has to worry about what the "cool kids" in
the mainstream media think about him, verbally disembowels Preznit
Monkeyface and shit-cans the guts. Fucking awesome!!!

http://www.moveonpac.org/goreremarks052604.html/


I like this rant too, by someone entirely other than Gore:

Jerky; one thing I think you're totally wrong about is in thinking that
electing John Kerry will change anything. The problems facing America go
far beyond the easy dichotomies of left and right. Kerry is one of them.
He's Skull and Bones! There is no discernable difference between the
Republicans and the Democrats. The setting up of a left side and a right
side for people to root for is a ruse. There is no left and right. Only
the establisment, which you call The Powers That Be, and the rest of us.
Voting for John Kerry will not change that. The right you refer to is an
illusion. Name withheld by request

Dear NWBR; The "Right" to which I refer is identifiable. It consists of
grassroots and astroturf interest/activist/lobby groups, the
thinkers/preachers/cult figures who provide these groups with
philosophical/spiritual/political scripture, and the
sugardaddy/underwriters who provide them with money to produce their
propaganda. This activist minority in turn - full of passionate intensity,
as Yeats put it - seek ground troops among however many among the
easily-manipulable, book-learning-disdaining, media-consuming citizens
they can snare with their crude, Scientology-like propaganda.

I don't mean to come off as elitist, but I deal with dozens of these
people every day, in specific relation to politics. They believe many
different things, of course, often to the point of self-contradiction.
Some are single-issue voters (guns, immigration, abortion, etc). Others
are across-the-board zombie sheeple of the most distressingly malleable
variety. But they pretty much all self-identify as "conservatives" in the
sense of the wider "conservative movement" in the context of post-war
American politics.

Of course I agree that false dichotomies are played up for sensationalist
and dishonest reasons. I take this as a given. But it's more complex than
that. There's a lot more going on right now, communication-wise. The Right
hasn't been this vociferous since the days of Father Coughlin and the
America Firsters. There are some very disturbing trends going on. Have you
watched Fox News lately? You don't see anything wrong with it? It doesn't
give you the same weird chill as it does me?

And with all due respect, NWBR, as regards the idea that Democrats are the
same as Republicans… have you been reading the papers lately?! Just
because the Dems aren't fielding a Chomsky/Zinn ticket, that doesn't mean
there aren't serious, substantial policy differences between the two. In
case you hadn't noticed, this isn't your grandpa's GOP anymore. Old-school
Republicans wanted limited government, but still believed in GOOD
government. This bunch of neoconservative fascists believe the
government's only role in society is to keep democracy (i.e. "the rabble")
in line so they can shape the world to their vision without having to
worry about pesky things such as public opinion or the rule of law. I
know, because I've read nearly all their books. They're only doing what
they've been threatening to do for decades, which is setting the stage for
the eventual dismantling of the American government as it has evolved over
the last century, only to start fresh with new principles, which they
claim to be "age-old" principles, because that's what fascists do. And
that's what these people are. Naked fascists. It's becoming clearer by the
day.

In the late 60's after LBJ's insistance on passing landmark civil rights
laws, the Republicans absorbed the worst of the Democrats. Nixon himself
approved something called "the Southern Strategy" (google it) to peel away
the last of the Dixiecrats, racist Democrats from the former Confederate
states, who refused to change with the times. History repeated in the
80's, with hard-line neoconservative Democrats crossing the rhetorical
aisle in droves to join Reagan, because they thought his "Evil Empire"
rhetoric was just the ticket to solving this whole Cold War thing.

Swollen with the evil fruits of their "Southern Strategy" and feeling
bulletproof, the conservative establishment of the 70's self-destructed in
a cloud of venom, secrecy and hubris with Watergate and atrocious
intelligence community abuses in Latin America and elsewhere. In the 80's,
the conservatives opened torture schools and launched brutal secret wars
in Central America, gave us the myriad Iran/Contra scandals, the all but
forgotten "Iraq-gate" scandal, and wealth-favoring economic policies that
led to the kind of devastation not seen since the Great Depression. Today,
we are back on the down-swing of that hideous cycle. Cast-off Democrats,
cynical, profiteering, neocon Devil's Advocates who, in the newly
dumbed-down Republican party, found a perfect bunch of rubes they thought
they could control, have fucked shit up again. With every grind of the
wheel, James Joyce's contention that history is a nightmare from which we
are unable to awaken seems more real.

We are living what happens when the Devil's Advocates win

It is about the club scene that directly evolved into the rave scene.   And
some of the same people were involved!

  It's about the club scene, not the rave scene.

I saw the documentary years ago on HBO when they were
first airing it.  It was pretty intrigueing.  Although
the motion picture was entertaining I found the
documentary to be much more informative and accurate
to the feeling of how things really were.  I think the
movie glamorized the whole thing a bit.  But the best
part was pooperstar krackoki being played my FEZ.  But
as far as evolveing in to the "rave" scene...in the
states that may be true...but cats like Genesis P.
Orridge (Jack The Tab, Psychic TV) beat them to it in
the UK in the 80's with parties like Shoom.  Just my
3.5.

We can argue the orgins of "RAVE" until we're blue in the face.

Just a quick reminder for any of you NOT in Detroit.

TODAY::SUNDAY:: May 30::CLEVELAND
A FREE monthly showcase of Cleveland area dj talent:

10 hours, 10 djs. (part 7)

**This month is our Memorial Day BBQ planned with special return dj
appearances!**


3:30-4:30
DOUG BURKHART
This late addition makes it 11 djs. Setting the mood and testing the
equipment to get the afternoon started right.

4:30-5:30
BRIRI
Briri plays an eclectic mix of music that always entertains and tells a
story. Expect one of his deeper journeys today.


5:30-6:30
MIKE METZ
Cleveland's original deep house souljah. Smooth and soulful will be in
order!

6:30-7:30
CANDICE RADIN
Lady Radin has become an integral part of the Cleveland scene. Her sets
range from breaky to techy to progressive. So come experience one and be
sure to comment on the Prada record bag!

7:30-8:30
ROB BLACK
You never know what to expect with this one... so the description is hard
write. We promise he will not play any Darude!

8:30-9:30
DARBE
If you don't know him by face, then you evidently don't go out. This
oldschool maestro lays down beats all across the board. I've never been
disappointed!

9:30-10:30
JAY SCHAMBERG
Jay's last set in Cleveland before he moves onto new experiences! Another
extremely diverse dj who has managed to entertain me with every set!

10:30-11:30
DJ MOOSE
A Cleveland icon, a Pittsburgh legend, and an all around nice guy bringing
the breaks that will get you jumping out of your seat.

11:30-12:30
REESE
The man, the myth, the candy! Come discover what "Get lost with Reese"
actually means.

12:30-1:30
THOMAR
Our New York connection aka "The Hopper" (and Scene magazine's posterboy for
10-10) returns to Cleveland with his impeccable track selection, skills, and
attitude. Welcome back!

1:30-2:30
CLOUD TEN
The shining light behind EVERY 10-10, Justin's talent does not go without
notice. We look forward to having him close out this event with his usual
style and class!


We'll be spinning inside, because it looks like rain.   However, it looks to
be holding off until 7 or 8.  We'll be BBQing as long as we can :)   Space
is very limited out there and it goes very quickly. Start time is 3:30 pm.
You can go out EARLY and listen to great music if you can't stay out late.
Plus it's FREE!!

There is a "Make your own Bloody Mary Bar" in effect from 1pm on. This is
great hair of the dog, and a good way to start the afteroon. We're also
working on having Mojitos and Sangria for this

We will be BBQing some hotdogs and hamburgers on the patio. We'll be asking
a suggested donation for the meat & buns. If you would like to bring
something to share, please feel free to do so!

All taking place at:

TWIST SOCIAL CLUB
11633 Clifton Blvd.
Cleveland-Lakewood, OH
216.221.2333

**We welcome any other types of artists at these events. If you want to
express yourself, please email doug@poo-bas.com to discuss it. We would like
this to be an open forum for many different types of talent.

** If you are a dj wishing to play these events -- you are required to
attend a few of them and get to know your peers. That's what this is all
about!
