Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} wicked 2.0 (louisville) + cinci

I was out at this show, too.  Most of the music was definately hard.  I agree 
that there were about 400-500 strong.  The promoters I spoke with informed me 
that the crowd can get much bigger, up to a thousand people.

The venue was pretty tight.  Not only did it have two rooms of music but a 
video game room & a room full of pool tables, which suited me well--I'm a bit 
country and like to shoot pool.  Beer was being sold for only $2 a can--that 
also suited me, I like to drink every now and then.  I was also on a tight 
budget, so the cheap price of the beer was very suitable.  

I got word that Irene got into a little bit of a scuffle with one of the DJs 
prior to her set--I think Adam X (forgive me if I got the name wrong.)  She 
wasn't as bad as whoever posted the review explained--I think it's a bit 
bias.  However, Irene did trainwreck pretty bad once.  She switched pretty 
fast, but any DJ could hear that the trainwreck was BAAADD!! Well, at least 
she's human.

I didn't hear Irene too long--there was a DJ spinning some Detroit in the 
second room, and I had to get my freak on with a couple freaks in that room.

I don't care to provide a full review of the party.  It was a good party and I 
had a good time.  With the exception of a few teenagers overdosing on drugs, 
there was no drama.  It was definately worth the 4 hour drive.  The promoters 
did a Hell of a job.  Peace out!!

HULK IS TELLING YOU TO LISTEN UP, PUNY HUMANS

Tomorrow you have to vote for Man-Thing or Monkey Leader.

If puny human readers of diary do not vote, they are making stupid mistake!

CAPTAIN AMERICAN FLAG-MAN SAYS IT IS YOUR DUTY. Hulk thought Hulk's duty was to dry dishes today.

USE YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE. HULK HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR PUNY HUMANS WHO DO NOT VOTE AND THEN WHINE ABOUT
STUPID MONKEY MAKING STUPID DECISIONS OR TREE-MAN HUGGING HIPPIE BABIES.

Subject: {pb-cle} for all the BS non-voters....

My Father's Vision

By Gene Weingarten
Tuesday, November 2, 2004; Page A21

My father, Philip Weingarten, is 90. He wears hearing aids in both ears. At night, before he goes to
bed, he removes them as he stands with his head above an open dresser drawer. That is because, if he
dropped one on the floor, he could never find it. He cannot see the floor.

His right eye sees nothing. The sight that remains in his left eye is so limited that, to read, he
must use a machine that magnifies each letter to the size of a baseball. In this manner, he reads
The Washington Post every day, all day. The retina in his functioning eye is a rubble of scar
tissue, so ravaged from diabetic damage and macular degeneration that his doctor doesn't know how he
sees anything at all. Somehow his brain has learned to cobble together into vaguely recognizable
images the fractured signals from the few neurons that still fire.

When he walks the halls of the assisted-living facility in which he lives, people greet him by name,
but he cannot do the same in return. The friendly blobs are indistinguishable. I have always joked
that my father is the reincarnation of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian
throne. That is because he was born on June 28, 1914, the day the archduke and his pregnant wife
were assassinated, touching off World War I. Ferdinand's dying words were selfless -- concern for
his wife and family -- which pretty much sums up the way my father has lived his life.

Though his eyes have betrayed him, his mind remains as sharp as yours or mine. He was an accountant,
and has attended to his own affairs ably until just last week, when he found he could no longer see
well enough to write checks or keep records. And so my wife and I brought him to the bank, where he
conferred power of attorney on his daughter-in-law. Intending no disrespect, the banker began by
directing questions to my wife and me, but quickly checked herself when my father volunteered not
only his Social Security number but the precise number of his savings account.

He moves in a determined shuffle, behind an aluminum walker. When he ventures outside, he needs a
companion to warn him of the presence of a curb, or a sidewalk anomaly. The ground is a soupy mist
to him, swallowing his legs at the thigh. Daylight can play mischief with his eyesight. Sometimes,
the empty streets before him are aswarm with pint-sized people, or blocked with poplar trees, or are
a landscape of yawning craters. These are the only things he sees in sharp focus, because they
bypass his ruined eyes entirely. They are inventions of his brain, a medical syndrome not uncommon
in people with profound loss of vision. They are hallucinations, but not delusions. He knows they
are unreal; still, it is an act of faith and no small courage to step confidently forward into an
abyss, just because someone you love tells you it is safe.

It is through this foggy soup and minefield of phantasms that my father will walk this afternoon,
with me at his side, into a church in suburban Maryland. There -- as he has done every four years
since he chose Roosevelt over Landon -- he will cast a mathematically insignificant vote for
president of the United States. Because he knows it is the right thing to do.

So, what are you doing today?

but if that happened, we would lose like 40% of the emails on here. =20
another 40% if entropy stopped (although now that the elections are=20

raves, this list would be dead (like it isn't already).

Subject: {pb-cle} Adopt-a-Platoon: Music Needed

At our polling place this morning, there was information posted 
about an Adopt-a-Platoon drive that the kids at the school are 
having.

They're seeking donations of stuff like books, newspapers, music, 
movies, etc. to send a care package to the people serving in 
Iraq.

I thought it would be a great way to represent the scene if we all 
chipped in CDs of mixes to send over.

If you have any you wish to give, please bring them to the booth 
(mark them as being for the Platoon drive) at Moda tonight during 
the Election Returns party and I'll take them to the school this 
week.

Or if you can't make it or live too far, drop them in the mail 
today or tomorrow to:

HeadRush Attn. Amy

half the time i mass delete threads about stupid stuff so i don't know 
whats always going on in them.
i've spiked alot of the waaaayyyyy off topic threads.   thats what the 
OT V2 list is for (go ahead todd & plug it :)

at times i wish michael knight was still around.  i'd almost let 
eviestee back on to watch that silliness again.

okay ace. what can i say? i look at the electoral college, i look
at the bullshit pulled to keep minorities from voting, i look at
the lack of women and minorities running for the top office in the
land, i look at the money from major corporations going to both
the dems and the repubs, i look at the third party candidates that
no one will ever hear of now since nader became a "spoiler" in
2000 in an election where the majority voted for the loser. i look
at all of these things, and then i look at my vote as a vote in
favor of this system. and its just never gonna happen like that.

to prove how unlazy my non-vote was:

i took my grandmother to vote. we vote at the same place. i got
out of the car with her, walked her in, said hello to all the
idiots manning the polls, waited for her, walked out to my car,
got in and left. 

the way i see it, if youve got a brain and have a handle on the
electoral process theres pretty much no way you would be voting.

The way I see it, you play the hand you're dealt.  If a messed up
elections system is all you have, you still play it out, you dont fold
and call misdeal.  This is real life, shit will never be perfect,
especially when all people do is bitch about the system instead of
trying to change it.

As for your comments about tactics used to scare voters or to discount
voters, look and see all the voters in florida who will stand in lines
for hours because they wont let their will be beat.  that's integrity
and that's a value that america needs more of.  look at what happened
up in toledo where that stupid megan harrington is facing multiple
felony charges because she submitted names that sounded ethnic and
challenged their right to vote.

So it's sack up and do something, or shut your pie hole.  Voting is
your right, as is your free speech and your right to challenge current
policy.  Lobby your representatives to produce a bill to change the
electoral college.  lobby them to not allow for federal or state
funding of elections.  you have a voice and it's not just labeled
qwerty in the upper left hand corner where you access all the
"internets" and mailing lists.

I don't particularly care if you dress up as a donkey and fellate yourself while simultanesously
smoking a joint rolled with a replica of the declaration of independence, all performed outside your
local polling place.

Your decision to not include yourself in the system means you have no right to criticize the system,
since you make no effort to affect change.

If you're not a part of the solution, you're a part of the problem.

when the dealer is dealing from the bottom of the deck, he usually

electoral process and how i think it should be corrected.

nah, thats called being suckers. and i think we have way more than

yeah good luck. in case youve never followed the money in 
elections youd know that people trying to change it in any 
meaningful way would never get the financial backing to actually 
be able to win the race. its a catch 22 with all the big money at 
the top of the problem. 

you can all delude yourselves into thinking that you make a 
difference, but youre all wrong. the only thing that makes a 
difference in this country is $$$, and none of you have that.

CNN.com still has it undecided.  73% reporting as of 12:47am.

I will be fairly irritated if Ohio is the reason Bush gets a 
second term.

Yeah, uh, the correspondant on CBS just said that Ohio probably won't be 
decided until 3 or 4 am.  foxnews.com however has Bush already winning that 
state and at 267 electoral votes while everyone else still has Ohio as 
undecided.  Wishful projecting?

Turn off the Fox News and NBC.

Here's the way Ohio is going to work...

Right now (1:20AM) The Monkey Fucker leads by 125,057 votes, and there  
are a lot of votes not counted yet (regular votes). Akron and Toledo  
are barely counted now.

The problem is that there are about 160k provisional ballots that have  
not been counted. If the difference between what's been counted and the  
provisional ballots is more than the lead Bush maintains, the  
provisional votes get counted starting in 11 days.

Fucking fuck NBC for wanting to be Fox, and fucking fuck Fox for  
fucking the elections in this country.

Keep your eyes peeled.

Anyone want to go in on a bus to go to the 10 million man march in DC?

god damn fucking bush lovers.  He didn't do anything fucking helpful to 
this country in the last 4 years, how the fuck is he going to help it 
the next 4?  God damnit

....ahh that felt good.  anyone who knows me, and read that, knows just 
how pissed off I am right now.  I still hope the provisionals come 
through, but it shouldn't fucking be this close.

I am seriously starting to look for places and jobs in canada, although 
I'll probably still stay here, till they decide to draft my ass, if 
that has any meaning.

on a lighter note, it was nice seeing all the anti-gay sentiment on
votes around the country.  "furthering opression of our citizens since
1776".  that should be the motto of our glorious nation... not that
"in god we trust" bull...

What's really twisted about that is if you read the entire context of 
the ohio ban, it erodes the legality of offering benefits to non-married 
heterosexual couples in addition to the homosexual ones.

The same people pushing it as a solution to the problem with "the 
sanctity of marriage" are really just pushing for more divorce and 
marriages for the sake of legal status, only further eroding what they 
stand for.

Speaking of off wording, the anti smoking ban here in Columbus went 
ahead with flying colors, but it was a double negative at the polls. RAWR.

i see now that you dont really value the democratic system of 
elections we have here in this country like you did yesterday. 
dont you trust the people to make the decision about who should be 
our leader? our fearless hero of a president gets another 4 years 
because he had more money. god bless him, god bless capitalism, 
and god bless democracy. 

america - the greatest country money can buy

Not too happy about the "God" thing and religion blending together with 
state / government. To each their own.. but don't get it involved in this.

I value the democratic system, it just didn't go the way I voted, thus 
I can vent my frustrations.

Did some talks around the office here.  one guy I don't know what he 
voted.  2 bush, 1 kerry and one that really wanted to vote for kerry 
but missed the registration deadline by 2 days.  the two bush 
supporters, one thought he did a great job at making our country more 
secure (by taking more of our rights) the other one I didn't really get 
a good reason why he voted for him.  Except that he liked the way he 
handled the war or something stupid like that.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} evil day

I'm so unbelievably pissed, too. I work in an office filled with gloating 
republican fucks. The thing that strikes me as odd, is that I've never tried 
to push my views on anyone. Ever. Yet, throughout the past cuple of weeks, 
I've been called names, like communist, nazi, etc. because I'm liberal. My 
only rebuttal (again, because I believe everyone should have the right to 
their own views) is that I'd like a president that would care about his 
people more than money, because money corrupts. I don't think that's ever 
going to happen in this country. Corrupted from east to west, the US is a 
country where the middle class is rapidly diasappearing, mostly blending in 
with lower class, and a few jumping into higher tax brackets. What's going 
to happen if the middle class disappears altogether? If Bush is reelected, 
who's going to care for the people like my parents? Answer: No one in the US 
government. Why? My parents don't make enough money to count as real people, 
according to families like the Bush's.  Which is wrong. And after the end 
result of the election, you'd better be damn sure that if Bush gets 
reelected, I'm going to punch every Republican I see in the face, and go 
ahead and play their little spiteful games and name-calling, and stoop down 
to their small-minded, selfish, evil, corrupted level, because it's not 
fucking fair that I have to suffer to make rich people's lives better. 
(whew)


Yep. Anyway, I suppose I'm moving to Canada, even though I'd rather not. 
It's cold, but every Canadian I've ever met has been so nice. Most people 
don't bother to lock their doors at night, healthcare is free, and they even 
have walk-in immigration offices.

The fat lady has yet to sing, even though fox news is reporting the 
president is about to make a victory speech.

It's 10:50AM and STILL no one has offered me sex if I take FNC off the air.

ps. that was a joke, I'd never do that. I enjoy being employed thank you 
very much.

The thing that sucks about expatriation is that you still have to pay 
your taxes here even though you pay them where you move to (if you ever 
want to come back to visit relatives, etc).

The best deal I've found is Holland, where after two years of working 
there you don't have to pay dutch taxes (but you still have to pay your 
US ones). You can get a visa to live there as long as you have 
guaranteed employment.

...and according to Ket, Ed has family there!

But just remember, there are 50 million other americans that feel the 
same way along with the rest of the world. This isn't over, even if 
monkey boy wins Ohio. This election was decided by <insert southern slur 
here> who don't realize they have more to gain from a Dem administration 
than from a Republican one.

Just stop, you guys.  There's nothing we can do about this election.  It
was stolen a long time before yesterday.  It's not our fault so stop
pointing the finger.  I say we take a day to drink and then plot the
revolution...or just keep drinking.

this should have been pretty obvious, yet still everyone was all 
high horse about voting. and even after this, they STILL try to 
tell me about it. ha. jokers, each and every last one of you who 
voted to continue the oppression of the poor through our current 
political system. good job.

define "worked"? so kerry won a useless majority in one state. how 
about all these idiots who voted to keep specter in office? i mean 
come on, this is just an example of the people voting having no 
fucking clue what theyre doing. aside from the flaws in the 
electoral system, the flaws in the electorate run deep as well. 
good luck getting these morons to not buy into the bullshit theyre 
being sold.

yep. 

some people dont seem to learn their lesson. they think "it will 
be different next time" but it never is. people line up to choose 
whose dick theyre going to have up their ass for the next 4 years. 
it makes me sick to watch a country be bamboozled like that.

Wrong.  You are now represented by Bush whether you voted or not.
More war, more fossil fuels, more religion based government policy, less liberty.

don't have to pay taxes here if I give up my american citizenship.  
Only if you have dual citizenship do you pay taxes both places.  Still 
sucks though.  I probably won't move there because of all the 
complications like finding a job, a place, paying taxes everywhere, 
visiting family down here.  ohh well, a person can dream, eh?

So, one last thing.

There's a possibility that Kerry could take the 20 EV's in Ohio. 
Probably, no, possible yes. Edwards comes on last night and says my vote 
counts, and Kerry concedes without the count being done. 

I don't get it.

dont recall the email youre mentioning, but thats not the point. 

what i do is try to, on a person to person basis, enlighten people 
to the futility of the current political and economic system and 
explain why i think violent revolution is the only way for the 
poor to ever get anything here. irritatingly enough, just about 
all the political parties and groups here have petty arguments 
over nonsense that stops them from being at all useful or relevant 
to the people. ive done plenty of activism in my time ace, at this 
point i have other responsibilities than to go out feeding 
homeless people on the street or protesting bullshit corporations 
who fuck people in this country (all during democrat rule for the 
most part!), but i wont support these fuckers now for anything.

im not sure how well versed you are in economics, but the shit

well theyre not going to feel that way for long enough for them to 
put pressure on politicians to change the way elections work in 
this country, if that would even work. real angry people pick up 
guns, like they did in the 1700s here.

my estimate of 500 million is just a guess as to what id need to 
compete with the dems and repubs in 08. to really win, i would 
probably need 6-700 mils. cant anyone see yet that these elections 
are bought, not voted on?

I will fucking beat all of those homeless winos with bats.

Maybe I should sit there on the corner of the street, ask people for change, 
make 250 dollars a day, and then whine about not getting free healthcare 
because my liver is rotting due to alchohol poisoning.

Homeless people can drink the sweat from my shiny clean balls. Get a fucking 
job or kill yourself.

Paul

What a horrible night to have a curse.

I had two doctors in Norway bring Bush up to me once and they very

I qualify as a skilled worker immigrant!  :)

Barely though.  I guess the no family in Canada, no arranged work, 
and not know French hurt me a bit.  But I still passed.  haha.

yah no doubt.  I work with a man who is like 50 years old.  He works as a
bus boy and is a immigrant from Mexico.  He owns a house (in dc thats no
small feat) and his daughter is a double grad from collage.  Thats what hard
work can give you.  Anybody who wants to bitch about not getting shit needs
to look at that mans life and realize that they could be better off if they
so choose.

nah, that would involve caring, and putting time and effort and 
thought into something. these characteristics are sorely lacking 
in the people on this list. all people can think about anymore 
is "me me me me me me me me". i love greedy idiots. especially 
ones that listen to some white ass bullshit rip off of house.

Work is there.  Some people choose to not work - it is a fact.  Does this
mean that some people are 2 insane to hold a job and now they live on the
street because we have no health care system to keep track of them, yes.  Is
this wrong? Hell yes of course it is.

Look Tom I'm not going to argue with you about "life is unfair" shit.  You
are right there is lots of messed up shit on this planet (and in this
country).  But instead of handing people shit I think we should try and
empower them to stand up take responsibility for their actions and accept
where they are.  People should feel that their life is theirs to create and
not be bogged down by new shoes, electronics and credit card debt.  But
these things are personal choice.

You can attack me personally and call me "Ace" "cocksucking motherfucker"
and whatever else you see fit but it has no affect on my life and how I live
it.  I made a personal choice to step away from consumerism and fast food
culture.  That was a choice I made.  I might not be rich but I have found
happiness in my life (that has nothing to do with god).  I think the choice
for personal growth in whatever we deem worthy for ourselves is something
lacking in our culture and I wish more people would understand that
happiness isn't about bling, its about personal accomplishments and a mind
that wants to explore.

Buying into stereotypes?

Me and my friend Andy were out getting Burger King one time. We actually saw 
a homeless guy outside asking for money for food. Instead of giving him 
money, we bought him a hamburger. He said he didn't want a hamburger, he 
wanted money for food. We told him "No burger, no nothing." He told us to 
fuck off.

Maybe he was saving up for a meal at the Ritz?

I have never met a bum who didn't deserve to be a bum. I am not saying they 
don't exist, but I'm not going to walk around the streets giving away 
Hamburgers hoping I found the right one.

I am a compassionate person. I'm not going to act hard and say I don't feel 
bad for people who were dealt a shitty life... but I really don't think I 
should.

9 times out of 10, a human being has an opportunity to make money. Its that 
simple. The fact that evil, hardship, and pain exists in the world isn't 
going to turn me into a sap who thinks that everything in life should be 
free and people are expected to give away their hard earnings 
indiscriminately.

Paul

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: {pb-cle} hate to pull a teeveestee but...

 http://tinyurl.com/3r3qf


 By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer

WASHINGTON - The Bush administration announced Wednesday that it will run
out of maneuvering room to manage the government's massive borrowing needs
in two weeks, putting more pressure on Congress to raise the debt ceiling
when it convenes for a special post-election session.

Treasury Department (news - web sites) officials announced that they will be
able to conduct a scheduled series of debt auctions next week to raise $51
billion. However, an auction of four-week Treasury bills due to be completed
on Nov. 18 will have to be postponed unless Congress acts before then to
raise the debt ceiling.

"Due to debt limit constraints, we currently do not have the capacity to
settle our four-week bill auction scheduled to settle on Nov. 18," Timothy
Bitsberger, acting assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets, said
in a statement.

Congress is scheduled to return for a lame-duck session beginning on Nov. 16
to deal with the debt ceiling, an omnibus spending plan for the rest of this
budget year and other matters.

The Republican-controlled Congress put off dealing with the debt ceiling
before adjourning in October, preferring not to force members to vote on the
politically sensitive issue of adding to the national debt before the
November elections.

The government hit the current debt ceiling of $7.384 trillion on Oct. 14,
forcing Treasury to begin a series of bookkeeping maneuvers to keep
financing the government's normal operations without breaching the debt
ceiling. But Treasury Secretary John Snow has warned that those special
measures would last only until mid-November.

The Treasury Department's actions have included reducing the amount of debt
in government trust funds to free up room for further borrowing from the
public. The nonpublic debt is then replaced in the trust funds once the debt
ceiling is increased along with any lost interest payments.

Republicans have proposed that the debt ceiling be raised by $690 billion to
$8.074 trillion, an amount that would get the government through next
September, when the 2005 budget year ends.

The need to raise the debt ceiling reflects the record budget deficits of
the past two years. The deficit for the 2004 budget year, which ended Sept.
30, was an all-time high of $413 billion, surpassing the old mark, in dollar
terms, of $377 billion in 2003.

Democrats blame the surging deficits on Bush's tax cuts, while the
administration contends the tax cuts provided critical economic stimulus to
help lift the economy out of the 2001 recession.

The administration says the president has a plan to cut the deficit in half
by 2009, but critics contend that the real problems will come in later years
as retiring baby boomers put unprecedented strains on Social Security
(news - web sites) and Medicare.

In its announcement Wednesday, Treasury said it will sell $51 billion in new
securities next week including $22 billion in three-year notes on Monday,
$15 billion in five-year notes on Tuesday and $14 billion in 10-year bonds
on Wednesday.

Oh, its personal now is it?

Thats perfectly fine.

Everything that I have, right here, right now, either I have worked for or 
my family has worked for. I don't owe anyone jack fucking shit, and I 
especially don't owe people like you any justification as to why I enjoy a 
particular style of music.

You're just such a heart warming person Tom. You have shown us all through 
and through that you just drive around smoking pot and giving things away 
because you're so nice. You care so much for your fellow man. You're not 
human. You aren't a biological machine created to ingest, digest, shit and 
then rot into the ground. You are above that. You are there to point out 
slavery, bad music, and not vote. We learn so much from people on this list!

Maybe I care about people by not perpetuating the idea that things should be 
given away and not worked for? Maybe I would rather take the pennies that I 
have earned, save them for my children like my parents did, so my child can 
have a peachy suburban life listening to whatever godamned music he or she 
feels like, and not have to worry about feeling obligated to give away money 
every time they are scrutinized by outspoken arrogant polesmokers?

My life is good, I am grateful for it. I am very happy with my right to tell 
you to fuck off when I don't want to share my dinner. I am very happy to 
share my leftovers when I am full. I am very happy that I can make that 
choice whenever I fucking feel like it.

Paul

What a horrible night to have a curse.

i'm not even looking at it that way. even if you don't give a shit
at all .. get yourself some information before making huge statements
like that - homeless people are all drunks. i guess single moms are all
whores too.

paul really though..do the soup kitchen thing. i've done it on several
holidays. takes the warm and fuzzy feeling right out from under mom and
dad's christmas tree.

cute story. andy sounds like a swell friend to grab a burger and shake
with. i don't know why the homeless guy didn't give you a high-five and
enjoy your gift. you should have told him to adjust his attitude.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

-----SHAKE N BREAK-----

Saturday, November 20th, 2004

A weekly event brought to you by S. SIMPSON from DynamixCrew.com
showcasing regional & local talent w/ resident DJ QUARTZ and guests.

Guest Dj for the Night:

DJ KARES -Boston, MA
"fresh off her birthday tour with Dj Baby Anne"

A fresh face in the dance scene, Dj Kares is already enamoring
partygoers across the country as her infectious positive attitude is
projected through her uplifting, crowd-energizing sets.  Her innate
ability to get a dance floor moving stems from her life-long passion for
music, and years spent as a cheerleader by day, then dancing all night
to the tunes of her favorite djs as she worked at several local
nightclubs. Spending most of her club-going career in Boston and New
York City, Kares cites her inspiration for jumping behind the decks as
the likes of dj greats Ferry Corsten, Armin van Buuren, and Paul Van
Dyk, and credits learning the tricks of the trade from several
dj/producer friends.  Dj Kares has showcased the refreshing style she
has created as predominantly a progressive trance dj (while maintaining
a strong breakbeat influence) at a variety of venues across the US. 
Cities she has played in include Miami, Jackson, Seattle, Portland, San
Diego, Boston, and Memphis.  Kares has also held a monthly residency in
Springfield, MA, and is called upon by magazines such as Glamour to drop
energetic beats for the models at their fashion shows.

Also with Resident Dj:
QUARTZ [DynamixCrew.com]
-droppin some ol skool breaks Baby Anne and Icey style for my girlie, 
Kares!

Promoter:
S. SIMPSON [DynamixCrew.Com]
-this successful promoter has brought to you many slammin parties that
has ripped through the Pgh scene the past 2 years.... He continues to
represent quality entertainment that music lovers desire.

Name another woman who can hold it down right beside Paul Johnson after 
DEMF 2002, tag with Trevor Lamont (Teamsters), share a residency with 
DJs Kit Chaps of VHS or Beta (Astralwerks) and rock the main stage next 
to Terry Mullan, Diego Ro-k and Dieselboy: Foursquare is supporting UFO 
Jeans and her CD, "What Happened?" this fall.

-Jon Doe ( Skratch Fienz / Cleveland) DNB, Hip Hop, Turntablism
Jon Doe is one of the most talented DJ's in Cleveland and yet unknown to 
those outside Cleveland. Jon Doe has been spinning for over 10 years now 
and continues to progress every day. Jon Doe works seven days a week, 
almost twelve hours a day, but he always finds time to get out and play, 
doing what he loves most, blowing ur mind. Talented in so many different 
areas of music Jon Doe is sure to impress!

-Robtronix and MC Barrenzemo (Koala Tea / P3 - DNB & MC) Cleveland
His funky flavor will captivate you within the first second of hearing 
him. Don't let him fool ya by the "i'm a nice boy" smile, like anyone of 
us we have a bad side and he puts that into his music. His thoughts are 
the drums and bass, his voice is the scratch.

-Shagge (Breaks) Cleveland
Shagge is one of the most amazing Breaks DJ's u will ever see...No more 
needs to be said!

-DJ Moose (Break Beat Militia / Breaks, Jump Up Jungle) Cleveland
Moose's unique style sprouts from his hip-hop influence. Blending 
hip-hop with breaks and jungle as well as keeping the crowd entertained 
has been moose's goal and motivation from the start. "All I want to do 
is make the whole crowd bounce, yall!", a sample of Snoop Doggy Dogg in 
a J-Smooth track, is what Moose uses as a slogan for every performance.

Info:

Legowelt
    Legowelt = the name under which Danny Wolfers releases most of his
music. What Music you might ask??? Well a hybrid form of slam jack The
Hague electronix combined with deep chicago trax,obscure & romantic
ghetto technofunk, EuroHorror Soundtracks and lots -a- more! You can't
quite pigeonhole it but it sure as hell slams the pit!
    Already a few years in the business Legowelt has released a dozen or
so projects on various formats, most of them on good ol' vinyl released
on homebase Bunker records, The Hague's legendary pioneering electronic
music label. Sometimes these tracks spin out of the obscurity like an
asteroid from a spacebelt and fly straight into the charts; such an
event happened with 'Disco Rout' which was voted track of the year 2002
by the acclaimed german Groove magazine.
    Legowelt began producing music when in the early 90ies the
adolescent autistic schoolboy came in sporadic contact with the sounds
of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably
his all-time favorite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley
Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and mr.Fingers. Later on this palette of
influences grew with early Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, various stuff
from The Irdial Discs label and virtually every type of freaked deep
music he could get his hands on.
    But nothing had quite the influence of when, somewhere in the early
90ies, he first heard a band called 'Unit Moebius' on the radio. A punky
palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi chicago trax and deep detroit jams made
with machines which were found next to the garbage can. Shocked in awe
he heard that this music came out of The Hague, Holland The very same
city he lived in! Put on the right track by this fact he stumbled into
the Bunker Records office and discoverd a world of contemporary autistic
freaked music lovers who looked beyond all the bland house and dance
music that ruled the media and clubs. Musical mentors such as IF and
Melvin White (aka pametex) lectured him with even more unknown sounds
such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco which
production secrets were closely studied. In 1998 Bunker released the
first vinyl of Legowelt : Pimpshifter, a 6 track mingled Italo Chicago
combi which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as 'Stumvogel'
and 'Total Pussy Control'.

Luke Eargoggle
    Deep, dark and slow, a black hole encroachment of your mind! Empty
cold pametex-style electro from the nordic territories, a sinister film
noir movie soundtrack, chillin'!

Orgue Electronique
    Orgue Electronique (Brian Chinetti) is the master of the staccato
minimal electro-nic sound with unexpected melodies and haunting tensions
in between beats. Orgue Electronique is not only known for the releases
he did on Bunker (the most searched cult-hit "The Eye That Never
Sleeps"), Stilleben (Arcadia full length album) and various
compilations, but also for his collaborations with Legowelt on Bunker
Records. Together they did several remixes, and later their
collaboration became better known as Macho Cat Garage, who did releases
on Viewlexx and Downlow and appeared on the DJ Hell mix CD on React.
Besides all this, Orgue Electronique has quite a reputation as a live
act, traveling all over the world: from the Hague to Detroit, from Tokyo
to New York, sharing the stage with many well known artists.

Catnip
    Catnip is the mysterious international team of producers bringing
you A1 classified raw electrodisco.

DJ TLR
    In the summer of love TLR started playing at punkparties in youth
homes that were later closed for asbestos threats. In 1996 he co-founded
Global Darkness and became involved in organising underground Jungle
parties in the totally freaked out and fucked up squat scene of the West
Coast of Holland area; filled with fundamentalists, attention junkies,
substance abusers, genetic experiments gone wrong and legions of crustie
tekno travellers like SP23 looking to escape the '94 Criminal Justice
Act and redefine noise pollution. In the late 90´s - when Jungle had
died a horrible death in Drum & Bass - he was swept away by the first
wave of The Hague electronics and the early works of I-F, Pametex and
Electronome when DJ Schmerlabor gave him some records at a Unit Moebius
gig. Their strange and exciting style was far removed from the mind
numbing lifetyle muzak that seemed to dominate the airwaves at the time
and refueled a love for electro in him that had been dormant since the
mid 80's. When introduced to the hidden treasures in the Clone
recordshop (that was then housed in a small and dark backroom of
Rotterdam´s Urban Unit) matters really got out of hand. TLR started
cultivating his newfound passion around ´98 when the bankrupt Bunker
label rose from its own ashes like a phoenix. Soon after the original
Global Darkness crew went separate ways. He made the Bunker Records
website and started Global Darkness, which silently grew into one of the
biggest and most active electro/disco communities on the Internet. In
2000 him and fellow dirty brown loser DJ Schmerzlabor (of Unit Moebius
fame) concocted the Bunker Records Dirty Brown World Tour and invited
Legowelt & Orgue Electronique (at that time one of the few Bunker live
acts) along to spread the dirty brown gospel. The Bunker Team was born
and he slowly rediscovered the early Freewave pirate radio Italo/disco
sounds of his childhood through the mixes of I-F and sunday afternoon
tea sessions in the luxurious mansions of Legowelt and Orgue
Electronique. And then the sky went open (insert trumpets here). It
didn't take long before the boys myth of grandeur became a reality, and
they've been touring ever since. The end of 2001 saw the birth of the
Crème Organization. What started out as a little playground for Mr
Clavio soon grew to more serious proportions with consecutive releases
of Lolita Strap, Bangkok Imoact and It & My Computer. Crème Organization
has been releasing on a rigorous schedule and quickly gained a cult
following. The following years shit got a little crazy for Crème and the
Bunker Team with several coast to coast US and Canadian tours, a bunch
Japanese tours and nonstop travel around Europe. In 2005 DJ TLR will
hold residencies Madrid but also in Tokyo and Osaka, introducing
European electro talent in Japan.

I agree whole-heartedly...

What bothers me are the people who are getting things for free that don't 
deserve it, and when they do not receive what they feel is owed to them they 
make other peoples' lives miserable instead of actually doing something 
proactive.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

My point still stands. The poor in this country would be considered rich
in most of the world.

As opposed to trusting who? Lazy bastards who whine about 'the system'
because it doesn't give them everything on a silver platter?

the way poor live in this country is disgraceful considering how most
people have it in *this* country. no one should want for food while the
rest of the country is overweight.  if you've met up with one asshole
homeless person who wasn't thankful when offered food, i've met up with
1,000 "working" people who make way more money than they should, and do
nothing to help the problem.

haha..you totally don't get it at all. here's another thing you can try -
become a big brother thru the 'big brother big sister' program. check out
all the perks available to kids born into poor families in this country.
watch parking your hard earned car in the projects though. you might want
to take the bus in.

Some of the folks here have a very suburban ivory tower view of
poverty.  I keep waiting for paul fleetwood to say "let them eat

You want to feel sick about how we waste food, go to a cici's pizza 
place.  It's all you can eat pizza, which in itself is bad since you 
usually eat more than you really need and that extra food could go to 
someone that needs it more.  But the part that shocked me was if 
there's like 3 slices left, and they have a new pizza out, they just 
take that one out and put it below the bar and I assume throw it away.  
And they're constantly doing that.  On one hand it's nice that they 
always keep fresh pizza there, but the fact that they are throwing out 
perfectly good pizza just amazed me.  And I'm usually not one to be 
amazed by wasted food, like people leaving half the food on their plate 
at restaurants and stuff don't really bother me.  But when you think 
about all the pizza they are just tossing (again, can't confirm that, 
but don't know what else they would do with it when they toss it below 
the bar like they do), it really makes me sick.  I know their was a guy 
that actually did get the leftovers from all you can eat buffets and 
took them to homeless shelters.  I'm half tempted to actually go up to 
the manager and ask that.  Although 1) I'll admit I'm lazy, 2) don't 
know of any local homeless shelters or food banks, 3) don't have much 
room in my car to transport it.

Here's the problem with that - which leads to an entirely different 
problem with today's society... Most food establishments will not allow 
employees to take food home, or to take it to give to those in need, 
because if someone got sick - they could turn around and sue the 
establishment.

So instead, we waste.

Yeah, I thought about that.  that's why I, who is not part of the 
company, could take it in unmarked containers.  Go to the place and 
drop it off and only identify myself as John Doe.  Or 'The Yellow Dart' 
or something.  So if someone does get sick, they can't do anything to 
me, or to the food place.

find the contradiction there. i spent more hours on this shit when

politically active for 10 years, ive had my photos taken by secret 
service in front of the white house, ive had police threaten to 
arrest me for feeding homeless people, my friends and i were 
pretty much solely responsible for keeping the pittsburgh chapter 
of food not bombs alive in pittsburgh in the late 90s when it was 
no longer fashionable to be into politics. and all of this 
happened before i even turned 18 and could vote. my history can 
pretty much only be called into question if you want to be all 
george bush about it. i guess living in those suburbs has finally 
won you over, eh?

food not bombs (if it even exists in your city) is great because 
thats how it works. the whole principle of the thing is to get 
free "left over" food from restaurants donated to you to then cook 
and serve, as not to be wasteful. even a small group of people can 
take a few hours and get shit accomplished in this manner.

its funny to hear you say that. i mean the way unemployment is 
going, theres going to be less and less work for unskilled (aka un 
schooled aka poor) people, and that work is going to pay less and 
less. you can already work a full time 40 hour a week job and 
still be in poverty.

do you understand the idea of capitalism? honestly, i dont think 
you do. if you take those people that are currently unemployed and 
killed every single one of them, within a few months as the market 
corrected itself, you would have a whole new set of unemployed 
people, probably at least equivalent to the number you just 
killed. this is not "accepting where you are", this is a 
fundamental flaw in the economic system that benefits few and 
screws many. and no one who benefits wants to pay their part to 
keep people from being in poverty because they dont have to worry 
about it. 

>People should feel that their life is theirs to create and

are they? again, this is a symptom of capitalism, not anything

good for you, ace. at least in this post you tried to make 
something resembling a coherent argument, though you come at it 
with a definite lack of knowledge about the economic realities of 
our country.

i cant agree with anything you said here more. but this isnt 
reality for most people. i hate to always bring these kinds of 
things up, but as a white male in this country you automatically 
have a better chance of finding some level of success than females 
or people of color. thats just the way things work.

thats lovely. you know who says things like this? republicans. i

compassionately cut social programs to motivate these lazy poor 
people.

youre such a shortsighted nitwit. maybe the motherfuckers YOU know 
have a chance to make money. anecdotal evidence is nothing. shit, 
thats like saying "hey, i dont see any homeless people around here 
so there must be no homeless people anywhere" when youre living in 
the suburbs. 

good luck living your compassionate life.

its because youre a priveledged ignorant white male, just like all 
the other fucking useless motherfuckers in this country. sooo, 
lets look at these things your family or you worked for. do you 
remember the stock market collapse? no, of course not. nor do you 
remember the rampant economic problems that occured that required 
all the programs that have been institued since then. nor do you 
give any credit to the people who make economic policy that allows 
people to get paid what their time is worth. did your family start 
labour unions? did they increase the minimum wage to help people 
working crap jobs get by? did they repeal those child labour laws 
that are preventing you from having been working in a coal mine 
since you were a little boy? huh, i dont think so you ingrateful 
little fucking self righteous prick. i hope you and your mother 
and father are victims of another economic collapse and youre all 
living in the street being self righteous about how much you 
worked for.

i would like to kill you, so your life wouldnt be so good anymore. 
then maybe you could find some compassion for someone else.

sounds to me like youre a fucking moron. you want to live in 
suburbia and choose to be an idiot, but then you also want to

whatever you say ace. its funny that these people on here are 
suddenly politically aware and think they know whats going on, 
when they dont. this shit isnt a trend for me, ive been living the 
life for as long as ive had the perspective to see whats going on 
in the world. you can call me all the names you want.

Subject: {pb-cle} Analog Pussy interview with Goahead's Ari D

TripOutNY meets Analog Pussy

By Ari (arid@djcentral.com)
www.goaheadproductions.com
www.brainmachines.com

November 2004

Jiga and Jinno of Analog Pussy have taught us to always expect the
unexpected when it comes to their take on psytrance. From mega-raves to
trance stomps around the world, for over a decade, they continue to roll
out the freshest sonic wares and just rock it! They take on trance never
letting go of the raw sounds of analog synths and punk rock guitars, both
of which define their musical roots. And their distinct approach does not
just end there. Ever since the early 90’s, they’ve toured all the time and
harnessed the growing reach of the internet, both to build worldwide
recognition for Analog Pussy that goes far beyond the usual psytrance
fare. Now owners of their label AP Records while living in the countryside
in Germany, Jiga and Jinno find themselves enjoying total creative
freedom. Their latest release is a set of remixes of their popular track
“Future” by the likes of Son Kite, SBK and Indica. Here are some thoughts
Jiga and Jinno have just shared with us.

So several months after the release of Trance N Roll album, how has it
been received in Europe and elsewhere in the world?

Jiga: It was received well especially in Europe. We weren’t sure how will a

Rocky-Punky album go down in a scene where generic boom boom trax are the
trend makers.

Then when we played ”Future” and “Psycho Punko” live on stage for the
first time. People were singing the lyrics with us, and we knew we changed
something in the face of the Psy Music.

This album has a new direction compared to your previous work. Did your
fans appreciate it as much as you had hoped? Have they come to expect that
AP will stay fresh and on the cutting edge with each new release?

Jinno: People who appreciate our work know they can expect the unexpected
from us.

After releasing our first album “Psycho Bitch from Hell” we were labeled
as a full-on goa band. Then we came out with “Underground” - groovy
minimal Trance album and some people were disappointed as they expected us
to sound the same.

Later on people just realized we do what we do, what we want, when we want.

We don’t care for the fashionable sound in the market. Having a record
label of our own helped to solve this issue completely. We owe no
explanation to anyone and we have a total freedom to create in different
fields of inspiration.

“Trance N Roll” sounds like the simplest and most fitting title for this
album, but I bet it wasn’t easy to settle on this name…

Jiga: Actually it was. Since the concept was very clear – Trance and Rock
motives, so we were standing in the kitchen thinking – roll and trance,
rock and psy, and then together we shouted – “Trance N Roll”!

Analog Pussy is unconventional in so many ways... in music, in personality
and in approach. Do you find that all this helps you reach out to people
beyond the traditional trance communities around the globe?


Jinno: we do reach people and factors beyond the Psy-Trance scene, and I
believe it has a strong connection to being independent artists and label
owners. We can release a track with vocals on it, without being afraid to
be rejected, and thus be widely exposed in other communities as well. We
can decide to release computer games based on our music or a DVD with our
videos; we just keep our minds open, learn from the industry and implement
our knowledge in the business while maintaining our integrity as artists.

You understood very early that you were pretty much powerless against
people copying your music through bootlegs and the internet. You’ve found
a formula to deal with this. How has your “If you can’t beat them, join
them” attitude affected the business end of your work, specifically
promotion and finances?

Jiga: when it was time to write the traditional copyrights warning on the
CD I thought; why, that is so missing the point. If one downloads this
music over the internet, they will never see the warning anyway. And even
if they did, they wouldn’t care. A more elegant approach was to grant
permission to copy if you’re broke and encourage you to promote our band
in return. It’s too soon to tell how it has affected the business side,
but my overall feeling is that it was a smart move.

Your live performances are in sharp contrast to what most have come to
expect at a usual psytrance party. Does it work like, the more personal
energy you give, the more feedback you get?

Jiga: Normally yes. The more heart and soul I put in the more excited the
audience is.

Sometimes it doesn’t happen. I’ve had shows where I gave it all and people
didn’t get it, or didn’t want to. In these cases I learn to appreciate
even more the magical shows where it does work.

Jinno: I can’t formulate what drives what. For me it just happens and I
prefer not to analyze it or think about it. One of the things we do that
is quite unusual is rehearsing before our shows. Just like any other rock
band. So that when we come to play, we don’t have to constantly worry
about technical details. We can be reassured that everything is working
perfectly and we can concentrate on how we feel. I believe that’s the main
magic of our live show.

That moment during a live performance, when you’re at the climax of a
massive build-up and a great crowd is really feeling it… then drop! Is the
rush better than sex or what?

Jinno: not better than sex… but definitely a rush. Doesn’t matter if I
feel sick before or tired, during and after a show we feel on the top of
the world physically and mentally.

Jiga: it’s different in my case – the chemicals in my blood go nuts in my
system.

It comes about half an hour after the show ended. I call it “the big
down”, the greater the adrenaline in the show, the better the party is,
the more I sink into an empty nothingness later on. It takes about 18
hours to get my natural chemicals back to normal.

:

Every performer has that one silly moment on stage they’ll always
remember. Yours?

Jiga: sliding on the floor from a wet stage, falling on my ass with a
synth in my hands,

But keep on playing it laughing.


Jinno: seeing Jiga sliding on the floor.


What else are you two into besides the music? It’s hard to imagine
anything can bring you as much joy…


Jiga: I like anything that has to do with network, I would probably be a
network consultant if I wasn’t a musician. I also like eating food with my
hands.


Jinno: nothing.


What have you heard about our US trance community and party scene?


Jiga: heard that it’s very small, narrow minded and concentrates mainly in
NY. Can’t say for sure before we play there ourselves.



Jinno: we played a few time in the US in non Psy-Trance events. Mainly in
raves across the US. That was nice because it was very different than what
we are used to.

The way people dance and dress and react was new to us and it was
interesting to experience that. It also gave us a chance to play for
people who never heard of us or Psy-Trance before.


Where is your tour schedule taking you over the coming months?

Jiga: Switzerland, Tokyo, Germany, Chile.

Your upcoming release is a remixes CD to “Future”, taken from your last
album “Trance N Roll”; what kind of experience is it for you to hear your
work combined with other people's perspectives?


Jinno: besides the joy this project brought to us, it was a learning
experience.

It’s one thing to have your track remixed by another person and it’s
another thing to have one track remixed by 10 different artists. Each
remix is unique with a different interpretation and touch. It showed us
once again that music isn’t about a clean production and expensive studio
gear. It’s about feeling, it’s about soul.

Paul Oakenfold's Pal Trashes Tony Blair

Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas author Hunter S Thompson, who guest starred on 
Paul
Oakenfold's album Bunkka last year, ridiculed Oakey's new next-door 
neighbour
Tony Blair this week, attacking him over his close personal relationship 
with
President Bush.

"We are losing this stupid fraudulent war in Iraq and every nation in the 
world
despises us," the American underground icon complained, "except for a 
handful of
corrupt Brits, like that simpering little whore Tony Blair." (The 
Independent)

His comments could pose problems when the British prime minister moves into 
his
Paddington mansion next to Oakey's London pad, particularly since the 
superstar
DJ is a massive fan of Thompson's literature and views.

"You can pick up one of his books and still relate to it today," he told
Australian magazine 3D World last year.

"It's dangerous- I like that, it appeals to me and it appeals to youth; the
danger is what he says because it's so truthful," he added.

Chatting to Skrufff soon after (to Skrufff's then man in China Seb Bayne) 
Oakey
revealed he's also kept in close touch with the Colorado based renowned gun
fanatic, since collaborating on Bunkka.

'I speak to him every time I am in his part of the world", Oakey revealed.

http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/story.jsp?story=577323 ('The 
first
time I noticed George W Bush," Hunter Thompson tells me, "was when he passed 
out

so, what the article is saying is...nothing about oakenfold, except that blair is moving in next

this hardly qualifies for the "truth in subject line" award, i'd say...

Paul Oakenfold's Pal Trashes Tony Blair

Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas author Hunter S Thompson, who guest starred on
Paul
Oakenfold's album Bunkka last year, ridiculed Oakey's new next-door
neighbour
Tony Blair this week, attacking him over his close personal relationship
with
President Bush.

"We are losing this stupid fraudulent war in Iraq and every nation in the
world
despises us," the American underground icon complained, "except for a
handful of
corrupt Brits, like that simpering little whore Tony Blair." (The
Independent)

His comments could pose problems when the British prime minister moves into
his
Paddington mansion next to Oakey's London pad, particularly since the
superstar
DJ is a massive fan of Thompson's literature and views.

"You can pick up one of his books and still relate to it today," he told
Australian magazine 3D World last year.

"It's dangerous- I like that, it appeals to me and it appeals to youth; the
danger is what he says because it's so truthful," he added.

Chatting to Skrufff soon after (to Skrufff's then man in China Seb Bayne)
Oakey
revealed he's also kept in close touch with the Colorado based renowned gun
fanatic, since collaborating on Bunkka.

'I speak to him every time I am in his part of the world", Oakey revealed.

http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/story.jsp?story=577323 ('The
first
time I noticed George W Bush," Hunter Thompson tells me, "was when he passed
out
in my bathtub at the Hyatt Regency in Houston. He was with a guy who had
come to
sell . . ." . . .Look, I'm not going to put this next sentence on the
record.
Let's just say that 'a friend of mine' was buying cocaine . . .')

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} music industry cover-up

The law's stance in the music industry has made me totally ill since I 
realized it's control in it about 10 years ago. The national socialist 
people of the RIAA/BMI/ASCAP ae disgusting. The fact that you submit 
demos to a lawyer and not an A&R person (solicited material, ref: 
airheads) should point out what's wrong with it right there.

The problem that those groups see with internet audio distribution isn't 
that it's stealing, it's that it totally puts them out of the loop, 
making it harder for them to make a product to sell you (and I'm not 
talking CD's).

Lipsyncing is another ugly byproduct of lawyers, even if the artist is 
talented (in most cases that's a big not). Rawr.

Grumpy cuz I'm on call, yet again, again,

I said:
<< So has child pornography, but that doesn't make it any more acceptable. >>

And our resident "fuckin' weirdo" said:
<<i am for keeping porn 18 and older, but haven't you ever considered, some kids just start having
sex early and just don't stop.>>

Uhm....I wasn't making a value judgement. It was just  a statement that kiddie pron isn't socially
acceptable in mainstream America. That's a fact that isn't really open for debate.

<<the virgin mary was 15 when she had baby jesus.>>

Right, but she didn't have sex beforehand.

And that was 2000 years ago.

And that has nothnig WHATSOEVER to do with porn.

In America.

Today.

People need to learn how to read.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} BSP....well not really

i'm not usually one for psytrance, but this was pretty good. it's a real "journey" type track....a
little break beat, a lot of 4/4, lots of arpeggiated goodness... i also dig the solo keyboard thing
you do during the last 5 or so minutes of the track. even at 16 minutes, it doesn't feel like it's
dragging on too long...

i give it 7 out of 10 for execution, good mixing.

my constructive criticisms:
* the virus-sounding static-y noise thing just hovering in the track got a little annoying after a
while. it needs mixed down a little lower at about 7:00 when the 4/4 starts to come in. on a loud
system, this would just be murder...
* the bass drum didn't really "thump". i dunno what it needs, but it needs more of it. (this may
also be a result of a 128k MP3 on a crappy sound card....so don't take my word as authority....)
* the bassline durring the 4/4 needs to be brought more to the foreground...if that makes sense...
* the breakbeat drum track sounds like it was one of the stock samples in Reason 1.0...even if you
didn't do the track in Reason, I'd mess with that particular sample a bit to make it a little less
recognizable (to lots of us who use Reason, anyway).


more cowbell,

I just thought you guys might dig this track.  No big deal really.  Check it out.  Hopefully you dig
it as much as I dug writing it.

Consolation, I want so much, Want to feel your touch, Tonight...
Take me in your arms, Forgetting all you couldn't do today...

Black Celebration ; I'll drink to that ; Black Celebration ; Tonight....=B2

When the rear fully retracts, two CDJ-1000s and a DJM-600 mixer in a 
"coffin" motorizes up, ready to play music for the crowd. Two AVD-W8000 
8-inch monitors reside next to the CDJ-1000s and monitor in the rear window 
provide video entertainment
Mounted on the doors are Pioneer’s REV series component speakers. The rear 
doors motorizes open to reveal four sets of the TS-C160R REV speakers 
installed in specially shaped enclosures.
A total of four Pioneer TS-W12PRS 12-inch subwoofers provide heart pounding 
bass. REV style grills match the REV speakers on the doors.

Subject: {pb-cle} Need CDJ800 or CDJ1000 for the BBT Weds

Hey, if anyone has a CDJ 800 or CDJ 1000 that we can borrow for the
BBT tomorrow night, please let me know ASAP.  There is $20 for you and
some free beers and much gratitude of course.

Adam Oliveri's friend agreed to lend us one as of friday, but I can't
seem to get in touch with Adam via phone or email.  So I am scrambling
to find a backup, or in the case that Adam's friend backs out, I am
scrambling to just get one in general.  If anyone is close personal
friends with Adam and can get access to him, please do me a favor and
ask him to get in touch with me?

Silver from the Accidental Heroes, Sonic + Silver, etc is coming and
he says that's the only one he can use. I'm just trying to find him
one, and now it is approaching last minute --

Please get at me, thanks,

Subject: {pb-cle} To Scott and everybody


			
			So obviously this is DJScythian@aol.com.  Same dude.  New e-mail address.  Scott, my good brother man, I never claimed to have a classy operation over here.  I have a computer (with over 30 or so megabytes of porn on it, along with reason 2.5 and cakewalk sonar 3 (cakewalk, I never use), a desk (which I've spilt many a beer on and rolled many a joint),a Yamaha RS7000 and a korg MS2000b.  I wish it was a classy operation.  Really all I have is the equipment, and about 7 yrs of seclusion practicing.  And the fact that I can do it live and pull it off so that it's halfway interesting to watch.  (Collabarations Prods.) I'm not saying all of this unfriendly like.  I appreciate the criticism.  Helps me grow.  helps me learn new ways to not be retarded.  Thank you scott.  You've shed light on something I was never even thinking about.  In my defense though, I threw that page together in about 15 minutes.  The song on the other hand, talkin about 20-24 hrs of work getting the bases laid.  Gettin them to sound just right.  Basically writing and constructin a pallete of about 9 or so loops, which then, on a sunday afternoon, i sat down, blazed one up, and proceeded to toss about those 9 or so loops, jam on some keys over top of those loops, all sorts of crazy button pushing and knob turning, i control reason with the RS7000 and MS2000, got real comfortable with the rack I built.  Figured out the ins and outs of it.  Then I pressed record ona simple wavestudio program and jammed the song out for bout 17 mins.  That's how the scythian makes a song.  I love music.  I love making music.  I will never stop.  I know, "cut it with the BSP", but (cue the national anthem).......isn't BSP what the scene was founded on.  "Hey my shit rocks, and I'm gonna make up this real flashy cool flyer to let ya know".  And you were like "Wow that looks really cool".  Than you would listen to it, and it'd be like, "Wow that sounds really cool".  This was all possible because of BSP.  Let's have a round of applause for BSP shall we?

maybe youre doing something wrong? with 7 years of practice and 
most of your shit on the computer, you should be banging it out. 
no offense, but i doubt its taken certain major label bands 24 
hours worth of studio time to "get the bases laid" on some serious 
classics. and for dance music, shit, larry heard wrote "can u feel 
it", "waching machine", and "beyond the clouds" 
(http://www.discogs.com/release/1948) all in the same afternoon.

			"maybe youre doing something wrong? with 7 years of practice and 
most of your shit on the computer, you should be banging it out. 
no offense, but i doubt its taken certain major label bands 24 
hours worth of studio time to "get the bases laid" on some serious 
classics. and for dance music, shit, larry heard wrote "can u feel 
it", "waching machine", and "beyond the clouds" 
(http://www.discogs.com/release/1948) all in the same afternoon. 

tommmmmmmm" 


Interesting point.  However, it just so happens that some of my major musical influences take there time in the studio and produce music with outstanding substance, and it sometimes takes them years to get it done.  (Nine Inch Nails, Tool, Shpongle, Future Sound Of London, Radiohead, blah blah blah)  It's hard to comment on this without offending poeple, but house music for instance.  I enjoy listening to it, but I could never compose house music.  Not on purpose anyway.  If something I wrote sounded like house, it probably wouldn't be intentional.  The point is, my heart wouldn't be into it.  I think the fact that a dude can bang out 3 tracks in a day, might say a little something for the said style.  It doesn't say that that style is less than any other, but maybe that it takes a little less time to produce.  I'm going for kind of an epic style here, and it takes some time to gather inspiration to pull it off just right.  When I say 24 hours to get the bases laid, I mean, 24 hours of dicking around after a long day of work, but not really getting anything accomplished.  Than going out on saturday nights and partying, coming home on sunday feeling completely inspired, reworking the grooves a bit, and then jam the son of a bitch out.  i don't know man, interesting debate here.  I love it.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  So far all but one person
thinks this is a good idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Comprising prolific emcees Aceyalone, Abstract Rude and Mikah 9, the

Hip-hop genre benders Zion I and rapper/skateboarder/graffiti artist

-----SHAKE N BREAK-----

Saturday, November 20th, 2004

A weekly event brought to you by S. SIMPSON from DynamixCrew.com
showcasing regional & local talent w/ resident DJ QUARTZ and guests.

Guest Dj for the Night:

DJ KARES -Boston, MA
"fresh off her birthday tour with Dj Baby Anne"

A fresh face in the dance scene, Dj Kares is already enamoring
partygoers across the country as her infectious positive attitude is
projected through her uplifting, crowd-energizing sets.  Her innate
ability to get a dance floor moving stems from her life-long passion for
music, and years spent as a cheerleader by day, then dancing all night
to the tunes of her favorite djs as she worked at several local
nightclubs. Spending most of her club-going career in Boston and New
York City, Kares cites her inspiration for jumping behind the decks as
the likes of dj greats Ferry Corsten, Armin van Buuren, and Paul Van
Dyk, and credits learning the tricks of the trade from several
dj/producer friends.  Dj Kares has showcased the refreshing style she
has created as predominantly a progressive trance dj (while maintaining
a strong breakbeat influence) at a variety of venues across the US. 
Cities she has played in include Miami, Jackson, Seattle, Portland, San
Diego, Boston, and Memphis.  Kares has also held a monthly residency in
Springfield, MA, and is called upon by magazines such as Glamour to drop
energetic beats for the models at their fashion shows.

Also with Resident Dj:
QUARTZ [DynamixCrew.com]
-droppin some ol skool breaks Baby Anne and Icey style for my girlie, 
Kares!

Promoter:
S. SIMPSON [DynamixCrew.Com]
-this successful promoter has brought to you many slammin parties that
has ripped through the Pgh scene the past 2 years.... He continues to
represent quality entertainment that music lovers desire.

*Zythos/Memphis Lounge is located
@2108 East Carson Street, Pittsburgh (South Side)*

Sun Nov 21                      TORTURED SOUL                     Cleveland

11/21 - Tortured Soul / Aphrodesiatics / MisterBradleyP - 9pm $8 adv / $10 dos  - 11/21 - 
Tortured Soul / Aphrodesiatics / MisterBradleyP - 9pm $8 adv / $10 dos  Tortured Soul is 
music that will move you. It's a new concept in the world of house music: it's live. The 
instrumentation is simple and organic - drums, electric bass, vintage keys, and soulful 
vocals. Tortured Soul filters club sounds like Afro Beat and Samba through a lens of jazzy 
House and American Soul to reflect intense grooves evocative of Jamiroquai, Stevie Wonder, 
The New Deal, and Fela Kuti. May 2004 marks the release of Tortured Soul's debut full-length 
album, "Introducing Tortured Soul" on Purpose Records. It showcases their live tracks, as 
well as studio productions and re-mixes, and coincides with an aggressive touring schedule 
covering the US, Canada, Japan and Europe. Spring and Summer of 2004 also sees Tortured Soul 
spotlighted with several tracks on Moonshine's upcoming Central Park Compilation and the 
upbeat Central Park single release of "Fall In Love," newly remixed by Eric Kupper. 
Recently, Tortured Soul was featured on DJ Spinna's album, 'Here to There' with a funky 
remake of his classic track, "Rock." Tortured Soul was conceived in May 2001 by drummer, 
singer, and songwriter Christian Urich - known in the world of house and R&B as founder and 
leader of the band Cooly's Hot Box. The single "We Don't Have To Be Alone" introduced 
Cooly's Hot Box to the house music world, and their acid jazz classic "Don't Throw My Love 
Around" on Polygram's London/Payday Records is featured on the first Giant Step compilation 
and as the hook for Armond Van Heldon's "Funk Phenomenon." Urich has worked with such 
producers as Reggie Lucas (Madonna, Stephanie Mills), DJ Spinna, and Roger Sanchez (on his 
album First Contact.) The first Tortured Soul single for Central Park Recordings was the 
now-classic house track "I Might Do Something Wrong" re-mixed by Osunlade. The track was an 
immediate success, playing weekly at New York's legendary party Body & Soul and altering the 
sound of Central Park Recordings. Inspired by Tortured Soul the label turned in a new 
direction, and focused on the fusion of soul with deep house music.

**IN THIER FIRST EVER PREFORMANCE TOGETHER***
-XAVIER, KOS, AND MC FLIPSIDE (House, Hard House, Live PA)
Xavier and Kos are artists that are one of a kind. When the table is set 
and the crowd is in full force, they drop the high-energy funk that 
crushes dances floors and makes the walls shake. Now with the addition 
of MC Flipsides the party is sure to be hyped!

-Kaos - (Philly - Human Imprint, Habit, Violence, Atlas, Circle, 
Breakline Crew) DnB

DJ Shortee form Stanton’s first female scratch duo "Twice as Nice.” 
Anna combines breakbeat and electro with DMC style trickery & is known 
for rocking the crowd!.

-DJ Booth (Louisville, KY – Urban Loops, UFO Jeans, 4-Score) House
Fists in the air: Chaos reigns. For 8 years DJ Booth has dominated the 
midwest, headlining with international acts and struggling for what he 
now holds so dear – an extensive play history of dates nationally and 
internationally, an insurmountable fan base, multiple original 
compositions released nationwide, six mixed CD's, an appointment as a 
promotional rep by the UFO clothing company, and a rockin' remix of "Up 
to You" by Robbie Hardkiss of the famous Hardkiss brothers.

-Rob Riddum (Cleveland – J&N Media) Dnb/Hip-Hop turntablist
One of the key figures of the Element Squad returns to Cleveland. While 
in LA, Rob was working out of the old Beastie Boys’ studio “Grand 
Royale” where his main project was www.bradleyhiphop.com. Rob recently 
took home 3rd place at the Salt Lake City DMC. Come see this old skool 
turntablist wreck the decks.

-Kryteria (Curtis R & Patrick Felony – Miami – Breakline Crew) DnB
Playing prestigious events like Ultra Music Festival, Global Gathering, 
and Magical Maydaze has many djs and producers stateside and worldwide 
supporting this dynamic duo by playing their tunes and crowds all over 
are eating them up! With the likes of Karl K and Kaos behind these 
original bad boys none can contest!

Skyehigh, Breakline Crew, La Selva) DnB/Dancehall/Turntablism

areas of music Jon Doe is sure to impress!

-Robtronix and MC Barrenzemo (Koala Tea / P3 - DNB & MC) Cleveland
His funky flavor will captivate you within the first second of hearing 
him. Don't let him fool ya by the "i'm a nice boy" smile, like anyone of

Shagge is one of the most amazing Breaks DJ's u will ever see...No more 
needs to be said!

-DJ Moose (Break Beat Militia / Breaks, Jump Up Jungle) Cleveland
Moose's unique style sprouts from his hip-hop influence. Blending 
hip-hop with breaks and jungle as well as keeping the crowd entertained 
has been moose's goal and motivation from the start. "All I want to do 
is make the whole crowd bounce, yall!", a sample of Snoop Doggy Dogg in

Info:

Legowelt
    Legowelt = the name under which Danny Wolfers releases most of his
music. What Music you might ask??? Well a hybrid form of slam jack The
Hague electronix combined with deep chicago trax,obscure & romantic
ghetto technofunk, EuroHorror Soundtracks and lots -a- more! You can't
quite pigeonhole it but it sure as hell slams the pit!
    Already a few years in the business Legowelt has released a dozen or
so projects on various formats, most of them on good ol' vinyl released
on homebase Bunker records, The Hague's legendary pioneering electronic
music label. Sometimes these tracks spin out of the obscurity like an
asteroid from a spacebelt and fly straight into the charts; such an
event happened with 'Disco Rout' which was voted track of the year 2002
by the acclaimed german Groove magazine.
    Legowelt began producing music when in the early 90ies the
adolescent autistic schoolboy came in sporadic contact with the sounds
of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably
his all-time favorite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley
Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and mr.Fingers. Later on this palette of
influences grew with early Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, various stuff
from The Irdial Discs label and virtually every type of freaked deep
music he could get his hands on.
    But nothing had quite the influence of when, somewhere in the early
90ies, he first heard a band called 'Unit Moebius' on the radio. A punky
palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi chicago trax and deep detroit jams made
with machines which were found next to the garbage can. Shocked in awe
he heard that this music came out of The Hague, Holland The very same
city he lived in! Put on the right track by this fact he stumbled into
the Bunker Records office and discoverd a world of contemporary autistic
freaked music lovers who looked beyond all the bland house and dance
music that ruled the media and clubs. Musical mentors such as IF and
Melvin White (aka pametex) lectured him with even more unknown sounds
such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco which
production secrets were closely studied. In 1998 Bunker released the
first vinyl of Legowelt : Pimpshifter, a 6 track mingled Italo Chicago
combi which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as 'Stumvogel'
and 'Total Pussy Control'.

Luke Eargoggle
    Deep, dark and slow, a black hole encroachment of your mind! Empty
cold pametex-style electro from the nordic territories, a sinister film
noir movie soundtrack, chillin'!

Orgue Electronique
    Orgue Electronique (Brian Chinetti) is the master of the staccato
minimal electro-nic sound with unexpected melodies and haunting tensions
in between beats. Orgue Electronique is not only known for the releases
he did on Bunker (the most searched cult-hit "The Eye That Never
Sleeps"), Stilleben (Arcadia full length album) and various
compilations, but also for his collaborations with Legowelt on Bunker
Records. Together they did several remixes, and later their
collaboration became better known as Macho Cat Garage, who did releases
on Viewlexx and Downlow and appeared on the DJ Hell mix CD on React.
Besides all this, Orgue Electronique has quite a reputation as a live
act, traveling all over the world: from the Hague to Detroit, from Tokyo
to New York, sharing the stage with many well known artists.

Catnip
    Catnip is the mysterious international team of producers bringing
you A1 classified raw electrodisco.

DJ TLR
    In the summer of love TLR started playing at punkparties in youth
homes that were later closed for asbestos threats. In 1996 he co-founded
Global Darkness and became involved in organising underground Jungle
parties in the totally freaked out and fucked up squat scene of the West
Coast of Holland area; filled with fundamentalists, attention junkies,
substance abusers, genetic experiments gone wrong and legions of crustie
tekno travellers like SP23 looking to escape the '94 Criminal Justice
Act and redefine noise pollution. In the late 90´s - when Jungle had
died a horrible death in Drum & Bass - he was swept away by the first
wave of The Hague electronics and the early works of I-F, Pametex and
Electronome when DJ Schmerlabor gave him some records at a Unit Moebius
gig. Their strange and exciting style was far removed from the mind
numbing lifetyle muzak that seemed to dominate the airwaves at the time
and refueled a love for electro in him that had been dormant since the
mid 80's. When introduced to the hidden treasures in the Clone
recordshop (that was then housed in a small and dark backroom of
Rotterdam´s Urban Unit) matters really got out of hand. TLR started
cultivating his newfound passion around ´98 when the bankrupt Bunker
label rose from its own ashes like a phoenix. Soon after the original
Global Darkness crew went separate ways. He made the Bunker Records
website and started Global Darkness, which silently grew into one of the
biggest and most active electro/disco communities on the Internet. In
2000 him and fellow dirty brown loser DJ Schmerzlabor (of Unit Moebius
fame) concocted the Bunker Records Dirty Brown World Tour and invited
Legowelt & Orgue Electronique (at that time one of the few Bunker live
acts) along to spread the dirty brown gospel. The Bunker Team was born
and he slowly rediscovered the early Freewave pirate radio Italo/disco
sounds of his childhood through the mixes of I-F and sunday afternoon
tea sessions in the luxurious mansions of Legowelt and Orgue
Electronique. And then the sky went open (insert trumpets here). It
didn't take long before the boys myth of grandeur became a reality, and
they've been touring ever since. The end of 2001 saw the birth of the
Crème Organization. What started out as a little playground for Mr
Clavio soon grew to more serious proportions with consecutive releases
of Lolita Strap, Bangkok Imoact and It & My Computer. Crème Organization
has been releasing on a rigorous schedule and quickly gained a cult
following. The following years shit got a little crazy for Crème and the
Bunker Team with several coast to coast US and Canadian tours, a bunch
Japanese tours and nonstop travel around Europe. In 2005 DJ TLR will
hold residencies Madrid but also in Tokyo and Osaka, introducing
European electro talent in Japan.

Subject: Re: Re: {pb-cle} To Scott and everybody

some people just work faster than others...dillinja knocks tracks out in
8hours.

me personally...i have to work quick....or else i loose focus...what i tend
to do is setup my samples(slice, timestretch)...then stop working...next
time i sit down to work...i do sound design, if im planning on using a synth
or twisting out a sample with the sampler...then i stop again...next time i
sit down...i lay down the groove...then i stop again...next time i sit down
i sequence....stop again...then i nail the mixdown and mastering...for the
last 6 or so months this is the workflow i tend to follow regardless of the
genre of music im making.

even tho im stopping and starting alot, im actually working quicker than if
i tried to do it all at once...when i try to do everything at one shot, i
tend to get stuck trying to make a sound thats never going to work,
work...after 6 hours of fiddling i loose interest and give up with exactly
no progress...but by forcing myself to stop even for just 40mins to an hour
to clear my head...i tend to actually get stuff closer to completion..

theres another factor to song writing too...people that actually have a good
understanding of musical theroy, ...especially tunings and
progressions...tend to work alot faster than someone who doesnt know theroy,
unless they are one of the rare people born with perfect pitch(to find out
if you have perfect pitch, have someone play a note at random on a piano and
see if you can even get close to the pitch and octave)...just cuz its that
much easier to nail your final mix....you'd be surprised how much fuller a
track can sound just by having everything properly tuned, even your
drums...when the drums are tuned right, you dont really need any effects
other than a decent eq and maybe a compressor on the kick if you are going
for that kinda sound.

btw tom...the reason alot of albums were cut in such short amounts of time,
is cuz thats all the tracking time the band could afford...back in the days
of recording to 1" or 2"...most of your recording budget was spent on
tapes....i think a  2" reel costs about $160 or so....and thats about
what....40mins of time at 30ips?  depending how much material you wanted to
lay down, and how many tracks you needed to use, you could spend upwards of
2grand(dont forget about the backup reels, just about every label, industry
or independent require backups)on tape....granted that figure is for a
pretty elaborate session, assuming there is alot of channels being used and
nothing is submixed...but lets say its a less elaborate session....something
that could be done on 16tracks...you are still looking at 88bux a
reel....and you still only get 40mins on the tape...thats why everyone is
going digital til the final mixdown....not only is it alot cheaper to get a
protools system(even the most tricked out HD:192 system is probably 10grand
cheaper than an otari 2"), hard disk space is cheaper than tape....oh
yeah...and editing digital shit is piss simple...i tried splicing a tape
once...it wasnt pretty sounding, but i guess thats an accquired skill, the
more you do it, the better you get

just my point oh two anyways

time to work on some tunes.

musical influences take there time in the studio and produce music with
outstanding substance, and it sometimes takes them years to get it done.
(Nine Inch Nails, Tool, Shpongle, Future Sound Of London, Radiohead, blah
blah blah)  It's hard to comment on this without offending poeple, but house
music for instance.  I enjoy listening to it, but I could never compose
house music.  Not on purpose anyway.  If something I wrote sounded like
house, it probably wouldn't be intentional.  The point is, my heart wouldn't
be into it.  I think the fact that a dude can bang out 3 tracks in a day,
might say a little something for the said style.  It doesn't say that that
style is less than any other, but maybe that it takes a little less time to
produce.  I'm going for kind of an epic style here, and it takes some time
to gather inspiration to pull it off just right.  When I say 24 hours to get
the bases laid, I mean, 24 hours of dicking around after a long day of work,
but not really getting anything accomplished.  Than going out on saturday
nights and partying, coming home on sunday feeling completely inspired,
reworking the grooves a bit, and then jam the son of a bitch out.  i don't
know man, interesting debate here.  I love it.

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP (kinda): 'Like new' Canon A80 still up for sale

Remember my camera I was selling a bit back?  Well it's back up for 
sale since the other people that were thinking about it can't get it 
now.  I don't feel like typing all the details again.  But I've only 
had it for like 6 months.  Still looks new.  Just selling it 'cause I'm 
getting a newer camera that came out and want to do this while the 
price difference between the two isn't that much.  Price is 225 for all 
the original stuff that came with the camera and I'll include this 
little screen protectors for it as well.  Just search for canon A80 on 
google and you'll get tons of info.  I MUST know by monday night since 
that's when I'm ordering the new one to get here by friday for toronto! 
  Hit me up private if interested.  I'm in northeast ohio. (just north 
of kent)

>Interesting point.  However, it just so happens that some of my 
major musical influences take there time in the studio and produce 
music with outstanding substance, and it sometimes takes them 
years to get it done.  (Nine Inch Nails, Tool, Shpongle, Future 
Sound Of London, Radiohead, blah blah blah) 

and ill talk shit on them, too. the beatles entire output was 
composed and recorded in less than 7 years. theres no excuse for 
taking that long. 

>I think the fact that a dude can bang out 3 tracks in a day, 
might say a little something for the said style.

obviously youre not familiar with how insanely great and classic 
all 3 of those tracks are. honestly, i would put that record up 
against any 12" ever produced in any genre ever in terms of great 
songwriting and innovative production.

i will say that working with samples can be crazily time 
intensive. this is why drum machines are your friends, all those 
drum sounds are already in there :)

thats not necessarily true. its all about knowing what sounds 
good, reguardless of whether something is in tune. shawn rudiman 
can crank tracks out that are crazily melodic and complex in 
arrangement in a very very short period of time because he knows 
what sounds good.

sure, but this is my point: sitting there trying to attain 
perfection over long periods of time in the studio is not really 
the best way to work. usually all you need is some inspiration and 
just hammer that bitch out. shouldnt take all day, unless youre 
doing some crazy orchestral shit or smashing pumpkins stylee 92 
guitar overdubs.

Subject: Re: Re: {pb-cle} To Scott and everybody

id say someone like shawn rudiman probably has natural perfect pitch...ie
even tho he may or may not have taken some sort of music instruction(i dunno
what his educational backround is, so i wont speculate)...he can naturally
tell when things are in tune or not in tune...kinda like being able to sing
great without being able to read music...but regardless of that...computer
based composing is dependent on the science of music theroy...thats why
theres a piano roll and a staff in the full on sequencers.


drum machines are fun no doubt...but a synth snare and a real snare really
sound different....a snare that has been mic'd top and bottom has alot more
character than an 808 or 909 snare...in the real world the snares on the
bottom of the drum will never vibrate the same way twice(thats why the good
sample cd's give you 50 hits of the same snare) im not saying one is better
than the other mind you....i usually use sampled snares along with synth
snares to get the best of both worlds...im really into layered drums...i try
to layer my drums in such a way that you think its just one great sounding
sample for the kick or the snare...thats where tuning really comes into play
imho...yeah ill use the odd drum loop here or there...but thats usually to
add some fullness...i usually high pass the drum loop too...so im only
getting the higher freqs so the kick doesnt interfere with my heavily
layered programmed drums...or ill use a drum loop as a fill along with the
same fill programmed over top it with the samples for the drum sampler

Subject: {pb-cle} FUZZ @ the BBT this week...

If you missed this weeks installment of Fuzz feat. Silver, I feel
sorry for you.  Prit near record breaking croud, incredible vibe. 
This week we have planned yet another crazy night, something differn't
from the Ohm Resistance crew, Temulent + some local favez.

A durrtay durrtay Fuzz!Head! Birthday rave! 
Come rejoyce as Shell the door money collector type chick turns 21!!! 

To help us celebrate, we have insourced:

TEMULENT - Detroit, MI - Ohm Resistance, Obliterati, A Los Luchadors
De Muerto (Los Luchadors of Death) for those of us who only speak
engrish! As one of the venerable Ohm Resistance founding members,
Temulent has become synonymous with the acerbic sounds of his new
label, Obliterati. Expect nothing less than a trademark
skull-splitting breaks and bass onslaught that has been pushing the
boundaries of the dark floor sound for seven years! No shit, eh?

ALASKA - 236PurpleWhipPossee - Get your chocolate sundae on Wednesday!

JEA LEIGH - Control The Night - All the class, poise, and grace of
Cleveland - Meets Iron City!! Ms. Thunderbutt herself will be playing
an atmospheric-ish set, so, don't even consider staying home, pansy
bitches!


We're being evil this week. The cover for this special event is $3.
Yes that still includes FREE WINGS and FREE FRIES. If you're that
hungry, and can't round up $3, perhaps you can eat a dick! Proceeds
benefit the "Ok, what the fuck do we do with this money now that its
ours???" fund, so it IS for a good cause!

This shit goes down on the weekly yo! 10-ish in the pm til 2-ish in
the am! Ya heard? The BBT is located at 4412 East Liberty Avenue,
Bloomfield, Pittsburgh, Penns Woods, Earth. Mapquest it, geeks!

Oh, yeah, we still rock the $2 Iron Drafts. Iron City - Just try and
outsoruce THIS!

If your ID doesn't say that you're 21, you can forget about it, kid.

its not even about being in key or in tune, but about sounding 
good. you can play things in different keys at the same time (see 
jazz music) and itll still sound good. its easier if you know what 
youre doing, but if you cant tell dissonance from melody/harmony, 
youre not making music.

theroy...thats why

thats not necessarily true, unless youre not playing melodies at 
all. i use a computer to sequence, but i play all my shit from a 
midi keyboard and only quantize in extremely necessary cases. this 
is how music is made, is it not? if youre just clicking notes in a 
piano roll, ill go on record as calling that "not making music".

sounding

comes into play
>imho...

yeah i use the same approach these days, but ive discovered 
something really fanstastically great about the hr-16 drum 
machine: you can easily and quickly set each sound's midi note 
number. so i program all my drums on there, then just play it back 
into my sequencer for layering with samples. its great because you 
get the drum machine feel and sound palette but you can easily 
augment it with samples in addition or instead of without getting 
into boring computer drum programming.

to

i still cant just jack a drum loop. ive really wanted to, i just 
feel really cheap when i do it. its a really easy way to add 
feeling to a drum track without doing much work, but i cant do it.

			Ok, the debate was cool.  Still is.  However, Mr. COx, you just had to break out the beatles reference didn't you?  You sound like every jaded old fuck I've ever met.  Hahaha.  That's ok though.  I respect the beatles and everything, their music rocks.  The point of the matter is though, that good music comes in many different shapes, colors, styles (awwww).  It doesn't matter how it's done, what does matter is that it is, and how the end result sounds.  So the debate has reached a close.  And as far as this dude who banged out 3 songs in one day, I would like to hear it, honestly.  I'll keep my eyes open for it.  All, I know is, I wanna play live really bad.  Who would come see me if I did a live set?

>Ok, the debate was cool.  Still is.  However, Mr. COx, you just 
had to break out the beatles reference didn't you?  You sound like 
every jaded old fuck I've ever met.  Hahaha.  That's ok though.  I 
respect the beatles and everything, their music rocks.  

i dont see why its "jaded" to point out that one of the greatest 
pop music artists of all time didnt take years and years to write 
stuff while other "artists" anguish for years over a bunch of 
crapola. 

>The point of the matter is though, that good music comes in many 
different shapes, colors, styles (awwww).  It doesn't matter how 
it's done, what does matter is that it is, and how the end result 
sounds.  So the debate has reached a close.

maybe for you it has. but of course for me, i just sit here and 
marvel at how little of a clue some people can have about music. 

>And as far as this dude who banged out 3 songs in one day, I 
would like to hear it, honestly.  I'll keep my eyes open for it.

that fact that youve never heard "can you feel it?" just makes you 
look pretty much like a fool. larry heard would shit all over you 
and it wouldnt take him days to do it. 

>All, I know is, I wanna play live really bad.  Who would come see 
me if I did a live set?

what makes you think you should be doing a live set? ive seen many 
live electronic performances, maybe 5 of them were justified in 
terms of what the artists had to say (not counting personal 
friends of mine, whom im obviously biased for). i doubt anyone 
would want to sit around for 24 hours while you work out the 
basics.

			First of all, that kinda hurt a bit dude.

Second off, have you ever just sat back and wondered "maybe I'm just an asshole."

Cuz I really wasn't attacking you in any way.  Your very violent.  I used to be like that though.  "Poeple just HAVE to agree with my opinions.  If they don't, then they are inferior to me."  I know I said you sounded like every jaded old fuck I ever met, but it's cuz you kinda do.  I'd like to hear some of your tracks.  For someone to be so firey in opinons, you must be quite talented yourself.  Also, I know I said i'd never heard of godod ole' larry heards stuff, but I said I'd like to.  You funnny,  you little guy.  Bite a little harder this next time.

yeah its funny, i do this thing where i dont let people hear stuff 
until im satisfied with the results. a few of my closest friends 
hear random mixdowns i do when experimenting with new and 
different techniques or when im checking my bass levels, but 
mostly i knock out some stuff, get dissatisfied with it, and it 
gets relegated to the "not for public consumption" pile. youll 
never hear derivative crap from me, nor will you hear unfinished 
portions of tracks. thats not how i get down, i dont need to post 
shit on the internet to get feedback from people whose musical 
opinions i dont care about. the only person i try to satisfy is 
me, once thats done, then other people can hear my stuff.

i dont make music to sell. so the answer is zero. is that better 
for you? do you feel like youve won because i dont try to force 
sub-par music on people, unlike every other "producer" on the 
internet? haha. some peoples' motivations for doing things are not 
the same as others'. i wonder what makes you think that if i did 
do something i wanted people to hear that i would let you know it 
was mine anyway?

I totally dig this attitude toward music production / distribution.   Less self-marketing, more focus on musical substance.

 

 

 some peoples' motivations for doing things are not 
the same as others'. i wonder what makes you think that if i did 
do something i wanted people to hear that i would let you know it 
was mine anyway?

<<i dont make music to sell. so the answer is zero. is that better for you?>>

that's not what i asked. i asked, "how many tracks have you released".

while i understand that, yes, "releasing" can easily be attached to "selling", that's not the only
connotation.

i have never sold one of my songs. i have no interest in selling the music i've made. but i've put
my music online for others to hear and critique (yourself included), and i've played it in public
forums (havana, zythos, bikki) for people to hear.

if you make music, but no one ever hears it besides yourself, are you really making anything....or
are you just jacking off into some headphones?

and that pure BULLSHIT you spout about "forcing" music on people? come the fuck on, dude. you're
smart enough to know when you're talking out your ass.

the guy put up a link for people to check out what he's been doing and you pop up and piss all over
it like someone's obnoxious drunk uncle at a wedding. if anyone's forcing anything around here, it's
you forcing your bullshit opinions on people who are just trying to make some music and share it
with people.

you talk more shit on people and their attempts at creativity than any 5 motherfuckers around here,
and you have NOTHING to show for it.

weak. sauce.

All arguments aside, you really should go listen to "Can You Feel it"
and "Washing Machine" by Mr. Fingers.  From the mid 80s.  If they
don't blow your mind then I dunno what to say.

There like a Pb-Cle FAQ somewhere.  With a "Yes, he's an asshole"
right across the top.

But occasionally, he pops off a bit of gold.

the music i've made. but i've put

included), and i've played it in public
>forums (havana, zythos, bikki) for people to hear.

as your own, technically selling it. but thats not my point, i 
wasnt being critical of you, i was just pointing out my philosophy 
on making my own shit. 

>if you make music, but no one ever hears it besides yourself, are 
you really making anything....or
>are you just jacking off into some headphones?

i make music the same way i deejay: i dont care what other people 
think about it. if theyre into it, thats cool. if im into it, 
thats all that matters to me. you call it jacking off, i call it 
the only real reason to be making music. if you cant make shit and 
not let people hear it and just be happy with that, youre in it 
for something else: glory, fame, money, something. 

>and that pure BULLSHIT you spout about "forcing" music on people? 
come the fuck on, dude. you're
>smart enough to know when you're talking out your ass.

im not sure why you think thats the case. when someone says "hey, 
check out my music" if you dont check it out i think thats pretty 
rude. i always DL every single track posted in any forum i 
participate in. 

>the guy put up a link for people to check out what he's been 
doing and you pop up and piss all over
>it like someone's obnoxious drunk uncle at a wedding. if anyone's 
forcing anything around here, it's
>you forcing your bullshit opinions on people who are just trying 
to make some music and share it
>with people.

i only share my opinion with people who ask for it. and usually my 
critiques are dealing with individuality of peoples tracks. this 
is why my shit isnt out there for people to hear, i dont find it 
disticntive enough. trying to find your own style doesnt 
necessarily come immediately. i own lots of records by people who 
came out of "nowhere" who were behind the scenes for years working 
on their sound, and very very few records by people who really did 
come out of nowhere with their own thing right away (recloose 
being the main example i can think of, his first studio sessions 
were his first 12" which is crazily impressive, though i dont know 
how much help he had from other people.). IMO not every person 
needs to be making tunes. i think everyone should try, but people 
making derivative crapola just isnt entertaining to me. i try to 
critique bad mixdowns and shit as little as possible because i 
understand theres lots of different possible sounds that people 
might want to hear. the only thing i come down hard on is lack of 
originality. theres already way too much color-by-numbers dance 
music. 

>you talk more shit on people and their attempts at creativity 
than any 5 motherfuckers around here,
>and you have NOTHING to show for it.

not exactly correct, i have NOTHING for YOU to see to show for it. 
every time i hear some joker putting up tracks that have no 
business being heard by people i realise my approach is correct. i 
know that i dont need other peoples opinions for my shit. i know 
what i need to hear to be satisfied. my standards are obviously 
much different than most peoples', judging by most of the crap i 
hear. i can remember listening to venetian snares' stuff on the 
net before he was signed anywhere, and i was like "damn, this guy 
has got his own sound". i think maybe ive heard that from one 
other unsigned person since then.

			Ok ok ok.  When I first posted this track, I believe I said "Hay, I thought you guys might be interested in hearing this track.  I hope you enjoy it, as much as I enjoyed making it.  No big deal really."  And here we are now.  honestly, Mr. Cox, you have offered some very valid points and given me things to think about.  However, the point of mine has been completely missed.  There are 2 reasons why I'm into writing music. 1.)Because I love doing it. 2.)Because I wanna make poeple party there asses off.I'm not trying to do these "amazing" studio sessions.  For some reason, you seem really on the defense about something.  Which really makes me wanna hear your tunes.  I'm gonna be throwing up the first CD I ever recorded very soon.  Did it back when I was 16.  Used a Yamaha RM1x, a Roland JV-1010, and a Roland XP10 to do it all.  It's probably one of the biggest peices of garbage ever created by one man.  Interesting to hear though.  I have no problem releasing crap whatsoever.  You take this shit WAY to seriously man.  You suck the fun right out of it.  For instance, Larry Heard, when he banged out those tunes, do you think he sat back and thought "Wow, everyone's gonna think I'm a genious for this, esp. Tom Cox".  No, I doubt it.  If anyone can point me in the direction of where I might find these tracks, please help me out.

I'm going to have to agree with Tom on this one.  I don't think anybody 
should release for public consumption until they feel satisfied with the 
results.  It's nice to get some extra ears on stuff but its very hard to 
find people that are crtitical yet positive so I can understand just not 
releasing anything.

Subject: Re: Re: {pb-cle} To Scott and everybody

there is most definately a theroy to jazz...im pretty sure you can major in
jazz theroy most art schools...all jazz improv is based on scales...in high
school i had a whole book of jazz/blues scales...ive been looking for it in
my boxes of stuff...but i think my sister jacked it and lost it.

i use the keyboard to play stuff in sometimes...most times i just figure out
my pitches with it...then draw it out...my keyboarding skills on a piano
suck....kinda weird cuz i can type probably 100words a min on a qwerty
keyboard....im sure if i took some piano lessons and learned the trick to
it(theres a trick to everything)id be decent

Subject: Re: Re: {pb-cle} To Scott and everybody

with most loop samplers now(dr rex, kontakt, intakt, newer emu's)you can
mangle a loop in such a way that its still rythmically correct, but it
sounds totally different...for instance...i can load up the apache break in
dr rex...by just filtering it, modulating the filter with lfo and the filter
env i can turn the drum break into a glitchy sh-101 type sound....using
loops is all about how creative you get with them...you are supposed to be
creative when you make music...by having the mindset that loops are off
limits you are definately limiting yourself

check out the roland vp-9000 or melodyne if you wanna get into serious loop
mangling.

Anyone willing to give me a ride down?
I been driving on a spare for a month and I don't want to do 50 miles
on it for fear of ..... dying driving down to go see mister DSLBoy lol

There's bunch of people I could ask in person but I'll just throw this out here.

oh and yeah I dont want to get home at some crazy hours, working monday morning!

Subject: Re: Re: {pb-cle} To Scott and everybody

I've looked into the vp9000 they have come down in price a lot.  I don't 
think I want anymore digital hardware though.  The computer does most of 
that stuff really well.
I guess personally I place the "O'ness" on synthesis instead os sampling. 
I'm still exploring this end of the deal quite a bit.  I do a bit of cut 
abnd paste and wouldnt be completly off the idea of mangling my own loops. 
Infact I tend to work like this with cubase now i.e. get the ideas down and 
make a track and then go back over it and alter or tweak things (filter fx 
automation) after its been mixed down to 2 track.

What's with this sadistic impatience about the verdict?

All the male co-workers have been so impatient about this like it'll
determine their fate and their freedom to act upon their wives as
Mister Peterson previously did ! haha

I need a USB MIDI controller and I am wondering if anyone has a
recommendation?  I was just going to go with the vanilla M-Audio Radium 61
key but I saw the Korg MicroKONTROL and it has nifty MPC-esque pads but no
mod or pitch wheel just a "4 way joystick".  I'm open to other ideas.  In
conclusion, Libya is a land of contrast.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} SRR: MIDI controller recommendation

Depends on what your use is. A friend that just picked up a Monomachine 
swears by the microkontrol for control of it, but loves his Evo8 and 
UC16 for Ableton Live. I've got a 49 key Evo I love and a fatar sitting 
around I love for composition. but I use a setup similar to my friends 
for Ableton Live. I've also been known to use my Microkorg as both a 
controller and tone module driven by Live 4.

I've been eyeing the new Novation Reason controller that doubles as a 
sound card and a K-Station, but it's a little pricey, and I've never 
been partial to Novation's keys.

Knob Controller? Evolution UC-16. Nice Keys? Find a used Fatar. The 
MicroKONTROL keys are just too small to be practical, but the knobs, 
sliders and pads are kinda nifty. I've yet to see anything I feel 
totally comfortable with that has keys and other methods of control, so 
if you want total pwnage, you may be looking at a combination of 
controllers. For the price right now, you'll get better quality out of 
two controllers.

WEE!

Thanks, I forgot to mention the small keys but yeah I knew about them and I

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fatboy

I caught Fatboy Slim at the Hammerstein Ballroom NYC back in 1999.  
Incredible show.  They had Norman Cook set up in the middle of the room on a 
rotating stage so that he just slowly spun around in circles during his 
whole 2 hour set.

Scratch Perverts played a killer set before him as well ... and also there 
was a DJ set from the Lo Fi Allstars.

The whole night was a blast.

I don't know. Maybe he's too expensive. I heard $25k. Getting the kind of

he also tends to hole up when doing production stuff...and not really come out until he's done.

i guess he's just been around long enough to know when he's done with a project and not really have
to "road test" it the way a lot of other artists do...

If Oakenfold and company can get a big enough crowd together, I'm
certain that Fatboy Slim can get a sold-out capacity show as well.

			ok, not saying anyone would want it, but I have a full album available.  It's only 14.99.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! I could almost hear everyone puttin up there fists.  Shit, if you guys want the full Cognitive Chaos album, either beg me to get off my lazy ass and send it through the mail, or hit me up on AIM, screen name DJScythian.  If you got Dick Suckin Lips, should only take about an hour for me to transfer it to you.  I mean, it's a free CD.  Actually, a double disc.  I don't think you could fit it all on one CD.  I won't sue you like metallica would either.  So step up, take The Scythian challenge.  So obviously, I'm not looking for money.  What I am looking for, is an audience.  I've read comments by certain someone, saying "I don't care what the poeple think".  This person has the audacity to call themselves a DJ?  The only reason your on stage is because the good poeple pay there way to see ya, and you don't care what they think?  i find that hard to believe.  I play for the poeple.  You guys don't like what your hearing, I have NO problem whatsoever hearing about it, because the poeple are the reason I do it.  So to tackle the Money and Fame accusations, Money, Not really.  I've lived in near piles of shit before, but didn't care, cuz I always had my slowly building studio and the chance of being on stage again.  Fame, on the other hand, yes, I am looking for it, but only because that fame would bring poeple together, in one of the biggest, most tranced out jams ever seen on the earth.  I need the poeple there.  I need you guys there.  if I have my say, (which I probably won't unfortunately), there would be no charge.  Fuck, I'd buy all the beer.  Someone give me a house to throw a party damnit.  I'll take money out of my own hard earned work wallet to fuckin pay for the shit.  EVERYONE GETS IN!!!! COMPLETELY FREE!!!!!  I CAN JAM THIS SHIT!!!! I FUCKIN SWEAR IT!!!!!!

Because that's not funny, or witty in any way?

Seriously, it ain't hard to make email readable, instead of looking
like you're a tweaker on a mission.

God, wouldn't that be great for all of you,  If I was a tweaker?  Just another reason for you all to feel superior.  Funny thing is, I've never touched meth.  I think you've mistaken my passion for music with drug addiction.  Funny how we grasp at straws when we feel threatened by something.  Seriously, this is a call to arms now.

			The Scythian soldier scrapes the scalp clean of flesh and softening it by rubbing between the hands, uses it thenceforth as a napkin. The Scyth is proud of these scalps and hangs them from his bridle rein; the greater the number of such napkins that a man can show, the more highly is he esteemed among them. Many make themselves cloaks by sewing a quantity of these scalps together.....Such as the Scythian customs with respect to scalps."
The plant was probably introduced to Europe by the Scythians, a barbaric tribe from the Caucasus. The Greek traveller Herodotus (circa 500 BC) famously wrote of the Scyth warriors purifying themselves in steam baths filled with smoke from burning hemp seeds:

"They make a booth by fixing in the ground three sticks inclined toward one another, and stretching around them woollen pelts which they arrange so as to fit as close as possible: inside the booth a dish is placed upon the ground into which they put a number of red-hot stones and then add some hemp... immediately it smokes and gives out such a vapour that no Greek steam bath can surpass it... the Scyths howl with pleasure at these baths." 
Herodotus' claims were recently born out by archaeological finds of tripods, braziers and hemp seeds, just as he had described, in frozen Scythian tombs in central Asia.

God, wouldn't that be great for all of you,  If I was a tweaker?  Just
another reason for you all to feel superior.  Funny thing is, I've never
touched meth.  I think you've mistaken my passion for music with drug
addiction.  Funny how we grasp at straws when we feel threatened by

about partying, and forgetting about differences, let me know.  I do have
poeple willing to back me up and make shit happen.  Anyone who wants to be

anti-social little bitches, I don't really give a fuck.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best strong bad email ever

i'm thinkin' maybe an amiga?

i mean, a C64 be would a step backwards from the 386...but amigas were the shit...

maybe a nExt station? (steve jobs' failed attempt at recreating a mac w/o woz.)

i doubt he'd end up with something like a classic mac..."too much computer and not enough
typewriter"

perhaps he'll venture into the world of open source.....

I hang my head low now, and walk away a defeated man.  (gotta admire my spirit though, don't you?  maybe just a little?)

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  So far all but one person
thinks this is a good idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

A weekly event brought to you by S. SIMPSON from DynamixCrew.com
showcasing regional & local talent w/ resident DJ QUARTZ and guests.

Guest Dj for the Night:

DJ KARES -Boston, MA
"fresh off her birthday tour with Dj Baby Anne"

A fresh face in the dance scene, Dj Kares is already enamoring
partygoers across the country as her infectious positive attitude is
projected through her uplifting, crowd-energizing sets.  Her innate
ability to get a dance floor moving stems from her life-long passion for
music, and years spent as a cheerleader by day, then dancing all night
to the tunes of her favorite djs as she worked at several local
nightclubs. Spending most of her club-going career in Boston and New
York City, Kares cites her inspiration for jumping behind the decks as
the likes of dj greats Ferry Corsten, Armin van Buuren, and Paul Van
Dyk, and credits learning the tricks of the trade from several
dj/producer friends.  Dj Kares has showcased the refreshing style she
has created as predominantly a progressive trance dj (while maintaining
a strong breakbeat influence) at a variety of venues across the US. 
Cities she has played in include Miami, Jackson, Seattle, Portland, San
Diego, Boston, and Memphis.  Kares has also held a monthly residency in
Springfield, MA, and is called upon by magazines such as Glamour to drop
energetic beats for the models at their fashion shows.

Also with Resident Dj:

Sun Nov 21                      TORTURED SOUL                     Cleveland

11/21 - Tortured Soul / Aphrodesiatics / MisterBradleyP - 9pm $8 adv / $10 dos  - 11/21 - 
Tortured Soul / Aphrodesiatics / MisterBradleyP - 9pm $8 adv / $10 dos  Tortured Soul is 
music that will move you. It's a new concept in the world of house music: it's live. The 
instrumentation is simple and organic - drums, electric bass, vintage keys, and soulful 
vocals. Tortured Soul filters club sounds like Afro Beat and Samba through a lens of jazzy 
House and American Soul to reflect intense grooves evocative of Jamiroquai, Stevie Wonder, 
The New Deal, and Fela Kuti. May 2004 marks the release of Tortured Soul's debut full-length 
album, "Introducing Tortured Soul" on Purpose Records. It showcases their live tracks, as 
well as studio productions and re-mixes, and coincides with an aggressive touring schedule 
covering the US, Canada, Japan and Europe. Spring and Summer of 2004 also sees Tortured Soul 
spotlighted with several tracks on Moonshine's upcoming Central Park Compilation and the 
upbeat Central Park single release of "Fall In Love," newly remixed by Eric Kupper. 
Recently, Tortured Soul was featured on DJ Spinna's album, 'Here to There' with a funky 
remake of his classic track, "Rock." Tortured Soul was conceived in May 2001 by drummer, 
singer, and songwriter Christian Urich - known in the world of house and R&B as founder and 
leader of the band Cooly's Hot Box. The single "We Don't Have To Be Alone" introduced 
Cooly's Hot Box to the house music world, and their acid jazz classic "Don't Throw My Love 
Around" on Polygram's London/Payday Records is featured on the first Giant Step compilation 
and as the hook for Armond Van Heldon's "Funk Phenomenon." Urich has worked with such 
producers as Reggie Lucas (Madonna, Stephanie Mills), DJ Spinna, and Roger Sanchez (on his 
album First Contact.) The first Tortured Soul single for Central Park Recordings was the 
now-classic house track "I Might Do Something Wrong" re-mixed by Osunlade. The track was an 
immediate success, playing weekly at New York's legendary party Body & Soul and altering the 
sound of Central Park Recordings. Inspired by Tortured Soul the label turned in a new 
direction, and focused on the fusion of soul with deep house music.

Sat Nov 27                      ANDY CALDWELL                     Cleveland

Saturday, November 27 _ Thanksgiving Weekend:

Andy Caldwell
(Om, Naked, Inspirit) San Francisco

Bay Area native Andy Caldwell had a passion for the art of music long
before the advent of electronica, and a decade before embarking on a
career in deejaying, producing and songwriting. But true musical
expression for Andy hit all new levels in the wake of San Francisco's
underground rave explosion, when the one-time concert trumpeter and
piano player subordinated his horn and foot-pedals in favor of two
turntables and a bag of vinyl.

Caldwell's first track "Superfunkidiculous" was released in 1994 and
quickly became a top hit throughout the club scene, leading to a
collaboration project with childhood friend Gabriel René. Forming the
highly acclaimed San Francisco band "Soulstice", Caldwell and René
produced and wrote music for the release of the band's album "Illusion"
and the renowned remix album, "Mixed Illusions." During that time,
Caldwell also created a steady stream of his own celebrated releases
for OM Records including three stand-alone, single releases, as well as
releases featured on Mark Farina's widely popular Mushroom Jazz series.

His singles were also included on six consecutive Om Lounge
compilations and two full-length mix CDs entitled Sounds of Om v. 2.
Caldwell's now seminal Om Records' release, "I Can't Wait" has appeared 
on numerous compilations and has become a house music standard.

Other top singles for Caldwell include his popular Naked Music releases 
"All I Need", "Lectropic" and "Give A Little" as well as remixes for 
Migs, Owusu and Greene and Arvid. He's also recorded and released 
"Pushin" and "Don't Hold Back" for Inspirit Music's InSoul Sessions v. 1 
and InHouse Perspectives 02, albums that he also mixed. He has also 
collaborated with DJ/producer Behrouz on their single "Be Free" and 
several remixes for the Yoshitoshi label, including the Grammy nominated 
track "Safe From Harm" by Narcotic Thrust, "Never Felt this Way" by Hani 
featured on Deep Dish's Toronto mix for Global Underground as well as a 
remix of UNO recordings first release "Too Late" by Mei-Lwun.

Further expanding his reach, Caldwell's signature production style is
also recognized in the film and television industries. He has composed
music for films such as Forces of Nature and Skulls, as well as popular
television series: Six Feet Under, Boston Public, and Chromium Blue.

At age 31, with an ever-expanding discography, Caldwell has only just
begun to fulfill his passion for music, with frequent DJ tours, remix
opportunities and production work. For the past 3 years, his DJ
schedule has allowed him to share his love of music with fans around
the world, playing records in every major city on every continent.

Support DJs TBA

Only $5.00!

Jason Lyman and Douglas Black present:

DEMARKUS LEWIS(Vista, Aesoteric, Freaked, Flat & Round) Dallas, TX

Demarkus Lewis has been heavily submerged in the world of dance music 
for the past fourteen years. He is currently one of House Music's 
hardest working artists and is in high demand around the World. 
Production is the main driving force behind his craft but he will tell 
you that there is nothing like a good crowd to beat down with great 
tunes.

As well D.j'ing, Demarkus finds time to hold down two weekly residencies 
at Dallas' prime time nightspots the Zubar (Fridays) and at The Pharmacy 
(Saturdays). He also co-founded Grin Music Artist Management with his 
wife, Kelly and currently work together booking both veteran house dj’s 
as well as up and coming favorites. In 2004, stepping up and moving 
forward seems to hold great rewards for him as he increases his 
knowledge and love of good music and continues on with many great new 
releases.

As the DJ for the Sopranos After-Emmy's party, the mixmaster at the

*****************CANCELLED********************

Evolution and Breakline Crew Present... ELEMENTS OF LIFE

FREE GIVEAWAYS BY UFO Clothing!!

Friday, December 10th 2004
Cleveland, Ohio

**IN THIER FIRST EVER PREFORMANCE TOGETHER***
-XAVIER, KOS, AND MC FLIPSIDE (House, Hard House, Live PA)
Xavier and Kos are artists that are one of a kind. When the table is set 
and the crowd is in full force, they drop the high-energy funk that 
crushes dances floors and makes the walls shake. Now with the addition 
of MC Flipsides the party is sure to be hyped!

-Kaos - (Philly - Human Imprint, Habit, Violence, Atlas, Circle, 
Breakline Crew) DnB
Fresh off tour with Dieselboy and a nationally publicized tour sponsored 
by SALEM, Kaos has maintained his status as one of the key figures of 
the Human Imprint label as well as having releases out or slated on 
Violence, Atlas, Renegade Hardware, Habit and Circle, as well as 
remixing tunes for drum and bass greats such as Bad Company. Recently 
featured on the cover of the d'n'b publication Rinse Magazine, Kaos is 
still holding tight as production partner to Dieselboy.

-Annalyze (Rochester, NY - Stanton, Breakline Crew) Breakbeat turntablist
NY's own DJ Annalyze has played all over the US & Canada alongside DJ's 
Baby Anne, Shortee, Q-bert, Rap, Aphrodite, Jackal, Danny the Wildchild 
& much more . She has made appearance at the Winter NAMM show in 2003 & 
2004 and also did spot dates for The VANS Warp Tour in 2002 & 2003. 
Earning a sponsorship by Stanton Magnetics, Anna & her scratch partner 
DJ Shortee form Stanton’s first female scratch duo "Twice as Nice.” 
Anna combines breakbeat and electro with DMC style trickery & is known 
for rocking the crowd!.

-DJ Booth (Louisville, KY – Urban Loops, UFO Jeans, 4-Score) House
Fists in the air: Chaos reigns. For 8 years DJ Booth has dominated the 
midwest, headlining with international acts and struggling for what he 
now holds so dear – an extensive play history of dates nationally and 
internationally, an insurmountable fan base, multiple original 
compositions released nationwide, six mixed CD's, an appointment as a 
promotional rep by the UFO clothing company, and a rockin' remix of "Up 
to You" by Robbie Hardkiss of the famous Hardkiss brothers.

-Rob Riddum (Cleveland – J&N Media) Dnb/Hip-Hop turntablist
One of the key figures of the Element Squad returns to Cleveland. While 
in LA, Rob was working out of the old Beastie Boys’ studio “Grand 
Royale” where his main project was www.bradleyhiphop.com. Rob recently 
took home 3rd place at the Salt Lake City DMC. Come see this old skool 
turntablist wreck the decks.

-Kryteria (Curtis R & Patrick Felony – Miami – Breakline Crew) DnB
Playing prestigious events like Ultra Music Festival, Global Gathering, 
and Magical Maydaze has many djs and producers stateside and worldwide 
supporting this dynamic duo by playing their tunes and crowds all over 
are eating them up! With the likes of Karl K and Kaos behind these 
original bad boys none can contest!

-Ewun & Code-D (Rochester, NY – Evol Intent Recordings, Rocdnb, 
Skyehigh, Breakline Crew, La Selva) DnB/Dancehall/Turntablism
Ewun and Code-D are two of NY’s most versatile dj's. Known for creative 
mixes and impressive scratch abilities, these two have grown to become 
professionals behind the decks. Code-D has mastered the ability to 
switch styles with ease and his scratching skills are sharp. Ewun has 
just been signed to Evol Intent Recordings, with other releases in the 
works on some of the industries top labels. With DJ support from Evol 
Intent, Tech Itch, Dylan, B-Key, just to name a few, expect to hear a 
lot of noise from this rising artist.

-The Lady Foursquare - (Louisville, KY - UFO Jeans) House
Name another woman who can hold it down right beside Paul Johnson after 
DEMF 2002, tag with Trevor Lamont (Teamsters), share a residency with 
DJs Kit Chaps of VHS or Beta (Astralwerks) and rock the main stage next 
to Terry Mullan, Diego Ro-k and Dieselboy: Foursquare is supporting UFO 
Jeans and her CD, "What Happened?" this fall.

-Jon Doe ( Skratch Fienz / Cleveland) DNB, Hip Hop, Turntablism
Jon Doe is one of the most talented DJ's in Cleveland and yet unknown to 
those outside Cleveland. Jon Doe has been spinning for over 10 years now 
and continues to progress every day. Jon Doe works seven days a week, 
almost twelve hours a day, but he always finds time to get out and play, 
doing what he loves most, blowing ur mind. Talented in so many different 
areas of music Jon Doe is sure to impress!

-Robtronix and MC Barrenzemo (Koala Tea / P3 - DNB & MC) Cleveland
His funky flavor will captivate you within the first second of hearing 
him. Don't let him fool ya by the "i'm a nice boy" smile, like anyone of 
us we have a bad side and he puts that into his music. His thoughts are 
the drums and bass, his voice is the scratch.

-Shagge (Breaks) Cleveland
Shagge is one of the most amazing Breaks DJ's u will ever see...No more 
needs to be said!

-DJ Moose (Break Beat Militia / Breaks, Jump Up Jungle) Cleveland
Moose's unique style sprouts from his hip-hop influence. Blending 
hip-hop with breaks and jungle as well as keeping the crowd entertained 
has been moose's goal and motivation from the start. "All I want to do 
is make the whole crowd bounce, yall!", a sample of Snoop Doggy Dogg in 
a J-Smooth track, is what Moose uses as a slogan for every performance.

Info:

Legowelt
    Legowelt = the name under which Danny Wolfers releases most of his
music. What Music you might ask??? Well a hybrid form of slam jack The
Hague electronix combined with deep chicago trax,obscure & romantic
ghetto technofunk, EuroHorror Soundtracks and lots -a- more! You can't
quite pigeonhole it but it sure as hell slams the pit!
    Already a few years in the business Legowelt has released a dozen or
so projects on various formats, most of them on good ol' vinyl released
on homebase Bunker records, The Hague's legendary pioneering electronic
music label. Sometimes these tracks spin out of the obscurity like an
asteroid from a spacebelt and fly straight into the charts; such an
event happened with 'Disco Rout' which was voted track of the year 2002
by the acclaimed german Groove magazine.
    Legowelt began producing music when in the early 90ies the
adolescent autistic schoolboy came in sporadic contact with the sounds
of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably
his all-time favorite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley
Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and mr.Fingers. Later on this palette of
influences grew with early Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, various stuff
from The Irdial Discs label and virtually every type of freaked deep
music he could get his hands on.
    But nothing had quite the influence of when, somewhere in the early
90ies, he first heard a band called 'Unit Moebius' on the radio. A punky
palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi chicago trax and deep detroit jams made
with machines which were found next to the garbage can. Shocked in awe
he heard that this music came out of The Hague, Holland The very same
city he lived in! Put on the right track by this fact he stumbled into
the Bunker Records office and discoverd a world of contemporary autistic
freaked music lovers who looked beyond all the bland house and dance
music that ruled the media and clubs. Musical mentors such as IF and
Melvin White (aka pametex) lectured him with even more unknown sounds
such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco which
production secrets were closely studied. In 1998 Bunker released the
first vinyl of Legowelt : Pimpshifter, a 6 track mingled Italo Chicago
combi which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as 'Stumvogel'
and 'Total Pussy Control'.

Luke Eargoggle
    Deep, dark and slow, a black hole encroachment of your mind! Empty
cold pametex-style electro from the nordic territories, a sinister film
noir movie soundtrack, chillin'!

Orgue Electronique
    Orgue Electronique (Brian Chinetti) is the master of the staccato
minimal electro-nic sound with unexpected melodies and haunting tensions
in between beats. Orgue Electronique is not only known for the releases
he did on Bunker (the most searched cult-hit "The Eye That Never
Sleeps"), Stilleben (Arcadia full length album) and various
compilations, but also for his collaborations with Legowelt on Bunker
Records. Together they did several remixes, and later their
collaboration became better known as Macho Cat Garage, who did releases
on Viewlexx and Downlow and appeared on the DJ Hell mix CD on React.
Besides all this, Orgue Electronique has quite a reputation as a live
act, traveling all over the world: from the Hague to Detroit, from Tokyo
to New York, sharing the stage with many well known artists.

Catnip
    Catnip is the mysterious international team of producers bringing
you A1 classified raw electrodisco.

DJ TLR
    In the summer of love TLR started playing at punkparties in youth
homes that were later closed for asbestos threats. In 1996 he co-founded
Global Darkness and became involved in organising underground Jungle
parties in the totally freaked out and fucked up squat scene of the West
Coast of Holland area; filled with fundamentalists, attention junkies,
substance abusers, genetic experiments gone wrong and legions of crustie
tekno travellers like SP23 looking to escape the '94 Criminal Justice
Act and redefine noise pollution. In the late 90´s - when Jungle had
died a horrible death in Drum & Bass - he was swept away by the first
wave of The Hague electronics and the early works of I-F, Pametex and
Electronome when DJ Schmerlabor gave him some records at a Unit Moebius
gig. Their strange and exciting style was far removed from the mind
numbing lifetyle muzak that seemed to dominate the airwaves at the time
and refueled a love for electro in him that had been dormant since the
mid 80's. When introduced to the hidden treasures in the Clone
recordshop (that was then housed in a small and dark backroom of
Rotterdam´s Urban Unit) matters really got out of hand. TLR started
cultivating his newfound passion around ´98 when the bankrupt Bunker
label rose from its own ashes like a phoenix. Soon after the original
Global Darkness crew went separate ways. He made the Bunker Records
website and started Global Darkness, which silently grew into one of the
biggest and most active electro/disco communities on the Internet. In
2000 him and fellow dirty brown loser DJ Schmerzlabor (of Unit Moebius
fame) concocted the Bunker Records Dirty Brown World Tour and invited
Legowelt & Orgue Electronique (at that time one of the few Bunker live
acts) along to spread the dirty brown gospel. The Bunker Team was born
and he slowly rediscovered the early Freewave pirate radio Italo/disco
sounds of his childhood through the mixes of I-F and sunday afternoon
tea sessions in the luxurious mansions of Legowelt and Orgue
Electronique. And then the sky went open (insert trumpets here). It
didn't take long before the boys myth of grandeur became a reality, and
they've been touring ever since. The end of 2001 saw the birth of the
Crème Organization. What started out as a little playground for Mr
Clavio soon grew to more serious proportions with consecutive releases
of Lolita Strap, Bangkok Imoact and It & My Computer. Crème Organization
has been releasing on a rigorous schedule and quickly gained a cult
following. The following years shit got a little crazy for Crème and the
Bunker Team with several coast to coast US and Canadian tours, a bunch
Japanese tours and nonstop travel around Europe. In 2005 DJ TLR will
hold residencies Madrid but also in Tokyo and Osaka, introducing
European electro talent in Japan.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best strong bad email ever

I actually have two of those (well, parents own one).  We use them for 
our phone lists and mother's in the kitchen and uses it to store her 
recipes :)  Use mine mainly to interface with my media pc.  Right now I 
just made a few pages so that I can tell it to stream music from a few 
online stations.  Also have a weather page and couple other miniature 
things running on it.  Also have a 'screensaver' that's basically a 
webpage that refreshes and loads a new picture every minute.  Not all 
that good since the screens on those suck.  Although how he can type on 
a regular keyboard with boxing gloves is one thing, but typing on the 
mini-keyboard that comes with the audreys? damn.   man those keyboards 
suck.

the first rule of strongbad emails is:
do. not. ask. how. strong. bad. can. type. with. boxing. gloves.

Does anyone plan on rolling down south to Miami Florida for the World Music 
Conference?  I'm considering rolling down south this spring.  I was wondering 
who'd want to team up and go on a road trip.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best strong bad email ever

PROMPT $P$G

PROMPT $G

buttons got on a dos directory listing.

Subject: {pb-cle} "getting high is only human"

Brazil Abandon's 'Anti' Drug Crusade

Brazilian authorities announced this week they're to start treating drug use 
as
a public health problem rather than criminal matter, and are henceforth 
changing
the name off their 'National Anti-Drug Policy' to 'National Policy on 
Drugs.'

Under the new strategy, President Lula da Silva's government are to focus on
harm reduction policies, creating centres for safe drug use, leading 
newspaper
Folha de São Paulo reported this week

"Changing the name is a symbol, and there will be a change in orientation,"
government minister Pedro Gabriel Delgado told the newspaper. "The country 
is
maturing in order to put forward a more pragmatic policy."

Brazil's newly enlightened approach coincided with the publication of a 
report
into drug use by prestigious British magazine New Scientist this week, which
they headlined with the strap-line 'Getting high is only human'.

"Since prehistoric times, humans have been seeking out and using 
intoxicating
substances," the magazine pointed out, "most people who have ever lived have
experienced a chemically induced altered state of consciousness, and the 
same is
true of people alive today."

"We seek intoxication for a simple reason that we are almost too scared to
admit - we like it," they added, "intoxication can be fun, sociable, 
memorable,
therapeutic, even mind expanding."

Subject: {pb-cle} possible genetic link to god belief

I saw this posted on another list:

'God gene' discovered by scientist behind gay DNA theory
By Elizabeth Day
(Filed: 14/11/2004)

Religious belief is determined by a person's genetic make-up
according to a study by a leading scientist.


After comparing more than 2,000 DNA samples, an American molecular
geneticist has concluded that a person's capacity to believe in God
is linked to brain chemicals.

His findings were criticised last night by leading clerics, who
challenge the existence of a "god gene" and say that the research
undermines a fundamental tenet of faith - that spiritual
enlightenment is achieved through divine transformation rather than
the brain's electrical impulses.

Dr Dean Hamer, the director of the Gene Structure and Regulation
Unit at the National Cancer Institute in America, asked volunteers
226 questions in order to determine how spiritually connected they
felt to the universe. The higher their score, the greater a person's
ability to believe in a greater spiritual force and, Dr Hamer found,
the more likely they were to share the gene, VMAT2.

Studies on twins showed that those with this gene, a vesicular
monoamine transporter that regulates the flow of mood-altering
chemicals in the brain, were more likely to develop a spiritual
belief.

Growing up in a religious environment was said to have little effect
on belief. Dr Hamer, who in 1993 claimed to have identified a DNA
sequence linked to male homosexuality, said the existence of
the "god gene" explained why some people had more aptitude for
spirituality than others.

"Buddha, Mohammed and Jesus all shared a series of mystical
experiences or alterations in consciousness and thus probably
carried the gene," he said. "This means that the tendency to be
spiritual is part of genetic make-up. This is not a thing that is
strictly handed down from parents to children. It could skip a
generation - it's like intelligence."

His findings, published in a book, The God Gene: How Faith Is Hard-
Wired Into Our Genes, were greeted sceptically by many in the
religious establishment.

The Rev Dr John Polkinghorne, a fellow of the Royal Society and a
Canon Theologian at Liverpool Cathedral, said: "The idea of a god
gene goes against all my personal theological convictions. You can't
cut faith down to the lowest common denominator of genetic survival.
It shows the poverty of reductionist thinking."

The Rev Dr Walter Houston, the chaplain of Mansfield College,
Oxford, and a fellow in theology, said: "Religious belief is not
just related to a person's constitution; it's related to society,
tradition, character - everything's involved. Having a gene that
could do all that seems pretty unlikely to me."

Dr Hamer insisted, however, that his research was not antithetical
to a belief in God. He pointed out: "Religious believers can point
to the existence of god genes as one more sign of the creator's
ingenuity - a clever way to help humans acknowledge and embrace a
divine presence."

Subject: {pb-cle} Cuddle Parties Reach Central Ohio

A friend of mine mentioned cuddle parties to me about a month ago, and I
didn't really believe him. It sounds to me like the people doing these
have to be on some kind of drugs.. and I don't entirely believe there's
no sex involved.. Sounds kind of creepy to me. 
What are your thoughts on these? Have you heard of them??

Is it weird to think that this wouldn't be creepy if sex or drugs WERE
involved? :)

some entertaining/interesting/scary things i grabbed in the faq section of this site:

[u]What if something "comes up"? (AKA, Arousal and the Erection Phenomenon...)[/u] 

Erections. Erections. ERECTIONS. There, we said it. When men get aroused, they sometimes get erections. Arousal is an inherent part of being human. But somehow, somewhere, many of us began to believe that we must act on this arousal whenever it showed up, as if we may never have another chance to be horny again and we must strike while the iron is hot, so to speak. 

Well, this attitude has caused all sorts of weirdness in our society and massive miscommunications between the sexes. Since Cuddle Parties are safe spaces for adults to explore and practice affectionate touch without sexualizing it, and since the state of arousal is natural for us human beings, it's no surprise that erections sometimes do occur. Our goal is not to teach men how not to get erections. Instead, we want to make normal functions and needs of human beings seem, well, "normal." 

We strive not only to free people of the awkwardness surrounding arousal, but to allow them to develop some real coordination around it. At a Cuddle Party, erections become Mother Nature's way of giving us the thumbs-up sign. Nothing's wrong. Nothing's dirty. Nothing's suspect. And as long as you're not dry humping anyone (Rule #7), it's completely okay. Really. 

[u]Cuddle Lifeguard On Duty? What's that?[/u] 

Cuddle Lifeguards are a select group of amazing individuals who are specially trained and certified in how to facilitate Cuddle Parties and handle the situations and conversations that come up for those who attend Cuddle Party events. 

They are responsible for ensuring the integrity of the room, meaning that no sex happens, that everyone feels safe, and that the sexual energy, when it shows up, is dispersed safely. They, along with the Cuddle Caddy facilitate the Welcome Circle and make sure everyone gets taken care of. 

[u]What's the job of the Cuddle Caddy?[/u] 

Cuddle Caddies assist the Cuddle Lifeguards. Their job is to help out, by checking people in, answering questions and backing up the Lifeguard. They too are trained, but their training isn't as intense or long as the certification to become a Cuddle Lifeguard. Think of Cuddle Caddies as the flannel sidekicks of the Cuddle Party Dynamic Duo. 

[u]Can I get stoned at a Cuddle Party?[/u] 

Illegal drug use of any kind at a Cuddle Party is not cuddly. Cuddle Parties are safe spaces for adults to explore affectionate touch without sexualizing it, and without drug use. 

[u]What the heck is a Puppy Pile?[/u]

A Puppy Pile is when a bunch of people crawl atop one another and cozy up, like puppies do just before they fall asleep. Some of us recall similar moments as children piled on top of one another in front of the TV or scrambling for a King of the Mountain moment on a bunk bed with our friends and cousins.

Think of a rugby scrum but with everyone in pajamas, and no one biting anyone's ear.

For a really excellent description of a puppy pile, check out Nerve.com's article about us.

[u]Are you guys willing to sell out? [/u]

Our committment is to maintaining the integrity of Cuddle Parties as safe spaces for non-sexualized affectionate play. Provided that that committment is not compromised, Marcia and Reid are otherwise completely willing to sell themselves out, as long as it's to someone fun and makes us look even crazier and cooler than we already are! In particular, we would love to hear from Nutella, Apple Computers, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, and Bailey's Irish Cream, without all of which this operation would not have survived this far. Also, coffee. REiD loves his coffee (with Bailey's!)

come on down and get to know him. Listen for Deviant to drop some 
fresh choons from Grayarea, Lynx, Dousk, and G Pal.

As always, HeadRush guests enjoy a $10 draft and well open bar 
from 11:30-1. RSVP at our site, or find me at the party and I'll 
hook you up.

Yahp. Everyone have a fun and safe holiday. I'd hate to hear someone I know
died from chocking on a turkey leg. It's just not natural.

Nope, he's not gay (so he says).

I made a comment about his possible gayness on the dnb@breakbeat list a
few years back in the midst of a hardcore vs crap dnb discussion.  He
emailed me offlist (I didn't know he was subbed to the list; no one did
afaik).  He's not the brightest bulb on the tree, so to speak:

Haha, hi there mate! Seen all your millions of posts on the D&B arena list
â€“ good work, good to see you feel so strongly about all that stuff. Might
be a good idea to cut down on the posting though, looks like ppl are
getting a bit pissed off!!! haha.

Oh yeah, no Iâ€™m not gay either... where/when did u spin a the same party
as me? Iâ€™ll have to try and rememeber whattt waz going on.

To be honest I havent read much of your hardcore discussion stuff, and I
donâ€™t wanna get involved in it either â€“ but all I can say is I was never
involved in raves and stuff, I was too young, and I have hardly ever
listened to any old hardcore. For me d&b is about developing the genre and
introducing new ideas. Annnnnnnnnywayyyyyyyyyyy

My one?

Your one?

Who's one?


Did you mean "You're"?

I'm no 'spelling nazi', but if you're going to take the time out to  
attempt to attack someone's intelligence, at least spell the words  
correctly.


FWIW, I enjoy John B's music, and he's a very nice guy; I just don't find  
him to be too intelligent.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  So far all but one person
thinks this is a good idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Nov 27                      ANDY CALDWELL                     Cleveland

Saturday, November 27 _ Thanksgiving Weekend:

Andy Caldwell
(Om, Naked, Inspirit) San Francisco

Bay Area native Andy Caldwell had a passion for the art of music long
before the advent of electronica, and a decade before embarking on a
career in deejaying, producing and songwriting. But true musical
expression for Andy hit all new levels in the wake of San Francisco's
underground rave explosion, when the one-time concert trumpeter and
piano player subordinated his horn and foot-pedals in favor of two
turntables and a bag of vinyl.

Caldwell's first track "Superfunkidiculous" was released in 1994 and
quickly became a top hit throughout the club scene, leading to a
collaboration project with childhood friend Gabriel René. Forming the
highly acclaimed San Francisco band "Soulstice", Caldwell and René
produced and wrote music for the release of the band's album "Illusion"
and the renowned remix album, "Mixed Illusions." During that time,
Caldwell also created a steady stream of his own celebrated releases
for OM Records including three stand-alone, single releases, as well as
releases featured on Mark Farina's widely popular Mushroom Jazz series.

His singles were also included on six consecutive Om Lounge
compilations and two full-length mix CDs entitled Sounds of Om v. 2.
Caldwell's now seminal Om Records' release, "I Can't Wait" has appeared 
on numerous compilations and has become a house music standard.

Other top singles for Caldwell include his popular Naked Music releases 
"All I Need", "Lectropic" and "Give A Little" as well as remixes for 
Migs, Owusu and Greene and Arvid. He's also recorded and released 
"Pushin" and "Don't Hold Back" for Inspirit Music's InSoul Sessions v. 1 
and InHouse Perspectives 02, albums that he also mixed. He has also 
collaborated with DJ/producer Behrouz on their single "Be Free" and 
several remixes for the Yoshitoshi label, including the Grammy nominated 
track "Safe From Harm" by Narcotic Thrust, "Never Felt this Way" by Hani 
featured on Deep Dish's Toronto mix for Global Underground as well as a 
remix of UNO recordings first release "Too Late" by Mei-Lwun.

Further expanding his reach, Caldwell's signature production style is
also recognized in the film and television industries. He has composed
music for films such as Forces of Nature and Skulls, as well as popular
television series: Six Feet Under, Boston Public, and Chromium Blue.

At age 31, with an ever-expanding discography, Caldwell has only just
begun to fulfill his passion for music, with frequent DJ tours, remix
opportunities and production work. For the past 3 years, his DJ
schedule has allowed him to share his love of music with fans around
the world, playing records in every major city on every continent.

Support DJs TBA

Only $5.00!

Jason Lyman and Douglas Black present:

DEMARKUS LEWIS(Vista, Aesoteric, Freaked, Flat & Round) Dallas, TX

Demarkus Lewis has been heavily submerged in the world of dance music 
for the past fourteen years. He is currently one of House Music's 
hardest working artists and is in high demand around the World. 
Production is the main driving force behind his craft but he will tell 
you that there is nothing like a good crowd to beat down with great 
tunes.

As well D.j'ing, Demarkus finds time to hold down two weekly residencies 
at Dallas' prime time nightspots the Zubar (Fridays) and at The Pharmacy 
(Saturdays). He also co-founded Grin Music Artist Management with his 
wife, Kelly and currently work together booking both veteran house dj’s 
as well as up and coming favorites. In 2004, stepping up and moving 
forward seems to hold great rewards for him as he increases his 
knowledge and love of good music and continues on with many great new 
releases.

Fists in the air: Chaos reigns. For 8 years DJ Booth has dominated the

now holds so dear – an extensive play history of dates nationally and

to You" by Robbie Hardkiss of the famous Hardkiss brothers.

-Rob Riddum (Cleveland – J&N Media) Dnb/Hip-Hop turntablist
One of the key figures of the Element Squad returns to Cleveland. While

took home 3rd place at the Salt Lake City DMC. Come see this old skool 
turntablist wreck the decks.

Fri Dec 10                        JOHN DEBO                        Columbus

 ~~ Friday December 10th ~~

 ~~ Reticent Recordings ~~

 ~~ Global Nightclub ~~
 
 
 
 ~ Featuring...

    John Debo ~ SQ1 Recordkings, Bedrock, Yoshitoshi ~
   
    For John Debo, his first UK tour in 1992 (albeit a couch tour) 
developed into much more. Crashing on the couch of one Dave Seaman, one 
half of Brothers in Rhythm and A&R Director for the highly profiled 
Stress Records, John sat back and enjoyed the latest tunes from Dave and 
his label. As John happened to have a cassette of his new production 
work, he left it with Dave to enjoy. Days later John was offered a 
record deal for his Mindwarp project and proceeded to release new tunes 
on Stress. 
 
Founding two of Boston's pioneering club nights - Chrome & Avaland 
were conceived as conduits to bring forward thinking DJs and upfront 
dance music from around the world to Boston. His vision is global - not 
provincial. Chrome quickly garnered a reputation of being one of THE 
club nights in the US and Avaland was selected by Mixer Magazine as the 
#1 club in America for 2002.
 
The spell that he casts over dance floors has been felt worldwide with 
seminal gigs at Avalon in Boston & LA, Spundae in San Francisco & 
Chicago, Space in Miami, Aria & Stereo in Montreal, Koolhaus in Toronto 
as well as Bedrock & Renaissance in the UK and Space in Ibiza to name a 
few. His sound has been captured on two mix CDs released in 2001: Chrome 
01 on Bliss and Logic Trance 5 on Logic 3000.
 
Given the success of his debut material on Stress, it should be no 
surprise that John Debo has found a home for his other work. Remixes 
have been released on Bedrock & Yoshitoshi as well as an original 
collaboration 'Deported' with Steve Porter on Bedrock. Past production 
includes remixes for the likes of Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Blur, The 
Charlatans UK, Candyland, Pendulum and My Friend Sam featuring Viola 
Wills, Debo has managed to bring his touch to a quirky bunch of classic 
tunes.
 
John has recently left Boston and relocated to sunny Orlando Florida to 
focus on his true passion - the music. The move allows him to fully 
explore his artistic mind and immerse himself in writing, production and 
DJing. .
 

 ~ Also featuring...

    Reticent ~ www.reticentrecordings.com ~ Downtown Entertainment ~
 
    Reticent Recordings formed early as an idea in 1997. Then finally 
became a reality in 2003.  The main purpose of Reticent Recordings is to 
be unique, and unlike any other label. Reticent Recordings is about the 
music, plain and simple. Reticent plans to distribute quality sounds, 
feature up and coming artists, all with a strong focus on the art and 
talent of the artists. 
 
Reticent are two American producers originally from Dayton, Ohio now 
residing in Tampa, Florida.  Fredrick Gablemann and Drew Whitehead aka 
Guru were relative unknowns when first signed but their sound and grasp 
of production is truly exceptional. Fredrick's first release under his 
own name was huge and received massive top level support from names such 
as Sean Cusick, Lee Burridge, and Jimmy Van M.  With only three releases 
under their belts Reticent, has already been reviewed in Mixer, M8, and 
DJ Times. Their tracks have reached the play lists of such giants as 
Sasha, Danny Tenaglia, Steve Lawler, Danny Howells,  Anthony Pappa, and 
John Debo.

SCAN 7 : DETROIT, MICHIGAN
www.scan7.com : www.tresorberlin.de : www.undergroundresistance.com

In their first ever Philadelphia exhibition, Scan 7 is coming straight
out of Detroit with a hardware based "Live PA" and their own hypnotic
visuals. Remaining hidden behind their ninja-like appearances, these
anonymous heroes will provide a safe passage out of the sound slavery
of corporate programming.

The true identity of Scan 7 remains a mystery.  Always performing
masked -- a proof of their link with Detroit's powerhouse Underground
Resistance -- they believe it's important not who you see but what you
hear.  Their dark and funky dance floor music and incredible
imaginations have brought them to the most credible underground labels
in the world: Tresor, UR, SID, FCOM, Elypsia, and their own label,
Cratesavers.

Info:

Legowelt
    Legowelt = the name under which Danny Wolfers releases most of his
music. What Music you might ask??? Well a hybrid form of slam jack The
Hague electronix combined with deep chicago trax,obscure & romantic
ghetto technofunk, EuroHorror Soundtracks and lots -a- more! You can't
quite pigeonhole it but it sure as hell slams the pit!
    Already a few years in the business Legowelt has released a dozen or
so projects on various formats, most of them on good ol' vinyl released
on homebase Bunker records, The Hague's legendary pioneering electronic
music label. Sometimes these tracks spin out of the obscurity like an
asteroid from a spacebelt and fly straight into the charts; such an
event happened with 'Disco Rout' which was voted track of the year 2002
by the acclaimed german Groove magazine.
    Legowelt began producing music when in the early 90ies the
adolescent autistic schoolboy came in sporadic contact with the sounds
of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably
his all-time favorite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley
Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and mr.Fingers. Later on this palette of
influences grew with early Mu-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, various stuff
from The Irdial Discs label and virtually every type of freaked deep
music he could get his hands on.
    But nothing had quite the influence of when, somewhere in the early
90ies, he first heard a band called 'Unit Moebius' on the radio. A punky
palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi chicago trax and deep detroit jams made
with machines which were found next to the garbage can. Shocked in awe
he heard that this music came out of The Hague, Holland The very same
city he lived in! Put on the right track by this fact he stumbled into
the Bunker Records office and discoverd a world of contemporary autistic
freaked music lovers who looked beyond all the bland house and dance
music that ruled the media and clubs. Musical mentors such as IF and
Melvin White (aka pametex) lectured him with even more unknown sounds
such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco which
production secrets were closely studied. In 1998 Bunker released the
first vinyl of Legowelt : Pimpshifter, a 6 track mingled Italo Chicago
combi which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as 'Stumvogel'
and 'Total Pussy Control'.

Luke Eargoggle
    Deep, dark and slow, a black hole encroachment of your mind! Empty
cold pametex-style electro from the nordic territories, a sinister film
noir movie soundtrack, chillin'!

Orgue Electronique
    Orgue Electronique (Brian Chinetti) is the master of the staccato
minimal electro-nic sound with unexpected melodies and haunting tensions
in between beats. Orgue Electronique is not only known for the releases
he did on Bunker (the most searched cult-hit "The Eye That Never
Sleeps"), Stilleben (Arcadia full length album) and various
compilations, but also for his collaborations with Legowelt on Bunker
Records. Together they did several remixes, and later their
collaboration became better known as Macho Cat Garage, who did releases
on Viewlexx and Downlow and appeared on the DJ Hell mix CD on React.
Besides all this, Orgue Electronique has quite a reputation as a live
act, traveling all over the world: from the Hague to Detroit, from Tokyo
to New York, sharing the stage with many well known artists.

Catnip
    Catnip is the mysterious international team of producers bringing
you A1 classified raw electrodisco.

DJ TLR
    In the summer of love TLR started playing at punkparties in youth
homes that were later closed for asbestos threats. In 1996 he co-founded
Global Darkness and became involved in organising underground Jungle
parties in the totally freaked out and fucked up squat scene of the West
Coast of Holland area; filled with fundamentalists, attention junkies,
substance abusers, genetic experiments gone wrong and legions of crustie
tekno travellers like SP23 looking to escape the '94 Criminal Justice
Act and redefine noise pollution. In the late 90´s - when Jungle had
died a horrible death in Drum & Bass - he was swept away by the first
wave of The Hague electronics and the early works of I-F, Pametex and
Electronome when DJ Schmerlabor gave him some records at a Unit Moebius
gig. Their strange and exciting style was far removed from the mind
numbing lifetyle muzak that seemed to dominate the airwaves at the time
and refueled a love for electro in him that had been dormant since the
mid 80's. When introduced to the hidden treasures in the Clone
recordshop (that was then housed in a small and dark backroom of
Rotterdam´s Urban Unit) matters really got out of hand. TLR started
cultivating his newfound passion around ´98 when the bankrupt Bunker
label rose from its own ashes like a phoenix. Soon after the original
Global Darkness crew went separate ways. He made the Bunker Records
website and started Global Darkness, which silently grew into one of the
biggest and most active electro/disco communities on the Internet. In
2000 him and fellow dirty brown loser DJ Schmerzlabor (of Unit Moebius
fame) concocted the Bunker Records Dirty Brown World Tour and invited
Legowelt & Orgue Electronique (at that time one of the few Bunker live
acts) along to spread the dirty brown gospel. The Bunker Team was born
and he slowly rediscovered the early Freewave pirate radio Italo/disco
sounds of his childhood through the mixes of I-F and sunday afternoon
tea sessions in the luxurious mansions of Legowelt and Orgue
Electronique. And then the sky went open (insert trumpets here). It
didn't take long before the boys myth of grandeur became a reality, and
they've been touring ever since. The end of 2001 saw the birth of the
Crème Organization. What started out as a little playground for Mr
Clavio soon grew to more serious proportions with consecutive releases
of Lolita Strap, Bangkok Imoact and It & My Computer. Crème Organization
has been releasing on a rigorous schedule and quickly gained a cult
following. The following years shit got a little crazy for Crème and the
Bunker Team with several coast to coast US and Canadian tours, a bunch
Japanese tours and nonstop travel around Europe. In 2005 DJ TLR will
hold residencies Madrid but also in Tokyo and Osaka, introducing
European electro talent in Japan.

He's classically trained on the piano, has a degree in molecular biology,
makes some bomb-ass cutting edge music, and tours the globe playing it.

He's living the dream life and having a blast.  He uses hard work and his
talent to do whatever makes him happy.  And you're saying he's not
intelligent?

I must be on the wrong planet....

well, that was just hardcore.  Forgot you just said electronic music. 
Please forgive me if I forget some of these names.  I am only using 
first names unless needed to save on the typing, have to make sure that 
is clear.  Which, btw, for someone that only goes by 'DJ Entropy,' yo 
don't have much room to talk there.

in no particular order, people I know and have seen in the 'scene' this 
year.
Me
trout
bill
amanda
bj and steph
stephanie p (forgot how to spell your last name)
stephanie c
doug
andy james
moke
valerie
boompsie and umm, forget his name
luke
meghan and sid (I think)
alex
matt
nox
tracie
jdat
nicole
mark or mike, not sure I the m's mess me up
Soniq
Tom Cox
Nick S
Jea Leigh
Paul
Amy (ok, it's always at parties she's involved, so I GUESS you can slip 
this one by, kinda like how bush slipped in some votes for himself. 
Same idea, just backwards)
eric
marissa

That's everyone that a) I can come up with at 3:00am and b) that I 
personally know and talk to, to some extent or another.  Then lets not 
forget general parties.  Let's see, how many people were at movement 
this year?  how about wemf? or who's going to be at wmc?  Or how about 
going up to toronto to hear hardcore and jungle by local dj's (to them) 
and easily seeing a couple thousand people, with maybe 750 or so still 
there at 8:00 AM, screaming for more!!!

i guess that all depends on what year it is. if its 1997, then 
youre right he is making bomb ass cutting edge music. if its 2004, 
you must be smoking the same shit he is.

Fan last week for 10bucks and there were 400 people there, all ages, and  
down the street from my house.

...and yet a couple emails back you said no one listens to electronic 
music (assuming those bands are somewhere in the electronic genre, 
haven't actually heard of either of them)?  sure seem to be doing a lot 
of flip-flopping if you ask me.  You also conveniently left out the 
paragraph below that list, which said:

"That's everyone that a) I can come up with at 3:00am and b) that I 
personally know and talk to, to some extent or another.  Then lets not 
forget general parties.  Let's see, how many people were at movement 
this year?  how about wemf? or who's going to be at wmc?  Or how about 
going up to toronto to hear hardcore and jungle by local dj's (to them) 
and easily seeing a couple thousand people, with maybe 750 or so still 
there at 8:00 AM, screaming for more!!!"

Sure, I know some of the big ones are starting to become more and more 
comercialized, but these places are still getting 100's or 10's of 
thousands of people that attend them.

Um, no.  They are punk/pop-punk bands that have nothing to do with the 90s  
electronic music scene.

WTF? so now we're just talking about 90s electronic music?  Damn, why 
don't we talk about the electronic scene in salem, OH in 1991 from 
January to February.  MAN, not a single person in the scene.

I realized this a couple posts ago, but this is going nowhere.  I forgot 
the rule, "Arguing with DJ Entropy is like playing in the special 
olympics; even if you win, you are still a retard"

I'd be interested in that as well.

I've edited a bunch of video clips together... and burnt it so it =
repeats.

You could rent the Chris Andrews (and other directors stuff) at =
hollywood video and copy all that to one dvd as well :)

Subject: {pb-cle} tonight (Sat) in Cleveland


Saturday 11/27 - this week's MIX at abbasso

Serving on opening duties will be Cleveland's Dan Stark, playing 
breaks and house. Then Thomar is up, straight home from the Big 
Apple to share the latest cuts from the New York scene. Also in 
the mix will be Deviant; listen for fresh choons from Grayarea, 
Lynx, Dousk, and G Pal. Ask Dave for copies of his latest 
promo...it's dope. Probably my favorite of the year.

As always, HeadRush guests enjoy a $10 draft and well open bar 
from 11:30-1. RSVP at our site, or find me at the party and I'll 
hook you up.

abbasso (inside bottoms up)
1222 prospect ave, east of e9th st
downtown cleveland
216.566.7278

If you buy the pro version of g-force you can export to video.

i dont know the disc, but unless something is specifically placed in the 
public domain, it has a default copyright.  maybe it is in the pub 
domain?  *shrug*  or under those new creative commons licenses?

so what does that mean entropy? you swing by the nutz of the latest trend? 
I've recently been relistening to my aphex twin collection and I enjoy it.

Electronic music has been on a downtrend for about 4 years now.  Thats so 
long the news about it being dead is dead.  I guess you will be there for 
the uptick sayiing how much this (electronic) sound rocks.

The greatest thing to happen to electronic music is for the mainstream to 
leave it alone.  I guess for some people the important part isn't really the 
music its just being able to see and be seen.

nice bar, the bartenders need to get their heads outta their asses.  
seriously.

decent quality sound, but wasn't very loud most of the night.....

guess we'll  see where things go from here since moda fell off the map.

wrong.

the site is down right now:  http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/
but heres the google cache:  http://redirx.com/?g2um
some books on the subject:
http://synthtopia.com/recommended_sites/120YearsofElectronicMusic.html

they kinda leave off at 1990 on some of that.  *shrug*

electronic noise making gizmos have been around for a long time i'd say 
alot of experimenting was done in the 50s and 60s with it.   how 
successful it was i guess depends on your point of view on it.

i'm the proud author of the "hey alan" post. of course when i'm
actually talking about something worth talking about, no response.

i saw alan in his boxer shorts today ... no mention of john or b.
anyone want to continue discussing the shorts ?

:)

SRR: somewhat rave related

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} hey alan - john b says he's not gay

I love pissing contsts. Tonight for supper, I plan on roasting cornish
hens in a broken oven, which is damn hardcore when you're poor but refuse
to consume anything less than gourmet. Fortunately, my new job starts
tomorrow and soon I'll be able to afford bottled wine again (as opposed to
Franzia).

The merlot _isn't that bad_. One of the Christmas presents I want from my
mother-in-law is for us to make wine together at Buckeye Brewing, which is
cheap but good at the same time. But we need a new oven too, badly. I
started dropping hints about both the wine and the oven weeks ago -- we'll
see how good a listener she is. =)

My cornish hens are cooking in their white wine, garlic, lemon, & fresh
rosemary/sage/thyme sauce right now ... baby red potatoes and asaparagus
to follow. Yummy.

Call me a purist, but my favorites are French wines. Must be those
hundreds of years of history behind them. One kinda funny thing about
France not supporting the US in the war in Iraq was that French wine got a
lot cheaper. I felt bad for the French growers and vintners, since
politics fucked up their livelyhoods for a while.

Yeah, if i go again next year it will be my third time down in Miami 
for the conference. It's extremely addicting. I would recommend anyone to 
go down the week of the conference, insanely large amounts of all 
genre's as of music all day and all night. I drove my first year, I 
recommend flying though.

See ya there!

sure could use that tape deck for ripping my old mixtapes to mp3.   
guess that is if they didn't rust in the basement flood, i haven't 
checked out what kind of damage they might have had. 
and caffeinated hot sauce.  hahaha.   too much.

I'm much more fond of http://www.jinx.com/default.asp for t3h hackwear. 
Met one of the dudes here in CMH when they were travelling and I was

I've noticed on some boards lately that people have been using "TEH"
as some way of either making fun of people or just general stupidity
like other old skool bbs/hacker/irc typo/acronym nonsense.  Since
you're the first one on PBCLE as far as I know to say "t3h" can you
please explain how this one came about as I've been off IRC for a good
5-7 years now.  By came about I mean I understand the whole "the =
t3h/teh" as a typo thing but why on earth would people propagate it.

I don't think there's much sense in trying to figure out the logic
behind a typo or a stupid new writing style.

History of geek dislexia is unarchivable/researchable so dont try and
pin point the source of the " teh " :P

Interesting. Maybe I'll just come up with a new one, and those who get 
it and use it are much the wiser.

Subject: {pb-cle} recording software question

I'm looking for some windows software that will be able to record from 
two sources simultaneously.
Like if I have two soundcards in my PC then I wanna be able to record 
from the line-inputs on both of them at the same time. Is there 
something simple out there for this.

Yeah right... degraves has an auto .gif to ascii art converter on their site 
:)

I didn't do that... you had to be on AOL (version 2.5) like 10 years ago to 
understand.

It was all the rage to code a "AOHack" proggies on aol (similar to AoHell) 
that exploited AOL.   AoTurkey wasn't an "AOHack" program it simply scrolled 
a few ads for a program that didn't exist... and in the hands of a few key 
people... it was one of the "highest in demand" programs in the warez rooms 
but it never existed.  Kinda funny.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} recording software question

I dont think there is a multitrack program that uses 2 sound cards at one 
time.  I could be and am probably wrong but look at the asio drivers and I 
think they can only take hold of one card at a time.  So your best bet would 
be to record 2 mono inputs (L+R)

			The best way to accomplish getting audio from 2 seperate sources is to get a cheap mixer from radio shack.  I know your lookin for software, but you best bet without puttin 2 much money in is to possibly go that route.  Only thing about that is you would end up getting a single track from 2 sources, which would of course make it difficult to do any further mixing or effecting on either one.  Cakewalk Sonar excepts multiple sound cards, but your looking at blowin like 350$ on that.  Unless you go the pirates way.  If you use AIM, IM me at DJScythian.  I'll see what I can do (as the fbi crashes through my window and points m-16's at my head).  Nooo, it's not the full version guys. wink wink...nudge nudge
