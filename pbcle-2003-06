Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

What's messed up is that I know that I was in a few of those pictures from,
say, The Big Adventure and they are not currently displayed on the pb-cle
website.  Does someone in administration/photography/PR hate me?

I admitedly ducked out early, but I was AMAZED at the energy and skills that
John brought to the tables - you could tell it was going to be a great night
and I'm glad I made it down for the bit I was there.  That man seriously
rocked it and I feel privleged to have experienced at least a part of it.  I
hope you guys will bring him back to Cleveland again, it definately was a
treat!

Wow. Holy f+cking sh*t.

I want anyone who didn't make it last night or who didn't stay for the whole

missing it.

hmm...let me say that again...
OMG...
 
Fantastic night~! 
 
That club Sat. night had one of the best positive vibes I think I've ever felt down there. 
Truly a great start to the summer.  And it was wonderful to share it with some wonderful people!
 
(John is just awesome!!  Totally cool guy, completely what a DJ should be!)

I want anyone who didn't make it last night or who didn't stay for the whole thing to promptly take your hand and smack yourself upside the head for missing it.

John Howard is much, much, much more than a "San Francisco House DJ." He =
took us on a journey, and left the crowd standing with applause in an =
ovation of joy and gratitude. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE in the bar =
stopped what they were doing at a breakdown in a track to face the DJ =
booth and applaud. He brought movement to our feet, tears to our eyes, =
smiles to our faces, purpose to our friendship, and happiness to our =
lives. It has been a while since I've had one of those moments.

He is completely down-to-earth. Mingling with the crowd, taking time to =
dance on the floor during both Ian Shearson's and Deviant's sets. John =
said he had a great time and had a lot of fun. He said he loved the =
vibe, felt really relaxed, and thought that Abbasso was an absolutely =
beautiful place. It's incredibly refreshing to see someone who lives the =
old-school ideals of the scene in an age where many are lured by a "DJ's =
are gods and I am a DJ therefore I am god" mentality. The truly =
incredible thing is that after talking to him, hearing his music, and =
hearing his stories -- of anyone I've ever met, he probably has a right =
to have a more elitist attitude. But despite his longevity in the scene =
and his accomplishments, he keeps it real. He also demonstrated that =
being a good DJ is about pushing boundaries, and that no matter how long =
you've been doing it, it's good to continue to evolve. His recent move =
to New York City has had some musical influence on him, he said, and it =
showed. Anyone who was expecting a purely jazz house SanFran sound was =
surely surprised by the last hour and a half. Simply mind-blowing what =
he was able to weave together. The music and vibe was nothing =
reminiscent of a loungey "background music" taste; it was rich, intense, =
full, emotional, and inspiring.

It's been 2 years since I last saw him, and since then I haven't seen

John did lay down a great set. The best set I have seen at Abbasso yet.

If you like the OM label or SF house for that matter be sure to check

I admitedly ducked out early, but I was AMAZED at the energy and skills
that
John brought to the tables - you could tell it was going to be a great
night

rocked it and I feel privleged to have experienced at least a part of

here's a better idea, how about we have parents do their job and teach their

jump all over em... we wouldnt need government if people weren't inherently

Hey Guys,
This is from the Drug Policy Alliance

The Ohio House of Representatives recently passed its budget.  In this
budget, the House cut all state funding for Drug Abuse Resistance
Education (DARE).   The Drug Policy Alliance applauds this news.  Yet,
the Senate will pass its version of the budget tomorrow.  Please urge
your State Senators to concur in not reinstating funding for DARE by
calling (614) 466-4900 (you can find your Senator at
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=38717&l=1929 ).

As you know, Ohio currently faces a budget crisis.  Legislators are
fighting to find monies to fund essential social programs, education and
health care services.  Ohio spent more than seven million dollars during
the last two years on the DARE program, even though there is clear
evidence that DARE is a failure (for more info, including research
reports please see:
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=38717&l=1927 ).  Recent
studies by the General Accounting Office and the Research Triangle
Institute (sponsored by the U.S. Department of Justice) reported that
DARE had little or no long-term effects on its students' drug use.  By
spending millions of dollars on an ineffective program, the State loses
the opportunity to spend your tax dollars wisely by dedicating them
towards real drug education prevention programs that are less costly as
well as other social programs, education and health care services.

Please call (614) 466-4900 and urge the Ohio State Senate to follow the
lead of the House by denying future funding for the DARE program.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} DARE

I suspect that is "correlation without causation"

D.A.R.E. is a pretty recent thing. The war on drug is a pretty recent thing. 
Criminalizing more drugs allows many more "illegal" drugs to exist by 
definition. Those numbers feed into each other.

I don't like D.A.R.E. I am just making a point. Any program that encourages 
a child to report their parents for any suspicious activity - such as even 
suspecting that their parents smoke weed, although never needing to have 
seen it - is very problematic. Especially when this partially informed child 
is unaware that their report is likely to get them pulled out of their 
fairly stable homelife and thrown into a horrible foster care environment.

Its like the U.S.A.P.A.T.R.I.O.T. act for minors.

No, it is with causation ... these young kids end up learning all these exaggerated claims about the dangers of drugs and then, once they encouter say, weed, in 8th or 9th grade and see that it doesn't kill people - they assume it's all been lies. Next thing you know - they're hittin' the crack rock that they paid for by letting the dealer assfuck them... well maybe not that extreme ...

makes kids want to do drugs. Mental torment and low self esteem make

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} DARE

2 things i have to say about this:

1) any time any authority figure told me i wasn't
allowed to do, see, hear, or have something, it became
top priority. it was the first thing i did, the first
chance i got. i wanted to know for myself, i'm just
not one to take anybody's word on anything unchecked.
also i learned very early on that the "forbidden
fruit" is always the tastiest, sometimes just because
it is forbidden. 

2) the foremost and constantly underlying reason i
ever did drugs, especially in any excess, was BOREDOM.
i suppose there are a million reasons people do drugs,
but for me it's just that if you do drugs you can sit
around and do nothing and it's ok somehow, as long as
you're "fucked up." although sometimes certain drugs
make me want to do other things while on them, that is
relatively rare, and i usually decide just to sit
around in the end even then. 

i'm not every kid, or even probly most, but i'm not
alone i'm sure. i think kids do drugs these days
largely because they learn at an early age from
society in general that the way to get respect is by
being tough, and hard, and breaking rules. if you
don't, you're a "pussy," or a "mama's boy," etc. this
is especially true for boys. it's just not cool to not
party. and really, anything even a little wholesome is
just not exciting enough for todays kids. it's like
what your parents think is cool, which is exactly what
you don't want to do. 
 personally, if there is one idea that i would say led
to almost every bad decision i made as a kid/teenager
it was coolness. the idea of being "cool" is the worst
thing for kids when it becomes so important, even life
or death, and there were even kids in my schools who
killed themselves because of their suffering over
unpopularity. that should tell us something. maybe if
they had done drugs they would have been cool and
would have survived to see where they went wrong...who
knows.

well that's my 2 cents anyway, if it's even worth
that.

that's just part of the age old initiative to
encourage "tattletailing." the government's job gets
alot easier when they have us all watching each other
and an ratting each other out for a cookie. it aslo
creates diviison, suspicion, hatred, and fear amongst
people. you should read kingdom of fear by hunter
thompson. anyway, it's a tenet of the free market
system to try and get ahead by snaking the other guy.

that's because the government wants them too, they
want to raise the children, i don't suppose i have to
illustrate the motivations for wanting to do such a
thing. also the system in general wants people to feel
more and more helpless, so they'll beg for more
government intervention, that's incidently why they
lock up pot heads and let loose violent offenders, yet
they want to fry a couple of them every year as a
front. the more violent crime, the more fearful people
turn to the government. it's working too, so don't
expect it to stop any time soon.

there's a single word that can encompass all of those so that we
can be more effective in fighting them: life. 

i say we wage a war on life by encouraging people who dont like
their life to kill themselves. that will solve their problems for
good.

I think that Dare is so uneffective because all it is is a lame attempt at 
scare tactics.  Drugs are bad, M'kay?  By telling kids that everything will 
kill you and not telling them the facts,  they will quickly see through the 
ruse.

When I was in high school one of my friends was the dare officer's pot 
dealer.  They got high together all the time.  Hey, at least he was 
experienced!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DARE

Let me expound upon what I said a moment ago:

I'm not disagreeing with the majority of what you said. Especially about "kids on drugs turn into
adults on drugs"...

However, I DO take issue with this statment:
<<If there is any problem in the current system, it's the fact that 95% of teachers and school staff
members totally ignore the injustices students do to other students right in their classrooms and
halls.>>

I have family members and close friends who are teachers and faculty members, and I can speak for a
vast majority of the teachers I had in 13+ years of school, and BELIEVE ME....if they didn't care,
they wouldn't even BE in that building.

Being a teacher is not JUST a 9-5 job. It's a life choice. The baggage and emotional turmoil that I
see the teachers that I know bring home with them on a nightly basis would make half the people I
know look for a bridge to jump from...

To think that kids' home problems that walk into the classroom with them DON'T affect most of these
people is pretty far-fetched, I'd think.

Trying to talk to parents who are too wrapped up in themselves to worry about their kids affects
these people.
Trying to offer some sort of help for these kids whose parents are beating the shit out of them
affects these people.
Trying to convince shitty parents that IT IS THEIR PROBLEM....affects these people.

I also happen to have some first-hand knowledge of what a lot of these teachers make a year, and
trust me when I say that, given the amount of responsibility heaped upon these people from day 1
walking in the door and given the amount of their time, talent, energy and emotional input these
people invest in their jobs DAILY, the salaries are pathetic.

I understand that your example is from personal experience, and that personal experience was painful
and eye-opening, and I feel bad that that administrator you dealt with was worthless and
ineffective. But saying that 95% of all teachers/educators are guilty of indifference is just wrong.

Out of curiosity, after getting nowhere with your vice principal, why didn't you talk to your
parents about the problems you were having in school?? I understand that their reach would be
limited and that the vice principal would have been a more DIRECT, effective influence (had he
actually BEEN effective), but once that failed, why didn't you get your parents into the action??

it seems that the current thinking of the human
species at large is that we need to eliminate "bad"
things on the whole, and all our efforts are
concentrated on this. what is not realized is that you
can't have sobriety without drugs and booze, if you
get rid of one you get rid of the other. if you like
having a good time, you have to be ready to accept
having a bad time too, because it's precisely the bad
time that makes the good time good. you kill one you
kill the other. what we need to do is check things,
not try yo eliminate them. that is balance

According to this page (
http://www.jacksondailynews.net/media.htm ) the song
is a collaboration between Michael Jackson, Ja Rule,
and Ashanti and the song was written by Michael
Jackson and "Murder Inc." boss Irv Gotti in January
2003.  Strange song indeed.

<<you kill one you kill the other. what we need to do is check things, not try yo eliminate them.
that is balance>>

Unfortunately, you've just explained the EXACT ANTITHESIS of western culture.

The entire basis of western culture (capitalism, democratic government, etc.) hinges on the promise
made of GETTING RID of that which is undesireable in your life.

-Too Fat? Get rid of pounds by buying my diet pills.
-Too Poor? Elect me, I'll make you rich.
-Not getting any ass? Buy my [insert ANY product here] and women will fuck you.
-Don't like [insert X behavior]? Elect me and I'll make it ILLEGAL!

Those who believe in balance in the world are destined to be great spiritualists, but horrible
politicians in this hemisphere.

Agreed.  One thing I learned about boarding school is that most of the
class body used drugs simply because they wanted SOMETHING exciting to do.
 It's not that the school didn't provide stuff, but school dances aren't
really exciting.  And you can only watch so many movies every weekend.

you are correct. and this westernism is spreading. (of
courrse we are making SURE of that)

but, look on the bright side, what's the best way to
stop a fire? let it burn itself out of oxygen. sooner
or later the trend has to swing back this way. i just
hope the planet survives til then. and another thing,
culture start right here with you and me, with
individuals who are aware. people can take it or leave
it but sonner or later they may notice tha fact that i
have been sitting here, smiling like an idiot all
along. either way i enjoy the big dramatic show.

Speaking of Eddie Izzard, I watched a movie with him in it this weekend
called The Cat's Meow.  He plays Charlie Chaplain.  It was pretty good.

Your speaking in rhetorical circles.

Drugs are bad. For every 1 positive note there are 10,000 negative.
Doesn't matter what drug your talking about.

Drugs raise your level of expectation of what is fun. Once that bar is
raised everything beneath it becomes less enjoyable. Blah and boring.

All health reasons put aside that alone is reason enough not to want my
kids on drugs.

The governments approach is wrong and flawed and is a result of a nation
that was addicted to herion/oppium. The system is old, flawed, and the
government is afraid to admit there mistake and start over with a new
policy. The answer is not legalizing everything or <insert your favorite
drug> because <insert your favorite excuse for not sobering up>. The
solution is sever punishment for dealers, suppliers, chem. factories.
With good efficient rehab for the users. You can't lock up people for
being stupid. But you can try to help them.

Getting caught up in the "Them" , "The System", against you borderlines
paranoid delusions. If your felling this way and watching behind foil
covered windows for black helicopters I suggest you put the pipe down.

Now that being said No one. Not one single person has the right to tell
another adult what they can and cannot do with his/her body. But we
where not talking about adults we where talking about kids. See the
problem is kids and young punks think they are invincible. They get
caught up in the mess and then there lives are destroyed. I can not even
count the people I have seen get eaten up and spit out because they
convinced themselves that what they where doing was OK and was just over
hyped by the government to get more tax dollars.

Denial is a fuck.
Fuck clay pigeons.

2 Day 6 hours and 3 minutes since my last cigarette. These patches don't
work for shit. First they are impossible to keep lit and the smell is
awful. So excuse me if I come up snide.

PK
Disclaimer - "you" is used in the universal you. So no I am not talking
about you.

it seems that the current thinking of the human
species at large is that we need to eliminate "bad"
things on the whole, and all our efforts are
concentrated on this. what is not realized is that you
can't have sobriety without drugs and booze, if you
get rid of one you get rid of the other. if you like
having a good time, you have to be ready to accept
having a bad time too, because it's precisely the bad
time that makes the good time good. you kill one you
kill the other. what we need to do is check things,
not try yo eliminate them. that is balance

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DARE

Many, not all, but many of the teachers and administrators and school board 
members that I've had the chance to meet and work with over the past 10 
years have seemed to live in some unrealistic fantasy land.  They work in 
an environment where they are the 'smartest' (think about that... they are 
surrounded by people - students - who are less educated than they are) and 
they aren't challeged day to day as most of us are in other jobs.  They 
lose sight of reality and their own importance.  They are often 
arrogant.  They regularly think that no one, even outside the school 
setting, can compare to them.

I'm not saying anyone in Mark's family is like that.  I went to a private, 
catholic high school many years ago, and had some of the greatest teachers 
in the world.  Public school systems, in comparison, even 20 years ago, 
were a joke.

I'm also not saying that I'd want the job of being a grade school 
teacher.  I wouldn't want to put up with the problems there today.  If I 
were to ever have children, they would not attend a public school.  But I 
believe that teachers and administrators are a significant factor in the 
cause of the problems, including those of chemical use, by students.  Peer 
pressure is strong, but having a realistic, non-judgmental figure who 
really tries to gain the respect of the students and who respects them, is 
sorely lacking in much of today's educational system.

DARE is also a joke, in my opinion.  It has only been proven to reduce the 
incidence of tobacco use among students.  Tobacco.  A legal 'drug' which 
kills many more each year than any other chemical.  I suppose that's good, 
in a way.  But certainly not worth all of the money which is poured into 
such a program year after year after year.

Teach EVERYONE, not just 'kids', about the chemicals that are out 
there.  What they are.  What they do.  How they can harm you... and let 
them make educated decisions about what to do with their lives.  That's the 
view in the rest of the world... but here in the US, we legislate morality 
and common sense.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DARE

i'm gonna have to go ahead and disagree here.  drugs are a masque for life.
nowhere in there can you say that drugs are fun.  it's some illusion.  i
have way more real fun balls ass sober, and seek out those ways to have fun,
but at the same time i'm not giving up having a few codka martinis to masque
life for a couple hours a weekend.

Can you seriously tell me that doing some drug, like smoking weed or doing
some amphetamine is more fun than say, going to cedar point or even going on
a nature walk with friends?

your idea of fun is way skewed if you think that the more you can masque
your problems, the more fun you have.

Just poke around for Eddie Izzard under the comedy tours section or
something like that.  It says on there that there are two shows, but I had
only heard of the Oct. 14 performance.
In any case, we have second row seats.  I'm already hyperventilating about
it, and I have to wait until October.

ahh prime example from just today:

There is going to be a community garage sale here this weekend.  
Right now there are only 8 people that are going to do it, so it will 
cost around $3 each for the ads in a couple newspapers.  (Idiot 
parents/adults #1) the woman that's organizing this has heard that 
there are people that are going to be in it, but don't want to pay 
for the advertising costs.  Even though if more people said they 
would pay, the price per person would go down even further.  (Idiot 
parents/adults #2)  We are phase 2 of the development.  She put 
flyers in both our area and in the phase 1 area.  Not one person from 
phase 1 is going to be in it.  What's the reasoning behind this? that 
out of the 30 or so homes that NO ONE will be part of this?  Because 
they feel that us phase 2 people are snobby S.O.B.s because the 
houses in this area were more expensive.  OMG PEOPLE!!!  to me, if 
the second phase is more expensive, that means that houses in phase 1 
have gained value, that more people want to be here and supply and 
demend has increase the cost in this area.  Anyone that knows me will 
tell you that I'm far from being rich or snobby.  If I was from a 
rich family, my 60-something year old father wouldn't be working a 
full time job in cleveland (about 25 miles, one way).  And my mom, 
who's disabled and works a 4 hour a day/4 days a week for what use to 
be "play money."  Now has to work in order use that money to pay the 
now-increased house payment.  And I would be working at an actual job 
and be able to afford to move out.  Instead I am working at the same 
job with my mom because I can't get hired anywhere, even though my 
resume is at a handful of head hunters and another handful of job 
sites, which I check and apply for jobs regularly.  Nor would I be 
placing in applications at gas stations, restaurants, and fast-food 
joints when i just got an associate degree in information technology.

How so? The discussion may have gone off in a bit of a tangent, but everyone on this list (except you) said they have found the DARE program to be ineffective.

I assume you're only talking about drugs that are used for recreational purposes, since I don't think you would suggest that drugs taken for medical problems do more harm than good. Interestingly, right now I believe both MDMA and LSD are undergoing clinical trials to prove or disprove their effectiveness as medicine (for pain mangement and treatment of post traumative stress disorder). And marajuana has been proven to help many people suffering from chronic pain. Ibogane is an effective treatment for heroin addicts. And amphetamines are routinely given to our own soldiers to help them stay alert during times of war.

Has this been your personal experience? What a shame. I still love the things I enjoyed before I ever tried a mood-altering substance.

What does it mean to be "on drugs?" Does having a few beers on the weekends count as being "on drugs?" What about on Monday, after you've partaken in a weekend of moderate drinking or smoking a joint. Are you still "on drugs" then?

So, you're telling us that it's been a little over 2 days since you had your last nicotine fix? Did you start smoking as a teenager? What was your reason for starting, I wonder?

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} DARE

i appreciate your view. i simply want to state mine,
so you can critique it however you want. i'm not
trying to dnage minds, just give them food for
thought.

my view is different. to me, the word "bad" is just a
word. your brain gives it a meaning, and attaches that
meaning to whatever it wants. it has no inherent
existence. it's a menatal construct, and one which
people cling to with their life. in seeing something
as a problem, it then becomes a problem. drugs are
just chemicals, people make them bad or good, without
us, they aren't either. i won't say that they are
"bad," i will say only that for me they served a
purpose which they no longer can serve, and i've
stopped taking them. i don't think they've done me any
good or bad, the good or bad comes from me, and from
my interpretation of experiences allowed me by
altering my perception. attempts made to deny me these
chemicals, especially those apparently issued simply
arbitrarily, and without understanding, only made me
feel that they were a big deal, and so want to see for
myself what all the fuss was about. it's the age-old
outlaw mentality, and it's why (hate to use a cliche,
but) prohibition doesn't work. drugs aren't the
problem, the desire to do drugs and the motivations
therein are what should be looked at. through
understanding this we can keep it from being a
problem, by not making it a problem in the first
place. but i still remember that the only reason i
know that they are unnessecary is that i took them for
years. being wasted made me appreciate being sober.
and don't forget that success is often the result of
learning gained from mistakes, i think too many
parent's want to deny their children this essential
priveledge. instead of telling your children not to
make mistakes, tell them simply to to be aware of what
they do, so that when they make them they will benefit
from them. this is like teaching (sorry, another
cliche) them to fish rather than giving them fish.
anyway, i'm just re-itterating, we can agree to
disagree. this is my view, and i have no personal
stake in trying to make it yours.

school was absolute hell for me, it's the reason I'm f'd up now.  
Still remember going to the teacher to report one of the many 
incidents and they said "No one likes a tater-tail."  Or one time 
getting so aggravated that I just shouted stop it right in the middle 
of class and they teacher told me to be quiet or get a detention.  
Only a couple teachers actually understood that I was one of the 
people that got picked on a lot and tried to look out for me/actually 
listened when someone was bothering me.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} DARE

How so? The discussion may have gone off in a bit of a tangent, but
everyone on this list (except you) said they have found the DARE program
to be ineffective.  

---- Because he said sobriety couldn't exist without drugs etc. Read his
post it was very circular. Is it bad list behavior not to agree with
majority? For the record I did say that the government policy where bad
and inefficient. 

I assume you're only talking about drugs that are used for recreational
purposes, since I don't think you would suggest that drugs taken for
medical problems do more harm than good. Interestingly, right now I
believe both MDMA and LSD are undergoing clinical trials to prove or
disprove their effectiveness as medicine (for pain mangement and
treatment of post traumative stress disorder). And marajuana has been
proven to help many people suffering from chronic pain. Ibogane is an
effective treatment for heroin addicts. And amphetamines are routinely
given to our own soldiers to help them stay alert during times of war. 

---Yea because that is what we are talking about. Kids with chronic pain
and traumative stress disorder. My bad I wasn't even thinking about the
junior high junkies needing some weed to help them get by.

Has this been your personal experience? What a shame. I still love the
things I enjoyed before I ever tried a mood-altering substance. 
--- Your prospective is skewed. I didn't say that it made you dislike
the things you did before drugs. The fact that you find it necessary to
take mind altering drugs to improve on any expereance is a shame.
However as my post said I will assume you're an adult and defend your
freedom to do so. I didn't say that there where no positives just that
the negatives far out exceed them.

What does it mean to be "on drugs?" Does having a few beers on the
weekends count as being "on drugs?" What about on Monday, after you've
partaken in a weekend of moderate drinking or smoking a joint. Are you
still "on drugs" then?
---Yes. If you want to put it in black white terms. However we where
talking about kids. Not adults.

> 2 Day 6 hours and 3 minutes since my last cigarette. These patches

So, you're telling us that it's been a little over 2 days since you had
your last nicotine fix? Did you start smoking as a teenager? What was
your reason for starting, I wonder?
--Yep. It sucks to. Didn't believe all the hype when I was in junior
high. Saw everyone I know smoke. Thought I was invincible. I think I
covered all this :)Then poof. I have had a lot of vices that I have
fixed but this one is a bitch and illustrates my point.

man, fun is YOU. YOU are the fun. the only reason
external conditions are associated with it in any way
is because we are attached to the, we give them credit
and blame them for everything. some people can have
fun picking through garbage, some people have fun
killing and eating others; still other people have fun
taking kids to the zoo, president bush has fun just
being president. fun is fun is fun. it's always the
same fun. it doesn't change, only people's own idea of
what is to be attached to fun changes. drugs can be
fun, but so can anything else, and so can some other
things that are less toxic to the individual. that's
all.

right?

Subject: {pb-cle} photo albums

    i am in the process of trying to organize my
    images from the past 6 months.

    while i've been sorta good about getting my
    vacation images up, i've got who knows how
    many images i'd like to put on our site.

    does anyone have any recommendations
    for a good photo album? ideally it would resize
    the images for me and let me sort into catagories
    and sub-catagories..

    we have debian (i think) running on our server,
    so it would have to work on that.

    any help would be greatly appreciated.

    also, any links to photo albums from people here
    i can check out would be swell as well!
   
    jenn

So is Revolution going on this year again on July 3rd as usual?  Is this why
all this talent will already be in columbus?  Or is this event replacing a
void of Revolution?

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} photo albums

Gallery is great for people who have somewhat small, low res, images to
start with. If you've got a somewhat large collection of pictures of
decent resolution/size pictures, importing a few hundred pics into
gallery can temporarily (read hours) turn your web server into slag. 

Case in point: http://www.krad-elite.com. Put up a gallery for my
friend, the CPU usage was insane for hours, and it was not nice (pun
intended, I couldn't renice the process because it started with a new
PID for each image resize). These were an average of 2560x1920 images,
with some panoramas reaching up to 19MB in size.

If you've already got a decent collection organized into folders, and
don't want to lay waste to your server for a while, try something like
irfanview (http://www.irfanview.com, it's a freebie). It'll make
thumbnail pages, etc, plus it can do all sorts of batch conversions just
not possible with gallery (which is just a gallery app, so that's a
given). It's got a lot of features, and is comparable to an expensive
program like debabelizer. 

So, my suggestion to ye, is to make a copy of your folders, and make one
for the site, and one for your archival purposes. Download irfanview and
the plugin pack (important!). Resize and optimize the JPG's for the
site, then bring up irfanview in thumbnail mode. Export the galleries
and you're set. Find a good CSS style, and you've got yourself a
pro-looking site. 

Don't get me wrong, Gallery is a great program, I use it myself. There
can just be a lot of reasons why one would rather do the optimizing,
thumbnailing, etc., not on the server -- especially if you're dealing
with importing a large gallery or set of galleries at once. 

- Mike

im just saying, if you put anything in your body regularly enough,
its going to end up being bad for you. it might not be able to be
detected easily, but im sure something counter productive is going
on. there's a price to pay for anything that is fun. i just dont
really buy anything that tells me that a drug is going to make me
addicted and kill me if i try it once or anything that tells me
that there are no side effects.

yes, like dihydrogen monoxide (street name "W" - check the W faq), its

If you're doing MDMA too often there's a lot more going (and affecting your body) than just the effects of the drug on the brain. You also have to account for sleep deprivation, malnutrition, and over-exertion. YMMV

 our government manipulates researh data to lend

would ultimately lead to its obsolescence and

Taken from a medical journal......



Long Term Ecstasy Users Don't Have Brain Damage 

Government backed scientists in Germany published new research this
week, which failed to find any significant or lasting harm to the brains
of heavy ecstasy users.

While the study of past and present heavy users (who averaged 827 and
793 pills respectively) uncovered tiny differences in SERT densities
(relating to potential seratonin damage) between current and non-users,
the differences disappeared altogether when former heavy users were
compared to non users.

"These results were particularly interesting in that they dramatically
contradict an American study done by George Ricuarte (funded by the US
government) which used similar brain scan techniques and ecstasy users
with a similar level of lifetime use, but which claimed to have found
massive (as much as 90%) loss of SERT," said an editorial in the hugely
prestigious Journal of Nuclear Medicine.

"This huge discrepancy is both unexplained and troubling, as Ricuarte's
claims were used both to justify outlawing ecstasy in the US and as
justification for sentencing increases," the journal added. The
authorities' favorite scientist was heavily criticized last autumn over
experiments he conducted involving injecting mice with MDMA, which other
experts branded 'the latest in a string of biased studies sponsored by
the federal government (Washington Post)'.

"Much of the NIDA-promoted (federally funded) research record . . .
suffers from serious flaws in methodological design, questionable
manipulation of data, and misleading and deceptive reporting in the
professional literature and to the media," said Charles Grob, a
neuropsychiatrist from the University of California.

(more than likely to Bloomfield area, I've got a solid lead on a bigger =
apt that is practically nothing per month for rent), but still =
entertaining offers from people that want to move me, my furniture, dj =
equipment, and my big screen TV into their humble abode for comradery =
(this means all you cracka ass crackas that like being entertained =

Cook Da Goose III.  I have no fucking clue.  None.  About a venue.  I =
know we have plenty of people wanting to come, and plenty of people =
wanting to volunteer food/money/dj appearances, but no venue.  Any help =
in this arena would be appreciated as I really wanted the party to be an =
outdoor gig with odd hours (ie: 3pm-1am) then camping as not to piss off =
any locals wherever the event is held.  I'm even thinking about checking =
out this place in Ashtabula County that I remember going to a bunch of =
wedding receptions and shit at growing up, and it offers the ability to =
keep sound in the main room (which for a party would easily accomodate =
400-500 people), but for the life of me i cant remember how close the =
nearest neighbors were, which I will check out the next time I go =
home...which should be soon...I figure that puts drive time at 1-1.5 =
hours from cleveland, 2 hours from pittsburgh, 2.5-3 from columbus, and =
4-4.5 from dayton/cincy... but I am still looking in the columbus area =

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Start tha puddle


I don't know but down here in lexington, kentucky there aren't that many 
e-puddles at ALL anymore.  But then again we do have a party ever now and 
again so when its time to throw down people are always willing.  But I guess 
a few stupid arses ruined the lexington scene for itself and thus it died in 
a bitter tragedy.  And when I went to detroit for DEMF that was my first 
time getting out of the house to go somewhere in AGES so I mean I didn't 
notice the crazy amount of e-puddles anywhere in detroit.  Everyone was 
dancing and having a glorious time.  It was awesome.  It re-invigorated my 
faith in people and their love for electronic music.. and it probably won't 
be a while till I go to another event.  Driving at least 2 to 3 hours just 
to party is EXPENSIVE so I will just rock out in my parents bedroom for the 
time being.  Would be nice to have a local scene to support again but oh 
well...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Cook Da Goose III and NRR: Pittsburgh

not to be off topic, but Bloomfield is a nice area.
I was actually looking around the same place.

I really hope CDG will be able to kick off this year.
Is it possible that Field Day and CDG could combine?

Seems like half the people from the list are playing, so I
cant see why the rest of the gang wouldn't go. =)

Just a thought.

For those of you interested, I've all but locked up the one job that I was
talking about taking and moving to the 'burgh (well, I'm moving regardless,
and all I have to do is some stupid formal interview so they follow
'procedure').  I'm looking very much forward to the move and being more into
what is happening, with all the club nights there that I've salivated over
for a couple years now and all.  I should be there moved in like mid to late
July, with the off chance of early August (more than likely to Bloomfield
area, I've got a solid lead on a bigger apt that is practically nothing per
month for rent), but still entertaining offers from people that want to move
me, my furniture, dj equipment, and my big screen TV into their humble abode
for comradery (this means all you cracka ass crackas that like being
entertained during my waking hours).

Cook Da Goose III.  I have no fucking clue.  None.  About a venue.  I know
we have plenty of people wanting to come, and plenty of people wanting to
volunteer food/money/dj appearances, but no venue.  Any help in this arena
would be appreciated as I really wanted the party to be an outdoor gig with
odd hours (ie: 3pm-1am) then camping as not to piss off any locals wherever
the event is held.  I'm even thinking about checking out this place in
Ashtabula County that I remember going to a bunch of wedding receptions and
shit at growing up, and it offers the ability to keep sound in the main room
(which for a party would easily accomodate 400-500 people), but for the life
of me i cant remember how close the nearest neighbors were, which I will
check out the next time I go home...which should be soon...I figure that
puts drive time at 1-1.5 hours from cleveland, 2 hours from pittsburgh,
2.5-3 from columbus, and 4-4.5 from dayton/cincy... but I am still looking
in the columbus area as well, just not having any luck in the mid range
venues that we could cook out at/camp at...

Well I'd be down to help in any possible way to combining both events if it
really had to come down to it. It'd seem like a pbcle pig roast.

anyone else up for the idea?

I like the idea of trying to raise some $ from Field Day by setting up 
a CDG fundraiser tent.  Side bar:  Goose, if you need help checking out 
the venue in Ashtabula let me know where it is and I'll find out the 
details.  Otherwise, ppl - we need to find a venue-!!  I still would 
like to have the events be separate, but I do understand if that is not 
possible.  I      -suppose- I could deal with having them together, it 
would be convenient and practical, but who am I to say anyways ;o) ?  
Btw, when is Field Day suppose to happen? Don't need an exact date, 
just whereabouts in the summer plans (late, mid, early)?

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Jun 14                          SE7EN                           NE Ohio

On Saturday, June 14th, 2003 Unified Entertainment, Wishing Well, and 
Phareal Productions bring you up to Northeast Ohio again for.........

"SE7EN"

Pride, Anger, Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, and Lust.

These are the things that come between people in general, promoters, 
cities, and different scenes that end up destroying it if it isn't fixed. 
This event will feature djs from all over and the main theme is for us to 
look at what we do every day that might hurt our scene and work on 
changing it. We think that if we can all throw away the bickering and the 
arguing this area of Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Dayton, 
Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Indianapolis, Nashville, and any other 
cities that are involved in our scene every week will be the talk 
everywhere as the places to be or just the Midwest in general.

Sat Jun 14                     SOMETHING TO DO                   Pittsburgh

Something To Do

Tired of saying there is nothing to do? Tired of the same ol' same ol' 
rave atmosphere? Tired of Mc Donalds trying to come up with something new 
and innovative but all they come up with is the Mc Bratwurst? Well thats 
too bad...sucks to be you.

But we are having an event that is an effort to re-establish the 
pittsburgh scene by giving you "Something To Do". This will not be the 
typical rave, this wont be the typical club, and this wont be the typical 
not rave/not club. What we are trying to do is make this a bi-weekly event 
in which we bring in DJ's and or bands that YOU want to hear and that we 
can afford...not what these promoters think you want to hear. As well as 
bringing in what you want to hear, we also throw some new faces into the 
mix. I mean lets face it, it seems that every flyer you look at has the 
same DJ's, the same tag team specials and the same venues all of the time. 
Time for a change. Depending on the turn out of this first event, we will 
have an event where we bring the variety stylee every other saturday. Some 
of the things to do so far will be as follows:

Random Stuff FREE Raffles

Video Games

Answer a Trivia Question at the door and get $1 off (30 second time limit)

Vote for your favorite DJ of the night

Vote for local bands or djs that you would like to see at our event.

Vote for genres you would like to see more of at our event

Vote for the new president of Guam

Mainly we just want to hear your opinion, and give you something to do in 
this seemingly boring town.


The confirmed Dj's are as follows:

Cutups [Ragga] - Crazy ass ragga shit.

2rip [Not Trance] - Commin in with a suprise non trancey stylee

B Rivers [Hardcore] - Not that happy crap your mom gives you.

the up and comming big wigs.

E-ditty w/Mc Ja bless[DnB] - Thats right!! Ja bless comming the whole way 
from Flordia to rock it for you katz.

Dire Code [Screamo Hardcore Band]- Bringing the change up to the typical 
rave atmosphere, be sure to check them out.

Darkbert (Steel City Hardcore) [Experimental Thrashcore]- Bringing the 
craziness with a blend of noise and weird shit you've never heard before.

Price: $5 CHEAPER THAN 6.99!!!!!

Support us...we arent here to bank off of you, we are here to make things 
better for you. We do this for the people, not ourselves.

headrushmusic presents

:: saturday, june 28 ::
:: part three of the summer series 2003 ::

JERRY BONHAM  (bedrock, renaissance, saw, spundae, san francisco)

Jerry Bonham, a pioneer in progressive, has been doing what he does best
for almost three decades. Jerry is a living legend - one of the true
beacons of electronic dance music.

Born in North Dakota, Jerry Bonham grew up listening to pop music from the
'70's, everything ranging from Barry White, and Sly to the Family Stone.  
In 1976 at the height of the Disco Era, Jerry ventured into Minneapolis,
where he began his DJing career. Later, Michael Graber, a Chicago DJ,
introduced Jerry to the infinite possibilities of mixing and live
composition, guided him away from simply being a mobile DJ. Instead of
playing only the hits like many fellow jockeys of that time, Jerry favored
the less-obvious works.

In 1988, he relocated from Minneapolis to San Francisco, where he became
engrossed in its local scene and fell in love with the people, the music
and the city. In early 1996, Jerry started his residency at San Fran's
super club Spundae/Nikita at 1015 Folsom. As the partnership grew, he
became co-owner of the Spundae Reckords Store located on Haight Street.

Jerry Bonham's DJing career on the dance floor skyrocketed during the late
'90's, his production standards paralleled the rise, hit after hit. In
1998, Jerry's first mix CD, "Interpretations," was released on Spundae
Recordings, followed by his celebrated 1999 release "Tranceglobalnation 3"
on Arcade America, one of Europe's most respected and influential
electronic dance music labels. "Interpretations II" is Jerry's latest mix
compilation released on Mute and Spundae Recordings. The CD was an instant
hit with 20,000 pre-sold copies.

In the recording studio, Jerry forged on to refine his progressive sound,
recording a remix of Expansion's "Listen" for the Texas based Funked-Up
Label. He is also part of the JSJ collective, also known as Jondi, Spesh,
and Jerry Bonham. Together, they recorded "Deep Love 9" and "Ghost of You"
on Renaissance; both tracks became the must-haves in a DJ's crate - two
absolute floor-fillers. In early 2001 Jerry recorded the single "Erendira"
(Spanish for "joy") with Planetary Consciousness on Bedrock. His recent
studio work is the solo track called "Seventh Seal", a 12-minute long
journey that opens with beautiful tunes and stripped drums, eventually
evolving into a complex web of progressive sounds and melodies.

John Digweed noted Jerry as a "world-class DJ", who "has been one of the
main pioneers of the progressive sound on the West Coast since the very
start, forever championing the latest sounds and pushing the music
forward." Dave Ralph added that Jerry is "the most underrated DJ in
America, who has real talent and depth."

Jerry Bonham has helped to define America's electronic dance music
movement with his flawless performances, and extraordinary production
skills.  Forever influencing the music, Jerry Bonham continues to love the
music as passionately as he lives and creates it.

Thu Jul 03                         KABOOM                            Canton

Universal Groove & Pipeline Productions present...

Kaboom!
A 4th of July weekend kickoff!!!

Featuring...

DJ Assault:
Jefferson Ave. / Fused
Ghetto Tech - Detroit, MI / Atlanta, GA

Born and raised in Detroit, Craig came to dance music like many of his 
Motown brethren, via the radio. Detroit radio jocks like the Electrifying 
Mojo, The Wizard (Jeff Mills' alter ego) and Chicago's Hotmix Five all 
made lasting impressions on the young artist. Mixing records since 1982, 
Craig has been indoctrinating people with his own take on electronic and 
dance music, which is very much an amalgam of his radio predecessors. From 
the Mojo's funky eclecticism to Mills' introduction of scratching to 
non-Hip Hop genres of music, his style is something that could only have 
come from Detroit. Along the way, DJ Assault was born. Anything is game 
when Assault DJs, be it house, techno, jungle, R & B or whatever -- as 
long as booties are bouncing. He has rocked parties around the world, 
including sets in Germany, Holland, France, Spain and throughout North 
America. Each time it's the same: When he steps up to the decks and 
unleashes that high-speed booty-shake, the audience has only one option -- 
to shut up and dance.


Annalyze:
Skyehigh / Stanton / Fused
Breaks/2-Step - Rochester, NY

Rochester NY's leading lady of 2-Step, Annalyze has been regularly rocking 
the Upstate, New York rave/club scene for close to three years. During her 
DJ set's, Anna combines an energetic stage presence with the hottest 
tracks in the 2-Step genre and the occasional break-beat track, as well as 
a bit of DMC scratching and turntable trickery, creating a vibe that keeps 
the dance floor packed and moving all night long. Having established a 
reputation as a constant crowd pleaser, Anna can often be found stepping 
away from the turntables, and joining the crowd on the dance floor during 
one of her legendary DJ sets.


Snyper feat. MC Enda:
GSP / Science Funktion / Subtech Audio / 4-Score / Still Vapor / Pipeline 
AM
Drum & Bass - Atlanta, GA

Snyper has been a native to the Atlanta underground for quite some time. 
In the mid nineties, spinning under various aliases such as "Jinx" and 
"Furious Stylz", Snyper aka Scott Thomas developed his skills spinning at 
various spots in the early Atlanta EDM scene. In early '99, teaming up 
with the notorious jungle dj Kysa, to form Link Productions, the duo set 
new standards in the stateside breakbeat hardcore scene, dropping 
mind-blowing tag sets all over the southeast that would go back and forth 
from drum n' bass to breakz with no apparent seam, hence bridging the 
"Link" between the two genres. By the year 2000, the drum n' bass 
influence took over and became Snyper's passion and main focus of 
exploration. In 2000, Snyper founded "Science Funktion Recordings", which 
became a collective label of extremely talented, up and coming dj's, 
producers, and emcees who ripped up the local/national scene with a wide 
array of styles including drum n' bass, breakbeat, house, hip hop, garage, 
electro, hardcore, trance, progressive, and everything in between. At this 
point in his career, Snypers style began to include elements not seen or 
heard thus far...fusing high energy, driving neurofunk sound with the 
darker, rolling, more abstract techstep feel, with scratching and

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Jedi Night
July 19th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring Djs:

Josh the Funky 1 - Chicago, IL - House - Funktion Recordings , IHR, Kid
Dynamite Recordings

Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, and
breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks.

In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In
the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at the
Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.

Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh
has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , "Bangin the
Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

As if his DJ'ing accomplishments weren't enough, Josh has also had his
hand in the studio producing tracks for the infamous Chicago labels I.H.R,
Kid Dynamite, and Strictly Hype Recordings. His tracks have been featured
on mix compilations and DJ play-lists throughout the world, further
establishing his reputation as a DJ/Producer. Josh has also lent a hand in
remixing for Chicago's number one house diva, Dajae. Her first single on
Kid Dynamite records entitled "Time" is an uplifting vocal anthem that has
received Billboard attention and has since been licensed to Credence
records in U.K. Most Recently Josh has re-mixed Dajae's newest single
"Everyday", also on Kid Dynamite records and already licensed to Defected
Records U.K.

Not one to be content with only producing records for other labels. In
2001 "The Funky 1" launched his own record label, Funktion Recordings. The
first release "Everybody Everywhere" by BSJ and Fun-K has found its way
into the record boxes of DJ's worldwide.

2003 shows no signs of slowing down as producers such as Santos Scanty,
and Jelo continue to churn out dancefloor stormers for his label. When not
in the studio or running the label, Josh is constantly touring the world
bringing his sound and skills together for the masses.

E-Sassin - Los Angeles, CA - DnB - Sound Sphere Recordings, Phunkatek
Recordings, Just Two

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran of the
Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical journey in the
late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and jazz/fusion bands which
helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. After a short stint in
the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to the electronic dance
scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. "Once I started getting
into producing dance music, I finally felt I was on the right track to
where I wanted to be musically. My reputation as a cutting edge producer,
and later as a DJ, steadily grew, and so did the work.

In 1992 E-Sassin produced and self-released a techno album which got the
attention of Sunshine Records. They approached E-Sassin to work with the
groups L.A. Rave and The Movement. At this time The Movement's single,
"Jump Everybody Jump" was charting on Billboard's Hot 100 so for a year
and a half E-Sassin was touring with The Movement all over the world.
"During that time I was exposed to many different music scenes and
cultures. That's when I was first exposed to jungle. Jungle at that time
had just broken away from the breakbeat hardcore scene and what really
hooked me on the music was the way it combined the different styles of
music together with a more forward thinking use of technology. The intense
drum programming and the tweeking of sounds pushed the boundaries of the
available technology, which to me made it possible for new technology and
programming techniques to be created just to keep up with the demand.
That's progressive music by any definition" By 1996, E-Sassin had made the
transition into producing only drum and bass. "Even in '96 drum and bass
wasn't too widely accepted in the States and very few domestic labels were
releasing any of it, so I decided to start up my own label".

Sound Sphere Recordings came to light and the first two releases received
so much positive feedback, it quickly established a high level of
credibility for the label and for E-Sassin's productions. Subsequent
releases have continued to elevate Sound Sphere Recordings, which has
gained the label well earned respect from both American and European
artists. Sound Sphere Recordings is one of the pioneering West Coast
labels to be dedicated exclusively to drum and bass and continues to be a
leader in superior quality domestic pressings and high profile releases.
Currently, E-Sassin is producing and re-mixing tracks to be released on
Sound Sphere Recordings and other prospective labels. Recent works include
re-mixes of Tha Truth's, "Red Lights", which is featured on the mixed CD
"Urban Jungle", for Priority Records, UFO!'s, "Enemy Infiltration" from
Thermal Recordings forthcoming on Sound Sphere, and 60 Channels' "Give Me
Your Love" for World Domination Recordings. He is also a featured artist
on the much respected album, "The World of Drum & Bass" on Formation
Records, which showcases some of the best talent from around the world.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)

The time is 1200 hours the date is 10/18/03 and the location is Pittsburgh 
PA.  The company that brought you a revolutionary event is now back to 
bring you the much-anticipated sequel to a phenomenon that began 1 year 
ago.  We gave much thought about how we could improve our event from last 
year and we decided to eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes 
brutal outdoors so we moved the legacy that started it all indoors into a 
beautiful large facility located in the heart of the steel city. We wanted 
to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of kind 
superstar import car event.  Even though we wont be racing vehicles this 
year there will be tons of fun, and many different creative things going 
on.  I will have to keep you in suspense about most of the activities that 
we have planned until the time is right but I will give you brief taste of 
what is in store for SO2.  Picture an event like you have never witnessed 
before lights, visuals, sound, lasers, dancers, djs, mcs, models, free 
stuff, contests, entertainers, many different automobile divisions, tons 
of cash prizes, a outdoor portion and indoor portion, and much more TBA!  
If you thought that Street Outlawz was as good as gets you wont believe 
your eyes when SO2 hits the city. So prepare yourself for an event that 
will once again go down into the history of the Steel City!

(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
his outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its not 
magazines then its live TV the Freaky Flow combination has truly been 
just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!




UFO! (Drum N Bass)
(Phracktel/ Phunckateck/ Phylum Recordings-SF)

The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!  Please dont be alarmed by 
the name the aliens are not really coming.  However this is just one more 
incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he his mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that 
whenever he drops his dubs the dance floor will be screaming for more.  If 
you hadnt had the chance to see this west coast legend then allow 
yourself the time to hit the dance floor at SO2 for an unforgettable 
musical experience!

the one the only DJ Cheshire! Chris a.k.a Cheshire is a one of kind 
performer his smooth intellectual attitude gives his style a unique 
separation that blows up dance floors every time he hits the stage.  The

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Cook Da Goose III and NRR: Pittsburgh

I think CDG3 should be seperate...I mean, I had a blast at Field Day last
year and a lot of the people I did hang out with were Pb-Cle Folk, but a
lot were not.  I like that CDG3 is seperate, because it's more akin to a
house party, it's basically invite only, and the people who come are
generally respectable, intelligent people (save for may a certain schizo
we know).  I like having one party that's just us, and i certainly
wouldn't want to make Field Day that.

Either way is fine with me.  It would be nice to have a seperate event just 
for the pb-cle list.  I'm sure everyone would be able to interact much 
better with out a thousand people there who no one is really familiar with.

let me just say, at the first white trash wrestling i went to in
east troy WI, franjo (the crazy ass croatian guy who tried
fighting that bull seal guy at our summer 00 event at the ice rink
in the south side)'s dad roasted probably the best pig ive ever
eaten in my life. by the time it was done, we were all pretty
drunk off jim beam and beer and the smell was just making us
salivate. pig roasts are always cool.

or putting up posters of a pig. really though, fuck some crackers.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re:{pb-cle} Start tha puddle

Just as much as you can question any federally funded medical research here 
in the US.
You can also easily question any research done in a foreign Country.
By the way doesn't most of that shit get made from around that area?
Anyway,
Considering that this country is the leader in almost all aspects of medical 
research, I'm willing to trust a US scientist over some crack pot in Germany 
who's probably on the shit anyway.
Like Tom said, just about anything you put in your body is going to have 
some kind of adverse effect.
Im still suffering from all the shit I use to do, so I don't know if I would 
buy into that shit so quickly either.
It was only recently did they change they're view and stop saying the shit 
wasn't addictive.
A good rule of thumb is:
You can't always believe what you dig up off the internet.

Taken from a medical journal......

Long Term Ecstasy Users Don't Have Brain Damage

Government backed scientists in Germany published new research this week,
which failed to find any significant or lasting harm to the brains of heavy
ecstasy users.

While the study of past and present heavy users (who averaged 827 and 793
pills respectively) uncovered tiny differences in SERT densities (relating
to potential seratonin damage) between current and non-users, the
differences disappeared altogether when former heavy users were compared to
non users.

"These results were particularly interesting in that they dramatically
contradict an American study done by George Ricuarte (funded by the US
government) which used similar brain scan techniques and ecstasy users with
a similar level of lifetime use, but which claimed to have found massive (as
much as 90%) loss of SERT," said an editorial in the hugely prestigious
Journal of Nuclear Medicine.

"This huge discrepancy is both unexplained and troubling, as Ricuarte's
claims were used both to justify outlawing ecstasy in the US and as
justification for sentencing increases," the journal added. The authorities'
favorite scientist was heavily criticized last autumn over experiments he
conducted involving injecting mice with MDMA, which other experts branded
'the latest in a string of biased studies sponsored by the federal
government (Washington Post)'.

"Much of the NIDA-promoted (federally funded) research record . . . suffers
from serious flaws in methodological design, questionable manipulation of
data, and misleading and deceptive reporting in the professional literature
and to the media," said Charles Grob, a neuropsychiatrist from the
University of California.

that all depends on who is funding said research. doctors are
definitely able to be bought, unfortunately.

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight@Havana - KING KOOBA

THURSDAYS @ HAVANA
Tonight 06.05.03

[DC SPACE] - 9pm - Brother Mike dishes out the deepness.

[BEDLAM] - 10pm - This will be Josh's last time playing at Havana before he 
moves it on to Cali.  Tonight he's playing some Funky Tech House and he'll 
be doing that on the FINAL SCRATCH.

[KING KOOBA] - 11:30pm - All the way out from San Fran - this was sort of a 
last minute deal so Charlie Tate from King Kooba will be DJing a set.  This 
is quite an honor since Kooba's latest CD 'Indian Summer' has been in heavy 
rotation at my house for the past few weeks.  They have a great Nu Jazz / 
Dane floor funk sound.  Rob Grega (Zemo) should be making an appearance too. 
Check it out.

[BASSCLOWN] - 1am - Bassclown has just finished a new CD and it has some 
great sounds on it.  Hopefully he'll play some of these new Disco House 
tunes.

NO COVER / 21+ / I.D. Required <--- please bring it or you will not get 
in!!!!
$2 Yuenglings and $3 Sangrias till Midnight or later  ;)
and watch for the free shots at 12:30am ...

{{ Pope Celestine <PopeCelestine@pornstarstyle.com> }
I think CDG3 should be seperate...I mean, I had a blast at Field Day last
year and a lot of the people I did hang out with were Pb-Cle Folk, but a lot
were not. I like that CDG3 is seperate, because it's more akin to a house
party, it's basically invite only, and the people who come are generally
respectable, intelligent people (save for may a certain schizo we know). I
like having one party that's just us, and i certainly wouldn't want to make
Field Day that. }}

I'm with Celeste 100% on this. Plus, we can handle ONE schizo...

...unless you were talking about me. You fuckers can't handle me.

Well...depending on how things go tomorrow, we might have a venue soon.  I
can't tell you about it, but Goose and I are working on this and we think
we may have found out how it's all gonna work.  Hopefully, if things go
right, we can still do it on July the 19th, but it'll be in Pittsburgh.

Combining both cdg and feild day could be the last choice if CDG doesnt go
through this year. That's all I was really saying. Id love to attend both
events this year, and honestly would be happier if the event was in
Pittburgh since Im constantly out that way...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Cook Da Goose III and NRR: Pittsburgh

It's expensive. I did Valhalla there and by the time you 
get security and the venue out of the way, you are
already at top dollar, not too mention I put a $2000 sound
system in the main room. It would be worth doing parties 
there if you could be guaranteed getting over 500 people
without trying to flyer at high schools. It's just not
worth the financial risk. 

Peace,
Luke

Are you sure this is a ritchie set?  I am hearing some deep house about 20 
mins. into it.  If it is I guess that's cool, I guess he just has great 
track selection.  Oh wait heres some more techno, yeah it is ritchie.

Hi everybody --

Sorry for the short notice on this one...We're catching Alex on his way =

FRIDAY, JUNE 13
ALEX HALL (MARSCRUISER)
On Friday, June 13, the weekly ::TRUE:: party is joined by very special =
guest Alex Hall of Marscruiser, along with residents deviant and Jay =
Schamberg.=20

WISCONSIN DANCE MUSIC PRODUCERS?
The land of beer and cheese would seem the least likely place to find =
musical talent in the electronic music department. The state has been =
know for some of it's rock stars: Violent Femmes, Garbage, and the =
BoDeans. But techno? You've got to be kidding! And yet here comes along =
a man from Wisconsin with 10 years of DJ experience looking to change a =
few minds and turn a few heads.=20

Alex Hall is part of the production duo known as Marscruiser. He has had =
tracks appear on Fire Recordings in the UK, SHR/Sunrise in Chicago, Max =
Music in Florida, and Barely There Records in Wisconsin. That's right, a =
techno label from Wisconsin. And his story doesn't stop there. His =
tracks have been played by John Digweed, Hybrid, Lee Burridge, and Cass =
all over the globe, including Radio 1 and KISS FM in London. You'd think =
the damn cheeseheads would be happy enough there.=20

His most recent work was with the infamous George Clinton, as well as =
renowned breaks producer Andy Page from Australia. His productions have =
also been in the charts of Chris Fortier, D:Fuse, and Markus Schulz.=20

His dark progressive DJ style is cutting edge and his sets are always =
full of surprises, mixing in a bit of breakbeat and house here and =
there, always moving the crowd. His sets have appeared on XM Radio and =
93.7 in Chicago.

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Krush

I don't recall where I found DJ Krush's new album on Slsk ("The Message at 
the Depth"). I think it was from one of you listees. Anyway, it moved me 
quite a bit. I recommend that anyone check it out. You can find it on my 
slsk now too. I'm pangea33. (btw- I am currently rocking the deep hawtin 
link someone just sent....hotness!)


Check this review out, good stuff.....

DJ Krush Goes Coastal

Ten years ago, it was difficult for American hip-hop audiences to finally 
accept that strong MCs and DJs were coming out of the West Coast. But as 
left-coast gangsta' rap began to dominate headphones and Impala speakers in 
the late eighties and early nineties, a growing resentment started to build 
in the New York-based cradle of hip-hop. The bile turned caustic as 
producers like Dr. Dre rebuilt top-forty radio with a new blueprint called 
G-Funk. Leaning heavily on hooks from James Brown and George Clinton songs, 
the West Coast variety proved that rap music could be effectively sold to 
every demographic in America, from metropolitan roots to the planned 
communities of suburbia. Sure, there's a lot more to the entire East 
Coast/West Coast rap debate than this. Music critics have written entire 
books on the subject. But it all basically stems from a conflict of styles. 
That's why it's difficult to understand how a turntablist like DJ Krush 
could be so widely accepted, and even admired. After all, DJ Krush is from 
way past the West Coast.

Born and raised in Japan, Krush credits the traveling Wild Style tour of the 
early eighties with introducing him to hip-hop. When he witnessed the 
infamous break-dancing and turntable crew performing in a Tokyo department 
store in 1984, he was inspired. The next day he went out and bought a 
turntable, mixer and sampler, and began scratching immediately. In 1987 he 
formed the Krush Posse with members of the local hip-hop scene, including 
his brother. But this early work was more of an imitation of what was 
happening in America than a distinct style of its own. By the early nineties 
Krush had broken off from this group and began exploring varieties that were 
all his own. By then his fascination with international jazz found its way 
into the music he was mixing. The work attracted the attention of 
Gangstarr's Guru, whose 1993 album Jazzmatazz Vol. 1 would try to work the 
magic with jazz and hip-hop stateside. Krush worked with Guru, as well Black 
Thought from the Roots, on Meiso, his 1996 album. Meiso also featured a 
collaboration with DJ Shadow that marked the arrival of the genre we now 
refer to as trip-hop. In fact, many credit Krush with helping to invent 
trip-hop. His later ground-breaking work mixing avant garde jazz trumpeter 
Toshinori Kondo on the album Ki-Oku, is complex and unique. It might be one 
of the best jazz albums to come out of the last decade.

Krush's latest album, The Message at the Depth, ignores much of his previous 
jazz and trip-hop work. Instead, he utilizes the musical platform to 
question the nature of truth and conflict in the world, as we teeter on the 
brink of war. The CD feels more electronic than his previous work, leaning 
on his sampler for much of the sound manipulation to get his point across. 
The layered fragments are sharp, like freshly cut aluminum. Their resonating 
tones leave a metallic taste in your mouth as you struggle to make sense of 
Krush's new message. In a way, the irritated quality that Krush produces 
seem like a person who's drunk way too many cups of coffee, or maybe 
something even stronger. But all the while you'll notice that your head is 
bobbing and your foot is tapping.

Tracks like "Toki No Tabiji (Journey of Time)" and "Sanity Requiem" resonate 
like a symphony of insects. They're powerful pieces to throw at the 
beginning of the album, with "Toki No Tabiji (Journey of Time)" featuring a 
hard-sounding newcomer Japanese MC named Inden. It's clear from listening to 
these two tracks that DJ Krush has moved far beyond the mere art of 
scratching. The beat is a stuttered amalgamation of bass booms and drum 
machines, all slowed way down. Krush's technical skills are amazing, with 
his ability to build a beat seemingly out of thin air. He's managed to 
construct a totally new way of meshing rhythms.

The rest of the album is an interesting pastiche of guest appearances -- 
from the gifted Angelina Esparza, who sings like a more sultry Tori Amos (if 
that's possible) to underground hip-hop acts like Opus. In fact, most of the 
collaborations on the album are with artists known for bridging the gap 
between genres. Sly and Robbie, for example, whose 1970s and 80s style dub 
influenced just about every modern musical variety on the planet. Or 
Anti-Pop Consortium, rap artists who have dabbled in electronica.

The short "Supreme Team" features flow from Anti-Pop Consortium and a 
plodding, big beat sound, like furniture being moved around on the ceiling. 
Anti-Pop's smart rhymes and underground hip-hop sound work well with Krush's 
steady beats. The hooks he creates aren't anything you've heard before, but 
still subtle enough not to compete with the vocals. This is one of the 
album's highlights, flowing as though DJ Krush and Anti-Pop Consortium were 
meant to play together. Krush tends to have that effect on a lot of artists.

He teams up with underground rapper Anticon on the oddball "Song for John 
Walker". This ode to the man dubbed "The American Taliban", captured in 
Afghanistan during the U.S.-led invasion in 2001, sums up the feeling of the 
entire album. Anticon's style is as absurd as the rhymes in this song, and 
it's interesting to see the lack of seriousness that Krush devotes to the 
central idea of the album. "We know John Walker / We know John Walker" is 
repeated in each chorus, and the song asks us to think about how different 
this so-called terrorist is from the people we grew up with, or those that 
lead us.

Krush goes so far as to team up with the world's most famous rhythm-section. 
Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare add their trademark to "The Lost Voices", 
collaborators who are better known by their first names. Krush uses the 
track as a good excuse to lighten things up somewhat. Still, the dub only 
barely masks the ominous feeling that dominates The Message at the Depth. 
This might be Krush's first attempt at mixing dub, at least on record, and 
he proves his skills easily here. The track also sets up the album's 
epilogue nicely. "What About Tomorrow", featuring vocals from reggae singer 
Ras Abijah, serves Krush's case against the four horsemen of the apocalypse, 
and at the same time asks what we're going to do to make the future better 
than the present. "What About Tomorrow" sees DJ Krush dipping into the dub 
realm once again, while maintaining the somber tone of the rest of the 
album. It's the lyrics that flicker hopefully, an unusual way for a 
turntablist to go out. But then, this has always been DJ Krush's hallmark, 
and most intriguing quality. He's not so rooted in a style or scene that he 
won't turn on a dime to get his message across, without going coastal.

Subject: {pb-cle} techno

do any of you know a good site for information on techno artists 
including up to date vinyl and cd releases, tour dates, etc. my primary 
concerns are for minimal techno artists, swedish techno artists (beyer, 
lekebusch, etc) and detroit artists (don't think i need to list any of 
these), also artists like marco corolla and such. I am looking for 
something with the quality of the drum and bass arena 
(www.breakbeat.co.uk) only focusing on techno.

if anyone can help i greatly appreciate it!

our experience with O2 was that it was very hard to get into, you 
basically had to know the person answering the call box.  there was a 
bit of attitude even after they opened the door.  not sure if thats the 
M.O. but i didn't like it.  the webpage pretty much says "go away, only 
for private events."

moose?  it changed any?

Well it's still a private club. I would suggest that you go to the door, and
say that moose told me about the place, etc etc, and that should be fine.
I'll tell the owners that I told the pb-cle list about the place, so
hopefully everything will be cool. 

 

By the way, Jimmy Klockwerk is working the door, so if you know him, you'll
also be fine.

 

Hope this helps.thing is, they have to cover their back since it is a
'private' club.

.42 a record isn't too bad for what you got. Flea markets are good for
this kind of stuff... if you are ever up in Cleveland, check out one of
the Record Exchanges here... they get all their records in on trade, and
I'll usually find 20 or so records at a time, and they'll charge me like
$2 or $3 for all of them. You'll find some serious gems in there!

I just bought a bunch of shit last week, got...
Prince, "Purple Rain" 
the rock opera, "Chess," has "One Night in Bangkok" on it (double lp)
J Geils Band, "Freeze Frame" 
Styx, "Paradise Theater," 
Madonna, "Like a Virgin" 
Rick Springfield, "Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet" 
Whitesnake, "Slide It In" 
Cindy Lauper, "She's So Unusual" 
The Church, "Starfish"
Howard Jones, "Humans Lib"
Thompson Twins, "Here's to Future Days"
Greg Kihn Band "Kihnspiracy"
Top Gun Soundtrack
Flashdance Soundtrack 
...among a bunch of others for $1.00.

Check it out sometime...

Well, that's assuming that these kids are using  (just) MDMA to begin
with.
Most of the retarded kids will be like "yeah, I had seven pills before I
came here, did three bumps of K, then I dropped a sheet of acid.  You
got any meth?"

That shit will stunt your growth any day.

---When that happens its usually because one of 2 things. 1.) E alone by its 
self is highly expensive so in order to further supplement that drug of 
choice, they do other drugs to curb their addictions. Or 2.) to increase the 
length level of stupidity off of one drug by doing others eventually 
extending the length of that drug.
It amazes me still that people still don't want to except that these drugs 
are addictive both psychologically and physically.
Anything of that nature that you put in your body is going to develop into 
an addictive property.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Start tha puddle

MDMA is not physically addictive - as in, it does not create PHYSICAL symptoms of withdrawl (shakes, flu-like symptoms, etc). Mental addiction is an entirely different animal, but let's not confuse it with actual *physical* addiction. 

"Anything of that nature that you put in your body is going to develop into 
an addictive property." -- I must take issue with this statement. People put all sorts of things into their bodies to which they never become addicted.

---When that happens its usually because one of 2 things. 1.) E alone by its 
self is highly expensive so in order to further supplement that drug of 
choice, they do other drugs to curb their addictions. Or 2.) to increase the 
length level of stupidity off of one drug by doing others eventually 
extending the length of that drug.
It amazes me still that people still don't want to except that these drugs 
are addictive both psychologically and physically.
Anything of that nature that you put in your body is going to develop into

I don't know about this. I remember night terrors, cold sweats, jitters,
not to mention some strange tingling is my extremities when I would turn
me head. This all after a rather stupid  2 week bender. Nothing else
ingested other then E. However doesn't mean it wasn't something that
they where cut with. This all lasted and built with greater intensity
until the next Friday. I went out and partied and sure enough all
problems went away. Wasn't even aware of what was wrong until that
Friday. That was my last weekend. I got the same symptoms as before but
just went with it till they vanished. The tingly thing was pretty scary.
Didn't even know how to describe it to someone. If I turned my head to
the left then my right arms would tingle. When I would try and sleep I
would get pulses through my body that where very unpleasant.

OOOoooOOO, my personal favorite feeling from E-Tardedness was by FAR tha electric shocks that I got a few times in my kidney.  Hurt so bad I screamed.  Fucking scary.
 
I'm not saying other drugs are better, but I seriously dislike ecstasy.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Start tha puddle

Sounds very unpleasant. I have no doubt that this happened to you, but I don't know what to tell you since MDMA has no medically documented physical withdrawl symptoms. Some people just have bad luck with certain substances. My body, for example, is fine with eating eggplant - but my husband's, well, let's just say he has to sleep upstairs after he's eaten it. =)my

I certainly can't use my personal experience with MDM* as a gauge, since over the 6 years I've been doing e I've never had these negative effects. I don't do it very often anymore, because I rarely go out and I don't know any drug dealers ... but even in college when I was doing it every weekend, as long as I slept afterwards I felt fine. Everyone's brain chemistry is different; it's good to know our own personal limits.

I don't know about this. I remember night terrors, cold sweats, jitters,
not to mention some strange tingling is my extremities when I would turn
me head. This all after a rather stupid  2 week bender. Nothing else
ingested other then E. However doesn't mean it wasn't something that
they where cut with. This all lasted and built with greater intensity
until the next Friday. I went out and partied and sure enough all
problems went away. Wasn't even aware of what was wrong until that
Friday. That was my last weekend. I got the same symptoms as before but
just went with it till they vanished. The tingly thing was pretty scary.
Didn't even know how to describe it to someone. If I turned my head to
the left then my right arms would tingle. When I would try and sleep I
would get pulses through my body that where very unpleasant.

Not everyday but just about every other day.

But as you say if it is NOT addictive then the frequency would not
matter.
If it was just a result of stressing my body then doing it several days
later would not have removed them symptoms. I have done research as well
and found the same information that you are speaking of but I know from
my exp and the exp of others I know that I am not the only one who has
reacted like this. 

But to be fair how often are you taking just MDMA it always cut with
shit. Now a days you have to be pretty brave to even think about buying
it.

There is no way I'd waste the money to do MDMA every other day. Not only would I feel like shit from having my serotonin depleted, but even increasing my dosage would stop working pretty quickly. One day off inbetween dosing wouldn't be enough time for my brain to build its serotonin back up - so when I would take additional pills, they wouldn't be as strong as they should. Definitely a huge waste of money, at the very least.

"Addiction" is not the same thing as "developing a tolerance." One DOES develop a strong tolerance to e if one does it a couple days in a row.

I don't know a single person who has done e every other day for two weeks.

It's funny to me how the people who have abused drugs so heavily are the first ones to get all self-righteously anti-drug once they've seen the error of their ways. Then it becomes *the rest of us* who have the problem.

It's usually not cut with anything *harmful* (poison being bad for business and all) - chances are the filler is just non-active byproduct. I've gotten e sold to me as DXM a couple times, and I'm allergic to DXM unless I take an antihistamine first so that sucked ... but that's only when I've been dumb enough not to test my pills first (either by tasting it, which I'm pretty good at, or by using the marquis reagent). YMMV

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Start tha puddle

There is no way I'd waste the money to do MDMA every other day. Not only
would I feel like shit from having my serotonin depleted, but even
increasing my dosage would stop working pretty quickly. One day off
inbetween dosing wouldn't be enough time for my brain to build its
serotonin back up - so when I would take additional pills, they wouldn't
be as strong as they should. Definitely a huge waste of money, at the
very least.

> Agreed but it was kind of there for whoever whenever at the time. This
was many years ago.

"Addiction" is not the same thing as "developing a tolerance." One DOES
develop a strong tolerance to e if one does it a couple days in a row. 
>I wasn't talking about tolerance I was not talking about how I felt
when I stopped taking it.

I don't know a single person who has done e every other day for two
weeks.
> I could name to many to email.

It's funny to me how the people who have abused drugs so heavily are the
first ones to get all self-righteously anti-drug once they've seen the
error of their ways. Then it becomes *the rest of us* who have the
problem.

> How was I being anti-drug. I was just saying what happened. Why do you
seem to be taking this so personally. I did not once tell you not to do
it. Or that you shouldn't do it. All I said was ... When I took it ....
Happened. When I stopped taking it .... Happened.

It's usually not cut with anything *harmful* (poison being bad for
business and all) - chances are the filler is just non-active byproduct.
I've gotten e sold to me as DXM a couple times, and I'm allergic to DXM
unless I take an antihistamine first so that sucked ... but that's only
when I've been dumb enough not to test my pills first (either by tasting
it, which I'm pretty good at, or by using the marquis reagent). YMMV

> DXM, PCP, Coke, Caffeine, Backing Soda, ... and more times then I can
count Tweak.
 Testing with the reagent only tells you if e is present. And tasting it
is not what I would call a safe way to test.

I have to need to start what may seem like a don't do this because its
bad thread. I was just saying what happened to me. If your being safe
and having fun then by all means indulge.

Interesting....
I was definitely sleeping a lot. Party, crash, sleep watch tv, wake, and
go party. So it was kind of an every other day.

However I remember reading that serration besides being mood altering
also plays apart in sleep and rem sleep. I am going to go see if I can
find some more info on this.

Not that I don't LOVE getting two copies of every single post, but it is REALLY ANNOYING when all
you have to do is reply to the list. Or reply to me personally. Not both.

Thanks,

Amanda

Subject: {pb-cle} Burning Man



Burning Man needs a bit of help, and it needs it
fast, so please read on. As you may or may not have heard, the Washoe County
Board of Commissioners have refused Burning Man a permit to use property
they own near Gerlach, from which the event is staged. This staging area is
the ranch from which all operations are run, and where all the gear is
stored. Apparently, if they can't use this land, it will make it nearly
impossible to organize the event.
BM has requested that as many people as possible show up at the county
meeting on June 10th in Reno to voice their opinions, and that those who
can't make it write letters to the Reno Gazette voicing their displeasure. I
figure that a petition wouldn't hurt either, so here's the plan:
We need to get at least 5000 signatures in the next 4 days, so we really
need to move on this. Please go to the petition site at the link below
immediately, sign it, and forward this email to as many sympathetic people
as possible. It would probably work best to simply copy and paste this msg
into a new email rather then forward so as to avoid getting the text all
screwed up, as often happens in forwards.
I'll be informing the BM organizers of the petition in hope that they also
spread the word, and so that they can bring a printout to the meeting.
Again... sorry for the spam, but I figured that this is worth it. The
petition 
is can be signed here:
http://www.petitiononline.com/burn42/petition.html

So, I'm playing All-Star Baseball 2003 on my PS2.  Yankees at Anahiem.

I hit a home run to left field, and during the replay I check out one of =
the signs just over the wall in left:

"All Your Base Are Belong To Us."

Well, I'll be damned, I guess it/they does/do.

 I wish I'd screenshot that bitch.

there are all sorts of restrictions on what you can do with
property you own. there is zoning that dictates what you can do
with property. more understandably is the fact that owning
property doesnt allow you to break the law on that property. lots
of drug use and quite possibly numerous other illegal activies
take place at burning man every year.

Lets you scratch ANYTHING using Max/MSP and Jitter.. hook your turntables up 
and start scratching your quicktime movies, your audio files, your filter 
parameters, whatever you want.

Sounds freakin cool...

any thoughts?  anybody familiar with Max/MSP?  Am I the only one with a mac 
any more? :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Wednesday Nights on the Patio

We are going to be getting a weekly started at the bar formally known as
Fat Pats in Berea off of front street. They have completely redone the
deck and have given us Wednesday nights outside. The patio has been done
up nice and is definitely hot.

We are wanting to start out light and up beat and progress into harder
styles of music.
So just about anything will go. If your interested in spinning drop me
an email and preferably a link to a mix of yours. 

Unfortunately until we can prove to the owners that we can bring a
decent crowd all our work is voluntary. Of course if we can get some
people in there then we can also get paid.

Also if you don't plan on staying most of the evening then please don't
respond. It doesn't do us any good to try and get a decent weekly going
when even the dj's wont support it.

We are aiming for 2 weeks from tomorrow. But that may get pushed back a
week depending on if we can get flyers made and handed out in time.

i know of four pittsburgh djs playing at Dance Pass. i
know two other names from cleveland one of whom plays
dnb. i dont know what the other guy plays but you all
would know his name. acutally, i didnt even know this
dude spun.

i dont know if the promoter would want me to say the
names of who is playing. im not trying to be cool.
that just comes naturally.

i do know that it supposed to be pretty underground.
well, more underground than usual. i was a little
shocked to hear it was on hyperreal. thought it was
gonna be an invite only thing.

peace,
clevr

brothers track that the beat is sampled from "between the sheets". 

>3) Bon Jovi - Livin on a Prayer

yeah that album is always with me too. 

>and the #1
>Vanilla Ice - Ice Ice Baby

i bring that sometimes. 

other tunes i always bring:
metallica "battery" 
the pogues "if i should fall from grace with god"
murder inc "mrs whiskey name" (the industrial band, not the wack
rap crew)
montell jordan "this is how we do it" (white girls love that shit)
bobby brown "my perrogative"
cutty ranks "limb by limb"
aaliyah "try again"
new order "blue monday"
enya "orinoco flow"
miles davis "bitches brew"
big tymers "still fly"
mystikal "shake ya ass"
aus rotten "the system works for them"

stuff like that always works for me.

there were no breaks there though, so maybe im not that cool.

Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and Students for Sensible Drug Policy =
(SSDP). One of the biggest reasons the Drug Policy Alliance waged a =
national campaign to stop the RAVE Act was that we feared it would be =
used to shut down political events like this.

On the day the fundraiser was set to take place a Billings-based DEA =
agent presented the venue owners with a copy of the RAVE Act warning =
them that they could face a fine of $250,000 if illicit drugs were found =
in the premises. The bands - most of which regularly played at the venue =
- were also approached and warned that their participation in the event =
could result in a fine.

Rather than risk the possibility of enormous fines, the venue decided to =
cancel the event. This blatant intimidation by the DEA was obviously =
designed to shut down the marijuana reform fundraiser. Unless the =
American people speak out against this attack on free speech, the DEA =
will be emboldened to use the law against other events they do not like, =
such as all-night dance parties, hip hop concerts, hemp festivals, and =
circuit parties.


This is starting to sound like old school Russia to me!!!

hmmm, smacks of false advertising.  advertise 25$ at the door.  jack em 
for 30.
and the message has a scan of the flyer showing 20$/25$

i've always wondered if the after midnight thing is a loophole since its 
tecnically the next day?

take em to people's court.  whopner oughta straighten this out.

Subject: {pb-cle} Chaka Khan

There is some cool stuff coming up at Hartwood Acres this summer. Most 
notably, to me, comes on June 22 when Chaka Khan will be there.

Some of the rest of the lineup looks pretty appealing to me as well, but you 
can look into it if you're interested.

i was actually reall dissappointed in this year's lineup aside
from chaka khan. the rusted root show will be the biggest anus
fest of all time. the best show ive ever seen at hartwood was a
couple summers ago when parliament/funkadelic rocked it. they had
to play for at least 3 hours for free. you just cant fuck with that.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} TITONTON - FRIDAY - SAUCE

titonton for free is the illest deal to hit this city in a minute.
the venue is nice and cozy, should be fun once he starts
unleashing the funky shit. his most recent tunes are some of my
absolute favorites, really techno influenced broken beats. plus as
you all should know, hes cool with the 2000 Black crew which means
he gets the hookup from all those west london cats. he played the
Bugz in the Attic night "the co-op" earlier this year in london. i
cant wait.

i'd drive out there just to hear her sing 'ain't nobody'.  i think i'll play
that on the radio
tonight.  tune in if you need something in your ear.  i play a lot of 80s
stuff,  electro,
downtempo and random other good stuff that works.  i enjoy requests that
make some
sort of sense ;p

midnight - 4am tonight.  91.3fm or www.wyep.org .

Now maybe I'm on crack today, but the event isn't even listed on the
website }}

It's more likely that the promoter is on crack. We all know that the kids on
Bluelight are a bunch of rock-toasting crack-babies.

I will say this, however. Any of you crackers (Tom is a cracker) who give a
shit about breaks need to check out Jen Lasher and Clay-Born. No
disappointments there. Now all we need to do is to get 513 promoters to
actually throw parties IN 513! There's a NOVEL CONCEPT! I doubt i'll make it
up for this but you never know...

"Dirty Thumb" J.[M] aka Gramps

I don't smoke crack, I lick it. And Marisa loves rim-jobs.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Jun 14                          SE7EN                           NE Ohio

On Saturday, June 14th, 2003 Unified Entertainment, Wishing Well, and 
Phareal Productions bring you up to Northeast Ohio again for.........

"SE7EN"

Pride, Anger, Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, and Lust.

These are the things that come between people in general, promoters, 
cities, and different scenes that end up destroying it if it isn't fixed. 
This event will feature djs from all over and the main theme is for us to 
look at what we do every day that might hurt our scene and work on 
changing it. We think that if we can all throw away the bickering and the 
arguing this area of Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Dayton, 
Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Indianapolis, Nashville, and any other 
cities that are involved in our scene every week will be the talk 
everywhere as the places to be or just the Midwest in general.

Sat Jun 14                     SOMETHING TO DO                   Pittsburgh

Something To Do

Tired of saying there is nothing to do? Tired of the same ol' same ol' 
rave atmosphere? Tired of Mc Donalds trying to come up with something new 
and innovative but all they come up with is the Mc Bratwurst? Well thats 
too bad...sucks to be you.

But we are having an event that is an effort to re-establish the 
pittsburgh scene by giving you "Something To Do". This will not be the 
typical rave, this wont be the typical club, and this wont be the typical 
not rave/not club. What we are trying to do is make this a bi-weekly event 
in which we bring in DJ's and or bands that YOU want to hear and that we 
can afford...not what these promoters think you want to hear. As well as 
bringing in what you want to hear, we also throw some new faces into the 
mix. I mean lets face it, it seems that every flyer you look at has the 
same DJ's, the same tag team specials and the same venues all of the time. 
Time for a change. Depending on the turn out of this first event, we will 
have an event where we bring the variety stylee every other saturday. Some 
of the things to do so far will be as follows:

Random Stuff FREE Raffles

Video Games

Answer a Trivia Question at the door and get $1 off (30 second time limit)

Vote for your favorite DJ of the night

Vote for local bands or djs that you would like to see at our event.

Vote for genres you would like to see more of at our event

Vote for the new president of Guam

Mainly we just want to hear your opinion, and give you something to do in 
this seemingly boring town.


The confirmed Dj's are as follows:

Cutups [Ragga] - Crazy ass ragga shit.

2rip [Not Trance] - Commin in with a suprise non trancey stylee

B Rivers [Hardcore] - Not that happy crap your mom gives you.

Jake vs. Dj Resolution (Faithindnb Systems) [DnB] - Wicked tag team from 
the up and comming big wigs.

E-ditty w/Mc Ja bless[DnB] - Thats right!! Ja bless comming the whole way 
from Flordia to rock it for you katz.

Dire Code [Screamo Hardcore Band]- Bringing the change up to the typical 
rave atmosphere, be sure to check them out.

Darkbert (Steel City Hardcore) [Experimental Thrashcore]- Bringing the 
craziness with a blend of noise and weird shit you've never heard before.

Price: $5 CHEAPER THAN 6.99!!!!!

Support us...we arent here to bank off of you, we are here to make things 
better for you. We do this for the people, not ourselves.

If you want to be heard, dont forget to bring demos!!!!!

P.S.- You know the drill, no DRUGS, no WEAPONS, no MARKERS, no NAKED 
PICTURES OF BEA ARTHUR, no CHEEZ WHIZ and TOWNHOUSE CRACKER 
SANDWITCHES..... because they will be taken from you.

Sat Jun 21                     PHOENIX RISING                    Pittsburgh

Phoenix Rising

A 24 hour Summer Solstice Festival
Music starts @ noon on June 21st 2003
Finishing about noon on June 22nd 2003


Eternal Youth, Visions of Rhythm, Time Space Illusion
& Flux Capacitor, the four companies
who brought you Phoenix 2002 are teaming up again to
resurect the Phoenix, even bigger &
more brilliant than last year.

Those who were there know what a great party Phoenix
was and those who weren't heard what they missed. We
are refining the event emphasizing the positive
aspects to make this one even better than last year.
With that in mind we are focusing more on quality over
qunatity(not that last years lineup wasn't loaded with
great talent). We are reducing the number of stages
however in doing so we will be esuring every stage has
atleast the level of sound as the most bangin system
at last years event. We will also have much more
intense light & laser setups on all stages. In
addition to visuals & some other very special
surprises.

In doing a sequel we feel it important to outdo its
predecesor, while our focus is to deliver a better
production as opposed to spreading ourselves thin
again. We still intend to deliver an event of atleast
the magnitude of last year, in order to do this we are
extending the hours of the event making this years
event a 24 hour festival.
Thats right Phoenix Rising will be a 24 hour event !!!
nonstop from 12noon saturday until 12 noon sunday.
It seems quite appropriate that the festival of the
sun bird begin and end with the highest point of the
sun while at its closest point to the earth.

Confirmed Talent:

--- Frankie Bones
--- Heather Heart
--- DJ Rap
--- Venom
--- DJ Pauly
--- Anita Decastro
--- Dj Hooty
--- Dj Walkingstick
--- AC Slater
--- Breakbeat Militia = Clevr+Zone+Moose+Hutch

JERRY BONHAM  (bedrock, renaissance, saw, spundae, san francisco)

Jerry Bonham, a pioneer in progressive, has been doing what he does best
for almost three decades. Jerry is a living legend - one of the true
beacons of electronic dance music.

Born in North Dakota, Jerry Bonham grew up listening to pop music from the
'70's, everything ranging from Barry White, and Sly to the Family Stone.  
In 1976 at the height of the Disco Era, Jerry ventured into Minneapolis,
where he began his DJing career. Later, Michael Graber, a Chicago DJ,
introduced Jerry to the infinite possibilities of mixing and live
composition, guided him away from simply being a mobile DJ. Instead of
playing only the hits like many fellow jockeys of that time, Jerry favored
the less-obvious works.

In 1988, he relocated from Minneapolis to San Francisco, where he became
engrossed in its local scene and fell in love with the people, the music
and the city. In early 1996, Jerry started his residency at San Fran's
super club Spundae/Nikita at 1015 Folsom. As the partnership grew, he
became co-owner of the Spundae Reckords Store located on Haight Street.

Jerry Bonham's DJing career on the dance floor skyrocketed during the late
'90's, his production standards paralleled the rise, hit after hit. In
1998, Jerry's first mix CD, "Interpretations," was released on Spundae
Recordings, followed by his celebrated 1999 release "Tranceglobalnation 3"
on Arcade America, one of Europe's most respected and influential
electronic dance music labels. "Interpretations II" is Jerry's latest mix
compilation released on Mute and Spundae Recordings. The CD was an instant
hit with 20,000 pre-sold copies.

In the recording studio, Jerry forged on to refine his progressive sound,
recording a remix of Expansion's "Listen" for the Texas based Funked-Up
Label. He is also part of the JSJ collective, also known as Jondi, Spesh,
and Jerry Bonham. Together, they recorded "Deep Love 9" and "Ghost of You"
on Renaissance; both tracks became the must-haves in a DJ's crate - two
absolute floor-fillers. In early 2001 Jerry recorded the single "Erendira"
(Spanish for "joy") with Planetary Consciousness on Bedrock. His recent
studio work is the solo track called "Seventh Seal", a 12-minute long
journey that opens with beautiful tunes and stripped drums, eventually
evolving into a complex web of progressive sounds and melodies.

John Digweed noted Jerry as a "world-class DJ", who "has been one of the
main pioneers of the progressive sound on the West Coast since the very
start, forever championing the latest sounds and pushing the music
forward." Dave Ralph added that Jerry is "the most underrated DJ in
America, who has real talent and depth."

Jerry Bonham has helped to define America's electronic dance music
movement with his flawless performances, and extraordinary production
skills.  Forever influencing the music, Jerry Bonham continues to love the
music as passionately as he lives and creates it.

Thu Jul 03                         KABOOM                            Canton

Universal Groove & Pipeline Productions present...

Kaboom!
A 4th of July weekend kickoff!!!

Featuring...

DJ Assault:
Jefferson Ave. / Fused
Ghetto Tech - Detroit, MI / Atlanta, GA

Born and raised in Detroit, Craig came to dance music like many of his 
Motown brethren, via the radio. Detroit radio jocks like the Electrifying 
Mojo, The Wizard (Jeff Mills' alter ego) and Chicago's Hotmix Five all 
made lasting impressions on the young artist. Mixing records since 1982, 
Craig has been indoctrinating people with his own take on electronic and 
dance music, which is very much an amalgam of his radio predecessors. From 
the Mojo's funky eclecticism to Mills' introduction of scratching to 
non-Hip Hop genres of music, his style is something that could only have 
come from Detroit. Along the way, DJ Assault was born. Anything is game 
when Assault DJs, be it house, techno, jungle, R & B or whatever -- as 
long as booties are bouncing. He has rocked parties around the world, 
including sets in Germany, Holland, France, Spain and throughout North 
America. Each time it's the same: When he steps up to the decks and 
unleashes that high-speed booty-shake, the audience has only one option -- 
to shut up and dance.


Annalyze:
Skyehigh / Stanton / Fused
Breaks/2-Step - Rochester, NY

Rochester NY's leading lady of 2-Step, Annalyze has been regularly rocking 
the Upstate, New York rave/club scene for close to three years. During her 
DJ set's, Anna combines an energetic stage presence with the hottest 
tracks in the 2-Step genre and the occasional break-beat track, as well as 
a bit of DMC scratching and turntable trickery, creating a vibe that keeps 
the dance floor packed and moving all night long. Having established a 
reputation as a constant crowd pleaser, Anna can often be found stepping 
away from the turntables, and joining the crowd on the dance floor during 
one of her legendary DJ sets.


Snyper feat. MC Enda:
GSP / Science Funktion / Subtech Audio / 4-Score / Still Vapor / Pipeline 
AM
Drum & Bass - Atlanta, GA

Snyper has been a native to the Atlanta underground for quite some time. 
In the mid nineties, spinning under various aliases such as "Jinx" and 
"Furious Stylz", Snyper aka Scott Thomas developed his skills spinning at 
various spots in the early Atlanta EDM scene. In early '99, teaming up 
with the notorious jungle dj Kysa, to form Link Productions, the duo set 
new standards in the stateside breakbeat hardcore scene, dropping 
mind-blowing tag sets all over the southeast that would go back and forth 
from drum n' bass to breakz with no apparent seam, hence bridging the 
"Link" between the two genres. By the year 2000, the drum n' bass 
influence took over and became Snyper's passion and main focus of 
exploration. In 2000, Snyper founded "Science Funktion Recordings", which 
became a collective label of extremely talented, up and coming dj's, 
producers, and emcees who ripped up the local/national scene with a wide 
array of styles including drum n' bass, breakbeat, house, hip hop, garage, 
electro, hardcore, trance, progressive, and everything in between. At this 
point in his career, Snypers style began to include elements not seen or 
heard thus far...fusing high energy, driving neurofunk sound with the 
darker, rolling, more abstract techstep feel, with scratching and 
turntablism techniques involved, Snyper has developed a very unique style, 
making dancefloors explode wherever he touches down.

JJ Boogie:
Fused Management / Well Known DJS / www.groovereactor.com
Trance / Progressive House - Cincinnati, OH
"GENESIS Tour 2003"

Don't miss JJ on this official tour stop. With over 7 years of DJing 
experience, producing for 4 years, and throwing some of the sickest Ohio 
events for the last 5, JJ has become one of the most recognized DJS 
around. He's played major events across the country including the WEMF in 
Canada in 2002, the WMC in Miami in 2003, and Live on the Decks 5 in 
Chicago and last year's tour sent JJ to Canada, Boston, Miami, Los 
Angeles, Miwaukee, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Nashville, Louisville, to 
name just a few stops. JJ will be giving away 100+ copies of his latest 
mixed CD - GENESIS 2003, his much anticipated follow up to last year's 
GENESIS Volume 1 CD. The GENESIS 2003 CD includes some of the hardest 
hitting trance and house tracks you will ever hear as well as JJ's eagerly 
awaited follow up production work to COMA with his "Big Room" remix of 
Solar Stone - Seven Cities. This CD is also JJ's first full release mixed 
exclusively on the FINAL SCRATCH System by STANTON. Don't miss your chance 
to get a free copy of this banging CD and catch one of the Midwest's 
finest DJ/Producers.

DJ D8A:
Buckwyld Entertainment / Groove Reactor Records
Hard Style - Dayton, OH

A Midwest pioneer of the new "Hardstyle" sound, D8A has ripped up floors 
with the likes of Christopher Lawrence, Josh Da Funky 1, Frankie Bones, 
and DJ Dan. D8A's sound is a hard mix of trance, house and techno grooves 
- filled with slamming basslines. On top of being a recognized midwest 
favorite, he also helms Buckwyld Entertainment and throws some of the 
craziest midwest events around. D8A will be giving away plenty of CDS and 
expect a high-energy dance fest as soon as the first needle drops.

Jul 11-13                         TEKNIVAL                     Toronto area


::::::::::: Teknival (Technival):::::::::::

PLEASE SEE http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival FOR FULL DETAILS!!!

-a FREE festival of like minded people coming together to party, dance & 
unify in dissent.

-a celebration of DIY attitudes.

-an experiment in non-hierarchical organization and an attempt to prove 
the merits of a money free economy.

-an action of reclaiming space, utilizing public land that should be used 
by the public, but which often just sits there, unappreciated and unused.

-the creation of an autonamous zone. A space where the normal rules of 
society (both social and economic) are not applicable, and a new system is 
put in place by its inhabitans.

-an open invitation to all, regardless of lifestyle to get involved & MAKE 
SOME FUCKING NOISE!!!

:::TEKNIVAL:::JULY 11-13, 2003:::

Teknival, the name given to these free post society festivals by our 
European predecessors, have been common there for over a decade, 
reclaiming the countryside for all to enjoy.

Our teknival is no different. On July 11th- 13th, soundsystems hailing 
from cities all over the east coast of North America will be liberating a

Sat Jul 19                       JEDI NIGHT                          Toledo

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Jedi Night
July 19th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring Djs:

Josh the Funky 1 - Chicago, IL - House - Funktion Recordings , IHR, Kid
Dynamite Recordings

Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, and
breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks.

In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In
the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at the
Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.

Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh
has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , "Bangin the
Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

As if his DJ'ing accomplishments weren't enough, Josh has also had his
hand in the studio producing tracks for the infamous Chicago labels I.H.R,
Kid Dynamite, and Strictly Hype Recordings. His tracks have been featured
on mix compilations and DJ play-lists throughout the world, further
establishing his reputation as a DJ/Producer. Josh has also lent a hand in
remixing for Chicago's number one house diva, Dajae. Her first single on
Kid Dynamite records entitled "Time" is an uplifting vocal anthem that has
received Billboard attention and has since been licensed to Credence
records in U.K. Most Recently Josh has re-mixed Dajae's newest single
"Everyday", also on Kid Dynamite records and already licensed to Defected
Records U.K.

Not one to be content with only producing records for other labels. In
2001 "The Funky 1" launched his own record label, Funktion Recordings. The
first release "Everybody Everywhere" by BSJ and Fun-K has found its way
into the record boxes of DJ's worldwide.

2003 shows no signs of slowing down as producers such as Santos Scanty,
and Jelo continue to churn out dancefloor stormers for his label. When not
in the studio or running the label, Josh is constantly touring the world
bringing his sound and skills together for the masses.

E-Sassin - Los Angeles, CA - DnB - Sound Sphere Recordings, Phunkatek
Recordings, Just Two

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran of the
Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical journey in the
late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and jazz/fusion bands which
helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. After a short stint in
the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to the electronic dance
scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. "Once I started getting
into producing dance music, I finally felt I was on the right track to
where I wanted to be musically. My reputation as a cutting edge producer,
and later as a DJ, steadily grew, and so did the work.

In 1992 E-Sassin produced and self-released a techno album which got the
attention of Sunshine Records. They approached E-Sassin to work with the
groups L.A. Rave and The Movement. At this time The Movement's single,
"Jump Everybody Jump" was charting on Billboard's Hot 100 so for a year
and a half E-Sassin was touring with The Movement all over the world.
"During that time I was exposed to many different music scenes and
cultures. That's when I was first exposed to jungle. Jungle at that time
had just broken away from the breakbeat hardcore scene and what really
hooked me on the music was the way it combined the different styles of
music together with a more forward thinking use of technology. The intense
drum programming and the tweeking of sounds pushed the boundaries of the
available technology, which to me made it possible for new technology and
programming techniques to be created just to keep up with the demand.
That's progressive music by any definition" By 1996, E-Sassin had made the
transition into producing only drum and bass. "Even in '96 drum and bass
wasn't too widely accepted in the States and very few domestic labels were
releasing any of it, so I decided to start up my own label".

Sound Sphere Recordings came to light and the first two releases received
so much positive feedback, it quickly established a high level of
credibility for the label and for E-Sassin's productions. Subsequent
releases have continued to elevate Sound Sphere Recordings, which has
gained the label well earned respect from both American and European
artists. Sound Sphere Recordings is one of the pioneering West Coast
labels to be dedicated exclusively to drum and bass and continues to be a
leader in superior quality domestic pressings and high profile releases.
Currently, E-Sassin is producing and re-mixing tracks to be released on
Sound Sphere Recordings and other prospective labels. Recent works include
re-mixes of Tha Truth's, "Red Lights", which is featured on the mixed CD
"Urban Jungle", for Priority Records, UFO!'s, "Enemy Infiltration" from
Thermal Recordings forthcoming on Sound Sphere, and 60 Channels' "Give Me
Your Love" for World Domination Recordings. He is also a featured artist
on the much respected album, "The World of Drum & Bass" on Formation
Records, which showcases some of the best talent from around the world.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)

The time is 1200 hours the date is 10/18/03 and the location is Pittsburgh 
PA.  The company that brought you a revolutionary event is now back to 
bring you the much-anticipated sequel to a phenomenon that began 1 year 
ago.  We gave much thought about how we could improve our event from last 
year and we decided to eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes 
brutal outdoors so we moved the legacy that started it all indoors into a 
beautiful large facility located in the heart of the steel city. We wanted 
to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of kind 
superstar import car event.  Even though we wont be racing vehicles this 
year there will be tons of fun, and many different creative things going 
on.  I will have to keep you in suspense about most of the activities that 
we have planned until the time is right but I will give you brief taste of 
what is in store for SO2.  Picture an event like you have never witnessed 
before lights, visuals, sound, lasers, dancers, djs, mcs, models, free 
stuff, contests, entertainers, many different automobile divisions, tons 
of cash prizes, a outdoor portion and indoor portion, and much more TBA!  
If you thought that Street Outlawz was as good as gets you wont believe 
your eyes when SO2 hits the city. So prepare yourself for an event that 
will once again go down into the history of the Steel City!

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
his outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its not 
magazines then its live TV the Freaky Flow combination has truly been 
just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.

incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Funkstorung

they kicked the shit right outta my head.  best show of the year without a
doubt.  fucking hell, they're way beyond next level hip hop/static/mindfuck
music.  they had some ILL beats and twisted samples.  i heard voice snippets
from ice cube, wu-tang, prince, bjork, and god knows what else.  one sample
was something like 'i can pay my rent, but i may have another head to
replace yours'.  absolutely TWISTED.  i cannot go on enough about how great
these guys were.

they both ran ableton live on their laptops and had a few pieces of gear
(kaoss pad etc).  it was hard to tell who was doing what.  they seemed to go
back and forth between playing some rehearsed music to just all out jamming.

what is really cool is that everywhere they have been playing they've been
asking local hip hop djs and mcs to scratch & freestyle over their music.
last night was no exception.  they're all about spontaneous collaboration.
it adds a whole new element to the usual laptop jock show.

honestly, these guys are way beyond 99% of everybody else in the world in
making music.  i mean, richard d. james would have a lighter in the air for
them like it was a def leppard concert.  damn.

THURSDAYS @ HAVANA
Tonight 06..03

[DC SPACE] - 10pm & 1am -  Brother Mike dishes out the deepness.

[INTERGALACTIC FAIRIE FUNK] - 11pm - 1am - Live House Performance
If you didn't catch them at the Memphis Lounge last week, here's your 
chance.  These guys have been touring all across the good ol' USA and are 
stopping by Havana tonight.  Mixer Magazine calls them 'a collective of 
costumed yahoos mixing hi-tech beats with live instruments, samples and 
distorted vocals - a "jam band" synthesizing the electronic with the organic 
so cleanly that the divisions disappear.'
Improvising on drum machines, samplers, bass guitar, microphones and 
effects, these guys craft their own unique brand of spooky house music.  
Check it!

NO COVER / 21+ / I.D. Required <--- please bring it or you will not get 
in!!!!
$2 Yuenglings and $3 Sangrias
and watch for the free shots at 12:30am ...

I know who this piece of shit is. You shouldn't forward private 
conversations to a mailing list. You'll never grasp the complexity of that 
statement with your feeble mind though.

I wish for mildly bad things to happen to you. Wouldn't want to waste too 
much kharma on a posuer/hater like you.

Well, it's in Pittsburgh, we got the place today.  July 19th.  As
before, just email me if you want to come, the directions will be sent
out 3 days before the party.  All that were interested in volunteering
DJ services, sound, etc, I should still have your emails and will be
contacting all of you shortly... all those willing to bring food, the
more the merrier... alcohol is the same.

Address any questions to me and I'll make a more detailed announcement

That's right ... I'm not going to be there.  and for the record - they 
called us we didn't call them.  Hey - free radio advertisements for a week 
... and as for the people asking for requests ... I'm going to have Vinny 
play for them since he has way bigger anger management issues ... he'll tell

Yes the rumors are true.  It's very scary for all of you, I KNOW.  Two
evil creatures like us, living and plotting our taking over the world
under the same roof.  I'd be scared if I wasn't me, but I'm me, so it
works nicely.  You never know what sorts of things Ed and I have planned

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} titonton tonight pittsburgh

Man you best believe titonton is one of my fav djs ever.  He always puts on 
a show, and he knows exactly what track to make you 'jack' that much more on 
the dancefloor.  Absa-freaking quality.  Did anyone go to rock the bells 1 
in dayton ohio, where he opened for dieselboy?  That was sick.  I know he's 
been around for years...but I haven't been going to parties all that long, 
only about 3 years.

Dang if I was in pittsburgh this weekend I would have hit this up, like I 
was dennis the menace shooting rocks with a slingshot and a good aim.

I am peeping this out right now.  This is GREAT stuff!  The tracklisting 
looks dope!  I will peep this out later once I get more time to really sit

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fuck, I need a hobby

Is there any chance of an mp3 mix? I would love to hear this, but I feel 
that Real Audio is a resource hogging bastard, and I simply can't bring 
myself to install it on my machine. I don't expect you would do this just 
based on my request, but there may be a chance you have it in that format 
too.

Yes, Titonton was the baum. I got there too late to appreciate the stylings 
of Kevin and Ed though.

July marks 8 years spinning for me, having started out w/ hip-hop.  So I put 
up a new mix of some of my favorite jams from around that time.  I think 
I'll have to do a 'volume 2', because there's a lot that's not on here.

http://www.djsoniqstylz.com/audio/class_six.ram

I'll put up an mp3 version for download if enough people want it.

Subject: {pb-cle} Track ID (Warning: it's a hip hop track!)

Ok, I don't know if anyone can help me identify this track or not, but it's 
been killing me for months now, and I figured that maybe one of you will 
know what song/track this is.

It's a hip-hop/rap track from I'd say between 6-8 years ago, and it has 
these lyrics in it:

"It's five o'clock in the morning,
where ya gonna be?
Outside on the corner.
You bettah get yo'self togethah...."

That's all I can remember, but that song pops up in mind so much lately, 
that I want to at least know the artist and/or title.

I can't find it on any of the song lyric sites, so can anyone please help? I 
know it's a long shot, but hey, I appreciate the help if you can give it!

Thanks,
Casey

Okay.  Here's a blurb that Trout can use for the ROM and y'all can use =
for your own reference.

Cook Da Goose III
Pittsburgh, PA - Saturday, July 19, 2003
21+ unless previous arrangements are made with me (a la tricia)

Background:  Cook Da Goose started as a renegade against the Ecstasy =
productions crew throwing Start and promoting the wrong ideals of the =
electronic dance community.  The proper things to amplify were the =
culture differences, the friendships, the music, and the way we can all =
come together and have one of the best nights of the year sharing the =
moment.  CDG I was a success in the fact that it brought together alot =
of listees that had previously not met one another.  CDG II was thrown =
because everyone enjoyed 1 so much and others kicked themselves in the =
ass for missing it.  CDG II ended up being a who's who of pb-cle. CDG =
III will be sadly moving locations from the 'Party Barn' where it was =
previously held the first 2 years.

What will be at CDG III:
Music.
Vibe.
Food.
Alcohol.
Boobie Touching (It's happened 2 years now, I can only imagine Paul =
Fleetwood will come with the mobile mammogram station)

DJ's:
Lemma (2 year performer at CDG I and II) - DNB - Columbus
Adam Ratana (1 year performer at II) - DNB - Pittsburgh
Soniq Stylz (1 year performer at I, 1 year non performer with poor woman =
management skills) - Breaks/Cheese - Dayton
Tom Cox (1 year performer at II) - Pittsburgh - tag set with yours truly =
which means something with soul and breaks.
Boompsie (1 year performer at II) - Cleveland - Techno (it's really hard =
to explain, but awesome to listen to)
Moose (1 year performer at II) - crAkron - Breaks
Osmotic (1 year performer at II) - Pittsburgh - House (he's running =
mango that night, so he's a tossup)
Jwan Allen (CDG virgin) - Pittsburgh - bringing something nasty.
Nick S (CDG Virgin) - DNB, trying to get him possibly to tag with Jea =
Leigh=20

there are others that I am awaiting confirmation from, but this may end =
up being alot of tag, but more than likely things will happen as usual =
and we'll be waiting for a couple people to show up and people miss =
their slots, etc... so also if you want to spin, drop me a line....

Oh yeah, the shit is FREE.  The performers get nothing but respect from =
those in attendance for volunteering their time, also much thanks to =
those volunteering to help out this year.

-Goose

PS Moose, hit me up bro.

I kicked myself in the ass for missing both of the first ones, 
although i was being a bit antisocial during those years.

I will of course be at this one since it is going to be at la casa 
de celestine, who will probably call me a whore numerous times 
throughout the night.  Should be good times!

Still waiting for the tire to RSVP, but quite likely the Cheat will be in
attendance.  And I don't know what Justin's talking about.  The Casa de
Celestine will be no longer.  Hey Justin, lay off the crack, or I'll have
to un-invite you.

I didn't go because it was at the Eagles Nest. Not only has the venue
been driven into the ground but its beat all to hell. 

Major shady shit has happened there over the last 6 years.
I have yet to go to a decent party there.

Great production! The sound, visuals, and music were all quality. The
turnout was bad. The placed seemed to empty after 2AM. Well anyway I can
assume that Wishing Well is probably done throwing events in NE Ohio.

Beat to hell?  You would prefer a broken down warehouse with no running
water?  Certainly you wouldn't go if it were held in a club that you can go
to every weekend regardless of a party or not.  Or would you?

Maybe you went to all the wrong parties thrown by all the wrong people at
the nest.  I fail to understand how a party with MAJOR headliner like
Uberzone failed to draw a crowd   If you don't party outside of Ohio, you
missed a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Wishing Well does top notch production.  Their sound, provided by 8th day
sound (the people that do national concerts)never cuts out except in the one
of the side rooms that someone else well connected to the eagle's nest ran.
They used proper intelligent lights, not some cheap martin product.  They
used proper visuals as well, dual screens, much of it pre-produced for the
artists.  They have never had a no-show headliner, and they have thrown the
biggest events in ohio in recent years.   They also bring djs you would
otherwise not get to see and who have not been here 30 times.  Not that we
don't have a great local scene.... but this was a $25 dollar party... and
you see $25 parties in cleveland the bring NO headliners.  Don't get me
wrong, I'm not a headliner whore... i'd much rather hear a TALENTED local
who is play NEW music and bringing a fresh perspective to the table... but
is nice to have one or two events a year that have out of town talent who is
not over played or typical mtv djs so that we have something to compare to.
Plus, Uberzone was a live PA, and how rare is that at a party these days?

So you are telling me we had to loose a quality top notch promoter who cared
about bring FRESH talent to the area, making sure that the production is top
notch, and caring what kids want to hear --- all due to the fact that people
like you don't like the nest and its because you want to too many parties
there thrown by truely shadey characters who did nothing to further the
existence of fresh new music in our area?   He lost $14,000 because THIS is
the mentaility of people in our local area?

The sad thing was, of the 300 people in attendance it looked to me as if
only 30-40 of them were from the northeast ohio area.  That is embarrasing..
Then again the same thing can be said about other events in Cleveland that
bring in good proper talent.  I guess the people who DO care will just keep
plugging along.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Se7en

All the energy and cash put into the event why not get a better venue? 
I am not trying to start anything and I am sorry that it turned out they
way it did.

Nor am I trying to bitch about your productions. I am just stating my
opinion.
The last time I went to the eagles nest there where about 200 people,
busted out windows, no I mean no ventilation on any of the floors except
the entrance room. So it was either choke to death on smoke , be to hot
to dance, or hangout in the room where no one was. Not to mention that
everyone seem to think the place to be is in the hallways so you can't
even move around. Completely empty dance rooms with 2k kids sitting on
the floor in the hall.

I would not prefer a broken down warehouse with no running water.
I would rather go to club then the eagles nest but would rather
something fresh.

Shit even the old skate rink parties where better venues then the eagles
nest.

Don't take it personally.

I almost went but the four people I knew that where going all backed out
when they found it was at the nest. I was not to thrilled about the idea
either and defiantly wasn't going to go by myself.

Beat to hell?  You would prefer a broken down warehouse with no running
water?  Certainly you wouldn't go if it were held in a club that you can
go to every weekend regardless of a party or not.  Or would you?

Maybe you went to all the wrong parties thrown by all the wrong people
at the nest.  I fail to understand how a party with MAJOR headliner like
Uberzone failed to draw a crowd   If you don't party outside of Ohio,
you
missed a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Wishing Well does top notch production.  Their sound, provided by 8th
day sound (the people that do national concerts)never cuts out except in
the one of the side rooms that someone else well connected to the
eagle's nest ran. They used proper intelligent lights, not some cheap
martin product.  They used proper visuals as well, dual screens, much of
it pre-produced for the artists.  They have never had a no-show
headliner, and they have thrown the
biggest events in ohio in recent years.   They also bring djs you would
otherwise not get to see and who have not been here 30 times.  Not that
we don't have a great local scene.... but this was a $25 dollar party...
and you see $25 parties in cleveland the bring NO headliners.  Don't get
me wrong, I'm not a headliner whore... i'd much rather hear a TALENTED
local who is play NEW music and bringing a fresh perspective to the
table... but is nice to have one or two events a year that have out of
town talent who is not over played or typical mtv djs so that we have
something to compare to. Plus, Uberzone was a live PA, and how rare is
that at a party these days?

So you are telling me we had to loose a quality top notch promoter who
cared about bring FRESH talent to the area, making sure that the
production is top notch, and caring what kids want to hear --- all due
to the fact that people like you don't like the nest and its because you
want to too many parties there thrown by truely shadey characters who
did nothing to further the
existence of fresh new music in our area?   He lost $14,000 because THIS
is
the mentaility of people in our local area?

The sad thing was, of the 300 people in attendance it looked to me as if
only 30-40 of them were from the northeast ohio area.  That is
embarrasing.. Then again the same thing can be said about other events
in Cleveland that bring in good proper talent.  I guess the people who
DO care will just keep plugging along.

Subject: {pb-cle} 7

so, i don't really feel like posting a review - but i wanted to make a 
few comments.

i have never been to the eagle's nest before. other than the nasty 
bathrooms though, i thought the place was pretty nice. uberzone was 
amazing, jen lasher was awesome - i liked the girl after her as well. 
didn't really catch too much other than that.

i hear people from ohio bitching about this place like it is awful, but 
i think you are just taking what you have for granted. same way that 
people here do with groove recently. i came out, listened to some 
awesome music, and danced with friends. fun time, i thought.

i have been to some awful places in my time - and this definitely 
wasn't one of them. really sad that anyone wouldn't come out to hear 
something as high quality as uberzone - among others, because of the 
venue - especially when the venue is not what i am hearing being 
described here. if the scene keeps having no attendance - then those 
fighting against it win. which means no parties - nothing. did you ever 
think maybe the promoter tried to get another venue? it isn't the 
easiest thing to do nowadays. and besides that - i go back to what i 
said earlier - this venue was not bad!

and people wonder why nobody wants to risk doing events anymore. so sad 
to hear the "reasoning" behind people not attending events recently.

Subject: {pb-cle} Friday Sauce (aka Soused!) review

Two words: TIGHT. NESS.

First a word about the venue: It's at the Lizard Lounge...the upstairs of a bar/restaurant in
Lawrenceville...and the place has a vibe all its own...you walk upstairs and it's literally
screaming "house party"...you feel very close, very connected with the people around you. Depending
on the types of things going down, this can be good or bad....for the type of music being promoted
and celebrated on these nights, the feeling is just right...

As I rolled in, Ed Um was stepping up to the plate to do his thing. Good selection, a bit "all over
the map" at some points, but towards the end, he dropped some freestyle sax solo over this
broken-beat record and got the place going...bonus points for ramping shit up for the headliner.

Titonton rolled up and started off with some cd-r business that was grooving right out of the
box...no doubt some unreleased stuff or a custom mix...having never experienced his music before, it
was hard to say what was his and what was wax, but it was all pretty good.

And the man likes to groove when he's playing. BIG BIG bonus points for that. He feels the music, he
doesn't just stand there counting and waiting to drop the next track. He was listening to what he
was playing and mixed as it felt right, not just as if the beats were designed to mix a certain way.

Yes, he did have some difficulties with the cd-r's he was using, but it was only a minor glitch and
he just kind of had to shrug it off and keep soldiering on...no different than when a record
skips...just kinda shake your head and keep on moving...

If I had to find a criticism for the night, it would be that the music was a tad too loud by the
time he stepped up to the decks, and for him to pull it back would've killed the momentum...which is
why it kind of sucked that the cops showed up at about 1:50 and made a fuss about the noise...there
was really nothing he could do about it...the precedent had been set prior to his arrival. It's
unfortunate that the buzz was killed in that fashion, as he probably would've rocked it for at least
another half hour without any interference...the groove was deep.

All in all, good crowd, not even a hint of shadiness or bad vibes of any kind (i think this has a
lot to do with the promoters as well as the patrons...though it was definitely a mature crowd), good
drinks (albeit a bit pricey for my particular poison) and great tunes.

I will be back. Sauce was a hit. Thanks to Kelly for the graciousness, and I'm going to take you up
on that offer. Let's talk about a date.....Nice to meet you, Christina and ALAN (aka Village Idiot
#2...per our conversation, is there really such a thing as a 'militant gay man'...i would think
that's sort of a contradiction of terms....)

Photo gallery (blurry and dark as it is) coming soon.

people would be over music like that.

Subject: {pb-cle} Dance Pass & Seven

matt and briri are men of their word. i love when
promoters do what they tell you theyre gonna do. the
venue was pretty interesting. some sort of metal shop.
people showed up about half way thru 7up's set, wich
was a relief cause i went on after him. people seemed
to have a good time, i did. i hope you guys have
another party soon, and book me :)

seven.... a great idea. uberzone gave me a message
with a happy ending. i danced to them, a lot. plante
moved me for a little bit too. moose played too early
for me to get down but, the set was dope. i never
heard jen lasher before seven. i wasnt really
impressed. it seemed that she lacked structure in her
set. some dude in the back room on the second floor
was playing some really good hard house. the blonde
that went on after lasher almost put me to sleep. i
heard two of zones records and split. i was beat.

it was sad to see where things have gone. seven should
have blown up. i dont blame people for not going to
parties. we all have our own reasons. shit, i never go
to parties anymore. i went to seven cause i didnt feel
like driving home from cleveland, and uberzone was
there. if uberzone came to pittsburgh, id pay to see
them again. and they could even play at a dirty
wharehouse.

pheonix rising should be better.

What venue would you propose?  The Agora?  A club?   We don't have many
options here.

This was not my production.  I didn't have a dime in it and Saturday was the
first I have met him other than online conversations.  I just respect what
they tried to do here.  Parties with the same headliners pandering to raver
101 mentality playing the same music over and over and over ad nausem (DJ
FUNK) are the reason people don't go out.  No progression.  If that's what
you want and that's what you want to chose to support, then please you do so
pal.

Every party is different.... its always the same kids hanging in the
hallways.

The skating rink is not for use any more.  I'm not taking it personally, I'm
just saying that it is re-tar-ded to boycott a party with great talent based
on the venue.  If it were a venue that raped you on bottled water and was
known to be shadey with shadey security in the middle of ghetto where your
cars get broken into... maybe you would have a valid point.   You should
have been boycotting these two-bit parties thrown with no headliner, a $20
cover, and 10 djs who all played the exact same style of music -- not a well
thought out event thrown by a reputable promoter.  A good host can make you
have a good time in ANY venue... remember that.  A bad party is a result of
a bad host.

Maybe if you would have gone your opinion would have been different.  You
just re-affirm my opinon that the reason people don't go out is due to too
many carbon-copy, non-progressive events thrown here that turned people off
the scene as a whole.

Paul, I'm not trying to be a dick here.  You're completely illogical.  Just
look at the flyer design alone... it is the best piece of work I have seen
done in a long time... that along with the stellar lineup of underground
talent should have been indicative that this would be something special.
Ask around, Wishing Well was known to throw some good events.  In fact, no
one really talked about the talent prior to the event... which is shows me
we have a long way to go.

Subject: {pb-cle} Our Scene - was RE: {pb-cle} Se7en

What venue would you propose?  The Agora?  A club?   We don't have many
options here.
--------
I guess all the club event I have been to have been a little more
"upstanding".
I have not been to "successful" party in a long long time.

This was not my production.  I didn't have a dime in it and Saturday was
the first I have met him other than online conversations.  I just
respect what they tried to do here.  Parties with the same headliners
pandering to raver 101 mentality playing the same music over and over
and over ad nausem (DJ
FUNK) are the reason people don't go out.  No progression.  If that's
what you want and that's what you want to chose to support, then please
you do so pal.
-----
That's not what I want in fact is was probably one of the reasons that I
didn't let myself even think that this would different. "Raves" have
been like that for a long long time now. Which is why in spite of the
talent I didn't let my self think that it would be cool.

Every party is different.... its always the same kids hanging in the
hallways.
------
That's the problem it hasn't been different. That's my problem that I
didn't even give this a chance. All my bitching (not on list) about how
the scene is all fucked up and how that doesn't make any sense because
we are the scene seems to have tainted me into becoming the problem.

The skating rink is not for use any more.  I'm not taking it personally,
I'm just saying that it is re-tar-ded to boycott a party with great
talent based on the venue.  If it were a venue that raped you on bottled
water and was known to be shadey with shadey security in the middle of
ghetto where your
cars get broken into... maybe you would have a valid point.   You should
have been boycotting these two-bit parties thrown with no headliner, a
$20 cover, and 10 djs who all played the exact same style of music --
not a well thought out event thrown by a reputable promoter.  A good
host can make you have a good time in ANY venue... remember that.  A bad
party is a result of a bad host.
-------
I have boycotted those parties. In fact I dropped out of the scene
completely for along time.

Maybe if you would have gone your opinion would have been different.
You just re-affirm my opinon that the reason people don't go out is due
to too many carbon-copy, non-progressive events thrown here that turned
people off the scene as a whole.
-----
You could not me more right.

Paul, I'm not trying to be a dick here.  You're completely illogical.
Just look at the flyer design alone... it is the best piece of work I
have seen done in a long time... that along with the stellar lineup of
underground talent should have been indicative that this would be
something special. Ask around, Wishing Well was known to throw some good
events.  In fact, no one really talked about the talent prior to the
event... which is shows me we have a long way to go.
------
I am not afraid to admit when I am wrong. You views and thoughts on this
have given me something to think about. I have been so used to being
disappointed that I have allowed myself to completely right off the idea
that anything else could happen. Your right I was illogical in my
thinking on this. However you are also right that a large
unspoken/missing piece of our scene has these same thoughts and views
that I have. 

What is the solution then?

Festivals.  Education of our peers.  When's the last time that anyone tried
introducing people to the scene?  If you're like me, it's been  awhile.
Find an event that you stand behind, then pump it up and promote it even
more than the promoter does... have some passion for the community.  With
only a few people really still keeping the passion alive, it's hard to get
turnouts.  People do support you if you have passion.  Control the Night,
from what i have observed, has this passion.  Titonton has this passion with
some of the sick talent he's brought into town as well as played out for
nearly pennies just to get the broken beat sound out there for more people
to enjoy..  Sauce sounds like something fresh that has the passion.  The
touch events..passion and quality.  Fuze has tradition, but i havent seen
them pushing anything for change/growth.  There are others that I know I'm
not mentioning, but you see, most of the scene is stagnant, with the true
heads mostly waiting for something to interest them.  Anytime you see
someone putting their heart and soul into something, it makes you want to
support them even more.  Pretty flyers dont mean passion, they mean business
promotion as done textbook style.  Face time and consistency are what grows
a community.  The joke forms of music are somewhat a thing of the past,
whistles, happy hardcore, cheesy hard house, it's all part of where we've
been, but it seems to have little to do with where we are going.  Kind of
like how old rock music was all cookie cutter, now it's diversified into
genres that were created by innovators taking that original sound and
improving upon it.  We need to take our cookie cutter raves of old and
improve upon them.  Flyers + good lights + good sound + headliner with
supporting cast just doesnt cut it anymore.  One of the best ideas that
really didnt do well in the last couple years was i believe 'Kick It'
because they tried something different, had motocross bikes doing stunts, as
well as a bunch of non-traditional things.  I still give them mad props for
trying something new, but it also meant they lost their ass.  This only goes
to show that you need consistency in addition to good ideas.  Here's another
reference, as fucked up as it is... but JBrick did the zodiac sign parties,
you could EXPECT one a month, with a theme based on the sign... now, if it
wasn't JBrick, i probably would have supported it, bagain, a good idea for
consistency and trying new things.  As delusional as he was, he still had
passion.  I think I've said enough for now, what do y'all think?

Chris and I left pretty early as well.  I think it was shortly before 3:00 
when we left, but only because we both were up since 6:00 Saturday morning to 
get ready for our wedding.  I wish we could've stayed longer.  I too was very 
disappointed with the turnout.

Quoting Doug Burkhart <dougburkhart@ameritech.net>:

I think you best not be bashin' happy hardcore, biatch. It ALWAYS makes people dance. If you have it at an event with plenty of other music, it's a good thing.

Just because it may make people dance doesn't make it not a joke.  If you
can have it at an event for 5 minutes with plenty of other good music, it
would be acceptable.  That's about the span of attention for HHC, cause
after that, it's the same fucking thing, over and over, high pitched voices
sounding like the munchkins from wizard of oz are performing an EDM musical.
Welcome to the lolly pop guild, get your E at the door, it makes the show
more enjoyable.

Okay, I'll take your word for it.  The next time you see a lineup with HHC
in it that you think I should see, let me know, I'll pay your way in, and
then you can proceed to showing me a good time and proving to me you're
right.  I have an open mind about most things, so if you see something that
would be the proper vibe to prove this, I'm all about going.  Until that
point in time, it's still just an EDM musical, with cracked out midgets.

Hey now lets not starting attacking the genres of music. Hard House has
evolved and chances are you have not heard anything innovative. It is
also blowing up in Utah, San Fran, Miami, all over the UK. The problem
isn't the style's of music more of what is being played. Genre wars are
one of the reasons the scene feel apart to begin with. 

Agreed the pacifier vigils have got to go!

For real start this my music is better or your music sucks because and
you lose all creditability.

Down tempo, two step, break <insert name>, to me just doesn't do it but
I am not going to tell you that you are not supporting the scene if you
have a dj spinning it. Or if you dance to it then it must be because
your wasted.

I repeat this kind of attitude is what started the scene's
disintegration. One of the reasons I left.

Festivals.  Education of our peers.  When's the last time that anyone
tried
introducing people to the scene?  If you're like me, it's been  awhile.
Find an event that you stand behind, then pump it up and promote it even
more than the promoter does... have some passion for the community.
With
only a few people really still keeping the passion alive, it's hard to
get
turnouts.  People do support you if you have passion.  Control the
Night,
from what i have observed, has this passion.  Titonton has this passion
with
some of the sick talent he's brought into town as well as played out for
nearly pennies just to get the broken beat sound out there for more
people
to enjoy..  Sauce sounds like something fresh that has the passion.  The
touch events..passion and quality.  Fuze has tradition, but i havent
seen
them pushing anything for change/growth.  There are others that I know
I'm
not mentioning, but you see, most of the scene is stagnant, with the
true
heads mostly waiting for something to interest them.  Anytime you see
someone putting their heart and soul into something, it makes you want
to
support them even more.  Pretty flyers dont mean passion, they mean
business
promotion as done textbook style.  Face time and consistency are what
grows
a community.  The joke forms of music are somewhat a thing of the past,
whistles, happy hardcore, cheesy hard house, it's all part of where
we've
been, but it seems to have little to do with where we are going.  Kind
of
like how old rock music was all cookie cutter, now it's diversified into
genres that were created by innovators taking that original sound and
improving upon it.  We need to take our cookie cutter raves of old and
improve upon them.  Flyers + good lights + good sound + headliner with
supporting cast just doesnt cut it anymore.  One of the best ideas that
really didnt do well in the last couple years was i believe 'Kick It'
because they tried something different, had motocross bikes doing
stunts, as
well as a bunch of non-traditional things.  I still give them mad props
for
trying something new, but it also meant they lost their ass.  This only
goes
to show that you need consistency in addition to good ideas.  Here's
another
reference, as fucked up as it is... but JBrick did the zodiac sign
parties,
you could EXPECT one a month, with a theme based on the sign... now, if
it
wasn't JBrick, i probably would have supported it, bagain, a good idea
for
consistency and trying new things.  As delusional as he was, he still
had
passion.  I think I've said enough for now, what do y'all think?

I think Hixxy's going to be spinning at WEMF. And there are always Hullabaloo's going on in Toronto. Both should be good HHC options.

WEMF tickets are half-price now ... get 'em while you can.

Okay, I'll take your word for it.  The next time you see a lineup with HHC
in it that you think I should see, let me know, I'll pay your way in, and
then you can proceed to showing me a good time and proving to me you're
right.  I have an open mind about most things, so if you see something that
would be the proper vibe to prove this, I'm all about going.  Until that
point in time, it's still just an EDM musical, with cracked out midgets.

Love.  What is love?  Love is the culmination of all the things you admire
about somethingcoupled with the compromise of accepting differences and
learning to like all the things you hate about something.  If you stop at
just liking some things, then finding things to hate, it's like you never
could fully embrace it.  If it's something you care about, even when you
leave, you still come back, and once you come back, you realize that you now
love it.  It's not necessarily that the scene disintegrated as much as it
may be that people could not embrace the sum of all it's parts.  I mean,
after all, it's based on diversity, difference of opinion, difference in
music taste, differences in promotion styles, differences.  At some point
there has to be some compromise from the patrons of the scene, and if that
doesnt happen, were the masses just there for the wrong reasons?  And are
you not still left with the people that love and embrace the scene, and are
passionate about continuing to grow the scene and share the joys they have
with a new generation, the next generation. Just my observation.

You seem like an intelligent, well spoken person. Don't get me wrong...I don't think any less of you

And that's totally fine. But you can't tell me that the things I said
aren't true for the majority of HHC fans. Again, you're the exception,
not the rule.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Our Scene - was RE: {pb-cle} Se7en

Watta tai my damie.

I posted this same email pretty mucha few months ago and was TOTALLY
blown off. A few years from now, I'm going to find it and get it put on
t-shirts. 

What you all seem to miss is that the fact that a "scene" exists and 
alienates people from going out to hear music and have a good time. 

HHC, DnB, etc., etc., wtf ever. Ask your average college student the
difference between Anabolic Frolic, Bad Company, and Moby -- it's all
"techno" to them. Upon handing a friend a copy of a DJ type mix I did
and a Live (yes, capital L) set I did, they were completely baffled as
to the difference. 9/10 people have no idea that a DJ plays records.
Really, I mean it. They think they're up there doing magic. I can't tell
you how many people I've explained the whole Infected Mushroom live vs.
DJ (you can see concept to and they STILL didn't understand. (You can
see Duvdev and Erez seperately, spinning, while they do the whole live
thing together). 

For this reason, I'll go out on a limb and say headliners really don't
mean shit unless they're serious headliners. True, you'll get kids
coming from a few states away to see a bigger name, but you could have
drawn a bigger crowd locally most of the time. 

As part of research for a ULTRA/MEGA type secret project some of you may
be privvy to, some folks and I asked random people what they thought a
rave was about. One really hot chick responded "People with tattoos and
peircings doing drugs". WOW. 

Is any of this sinking in?

If you want to get people involved in the music, seriously get them
involved in the music. I give Reaktor/Live&Reason/Traktor demonstrations
to kids (and adults). Can you imagine being 10-12 and getting a techno
lesson? Probably most of y'all would be pretty geeked about it too.

People have to realize we're all the same group of dorks. People think
that "ravers" and party goers are not the same group of dorks that they
are and in fact are (all) tattooed, body-modified genetically engineered
group of freaks that resemble any member of KMFDM. 

If you ask me how to "fix" it, I'd say start small, small events, small
groups of people (to break them in), etc. Since no one shows up anyway,
this shouldn't be hard. 

Lastly, someone made a comment about people from Ohio having nothing to
do but sit in front of their computers. Fact is, no one outside of a
select group of people has any idea what's going on. It's your job to
change it, or STFU.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Our Scene - was RE: {pb-cle} Se7en

I think perhaps the root of the problem is...there IS no sense of community. 12 years into the
development of the music, you simply CAN NOT expect people from all these different backgrounds to
come together under a "common cause" because their causes aren't common any longer.

I feel no connection with the music or the fans of HHC, Hard House, etc because they're coming at
the scene with different expectations, goals, ideals and interests. I'm sure there are fans of that
music who have no interest in what I'm doing with house, funk and techno for the same reasons.

That doesn't make me right and them wrong, but if we have no common ground to stand on other than
this imposed guise of "underground music", where in there is the middle ground to meet?

Look at rock and roll...it really took off in...what, 1955 or 56? And where was it 12 years later?
It had witnessed the explosion of the British Invasion, and had become something totally new, and by
1967/68 was SCARCELY recognizeable from its original roots of rockabilly and Black-Southern
blues...the "scene" was totally and completely different.

When I walked into Sauce on Friday night, I knew immediately that this was different than any "rave"
I'd ever been to, and that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. I felt more of a sense of community
and/or "common cause" in the 3 hours that I was in that converted restaurant upstairs bar-thingy
than any "rave" i've attended in the last 5 years.

Accept the change, adapt and move on. Stop clinging to this utopian idea that was destined to fail
from the beginning.

Why is ending the "rave" era and finding something new so damned difficult for people to accept???

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Our Scene - was RE: {pb-cle} Se7en

Utopian society? Different expectations...

Well I come to dance, listen to fresh and different styles of electronic
music, hang out with friends, maybe have a few drinks...

Rave's in the old term of the word are not only dead but have been. That
was caused by the ecstasy wave that devastated Ohio. But that is another
topic all together.

Rave now for me is just electronic music and people dancing without
having to chase tail around. However if your not open to music your not
used to then I feel sorry for you.

When was the last time you listened to anything fresh from any of the
genres. Maybe you just like pussy music (tongue firmly planted in cheek)
;)

Hey check out these sites for the shit I dig. If you hear it and still
can't get into then no loss right...

www.hardnrg.com
http://www.banginbeats.net/

Enough mixes to keep you busy till this time next year. Some suck and
some are hot its objectionable. Check out the recent stuff from Morgan
or CBR.

Half of a mix that I am very impressed with by Lil Nemo ... 
http://banginbeats.net/audio/download.php?id=24

When I heard this it was just the 1st half of a vs mix but it may have
been finished by now.

I think perhaps the root of the problem is...there IS no sense of
community. 12 years into the development of the music, you simply CAN
NOT expect people from all these different backgrounds to come together
under a "common cause" because their causes aren't common any longer.

I feel no connection with the music or the fans of HHC, Hard House, etc
because they're coming at the scene with different expectations, goals,
ideals and interests. I'm sure there are fans of that music who have no
interest in what I'm doing with house, funk and techno for the same
reasons.

That doesn't make me right and them wrong, but if we have no common
ground to stand on other than this imposed guise of "underground music",
where in there is the middle ground to meet?

Look at rock and roll...it really took off in...what, 1955 or 56? And
where was it 12 years later? It had witnessed the explosion of the
British Invasion, and had become something totally new, and by 1967/68
was SCARCELY recognizeable from its original roots of rockabilly and
Black-Southern blues...the "scene" was totally and completely different.

When I walked into Sauce on Friday night, I knew immediately that this
was different than any "rave" I'd ever been to, and that wasn't
necessarily a bad thing. I felt more of a sense of community and/or
"common cause" in the 3 hours that I was in that converted restaurant
upstairs bar-thingy than any "rave" i've attended in the last 5 years.

Accept the change, adapt and move on. Stop clinging to this utopian idea
that was destined to fail from the beginning.

Why is ending the "rave" era and finding something new so damned
difficult for people to accept???

<<I'm into HHC. And I can spell. That's a great stereotype you have

I'm not stereotyping. Everything I've stated is from my actual
experience.

You seem like an intelligent, well spoken person. Don't get me wrong...I
don't think any less of you because you listen to this type of music,
but in my experience, you would be the exception, not the rule.

And if you feel there's a stereotype happening, I really can't help
that...there's a reason a stereotype BECOMES a stereotype.

<<I'm not simply trying to be argumentative, I'm just defending the
music and scene (in Toronto, it's actually a scene) that I love.>>

And that's totally fine. But you can't tell me that the things I said
aren't true for the majority of HHC fans. Again, you're the exception,
not the rule.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: Our Scene

I have to agree with a lot of what everyone is saying (sorry, I get the digest), though I have to add a few things:

While I am truly, truly sorry for the loss that Wishing Well took with Seven, I have to question the good judgment of booking such a big party in such a small market. While I absolutely encourage thinking big, educating, etc -- I think a little more research and planning would have kept the size of the event more realistic to the size of the "head" market here. Before David and I started our Summer Series at Abbasso, we spent a lot of time talking to people, going to other events, sizing up what kind of turnout different DJs were bringing, etc etc etc...We would be foolish to book all our Summer Series DJs on the same night in a huge one-off expecting nearly a 1,000-person turnout as opposed to slowly and gradually introducing the sounds of these guys one party at a time. (Next party: June 28, Jerry Bonham)

I really agree with what was said about needing passion and needing education. We certainly can't expect anyone to do the educating for us. Those who know have a responsibility to educate. Next time you're playing out at a lounge or club and comes up to the DJ booth requesting a song, instead of getting disgusted that people don't know what the hell is going on, say politely, "I'm sorry, I'm not that kind of DJ. Here, come into the booth and let me show you what I do."  Carry a headphone splitter with you for the jack, and an extra pair of headphones. Let them hear what you do. Show them the records. Take interest in THEM. So many people think the DJ needs to be the center of attention, but really people -- it's the folks on the dance floor. I think the current state of affairs could be wholeheartedly blamed on the fact that DJ's have quit caring about connecting with their audience and are worried about being booked, being given props, having the best records, feeling exclud
ed from cliques, being better than XYZ DJ blah blah blah me me me me...Then they wonder why their dance floor is empty. I'm not encouraging the sell-out, but by all means, we have to balance our artistic integrity with not forgetting the reason we're there in the first place. 

To educate: Put charts on your site so people learn to recognize names of artists. Include tracklistings on your CD sleeves. If you have a friend who doesn't know the difference between Basement Jaxx and Thomas Penton, have him over for dinner and play music all night long, pointing out the subtle differences. If you're a DJ, hand out mixes to the random person on W6th street for the sake of doing it, not just to promoters from whom you're trying to get a booking. Look them in the eye and talk to them. 

And education is not just for would-be attendees. If you give a promoter a demo CD, include a response sheet and a self-addressed, stamped envelope for comment, and a business card with your contact info on it. If I'm listening to your mix and I want to call you about a booking, how the hell can I read your phone number if it's written on the CD that's playing in the player? If I think you have potential but want to offer feedback, how can I if you've not given me a way to do it?

Will offering more music guarantee more people will get into it? Dunno. I'm still caught in thinking that there may very well just be a fixed number of people that electronic music appeals to. David and I put a lot of music on our site --- our mixes page has had over 8,000 downloads!!!!!! PEOPLE WILL LISTEN...but this raises and interesting point...Have we had 8,000 people at our events? Hell No. Where are those people? Am I jaded enough to think that they're all just taking the handout, or am I optimistic enough to think that they're people not from the area just down for what we do? Too soon to tell...

See everyone this Friday -- ::TRUE:: celebrates the Great Space Coaster. 9pm-2:30am.  http://www.headrushmusic.com

so all that changed between 93 and 03 is a number? thats pretty
bad news to me. id like to think that 10 years from now what im
doing will be nothing like what im doing right now. 

>What gives?  your getting too old.  Its time to either drop out

youre giving a call to arms to stay complacent with what is given
or to do it yourself. that really doesnt make any sense. you can
do small things on your own at this point, but doing bigger events
is definitely outside the range of the typical person. i dont see
why its unreasonable for promoters who have access to money and
resources to be held to something of a standard.

Did you never like these genres of music or have you just 'outgrown' 
them?  I think there's a big difference between
1. never having liked them
2. having liked them but are now ashamed to admit that you liked them
3. having liked them but have 'matured' and 'developed' your musical tastes or
4. still like them today, but don't listen to them as often as you once did.

I don't like to pigeonhole myself into only one genre of music.  I like 
HHC, House (and all it's thousands of subgenres), Trance (again, all of 
them), DnB (but prefer the mellower stuff)... and on and on and on... I'm 
not out to make a listing of every type of electronica out there.  While I 
listen to lots of Trance so I don't kill people while driving my car, I 
still break out some old HHC CDs and other older music from time to time... 
it's all still fun to me, but in different ways than it once was.  Sure, 
there was a time when I danced my ass off to some HHC at parties and loved 
it.  But the point is that I have and still can appreciate all these 
different types of music, it's just that since there are so many continuing 
variations and mutations of these different broad genres, there is so much 
more choice of what to listen to these days.  Really, I'm sure there isn't 
quite as much kandy-kid HHC produced these days as say 5 years ago.

Not too many years ago, you could go to a rave and feel a sense of 
community.  Perhaps that was e-fueled at the time, but it was there.  That 
doesn't happen anymore and the younger/newer people coming into what are 
now 'raves' don't get the same experience now that happened back 
then.  Yes, they have different expectations, but they are also 
experiencing something different as well.  Good?  Bad?

One thing that I think about though is that, even several years ago, raves 
were a place where people from different backgrounds came together in one 
place for a more-or-less common reason.  There WAS an atmosphere like that 
there.  While I think that you could argue this utopian ideal of raves, it 
was a pretty interesting concept.  To now say that someone new who comes in 
today would have no interest in what you are doing is unfair.  Perhaps they 
might be interested if they knew where you were and what you were 
doing.  There is a lot to learn here and everyone has to start somewhere... 
but I think that those of use who might fall into the 'jaded raver' 
category (or some such) forget about those who taught us what we know today.

Those who know, teach... those who don't, learn.

I couldn't agree more... but if you step back and look at the crowd there, 
I think it was substantially composed of people who not only have known 
each other for some time, but who have been through 'raves'... sharing 
common past experiences is the only way to build friendships and 
relationships, right?

Destined to fail?  I would have to disagree.  Destined to change or evolve 
perhaps?  That is more appropriate, I think.  Everything and everyone 
changes through time.  Period.  That isn't a bad thing, but it is basic 
human nature to fear change and the unknown.  Whatever is next has to 
evolve... it's not like getting off of one bus and onto another.  Where do 
they go from here?  Raves didn't end, they just faded away for lots of 
reasons.  Every generation has it's own thing and until the 'next' 
generation finds its' own thing, we here today won't have anything to barge 
in on.  :-)

now we're hitting the root of the problem. and when you look at
this, it explains alot. the best part about techno and house music
is thier long lineage. nearly 20 years has created a community of
people with widely varying backgrounds and experiences that all
comes together in that music. the length of time that they have
existed really does make a difference in their established
communities compared to the rave kids who went to raves for 2
years and listened to mainly trance or hard house or whatever.
even within the house and techno communities there are plenty of
people with a background similar to mine having been involved in
scenes like the punk scene, the jungle/hardcore scene, the
experimental scene, etc etc. shit ive even run into a guy on the
313 list who likes this obscure crust punk band Code 13 that i
used to love back in the mid 90s. and now we share a love of music
with history, an established community. now this established
community gets alot of complaints about being "elitist" or
"closed" but i dont think thats true at all. because there is such
history, if youre looking for flavour of the month sounds and
youre ignorant of everything else, sure the people will be less
accepting of you. you definitely have to show some knowledge to
get "in" the club. but this is a good thing. 

as of right now, i feel especially close to 2 groups of people:
the house/techno set and the hardcore/jungle/garage/broken beat
set. and even within the relatively short lived (only about 10
years compared to house and techno's 20) jungle/broken set there
are tons of connections within the house and techno crowd. 

all im saying is that people involved in a less rigid less
established scene arent going to have the same common connections
that someone involved in the more established scenes will.

and then think about the stooges the velvet underground the
ramones and punk, all the prog bands, all the metal bands. it took
like 30 years to start to really separate into different sounds
within the sound. techno and house have almost that amount of time
invetsed already.

yeah no joke. of course i knew a vast majority of the people
there, but even their backgrounds were widely varying. the
connection was that they all know whats up NOW. 

>Why is ending the "rave" era and finding something new so damned
difficult for people to accept???

i do miss the idea of a rave in alot of ways. even though i dont
like to stay out that late anymore, just the huge party aspect is
something that is impossible to recreate in a small environment.
Movement satisfied this for me in a big way. it took most of the
bad points away from raves (too many drugged up morons, the all
night thing, the worry about it getting shut down, wack music) and
added alot of techno and live acts to a huge party. it was
everything ive ever wanted in a music event.

see this is what im talking about. theres nothing wrong with
wanting to hear new sounds and to socialize, but without the
connection to an established scene that holds things together, its
alot harder to have common goals and ideas with other people. 

>Rave's in the old term of the word are not only dead but have

i honestly dont think that ecstacy alone has to do with the
downfall of raves. i would definitely say the lack of communities
based around certain musics (mainly the cheeseball shit that we've
all been ripping on) had the most to do with it. that allowed
morons who didnt care to come in, feel at home doing tons of drugs
and not know anything without any motivation to be part of
something bigger. it made what could have been a community into a
hedonistic weekendlong orgy. 

>Rave now for me is just electronic music and people dancing without

when can you safely say that youve heard enough wack music to know
that you dont like it? seriously, at this point i know i dont have
to hear any more trance or prog house to know i dont like it. if
you went through the catalogs of the music i dont like and could
pull out  tunes id like, that wouldnt convince me of anything
except that theres such little good music in there that its not
worth me going out to hear.

youre also missing a big one: the music "progressed" into being

also i feel the need to point out the distortion in looking at HHC
that seems so common here. youre all forgetting that HHC was not
much different from jungle music when they both evolved out of
hardcore. they had alot of crossing over in producers and sounds.
HHC is part of the jungle/hardcore continuum, whether the
"hardcore" junglists like to admit it or not. any "candy kid"
involvement in HHC is now what that was about in the first place,
it was a reaction to the dark proto jungle stuff coming out, night
and day, white and black, yin and yang. i think both musics
started getting weak around the same time, and that both could
have learned from each other around that time. too bad. now theyve
both died and their slack was picked up by 2-step which is also
dead now BTW and now broken beat and (ewwwww) nu skool breaks are
the current holders of the torch.

like i said, i believe its because there isnt enough pressure on
the kids that were coming in to actually invest time and knowledge
into the music. that came from a lack of community.

theres so few people coming in who are willing to actually
accumulate knowledge. shit, look at the people on this list. the
vast majority who post have been into this music for a long ass
time and have a ton of knowledge and experience. how many "new"
people have jumped on here recently and then gone on to accumulate
a ton of knowledge and then contribute? not many if any. 

>Those who know, teach... those who don't, learn.

the "rave" kids werent willing to learn. thats the problem. they
were ignorant of anything aside from the most superficial aspects
of raving. 

>I couldn't agree more... but if you step back and look at the

>I think it was substantially composed of people who not only have

thats not true, sharing knowledge and sharing a common goal can
bring people together.

i think a utopia by definition will always fail. but the rave
scene's ideals definitely went away. its desire to accept everyone
no matter how ignorant they are is what killed it. holding people
to a higher responsibility if they want to be involved is whats up.

[i] love a good flame war.

OK, tricia...here we go.
1) Never met any of ya's, but judging from you and trout's "online personae", I'm sure I'd dig you
in person.
2) Had I met you, perhaps I wouldn't have that "stereotypical view" stuck in my head. My loss.
Totally. I'm a firm believer that people are inherently good, and I don't like the fact that I
dislike a certain group of people...any certain group (except racists...fuck them all...that's a
group I don't mind disliking).

But again, and I can't stress this enough...YOU. ARE. THE. EXCEPTION. NOT. THE. RULE.

The OVERWHELMING MAJORITY (hence the statement of "I have YET to meet a person....") of people that
I've met or interacted with on some level who I identify as being into HHC fall into the description
I provided. You and the other 5 people you mentioned do not. I'm excited about that. That means it's
not the music making people I dislike that dumb.

I made it fairly clear that this was my experience. And unfortunately, no amount of people popping
up and saying "But what about me? I can spell. I don't wear candy." can change that imperical
historical data.

Great. You're not like that. That means I probably like you or will like you if/when we ever meet
and hang out. Don't take it personally, because as I plainly stated, I'm talking about the peolpe
I'VE INTERACTED WITH IN THE PAST...you are NOT one of those people and thereby are exempt from my
statements and scrutiny. I'm happy about that.

I would have to say I couldnt agree with this more.   The ppl on this list DO remind me of soccer moms waa waa, bitch, complain, but no one tries to stop tha govt from doing anything and those of us who do are said to be contributing to a "lost cause".
 
Like Jon here says, either get involved or drop out.  I chose to drop out.  Matrix works ok for me, and if I really want to hear good "techno music" I have my CDs that never fail.  And no, lol, I dont own all Keoki or PvD discs.  
 
Heres to hoping when tha revolution comes (IF it does), we can have real "raves" again.
 
peace.

I can remember when we would be happy there WAS a party to go

Please consider joining the Drug Policy Alliance: http://www.drugpolicy.org/join 

Thanks for all the participation and input you've given us on the RAVE Act campaign. We're working with you to win the fight against this biased law. 

We understand that many people have concerns about writing to the DEA. It also seems that your faxes have either overloaded the DEA's fax machines or the machines have been turned off because your letters are no longer getting through. So, we've decided to shake things up at the source. Senator Biden (D-DE) - the man behind the RAVE Act - is a national political figure considering running for the Democratic nomination for President. He told critics of the law that he expected it to only be applied to "rogue" promoters that sold drugs. He needs to know that everything voters like you warned would happen has happened. It took less than two months for the law to be used against a political fundraiser and we're holding him accountable. As a possible Presidential candidate Biden needs to know that voters across the country care about this issue and won't stop until he repeals or reforms the RAVE Act. You can fax him a letter for free from our website
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=10425&l=2269. Copies of the fax will also go to the Members of Congress who represent your district.

It only takes one minute to fax Senator Biden: 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=10425&l=2269

Also, our new action alert is below. Please forward the alert to your friends, family, e-mail lists, etc.

You're making the difference!

==============================
*** Tell Senator Biden, "Repeal the RAVE Act"
*** Send a Free Fax:
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=10425&l=2269

Only two months after the RAVE Act was passed by Congress it has been used by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to intimidate the owners of a Billings, Montana, venue into canceling a combined benefit for the Montana chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP). 

On the day the fundraiser was set to take place a Billings-based DEA agent presented the venue owners with a copy of the RAVE Act warning them that they could face a fine of $250,000 if illicit drugs were found in the premises. The bands - most of which regularly played at the venue - were reportedly also approached and warned that their participation in the event could result in a fine.

Rather than risk the possibility of enormous fines, the venue decided to cancel the event. This blatant intimidation by the DEA was obviously designed to shut down the marijuana reform fundraiser. Unless the American people speak out against this attack on free speech, the DEA will be emboldened to use the law against other events they do not like, such as all-night dance parties, hip hop concerts, hemp festivals, and circuit parties.

Join the Drug Policy Alliance, National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, Students for Sensible Drug Policy, and numerous other organizations in our campaign to pressure the sponsor of the law to repeal or reform it. 

ACTIONS TO TAKE

1) Fax Senator Biden: http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=10425&l=2269
Urge him to repeal the RAVE Act or amend it to better protect innocent business owners, public health, and free speech. Copies of the fax will also go to the Members of Congress that represent your district.

2) Forward this alert to friends and family. Send it to e-mail lists and post it in chat rooms.

BACKGROUND

Sponsored by Senator Biden (D-DE), the RAVE Act (also known as the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act) was first introduced last year. It proved so controversial then that two of its original co-sponsors withdrew their support because they feared it would send innocent business owners to jail. Business owners collected over 20,000 signatures in opposition to the bill. Protests against it were held around the country and tens of thousands of voters urged their elected official to oppose it. Controversy over the bill stalled it last year, but Senator Biden attached it to the popular "Amber Alert" bill without public debate or a vote of Congress earlier this year and snuck it into law.

The RAVE Act expands federal law to make it easier to jail and imprison event organizers and property owners that fail to stop drug offenses from occurring on their property - even in cases when they take serious steps to reduce drug offenses. It applies to "any place", including bars and nightclubs, hotels, apartment buildings, and homes. Legal experts warned that the law was so broad that it could be used to shut down not only raves and electronic music events, but also Hip Hop, rock, and country music concerts, sporting events, gay and lesbian fundraisers, political protests, and any other event federal agents do not like. 

On May 30th an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) told managers of the Eagle Lodge in Billings, Montana that the Lodge could be fined $250,000 if anyone smoked marijuana during a planned benefit to raise money for a campaign to change Montana's medical marijuana law. After consulting their attorneys, the Eagle Lodge canceled the event.

I would have to say I couldnt agree with this more.   The ppl on this list DO remind me of soccer moms waa waa, bitch, complain, but no one tries to stop tha govt from doing anything and those of us who do are said to be contributing to a "lost cause".
 
Like Jon here says, either get involved or drop out.  I chose to drop out.  Matrix works ok for me, and if I really want to hear good "techno music" I have my CDs that never fail.  And no, lol, I dont own all Keoki or PvD discs.  
 
Heres to hoping when tha revolution comes (IF it does), we can have real "raves" again.
 
peace.

Thanks for all the participation and input you've given us on the RAVE Act campaign. We're working with you to win the fight against this biased law. 

We understand that many people have concerns about writing to the DEA. It also seems that your faxes have either overloaded the DEA's fax machines or the machines have been turned off because your letters are no longer getting through. So, we've decided to shake things up at the source. Senator Biden (D-DE) - the man behind the RAVE Act - is a national political figure considering running for the Democratic nomination for President. He told critics of the law that he expected it to only be applied to "rogue" promoters that sold drugs. He needs to know that everything voters like you warned would happen has happened. It took less than two months for the law to be used against a political fundraiser and we're holding him accountable. As a possible Presidential candidate Biden needs to know that voters across the country care about this issue and won't stop until he repeals or reforms the RAVE Act. You can fax him a letter for free from our website
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=10425&l=2269. Copies of the fax will also go to the Members of Congress who represent your district.

It only takes one minute to fax Senator Biden: 
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=10425&l=2269

Also, our new action alert is below. Please forward the alert to your friends, family, e-mail lists, etc.

You're making the difference!

==============================
*** Tell Senator Biden, "Repeal the RAVE Act"
*** Send a Free Fax:
http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/ctt.asp?u=10425&l=2269

Only two months after the RAVE Act was passed by Congress it has been used by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to intimidate the owners of a Billings, Montana, venue into canceling a combined benefit for the Montana chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP). 

On the day the fundraiser was set to take place a Billings-based DEA agent presented the venue owners with a copy of the RAVE Act warning them that they could face a fine of $250,000 if illicit drugs were found in the premises. The bands - most of which regularly played at the venue - were reportedly also approached and warned that their participation in the event could result in a fine.

Rather than risk the possibility of enormous fines, the venue decided to cancel the event. This blatant intimidation by the DEA was obviously designed to shut down the marijuana reform fundraiser. Unless the American people speak out against this attack on free speech, the DEA will be emboldened to use the law against other events they do not like, such as all-night dance parties, hip hop concerts, hemp festivals, and circuit parties.

<<Did you never like these genres of music or have you just 'outgrown' them?>>

Good question.

I liked old, old hardcore (92-95...things like the stuff first 5 "Speed Limit 140+ BPM" series of
discs). I liked ragga, jungle, and some but not all of what progressed into drum n bass.

I'd venture to say that SOME HHC is at the very least 'decent' in my opinion. I've given it a try,
and it doesn't interest me.

I can say that I wouldn't go to a party solely based on its HHC content...but I can also say that I
wouldn't avoid a party solely based on it having HHC acts.

<<I don't like to pigeonhole myself into only one genre of music.>>

And neither do I. It's far easier and more time-effective for me to say what I DON'T like versus
what I DO. I like a _LOT_ of music.

<<it's all still fun to me, but in different ways than it once was.>>

And that personal experience helps shape your views of the music and the associations you make with
it.
Mine, unfortunately, happend to be negative associations. And I have a sneaking suspicion that that,
unfortunately, has shaped my view of the music and the people that I see associated with it.

It would be one thing if I had never experienced it, like so many politicians and parents and those
'on the outside looking in'.

To transition from one topic to another...I've gotten such a negative response from a couple people
on this list, which I really didn't intend...we're so "on guard" to protect what we have, because
we've had to defend it so much to so many different people, that we've also started doing that to
people inside the scene itself.

<<Not too many years ago, you could go to a rave and feel a sense of community.  Perhaps that was
e-fueled at the time, but it was there.  That doesn't happen anymore and the younger/newer people
coming into what are now 'raves' don't get the same experience now that happened back then.>>

I couldn't agree more. It is totally unfortunate that my view of raves has been so skewed by
everything I've experienced from 1999 on...prior to that, I had a ridiculous amount of fun at the
few raves I attended. And I can tell you with a totally straight face that none of those had
anything to do with 'e' or any other drug (other than cigarettes, that is...but they don't quite
qualify as a 'mood enhancer' do they?).

<<even several years ago, raves were a place where people from different backgrounds came together
in one place for a more-or-less common reason.  There WAS an atmosphere like that there.  While I
think that you could argue this utopian ideal of raves, it was a pretty interesting concept.  To now
say that someone new who comes in today would have no interest in what you are doing is unfair.
Perhaps they might be interested if they knew where you were and what you were doing.>>

I don't really think it's unfair at all, Alan. Think of it as akin to a generation-gap. Newer
entrants have no interest in knowing (or perhaps no awareness of??) who certain people are or what
they're doing. They go for the "names". Not for the community.

And the "older generation" of ravers see this new crop and become disenfranchised because "the new
kids just don't get it".

Want some proof? Name the last rave in this area has been even remotely successful in terms of
either bringing mid-90's numbers of people together and/or being self-sufficient from an
organizational and/or monetary standpoint.

The community is missing, and the entire conceptual idea of the rave gets lost in the
super-mega-ultra-ness of it all.

People aren't going for the experience anymore. The genres and subgenres and micro-genres, the fact
that this younger generation I mentioned has entered without knowing the 'roots' of the scene, and
the general march of time and progress, have led to the fact that it's not going to be the same
again, and that perhaps it's time to move on and find the "next thing"...the next wave of how to
bring people together in this way, and perhaps incorporate the music and other facets of human
existence...art, history, sports...the possibilities are endless.

Too endless to remain stuck in a world where 'rave' is a bad word to those not involved...and
doesn't have a much better connotation with it's many current and former participants.

Perhaps the "market has been saturated"? I don't know. Perhaps the damage to the name of "rave" has
been irrevocably done. I don't claim to have all the answers. But there's something out there, Alan,
and I don't think it's such a bad thing to look for it.

<<Those who know, teach... those who don't, learn.>>

[sigh] I wish it were that easy. What lessons are we teaching? What are those students learning?

<<I couldn't agree more... but if you step back and look at the crowd there, I think it was
substantially composed of people who not only have known each other for some time, but who have been
through 'raves'... sharing common past experiences is the only way to build friendships and
relationships, right?>>

I agree with you. And, as I said in my review yesterday...everyone in that place came there with a
like-minded vision of how the night was going to go down. I don't think anyone can expect that from
raves anymore.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Our Scene - was RE: {pb-cle} Se7en

<<However if your not open to music your not used to then I feel sorry for you.>>

Don't. Don't feel bad at all. I'm very open to new music. I heard my first DJ set of broken beat
just this past friday, and it rocked my ass all over the place...

In reference to HHC...I've been there. I've seen/heard it. I'm used to it. I don't like most of it.
I made the decision.

That doesn't mean that I'll run the other way when someone's playing it. It just means that I'm not
into it and won't seek it out.

Hell, i'd STILL rather someone listen to my least favorite EDM genre than anything on a
Clear-Channel owned radio station.

<<When was the last time you listened to anything fresh from any of the genres. Maybe you just like
pussy music (tongue firmly planted in cheek) ;)>>

Hey, man...pussy to me and pussy to you are probably two different things....I like funky pussy. I
bet you like neatly-trimmed, hi-nrg pussy. It's all good.    ;-)

Actually...I don't classify music as "pussy" and "non-pussy". Only macho dudes and junglists do
that! (My tongue is so far in my cheek, I can taste after-shave...)

<<Hey check out these sites for the shit I dig. If you hear it and still can't get into then no loss
right...>>

Absolutely. Thanks for the links. I'm always...always...ALWAYS...down to listen to something new.

To my point about HHC...there wasn't anything new or interesting for me in that music, so I
disassociated myself from it. I found other things that interested me and I moved on.

Revolution - July 2000 - Columbus - 4000 heads

was a party, my friend.

I'm pretty sure those two made money, Revolution II definately made money,
charging a jacked up rate for a second class last second venue...

how about funky charms?  Don't know the exact numbers but they had to 
stop people from going to the main floor for a while because it was 
getting too crowded.  And I'll second the field day one.  Definately 
a party with the right idea.

Almost three years ago. How many raves between Columbus and Pgh since then??

Hey Traaaat, can you get us a figure on how many raves you've listed between 07/00 and 07/03???
Thanks.

<<Field Day - August 2002 - Cleveland - >1000 people paying donations... that was a party, my

And a cool idea. Wasn't it entirely donation-only? DJ's charge?? Again, something different!! I'm
all for more shit like this and CDG...

That address isn't right for everyone's information.  If you all wanna
come, make sure you sign up to Goose's list and he'll send out the
directions and address 3 days before the party with the actual location.

did you narrow it down to the months he was looking for?
i was too lazy to do that...   ;-)

anyhow, the trouts picks are not included, since those stay in a

Nope, its not anywhere near Dayton.  Its near a town in Southern Ohio 
called Peebles, its east of Cincy a bit, almost due south from 
Columbus.  Its out in the middle of nowhere.

Subject: {pb-cle} Venue matters?

{{ Doug Burkhart <dougburkhart@ameritech.net> }
Beat to hell?  You would prefer a broken down warehouse with no running
water? Certainly you wouldn't go if it were held in a club that you can go
to every weekend regardless of a party or not. Or would you? }}

I'm not sure exactly what point you're trying to make here, Doug, but I will
say this:

The "environmental" aspect of "nightlife" is VERY important to me, and this
becomes more pronounced for me as the years pass. I don't have anything
against the Eagle's Nest per se, but I can understand why people wouldn't
want to go there. Lots of bad things have happened at the Eagle's Nest and
several promoters have lost their asses there. Saying that the place is
cursed might be a bit superstitious, and saying that it had bad karma might
be a bit pretentious, but there is an odd sort of malevolence hanging over
it that since at least 1999, few promoters have been able to overcome.

At this stage of the game, I would rather soak in the ambience of someplace
like Spy or Wish. I could also go the complete opposite and kick it in a
dingy warehouse or on, um, like an abandoned bridge or something. Someone
should try that. ;-)

I think that if most people here had their way, there would be well
established, clean, properly lit, ventilated, and acoustically prepared
spaces that have all of the proper appurtenances of safety, convenience and
comfort that one would expect at home, and in these spaces would be staged
soundsystems which are sufficiently powerful to produce and transmit clear
tones of moderate to high volumes throughout the audible spectrum, and on
these soundsystems a variety of local and headlining talent would play or
perform quality music which is new and interesting, and yet has the
"familiar" biologically compatible rhythmic pulse that often sets the human
body into motion. The particulars of "atmosphere" are simply a matter of
personal taste, but as long as they are somewhat cohesive and harmonious I
would expect the populace to comply.

Yeah a WHOLE lot of wishing well parties did those numbers.  How many people 
came to rock da bells one?  That place was packed once titonton went on and 
once dieselboy came on the decks.  I just don't think everyone wants to go 
to an event EVERY weekend.  Not everyone has that kind of money.  I say have 
a party once a season.  That way everyone gets hype for it in advance, and 
have something to look forward to.  Keep the price low and keep it close to 
home.

But then again I am not a promoter, so what do I really know?  this is just 
from what I have observed and why I didn't go to cleveland this weekend.

is a bargain.

{{ Paul Kraus <pkraus@pelsupply.com> }
Not to mention that everyone seem to think the place to be is in the
hallways so you can't even move around. Completely empty dance rooms with 2k
kids sitting on the floor in the hall. }}

That used to never happen when there were chill rooms. Then the chill room
became the jungle room which ultimately sought to compete with the main room
for imaginary loudness awards.

Grandpa's Rave Troubleshooting Handbook says: Too many kids in hall ->
reduce sound levels to somewhere below the threshold of pain (130dB) in one
or more rooms. Conversationalists tend to avoid the earbleed section.
Provide seating and adequate lighting for flyer review and phone number
slash e-mail address exchange.

{{ Doug Burkhart <dougburkhart@ameritech.net> }
A good host can make you have a good time in ANY venue... remember that. A
bad party is a result of a bad host. }}

That's definitely one to think about, but I still stand by my last comment.
Space is important.

I will definitely concede that a bad host can ruin a good space, and that a
good host can make the most of a mediocre space. The best hosts know how to
choose the best spaces for maximum effect.

I think passion is important, but drive is nothing without focus.

I think Polish dills are so much better than the Kosher variety, simply
because calcium chloride tastes better.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Our Scene

Yeah true that.  I mean I guess some people do want to go to an event every 
weekend.  I used to, but then I don't know, I just got sick of staying up 
all night every single weekend sometimes two nights in a row never getting 
enough sleep and getting sick all the time.  And I USED to have a whole lot 
of non-rave friends but since I went to parties every weekend, they kind of 
labeled me a "dirty raver" and no one likes dirty ravers.  LOL..

Yeah true that.  If there are not any parties being produced then you can't 
hand out any flyers for more parties being produced.  And isn't it always 
great to actually have a flyer for a party rather than the .jpg file or the 
email invite?  I like pretty pictures.  [insert goofy laugh] [copyright 
disney co.]

Yeah that is true I didn't go this weekend because I didn't have a ride, 
didn't have the money, didn't want to stay up till 12 noon the next day 
because from lexington its a 5 and a half hour drive up AND back so thats 11 
hours in a car.  And trevor lamont and his girl amanda had a house party and 
I never get to hang out with them.  They also had a bbq and lots and lots of 
food.  So I saved some dough and got to chill with people that I hardly do.  
I mean it would be great to go to cleveland to check out the town maybe go 
to pittsburgh and hang there or something but that takes a lot of money and 
vacation time at work.  And when you are a pizza slut you gotta be there to 
do your proper whoring.  I mean pizza slutting is a LOT of hard work.  I 
mean you gotta pay your pimp, make sure you stay within your boundaries and 
you don't get on anyone else's territory and if some nukka dukka won't pay 
up, then you gotsa get bruce lee on him/her/whoever.

I kinda ventured off topic there, but I am tired and my stomach hurts from 
bad food...

NOTE to self: always read the expiration DATES!

Gyuhhh...

Josh, you always are the voice of reason.  When you put it to me like that,
it makes sense.  For me The Nest holds no bad karma, I was working every
weekend and only in the last year or so have I been to events out there.  I
do understand fully how if you have a bad time in a certain place you tend
to associate that with the venue and not the promoter.   It is a basic
recreation principle that once "the masses" discover a place of recreation,
it is time to go seek a new one.  One thing I do know... for every person
who says they hate The Nest, I hear two who say they love it.

Yeah, I heard from, err, eh, ah, a friend <cough>, about some gathering a
couple years ago one of those abandoned bridges.   When it comes to clubbing
I think it is fine to pick and choose where you hang out.  After all you are
typically spending WAY MORE than a $25 entrance fee.  When it comes to one
off events, though, I think venue rules should go out the window if the
talent is something you want to see.

No more dwelling on this.  I suspect unity would outweigh a choice of venue.
Time to keep pushing on :)

Not that this relates to anything, but I'd like to mention that the most fun I have ever had at a party was at the Eagle's Nest. I think toward the beginning of '98, a little party called "Culture Shock." Did anyone else go to that? That was the first rave I can remember being thrown at the nest.

I'm not sure exactly what point you're trying to make here, Doug, but I will
say this:

The "environmental" aspect of "nightlife" is VERY important to me, and this
becomes more pronounced for me as the years pass. I don't have anything
against the Eagle's Nest per se, but I can understand why people wouldn't
want to go there. Lots of bad things have happened at the Eagle's Nest and
several promoters have lost their asses there. Saying that the place is
cursed might be a bit superstitious, and saying that it had bad karma might
be a bit pretentious, but there is an odd sort of malevolence hanging over
it that since at least 1999, few promoters have been able to overcome.

At this stage of the game, I would rather soak in the ambience of someplace
like Spy or Wish. I could also go the complete opposite and kick it in a
dingy warehouse or on, um, like an abandoned bridge or something. Someone
should try that. ;-)

I think that if most people here had their way, there would be well
established, clean, properly lit, ventilated, and acoustically prepared
spaces that have all of the proper appurtenances of safety, convenience and
comfort that one would expect at home, and in these spaces would be staged
soundsystems which are sufficiently powerful to produce and transmit clear
tones of moderate to high volumes throughout the audible spectrum, and on
these soundsystems a variety of local and headlining talent would play or
perform quality music which is new and interesting, and yet has the
"familiar" biologically compatible rhythmic pulse that often sets the human
body into motion. The particulars of "atmosphere" are simply a matter of
personal taste, but as long as they are somewhat cohesive and harmonious I
would expect the populace to comply.

I went to an event 3 out of 4 weekends every month during college, and I'll never be that skinny ever again. I have money for non-rave-related stuff now, like curtains, and plants for my yard. It was always a trade-off. WEMF's gonna be THE TEST. I need to work out and build up my endurance before that; I'm so out of shape it's pathetic.

Well thanks for that amazing vote of confidence, Dave.

Hypnotyza's Amazing Computerfied Funknology Revival and Medicine Show will start as early as
possible.

I'll be rocking a very eclectic set of funk, hip hop, breaks, house, techno, and hair metal.


And i'm totally not joking.

I, too, have a pair of 15" subs.

Subject: {pb-cle} help elect a President who is against the Drug War


I'm going to apologize in advance for what might
be considered political spam, but I really think
it's important that the rave communities around
the US become aware of Dennis Kucinich.  Kucinich
is the only major party political candidate for
President who has taken a firm stand against the
War on Drugs.

If the rave communities want a President who will
scale back the War on Drugs, then it is critical
that Dennis Kucinich get the Democratic Party's
nomination for the Presidency in 2004.  One thing
that will help Kucinich achieve this is the support
of an organization called Move On, which will give
a lot of money and exposure to the candidate that
Move On members like the most.

Move On members will be voting on candidates next
week.  I urge you to sign up as a Move On member
(which is free) today, so that you can vote in
Move On's election next week.  You can do this by
going to this URL: http://www.moveon.org/pac/reg/

Here is Kucinich's stand on the War on Drugs:

"A safe, free and just America is undermined, not
bolstered, by the costly and ineffective War on
Drugs.  While well-intentioned, this misguided
policy -- which emphasizes criminalization over
treatment -- has led to increased violent crime,
misdirected resources of law enforcement and
restricted Constitutional liberties.  Despite
billions spent yearly on the drug war, addiction
is up.  Our country must rethink a policy that
produces many casualties, but benefits only the
prison-industrial complex.  Non-violent drug
offenders often receive Draconian sentences,
tearing apart families."

The rest of Kucinich's platform can be summed up
with these 10 key points:

- Universal Health Care with a Single Payer Plan
- Full Social Security Benefits at Age 65
- Withdrawal from NAFTA and WTO
- Repeal of the "Patriot Act"
- Right-to-Choose, Privacy, and Civil Rights
- Balance Between Workers and Corporations
- A Renewed Commitment to Peace and Diplomacy
- Restored Rural Communities and Family Farms
- Environmental Renewal and Clean Energy

These points are talked about in more detail at

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} help elect a President who is against the Drug War

I am in agreement that the war on drugs should be scaled back. I hate to 
piss on anyone's parade, but it will be an ice-cold day in hell when a man 
with this agenda is elected as president of the United States.

Sure, there are millions of people who use drugs recreationally. Many of 
these people are professionals as well. In my opinion though, drug users of 
almost any sort are about the least likely people to get out there and speak 
with their votes. We probably all know at least one junkie or crackhead 
(rock or meth) and I have never known one of those types to be politically 
involved. Of course there must be some, but this is what I have seen. The 
most widespread illegal drug used is almost assuredly weed. The funny, 
sitcom-esque scenarios that pop up in my mind when I think about this makes 
me giggle.

"Oh, shit. We were supposed to vote yesterday? My bad."

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.

Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

Phoenix Rising

A 24 hour Summer Solstice Festival
Music starts @ noon on June 21st 2003
Finishing about noon on June 22nd 2003


Eternal Youth, Visions of Rhythm, Time Space Illusion
& Flux Capacitor, the four companies
who brought you Phoenix 2002 are teaming up again to
resurect the Phoenix, even bigger &
more brilliant than last year.

Those who were there know what a great party Phoenix
was and those who weren't heard what they missed. We
are refining the event emphasizing the positive
aspects to make this one even better than last year.
With that in mind we are focusing more on quality over
qunatity(not that last years lineup wasn't loaded with
great talent). We are reducing the number of stages
however in doing so we will be esuring every stage has
atleast the level of sound as the most bangin system
at last years event. We will also have much more
intense light & laser setups on all stages. In
addition to visuals & some other very special
surprises.

In doing a sequel we feel it important to outdo its
predecesor, while our focus is to deliver a better
production as opposed to spreading ourselves thin
again. We still intend to deliver an event of atleast
the magnitude of last year, in order to do this we are
extending the hours of the event making this years
event a 24 hour festival.
Thats right Phoenix Rising will be a 24 hour event !!!
nonstop from 12noon saturday until 12 noon sunday.
It seems quite appropriate that the festival of the
sun bird begin and end with the highest point of the
sun while at its closest point to the earth.

JERRY BONHAM  (bedrock, renaissance, saw, spundae, san francisco)

Jerry Bonham, a pioneer in progressive, has been doing what he does best
for almost three decades. Jerry is a living legend - one of the true
beacons of electronic dance music.

Born in North Dakota, Jerry Bonham grew up listening to pop music from the
'70's, everything ranging from Barry White, and Sly to the Family Stone.  
In 1976 at the height of the Disco Era, Jerry ventured into Minneapolis,
where he began his DJing career. Later, Michael Graber, a Chicago DJ,
introduced Jerry to the infinite possibilities of mixing and live
composition, guided him away from simply being a mobile DJ. Instead of
playing only the hits like many fellow jockeys of that time, Jerry favored
the less-obvious works.

In 1988, he relocated from Minneapolis to San Francisco, where he became
engrossed in its local scene and fell in love with the people, the music
and the city. In early 1996, Jerry started his residency at San Fran's
super club Spundae/Nikita at 1015 Folsom. As the partnership grew, he
became co-owner of the Spundae Reckords Store located on Haight Street.

Jerry Bonham's DJing career on the dance floor skyrocketed during the late
'90's, his production standards paralleled the rise, hit after hit. In
1998, Jerry's first mix CD, "Interpretations," was released on Spundae
Recordings, followed by his celebrated 1999 release "Tranceglobalnation 3"
on Arcade America, one of Europe's most respected and influential
electronic dance music labels. "Interpretations II" is Jerry's latest mix
compilation released on Mute and Spundae Recordings. The CD was an instant
hit with 20,000 pre-sold copies.

In the recording studio, Jerry forged on to refine his progressive sound,
recording a remix of Expansion's "Listen" for the Texas based Funked-Up
Label. He is also part of the JSJ collective, also known as Jondi, Spesh,
and Jerry Bonham. Together, they recorded "Deep Love 9" and "Ghost of You"
on Renaissance; both tracks became the must-haves in a DJ's crate - two
absolute floor-fillers. In early 2001 Jerry recorded the single "Erendira"
(Spanish for "joy") with Planetary Consciousness on Bedrock. His recent
studio work is the solo track called "Seventh Seal", a 12-minute long
journey that opens with beautiful tunes and stripped drums, eventually
evolving into a complex web of progressive sounds and melodies.

John Digweed noted Jerry as a "world-class DJ", who "has been one of the
main pioneers of the progressive sound on the West Coast since the very
start, forever championing the latest sounds and pushing the music
forward." Dave Ralph added that Jerry is "the most underrated DJ in
America, who has real talent and depth."

Jerry Bonham has helped to define America's electronic dance music
movement with his flawless performances, and extraordinary production
skills.  Forever influencing the music, Jerry Bonham continues to love the
music as passionately as he lives and creates it.

Thu Jul 03                         KABOOM                            Canton

Universal Groove & Pipeline Productions present...

Kaboom!
A 4th of July weekend kickoff!!!

Featuring...

DJ Assault:
Jefferson Ave. / Fused
Ghetto Tech - Detroit, MI / Atlanta, GA

Born and raised in Detroit, Craig came to dance music like many of his 
Motown brethren, via the radio. Detroit radio jocks like the Electrifying 
Mojo, The Wizard (Jeff Mills' alter ego) and Chicago's Hotmix Five all 
made lasting impressions on the young artist. Mixing records since 1982, 
Craig has been indoctrinating people with his own take on electronic and 
dance music, which is very much an amalgam of his radio predecessors. From 
the Mojo's funky eclecticism to Mills' introduction of scratching to 
non-Hip Hop genres of music, his style is something that could only have 
come from Detroit. Along the way, DJ Assault was born. Anything is game 
when Assault DJs, be it house, techno, jungle, R & B or whatever -- as 
long as booties are bouncing. He has rocked parties around the world, 
including sets in Germany, Holland, France, Spain and throughout North 
America. Each time it's the same: When he steps up to the decks and 
unleashes that high-speed booty-shake, the audience has only one option -- 
to shut up and dance.


Annalyze:
Skyehigh / Stanton / Fused
Breaks/2-Step - Rochester, NY

Rochester NY's leading lady of 2-Step, Annalyze has been regularly rocking 
the Upstate, New York rave/club scene for close to three years. During her 
DJ set's, Anna combines an energetic stage presence with the hottest 
tracks in the 2-Step genre and the occasional break-beat track, as well as 
a bit of DMC scratching and turntable trickery, creating a vibe that keeps 
the dance floor packed and moving all night long. Having established a 
reputation as a constant crowd pleaser, Anna can often be found stepping 
away from the turntables, and joining the crowd on the dance floor during 
one of her legendary DJ sets.


Snyper feat. MC Enda:
GSP / Science Funktion / Subtech Audio / 4-Score / Still Vapor / Pipeline 
AM
Drum & Bass - Atlanta, GA

Snyper has been a native to the Atlanta underground for quite some time. 
In the mid nineties, spinning under various aliases such as "Jinx" and 
"Furious Stylz", Snyper aka Scott Thomas developed his skills spinning at 
various spots in the early Atlanta EDM scene. In early '99, teaming up 
with the notorious jungle dj Kysa, to form Link Productions, the duo set 
new standards in the stateside breakbeat hardcore scene, dropping 
mind-blowing tag sets all over the southeast that would go back and forth 
from drum n' bass to breakz with no apparent seam, hence bridging the 
"Link" between the two genres. By the year 2000, the drum n' bass 
influence took over and became Snyper's passion and main focus of 
exploration. In 2000, Snyper founded "Science Funktion Recordings", which 
became a collective label of extremely talented, up and coming dj's, 
producers, and emcees who ripped up the local/national scene with a wide 
array of styles including drum n' bass, breakbeat, house, hip hop, garage, 
electro, hardcore, trance, progressive, and everything in between. At this 
point in his career, Snypers style began to include elements not seen or 
heard thus far...fusing high energy, driving neurofunk sound with the 
darker, rolling, more abstract techstep feel, with scratching and 
turntablism techniques involved, Snyper has developed a very unique style, 
making dancefloors explode wherever he touches down.

JJ Boogie:
Fused Management / Well Known DJS / www.groovereactor.com
Trance / Progressive House - Cincinnati, OH
"GENESIS Tour 2003"

Don't miss JJ on this official tour stop. With over 7 years of DJing 
experience, producing for 4 years, and throwing some of the sickest Ohio 
events for the last 5, JJ has become one of the most recognized DJS 
around. He's played major events across the country including the WEMF in 
Canada in 2002, the WMC in Miami in 2003, and Live on the Decks 5 in 
Chicago and last year's tour sent JJ to Canada, Boston, Miami, Los 
Angeles, Miwaukee, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Nashville, Louisville, to 
name just a few stops. JJ will be giving away 100+ copies of his latest 
mixed CD - GENESIS 2003, his much anticipated follow up to last year's 
GENESIS Volume 1 CD. The GENESIS 2003 CD includes some of the hardest 
hitting trance and house tracks you will ever hear as well as JJ's eagerly 
awaited follow up production work to COMA with his "Big Room" remix of 
Solar Stone - Seven Cities. This CD is also JJ's first full release mixed 
exclusively on the FINAL SCRATCH System by STANTON. Don't miss your chance 
to get a free copy of this banging CD and catch one of the Midwest's 
finest DJ/Producers.

DJ D8A:
Buckwyld Entertainment / Groove Reactor Records
Hard Style - Dayton, OH

A Midwest pioneer of the new "Hardstyle" sound, D8A has ripped up floors 
with the likes of Christopher Lawrence, Josh Da Funky 1, Frankie Bones, 
and DJ Dan. D8A's sound is a hard mix of trance, house and techno grooves 
- filled with slamming basslines. On top of being a recognized midwest 
favorite, he also helms Buckwyld Entertainment and throws some of the 
craziest midwest events around. D8A will be giving away plenty of CDS and 
expect a high-energy dance fest as soon as the first needle drops.

::::::::::: Teknival (Technival):::::::::::

PLEASE SEE http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival FOR FULL DETAILS!!!

-a FREE festival of like minded people coming together to party, dance & 
unify in dissent.

-a celebration of DIY attitudes.

-an experiment in non-hierarchical organization and an attempt to prove 
the merits of a money free economy.

-an action of reclaiming space, utilizing public land that should be used 
by the public, but which often just sits there, unappreciated and unused.

-the creation of an autonamous zone. A space where the normal rules of 
society (both social and economic) are not applicable, and a new system is 
put in place by its inhabitans.

-an open invitation to all, regardless of lifestyle to get involved & MAKE 
SOME FUCKING NOISE!!!

:::TEKNIVAL:::JULY 11-13, 2003:::

Teknival, the name given to these free post society festivals by our 
European predecessors, have been common there for over a decade, 
reclaiming the countryside for all to enjoy.

Our teknival is no different. On July 11th- 13th, soundsystems hailing 
from cities all over the east coast of North America will be liberating a 
patch of crown land in Southern Ontario for a 3 day long, FREE, open air 
festival. 

 The location has not been released yet, but it is going to be in Southern 
Ontario, within 3 hours drive of Toronto. Exact details and driving 
directions will be released the week of the festival, on the website 
(http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival/), e-mail list and infoline

It is extremely important that people wishing to attend this event plan 
well ahead and for all circumstances. Please take a look at What to 
bring?, a detailed list of what you should & shouldn't pack for teknival. 
Also, please understand that as a community we must Leave No Trace, and 
respect/understand the plans that exist. Respect the Earth. If you bring 
it in, carry it out!

There will be busses leaving from toronto at some point on Friday, and 
returning on Sunday, most likely with advance tickets only. There may be 
busses coming from other cities as well. Don't have a ride? Help organize 
a bus trip down from your city!

off in the woods if you're so inclined, so long as you are respectful to 
other teknival-goers.

workshop area, set up a kitchen, hook up with a soundsystem, or anything

Sat Jul 19                       JEDI NIGHT                          Toledo

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Jedi Night
July 19th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring Djs:

Josh the Funky 1 - Chicago, IL - House - Funktion Recordings , IHR, Kid
Dynamite Recordings

Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, and
breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks.

In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In
the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at the
Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.

Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh
has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , "Bangin the
Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

As if his DJ'ing accomplishments weren't enough, Josh has also had his
hand in the studio producing tracks for the infamous Chicago labels I.H.R,
Kid Dynamite, and Strictly Hype Recordings. His tracks have been featured
on mix compilations and DJ play-lists throughout the world, further
establishing his reputation as a DJ/Producer. Josh has also lent a hand in
remixing for Chicago's number one house diva, Dajae. Her first single on
Kid Dynamite records entitled "Time" is an uplifting vocal anthem that has
received Billboard attention and has since been licensed to Credence
records in U.K. Most Recently Josh has re-mixed Dajae's newest single
"Everyday", also on Kid Dynamite records and already licensed to Defected
Records U.K.

Not one to be content with only producing records for other labels. In
2001 "The Funky 1" launched his own record label, Funktion Recordings. The
first release "Everybody Everywhere" by BSJ and Fun-K has found its way
into the record boxes of DJ's worldwide.

2003 shows no signs of slowing down as producers such as Santos Scanty,
and Jelo continue to churn out dancefloor stormers for his label. When not
in the studio or running the label, Josh is constantly touring the world
bringing his sound and skills together for the masses.

E-Sassin - Los Angeles, CA - DnB - Sound Sphere Recordings, Phunkatek
Recordings, Just Two

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran of the
Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical journey in the
late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and jazz/fusion bands which
helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. After a short stint in
the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to the electronic dance
scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. "Once I started getting
into producing dance music, I finally felt I was on the right track to
where I wanted to be musically. My reputation as a cutting edge producer,
and later as a DJ, steadily grew, and so did the work.

In 1992 E-Sassin produced and self-released a techno album which got the
attention of Sunshine Records. They approached E-Sassin to work with the
groups L.A. Rave and The Movement. At this time The Movement's single,
"Jump Everybody Jump" was charting on Billboard's Hot 100 so for a year
and a half E-Sassin was touring with The Movement all over the world.
"During that time I was exposed to many different music scenes and
cultures. That's when I was first exposed to jungle. Jungle at that time
had just broken away from the breakbeat hardcore scene and what really
hooked me on the music was the way it combined the different styles of
music together with a more forward thinking use of technology. The intense
drum programming and the tweeking of sounds pushed the boundaries of the
available technology, which to me made it possible for new technology and
programming techniques to be created just to keep up with the demand.
That's progressive music by any definition" By 1996, E-Sassin had made the
transition into producing only drum and bass. "Even in '96 drum and bass
wasn't too widely accepted in the States and very few domestic labels were
releasing any of it, so I decided to start up my own label".

Sound Sphere Recordings came to light and the first two releases received
so much positive feedback, it quickly established a high level of
credibility for the label and for E-Sassin's productions. Subsequent
releases have continued to elevate Sound Sphere Recordings, which has
gained the label well earned respect from both American and European
artists. Sound Sphere Recordings is one of the pioneering West Coast
labels to be dedicated exclusively to drum and bass and continues to be a
leader in superior quality domestic pressings and high profile releases.
Currently, E-Sassin is producing and re-mixing tracks to be released on
Sound Sphere Recordings and other prospective labels. Recent works include
re-mixes of Tha Truth's, "Red Lights", which is featured on the mixed CD
"Urban Jungle", for Priority Records, UFO!'s, "Enemy Infiltration" from
Thermal Recordings forthcoming on Sound Sphere, and 60 Channels' "Give Me
Your Love" for World Domination Recordings. He is also a featured artist
on the much respected album, "The World of Drum & Bass" on Formation
Records, which showcases some of the best talent from around the world.

Featuring...


D J B A M B A M
Contamin8ted / Jackstar / Topaz / Chicago
Experience the hard, jackin beats of the turntable intoxicator. Some call 
him Mr. Bigfoot, others a windy city wizard of wax, but most will 
recognize this sorcerer of sound as DJ Bam Bam. Utilizing his musical 
aptness, Bam Bam has touched audiences worldwide. For the last nine years, 
he has been directly involved in and thus accredited for increasing 
awareness and popularity of hard Chicago techno/hard house music.

J O S H "T H E F U N K Y 1"
Funktion / Mix Connection / Kid Dynamite / Chicago
A DJ for over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, 
tech-house and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable 
tricks. 1997 saw Josh become a DMC Midwest Finalist. In 1999 he competed 
in the Winter Music Conference scratching competition where he was a 
runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In 2000 Josh took 1st place 
in the beat-mixing competition at the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off. 
Aside from competing, Joshs passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which 
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh 
has also helped co-produce legendary Bad Boy Bills "Bangin the Box Vol. 
4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

M I X I N' M A R C
B96 / SHR Group / Logic / Static Brothers / Chicago
Currently dividing his time between his hometown of Chicago and gigs in 
such places as Cancun and New York City, Mixin Marc is requested by his 
fans time and time again. Not just an experienced club resident, Marc 
pumps the crowd at raves all across the country. Guest spots with other 
heavyweights in the scene include Dave Ralph, Frankie Bones, DJ Skribble, 
Richard Humpty Vision, Charles Feelgood and B96 jock Bad Boy Bill. 
Recently headlining alongside DJ Irene and Armand Van Helden, Mixin' Marc 
has received praise not only for his abilities, but also for his demeanor. 
A professional to the core, music is his life... and his passion. Now 
working into 2001, expect only the best from Mixin' Marc... and that's 
exactly what you'll receive. Top of the line bangin' club hits, a blend of 
rich trance with a touch of domestic and European techno.

www.poopiehead.net / www.djfade.com / Milwaukee
Originally from Madison, WI, Fade has been on the leading edge of the
Midwest breakbeat movement. Busy with two weekly internet broadcasts,
www.club246.com, and www.ravetrax.com, he is also one of the founding
fathers of Madison's premiere breaks night, "Magnetic" at the King Klub,
and the breaks buyer at Milwaukee's Trounce Records. Known for his
intense, bass-throbing breaks, Fade is quickly gaining recognition as one
of the Midwest's favorite breaks djs.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)

The time is 1200 hours the date is 10/18/03 and the location is Pittsburgh 
PA.  The company that brought you a revolutionary event is now back to 
bring you the much-anticipated sequel to a phenomenon that began 1 year 
ago.  We gave much thought about how we could improve our event from last 
year and we decided to eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes 
brutal outdoors so we moved the legacy that started it all indoors into a 
beautiful large facility located in the heart of the steel city. We wanted 
to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of kind 
superstar import car event.  Even though we wont be racing vehicles this 
year there will be tons of fun, and many different creative things going 
on.  I will have to keep you in suspense about most of the activities that 
we have planned until the time is right but I will give you brief taste of 
what is in store for SO2.  Picture an event like you have never witnessed 
before lights, visuals, sound, lasers, dancers, djs, mcs, models, free 
stuff, contests, entertainers, many different automobile divisions, tons 
of cash prizes, a outdoor portion and indoor portion, and much more TBA!  
If you thought that Street Outlawz was as good as gets you wont believe 
your eyes when SO2 hits the city. So prepare yourself for an event that 
will once again go down into the history of the Steel City!


ELECTRONIC MUSIC:
	(These are only a few of the major headliners that will be 
featured at the event please stay posted to our website 
www.steelcityracing.com for more detailed information)

DRUM N BASS:

FREAKY FLOW w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
his outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its not 
magazines then its live TV the Freaky Flow combination has truly been 
just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!




UFO! (Drum N Bass)
(Phracktel/ Phunckateck/ Phylum Recordings-SF)

The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!  Please dont be alarmed by 
the name the aliens are not really coming.  However this is just one more 
incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he his mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that 
whenever he drops his dubs the dance floor will be screaming for more.  If 
you hadnt had the chance to see this west coast legend then allow 
yourself the time to hit the dance floor at SO2 for an unforgettable 
musical experience!

AND MORE TBA!

HAPPY HARDCORE!

RYAN MATTHEWS-(Trance/Progressive Trance)
If its trance that you love then you wont want to miss this outstanding 
Pittsburgh native by the name of Ryan Matthews.  This young superstar 
tears up the dance floor every time he hits the decks playing an 
outstanding selection of emotional and heart pounding trance that leaves 
you in a state of pure euphoria.  

E-DITTY- (Trance)

fantastic very rare all live performance.  This is another do not miss 
performer that adds to our obvious love for electronic music!

TWO STEP

Cheshire w/Mc Gravity-(2-step/Warren OH)
We gave much thought to this and we decided to choose one performer to 
strictly represent the 2 step scene and this performer is no other than 
the one the only DJ Cheshire! Chris a.k.a Cheshire is a one of kind 
performer his smooth intellectual attitude gives his style a unique 
separation that blows up dance floors every time he hits the stage.  The 
love of his music is obvious with the energy that he displays every time 
he drops another funky beat. We couldnt get enough of this incredible

Subject: {pb-cle} Infected Mushroom

I really feel like going to Toronto, and I really feel like seeing
Infected Mushroom. Well according to the IM site, they're playing there
August 2nd, but I can't find anything about that on the Toronto Calendar
or anything. 

Anyone know anything about this? Or am I just a tool for planning more
than a few days ahead?

The only junkie I've ever known was a staunch Republican and voted at every
election.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Asian art appraiser?

Okay, I am REALLY going out on a limb here, but I'm looking for any suggestions one might have.

I need to get a Japanese Imari plate (circa 1700-ish?) appraised for insurance purposes. It was originally appraised at Christie's Auction house in San Franciso in the early 1970's, but obviously, that appraised value is no longer valid.

I'm thinking I might have to try the Cleveland Museum of Art and get suggestions from them ... I'm just at a loss here.

Thanks,

Amanda

Good question.

I'm bringing my own tent. I'll be damned if it doesn't have beer in it.

They aren't going to search coolers are they?

What about semi-automatic weapons?


What a horrible night to have a curse.

Dude, what? IRON CITY??!!  Tom... I got news for ya, Iron City is HORRIBLE.  I've lived in Pittsburgh all my life, and its a fact, much to all's dismay.  Tha only Pittsburgh beer worth drinking at all is OLD GERMAN... 
 
Yuengling is tha shizzy... but its a little heavy.   I prefer Rolling Rock.
 
peace.

Y'all song writers/producers should bring your unmixed (read: not mixed
down) tracks in WAV/AIFF format if you feel like learning how do do a
Live PA Ableton Live. I'll probably be there early, but won't be staying
too late. (read: fucked up shit that happened below).

I'll have my TiBook/Oxygen8, but won't be performing due to some f*cked
up shit that happened to me (loss of co-ordination). Had to cancel most
of my summer shows too, but mostly because they're way out of the way.
Blah. 

As far as IC beer goes, I'm certain that there are chemicals in the
water in Pittsburgh that allow people from Pittsburgh to drink this,
because they have it on tap here in CMH in most bar, and lemme tell ya,
I'd rather drink Milwaukee's Beast. 

I'm starting to wish I had a Guinness Keg Conversion kit (Nitrogen
tanks, valves, etc.).

Preferably asking people in the 412 to lend theirs so that we could use them for the duration of the party, not having to force someone from cleveland to come out early just to have decks there... Also, food and alcohol this year is pretty much donations, as stated before, this move to pgh is gonna clear out the normal savings i would have used to pay for food and alcohol.  I will be providing some, just not nearly in the capacity that I had before.  If anyone is wanting to go in on some brew (ie: keg of yuengling) let me know, if we get like 15 people that are interested, we'll just chip in 5 bucks and have that part taken care of.

would go wild trying to get some iron city. they loved it. those

lemme just point out when i used to take yuengling up to FRAT parties, all
the guys loved it.  THOSE guys know about drinking.  But fuck, we can buy
Iron City here in town, and I dont know a damn person that buys it.  People
actually take Yuengling road trips from columbus and drive to Washington PA
to get cases so they have enough for the month.  I dont know man, i wouldnt
take a 5 minute walk to get Iron City, but I'd be willing to drive a 5 hour
round trip for it.

thats just ridiculous. i dont know what to say. lack of decent
brewing must mean a distorted taste for beer. 

and ive seen frat homos drinking the silver bullet, dont try to
tell me frat guys know more about drinking than doormouse.

Subject: {pb-cle} ratebeer.com

    let me tell you about a great website called
    ratebeer.com - you get the opportunity to rate
    different beers on five different catagories: aroma,
    appearence, palate, flavor and overall. there are a
    number of interesting beers listed on this site, and
    for the most part, i have found that my ratings
    are generally inline with score of the beer.

    it's a free site, and i'd recommend to anyone that
    drinks a variety of different beer to check it out.
    whether you can hang with doormouse or with
    frat boys is of no consequense, as the site is free to
    all that wish to join.

    ratebeer.com rates iron city brew at a 1.63 out of
    five, with 86 people rating the beer to date.

    yuengling, on the other hand, received a 3.11 out of
    5, with 275 people rating it to date.

    with all this talk about beer, i think it's time i find
    my way to the fridge and pour myself a nice ipa!
   
    yummy!

I don't think Philly is in Pittsburgh, either.

Subject: {pb-cle} ITT

Sorry to double post but from years of analyzing both lists it's quite
obvious there are some that have their soul sets on only one.

Is anyone currently enrolled, have been or known anybody who have gone to
ITT technical institute? I just started my semester this past Monday. CNS.
Just wanted more of an insight.

Subject: {pb-cle} music ventures

I find myself going on music searches for hours. Allmusic.com is a god send.
I've spent months searching for a particular sound that one day I woke with
in my head, sometimes never to find it. Looking to expand.. no boundaries
(sp?); any recommendations?

stuff like epitonic.com
vitaminic.com

cheers

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP:  Tonight *PETE HELLER*

Tonight will be rare treat.  People know Pete Heller for his big house
anthem "Big Love" but he is also part of the production team Heller &
Farley.  From what I am told, Pete doesn't play out that often and this will
be a rare treat for Cleveland's music heads.  If you stop by the shop before
6pm tonight, I'll get you a pass to get in free between 9-10pm.  I'll be
handling the opening duties.

NRK's website, the label of his brand new mix cd 'Dirty Grooves' - nite:life
014, has this to say about him and his cd:

* * *

Heller has been a key architect behind some of British house's finest
moments, both as part of the Batman and Robin of acid house - Farley &
Heller - and as a solo artiste: 'Wild Luv', 'Afro Sleaze', 'Tweakin'', not
forgetting the toppermost of the poppermost 'Ultra Flava' and 'Big Love'.
And, as for remixes, well we won't even mention them because there are
simply too many. Alright then, here's a few: Pet Shop Boys, Danny Tenaglia,
U2, Degrees of Motion, The Source, Robert Owens. It's a long old list.

Dirty Grooves - nite:life 014 - sums up everything about the all-new, sleek
Pete Heller (he was recently re-designed for greater comfort and speed).
Firstly, there are the beats that are tough but contain enough funk to keep
the JB's in peas for weeks. They have been specially baked on gas mark seven
for an extra two hours to ensure your extra pleasure throughout the entire
78 minutes. A glimpse at the tracklist reveals the Murk boys' appearance
with their paean to drum addiction, 'Dark Beat', Sir Oliver's dark-yet-light
'A Deeper Sound', while no Heller mix would be complete without a dose of
his own studio medicine. This time it's supplied by Heller in conjunction
with New York's Tedd Patterson, with a tune tearing up dancefloors: 'Big
Room Drama'. A journey into rhythm and sound.

* * *

Do yourself a favor and do not miss this show tonight, June 21, at Moda!

Subject: {pb-cle} OT: network television censorship

I was just telling this story to tom.

Now we all know the hardcore censorship tv has; even blurring out trademarks
on clothes. Well awhile back ago Tatu, who are now getting banned in
england, appeared on carson daly's show on nbc (I was born in moscow
myself.. so there my bitches). Keep in mind NBC is public network
television. You don't even need cable to watch that shit. I happened to flip
to the channel and black letters on white, clear as day, there shirts read
"Fuck war" in Russian.

Just curious.. I wonder if its due to the producers being misinformed or was
it out of the assumption that the general amercian tv viewing population
wouldn't have the education to read a shirt in a foreign language?

What about NBC's policy? I think I'm going to write them just for the sake
of reading the response.
Discuss amongst yourself.

OMFG...

Has this shit been played to death yet? Aren't y'all sick of stroking 
each others little egos with piddly shit conversation regarding shit 
that doesn't have the slightest impact on you? Do you all have 
absolutely NOTHING to do but bounce pseudo-intellectual shit off each 
other in an effort to be "informed" and piss people off?

How about solving some problems that plague our communities? Why don't 
I? I don't give a shit, but I don't pretend to either. Fucking social 
commentary bullshit.

Perhaps people make mistakes? Why the hell does this story have 
anything to do with the price of tea in China?!?

Go get drunk, have some fun with some friends, get fucked and pass out.

Three words for everyone before I unsubscribe...

GET FUCKING REAL

Subject: {pb-cle} Havana

I couple friends and I went to Havana for bloody marys yesterday. The music 
was excellent, the drinks were spicy, and the servers were sexy.

It was a good time, but there were hardly any people in the place. I don't 
think this weekly should be allowed to just fade away.

Please help support it.

Tom says that I'm the default Kelly.  So you really only need to preface the
other Kelly's name with her defining characteristic.  That goes for all of
you.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} phoenix 2

Phoenix 2 was a good time. I loved the location it was spacious and
beautiful. I was expecting a little better turn out than they got. I
think they lost money on this event but I doubt it broke them. Had they
gotten a decent amount of rain on Saturday night I think people's
reviews would been a little different.  

Unfortunately I wasn't into most of the music I heard there. I did like
Rowland's set quite a bit though. But he really is a bastard. He stuck
his tongue down my friend's throat and she wasn't too happy about it.

Pics are here: http://www.pbase.com/rayge/phoenix_rising&page=1

Oh yea I was surprised by how many Cleveland people I saw there. A few
of them I haven't seen out in years.

WEMF 2K3 : PLAN B - *Official* update/venue change

Over the years many battles have been fought to bring
you this event. We have always been there to fight for
your right to party and this year is no different!
With pressure from the overblown media hype
surrounding the non-existent SARS crisis to dealing
with hypocritical members of the establishment, we
have been kept very busy in our efforts. To make this
event the best it can be and to allow it to happen in
a fully legal and permitted environment, we have made
some changes that we feel will allow us to continue
bringing you the quality show you have come to expect.
You spoke and we listened! Based on the overwhelming
demand to return to the beach, we have done just that.
This year we have decided to move WEMF2003 to a new
and improved lakeside venue featuring a beautiful
sandy beach, proper zoned camp grounds to which you
can drive and park your own vehicle, BYOB and have a
campfire. There is a fully licensed restaurant,
running water, showers, flush toilets and even an
indoor pool. The venue also features both indoor and
outdoor stages. Outdoor stages will run throughout the
day and evening and massive indoor halls will
accommodate late night beats. Not only are we offering
this improved venue but we are doing it at a reduced
price. We encourage everyone to join us as we once
again make history! 


New Venue Update 

WEMF Plan B will be held at Trudeaus Park in Tweed,
Ontario approx. 2hrs East of Toronto. The venue
features many improvements over our previous location
including: 

- On-site beach & forested campgrounds! 
- Camp beside your car as you can now drive to your
campsite! 
- Those of age can bring and enjoy their own alcohol
at their campsites (no glass)! 
- Outdoor concert stages for day and evening use! 
- Massive indoor halls for late night beats! 
- Running water, showers & flush toilets! 
- On-site restaurant and licensed lounge! 
- Payphones and much much more! 

Please visit www.wemf.com for detailed maps and
driving directions as well as shuttle bus schedules
and all other WEMF related information.

  WEMF 2K3 : PLAN B - *Official* update/venue change

  Over the years many battles have been fought to bring
  you this event. We have always been there to fight for
  your right to party and this year is no different!
  With pressure from the overblown media hype
  surrounding the non-existent "SARS crisis" to dealing
  with hypocritical members of the establishment, we
  have been kept very busy in our efforts. To make this
  event the best it can be and to allow it to happen in
  a fully legal and permitted environment, we have made
  some changes that we feel will allow us to continue
  bringing you the quality show you have come to expect.
  You spoke and we listened! Based on the overwhelming
  demand to return to the beach, we have done just that.
  This year we have decided to move WEMF2003 to a new
  and improved lakeside venue featuring a beautiful
  sandy beach, proper zoned camp grounds to which you
  can drive and park your own vehicle, BYOB and have a
  campfire. There is a fully licensed restaurant,
  running water, showers, flush toilets and even an
  indoor pool. The venue also features both indoor and
  outdoor stages. Outdoor stages will run throughout the
  day and evening and massive indoor halls will
  accommodate late night beats. Not only are we offering
  this improved venue but we are doing it at a reduced
  price. We encourage everyone to join us as we once
  again make history!=20

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} SUNDAYS @ Havana

yeah ... I was away on a trip this weekend and was away from Havana but I 
heard that there were hardly any people there on Sunday.  The owner is 
already talking to me about changing the idea of SUNDAY SERVICES to exclude 
House Music and stick with mostly a Jazz and Downtempo / Trip Hop music 
line-up.

The owner wants to make more money off of people coming in for the Brunch 
and not the music.  He's afraid the louder house music will turn people 
away.

We need more Househeads to come out and keep it alive.

or maybe I'll convince him to change it to Saturdays.

We'll see.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} SUNDAYS @ Havana

I am forced to admit, its the nature of the weekly, rather than the specific 
programming that makes me want to be there. I have always liked house music, 
but the jazz/downtempo lineup may actually appeal to me even more.

The environment was great, but when you're trying to keep doors open in an 
expensive place like shadyside, I guess the finances have to dictate a 
little bit about what you choose to do.

You'll see me there again, regardless of which music choice you settle on. 
Props, once again.

Ben

as cool as i think macs are, i think apple is misleading its customers
with this ad.  sun microsystems is in the same boat (but they are
putting the empasis on "throughput computing").  just because a chip is
64-bit doesn't mean its twice as fast.  it means that its capable of
addressing a larger memory space and working with larger numbers.  this
means that a 64-bit chip is going to be faster than a 32-bit chip
running something like oracle on 8 gigs of ram, but its certainly not
going to make word any faster.  the g5 might beat a p4 3ghz in very
specific areas (non-linear video editing is another example), but for
most people, you can't beat raw mhz.

heres an article that made slashdot today that examines apples skewed
benchmarks in detail:

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} SUNDAYS @ Havana

Megan (720) and I were down on sunday checking out the sounds, and 
we had a lovely time. The new menu is excellent. We had the fruit 
platter and the baked plaintin w/black bean dip and salsa, and 
both dishes were excellent! Maybe next sunday i'll get the 
choclate chip pancakes with pineapple syrup. i highly recommend 
this event to everyone who likes to sleep in on sunday and usually 
miss the brunch special at your local eatery.

jw

ps and the music is good too:)

Wow, dudes got it down to the nano second, way too much time on the hands.  its a pissing match.  but its obvious to users of both platforms that the Unix/Mac is MUCH more stable to work in.  my PC running 2k is a burden working in audio apps.

Subject: {pb-cle} this Saturday -- Bonham

For those who don't know Jerry Bonham or his music, come to skool. Here are
some opinions of him from elsewhere, most notably:

"...bonham is responsible for one of the best nights of music i've heard --
actually was at the San Fran Spundae party that Sasha's GU009 cd was based
on. people will jump all over this, but Bonham outplayed sasha that night --
kept Major North's 'Annihilate' running underneath about six straight tracks
as additional percussion -- really an amazing dj, and one who clearly
doesn't get enough credit."
http://pub129.ezboard.com/fglobalundergroundfrm25.showMessage?topicID=15047.
topic

I don't know too many people who come to Cleveland who are said to outplay
Sasha, and who John Digweed himself calls "One of the pioneers of the
progressive sound."  June 28 -- This Saturday. All the info on our site at
http://www.headrushmusic.com on on Trout's rave-o-matic. See you there.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} PowerMac G5 is out.

Are you really having so much trouble with word going slowly that you need 
to buy top of the line, cutting edge computers?  This system is being  
marketed to people that nee dprocessing power- and as opposed to PC's, where 
processing power is mostly marketed towards gamers, High-powered macs are 
markedted towards creative professionals.  The people that do a lot of work 
with photoshop, logic, maya, etc etc are the ones who are going to buy G5's. 
  Those that like apples and want to do word processing will be perfectly 
happy with an iMac...

And nobody noticed when I pointed out that beautiful Max/MSP/Jitter plugin 
that lets you use vinyl to control pretty much anything.  That's some stuff 
you need processing power for. :)

Oh, man...I ABSOLUTELY saw that jitter thing you sent, and sat there and drooled over it....

Considering what I saw DJ Shadow do with his MPC sampler and the laptops his visuals guy was running
back in November, I have no doubt that he'll be up on this very soon, if he's not already.

For those that missed it-
http://www.cycling74.com/products/mspinky.html

Lets you use turntables to control audio, video, synth parameters, or 
anything else you can control.  You could probably set it up to have your 
two turntables act as x-y joystick controllers, so you could play some quake 
3 with your tech 12's.. :)

And right now it's macintosh only....

Max in itself is fuckin cool.  This place pumps out some amazing software, 
you all should just surf around.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} pheonix 2

i chilled with lisa till like monday night. i didnt mess my truck up, but my 
service engine soon light came on. prolly from gunning it in 2nd gear the 
whole way up the hill. no matter how much planning you do when throwing any 
kind of party, theres always more you can do. i think that things went as 
good as they couldve possible gone, because you cant control the rain or 
crazy people and that would be my only complaint(aside from minor details). 
but then again it wouldnt be a true outdoor party without a little rain. i 
cant remember going to one that it didnt rain at. you shoulda brought a 
flashlight for the rough dark terrain. they couldve put the stage i played 
on in a better place, cause so many people couldnt even find it, but its a 
little hard to move a whole stage after you realize its in a bad place.

not really the forum, but eh oh well...

read up on the benchmarks....
http://www.haxial.com/spls-soapbox/apple-powermac-G5/

benchmarks are being terribly abused as of late, ATI and Nvidia have 
been busted on it recently, so i take ANY benchmark with a grain of salt....

-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Residual Recordings + Headroom Digital present

>>>PENETRATE>>>

Friday, June 27th, 2003 @ Standard Lounge


Featuring:


>>>>>>Daz-I-Kue

Bugz in the Attic / Bittasweet / MAW / Laws of Motion / People / London
Perhaps the most important member of the infamous and influential Bugz in
the Attic collective, Daz-I-Kue has shaped and defined the sound known as
Broken Beat.  As the main recording and mix engineer for all Bugz in the
Attic productions and at their BitaSuite recording studio his ear and
skills determine the outcome of all Bugz in the Attic productions.  He is
also a highly regarded producer, contributing heavily to all the Bugz in
the Attic projects including the amazing Afronaught and Agent K LPs while
also putting out his own productions and producing other acclaimed acts.
Producing tracks as Bugz in the Attic as well as under various other
guises such as The Sinclair Project, BB Boogie, Blak Label Blend, Da Ends,
Misa Negra, and Ladbroke Groovers to name just a few, Daz-I-Kue has earned
his place among the upper echelons of electronic music.

In addition to his own production work, Daz-I-Kue is an in-demand remix
artist.  While he has done remixes for fellow Bugz in the Attic members,
Daz-I-Kues reputation has given him the opportunity to remix other
artists as well including the well known German group Jazzanova, Fela for
the "Red Hot and Riot" Fela tribute LP, 4Hero, Vikter Duplaix, Delano
Smith, Zero 7, and Gaelle on the massive Naked Music imprint.  Most
recently, he has just finished a remix of Macy Grays "When I See You"
that is set for release by Sony Music.  Between all of his studio work,
Daz-I-Kue manages to find time to maintain a healthy DJ career as well
with recent appearances in Berlin, Prague, Edinburgh, Sheffield, and at
the legendary Co-Op night in London. We are pleased to bring Daz-I-Kue to
Penetrate for his debut Midwest appearance.


>>>>Titonton Duvant

Residual / Bittasweet / 2000 Black  / Jazzanova Compost / Visions
 Fresh back from his 18th tour of Europe, Titonton Duvant continues to
expand his reputation as an innovator and a Columbus based ambassador of
electronic music to the world.  Mr. Duvant has over 35 releases,
including two full length albums, on labels such as UK based 2000 Black
and Visions, as well as the Italian label Archive, and his own Residual
Recordings, to name just a few.  He has recently been signed to Bitasweet,
the Bugz in the Attic label based in London.  He is also a new member of
the Jazzanova Compost label artist roster and recently remixed "Let it
go," the second single off of the freshly released Rima album "This
World."  He is currently hard at work on his third full length album,
"Perversions." In addition to production, Mr. Duvant is renown as a top
notch performer, earning him the honor of being the first American DJ to
have performed at the definitive Broken Beat night, Co-op, in London.  
Junes Penetrate will be the last stop on a 14-day US tour for Mr. Duvant
with other stops including Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and
Seattle.  It will also be one of the last opportunities to catch him
performing before he travels to France to study for the summer while
performing on the weekends in Spain, England, and for the first time in
Scotland and Finland.


>>Douglas Black

Headroom Digital / Proceed
 Douglas Black is cofounder of the Midwest event production group and
artist cooperative Headroom Digital and a seasoned promoter and DJ.  He is

JERRY BONHAM  (bedrock, renaissance, saw, spundae, san francisco)

Jerry Bonham, a pioneer in progressive, has been doing what he does best
for almost three decades. Jerry is a living legend - one of the true
beacons of electronic dance music.

Born in North Dakota, Jerry Bonham grew up listening to pop music from the
'70's, everything ranging from Barry White, and Sly to the Family Stone.  
In 1976 at the height of the Disco Era, Jerry ventured into Minneapolis,
where he began his DJing career. Later, Michael Graber, a Chicago DJ,
introduced Jerry to the infinite possibilities of mixing and live
composition, guided him away from simply being a mobile DJ. Instead of
playing only the hits like many fellow jockeys of that time, Jerry favored
the less-obvious works.

In 1988, he relocated from Minneapolis to San Francisco, where he became
engrossed in its local scene and fell in love with the people, the music
and the city. In early 1996, Jerry started his residency at San Fran's
super club Spundae/Nikita at 1015 Folsom. As the partnership grew, he
became co-owner of the Spundae Reckords Store located on Haight Street.

Jerry Bonham's DJing career on the dance floor skyrocketed during the late
'90's, his production standards paralleled the rise, hit after hit. In
1998, Jerry's first mix CD, "Interpretations," was released on Spundae
Recordings, followed by his celebrated 1999 release "Tranceglobalnation 3"
on Arcade America, one of Europe's most respected and influential
electronic dance music labels. "Interpretations II" is Jerry's latest mix
compilation released on Mute and Spundae Recordings. The CD was an instant
hit with 20,000 pre-sold copies.

In the recording studio, Jerry forged on to refine his progressive sound,
recording a remix of Expansion's "Listen" for the Texas based Funked-Up
Label. He is also part of the JSJ collective, also known as Jondi, Spesh,
and Jerry Bonham. Together, they recorded "Deep Love 9" and "Ghost of You"
on Renaissance; both tracks became the must-haves in a DJ's crate - two
absolute floor-fillers. In early 2001 Jerry recorded the single "Erendira"
(Spanish for "joy") with Planetary Consciousness on Bedrock. His recent
studio work is the solo track called "Seventh Seal", a 12-minute long
journey that opens with beautiful tunes and stripped drums, eventually
evolving into a complex web of progressive sounds and melodies.

John Digweed noted Jerry as a "world-class DJ", who "has been one of the
main pioneers of the progressive sound on the West Coast since the very
start, forever championing the latest sounds and pushing the music
forward." Dave Ralph added that Jerry is "the most underrated DJ in
America, who has real talent and depth."

Jerry Bonham has helped to define America's electronic dance music
movement with his flawless performances, and extraordinary production
skills.  Forever influencing the music, Jerry Bonham continues to love the
music as passionately as he lives and creates it.

::::::::::: Teknival (Technival):::::::::::

PLEASE SEE http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival FOR FULL DETAILS!!!

-a FREE festival of like minded people coming together to party, dance & 
unify in dissent.

-a celebration of DIY attitudes.

-an experiment in non-hierarchical organization and an attempt to prove 
the merits of a money free economy.

-an action of reclaiming space, utilizing public land that should be used 
by the public, but which often just sits there, unappreciated and unused.

-the creation of an autonamous zone. A space where the normal rules of 
society (both social and economic) are not applicable, and a new system is 
put in place by its inhabitans.

-an open invitation to all, regardless of lifestyle to get involved & MAKE 
SOME FUCKING NOISE!!!

:::TEKNIVAL:::JULY 11-13, 2003:::

Teknival, the name given to these free post society festivals by our 
European predecessors, have been common there for over a decade, 
reclaiming the countryside for all to enjoy.

Our teknival is no different. On July 11th- 13th, soundsystems hailing 
from cities all over the east coast of North America will be liberating a 
patch of crown land in Southern Ontario for a 3 day long, FREE, open air 
festival. 

 The location has not been released yet, but it is going to be in Southern 
Ontario, within 3 hours drive of Toronto. Exact details and driving 
directions will be released the week of the festival, on the website 
(http://freetekno.toronto.on.ca/2003teknival/), e-mail list and infoline

It is extremely important that people wishing to attend this event plan 
well ahead and for all circumstances. Please take a look at What to 
bring?, a detailed list of what you should & shouldn't pack for teknival. 
Also, please understand that as a community we must Leave No Trace, and 
respect/understand the plans that exist. Respect the Earth. If you bring 
it in, carry it out!

There will be busses leaving from toronto at some point on Friday, and 
returning on Sunday, most likely with advance tickets only. There may be 
busses coming from other cities as well. Don't have a ride? Help organize 
a bus trip down from your city!

off in the woods if you're so inclined, so long as you are respectful to 
other teknival-goers.

Sat Jul 19                  COOK NUBIAN STRONGBAD                Gooseburgh

Cook Da Goose III
Pittsburgh, PA - Saturday, July 19, 2003
21+ unless previous arrangements are made with me (a la tricia)

Background:  Cook Da Goose started as a renegade against the Ecstasy 
productions crew throwing Start and promoting the wrong ideals of the 
electronic dance community.  The proper things to amplify were the culture 
differences, the friendships, the music, and the way we can all come 
together and have one of the best nights of the year sharing the moment.  
CDG I was a success in the fact that it brought together alot of listees 
that had previously not met one another.  CDG II was thrown because 
everyone enjoyed 1 so much and others kicked themselves in the ass for 
missing it.  CDG II ended up being a who's who of pb-cle. CDG III will be 
sadly moving locations from the 'Party Barn' where it was previously held 
the first 2 years.

What will be at CDG III:
Music.
Vibe.
Food.
Alcohol.
Boobie Touching (It's happened 2 years now, I can only imagine Paul 
Fleetwood will come with the mobile mammogram station)

DJ's:
Lemma (2 year performer at CDG I and II) - DNB - Columbus
Adam Ratana (1 year performer at II) - DNB - Pittsburgh
Soniq Stylz (1 year performer at I, 1 year non performer with poor woman 
management skills) - Breaks/Cheese - Dayton
Tom Cox (1 year performer at II) - Pittsburgh - tag set with yours truly 
which means something with soul and breaks.
Boompsie (1 year performer at II) - Cleveland - Techno (it's really hard 
to explain, but awesome to listen to)
Moose (1 year performer at II) - crAkron - Breaks
Osmotic (1 year performer at II) - Pittsburgh - House (he's running mango 
that night, so he's a tossup)
Jwan Allen (CDG virgin) - Pittsburgh - bringing something nasty.
Nick S (CDG Virgin) - DNB, trying to get him possibly to tag with Jea 
Leigh 

there are others that I am awaiting confirmation from, but this may end up 
being alot of tag, but more than likely things will happen as usual and 
we'll be waiting for a couple people to show up and people miss their 
slots, etc... so also if you want to spin, drop me a line....

Oh yeah, the shit is FREE.  The performers get nothing but respect from 
those in attendance for volunteering their time, also much thanks to those 
volunteering to help out this year.

Sat Jul 19                       JEDI NIGHT                          Toledo

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Jedi Night
July 19th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring Djs:

Josh the Funky 1 - Chicago, IL - House - Funktion Recordings , IHR, Kid
Dynamite Recordings

Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, and
breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks.

In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In
the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at the
Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.

Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh
has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , "Bangin the
Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

As if his DJ'ing accomplishments weren't enough, Josh has also had his
hand in the studio producing tracks for the infamous Chicago labels I.H.R,
Kid Dynamite, and Strictly Hype Recordings. His tracks have been featured
on mix compilations and DJ play-lists throughout the world, further
establishing his reputation as a DJ/Producer. Josh has also lent a hand in
remixing for Chicago's number one house diva, Dajae. Her first single on
Kid Dynamite records entitled "Time" is an uplifting vocal anthem that has
received Billboard attention and has since been licensed to Credence
records in U.K. Most Recently Josh has re-mixed Dajae's newest single
"Everyday", also on Kid Dynamite records and already licensed to Defected
Records U.K.

Not one to be content with only producing records for other labels. In
2001 "The Funky 1" launched his own record label, Funktion Recordings. The
first release "Everybody Everywhere" by BSJ and Fun-K has found its way
into the record boxes of DJ's worldwide.

2003 shows no signs of slowing down as producers such as Santos Scanty,
and Jelo continue to churn out dancefloor stormers for his label. When not
in the studio or running the label, Josh is constantly touring the world
bringing his sound and skills together for the masses.

E-Sassin - Los Angeles, CA - DnB - Sound Sphere Recordings, Phunkatek
Recordings, Just Two

Eric Hull, a.k.a. E-Sassin, is a long time supporter and veteran of the
Los Angeles drum & bass scene. E-Sassin began his musical journey in the
late '70's as a drummer in progressive rock and jazz/fusion bands which
helped in developing his strong sense of rhythm. After a short stint in
the heavy metal scene, E-Sassin was introduced to the electronic dance
scene in 1989 through the techno/rave culture. "Once I started getting
into producing dance music, I finally felt I was on the right track to
where I wanted to be musically. My reputation as a cutting edge producer,
and later as a DJ, steadily grew, and so did the work.

In 1992 E-Sassin produced and self-released a techno album which got the
attention of Sunshine Records. They approached E-Sassin to work with the
groups L.A. Rave and The Movement. At this time The Movement's single,
"Jump Everybody Jump" was charting on Billboard's Hot 100 so for a year
and a half E-Sassin was touring with The Movement all over the world.
"During that time I was exposed to many different music scenes and
cultures. That's when I was first exposed to jungle. Jungle at that time
had just broken away from the breakbeat hardcore scene and what really
hooked me on the music was the way it combined the different styles of
music together with a more forward thinking use of technology. The intense
drum programming and the tweeking of sounds pushed the boundaries of the
available technology, which to me made it possible for new technology and
programming techniques to be created just to keep up with the demand.
That's progressive music by any definition" By 1996, E-Sassin had made the
transition into producing only drum and bass. "Even in '96 drum and bass
wasn't too widely accepted in the States and very few domestic labels were
releasing any of it, so I decided to start up my own label".

Sound Sphere Recordings came to light and the first two releases received
so much positive feedback, it quickly established a high level of
credibility for the label and for E-Sassin's productions. Subsequent
releases have continued to elevate Sound Sphere Recordings, which has
gained the label well earned respect from both American and European
artists. Sound Sphere Recordings is one of the pioneering West Coast
labels to be dedicated exclusively to drum and bass and continues to be a
leader in superior quality domestic pressings and high profile releases.
Currently, E-Sassin is producing and re-mixing tracks to be released on
Sound Sphere Recordings and other prospective labels. Recent works include
re-mixes of Tha Truth's, "Red Lights", which is featured on the mixed CD
"Urban Jungle", for Priority Records, UFO!'s, "Enemy Infiltration" from
Thermal Recordings forthcoming on Sound Sphere, and 60 Channels' "Give Me
Your Love" for World Domination Recordings. He is also a featured artist
on the much respected album, "The World of Drum & Bass" on Formation
Records, which showcases some of the best talent from around the world.

runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. In 2000 Josh took 1st place 
in the beat-mixing competition at the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off. 
Aside from competing, Joshs passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, which 
showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. Josh

4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)
Time: 12pm-2:00am
Date: 10-18-03
Location: Pittsburgh Expomart, Pittsburgh PA


Its time to show respect to a city that has been waiting for the 
opportunity to showcase one of todays hottest import car shows around.  
Our local based company is proof to an astonishing revelation that 
Pittsburgh, PA, a.k.a The Steel City, has what it takes to bring the 
import car scene to whole different level.  On September 28th 2002, Steel 
City Racing was the first company to bring Pittsburgh, PA and the entire 
east coast import car scene a unique one of kind event that displayed live 
street racing on an airport runway, an automobile show, sound competition, 
beautiful women, great prizes, and the top names in electronic music. 
Thousands of people traveled across the east coast to join together in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to witness this revolutionary import car event 
called Street Outlawz.   The company that made this event possible is back 
again and focusing their 100% undivided attention into bringing more 
quality events to the east coast import car scene.  We gave much thought 
about how we could improve our event from last year and we decided to 
eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes brutal outdoors so we moved 
the legacy that started it all indoors into a beautiful large facility. We 
wanted to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of 
kind superstar import car event. This year for 2003 Steel City Racing will 
be bringing you back to Pittsburgh, PA for the sequel to Street Outlawz 
the event that offers you more action than your normal import car show!

THE ENTERTAINMENT DOME:

ANABOLIC FROLIC-(Happy Hardcore)
(Toronto, Canada-Moonshine, Hullabaloo-DAMNDJS.com)

It has been a long awaited five years since North Americas godfather of 
happy hardcore has last performed in the USA.  The musical genius that 
brought you all seven compilations of the Happy 2B Hardcore hit releases 
from moonshine music is coming back to us for an out of this world 
experience.  If you are one that is unfamiliar with this respected name 
among electronic music leaders, allow me to attempt a description of a 
man/myth/ and now legend.  Anabolic Frolic is well known to the entire 
world for being one of the first happy hardcore djs to pioneer his style 
of music in this region.  He was signed to moonshine music early on in his 
career and began production of North Americas best selling electronic 
music series, Happy 2B Hardcore with over 400,000 copies sold world wide. 
Anabolic Frolic was not finished yet.  Being based in Toronto, Canada he 
found himself being unhappy with the countrys electronic music scene, so 
he decided to make a change.  He wanted to prove a point to the world and 
his government officials and spread the warmth of music.  The only way 
that this would be accomplished is he would have to form his own 
production company, Hullabaloo, and begin an era of great events!  For the 
past six years, the Hullabaloo events have attracted over 100,000 
attendees! It has become a legendary event and carved a name for itself in 
the hearts of all HHC lovers nationwide.  Now it is time for our love of 
music and fame to give the man that started it all his well-deserved 
credit and welcome the legendary Anabolic Frolic to Pittsburgh, PA! 


Freaky Flow w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
this mans outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its 
not magazines then its live TV.  The Freaky Flow combination has truly 
been just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals, then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

DJ X-Dream-(Trance)
(Caffeine/Topaz/Amped) (www.djxdream.com)

Once again we bring back another quality legendary performer with over 
20yrs of DJing under his belt.  It is has been a long over due time since 
this incredible high-energy performer has last been seen in the steel 
city.  With the vast growing majority of jungle fever that has swept the 
steel city these past few years, we decided that we needed to continue our 
love of diversity and music and bring this nationally acclaimed artist 
back to give you a sweet taste of heart pumping, soul jerking trance. 

KOS 2x4 XAVIER-(HardHouse)
(The Digital Assassin-www.DJKOS.com, Just Say Agency, Parksburg WV) 
(www.DJXAVIER.com , Cleveland OH)C

It is a pleasure for us to welcome back these two very talented 
individuals whom use to be a familiar duo in the steel city one time not 
long ago.  If you had the opportunity to see these two amazing individuals 
in tag team mode then you know what the crowd is in store for when we 
bring them to SO2.  For those of you who are not familiar with these two 
turntable terrorists then prepare yourselves for an action packed show 
that you will not want to miss!  These guys do it all. When I say all I 
mean all! There is no telling what to expect from these two such as: 
lighting their records on fire, wearing Halloween masks, and performing 
the most incredible dare devil turntable stunts you have ever witnessed 
before! Since they put aside their old style of hard house and started 
spinning breaks, SO2 will mark a very special occasion. On October 18th 
2003 this duo will be unleashing their old school flavor one last time.

you can beat raw mhz.   For all those mhz to be used, the instruction 
pipeline needs to be filled.   Intel did a LOT of hacking to try to keep the P4 
pipeline filled...
1) the have a huge inline level 1 cache on the processor (mainly to speed up 
tight loops)
2) they have massive logic to do out of order processing.   This means that 
as long as the instructions are not dependent on each other then they can 
execute out of order.   if the next (or first in line) integer unit instruction 
depends on the prior instruction (being executed) but the one following does not, 
then it will run the second instruction while the prior instruction completes 
and _then_ runs the first instruction in the pipe after the prior has 
returned a result.   This is the downfall of the P4 because each instruction takes 
LONGER than ONE cycle on the hertz and the dependencies really kill the x86 
instruction architecture.
3) all modern processors can run each sub unit independently.   The memory 
load/store, integer unit, floating point unit MMX, etc.   each one can do a 
single instruction.


32 vs 64 bit has nothing to do with it.   the fact that the G5 has 4 times as 
many registers on the CPU than the intel has a lot to do with the G5 being 
faster.   The PowerPC was initially designed in the modern world after all the 
mistakes of the x86 architecture.   academia really had a chance to optimize 
what processor design and instruction architecture can do.   the P4 is still 
stuck with the same basic instruction setarchitecture (ISA) that intel designed 
back in the 70s on processors that ran at 3-5mhz.   These 3ghz machines would 
be much faster if Microsoft allowed intel to revamp the whole ISA.

The G5 has more sub-units allowing it to process more instructions per cycle, 
it also can execute each instruction in less cycles than the P4.   what does 
this mean?   it might run at 2 ghz but it's a blazing fast chip.   The chip 
can do more with less.   Apple skewed the results, yes. but the chip is supa 
fly.   the 64 bit-ness of the chip only means faster RAM memory accessing with 
more memory (at least for the common user).   But this amounts to real benefit 
when working with programs like photoshop, reason, logic, bitheadz, etc.   
because they primarily deal with moving bits, bytes, and nibbles around the 
machine.

In other words, you can beat raw mhz.   Before making a statement like "can't 
beat raw mhz", may I suggest spending $27,000 on some freshman Electrical and 
Computer Engineering classes at Carnegie Mellon.

skewed results, whatever.   I'm still getting one because it's beautiful.   
LOL, primarily it can generate and process 50-80 channels of audio at a time 
and my current machine can only do 8-10 which is not enough for the production I 
do.   can't wait for august.

lets get one thing straight here, i am not a wintel evangelist.  intel
has fucked themselves dozens of times on their architecture.

of course the G5 is a better architecture, my point was that apple
blatently skewed the results, something pretty much every manufacturer
is guilty of.  i'll still take an ultrasparc 3 any day.

1. stop using aol.
2. learn how to use wordwrap.

high clock speed and high throughput both have their applications.=20
experience teaches you when to use the sun server and when to use the
intel server.

    can i tell you what an arrogant prick you

    you sound like a stereotypical rich bitch

dude I love AOL.   They rape and pillage.   you can't miss a piece of that 
action.   should buy some stock in it.   they already own nearly every magazine 
and movie that you love. lol.   wait wait for AOL radio stations.   they have 
their eyes on clearchannel, just you watch.

ahhh, the list drama, how I have missed it so.

You want amazing technology?   Take a look at the chip architecture of the 
Radeon 9800 Pro.   it's sick.   their pixel shader technology is top notch and 
their APIs are amazing!

please don't take this stock tip.  AOL is in bad shape.

As for the mac/pc debate.  I own both.  I think they are both good for
different reasons and its stupid to say one is better then the other.  A
computer is a tool.  Sometimes you need a different tool thats all.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} PowerMac G5 is out. (why the P4 is slow)

Fuck all y'all... trust me on this one:

It becomes a moot point on the whole processer argument for one basic
problem, and that is NOT the # of registers.  Compilers often fuck up,
very directly, and programs are often written RAD in other programs
(i.e. VB, the aforementioned Nato set) that are not anywhere near as
efficient as they could be.  P3's are much more efficient that p4's and,
as far as how the average computer on Mac will run an average compiled
program, Macs are better... why, RISC architecture.  Practical reasons
for RISC is this: we have less commands so the processor spends less
time looking through the commands for the right one.  This applies
firstly in its obvious level, and then on the fact that, ergo, a
compiler cannot screw up RISC processing more than it can CISC
processing.

Even at the end point however, apps are bragging silly things and using
stupid benchmarks.  Both P4s and G4s and you all go ga-ga about a
computer being able to crunch 10 tracks in realtime or close.  FUCK
THAT.  Over 2 years of work with a good friend, I built something that
can crunch about 30 Video streams simultaneously on a p3 WITHOUT
dropping frames and in realtime (oh yeah, and doing f/x).  (and,
computationally, video is MUCH worse than audio).

Bottom line: most programs for both machines are written worse.  Mac's
have better hardware, but the actual code and app selection on Macs
SUCKS.

Furthermore, Microsoft owns about 25% of Apple. Wake up and realize that
if Bill Gates actually gives a shit about which you buy, he's probably
going to prefer you'll buy an Apple because he'll make more $$$ off of
you.

lets get one thing straight here, i am not a wintel evangelist.  intel

of course the G5 is a better architecture, my point was that apple
blatently skewed the results, something pretty much every manufacturer
is guilty of.  i'll still take an ultrasparc 3 any day.

1. stop using aol.
2. learn how to use wordwrap.

high clock speed and high throughput both have their applications. 
experience teaches you when to use the sun server and when to use the
intel server.

apple could replace the cpu with a baked potato and mac users would
still buy it.

Ah the voice of reason.   To each their own.   I have both as well (with an 
order in for the G5).

whomever takes stock advice from pB-cLE has shit for brains.   Anyone who 
give stock advice on pB-cLE is a serious comedian or has monkeys flying out their 
butt.   Which reminds me, Bruce Almighty is a VERY funny movie.   The scene 
where a monkey comes out a guys ass is hilarious!   I'd like to be god for a 
week or two.   learn something new.

don't worry, it's still a few weeks away.

this lineup is incredible.  great elements from underground hip hop, indie,
and electronic music.  this is the third year of this and it keeps getting
better and better.  i hope columbus will show its support and keep events
like this happening in our area.  where else will you ever see doormouse,
dego, jean grae, dead meadow etc. all in one show?

  i think i get to play before the locust.  i can't WAIT for that :D

>From your Arts Technica article:

"If you really wanted compact, optimized code, your only choice was to
code in assembler. (In fact, some would argue that this is still the
case today.)"

Seeing as at least one of the main points of my post concerned how the
programs themselves screw up... the point still holds.  As to how to
make things like a 30-video stream playback and manip app work, try
writing 10,000 lines of in-cache MMX assembly.  The pretty much solves
your problem right there.

P.S. Of COURSE I'm fucking talking to lawyers.

*cough* bullshit *cough*

You're spewing five year old marketing hype.  Don't believe the hype.
Here's a nice little article for you:
http://www.arstechnica.com/cpu/4q99/risc-cisc/rvc-1.html

And I'm sorry, but where is this miracle application that crunches 30
video streams in real-time?!  Being a VJ, I mess around with alot of
video software, and it's hard to get more than three or four video
streams layered with effects on them all at once on _any_ platform.
At that point it isn't so much about the processor as it is your
memory, pci, and hard-drive bandwidth, along with GPU optimization.
Shouldn't this miracle app, or something on par, be out on the market
instead of sequestered on your friends hard-drive?  You better contact
an IP lawyer and get that patented if its half as good as you brag it
to be, you're in the money baby!  *cough*

For some reason the PB-CLE didn't ever send my first of 3 messages:

If you guys thing Cycling74 is cool, check out either:

Isandora (Mac)
NATO
Max/NSP
Jitter
And Motion (PC)

Motion is actually my product, which is designed to be a completely
remappable video system, so you can build anything from a video wall
controller to a VJ app to a non-linear editor to a MIDI responsive audio
sampler to an audio playback app in it.  Right now motion is --1-- in
presale --2-- primarily a video-based app, but the turnaround time on
making a multimedia app within motion is innumerably faster than in any
of the above.

To check a feature list on the growing/developing website:

http://motion.synesthetic.com/about.php

Working on a Mac version as well, as soon as I convince my investor to
shell out the cash on a G4/G5 ;-)

Subject: {pb-cle} Sun. June 29th : Free wnysor.net picnic : Chestnut Ridge Park

Sunday, June 29th, 2003 
2003's First Picnic 
Noon til Dark 
Chestnut Ridge Park 
Orchard Park, NY 
Shelter #37 

FINALLY we have a date and shelter reserved for the
first wnysor.net picnic of the year!! We have reserved
a different spot than last summer, this is dubbed the
"million dollar shelter" because of the large field,
large shelter, and bathrooms very close by. Special
thanks to Phil who works at the park for reserving the
spot for us all!! 

What is it? 
A fun day in the park.. a grill will be provided,
turntables/sound will also be provided. We encourage
everyone to bring there friends, families, and pets
(keep them on a leash at all times, and make sure they
are people friendly!).. This is not just for people on
wnysor, we organize it, but it's meant for everyone to
enjoy a day out. 

What should you bring? 
Your own food. 
Like it says above, there will be a grill available..
If anyone is a vegetarian remember that majority of
people are going to be cooking meat, if that bothers
you ya might want to bring your own little grill. 

Your own beverages. 
No glass containers allowed! Even with cans, we
encourage anyone drinking alcohol to drink out of a
cup and keep empties in the garbage. There are
sheriff's in the park, underage drinking is punishable
by law! 

Also.... 
Bring a dish or something to share with everyone! 
Last year there was a few picnic tables full of food
that people brought to share with others.. either some
sort of salad, chips, dip, jelo, whatever.. 

We'll be at Shelter #37 "The Million Dollar" Shelter,
there will be signs at the park to direct you to where
everyone will be!!

Directions to Chestnut Ridge Park... 

Get to the 90 West towards Erie PA 
Get off at exit 55 - Route 219 - toward ORCHARD PARK/
SPRINGVILLE 
Exit at ARMOR-DUELLS RD toward RT-240/ CHESTNUT RIDGE
PARK/ RT-277 
Take the ramp toward RT-277/ CHESTNUT RIDGE/ RT-240/
ORCHARD PARK 
Turn RIGHT onto NY-277/ CHESTNUT RIDGE RD 
Follow Chestnut Ridge Rd a little ways down 

DO NOT TURN RIGHT ONTO NEWTON RD, there is a sign for
the park 
but do not turn onto it - keep going straight 

Just past the road, there is a small road on the right
that 
goes up a little hill which brings you into the park. 

At the top of the entrance you will go right 

Look for "WNYSOR" signs, we'll be at Shelter #37 The
Million Dollar Shelter

Subject: {pb-cle} Jerry Bonham Review

Here's my quick summary and review -- everybody, please feel free to fill in
the blanks, and to those who have read this review elsewhere...My apologies
for not being original and writing a completely different one.

For as much as his set started out dabbling -- a little house here, a
classic trance track there -- the last parts were phenomenal. In the
beginning, I think he really wanted to test the crowd and see what we were
up for. That wonderful shxt-eating grin he had on his face when he brought
the meaty stuff in the last half said it all.

The most "mainstream" "lite" track he played was that Coldplay remix, and I
think he definitely noticed the significantly fewer amount of people that
were dancing & vibing to it. So, he found out what we were about and found
his own groove, and brought it back in nice and dark and into greater
complexity, and dizzam! There was no turning back. Track after track after
track, mixed seamlessly and chosen so well, the transitions between tracks
were unnoticeable. I said to myself, "THIS is Jerry Bonham. It's THIS where
his reputation has been earned."

I don't think Jerry stopped grinning once -- nor did half the people I saw,
most of whom came up to me or Dave and said, "This guy is incredible." Some
people didn't have to say it...you could see it in their sweat-drenched
clothes and moving feet.

Jerry finished the set with "Flaming June." I just stood there wanting to
cry. It was a beautiful and perfect ending.

Deviant's set was incredible, also. He picked up where Bonham left off,
keeping the mind trip and
"I-can't-stop-dancing-even-though-my-legs-are-about-to-fall-off" vibe going.

Someone who had seen Jerry a few years back in Pittsburgh said that he was
so much more into this set and the vibe than he was when she saw him before;
She said that there was definitely a hella lotta vibe here and that he
looked soooo much more happy with it.

Thanks everybody...see you in a couple weeks for Randall Jones on July 12.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Jerry Bonham Review

I stayed for a little over the first hour and was totally amazed.  The
coldplay thing didn't do much for me either, but it was a nice remix that
others were into - personally I would have prefered the new Phonetic record
in it's place.... seal?'s vocals over top of a song that sorta rips Moby. I
was really digging the BT track, it was the first time I heard it out and
now it is a favorite.   I really enjoyed his range of diversity in the first
part of his set, that is one of the things that I respect out of a dj.  I
really enjoyed that harder prog stuff he was playing that was giving me a
feel of alt.rock without being a typical hi-energy hard sound.  I get board
listening to one sound and I really enjoy a dj who can go from one sound  to
another and still play a sensible set.  Jerry Bonham was DEFINATELY a good
experience.  Thank-you Headrush for bringing djs of this quality to a space
where you can truely appreciate the music.

> For as much as his set started out dabbling -- a little house here, a

> the meaty stuff in the last half said it all.

> The most "mainstream" "lite" track he played was that Coldplay remix, and
I
> think he definitely noticed the significantly fewer amount of people that
> were dancing & vibing to it. So, he found out what we were about and found
> his own groove, and brought it back in nice and dark and into greater
> complexity, and dizzam! There was no turning back. Track after track after
> track, mixed seamlessly and chosen so well, the transitions between tracks

going.

Good time, great music.  The whole jungle theme was sweet and place was well 
decorated.  Awesome to see so many familiar heads out.  If you havent 
checked this out yet you should.

So given this fact,   this months end super set is not techno but insane=20

there are messed up crazy samples everywhere.   There is one part where he t=

in a sample of a door bell.   the music starts playing again, and after 20=20
seconds the music stops and someone answers the door "Hello"...   and bang t=

music starts again.   Throughout the set he plugs samples from old game show=

This is either a repeat, I have esp, or someone is tapping the archives and
resending things cuz this conversation about emo..well it has happened
before..i think..in anycase i think being so confused should be grounds for
being somewhat emo..whatever the hell that means..
Out of the loop on this track at least,

This is either a repeat, I have esp, or someone is tapping the archives

I never said I liked or disliked any of those bands. That's just what
they are classified as. "Alternative" Rock was never the 'alternative,'
it was the mainstream, but was a way to help people find the music in a
record store.
Sum 41 and New Found Glory are considered "punk." Case in point.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} question

I beg to differ here.

Before alternative became a word, you were referred to as progressive.  To
me progressive music was pretty much all inclusive of industrial, depeche
mode new order stuffs, and all the 80's stuff was part of it.

Then industrial became goth, the dance stuff became rave, and the rock stuff
became alternative.  Nirvana crossed the lines of "acceptable" with all the
genre's and progressive became a dead term.

Or the shorter simpler version:  Alternative Rock was an "alternative" to
all the metal hair bands and classic cock rock bands.  Hence Metallica
cutting their hair to somehow fit the image of "alternative".

I had read a couple years ago that Emo was the new word for alternative
rock, but I thought it went in and out.  Maybe the adaptation of it by these
punk bands brought it back to life?

The best description of progressive/alternative I ever heard was "music that
matters".   Lyrically and otherwise.  I think that got watered down in the
mid 90's and alternative became the marketing ploy you described.

That's what my opinion is anyhow.

thats just a load of crap really. i can remember the "emo" tag
back in 1996 being widely used to describe whiny punk crap. its
gotten even worse. now its an excuse to play fast bar chords while
whining about how horrible your suburban life is and putting gel
in your hair to try to get girls. emo is just wack music for
people who cant actually handle any of the good things punk rock
stood for.

yeah i agree with that.

I remember hearing Jerry Bonham June 2001 @ Groove... He was really really good and I had never heard of him... Still on of tha best $10 I ever spent.   Corola was probly better tho that summer.  But Bonham was good.  Very good.  SF is where its at.
 
peace.

Here's my quick summary and review -- everybody, please feel free to fill in
the blanks, and to those who have read this review elsewhere...My apologies
for not being original and writing a completely different one.

For as much as his set started out dabbling -- a little house here, a
classic trance track there -- the last parts were phenomenal. In the
beginning, I think he really wanted to test the crowd and see what we were
up for. That wonderful shxt-eating grin he had on his face when he brought
the meaty stuff in the last half said it all.

The most "mainstream" "lite" track he played was that Coldplay remix, and I
think he definitely noticed the significantly fewer amount of people that
were dancing & vibing to it. So, he found out what we were about and found
his own groove, and brought it back in nice and dark and into greater
complexity, and dizzam! There was no turning back. Track after track after
track, mixed seamlessly and chosen so well, the transitions between tracks
were unnoticeable. I said to myself, "THIS is Jerry Bonham. It's THIS where
his reputation has been earned."

I don't think Jerry stopped grinning once -- nor did half the people I saw,
most of whom came up to me or Dave and said, "This guy is incredible." Some
people didn't have to say it...you could see it in their sweat-drenched
clothes and moving feet.

Jerry finished the set with "Flaming June." I just stood there wanting to
cry. It was a beautiful and perfect ending.

Deviant's set was incredible, also. He picked up where Bonham left off,
keeping the mind trip and
"I-can't-stop-dancing-even-though-my-legs-are-about-to-fall-off" vibe going.

Someone who had seen Jerry a few years back in Pittsburgh said that he was
so much more into this set and the vibe than he was when she saw him before;
She said that there was definitely a hella lotta vibe here and that he
looked soooo much more happy with it.

Thanks everybody...see you in a couple weeks for Randall Jones on July 12.
