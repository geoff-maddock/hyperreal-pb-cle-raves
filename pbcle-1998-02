Hi everyone,
        Someone on this board mentioned that they knew of a place up in New
York that sold new 1200's for about $399 a piece.   If whoever that was could
post again what the name of that store was.  I'd appreciate it:-)

         Thanks
          Jason

PS.......for all those who were out at the "Blue Eyed Soul" show last night.
Wasn't it GREAT~!!!!!!!!!!

you should be careful...alot of deals you hear of on technics are false...they
often will give you tables that were set for european currents that are not
adaptable to american electrical currents....

also in cities like new york you have to watch heavily for bootlegs

sup spike + {pc-cle} massive?

biz was great! the irish centre was packed and FULL of energy as in
the days of old. i just love it how the pittsburgh scene relies on so
heavily on the irish centre after all these years. i'm one of the only
people who considers that a good thing, but i love it!

anyways, i didn't talk to anyone directly except for geoff m., who
(being the reeeeeeely nice guy that he is) gave me a freezey-pop... 18
inches of frozen fun. that was one of the nicest thing that anyone has
done for me at a rave.. rather unexpected. 

as for the music, i didn't get to hear ruffian's set much because of
the pre-dancing bullshit requirement of raves :) it from what i heard
it sounded realy good. then onto hazey, who selections were right on
the money, but who's mixing was quite lacking. jump-up tearin apart
the dancefloor @ a respectable hour @ the irish centre - that's what i
like to see :) ! onto product 19, who thoroughly impressed me! i
honestly wasn't expecting him to be so good - song selection + mixing
was right on the money). next came hipp-e who's style was very
different then i expected, but was great on the dancefloor
nonetheless. he played a whole bunch of house anthems and people we're
loving 'em. my personal fave: "you make me function...". i had to
leave half hour into rob's set (4:00) but i wasn't to sad about it.
when he was on, it was just like a concert. everybody stodd around
with lighters up and going completely crazy, going from one dramatic
buildup to the next. i didn't find it all that interesting, and there
were so many people pushing up towards the front, it was hard to dance. 

as someone mentioned before, the shadyness was pretty much contained
to the shadows against the walls and deep corners of the back of the
irish centre (far away from the dancefloor - where it should be) which
helped the dancefloor's vibe a bunch.

a few more things:
1) big up all the paintball mask on the dancefloor massive ;)
2) if the beastie boys are really at getto booty battle... !
3) big up house of styles/john.

i heard this advertised on jamming 92.3 (i don't normally listen to that
but i was in a car with no cassette deck) last night, + it's being held at
club 1148. they don't even know what jungle is they said such + such a
DJ "will play jungle! AND drum + bass!" well duh, it's the same thing. is
this what was meant by raves moving to clubs like they have in europe? is
that what we have to look forward to, parties advertised on "hit dance
mix" radio stations + held in places like that? yuck. something else that
sucks about clubs is some have dress codes. most places that play hip-hop
do. the nicest shoes i own are work boots. i could never get in.

i was at this club last night (the interbelt in akron) because there was
nothing else to do + it's so hard to dance when you're being intently
watched by somebody who sees you as a sex object. this guy who gave me a
ride there doesn't leave me alone no matter what i say or if i walk
right away from him + he's old enough to be my dad. what a pervert. it's
also hard to dance when out of 50 people on the dance floor, only like 3
other people are even making an attempt to. =(

hmm, this isn't a very cheery post. at least the DJ there did a few tricks
(backspins + such) even though i couldn't see it + played disco's  
revenge (cool). he was somebody from mecca.

anyway, ed luna i have a tape for you finally. =] but i don't have your
address! give it to me + i will send the tape.

the perfect blend of buildup and delivery. ;)

first review from me in a long time ;)

anywayz ... biz was a blast, Rob De La's first set was my favorite of the
nite. I really enjoyed the way he was feeding off the crowd's energy.
Maybe the DJ shoulden't be the center of attention (like a concert), but
I enjoyed the scratchin and dancin'. The other Dj's were all pretty
good, thou' I was yearen for some breaks (you know the slow, funky
central flordia kind). 

Good size turnout, H20 was cheap (definatly a plus), and the vibe seemed
good. I spend most of the night up front in front of the fan (it was the
coolest place, plus the right mix of sound and lights. The vibe up there
was good, with every one dancein and what not ... ran into costa up
there ...

It was a refreshing change to see such a decent lineup at a reasonable price.

peace

...gotta love the ending of this one.  Enjoy...;)

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
WASHINGTON, DC--With first-quarter Club Rotation Index figures the 
lowest in seven years, and imports outselling domestic 12-inches more than
two-to-one, economic observers throughout the U.S. are sounding the
alarm over the nation's rapidly declining techno-industrial base. 

      "America faces a grave moment of crisis," said DJ Nathan Brackett, 
Secretary of Industrial and Hardcore, in a recent speech before Congress.
"Vinyl imports from both Europe and Japan are threatening our nation's
once-great techno-industrial power base. Our Gross National Beats Per 
Minute is at its lowest point since 1991. The message is clear: We must
fuck up the mix, or all is lost." 

      In its late-'80s/early-'90s heyday, America's techno-industrial 
complex seemed unstoppable. Led by such formidable powers as Nine Inch
Nails and Ministry, the U.S. achieved near-total dominance of the global
dance-mix marketplace. Even in the traditionally insular Eurodisco 
field, the loud, banging, clamorous sound of American-made techno strongly
influenced such foreign industrial powers as Front 242 and KMFDM. 

      Less than a decade later, however, the glory days of the American 
techno-industrial complex seem far away. With over 20,000 former clubgoing
elite out of work in the warehouse district of Chicago, and the Detroit house
scene over $7 billion in debt, bitterness over the nation's eroding 
techno-industrial base can be felt throughout its once-thriving industrial
centers. 

      And with the rise of such overseas dope on wax as drum 'n' bass, 
ambient and jungle, the problem, experts say, is not going to go away 
any time soon. 

      In fact, many fear that foreign competition from such 
heavy-hitting imports as England's Prodigy and Chemical Brothers, 
Germany's Atari Teenage Riot and Japan's DJ Krush--whose rare vinyl
imports fetch up to $29.99 domestically, even for a remix track--will
overtake America's floundering techno-industrial base by the year
2000. 

      Many, including NYC illbient's DJ Spooky, contend that fault lies 
in American industrial's inability to adapt to the changing realities of 
modern times. 

      "We must retool America's angry, metallic, hard-edged industrial 
mix to better reflect the mellowtronic, groovadelic peace memes of the 
emergent global cyber-age," he said. 

      California's DJ Shadow agreed. "We are being beaten at our own 
game. Trip-hop was invented here, but right now, the British are simply 
doing it better," he said. "America has got to seriously remix its
priorities." 

      In the face of the foreign dance-floor dominance, President 
Clinton is urging Congress to pump money into the revitalization of the 
nation's techno-industrial infrastructure. 

      "It is not enough to say, 'We must drop bass.' It is not enough to 
say, 'We must rock the crazy beats,'" President Clinton said Monday in a 
secret live appearance at D.C.'s famed underground The 930 Club. "If
American techno is to become the world's leader once again, we must drop
much bass; we must rock mad, phat-ass, crazy beats; and we must do so
quick-fast in a hurry, 24-7, 365. And I am out." 

      Many conservatives in Congress, however, oppose to such change. 
"U.S. techno-industrial is hardcore, and it must stay hardcore," said 
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT). "Would Al Jourgensen wear a T-shirt depicting
smiley aliens telepathing 'Love' to their baggy-pantsed children? Techno should be about hate, not 
love. Techno is about wearing black and screaming, not standing in one
place and swaying peacefully. I say, bring back the days of Skinny Puppy." 

      "Techno? Industrial? I am not familiar with these strange terms," 
said Rolling Stone magazine's Jann Wenner, speaking from one of his 
boats. "I do understand, however, that something called 'electronica' is
the Next Big Thing. It says so right on the cover of our latest issue."


Hee hee,

Yeah Yeah Yeah I have stiff opinions, shoot me.

The DJs KICKED ASS! I dont know who it was but somebody got the crowd to
stand still because they rocked so hard people just stared at him.  (At
this point I came in my pants, quite literally).  

The lights were fucking insane too.  Usually I get the feeling that the
light djs just programmed in some standard or maybe random movements and
then walkd away. But these were actually in sync with the music a few
times! I enjoyed just standing there watching the show for a change.

Yeah, it was crowded.  Last time I went to the Irish Center there were
about half if not less then that many people.  (And the bathroom was
destroyed, looks like it survived this time, or atleast it had by 5am
when I left). I think thats what kept me from dancing was that it was so
crowded.  I was ->| |<- far away from dancing like a madman but just
couldnt let myself go for some reason.

My only real complaint was the crowd.  I left because it started to feel
like I should be holding a beer in my hand or something.  How did it
turn into a club/fratparty scene so fast?!?  I'm not saying it was bad,
97% of the crowd was quite nice, but it just wasnt my style.  I dont go
to rave/parties to watch big beefy men sway with bootysellers on the
dancefloor constantly lookin around to see who is watching. Though I
thought it was quite cute watching the hardcore kids playing with
glowsticks, not as much pzaz or style as a good glower but I felt some
serios melding going on between the masses.  It was definitly a great
mixer for pittsburgh, lotsa people from all walks of music, but thats
not for me.  

So was this party like excessivly publicly advertised? Its stuff like
this that kept them in the underground so long ago.  I just prefer the
party where 80% of the attendees are fucked up on something or other and
dressed in typie rave outfits or costumes or plainclothes.  There were
people there that looked like they just got out of a prom and a few that
looked like they came from a gay or leather club.  (Hey I go to gay
clubs too, I just dont go to raves as gay clubs :) Me, im straight at
raves and bi/gay at clubs, but hey thats me.  

For 15$s it was definitly worth it even if only till 3 or 4 am.  Id give
the sound/lights a definitly 10 the crowd a 5 or 6 though.  Still quite
memberable though, still got my bracelet on and plan to keep it on till
it falls off. (These things fuckin last forever :)

I still vote for more parties at the irish center, if for no other
reason then I know I can walk there/back if I have to.

First of all, i suggest that you listen a little more carefully before you tell
a few hundred people what you think about the commercial.  The person on the
commercial did NOT say "jungle AND drum + bass" as you claim, but simply
"jungle drum + bass."  I know this because I was present at the taping of the
commercial and also co-wrote the script along with my partner, Aaron Pearl (who
also did the announcing for the commercial).  I can send you a copy of the
script along with a tape of the commercial to verify this.  

You need to consider the audience that this commercial was intended for; this
being a cheesy commercial hit dance station.  I shouldn't have to explain the
rest to you but i will anyway.  The reason we said both is because we wanted as
many people as possible to identify with what kind of music we were talking
about.  The average Joe who reads Rolling Stone, for instance, sees mentionings
of drum + bass but would look at you funny if you asked him about jungle.  I'm
sure you get the point by now.  

As for the raves moving into clubs argument, i'll pretty much just leave that
alone.  One will never erase the other.  

I've been unsubscribed to this list for nearly a year now due to the fact that
i don't have a computer anymore, but this post was brought to my attention and
i felt the duty to defend myself and my partner as well as the legitimacy of
our Sunday nights at Club 1148.  

Everyone needs to remember that they were once new to all of this.  We were
simply trying to reach people who may think we are actually doing something
exciting in this city for once and who may otherwise not have heard GOOD
electronic music before (and Greta, you've seen me play before so you know I
have somewhat good of taste i.e. not playing La Bouche).  Cleveland is a *huge*
city.  I just couldn't understand why every other major city in this counrty
has at least one great weekly club that brings in large dj's and has over a
thousand people every week.  New York has Twilo, Chocolate Factory, etc. 
Baltimore has Buzz.  San Francisco has Spundae among a slew of others.  Toronto
has Industry.  My point is that Cleveland needs something like that and it's
just been too long and i got sick of it and am now trying to do something about
it.  I think the hundreds of people who showed up on our first night seemed to
be of the same opinion.  I couldn't be happier with our first night, everyone
was smiling and the dance floor was packed the majority of the evening.  

I thank everyone who showed up and i'll see you all next Sunday...

Um yea, its been way too long since anyone did a weekly club with great out
of town dj's in Cleveland!?
Nobody in Cleveland has tried that before. And not lately either.
Especially on a Sunday. Or a Wensday. So yea, your right Cleveland really
needs a good weekly club.
Let me just say that I wish you luck, and I hope you don't invest too much
of your own loot, cause Cleveland has a way of getting dissatified with
things really quick.
Or better yet, someone else just may open another club on the same night
and split the already diminishing club crowd!

WCF is a definite possibility.  Maybe stickman will give you a hint.

Or maybe, just maybe it'll be at the Ewok Village -
 I hear they have a really boomin' system.

Obviously you have a short memory. Don't you remember the weekly event
that Dan Curtin did at the Brillo Pad called "Turned On" back in 96? His out
of town djs were none other than Terrance Dixon, Dan Bell, Claude Young, 
Russ Gabriel, and K Hand all within a 6-month timeframe. Plus Dan Curtin 
and Mike Filly weren't too bad either. So if you think "nobody in town has 
tried that before" then think again. I wish someone else would bring names
like that into small venues like that. The feeling of such quality music in
such an intimate setting was quite memorable for me and i haven't gotten
that feeling from any local event since. Hopefully Jeff can pull this night
off bring that feeling back to cleveland.

Isn't there this little weekly thing in the flats already? I believe the name of
the
place is 'Trilogy' or something like that...

tee, my fav quote (and the one on my aol profile) when i used to hang 
w/ jeff wuz "think about the future, you are the future"...never figured
he'd name his new sunday night out FUTURE...btw caught Jeff @
CENTRIPETAL here in da 614 and his jungle mixin skillz are def
worth checkin out...

man i thought i wuz gettin old & bitter, is it me or when did Cleveland 
get so anal?...funny ting is, i've hung out w/ y'all & none of y'all were this
anal before...hellz we've got a new sunday night out here in Columbus...
It's called FALLOUT, it wuz held at a friggin korean restaurant, but i
was just happy there was someplace to go w/ decent music & to hang out 
with your friends on a sunday night!...the only thing remotely decent dat
has happened on a sunday night here wuz when doug brought out trevor
lamont and phantom 45 to the Red Zone (which is about the equivalent to 
cleveland's Trilogy)...

despite the odd venue, the party wuz da bomb...Rec Shop kept the vibe up
all night long...i'd rather stare at some peeps that can rip up the floor
than trainspot all night any day....even still DJ Swamp kept the train
-spotters very happy near the end of the night...unfortunately there were
so many trainspotters i couldn't see if friggin Daffy Duck wuz spinnin
...but the Li'l Louie track he spun wuz def trademark DJ Swamp...not only
was there ear candy and eye candy, there was also tongue candy...they
actually had Korean Rolls there...nooo, not of the psychedelic variety,
but of the sushi variety!!...alls i can say is...nothin beats chillin w/ some 
good friends, eatin sushi, drinkin heinikins, rec shop tearin up da floor, 
and dj swamp wreckin da tables...

Subject: Tape Giveaway and a favor to ask

Hi All,
        As promised I want to show my appreciation for the support of the
everyone one this so.....
       I have finally gotten around to giving away those tapes. What tapes
you say? The Bulletproof "1.8.7 Fall Promo" tape. I have 10 left and all
you have to do to get one is to send a message to the address above with
the subject: TAPE

Rules:
 The first 10 people to follow the above instructions will get one but
please reply if you don't already have one. One tape per street address,
sorry.

Now for the favor. The new album entitled "Quality Rolls" is well on it's
way to completion and should be out in March/April.  Here is how one of you
can help me AND get you handiwork used in the CD insert of the album:
 There is a sign, visible from the 10th Street Bridge in Pittsburgh that
says Quality Rolls. At dusk or so they light up a big neon QR. If you can
tape some shots of this sign both lit at dusk and unlit in the day I'd very
much appreciate it and one of the photo's will be used in the CD. You will
also receive photo credit.  Photo's should be taken with a 35 MM camera,
sorry, no Polaroids. Anyone can do this however a person with a digital
camera would be most likely to get the job as we need these photos ASAP
(the cover is already done). If you think you can do this promptly then
please email me at the address above with the subject: PHOTO

Thanks in advance and good luck!

joe

Hmm....this reminds me of a good drinking game we used to play when we
went to Meka on Sunday nights (undeground night) a couple years ago.
Every time a DJ did a backspin, it was shot time.  Then we realized that
we were getting way too drunk by the time the night was over, so the game
had to come to and end.

Where is this?  I don't know if anyone has ever thought about this, but
there is this bullshit under 21 club in the parkway center mall called
club zoo.  they have "events" there every friday and saturday night
untill 12 (or at least they did when the old newspaper I just read was
printed), BUT if you offered them a whole bunch of money they might be
willing to make some arrangements . . . I don't know.  I just saw that
there was a big ass place where people dance  (they said most of the time
they get like 1700 kids there!) and there is probably already some sort
of sound system and thought it would be a good idea.

yeah, I know...a bit late but I've been busy/sick/lazy.

This was the best rave I have been to in pittsburgh and the first at the
irish center.  It was not the funnest rave (due to some bunk E), but I
still had a really good time.

Highlights:
the dj's - my gawd did product 19 and hazey kick ass, it was very
uplifting to hear some pgh residents kick the dancefloor into a churning
mass of ecstatic ravers).  I was less inspired by some of the out of town
talent but I thought they were all quite decent and I for the most part I
conmend HOS on their selection.

the place - First time in the Irish center for me.  I thought it was a
great place to hold an event (probably the best in pgh).  Lots of room
besides the dance floor that locked people in and was pleasantly crowded
at all times.  The huge fans on the dance floor were soooo nice!  Also it
was very cool to be able to walk back to cmu in a pinch.

the people - I really liked the crowd at this event.  Not only were all of
my pgh raver friends there but everyone I bumped into seemed into meeting
people and also seemed to be really enjoying themselves.  Too often I see
ravers that just stand around looking pissed off that they wasted $15 to
go to a rave.  I think a lot of non- or new- ravers came too which was
pretty cool as I fell into that category not so long ago.  

the lights - God damn!  This was the best light show I have seen at a rave
ever!  At times throughout the evening I caught myselft just losing
myself in the strobes and beams and forgetting to dance (bad joel!).

General Shadiness (there was very little of this):
Bum E - there was a lot of E for sale there which I thought was generally
a very good thing (I love to see smiling people with pupils the size of a
quarter!).  However, a LOT of this E was bunk which is a lot less fun.  Oh
well, ya take your chances.

The concert DJ - Forget his name but he just wasn't my thing.  If I want a
concert I'll go to a rock show (and I do occasionaly).  People seemed to
enjoy him though so I can't be too down on him.

Myself - I just felt out of sorts that evening and I really can't blame
that on anyone.

Props to House of Styles for putting on a kicking event.  I am a new
devotee and I hearby promise to go to any event they put on while I am in
pgh (and probably any event put on in the irish center too!).  Does anyone
know anything coming up in the next couple of weeks.  Term. Velocity
sounds cool but personally I think it is a crackpipe dream.

pEace,
jP

i bought the 2nd volume of happy 2 b hardcore (red one) by anabolic frolic
in tucson but kept forgetting to write anything about it. it is really
good, better than the 1st one. the best tracks are "you're mine" by dj
demo, "cloudy daze" by bang!, "kick your legs" by dna & breeze, and
"sweet in pocket 97" by justin time (although that one is on this other
(even better) tape i already had by d.cypol, it's good enough to listen to
twice anyway). the funniest parts of the CD are on "time" by vinylgroover
when it goes "if you look like a book then you will read me". haha when
does a person ever look like a book? and on "12" of love" (by sy &
eruption) there's this sample of some woman saying "twelve inches of
loovvee" in a low voice, then this guy goes "uhnn! uhnn!" hahaha ;)

That song is so stupid it makes me laugh out loud.  I thought I was
hearing it wrong the first few times.  I kind of like it to be so
absurd rather than just plain cheezy. :)

If anyone likes anabolic's stuff and can listen to REAL AUDIO, check out 
he free real-audio tape at:

Its def wicked with an ok MC.

i'm doing research for my painting class & i just came across this really
cool stuff about mondrian, in the book "mondrian" (by italo tomassoni).
this quote from the book describes some of his ideas:

"Music should abandon naturalism in favor of tones produced by machines
without individual participation, to be heard as pure sonorous form. Film
should have no narrative basis, and dance should be "abstract dance.""

pretty radicial thinking for the 1910s + 20s.

he was kind of a weirdo though. the book also says that his beliefs were
so rigid and dogmatic that when van doesburg (i haven't figured out yet
who that is) decided to use diagonal lines in his work instead of vertical
& horizontal, he (mondrian) stopped contributing to de stil magazine. i
read someplace else too that he hated the sight of nature so much that if
he was seated in a restaurant with a view outside, he would ask to be
moved.

	So, I've never been to "Club Zoo", but my brother went and he said he
freaked out the security guards with his dancing.  Now, not to get on the
good dancing/bad dancing kick again, but...well, he looks like an ape with
an itch in a weird spot when he dances, but I'm the only one who's allowed
to say that!!!  My point is: I think it's great fun to have a rave where a
lot of mainstreamers show up.  They file in from their mainstream, mundane
world into a world they consider to be dangerous an foreign and we get to
perform.  
	Being a performer, I enjoy this.  I like dancing and drawing a
crowd (um, because I'm interesting to watch...not bad, teehee, just
interesting).  They come and they try to apply their "club" moves to a new
music, which is also interesting in its own special way..ahem.  Anyways,
the scene is or should be constantly experiencing a rebirth.  New people
bring new ideas, for better or worse.  New people bring new experiences,
for better or worse.  New people are interesting, for better or worse!!!

Tee hee!!!  Please excuse me, I'm very giddy from my second opera
rehearsal.  It's kind of like Stomp meets opera.  I get to play with a BIG
stick in 7/8 rhythms 1+2+ 123 1+2+ 123  Wahoo!!!


Love ya

Sorry bout the last post I  dont want anyone thinking that I dont want
those kids there but my point is. Is that if there are alot of these
"preps" there chances are they dont want to be at this type of
gathering and there will be alot of bad vibes. Which will practically
ruin the whole thing.

No, I understand where you're coming from, but I look at it a different
way.  I try to think of everything as a joke.  Well, that sounds weird,
but what I mean is, in this day and age, everything we do (style,
expression, sayings, wordings, etc) has been parodied.  I always seem to
remember and the whole world becomes a joke.  Now this joke can be macabre
and dark, or childish and light.  I think if you laugh at it all, you can
rise above the clouds!

Love ya,
Jenifer

Hossam,

I was talking to Nick T. from BulletProof....isn't Jay (Alaska) also up to
bat at SteelCityJungle on February 10, 1998?  If so, I thought it should be

==============================================================
No, I understand where you're coming from, but I look at it a different
way.  I try to think of everything as a joke.  Well, that sounds weird,
but what I mean is, in this day and age, everything we do (style,
expression, sayings, wordings, etc) has been parodied.  I always seem to
remember and the whole world becomes a joke.  Now this joke can be macabre
and dark, or childish and light.  I think if you laugh at it all, you can
rise above the clouds!
===============================================================

on dat note, here's a li'l joke dat funkybizz forwarded to me (but wuz too
afraid to post due to all hard asses on pb-cle-raves) for all u net headz...

>> 
>> | An ambitious stockbroker finally decided to take a
>> | vacation.  He booked himself on a Caribbean cruise and
>> | proceeded to have the time of his life, at least for a
>> | while. A hurricane came unexpectedly. The ship went down
>> | and was lost instantly. The man found himself swept up on
>> | the shore of an island with no other people, no supplies,
>> | nothing.  Only bananas and coconuts. Used to four-star
>> | hotels, this guy had no idea what to do. So for the next
>> | four months he ate bananas, drank coconut juice, longed
>> for his old life, and fixed his gaze on the sea, hoping to
>> spot a rescue ship.
>> | 
>> | One day, as he was lying on the beach, he spotted movement
>> | out of the corner of his eye. It was a rowboat, and in it
>> | was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen. She rowed
>> up to him.  In disbelief, he asked her:  "Where did you come
>> | from? How did you get here?"
>> | 
>> | "I rowed from the other side of the island," she said. "I
>> | landed here when my cruise ship sank."
>> | 
>> | "Amazing," he said, "I didn't know anyone else had
>> | survived. How many of you are there? You were really
>> lucky to have a rowboat wash up with you"
>> | 
>> | "It's only me," she said, "and the rowboat didn't wash
>> | up;nothing did." He was confused, "Then how did you get
>> the rowboat?"
>> | 
>> | "Oh, simple," replied the woman. "I made it out of raw
>> | material that I found on the island. The oars were
>> whittled from gum-tree branches, I wove the bottom from palm
>> | branches, and the sides and stern came from a eucalyptus
>> | tree."
>> | 
>> | "But, but, that's impossible," stuttered the man. "You
>> had no tools or hardware-how did you manage?"
>> | 
>> | "Oh, that was no problem," the woman said. "On the south
>> | side of the island, there is a very unusual strata of
>> | exposed alluvial rock. I found that if I fired it to a certain 
>> | temperature in my kiln, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. 
>> | I used that for tools, and used the tools to make the hardware. 
>> | But enough of that. Where do you live?"
>> | 
>> | Sheepishly, the man confessed that he had been sleeping
>> | on the beach the whole time.
>> | 
>> | "Well, let's row over to my place, then," she said. After a
>> | few minutes of rowing, she docked the boat at a small
>> | wharf. As the man looked onto shore, he nearly fell out of 
>> | the boat. Before him was a stone walk leading to an exquisite 
>> | bungalow painted in blue and white.  While the woman tied up the
>> | rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, the man could
>> | only stare ahead, dumbstruck.  As they walked into the
>> | house, she said casually, "It's not much, but I call it
>> | home. Sit down, please;would you like to have a drink?" 
>> | 
>> | "No, no, thank you," he said, still dazed. "I can't take
>> | any more coconut juice."
>> | 
>> | "It's not coconut juice," the woman replied. "I have a
>> | still. How about a pina colada?"
>> | 
>> | Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepted,
>> | and they sat down on her couch to talk. After they had
>> | exchanged their stories, the woman announced, "I'm going to 
>> | slip into something more comfortable. Would you like to take a
>> | shower and shave? There is a razor upstairs in the cabinet in
>> | the bathroom."
>> | 
>> | No longer questioning anything, the man went into the
>> | bathroom.  There in the cabinet was a razor made from a
>> | bone handle. Two shells honed to a hollow-ground edge
>> | were fastened to its tip, inside a swivel mechanism. "This
>> | woman is amazing," he mused. "What next?" When he returned, 
>> | the woman greeted him wearing nothing but vines
>> | -strategically  positioned-and smelling faintly of gardenias.  
>> | She beckoned for him to sit down next to her.
>> | 
>> | "Tell me," she began suggestively, slithering closer to
>> | him, "We've been out here for a very long time. You've
>> | been lonely.  There's something I am sure you really feel like doing 
>> | right now, something you've been longing for all these months? 
>> | You know...." She stared into his eyes.
>> | 
>> | He couldn't believe what he was hearing: "You mean...,"
>> | he replied, "I can check my e-mail from here?"
>> |

to lance: yes lance, i do remember those days at the brillo pad. however, you
may also remember that TURNED ON was solely devoted to HOUSE music and did not
allow any other form of dance music to be played. thus, i chose not to include
it: that and the fact that it was such a low key night. i love events like
that, however, myself and my partner are attempting to present a night of a
much larger scale.

to steve: you know that i have no qualms with you or any other promoter/dj in
this city. FUTURE was being planned before we learned of your event, REAL.
regardless, it has been changed after your first month to a *FREE* (i'll even
mention it for you) club before ours even started. 

now, with all of that aside, let's get to the issues:

first off, i take it that you feel as though we are stealing your crowd. i
personally do not see our two clubs as being in very much competition with each
other. REAL offers a low-key club with no cover. the capacity of VISIONS cannot
be more than, what, 300-400? i am just guessing.. anyway, i have already stated
what we offer so i am not going to go over it again.

steve, you seem to be doing just fine on thursdays with MUSIC even though the
phantasy has brought in moderately large djs on a semi-regular basis on the
same night. both places are doing okay. this is what i believe will happen with
our two events. it is like peabody's and the agora theatre having two different
concerts on the same evening..

as for your sarcasm with us not being different from other clubs in cleveland
with what we are offering, let's take PLEASURE at u4ia for example. they have
yet to go an entire month with guest djs *EACH AND EVERY WEEK*. i was there
last week to promote and they did not have a guest. i believe it was $5 or $^
to get in. there were about 50 people there, if that. there is a theme here:
consistancy.

finally, comparing any club that has ever been here (except maybe METROPOLIS)
to a place like industry or buzz is proposterous. these are places that have
djs like richie hawtin, derrick may, and mickey finn on a weekly basis.
cleveland has *NEVER* seen djs of that calibre on even a semi-regular basis.
granted, we are not at the point yet, but that is the sort of calibre we have
in mind for the very near future (he). we started off as large as we
possibility could, but we plan to grow very rapidly.

like i said before, cleveland is a huge city. there is plenty of room for
everybody. a city this big should have choices of where to go on any given
night to have a good time. 

that is all i have to say on these matters because i do not want to have to
dictate my response over the phone like i did this time.

The reason that no Cleveland club does huge Dj's each week is that
Cleveland can't support it. You guys will see that when in 3 weeks your
numbers fall off drastically. And I mean no dis respect in saying that. You
can promote your hearts out have a different god dj each week, the fact is,
is that 90% of the people who cared about the music at all are gone. 50% of
the new generation of partiers don't have a clue (by that I mean in
general, not as in, a clue to any certain type of music ie. techno or
house) They have no loyality.
Carlos was a great choice for a first night, but I hope they keep comming.
At real, diesel boy drew 350 kids, but everyone else did less than 250.
Even Nigel richards only drew 250, and I mean Nigel isn't a mega star or
anything, but all the kids said, "Wow, look Nigels in Cleveland I'm
there!!"
Like everybody said it, but less than 1/2 actually came out.

I guess I was just mad because your post said that this idea wasn't tried
in Cleveland in a long time , when I just tried it 2 months ago. 5 straight
weeks of out of town tallent. 2 weeks of breakin even and 3 of loosin my
butt!
So good luck, but I just don't see Cleveland being able to support it.
I really hope and wish it does, but cleveland continues to rip my heart out
with it's sparadic attendence.

I'm not so sure it's just Cleveland, I went to Steel City Jungle like 3
weeks ago and it was jam-packed... went last week, and there was like
no-body there... like less than 1/4 of the people of 2 weeks earlier... I
dunno what gives? Mebby the lineup was that much better 3 weeks ago? prolly,
but I got to imagine that there's other people with nothing to do on tuesday
that like Techno/Rave etc...

like on a weekly event? Or at least the clubs that CLAIM to play Techno or

still do in a pinch)...

TIA

	Have you ever stopped to think how many ravers are college kids?
In Oakland alone there is CMU and Pitt, one of the largest schools in the
immediate area.  Downtown, we have Duquesne and Point Park College.
There's also Carlow and that other women's college that I always forget
the name of in Shadyside (or is it Squirrel Hill?).  I think that when
school lets out, be it christmas vacation, summer vacation, spring break,
turkey-day, a huge part of the club (laga) scene goes home.  While some
ravers do COME BACK from school, it's not nearly enough to fill the void.  
	This summer, at Laga, the Techno/House night failed and was
cancelled because it wasn't pulling enough business...BECAUSE EVERYONE
WENT HOME.  I realize that the clubs have to make a profit or crash and
burn, but they also have to take into consideration the ebb and flow of
attendance due to school attendance.  No school, no night.  Last year, the
T/H night seemed to be doing very well.  After a summer of doing poorly, I
can understand why they took it off the roster.  When school resumed,
however, the management should have taken that facter into consideration.
	I may be talking entirely out of my ass, so correct me if I'm
wrong.  It just seems as if Laga was perfectly balanced between
sub-culture and mainstream when they first opened.  They seem to be
ignoring the sub-culture with their band night every Friday and ONE
"techno" (i.e. jungle) night, every other week, which by the way, doesn't
happen to fall on my spring break!!
Boo hoo!

I do realize the scene can be fickle and orn'ry, but there are other
explanations for poor attendance, as well.

Remember, I'm talking out of my ass, so I could quite possibly be wrong,
if so, be kind :}

Just to add to this: did anyone besides me think that syntax (a smallish
rave held in a kareoke bar about 2 weeks ago) would make a good weekly.  I
thought this event was awesome and would transform perfectly into a weekly
night.  Attendance was high, vibe was right on and I think the bar made a
decent amount selling booze (admission was only $5).  It was kinda wierd
dancing in a kareoke bar with some kareoke people but everyone was just
having such a good time that it was very infectious.  Instagator had the
best set that I have heard from him (very, very nice!).  Any thoughts or
am I just once again outa my head on this one?

pEace,

personally, i think that anyone in pittsburgh who likes jungle is stupid 
if theyre not out every other week for steel city jungle.... its a great 
night, and cheap too..... its not even a problem with sleep/work/school 
schedule becuz its every other week.... ive missed only a handful of 
them over the last 6-7 months, and usually because i was sick or 
something....its good to go out and support it when they dont have the 
mega-dj's on the decks so that they can afford to bring in the quality 
out of town dj's.....and i really think that sine (scj's resident) is 
way underrated as a dj...... he has mad skillz, and i know most dont 
like his evil tech stuff, but it is one of the main directions jungle is 
heading in, so you cant say you like jungle and yet talk shit on a large 
portion of the music...... the point being, sine spins the new style of 
jungle, the so-called cutting edge, but all that brings people out in 
pittsburgh seems to be the jump-up, which has been around alot longer 
than tech, and we have a good dj who spins some good stuff that people 
overlook for some reason....its all shite....

Personally, I think Cleveland has some very high home-town caliber dj's that
shouldn't be taken for granted.  Sure it's nice to have "show" dj's like Ani
coming (Trilogy 2/15) and whomever else has been booked lately, but my
humble opinion is that the locals have been providing a higher quality show
and sound as of late.  It's not as if these out-of-towners are playing
anything radically different, they're just a hyped up name.

geoff, i subbed to the breaks list :)

david..i realised the reason i didn put on jay's name was b/c i only listed
the dj's for the nite kingsize was playing on that last flyer, i didnt
leave him out. (look below)


everyone else. please come and show your support if you want us to continue
to do this type of thing. we listened to you and brought in uk djs...don't
let what normally happens (ie-no support like in cleveland ;) happen to us
too.

we have uk djs lined up for april 21 and june 2. however that all hinges on
the success of next tues. 

and one more thing -- what do u think ppl's
reactions would be if we charged a few dollars more for a scj with overseas
djs would be? im talking like $6-$8 instead of $5...i think the
diehards/regualrs would pay it...it's those 'fence-sitters' that would
probably balk...and its hard to determine how many fence sitters we get on
a given nite.

i think youll get more of the high school crowd when you bring in 
someone from overseas....they may not be able to come regularly, but 
will make exceptions....i know of a bunch of high skoolers who will be 
there who normally arent there on skool nites......
if you did raise the price only a dollar, i dont think that would make 
much difference in the attendance........youll also get more people from 
west virginia and out in the cut who wouldnt normally make the trek to 
pgh on a tuesday, night, so a 2 dollar increase probably wouldnt matter 
because the non regulars will make up for the "fence sitters."

my opinion on bringing the uk djs is that first of all, you're only
bringing in tunes, b/c the great majority of the d&b djs ikn the uk
arent incredibly better djs skillwise than any good us dj.  they may
have some new tracks, but they get released in the us anyway.  grnated a
few exceptions for people like the rider, bryan g, fabio, and some
others that may have "exclusive" tracks but the majority of all the
tracks played get released.  So what I'm getting at is that it's pitiful
if someone says they are not going to go to a US jungle event unless
they get UK djs (and accepting the non UK DJs know how to DJ), because
theer just aint a big difference.  anyway, all the uk DJs play the same
tunes all the time.  so quit whinging.

MCs, however, are worth bringing over , but there are obvious reasons why.

had to say my piece.

Sine is absolutly underated as  a dj.
In my opinion Sine should be looked at just as any of the bigger american

His mixing skillz are supreme.the last time i heard him play was at a
cleveland event in the summer,he was playing jazzy smooth and
atmospheric....very nice set!

but in my opinion dark tech-step material is going to be one of the downfalls
of jungle just as it was in 93-94.Once again the cylcle continues...........

Time to get a few things off my chest.  I know this thread is getting old,
but sometimes the truth seems to get buried when people hype an event.

First, in regards to FUTURE.  Maybe I am already stating the obvious, but
what it boils down to is that the reason there is an event called FUTURE
is because 1148 wants to go head to head with Trilogy.  Please correct me,
but I highly doubt that the promoters are risking any sizeable investment
on this event if any.  None of this is wrong, but hey, lets not loose site
of what it really is.  The real problem I have with it all, is that I
often wonder why a club doesn't take the risk on a Friday or
Saturdayinstead they want to go after a piece of Trilogy's pie.  In all
honesty, I have to wonder how this will play out because atmosphere of the
venues.  Many of the "mainstream" people in Cleveland are scared of
Trilogy because it is a "place for freaks", yet in the mainstream 1148 is
known as a "place for guidos".  It will be very interesting to see how
this plays out.

I think it is funny that many people inside of Cleveland loose site of
what we DO have.  It is easy to associate a club with a city, and Church
(Trilogy/Metropolis) is often associated with Cleveland.  I often wonder
why, in the course of this thread, that U4ia is rarely mentioned.  As Mr.
Cinch mentioned, people in Cleveland have been very fickle in their
support of events.  Maybe it is because things aren't ALWAYS done exactly
right at club events.  I think the MOST ironic thing about this thread and
whatnot is the fact that "so and so a city has such and such a club and
they quite regularly bringing in names like such and such".  I saw Twilo
mentioned in this list, so this is what I will site as an example.  Twilo
hosts Junior Vasquez's Juniorverse every Saturday night.  If you pay
attention to the lists about Twilo, then you will know their drama in the
last few weeks has been about a door guy who will not allow women in the
club.  Now I need to point out, that their BIG nights, as are most BIG
nights inside NYC, are nights when the RESIDENT dj plays.  Clubs like
Tunnel and Twilo at times struggle at breaking even with bringing in big
underground "names" for their off night events.  My point to all this is
that we don't  look at what we have at home.  Saturdays at U4ia have
become very respectable in size and crowd type.  Trilogy still plays the
newest music in the city every Sunday nightfor the most part.

The reason I sited Trilogy and U4ia is because these two clubs have
resident dj's.  I often wonder why the local Cleveland DJ's do not get the
respect they deserve by people in our own town.  Many times they get more
love and respect OUT of town.  Ahh, but this is the way Cleveland has
always been and always will be.  But maybe it is not just Cleveland
mentality, maybe it goes deeper.  Many times I hear a DJ who plays parties
a lot play the same set every time.  He plays the same songs and the same
mixes every time he plays.  Sometimes I even wonder if they buy new music
more than once a month.  A DJ who has a club residency has to buy new
records weekly because the same DJ playing to the same people on a weekly
basis would get very boring if he didn't buy  new records every week.
Also, the fact is that a club dj has to play a set no LESS than 4 hours.
Many times 6+ hours.  In a set of that magnitude, a dj HAS to encompass
many different sounds and styles of music.  Add to this the fact that some
of our local residents get records in many cases months before they are
available in any kind of "dj store".  My point?  I wonder if the people in
Cleveland are that so stuck in the "know it before you like it" mindset
that someone who plays the newest stuff out there is just completely
dismissed.

I saw it mentioned that many of the club events don't include jungle,
therefore not playing a variety.  Well, here in Little New York, drum and
bass has certainly taken off.  It is definitely the music of choice for
the new to the scene raver.  It is my understand that a large chunk of
Future will be jungle.  I personally do not dislike d&b, nor is it my
favorite, so it will be very interesting to see what happens.

At least I got a small section of what I see wrong off my chest.
Newsgroups, like competition, can be SO healthy sometimes :-)

most of the jungle djs from the uk are the originators.....the very 
first people in the world to do the jungle thing......they are producers 
of the original classic songs.....im just gonna point out, ive only 
heard a few tapes of uk dj's live sets, but ive rarely if ever heard 
anything as good from a us dj....i would LOVE to see mickey finn, dj 
hype, ss, randall, kenny ken, even gr00\/rider......its just a different 
deal altogether.......tell me you wouldnt want to hear bukem 
live........i dont really like "inteligent jungle" that much, but he 
works majik, and to see him with his plates would be a real 
treat.....there are definitely us djs i wanna see too, such as dara and 
3d, but you gotta give props to the originators too...like shy fx and 
marvilious cain....do you think well ever see them here???? probably 
not....:(

Exactly.  We need something to do on Friday other than Brillo Pad.  And
Saturday?  Besides U4ia there's now Jupiter.  I went for the opening last
week and the space is great.  But where were the people?  I can't believe
that everyone cool in NE Ohio goes to raves each weekend.  And even if
they do, what about all the hundreds of thousands of other young people? 
Jeff is correct to point out that we have a *huge* city here, but it needs
some education.  Being exclusive only hurts the overall scene.  I'm all
for what he's doing with Club 1148.  That club has the best lighting in
Cleveland.  But having Sunday as the only big night out is completely
irrational.  It should be Friday and Saturday.  

But it takes time to build an audience.  Also, to be realistic, club
owners want older people who like to drink and have the money to spend on
alcohol.  Liquor fuels the music, in a sense.  So I doubt drum and bass
has a long term future here.  It's a college or high school kids kind of
music (Hossam don't yell at me).  What we need is a trance night.  Older
people can relate to that.  It's also accessible and danceable.  Music in
clubs is about sex and seduction, it's about losing yourself in the
rhythm. Break beat style might bring out the funky moves, but it doesn't
promote continuity.  Likewise, the Cleveland obsession with deep house is
ridiculous.  The dj's might love it, but it's fucking lounge music as far
as the dancing goes.  We need more Trilogy style house and trance in other
clubs.  That has a proven record for success and it should be replicated. 

Just some thoughts,

Braden

sorry to send out 2 message in a row, but i forgot something...

SCJ should try to get 1 or 2 uk headliners in and throw a regular old
RAVE. reasons:

* i'd definatly be able to go cuz it's on the weekend (same with other
high skoolers, who, as tome said, cant normally come during the week)
* you could charge as much as you needed to.
* you'd get the out of town crowd (and their money)

I totally agree with Frankie on this one.

While its cool to have UK selectaz at a club nite, I don't think pgh
can support it, especially on a tuesday night.  We have enough local
talent, and US talent to keep the thing going indefinitly and enjoyably.

What ever happened to jungle 'raves'?  UDG!  JUNGLE WARFARE!
They have a totally different vibe than SCJ.

i prob have more to say, but i'm a bit ill now...

l8s,

more than willing to shell out much loot to see the big guys from the
uk. if seeing brockie/mc det, mickey finn/fearless isn't worth paying
$10 for i dont know what is! not that i'm expecting to hear any of
these guys @ scj any time soon, but as long as i can get my parents to
say its cool for me to go i'll be there with x amount of money in hand.

I just wanna sidetrack a second and see if anyone likes stereolab. Not
really techno, but i think it's pretty rad.  I just bought Dots and Loops
and think it's the best thing i've heard in awhile.

haha you said fucking lounge music! now that's what we need at a party: a
FUCKING lounge. how orgiastic. ;) but seriously, on the same note, what
happened to chill rooms!?!? i MISS them! of course i don't spend the whole
party in them, but it's so nice to have a clean soft place to sit down +
rest your legs + your ears & watch the lasers/video projections/etc. once
in a while. of course you can't always have them, sometimes the space 
prevents it, but sometimes not. this ties into another post...

> i dont really like "inteligent jungle" that much,

i don't like when they play it in a main room, i.e. dance area, because
it's annoying when you just want to bust a big phat move + the music is
slow + mellow, but i like it in the chill room especially the more
techsteppy kind that fucks with your head.

whats up everyone? im gurldaze (producer and promoter) for KOVERT
COMMUNICATIONS out here in florida. if you all don't know about how dead the
scene is then let me tell you.....it's D-E-A-D!!! i tell ya!
anyhow...........kovert comm wants to slowly brings thing back to the scene
florida once had so long ago as it seems. new laws and new ppl are out here
and its changing everything. no more events for all ages and all you see is
breaks and some house...maybe a bit of jungle here and there...not much
though. i guess you can say we have  no real defined scene here. i subscribe
to 10 mailing lists in order to get help from other promoters, ravers, djs
and so on! i would appreciate your ideas of line ups, promo packs of
yourself or other dj or artists, or anything you can think of. i do
promotions for djs in the uks and us as well as a dj in canada..im really
hoping to broaden the horizons. what im doing is not making me any money..i
could SERIOUSLY care less about $$$ since i know what is a better choice. =)
i believe in *plUr* to the furthest i can take it took. i love everyone from
ppl i know and will soon meet or never meet. i am willing to help other
promoters in return for advice and help..same with djs and pas. if anyone is
interested pliiizzzzzzzzzzzzzzz email me privately...thanks in advance and
*plUr*

(john sweeney)

my opinion on bringing the uk djs is that first of all, you're only
bringing in tunes, b/c the great majority of the d&b djs ikn the uk
arent incredibly better djs skillwise than any good us dj.  they may
have some new tracks, but they get released in the us anyway.  grnated a
few exceptions for people like the rider, bryan g, fabio, and some
others that may have "exclusive" tracks but the majority of all the
tracks played get released.  So what I'm getting at is that it's pitiful
if someone says they are not going to go to a US jungle event unless
they get UK djs (and accepting the non UK DJs know how to DJ), because
theer just aint a big difference.  anyway, all the uk DJs play the same
tunes all the time.  so quit whinging.

MCs, however, are worth bringing over , but there are obvious reasons why.


	[*deep breath*
	
	same damn problem you get everywhere else...why do promoters book
keoki when great dj's like dust and your other awesome locals are able to spin
sets 10x better?

	exactly. it's "cool" to bring in uk guys...it makes it 'real',
right? :)

	don't get me wrong, im incredibly hyped that we can actually bring
in some of these guys (in case you were wondering, special k is a wicked
wicked dj, excellent mixing, no worries, and im not just saying that...many of
us here at scj are of the same 	opinion...just coz they happened to be born
on the other side of the pond doesnt make them good djs. we plan on
bringing in only quality djs, regardless of where 	they are
from), but big respect goes out to the people working hard w/o the name 
recognition or the big paychecks, doing it for the love of the music.

	there's a strong feeling among u.s. d 'n b djs/producers that its
time to do our own thing...to look at how the uk acheived their success and
emulate it with our own style...and most of the u.s. "heavyweights" are banding
together and going from the grass roots up and cooperating, so things
look good on the horizon.

	but, even after we reach the same level as our uk cousins, there's
still a special feeling to having a uk guest. a feeling perhaps that we are
connecting in some way to the original phenomenon that blew up the globe.
(whew, that sounded like a load of journalistic bullshit straight out of
urb ;) ...at the end of the day, you gotta ask yourself...was
it worth it? did i enjoy myself? was everyone having a good time?

	come find out...2.10.98]


peace+respect

howdy.

sorry to send out 2 message in a row, but i forgot something...

SCJ should try to get 1 or 2 uk headliners in and throw a regular old
RAVE. reasons:

* i'd definatly be able to go cuz it's on the weekend (same with other
high skoolers, who, as tome said, cant normally come during the week)
* you could charge as much as you needed to.
* you'd get the out of town crowd (and their money)
* the party wouldn't have to stop @ 2


	[would love to. have basic plans to. need $$. save your pennies
kids, coz we sure as hell arent getting rich at steelcitycentral. :)


	"daddy, can i have $15,000?" "WHY?!?!" "just cause...." :)]

Sine is absolutly underated as  a dj.
In my opinion Sine should be looked at just as any of the bigger american
circut jungle dj's or better!
His mixing skillz are supreme.the last time i heard him play was at a
cleveland event in the summer,he was playing jazzy smooth and
atmospheric....very nice set!

Sine is absolutly underated as  a dj.
In my opinion Sine should be looked at just as any of the bigger american
circut jungle dj's or better!
His mixing skillz are supreme.the last time i heard him play was at a
cleveland event in the summer,he was playing jazzy smooth and
atmospheric....very nice set!

most of the jungle djs from the uk are the originators.....the very
first people in the world to do the jungle thing......they are producers
of the original classic songs.....im just gonna point out, ive only
heard a few tapes of uk dj's live sets, but ive rarely if ever heard
anything as good from a us dj....i would LOVE to see mickey finn, dj
hype, ss, randall, kenny ken, even gr00\/rider......its just a different
deal altogether.......tell me you wouldnt want to hear bukem
live........i dont really like "inteligent jungle" that much, but he
works majik, and to see him with his plates would be a real
treat.....there are definitely us djs i wanna see too, such as dara and
3d, but you gotta give props to the originators too...like shy fx and
marvilious cain....do you think well ever see them here???? probably
not....:(
toM


[case in point: grooverider at (what was the name of that party...at the
old 'rise' space in bmore, it was groove, rap, tayla instead of bukem,
trace, gq...was it renegade? i forget) he absolutely STUNK. but under the
conditions (i was embarassed that was the first taste of the u.s. that most
of those djs had) i can understand...who else has sucked...trace too many
times to mention, but he's not a uk dj in my opinion any more :) anyhow,
the point is, yes: we've all had high hopes that this dj will spin a
godlike set just coz they are from the uk...but it doesnt necessarily
happen. i agree with tom on this: i have tapes of dj's form the uk that
were absolutely *smokin* but it doesn't always translate. from your list
above tho...ive heard wicked sets from ss and kenny ken here in the
states...
there's a party in toronto next weekend: mickey finn, darren jay, brockie,
mc det, fearless,  and lots more, including sniper, mystical influence,
marcus, etc...and pete heller and terry farley (or is it farley and heller?
:) from junior boy's own, uk...who wants to go (read: give me a ride :) one
of those wicked parties that toronto can throw (go check out the lineups
for the big $25 (thats canadian...more like $17.50 american) toronto
parties. infreakincredible.]

so, to sum it up...who wants to go to toronto next week? i can use my
"secret jungle connections" and guarantee youll have a blast...:P

finephunk essentially said:

djs dont give a rats ass to come over here...certain djs are overlooked in
the uk so they spin here, ie aphrodite, then hype says he wont come over...


[true...you gotta consider just how much bank these guys are clocking over
there, several parties a week (be they clubs, lounges, one-offs, etc.)

this isnt across the board, but the big names can spin out 4 times a week
at lets say 700 pounds average per gig...(some less, some much more)--the
current exchange rate makes that $1120 per gig x 4....so u see why a uk dj
won't necessarily want to miss out on at least 2 if not 3 gigs to come play
in the us for $1000 for 500 cracked out k-heads...who don't even *like*
jungle.
i don't blame hype for not wanting to come over...however he *does* go to
toronto which luckily is only 5 hrs away....(how many times have u driven
to dc/bmore for a party??) imagine, you could have gone to toronto, or even
detroit...(you wanna talk $$ richie hawtin 20,000 pounds to play live and i
think he's booked at least 4 times in '98. carl craig innerzone orchestra
23,000 pounds and 5 first class plane tickets to scotland...)

i've rambled enuff today :) have a great nite kids...]

  Dearest friend,
the common bond is music.
your local scene must find that bond.
We must recogonize that we are all equal.
We must let go of judgment and criticism.
we must realize we are one; a unified body.
As a unified body, we must look upon our
fellow ravers as brothers and sisters.
we must embrace each other
with pure compassion.
We must open our minds
to truth,
peace within,
and ultimately,
Love
we must open our minds
to the expression and celebration
of life.
We must open our eyes
to beauty and understanding.
We must look inside ourselves
to realize that we are
spiritual beings.
We must feel the bliss of inner self.
We must be free.

I'm nuts over them.  I first heard "experimental noises with random bursts
of sound" or an album with a title to that effect a few years ago.  They
have a cool internet site devoted to this art/music experiment they did.  I
have to agree, dots and loops was the best of 1997.

OK, now this annoys me greatly.  I hate when events like this one are
closed to over half, perhaps over 3/4, of the scene.  I am 19 years old
and I would really like to hear these people spin but this venue is closed
to me because it's in a bar!!  Besides, when did "Thee Instigator" turn
21?

I know this will probably get some people riled up, but I can't help the
way I feel.  Even if I was 21 now, I think I would feel the same as I do
now.
I've heard a lot of zippy things about Zythos, in fact people I've met
have done art work for the interior.  I can't see it, though, because I'm
not 21.  I hate this stupid drinking age.  Americans are such prudes!

Herm, I went there a few weeks ago, there's a small bar about the size of my
livingroom, and a back room about the size of my bedroom. The back room had
2 couches and this big ottoman thingy in it... i.e. there's no place to
dance. There were 2 other people there listening, and the 3 of us finally
pushed everything to the side and made enuf room for 2 ppl to dance...
bleah... I like just chilling and listening to music as much as the next
person, but I go out to Dance, or at least be able to if I wanna :) so in
short, Dont be so sad... I dont think you're missing a hell of alot.

Dan

Hands down, Stereolab is one of the most interesting bands out there.
For years, they've been redefining the face of themselves and the sounds
they create... each album has a distinct flavor and style.  I wouldn't
call it rock music.  I shan't call it electronica (hhahaha)... fucking
check them out..

Dots and Loops is a masterpiece.  Transient Random Noisebursts with
Announcements (as referred to below) is my personal favorite-- and will do
your head in.... all i can say about this band is that if you're open for
something else.. sheeeeit,,, tus band is like crack ;)

> I hate this stupid drinking age.  Americans are such prudes!

Word. ;P  The vast majority of this crowd is definitly represented by
those under the age of 21.  You leave that many people out then you leave
out a TON of vibe, and no amount of alcohol can make up for that.

Last night I came to the conclusion that the 21+ law for drinking has
pretty much crippled the american club scene.  I was on the phone talking
to a friend who had spent a year in london.  Well, anywayz he was
commenting on the fact that all our clubs over here are so ghetto where in
london they are huge wharehouse beautifuly furnished with multiple rooms,
djs, lights, bars and tons of happy punters.  In other words these clubs
have tons of moolah to spend and where does it come: alcohol!  Addmitedly,
I'm not a huge fan of booze, but without income from it any club is
crippled.  Not only that, our eligible club population (I'd say 16-28 or
so) is effectively split in half.  From my understanding (hossam, is this
true?) trying to have any underage club night is an extremely risky and
rarely profitable venture.  The worst part about this is that I can't even
imagine a solution (other than getting my ass outa the usa as quick as
possible) as no amount of raver bitching is going to change drinking laws
antime soon.  Still, if anyone wants company to drive up to toronto for a
weekend, lemme know.

ok, so my only problem with sine is that he doesn't always rock the
house. whether that is because he's doing scj every other week, so he's
not real excited by it, or if it's just the crowd that feels that way, I
don't know. I've seen him do a couple of weak sets there. but he always
tore it up at the actual parties that I've seen him at.

A friend of mine sent this too me....for those in Pittsburgh...you should be
able to relate to all of this:)  

Jason

<< YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN IN PITTSBURGH TOO LONG WHEN
  YOU:
 
  1.  Realize your favorite beer is Rolling Rock.
 
  2.  Find yourself using "yins" and no forms of "to be" when
  talking long distance to family members.
 
  3.  You know how to say and spell Duquesne.
 
  4.  Think $8 and under for two hours of parking downtown during
  the work week is a bargain.
 
 5.  Find yourself at a nice restaurant thinking "I'd rather be at
  Eat-N-Park so I could get a smiley face cookie."
 
  6.  Can sleep through the sirens in the neighborhood.
 
  7.  Visit Cleveland and notice how clean it is.
 
  8.  Believe that if you are making a left hand turn, you have the
  right of way when the light turns green, despite the oncoming
  traffic going straight. (The Pittsburgh Left)
 
  9.  Can't eat a sandwich or salad without french fries on it. (Primanti
 Bros.)
 
  10.  Don't think pop sounds funny.
 
 11.  Find that you are no longer scared of the people talking to
 themselves on the PAT bus.
 
 12.  Find that you finish all of your sentences with "en dat."
 
  13.  Find that the panhandlers on Pitt's campus know that you've
  graduated.
 
 14.  Pass up a fresh Norwegian salmon for perogies.
 
  15.  Think that having your car window smashed is natural air
  conditioning.
 
  16.  Took a vacation at Seven Springs (and liked it.)
 
 17.  Avoid strangers on Pitt's campus asking for directions to the
 Cathedral of Learning.
 
  18.  Check police brutality statistics in the neighborhood you
 about to move.
 
 19.  Think the Hill District isn't that bad.
 
 20.  Think the Three Rivers are swimable.
 
 21.  Think the hookers on Liberty Ave are a nice touch to the
  Cultural District.
 
 22.  Are wearing "jogging pant" when you aren't jogging.
 
  23.  Are wearing "tennis shoes" when you aren't playing tennis.
 
  24.  Really like your new apartment because the windows aren't as
  drafty and there are bars on them too.
 
  25.  Get up early on a Saturday to get the best produce in the Strip
  District.
 
  26.  Actually know where Blawnox is.
 
  27.  Wear your best flannel to the Top of the Triangle.
 
  28.  Hear you should eat salads when you're on a diet, but can't
  figure how they aren't fattening with fries on top.
 
  29.  Looked at houses in Fox Chapel.
 
  30.  Bought a house in Fox Chapel.
 
  31.  Think Chief's is a good bar.
 
  32.  Find Stillers and Penquins jerseys attractive.
 
 33.  Are willing to drive a half hour for Kennywood. >>

[I just want to pass on the DEFINITIVE information on these virii!]

        It turns out that this so-called hoax is very dangerous after all.
GOODTIMES will re-write your hard drive. Not only that, it will scramble any
disks that are even close to your computer. It will recalibrate your
refrigerator's coolness setting so all your ice cream goes melty. It will
demagnetize the strips on all your credit cards, screw up the tracking on your
VCR and use subspace field harmonics to scratch any CDs you try to play.

        It will give your ex-girlfriend your new phone number. It will mix 
Kool-Aid into your fishtank. It will drink all your beer and leave dirty socks 
on the coffee table when company comes over. It will put a dead kitten in the
back pocket of your good suit pants and hide your car keys when you are late
for work.

        GOODTIMES will make you fall in love with a penguin. It will give you
nightmares about circus midgets. It will pour sugar in your gas tank and shave
off both your eyebrows while dating your girlfriend behind your back and
billing the dinner and hotel room to your Discover card.

        It will seduce your Grandmother. It does not matter if she is dead,
such is the power of GOODTIMES; it reaches out beyond the grave to sully those
things we hold most dear.

        It moves your car randomly around parking lots so you can't find it.
It
will kick your dog. It will leave libidinous messages on your boss's voice
mail
in your voice! It is insidious and subtle. It is dangerous and terrifying to
behold. It is also a rather interseting shade of mauve.

        GOODTIMES will give you Dutch elm disease. It will leave the toilet
seat up. It will make a batch of Methamphetamine in your bathtub and then
leave
bacon cooking on the stove while it goes out to chase gradeschoolers with your
new snowblower. 

        Watch out for GOODTIMES!

I don't know how pgh could handle 2 jungle nights, but I'd sure like to
see it happen.  Thurs-Fri-Sat nite might do better, but i know that jungle
hasn't blown up that big to take those prime spots.

I think it might do ok, if it tries to tackle elements not always given
proper representation at SCJ - like the jazzier & atmospheric side of
tings, or on the other side, the happy breakbeat styles.

If the place only needs 100-200 to float, it might do alright anyway.

Of course, who knows in pgh...attendance of anything is so goofy.

Yeah, I would definetely appreciate more representation of the more
"intelligent" styles of jungle.  And considering that people say there
isn't much space to dance, it could work real well. (Even though
personally I like to dance to such types of jungle even more)  Maybe
even play some Squarepusher and Plug like stuff, which seem to be
completely taboo among DJs.

Hey Kids,

Sorry for the wasted bandwidth. This party is in the PB-CLE Rave-o-matic
but I wanted to call it to the attention of anyone in the
Akron/Cleveland area. It hasn't been publicised very much but it is the
first event since the return of Brian from UPS to Ohio. There are going
to be some phhhaaattt tunes going down at this event. Anyone who read
High-R Frequencies review of FA3 and Hesohi's tape will know that Jordan
and Hesohi will not disappoint. Please pardon the shameless plug for
Jordan, one of High-R Frequencies writers. I have heard him play twice,
and always love his morning sets. But I hadn't heard him in a while and
forgot just how much I liked him. Well, he and Odyssey (never heard of
him until now) just sent me about 6 diff. mixtapes. They are ALL good!
Odyysey throws out some of the best deep house I have heard. Jordan, a
UPS favorite, is very versatile, but def. has that Cali sound. Combine
that w/his tribally groove and the dancefloor is in for some groove! 

Wish I lived closer, I'd see ya' there!


the first ohio UPS event since FA3....

Ohio Underground Peace Society Presents:

In  regards to all the shit about evil tech step.  I hate it. 

It is good music if you want to crawl up in the corner and go completely
fucking mental but it isn't party music and that's what I go to hear . .
. I go to have a good time, not shit my pants and go home a paranoid
schizo.

Man . . . If I could find out about this shit with some advance notice, I
would fucking be there.  I say advance notice because I would have to
make up some elaborate plan to tell my parents I was going on a trip
somewhere or something . . . but something would have to be done if I
could see all those people!!

Ok, there seems to be a bit of a mess here based on some of the things my
partner has said, let me try to clear a bit of that up.  

Rob Sherwood -
I sincerely apologize to you for anything that my partner said that came off
as insulting your event.  You have been nothing short of extremely cool with
us, and I've always had a great time at Pleasure.  When my partner said what
he did, he worded it very badly.  After talking with him, I believe his
problem was not with your event, but his frustration with the Cleveland
crowd only showing up in large numbers when a special guest is featured.
You have brought some great talent into the city, and drawn huge crowds, it
just stinks that people won't show up any where near as much to support the
great locals you also feature at Pleasure.  By mentioning consistancy as the
theme, (again, worded badly) I believe he was referring to our attempt at
trying to feature a special guest at our club every week, in hopes we will
be able to keep a decent crowd, especially for something not as already
established as your wednesday night.  Again, I am sorry for anything that
offended you, and thank you for all the support you have given us.

Steve Cinch -
First of all, let me say I did not want to be in competition with you.  When
I found out about Real, and after our conversation at my day job, I was
seriously considering cancelling Future, and trying to do something else.
Unfortunately, too many commitments had already been made, and there was no
turning back.  We mean no disrespect to you or your events by what we're
trying to do.  As far as Jeff's insinuating that our gig is something that
hasn't been done before, is not really 
to say other area clubs haven't brought in great out of town talent, but
that we plan on doing it every week, and will keep growing as much as
possible.  We already have a date in April to bring OPTICAL from METALHEADZ,
PROTOTYPE, AND MOVING SHADOW from the UK, and in May, ED RUSH from NO
U-TURN, METALHEADZ, MOVING SHADOW, etc.  What we are stressing is not that
we are the first club in Cleveland to feature large-scale talent, but
hopefully the first to feature it every single week, with out fail.
Hopefully that will be enough to hold these kids interest.  We'll see...

Greta -
Most of what you misunderstood has already been explained.  Let me just say
this; For a successful club night to work at an existing club/bar, not only
do you need attendance, but you need people buying alchohol.  As most of you
know, our crowd are not big drinkers.  Club 1148 usually makes the majority
of their money on the bar, and they figured the best way draw a drinking
crowd on Sundays was to advertise on 92.3, and 107.9.  Jeff and I wrote a
script that pretty much just laid out what was going on, all the cheese was
added by the production staff at 92.3.  At first I thought it was way too
much, but after thinking about it, it was perfect in trying to appeal to the
station's listening audience.  Sorry that there might be people there that
you don't want to be with, but it's something that everyone will have to
deal with for a club night to be successful.  I thought we were supposed to
be a tolerant group...:)

All others who have commented - 
Yes, Trilogy already exists, and I will be the first to admit is is the
coolest venue in the city.  Unfortunately, they don't do anything all that
fun on Sundays anymore.  They have been resting on their laurels too long,
and if the competition is stirring them up a bit, and causing them to
promote more, and feature some guests again, I think that's great.
As far as the comments about us not having any personal investment in the
club, let me tell you exactly what our deal is.  We do not have to pay for
the venue, lights, sound, security, or anything else relating to the club's
normal operation.  What we are responsible for is everything in relation to
the talent.  DJ fees, plane tickets, hotel rooms, transportation around
Cleveland, food, as well as the flyers.  We get a large portion of the
cover, and the club makes most of their money on the bar (which is why we
need a drinking crowd if we want to keep doing this.)  We have personally
invested over $6000 just for February, pretty much wiping out both of our
savings, so the answer is we definately have a large personal financial
interest in how everything turns out.

We have a few main reasons for attempting this night:

1. To feature great out of town talent each and every week that the people
of Cleveland want to see, and bring people that we personally would like the
chance to see in the city.

2. To feature as much as we can in the way of local talent, hopefully in
March, one a week.  Send us a message either through our email or the
voicemail line at 216-556-1488 / option 3 if you are interested.

3. To be able to play on a regular basis ourselves :)

4. To have something fun to do on Sunday nights again without spending $10

Again, nothing but respect and thanks go out to all the promoters that have
given us advice, and let us promote at their events, we will certainly
reciprocate if you'd like to promote at ours.  Any further comments and/or
criticism is quite welcome.  

My $.02,
Aaron Pearl

this is what worries me.  sunday isn't a good night, buts its the only
night when not serving alcohol makes $ense.  the space is too small to
divide into drinking/non-drinking.  maybe it could be bi-weekly opposite
scj or monthly.  why doesnt somebody take over the stock
exchange/icon/cairo or whatever the name of the month is for the former
gay now blues club downtown.  its an amazing space.

this is what saint and sine have been doing on tuesdays at zythos when
steel city is dormant.  they've been playing records they don't play out
at scj or parties, but work with the small, ambient space.  again
though, its 21+ :(

i'm glad people are interested in this.

I think the "fence sitters" would pay a couple more bills as well.  I
mean its onyl four bucks more.  Maybe you could offer everyone over 21 a
free drink or something.  I know I would pay a whole lot more than $8 to
hear skibadee, but that's just me :)

Any chance Sine will play a jump-up set in honor of this occasion instead
of tech-step/rollers?

OK, here's what's up.  Recently Sine isn't all that good . . . yeah his
mixing is extremely tight, BUT his selection isn't.  His selection just
doesn't seem to get the crowd going.  I have seen him tear shit up though
with evil stuff at the begining of the summer of 97.  People were
screaming "We love you Sine!" and holding lighters and shit.  So you
aren't the only one.

PS-I know the person that wrote that last message and have heard him say,
"I want to give Sine head." :)

I noticed this last night on Hyperreal. It's a sad day for people who
like ecstasy...


NICHOLAS SAUNDERS, author of E is for Ecstasy and Ecstasy and the

I was thinking about starting a WEB BASED chat room and I was
wondering what ppl would think about it. I know that there are several
rave/techno chats out there some being web based but havent to many
frequent chatters. Please post what you think about it and remember
this is still just an idea so dont think im trying to steal your
visitors if you already have a WEB BASED chat room.
Thank you for your time.

This brings up a point that I've been thinking alot about recently.  The
DJs vibe in his actions as well as his DJing.  I went to Biz and John
Bromage was so happy to be playing his set and he was so excited and so
into it and it made all that much of a difference.  Where as Hazey and
Hipp-E weren't into and weren't feeding off the crowd.  I know when I
play out I'm going to be attempting to get the crowd as excited as
possible, cause that's what its all about.  Its not about sitting up at
the decks, trying to look good.  

I understand that not all DJs are going to put as much energy as John B
and Robert De Lawhatever do, BUT a little more than just cueing the songs
would be nice.

ABSOLUT

Dark, evil or gangsta tech step is the most fucking wicked music
I've heard in a long time.  Shy FX played a set of it at Return to
Wonderland in Chicago last summer and I danced so hard I thought my
head was going to blow off.

Music that gets inside your mind and fucks with you is sometimes the
very best.  It's certainly not passive.  It's invasive.  And you're
almost forced to deal and interact with it or be driven away.

That to me, is good music.  And a _great_ dancing environment.

agreed.  while i like my happy go lucky naive party music a ton!....
i can really get into so evil deadly tekstep big time.  

i can't recomend enuff the compilation on force inc called "position chrome".
it's a collection of german tekstep, that in my opinion, blows the uk to hades!
watch out for panacea...he's awesome.  get his new album "low profile darkness"
and call up ozzy ozzborne to cum over.

love,

personally, i like music that builds itself up and then goes nuts, which 
tech doesnt normally do....i like the tech stuff that has beats all over 
the place and sounds really crazy, but i dont like the same two step 
beat over and over with the same stupid bass filter.....it really grates 
on my nerves.....anyway, im out

I can respect your point of view, but to me the 'darkness' expressed in
jungle/techstep whatever isn't about fear or paranoia.  Its more about
drawing out a different kind of energy.  The darkside isn't necessarily
bad or evil.  In the end of Return of the Jedi we learn that darth vader 
is a mortal too - the dark side is just like the rest of us.  If you check
out Ed Rush or Trace, alot of there stuff is on the cyberpunk/dystopian
tip, but still has alot of energy to it (amtrak, mutant, replicants, etc...).
If you haven't read any cyberpunk books check out Neuromancer (William
Gibson) or Snowcrash (Neil Stephenson)...you'll see where alot of the
darkside/tech stuff is coming from...

When you layer the darkstuff with jazzy stuff, synthy ambient stuff,
hip-hop flavor, sci-fi steppers, funk rinse outs - its just an awesome
crossecti of elements (fire,water,earth,air) and emotions that can't be
matched in any other music.  And you can dance to it too. ;)

I wish more djs would move around styles in their sets instead of being
exclusively one 'style' (although that's all good sometimes).

somehow i never know how to end these emails.

Yes if could be held in a space other than wash co. Fair grounds. 
This is a virgin space... what the heck does 80,000 watts have to do with
the space. Plus 80,000 is the combined strength of both rooms. 
Prepare for a space with instavibe.

Subject: |NER| Studio Liquidation Sale! 909, 808, 303


Hello,

Our studio's too damn cramped and filled with
stuff we really don't need or want anymore, so
we're liquidating some goodies in order to finace
buying a couple of big-ticket items instead. All
items are in excellent working condition and very
good cosmetic condition. All prices are listed in
Canadian and US dollars (rounded).


- Atari Mega-4 with colour & B&W monitor,
  Cubase 2.0, Cubase 3.1
--> $400 CDN, $300 US

- Roland TR-909
--> $1100 CDN, $800 US

- Roland TR-808
--> $900 CDN, $650 US

- Roland TR-727
--> $250 CDN, $175 US

- Roland TB-303 with carrying case & manual
      --> $1100 CDN, $800 US

- Alesis Midiverb II effects
--> $200 CDN, $150 US

- A-frame keyboard stand
--> $50 CDN, $35 US


Please contact Jeff at algorithm@techno.ca (not me) for
details or to make any offers. You can also reach him
by phone at 416.340.0051. It would obviously be a lot
easier if we found local buyers (Toronto), but otherwise
buyer pays shipping.

I regret to inform you that plans have been changed.  Your suggestion is
what has actually already been done, and the original promoters who worked
out the deal have changed who they are bringing.  My understanding is that
the 2 DJ's now coming will be DJ DIE from V RECORDINGS / FULL CYCLE, and
FIERCE from RENEGADE HARDWARE.  As you can see, just as exciting, if not
better then the original plan.  Personally, I'm more excited about seeing
Die here, but still sorry about the change.  Fierce plays a wicked techstep
set though, probably 50% or more plates from last I saw him...  Check it out...

i know this style is what's new and upfront, and that's what people
seem to care most about when it comes to jungle, but people who spin
dark shit dont get the crowd movin' in comparison to a half-decent
jump-up dj (i can think of a few). this probably isn't the case in
most parts of the us (and definatly not the the world) but as far as
crowd response goes, jumpup is what pgh wants. i would be a truly
happy guy if pittsburgh became known as "the jumpup capital of the US"
(remember that back in the day shit about it being "the jungle capital
of the US? times have changed, eh?). anyways, this may be a pipe
dream, but i know that absolut + i are gonna try our hardest to push
it in that direction, so all massive get ready... a new dawn is
approaching.

yeah you're right, you have to stay in business, so for clientele you take
what you can get. and the more hype + cheese you use is better if you want
to attract people who are slaves to popular music and mainstream media.
sorry if i had sounded so negative, i might check out the night sometime
if i can find a ride there, to see what it's about. the music's more
important than anything else anyway.

this is my review of we can't be stopped.

it was held at the roller skating rink + when i got there it was about
10:45 but nobody was being let in yet, so me + some friends went to the BP
+ bought liquor + started drinking in the car. then we hooked up with matt
from lovelight who was running the lights & finally we went in and started
setting up lights (so we didn't have to wait in line + nobody paid
admission, which is ok since their (the promoters') past isn't that
un-shady + matt needed the help).

then the woman who owned the place or whatever came storming across the
floor + started yelling about "is this one of those teenage rage things?"
(what the fuck?) nick (the promoter) said no "it's just a dance". she said
the sherriff just found out about this and there's a runaway juvenile with
drugs who is on his way here. and she said some other stuff like "i could
shut this thing down so fast it would make your head spin!" (ooh i was
scared, haha) anyway i heard the kid was caught outside later that night. 

then the music didn't even start until 12:30 and people we being let in.
there were so many "fashion raver" (remember that post?) types of people
there, but there were also plenty of cool people there, so it was ok. what
is weird in kind of a bad way is this girl came up to me + asked me "have
you seen any drugs around?" not e, acid, crystal, whatever, just any old
drugs apparently, not picky at all. i didn't ask her if she was looking
for crack. ;) but i hooked her up anyway (with acid not crack!).
 
i don't know who the first DJ was but he was spinning breaks (and not
that well) that were so slow they were almost like trip hop. it was very
unconducive to dancing, + practically nobody was dancing. then james
temple went on + on the flyer it said he was a techno DJ which implies
that he would spin techno but he was spinning this monotonous trancey
house music, so that was disappointing, but at least i could dance to it.
then rob went on + started spinning jungle + there was this huge cheer,
people were actually dancing, and there were at least 50 people crowded
around him watching, because he was scratching all over the place +
pulling off some neat tricks. i called for the rewind + he rewound but i
was the only person yelling rewind so i gave up after awhile, but i still
jumped around everywhere cheering. then nick when on the mic + i thought
he was going to mc but he was talking to rob + it seems like they had this
thing planned out so rob stopped the music + nick said a bunch of
egotistical gangster-sounding things about how wonderful his crew was,
he's like this suburban-type kid (and white by the way) not a gangster at 
all, then he would ask some stupid question + then rob would use some
dj-rectangle-record-sample to answer it. this happened for like 5
minutes twice in the set. it was really dumb. i didn't think rob would
stoop to that level of cheeseballness. the next dj was danny da wildchild.
his record selection was pretty good, but his mixing and tricks were
nothing special.

by then it was about 3:30 + my friends were throwing an afterhours in
akron + i was supplying the turntables + mixer so we left early to go set
everything up. when we got to the house, there wasn't any table to put the
turntables on. so i put a door on top of 4 kitchen chairs and put a coffee
table on top of the door and the turntables + mixer on top of the coffee
table, then propped everything up with pieces of cardboard so it didn't
fall over. it was the most ghetto rigged sort of set up, it was really
funny, but it worked + the records never skipped. the party went from 5am
to 4pm, and probably 100 people were there so it was pretty successful.
these 2 people i know came there from the "official afterhours" that nick
was running & said it was "wack", held in a little bar, and that they had
to pay $3 to get in. i think that's a crock of shit charging people money
for the afterhours party, in a seedy bar, nonetheless, especially when the
original party was $10.

I am posting again because last post there was only 2 replies 1 for
and 1 (against) the web based chat room.
In case you dont know I was thinking about putting up an web based
chat room and was wondering if I do put it up how many or if anyone
would chat there.
1 idea I was given was for an IRC chat but since there are already a
few irc chats like this and many havent access to IRC chat and another
I like irc but feel it isnt as personal.
well anyhow PLEASE post your feelings about the chat room idea.
Thank You
E-REX
PS: Sorry I wrote so much.

hello all this is my first post...i'm a pittsburgh raver...kind of new 
to the scene
the idea of a chat room is good...over my christmas break...i tried to 
get some
people into pre-established..i would enter raver rooms and no one was 
there
i would leave a post with my e-mail add....saying to contact me to 
chat...i got a few
responses...
here's the problem..i'm a busy college student....the only time i could 
really
chat is on the weekends but of course this is when i'm at parties...and 
so is everyone
else...
so i'm saying its a good idea and i'd like to see it but...i just don't 
think 
that i and many others could take advantage of it very often...just some 
of 
my thoughts...
by the way i'm looking for a ride to g-spot on the 14th...i go to 
slippery
rock university....i could probably get a ride to pittsburgh however...i 
have
a potential ride but he's sort of unreliable...gas money etc would be 
provided

thanks
little sarah

Nicholas Saunders and Rick Doblin (who's actually the founder of MAPS
- Multidesciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) also wrote
Ecstasy - Dance, Trance, & Transformation...a very informative book
w/ color inserts of some of the caps & tabs with exactly how much pure 
MDMA & how much bunk is being sold on the streets today...

The book kicks off with Saunder's personal experience to the history of 
the drug since its birth in 1912 as a diet drug by the German company 
Merck to 1953 when the U.S. Army tested it as an agent for psychological 
warfare to its rediscovery by Alexander Shulgin who used it as a tool for
psychotherapy to its golden age in the US market in the late 70's and early 
80's to how it fueled the raves on the island of Ibizia in 1987 and 1988 in
Europe...

Other interesting sections include an interview with an actual manufacturer
(who concluded that it was too too difficult and too dangerous - due to an
explosion during the Ritter reaction)...a section on the different types of
music today with quotes from the purveyors of each genre of music...a 
section of descriptions of the different scenes throughout the US including
a behind the scenes look of the largest rave ever in the US - Ravestock at
Woodstock '94 with an attendance of 75,000 (not to be confused with the
less successful Ravestock '95 in Iowa) written by Scotto himself (his frank
and graphic descriptions convey all the headache and heartache and the
ultimate sense of pride from putting together a party of such imense
dimensions)...and of particular interest is the section of personal accounts
from those who have used it for depression, intimacy, easing death, over-
coming cocaine addiction, pain relief, seduction, and spiritual awakening...

if anything i hope Mr. Saunder's death will provoke those who do choose 
to experiment with psychedelics to educate themselves before ingesting
any ole pill that may come their way...

Lately everyone has been for the idea but worried about not having
anyone there.  That was my first concern from the beginning because
ive only seen several rave chats that were online and none of them had
anyone in them.  I now have the page were that room will be linked
form and I am sending to several search engines I am also putting it
in guest books and mailing ppl to see if they will put up a link.
Within the next day or 2 I am going to mail all of the lists with the
adress. Hopefully we can even get an chat gathering set up on a day
that has nothing much going on.  Soon we will see exactly if anyone
will chat there but first I want to advertise more so that this isnt a
lost cause.

Thank You

i have established #pb-cle-raves on irc using either irc.primenet.com or
irc.emory.edu (but you can use any efnet server you want). all you need to
do is go to www.mirc.com or www.mircx.com ...either one would show you how
to download irc. hopefully you can figure things out! i also have a bot on
there so the channel will be protected. =)

Just a reminder that Phantom 45 and Danny the Wildchild will both be performing
extended sets at FUTURE in Cleveland tonight.  Admission is once again only $6. 
I recommend that people get there early, as Phantom 45 is expected to start
around the 11:30 time frame.  There is also potential for a tag team set as
well depending on how they feel about it.  Hope to see you all there! :)

Stephenson is a genius...I'm just finishing "The Diamond Age", Snow Crash
was def too... Oh by the way, Cutup, I really enjoyed your set a couple
of weeks ago at SIP (we met briefly after your set).  That was the first
time I was ever really exposed to Gabber styles (stuff sounds like the
musical definition of frustration, very interesting) I couldn't help but
think that it would be the perfect soundtrack to an indi film about
working too much...

I thought he died in an auto accident.  Nowhere have I seen that the
wreck was linked to drug, or particularly in this case, MDMA use.

I think a pb-cle or midwest/northeast web chat room would be cool...i
figure not everyone has irc access or unix knowhow, but a greater % have
web access (isn't that odd).  I'd check it out, but of course, i don't
think everyone is always on line at once.

where in the world did i ever say his death WAS linked to drug use?

if anything i pointed out the man spent a considerable amount of his
life trying to educate and inform the public about the drug, it would
be nice if those who do choose to partake in psychedelics to educate
themselves by reading one of the many books or visiting the web site 
that he spent so much of his life working on before just popping any 
pill and not knowing the effects or how to handle the effects or the 
consequences of the effects or even lack of effects because they've

Hey all, 

It's me agian, and I know that we all wore this topic thin a few weeks ago,
but I heard that G-Spot got moved to an old Forest City.  I wanted to know if
anyone had heard that this was the case, or what.  I'm as skeptical as the
next person concerning the shadiness surrounding this party, so don't yell at
me for starting a rumor or anything.

Well kats,
	
	I went to Hullabaloo.  Yep, sure did.  I left Friday with friends
of mine, for Canada.  I don't know about anybody else, but we had no
problem crossing the border.  We got in to Toronto around 3:30am and then
we went to the Golden Griddle, it was kind of like Eat'n'Park.  The next
day we kicked around Toronto and I just have to say, I LOVE that city.  I
mean, I wouldn't want to live there, but it is one hell of a place to
visit!
	That night, we walked to the party because it was only eight
blocks from our hotel.  We stood in line for maybe a half hour so that
wasn't too bad.  When we got in, we checked out coats and the money from
the coat-check was going to a charity.  It sounded on the up'n'up but I
don't remember what charity.  It was still kind of refreshing.  Next to
the coat check, they had a sign in for different lists around in the
general vicinity.  I think ne-raves and mw-raves was on it, but we
weren't, hmmm.  
	There was a huge black drop dividing the huge space in half.  I
think it was also a blanket for the sound because the main room was the
hardcore room and the second room was the house/trance room.  On the side
opposite the main room, there were various venders, including a safe sex
awareness table, two smart drink tables, a candy/glowstick table, and a
jewelery table.  Behind the tables, on a platform was a huge screen with
what looked like a video game playing.  I couldn't tell if people were
actually playing, which would have been cool, or if it was just a video
loop.  In the second room, there was a bubble machine and early in the
night it was pointed towards one spot on the floor.  It made a big bubble
puddle.  People tracked bubbled stuff into the main room.  Some people
like being able to slide, but I'd rather have the traction. 
	I suppose I should preface this with: I am not a dj critic.  I
can't tell one trick from the next.  I only go by the vibe I'm getting
from the crowd. 
	That said, I guess I liked the three djs I heard well enough.
There were three hardcore sets in a row.  I can't remember the first two,
but the third was Anabolic Frolic.  The crowd was absolutely wild for the
second and third...whistles blaring.  I was a bit annoyed because I heard
one or two of the same tracks in all three first sets.  I liked that
particular track, I even know the words, but there were a whole bunch of
other things I would have like to hear!  Where is d.Cypol when you need
him?!
	The two mc's I heard were freaking amazing.  I didn't know which
ones they were either, but they were both pretty cool.  The first one
though, and this was sort of annoying, kept shouting, "you fucking
lightweights" about the whistling.  It was a bit ridiculous after a while.
The second one I was wild about!!  He made scratching sounds with his
MOUTH!!  It was so amazing!  I really liked him.  His words and rhythms
were really nice!!
	We were supposed to have a net meet after Anabolic Frolic's set
and I waited around towards the front looking conspicuous, but no one came
up to me.  No one told me what they looked like or what they were wearing,
or at least not enough to distinguish them from any other random raver.  I
was a bit annoyed.
	I was more aware of the drugs at this party than I have every been
at ANY other party I have ever been to, period.  In ten minutes, five or
six people came up to me and asked me if I wanted E, acid, crystal, pot,
and K.  One girl asked me twice in one minute if I wanted some E and both
times I said no.  Maybe she was hoping I changed my mind, too bad for her!
It wasn't a bad vibe alert, just an observation.  After this party, I've
come to the realization that pot smells like skunk so why anyone would
want to do that is beyond me.
  	Please don't get me wrong.  This wasn't a bad party, it just
wasn't phenomenol.  Maybe it was because I was lonely or maybe it was
because I was exhausted, but it just didn't leave an orgasmic impact which
is what I sort of expected.  Frankly, the shoes I bought that evening were
more exciting than the party.  Maybe I'm old and bitter, but I decided to
leave around 4am.  Someone get me an IV.  I better stop now because the
more I think about it the more bitter I get.  I had a lot of fun this
weekend but it was because I was with friends I love and I made new
friends and I got to go to my favorite city.  Now that this doesn't have
any rhyme or reason, I'm going to go.
Bye,
Jenifer Foulmood

Hi, 

Are there any techno fans on this list? I am writing an article about
techno (as in the style, not "electronica") for *High-R Frequencies*
magazine. High-R is publishing a series of articles on each of the main
styles of underground dance music. They have already covered House and
Jungle. Now it is time for Techno to take the spotlight! 

I am already interviewing a few well-known techno DJs but I could use
your help in trying to convey "the essence" of techno. Its not going to
be easy, but I am hoping some of you, especially DJs who spin it, or
anyone who is a really "addicted," will take a few minutes to answer the
following questions. The best responses will be included in the article. 

1. How do you define techno? What differentiates it in your mind from
other forms of electronic music?

2. What is it about techno that you like so much? (Whats your favorite
aspect of the music, what really grabs you?)

3. Describe one of your most memorable Techno experiences (spinning,
dancing, producing, whatever). 

4. Who are some of the hottest Techno DJs right now (U.S. and other
countries), in your opinion. Some labels/records (old & new) for newbies
to check out. 

5. Give a short description of yourself, your name, how you are involved
with the scene and Techno specifically, what style of Techno is your
favorite, etc.

You can answer some or all, but I need all responses this week. Many
thanks for your help! I will try to compile a summary of the best
replies and repost them to this list, too. 

Watch for *High-R Frequencies* Transmission #5, FREE at stores and
parties near you. Also, pick up a copy at the *Winter Music Conference,*
Miami, Florida, March 7-11, 1998.

okay kiddies.....i liked this party...phat vibe great muzik and NICE 
people.....sorry bout the net meet jennifer, but i was entranced at the 
time:)...anyway, i think i heard almost every happyhardcore track that i 
love....didnt know the first dj, but he was okay....frisky was 
next..lots o' anthems...toytown, etc....next was anabolic frolic...more 
good stuff....spotty mixing at times, some not beatmatched, but not 
often...he really fucked up the dance floor...then dj brisk....no 
anthems there, great mixing, good selection of stuff that i really wasnt 
familiar with.....the first 5 hours were happy hardcore:) the 
mc's.....e-by-gum, was basically alright, some really fast flows in 
white guy british style, he reverted a bit too much to the whistle 
crew(which, becuz of the fact that they gave out free whistles at the 
door, was in FULL effect, to the point of irritation at times...)the 
scratch guy (dont remember his name) was PHAT...at one point he engaged 
in call and response scratchin with dj brisk....so 
cool......anyway...after that i basically passed out due to 
exhaustion...but i haerd some of medicine muffin's set...older stuff 
like super sharp shooter and the like....nice.....we brought lots of 
toys(parachute guys, punchin baloons, gas masks, and other random stuff) 
which was alot of fun...the people there were so nice, it was 
amazing...apart from one little scuffle/fistfight thing i saw, it seemed 
like everyone was really happy to be there....there were more people 
dancing to happy hardcore there than there are at some pittsburgh 
raves...i mean, it was an event catered to exactly the styles i like, 
the vibe was awesome, and the mixing good.....it would have been better 
if i had gotten more sleep before we went so i could have been up all 
night, but i learned my lesson and ill get motre sleep b4 i go to the 
next hullabaloo, which is in april.....BUT i will be in toronto this 
weekend for mickey finn and brockie and the like, so ill put up a review 
of that too.....peace, 
toM

big respect to dronetek and crew for putting on a tight party in columbus
on sat nite...well over 500 kids came out that nite and they were
absolutely havin' it...


i'll skip the review of whatever that was that titonton and monchrome did
(if you aint got nuthin good to say...) and skip to the good stuff.

big up dj troll for saving us all with a nice set up hardstep and
jumpup...shout out to ria/mogli for the mc work, and respect to the kid on
the dance floor who asked me to pass the mike...i told him if he wanted it
he had to come up on stage, and after a minute, he did...laid down a few
lines of g-style rappin...gotta give him props for steppin up. nice1

then andy/sine came one and laid down a *tight* set of hardstep and non
droney tecchy shit...(btw, mr sine has read all the comments on the list
and il be posting a reply in his own words in the near future)

rounding it out was our very own dj squared, who took things from the dark
and into the smooth...we were fading fast, so we jetted immediately
thereafter, had breakfast (thanks randy! ;) and when i opened my eyes i was
back on good old forbes ave. in oakland...


again, a wicked first event by the dronetek crew, look for another event
come late may featuring a metallic uk dj :)


peace,
hossam

I didn't even hear about it or I would have.  Where there fliers for it? 
 Sounds like I missed out on something cool again!

Word up, Hossam.  I thought Andy and I were the only sane people at that 
party; the only people who could distinguish between good skills and crap! 
 Is there anyone else out there who has the good sense to realize what a 
jack-off that guy was?

massive...

just wanted to warn you about this character named 'kira huntzinger'

kira is notorious for picking her nose in public, and often sings puffy
daddy tracks at the top of her lungs in the shower ("thought i told u that
we wont stop...").

she should be considered armed and dangerous.

approach with extreme caution.


ferreal tho, kira's aight :)

buy her a drink tonite at scj and ask her to show you her tatoo...which one
she shows you depends on how much she likes you ...;)


FOR THE EXTREMELY DUMB PEOPLE OUT THERE THIS WAS A SARCASTIC JOKE AND SHOULD
BE TAKEN AS HUMOR.

hi kira! :)

peace,

[superstar mc sphinx]

if you want to be cool and hang with kira and i, it'll cost you.

i drink corona's and amaretto sours...stay away from the long island iced
teas..that tall white kid cant make a drink to save his life. when he asks
for a tip tell him 'learn how to make a drink, stringbean.'

leave the crack in the car kids. (this message brought to you by the
happysunshine plur crew...compliments of hossam and kira)

 peace,
 hossam >>

I was at that show!!!  I got to all of the Blue Eyed Soul Shows.  There we're
many people but everyone that was there had a great time.  When special guest
"Blaze" from "The Flow Band" started MCing...I was blown away!!!!!!!  For all
of you who have never gone to a B.E.S. show...You should.  It's a great time
and a fun show.

Like Hossam was saying....they've got 3 MC's (actually 4 but ones touring
Europe right now:), a guitarist, a bassist, a drummer, and a D.J.  Their D.J.
is DJ Blur......alot of people know him as DJ Phoenix.  When he's out at a
party he spins the best Happy Hardcore!!!!!!!!!!!!!  B.E.S. is playing out at
The Four Seasons Banquet House this friday night, Feb. 13th.   If anyone needs
directions just let me know and I'll email them to you.   Have a nice
day!!!!!!!!

Jason

 As for that German guy......I guess you're talking about Blaze...he was a bit

liked it:)

Just a reminder that the Inaudible radio/webcast is broadcasting
all the latest and greatest techno & house music tonight and every
wednesday from 9-11 pm eastern standard time on FM 89.3 WCSB. 

During the Inaudible show we will be giving away promo 12"s 
and cds so yet another reason to tune in. 

If you prefer to listen over the internet you can do so. The 
show will be accessible by visiting http://www.wcsb.org
every Wednesday from 9-11 pm EST. The show will be broad-
cast in the AudioActive format (which is actually much
better than RealAudio). You can download the Audio Active
plugin for free at http://www.audioactive.com/player/

If you need any more info email us at bcrayon@bentcrayon.com

Hi...I tried to post this earlier from work, but it doesn't seem to

Peabodies!!!!!!! (And there was MUCH rejoice!)  I have no idea 
exactly where it will be, but the info line says it is NOT, lemme

We'd would be interested in booking your DJ's for our upcoming parties if 
we knew: A. who they are  and B. what they sound like.  If you want to get 
them out here you should hook us up with some tapes and such.
If you're down, send any tapes/info to:

Sessions
c/o Kira@ChemIcon Inc.
7301 Penn Avenue
Pittsburgh, PA  15208

We'll take a listen and go from there.  This also goes for anyone else 
trying to get booked in Pgh.
Peace-
Kira, Andy, & Dustin

Figured id squirt out a few thoughs on last night's SCJ - 
Overall it was excellent and 'i had a good time.
  
Saint was on point with some grindin' industrial darkstep early in the
evening...its a weird style that he's spinnin' these days...very
interesting, but not dancehall rockin.

I must say, big respect to Alaska, who's been coming strong with nice
selections - always a bit of technology and a bit of the funk. I couldn't
believe that more people weren't up for him, but i did think the crowd was
sluggish overall on the night.

Then Special K + Skibadee...should we believe the hype? ;)
Everyone was havin' it for the first half of the set, but after 1.5 hours
of the lowkey bassline bombers, i think people were a lickle worn out on
the sound.  SPecial K's dj flow was awesome in the first half...he seemed
pretty crowd responsive...i just think people got tired. 

Now i must say Skibadee rocks the place with amazing lyrical style...even
if the beats weren't makin' me spin, i was still bouncin' to his sticatto
vocal gymnastiques.  I'v only seen a handfull of uk mc's live, but
Skibadee was def on top of them.  I wish we had this element at every
event!

Were people disappointed at the turnout?  It seemed only slightly above
average, but its hard to tell because some people lurk the whole time.
I'd like to see more UK talent here, but better yet, I'd like to see a us
team/act (mc/dj/singer + whatever else) with as much flow.

I'v heard good things about the substitution crew - any chance of hooking
up with them?

anyway, that's it fer now. shouts out to all the netravers in
attendance/that said hi (however brief) - mike, hossam, sheri, absolut,
hell, even that punk tom zox. ;)

l8s,
 the instantaneous cutup

I thought I posted a follow up message to this, but maybe it got lost in
the mail (juno can be fucked up at times).  Here is my post from before:

the situation is that >Rachel (the girl throwing it) has transferred the

Stuff like that.  The Beastie >Boys will come on at 4:20!!!!!!!!  And all

I saw her last night and she didn't say anything like "Man, I can't find
a space" or anything else bad in anyway, so as of now it is on.

"Techno is the sound of digital technology speaking to us, asking to be
set free, begging, demanding. Techno is the symphony of the digital
revolution. Techno soothes, subdues and then on occasion tries to byte
your head off." --Me, right now. :)

On the technical definition though.  Usually contains wide variety of
samples, obviosly synthetic or synthetically manipulated. Or extremely
pure notes. Something that simply could not be generated by a natural
instrument.  

The beat can be anything, usually rythmic, I would almost say it has to
be rythmic, have a patern of somesort, even if its a complex pattern
that we cant notice without reading the code.  

I would say its key to point out that most of the techno revolution was
a spinoff of the sound backing for early Amiga and PC games.  Lots of
techno was developed on the amiga and then transported to the PC for the
games.  Demo groups (sets of people who got together and produced demo's
for computers, basically showing off their ability to code graphics and
sound for computers half for fun, half for ego, half for job
oportunities) The demo scene was almost all underground originally,
being traded and hoarded by incrowds and mixed with the warez scene but
has surfaced since then now with convo's in silicon valley and arizona
yearly.  Good parties/raves have a few demo's running or if they are
really good have a demo group coding on the fly (such as at L.S.D. (Lets
Start Dancing) in philly a few years back)


> 2. What is it about techno that you like so much? (Whats your favorite
> aspect of the music, what really grabs you?)

My quote above states it all but its the whole concept of being computer
created, synthesized. It just grabs me, i dunno. :)  Ive loved computers
all my life and the first time i heard techno I knew it was created on
the computer before anyone told me.  Its the perfect acompanyment to a
long haul in front of the terminal writing a 30000 line project for some
crappy employer you dont wanna be working for in the first place, you've
been awake for three days with no end in sight and all you have time to
think about is the computer. Chuging jolt, eating chinese, slinging
code, it blends in, puts your mind to the 'rythm of the machine', syncs

you, makes you a co-dependent.

(you know you've coding too long when you start typing in beat with the
music :)


> 3. Describe one of your most memorable Techno experiences (spinning,
> dancing, producing, whatever). 
Ooooh, dancing!  Drop a double hit of LSD or similar and let loose.  The
music takes control and I become the music. This seems to only work for
me and real techno, i can force it out of house or jungle even hip hop. 
But get some really techno either on cd or at a rave and lord ill loose
thirty pounds in sweat alone.  And ache for the next three days. :)


> 4. Who are some of the hottest Techno DJs right now (U.S. and other
> countries), in your opinion. Some labels/records (old & new) for newbies
> to check out. 
Hmm, lord, I have so much variety I really dont know.  Dynamix II is a
fav of mine though they border on industrial sometimes.  For the newbie
I highly suggest going to any reasonable used cd store and listening to
some of their compilations under the Techno listing.  If the cd store
doesnt have a techno listing, then the cd store has no idea what they
are talking about when it comes to techno! Though be forwarned that many
people that I know of define techno as anything thats produced with
digital sounds and samples so all rythm & base, house, etc would fall
under techno too.  Ahh just thought of some others Dj Shadow is a good
one to try.  Psychosonic (old skool techno). 808state 


> 5. Give a short description of yourself, your name, how you are involved

> favorite, etc.
Erm cybergeek of the utmost digree. :) Shit I have computer components
as part of my daily outfits some clasify me as a cyberpunk by the
literary definition. Erm, 21yrold college student at Carnegie Mellon
university. (Think of stereotyped unix guru of yester year and clean him
up a little bit :) I'm planning implants but dont have the gumption for
body modification yet.

Name: David Schwanke.

How am I involved? Well mainly as a listener. I knew a few demo coders
on BBSes a few years back but lost touch with most of them.  I miss it
at raves, jungle is nice, though that just might be pittsburgh dicking
me over.. West coast raves of yesteryear used to feature a highly
technical crowd between the ages of 16 and 30, business types would
escape to them to feel at home with their crowd so they had a reason to
get up and go to work on monday. This is from stories of friends though.
Im originally from new jersey and the parties there/ny/maine usually
have several techno djs on the list.

Most good hacker/computer convo's have good techno spinning when people
are just chilling and chatting, though ive never seen one with a dj but
it would mak sense if it happened.  I go to raves now pay 15 20$ if even
just a single dj is listed under techno.  Its a sacrifice thats worth it
to me.  

REALLY GOOD techno is dj'd directly from synthesizers and not from vynal
(sp). Thats they way it was meant to be, these guys would cringe at the
concept of music produced from an analog source.


Is there a place I can pickup a copy reliably in pittsburgh or order or
web or somethin? Id be really interested in this article. I thought
public techno loving (raves etc) had died or something, been cutoff from
it for so long its starting to hurt.

Geoff pretty much summed up my opinions on SCJ, but here are a few
additionaly comments:

Saint: Sweet selection, but to me more for the headphones than the dance
floor.  Tight mixing.

Alaska: Some good selection ranging from straight jump-up to the more
some shit with big acid bass lines and stripped down drums.  On the other
hand his mixing was pretty shifty: using his fingers to keep the record
on beat, and a not so great mix of an extremely mixable track: Don't
believe.  He kept the energy up though and topped it off with a wicked
breakbeat track bringing back the
old-school-spastic-sample-the-hell-out-of-a-breakbeat-kind-of-feel back. 
Good overall.

Special  K and Skibadee: Hell yeah!  UK MCs are the way to go definitely.
 The energy that the MC brought increased the vibe 100%.  A couple of
power failures at the begining of the set, but everything ran smoothly
afterwards.  Special K's selection was right on, but as geoff said, the
crowd got bored of it after a while (I personally didn't).  Does anybody
know what was up with the uncalled for rewind?  A phenomonal performance
all around.  On the other hand why did he drop brown paper bag (not that
it isn't a great song)?  That was being spun in England almost a year ago
. . . does he think we haven't heard it yet :)  You'd think he would play
the grooverider remix or something.  There isn't any point going any
further in depth, because you just had to be there.

Sine: Definitely bringin' the flavor.  This half hour segment rounded the
evening out very nicely.  Not too crazy, but chilled out and mixed with
Sine style as well.  Respect.

There seemed to be a good bit of people, but there was still enough room
that it wasn't congested on the dance floor.  I hope things like this can
happen again although I don't know if the turnout will make that
possible.  

Did anybody else notice that Special K looked kind of out of it?  I
caught him just staring out into the crowd several times, and he didn't
seem to be looking at anything in particular.  I don't think I saw him
smile the entire night.  I shook his hand afterwards and he just kind of
slowly put his cigarette in his mouth and shook my hand without any sort
of facial expression.  Oh well, he spun a sweet set.

Big up all the SCJ crew for making this possible, I know it couldn't ahve
been easy.

totally agreed...nonstop flow.....skibadee was spectacular..

ehhh...hm.  speciak k started off rockin, but then after warhead, he 
slacked off...i think it had to do with the seemingly endless tunes that 
were too similar to warhead....they really lacked energy and 
booty-shakin goodness....after about half of the set, his selection just 
got really uninspired./...


 Does anybody
>know what was up with the uncalled for rewind?  A phenomonal 
performance
>all around. 

i think sine might have asked for the go-again...not sure tho...
i dont think phenomenal, but it was definitely nice:)


 On the other hand why did he drop brown paper bag (not that
>it isn't a great song)?  That was being spun in England almost a year

>. . . does he think we haven't heard it yet :)  You'd think he would

brown paper bag still gets me movin even though i must have heard it a 
million times since like last september, when i can first recall hearin 
it....it always makes me happy, but his mix into it was kinda dodgy, the 
only poor mix i heard all night from him...


>Sine: Definitely bringin' the flavor.  This half hour segment rounded 
the

couldnt stay, i was tired as nuts....im sure it rocked in typical sine 
stylez tho:)

i really thought there would be more people there...,,..this doent look 
promising for the scj crew to take chances and bring in more overseas 
talent, but i dont know for sure what the turnout was like.....

i saw him smokin a spliff whilst he wuz mixin, so that may have been 
part of it.....he really didnt look like he was enjoyin himself....

definitely, these guys always put on somethin worth goin to and i think 
more people should be there...i mean, work or skool may be a problem, 
but only once every two weeks??? thats not much of a sacrifice to 
support the scene.....i hope they continue to rock...i cant remember a 
disappoining scj (other than jeffee) in a LONG time....
anyway...shouts to absolut, hossam (toronto dis weekend!!!!), that punk 
ass cutup, and all my boys....

Story time.
Picture a man on journey beyond site and sound. Oh wait sorry, wrong channel.
Picture a man sitting in a corner watching the show. Totaly consumed with his
favorite chemical attempting to determine why he is not having fun.  Its not
the drugs, he was having plenty of fun before he came (and subsequently after).
Of course his mind is wandering from thought to thought, while he chokes on
the synthsmoke that was a touch too thick at times. Then he listens closer to
the music, and watches the crowd.  Tries to see what they get out of it, they
look like they are having fun so of course he wishes too as well.  Then he
realizes it, the moment of truth, he does not like Jungle! Its not the DJs its
not the lights, its the music! Well, wait now, this is supposed to be a damn
good dj. He recognize the sounds, samples, the lyrical style is amazing
so whats not grabbing him, whats actually hurting him? Its the rythem!
Or lack there of actually.  There is litterally no rythm to the vibes. 
Not that this is bad thing, but he realizes that he simply must have
rythm.  

Which is a bummer too cuz we dont have techno night anymore.  Anyone know what
laga does on the other tuesday nights that SCJ isnt up? Maybe stick a techno
side in there.  I was impressed by the rastamarian lyricing I havnt heard that
stuff in a very long time.  

I can picture how people could enjoy it, I just cant, so, does anyone have any
suggestions on other clubs in pittsburgh that DONT play jungle?

	Ok, I was about to write back and say, well, jungle's not for 
everyone, that is, until you threw that little jibe in.  Just because the
rhythm (notice the extra "h") is too complex for you to realize the 3/4 or
4/4 time signature, does not mean there is no rhythm.  Western song, with
perhaps the exception of Native American folk, can exist without a semi-
concrete beat, whether it be 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4 (Jazz classic "Take
Five"), 6/8, 9/8, etc.  There are many more simple and complex signatures.
Even though some of them sound alike, their characters are different.  For
example 6/8 can sound similar to 3/4 to the untrained ear.
	The difference between house, techno, trance, gabber (as blanket
subjects) and jungle, reggae, and other branches are the rhythms between
the first downbeat of each measure.  You might notice that in house, for
example, there is a steady < 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + > rhythm.  While in jungle,
there is that same steady beat, including corresponding downbeats and
upbeats in equal number (usually; 7/8 is a beast).  There are combinations
of rhythms within the signature's frame that utilize the downbeats as a
tool, too.  While house often limits its rhythms to half, quarter, and
eighth beats and rests, jungle is almost entirely made up of quarter,
eighth, sixteenth, thirty-second, and sixty-fourth beats and rests.
Jungle is usually very staccato, as well.  
	Perhaps you do have a sense of rhythm, but maybe it's just not in
tune to the extent that you're able to recognize a strong down beat if
it's not pointed out to you exclusively.  Nope, jungle's not for everyone.
But we don't need no false statements here.  Have you seen the picture
of a man dressed in a suit with his head up his ass?  It's quite amusing.

Bleah, I guess I'm the only one who didn't like the MC... Guess I like the
music too much and consider it distracting? I dunno... but then again I
didnt really like Special-K as much as I thought I would... I enjoyed
Alaska's set more, and really wanted to get up and Dance when he was on...
(I'm on Muscle relaxants for neck pain tho and they seem to have the
opposite effect of vitamin e ): ) I guess I care alot more about what's
being played rather than how it's mixed... Mebby a love for Mixing talent
will come with time? (I remember my first beer, I thought it tasted like
crap, but now...)
I'm still new to the Rave scene, though I've been listening to Techno since
Kraftwerk released that CD with that "boing boom chak" song on it... and
More Rave style since I got my Atari 800xl and C=64 (btw whoever said that
techno started with the Amiga, heh, there was a whole world of it in the
Atari and C=64 community before the Amiga was a wet Dream)

At any rate, lets all hook up and say Hi at the G-Spot? anyone wanna plan
somthin like mebby meet near the Bathroom round midnight or some shit?

Dan

p.s. I hope the person who said the location had changed is right :) I dont
have a hell of alot of fun when yer shoulder to shoulder.

Jenifer Foulmood.......the worlds infamous tall,long black haired (now short
haired), opera singer explains it all;-)   Nothing like speaking your
mind!!!!!!!!  It's nice to know that someone does it.  Jungle gets a bad wrap
sometimes for being "off beat" well....I've been producing ambient music for
over 4 years now....And when I occassionally venture into the realms of
jungle....IT'S HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!     Anyone can rip off a beat and add some
effects to it.  But try sitting down one day and making an actual jungle
beat....better yet....try making a few of them so when you paste them all
together they actually sound good!!!!!!!!!!!    I'm not saying that jungle is
the only from of music out there.....but when people talk about how bad music
is due to the way that it's produced...well........I just hope that you've
done some producing in the past.

Alright, I may have made a mistake in my phrasing then.  The rhythm may
be there, (I can hear it on occasion) but the excessiveness of the base
distorts, the feedback or echo or vibrations of one beat is not done
before the next one begins. This isnt a problem for high notes but for
low notes it drowns out the rhythm. Maybe its my ears, I dunno, except
that most of the base beats sound grindy and distorted and out of line
with each other.  I would still say that the end result has no rhythm.
It may have been designed and played with rhythm but whats coming out of
the speakers does not have the rhythm that went into it.  
My brother is a drummer, and though I may not have the technical
expertise for all the jargon I do know what rhythm is from what he has
taught me and can catch some pretty complex shit but its just not there
in most jungle that I have heard.  Are you taking into a account the
random overlays? 

I'll put it another more down to earth way. We all know the whistlers (I
am one) the guys who screach a whistle from time to time.  Next time you
hit a rave listen to the number of times that the whistlers can keep a
steady beat on other forms of techno vses jungle.  Whistlers get out
one, maybe two and then splat there is no where else to go.  I'll follow
a jungle rhythm and be like, DOE the dj fucked up again.  It was just
that SCJ was when I realized, wait they cant be fucking up THAT much its
GOTTA be on purpose.

Err, what is a downbeat? 

I guess in all I was using the wrong phrasing, there was no discernable
rhythm comeing out of the speakers last night at laga. :)  I mean watch
the people who dance, whach the people who do the lights (though at
raves, dont even bother with watching laga's) I have yet to see someone
who COULD keep in time with jungle.  So even if there is rhythm, no one
else can dance to it either. :)

I do enjoy listening to it most of the time unless im having a bad day,
but its not dancing music in my opinion. Its more like moshing music.
And I dont think others would look too kindly on me moshing too it. :)

Well, still depends on how to define techno. :) I dont remember anyone
releaseing tracks from atari and c64 games but they were released and
ripped from amiga and pc games all the time. But feel free to correct me
:) I really would not count the Atari because of the cartridge
basedness, jrandom person cannot try and fail at making his own. C64 on
the other hand there is a chance but I never heard any.

Mr Schwanke,
first of all why are you mr techo/rave authority all of a sudden.  Last
year you were mr punk rocker, now your mr raver.  You are an awakward
looking kid who's really obnoxious.  (he wears padlocks and computer
chips).  
    First you talk about dancing, which you know nothing about.  Now
your dissing jungle for not having rhythm!  Jungle has mad rhythm.  It's
not four on the floor but a good jungle track has allot of groove!  
    Please stop posting these nonsense messages schwanke.  
    I suggest everyone else on the list stop replying to him.  I think
he gets off on creating these little arguments.  
    He's giving my school and it's ravers/djs a bad name.  Most people
on the pb-cle list probably think cmu is full of obnoxious
ravers/clubbers.

pissed off,
Johnny

there were lots of c64 tekkno style musak....   the hackers more often
than not had some sort of tekkno in their intros & demos, and many of the
games did as well, they just werent in a standard format like the midi or
mod .... so they werent usually seen in the context of a song only, they
were with something else.  lots of good stuff there, i used to make tapes
of the stuff to listen to.  still have some buried somewhere =)

hey!!! whats wrong with bein a punk??? i still go to punk shows, wear 
punk t-shirts/pins/patches/whatever, im still involved with certain 
organisations like Food Not Bombs that are run by punks.....theres no 
reason to diss someone becuz of that...actually, i wish there was some 
of the activism and social awareness in the rave scene that is in the 
punk scene.....i mean, i certainly dont see what he was talkin about (im 
a beginning jungle dj, and it definitely does have rhythm) but dont 
degrade someone cause theyre not 100% pure rave kid....

I've been reading this list for a long time, it gives me something 
entertaining to do at work, and I've never felt the need to post...until 
now. First off, I hope that this Johnny guy was kidding and only being 
sarcastic, but somehow I doubt it.

Since when has the 'rave scene' been about what you wear? Oh wait, it's been 
about clothes for years. SO what you're saying, Johnny, is that because he 
wears chains and computer chips, and not what...Nautica gear???, he doesn't 
belong? Because he used to, and admits to still being, a punk he doesn't 
belong? Oh yeah, the 'rave scene' isn't about music and dancing, it's about 
fitting in and being considered cool.

So Tom made a comment that voiced his opinion on Jungle, one I didn't agree 
with but that's not the point, and you feel the need to cut him down for 
what he looks like? God forbid you try and explain to him why you think he 
is wrong, just tell people he's funny looking, that'll shut him up.

I can not believe that this is what the 'rave scene' has turned in to. You 
want to 'dis punks? Go right ahead, but the punk scene is really a scene, 
one the 'rave scene' should envy and try to emulate. Go on down to Food Not 
Bombs one day and you'll see kids, who all look different by the way, using 
their common love of music etc. to do some good, for a cause. And guess 
what, they act like adults. I am sick of going to parties only to be 
surrounded by either A) 13 year olds trying to act hard, what ever that is, 
or B) 20 year olds dressing and acting like 13 year olds (with their little 
kid back packs and whatever else a little kid would have).

Now before everyone gets pissed off, I know there are, and god I wish there 
were more, people going to parties for the music and dancing rather than a 
fashion show and drug feast. In fact, it's gotten to the point where it is a 
major issue if I'm gonna go to a party because I know I'll be in the 
minority. And I know what the answer I am going to get is: "So don't go and 
shut up." But you know what, unlike the people who will give this reply, I 
go for the music. If there's a DJ I really want to see, or someone doing a 
live pa I really wanna hear, I'm gonna brave the kindergarten massive and 
check it out. But I have the right to complain.

So to the people who are there for the music and dancing, you rock. Keep it 
up.

SO Johnny, grow up and learn to accept. And hey, educate rather than bad 
mouth, it's a waste of breath, or in this case a waste of typing. And 
honestly, it just makes you look like an asshole.

Lisa

I'm going to reply to both in one message.  Bandwidth and all that.

That's part of the rhythm of jungle.  A load of manic sounding beats
finally collapsing into a single blast of bass.  Then the process starts
all over again.

Sounds to me like you need to listen to a bit more jungle outside of
clubs.  It's a hard style to get used to.

It very well might be your ears.

Ummm...  ok.  Maybe cooking down samples to be grainy sounding and
mechanical is a waste of time.

<erases a hardrive's worth of samples>

And now to the reply to the abouve..

> looking kid who's really obnoxious.  (he wears padlocks and computer

Ummm... <cough cough>

<points to the 386 proc and sixteen pin IC sockets behind his right ear>

Let's not harsh the boy for wearing hardware just yet, ok?  <smile>

He just needs to listen to more tracks outside of clubs.  Jungle, I will
admit, is not easy to get used to.

Though his arguments about dancing (or the lack of ability therof) were so
half-assed (nay, even smaller fractions of posterior) they were more
laughable than anything.

Not really.  If that can be said about CMU, then CMU is populated by my
kind of people! <g>

Seriously, he's just proving an age-old tagline:  Open mouth, insert foot,
echo internationally.  He'll get around to becoming a worthwhile poster or
wind up in everyone's killfiles in the next week or so.

This guy from the Roots can do that too.  They opened for Beck at the
JAR.  They're an awesome hip-hop band.

no he definitely means scratching. check out a video or tapes form any of
the fantazia (uk) raves from 93/94. look for a guy named 'mc scratch n
techno'


def. not beatboxing. imagine bobby mcferrin working with puff daddy, and
well, i dont know if thats an accurate description, but *imagine* bobby mc
ferrin working with puff daddy. woah. that made my head hurt.

ok this is called "getto booty battle" (yes minus the "H"). i know the
promoter rachel she is from pittsburgh. i just talked to her on sunday
night but haven't had time to post until now. she's getting a space right 
now, probably a warehouse, possibly an empty supermarket or something. it
will be held in may. and she had just gotten confirmation that phantom 45
and danny da wildchild are going to tagteam battle with rob + joe from
kent. rob + joe are definitely going to win. i have seen all 4 of those
DJs recently. speaking of which i have to post something about future. 

by the way does anybody have any idea how many people a 50,000 sq ft
warehouse will hold? (is there a people-to-sq-ft-ratio or something?)
there is one here, (virgin-space too!) + we're going to use it someday.
it's a long-term goal.

Damn, you need to take a chill pill!  he wasn't trying to dis him because
he liked punk music, he was dissing him because he is a fucking poser and
decided to convert to techno because it was the "cool thing to do".

(I don't know him personaly , just going off the vibe the other guy gave)

OK, I think you seriously have a problem.  And I'm not saying this trying
to dis you or anything but look.  If you listen to ALMOST any jungle
track there is a bass note on the one, a snare on the two, a base note on
the "and" (half way between three adn four) of three and a snare on the
four.  This is not a very complex rhythm and in reality it is just a rap
beat sped up (I'm making generalization's but bear with me).  And I KNOW
you don't think rap has rhythm and people LOVE to dance to rap.

Maybe it was the drugs you were on?!

First off: That is completely not true.  

Secondly: I'm not trying to say I'm a great dancer, but I definitely can
keep with the beat on most jungle tracks.  And so can MANY MANY other
people.  I saw a whole bunch of people that were dancing to the beat and
pretty well in addition.  

Thirdly: The whole light thing . . . there is no way you can be right
about this due to the fact that many of the lights at laga (and some at
real raves) are sound activated . . . meaning they have little
microphones that tell the lights when to move.  SO unless every light you
have ever seen is broken, OR you have extremely skilled perception and
you can tell the difference between a fraction of a second (the time it
takes the sound to get up to microphone), you are just a little confused.

>I do enjoy listening to it most of the time unless im having a bad day,
>but its not dancing music in my opinion. Its more like moshing music.

I'm completely confused on your opinion about this whole thing.  Many of
the jungle beats nowadays are no more complex than rock beats.  As a
matter of fact many jungle tracks these days solely use looped, sometimes
sped up, drum beat samples.

Whatever man,

ABSOLUT

Woah...that's a good idea...I'd love to hear someone beatbox to some happy
hardcore, although I imagine it would take some skill.  I'v heard of a few
people who beatbox "jungle" or whatever you might call it, but none live.
I do consider myself a (very) amateur beatboxer, but I don't know if i'd
dare to flex with all the elements in hc or jungle.

Oh yeah, my point - that guy DID make scratchin' sounds with his mouth,
which i guess is a kind of beatboxin, but it really sounded like
scratchin' not beats.  His name was MC Storm.  An ok MC, but not really
any better than 187, who pretty much wings it.

    I was in no way dissing the punk scene or saying the rave scene was
totally superficial.  The rave scene may be a tad bit more superficial
than the punk scene, but not much.  I like punk and still go to punk and
idie rock shows back home.   In fact last summer I went to more of these
than I did dance clubs or raves.  But don't tell me that the punk scene
is all nice and trying to help all the time.  food not bombs is great,
my roomate last year used to go allot (she's punk rock)!  However, if a
normal looking mildly preppy kid went to a punk show he'd definitly get
looks!  Maybee even treated bad.  This goes for most scenes.
    SO BEFORE YOU JUMP ON MY ASS THINK BEFORE YOU WRITE!  
    You obviously missed the point of my message.  It was not about how
ravers should wear baggy pants and nautica jackets.  I have been keeping
quiet about this guy since the dance wars a few weeks ago.  I just had
to say something after his SCJ post.

wurd,
Johnny

That's great that you don't think people should judge punks based on 
what they wear but maybe you should apply that same logic to your 
judgement of ravers.

Hmmm...I kind of remember a certain someone dissin' on 'ravers' a few
years back. ;)  Not that people don't get wiser.  And the fact that some
ravers (and punks, and well, anyone who's ill) need to get dissed on.

I do wish the rave scene (hell - people in general!) had more activism &
social awareness...but I don't see it happening except in small
increments...the same increments that the people who are into it would
make if they weren't in the rave scene. (Is is punk scene REALLY any
different. Maybe a little, but very little.)

 Peace, Love, Unity, Respect is all good, but can't we harness it for
something more?  Prob not since most folks can't handle their own petty
problems, little-alone the world's. I'm all for anarcho-collectivism,
anti-control propaghandist, free thought, free spirits and making people's
lives better little bits at a time, but I don't think i could ever get
into a political/social movement based on the rave scene as it is now.  No
thanks.

Anyway, sorry for the rant folks, just some thoughts.

>did ANYONE out there say carrot?

I did.  But I think we have to be careful with thinking like this:
    
> ... I have found that [the word "arrow" in the exercise] makes the 
>human think of the vegetable "cARROt".

I think I've heard this carrot thing before except I think I've heard 
that it doesn't matter what you do as long as you clear someone's mind 
before asking them what vegetable they think of. (i.e. the number 6 and 
the wording of it has nothing to do with it.) I think I heard that it's 
just due to the fact that in America and maybe in Western culture in 
general the carrot is the most frequently used archetype, or reference 
image, for thinking about more abstract word "vegetable". (A carrot is 
an easy thing to understand.  It's BASICALLY one thing.  A vegetable can 
take on many different forms.  It's impossible to think of all those 
forms at once so we have use the archetypes I'm talking about.)  
However, I seriously doubt that 98% statistic.  How many African 
tribesman who don't know what a carrot is would answer "carrot"?  Maybe 
they're "the other 2%" but I don't think so.

                                                   Aaron

p.s. (Michael: Just so I don't contradict myself on the topic of 
aesthetic cultural conditioning, let me say that the aesthetic judgement 
process I referred to in talking to you doesn't necessarily include a 
time element.  It's not talking about what you might first think of when 
confronted with something.)

I seem to recall someone calling someone else a poser.  Aren't we all just
posers, some of us for a really long time?

Besides if you want to talk about posers, let's talk about Manny.  I think
we all know who I'm talking about.  All bandwagons leaving in five
minutes.  Boarding calls for bandwagons leaving in five minutes.  He may
have supported punk for a long time, but I really think he's just looking
for a sub-culture he can be bitter from within.

Too each his own, i mean not to be obnoxios tell me what I do that is
obnoxios and I will decide if its worth changing.  Oh, btw, I have NEVER
been a punk rocker. :) I in no way intended to be an authority, merely
voicing my opinion and asking others what they think. Ive gotten some
personal replies on both sides of the fence so I know I am not alone in
this but im certainly not going with the flow either.  As for all of a
sudden, ive been actively raving for 3+ years with on and off for a few
years before that.  But even that does not make me an athority.  I
merely know what I like. 

>     First you talk about dancing, which you know nothing about.  Now
> your dissing jungle for not having rhythm!  Jungle has mad rhythm.  It's
> not four on the floor but a good jungle track has allot of groove!  
I believe I corrected my mistake in a reply, if I did not then I'll
state it publicly again.  Jungle has rythm but the hyped up bass beats
distort it. It could be my ears, it could be other things, but I cannot
hear the rhythm.  As for the dancing, again I beleive I clarified that
at SCJ I realized that I was interpreting the danc/music the wrong way
and that it was me and not the music. Did I not make that clear enough?
I said that I finally realized I did not like jungle, NOT that jungle
was bad music.  Its damn good music, just not for me. In so many words I
was apologizing for my last bitch about SCJ.

>     I suggest everyone else on the list stop replying to him.  I think
> he gets off on creating these little arguments.  
I dont try to create arguments, just discussions.  I'll admit my
language gets a bit harsh at times but I try to keep it in line when
possible.  I also try to enumerate as much as possible that this is my
opinion and always my opinion which I am entitled to. At any point in
time that people dont want to clutter the list with responses to my
posts for fear of starting a war or something by all means email me
personally. I dont get into bitch matches/flame wars, they are highly
unproductive. (Though I do talk out of my ass from time to time, its the
drugs man, im tellin ya)

I doubt that, but if I have someone how caused this to be true then I
apologize, I would hope and pray that no one thinks that I represent the
entire cmu comunity.

Todd M Keebler@juno.com 

Ok. Something I'm doing is not working here, so I'm gunna shut up for a bit and
see if I can figure out what the fuck I did wrong. Let me get some things 
straight.

I did not want to start a war.
I certainly didnt wanna piss anybody off.
I wanted to know what others felt.
I tried to express my interpretation, obviosly some people didnt like it.
I guess most of the list has a different way of interpreting my writing then
most other places I have posted. I have never gotten such a hard response b4
in my life.  I have never been called obnoxios.
I did not 'convert' to raving/techno. Ive been in love with techno since I 
was a child and got my hands on my first xt  w/modem. And been raving heavy 
since sophmore year of college (not sooner due to lack of transportation in
bumblefuck nj). Classes cut into it last year but this year I promised myself
to go to as many as possible if I have to borrow/beg/or buy a ride.
I enjoy *ALL* forms of music but my favorites are techno/house/hiphop/Megadeth.
I have never been a punk. Though I do like the music on occasion.
Maybe I'm turning into a bitter old man, ive been suspecting it for
quite a time.

I *will* admit that I dont like the way the scene is going here in pgh but it
is only natural that if someone does not like the way something is they wish
to change it. I did not mean to sound like I wanted to strong hand it
into conforming to my idea of the ideal rave.. 

I am honest, a little too honest at times and it gets me in trouble (such as 
this, obviosly).

Personally I think that if a discussion was purely "I love this stuff,
yeah me too" it would be pretty boring.  But if you all wanna mail bomb
me and tell me to shut up and stop saying what I do and dont like then I
will. Though I'll tell you I am gunna lay off a little more on when I
express my negative feelings since they seem to piss so many people off.

I am not a poser.
Though I do have a big ego on occasion and welcome people to point out
when, ive been trying to disband it for a few years now, it has dwindled
but not below the level that I find exceptable, yet.

If you got to know me you would know that I am excessivly caring for people,
a a strong proponent of free speech and public opinion, fairly open to
ideas and one fucked up kid all around.

I am glad that more people have technologymods on their bodies, you rock.

SOOOOOO, I am PUBLICLY APOLIGIZING FOR HOW BAD MY WRITINGS HAVE GONE OVER ON
THE LIST!

I would thouroughly enjoy private input into your feelings on this:
(both good and bad)
My email is schwanke@cmu.edu
My icq is 6577150
and I am DaCourie on irc (efnet).

Bitch me out, compliment me, whatever.

WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT?!  YOU CAN'T GET A PHYSICAL PUNCH IN SO YOU
USE THIS FORUM?  It doesn't matter what he looks like.  I'm a six foot
tall GIRL which makes me pretty awkward myself.  Perhaps you should
publicly ridicule me, too.  While you're at it maybe you should poke fun
of the way I dress, I don't wear nautica or polo or hilfiger.  It doesn't
matter if he just found raving a year ago.  Guess what, I just found it
two years ago, which means a year ago, I found it one year ago.  Was I a
poser last year?  Before I was a raver I was full on alterna-chic?  What
does that make me?  Have you been raving since the womb?  Were you born in
phat pants and adidas on you feet?  

WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT HE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT
DANCING.  I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU IN ACTION; FOR ALL I KNOW YOU PROBABLY
SUCK!!!	  

This post characterizes for me a personal dig.  I have lost any and all
respect I ever might have had for you.  If there are any posts I
aggressively decide not to answer, they will be yours.  I know a
hell of a lot of CMU graduates so I know that they're not all
self-indulging sub-culture snobs that you seem to think you're not.  

I wish we wore little raver badges so I could rip it off of your breast
and throw it into the dirt, forever disgracing you in the eyes of your
peers.

Hey,

I read you post about that Schwanke guy, and I have to think you have some
vandetta against this poor, misguided little boy.  I also thought your
post was cute!

HEY!!!! i was like 13 years old.....all i had really heard was house, 
which im still not a big fan of.....;)

  Not that people don't get wiser.  And the fact that some

>I do wish the rave scene (hell - people in general!) had more activism

>different. Maybe a little, but very little.)

id at least say that there is a lot more willingness to participate... 
heres what ill do, ill bring some flyers about food not bombs (which is 
always in need of assistance) to terminal velocity and scj and whatnot, 
and ill see how many people respond to it....theres just not the same 
priorities in the scenes...not that either one is superior, quite the 
contrary actually...thats why i try to be an active member of both.....

>

thats a problem......the mass's problems are yours too, and in alot of 
cases more important thatn whatever is on your mind at the time...it has 
alot to do with your level of selflessness.....i try to involve myself 
as much as possible.....not that im perfect or anything...its just one 
of the gripes i have with the rave scene as a whole....


 I'm all for anarcho-collectivism,

people's
>lives better little bits at a time, but I don't think i could ever get

No
>thanks.


really......i think that just about says it all....a good attitude 
doesnt change things by itslef.....people need to get educated and 
involved...

peace, 
toM

this is the best idea ive heard in a long time.....i think all mailing 
list subscribers should wear little badges saying how cool we are 
because we're ravers....that way in case no one could tell, they wouldnt 
think we're poseurs.....;)

on the this subject....

most ravers dont have rythym or soul. when i say this i am not just talking
about how they dance but also theyre selection in tunes as well.

about who goes and is cool or not i can only say i go out for the music, i
could care less to meet some of the geeks i see at these events hidden in all
of theyre jaked ass tommy,nautica,fubu and jinko shit......get some taste 

while on the subject of people at parties, i have met many people at events
and i can say about only 15% of them are are people i would ever pursue a out
of party relationship with. from my experiences with people in the scene is
that most are out for drugs. it's a shame cause this is the only new music to
have been created in this century and not enough people are REALLY into it.


please awaken now!

Hmm, since this has become bitchfest 98' and I'm bored I think I'll jump
into it.  First of all let me say that I respect you all and if you don't
agree with my opinion, that is cool.

That said, I am pretty damn tired of people complaining that others are
not going to raves for the "right" reasons.  It is either because they
wear trendy clothes, do drugs or something that makes you think that raves
are just a shallow diversion for people.  Whatever!!!  I don't really give
a fuck why you want to come to a rave, I'm just happy to be dancing
besides other happy people.  If you want to wear tommy whatnot or do lines
of draino, I'm not going to throw a hissy fit (though excessive drug use
does worry me).  I feel something special at raves and I assume everyone
else is getting something special out of it too.  If not, well..it is your
loss.  I just hope none of this ng bitching causes any would-be ravers to
shy away from posting and attending parties.  I for one will welcome ya
with open arms no matter what punk-ass scene your from (I was into
pop/alternative not too long ago).

Also, I think jungle has plenty of booty-shakin' rythem but I do
understand that it is hard to appreciate at first.  I'm still not over my
initial distaste for the stattaco and seemingly random beats of jungle.
However, occasionaly I will stop and think to myself: "damn, this track is
pretty fly!".  I think it is just technicaly much different than any other
form of electronic music and takes some time to get used to.

pEace,
jP

Hey I totally agree that ravers have gone to search for the eternal buzz. As an
example, I will replay what I heard about our last event in Cleveland, Kinetic,
which made me very disappointed. Of course you folks knew that there were two
parties on JAN 17TH. Our turnout was alright due to the circumstances. But the
crowd started to thin out around 2-3, in the middle of David Hollands set. By
the way, this man was slammin' for 3 straight hours, and at no point was there
any reason to leave. But from the feeback that I had recieved from friends and
fellow patrons, was that people had decided to leave because of the lack of
drugs there. 

I personally felt that the lack of drugs was a GOOD thing, with me
being the proprieitor of the party and not wanting to have to deal with someone
feeling that they are superman, or woman, and taking mad amounts of something
that they know nothing about. But others seem to feel that their "rave"
experience just wasn't complete without the daily dosage of hard drugs.<-not
daily, but I just thought it sounded better, but I could be right. Anyway, to
make a "long story short" <- I should be shot for using that, people left
because they didn't have drugs and couldn't find any. Hey, I apologize for
bringing you great dj's, a killer venue, and a total zen atmosphere, but I
guess I should have just passed out free caps at the door. 

Let me be clear in saying that I have nothing against people using or wanting
to use drugs, it's a free country and people should be able to do it legally.
But at least TRY and enjoy everything the scene has to offer besides the drugs.
Face reality once in your life without having to face it hyped up on something.
The first two raves I ever went to I got fucked up and had a decent time, I
wouldn't have went back if I didn't. But the next time I went, I went totally
sober and had a fucking blast. And ever since, I never do anything when I go.
I sure improved the way I dance, i don't have that stumbling, trying to keep my
equilibrium in check, style of dancing at least. 

But anyway again, thanks to everyone who stuck around and kept the vibe going
and mostly, supported the people who gave us the music. What would the scene be
like without the music, can we say "non-existent?" The dj's were still very
pleased with the kids that stuck it out until the end. Hollands and the others
said that they thought our scene in Cleveland had potential, but it was up to
us, ravers that is, to keep it up and kickin' the way it should. <-I feel like
a preacher, all I need is someone to say, "preach on brother!" 

well that is all I got to say 'bout that...
peace out-

Someone posted earlier about people going to Raves for drugs... I've heard
this several times, and I just dont get it.. Maybe I live in the wrong
neighborhood, but if I wanted drugs I could just go down to the street
corner and buy some, and save the drive and the $20 admission fee. I go to
raves and do prostigidous amounts of drugs yes, but I don't go for the drugs
themselves, cause as much as I like the music, a) I cant stay away till 6am
normally, and b) I get bored if I'm straight after about 4 hours, and c)
It's just way more awesome to listen to when I'm cruising.

As far as people in the Rave scene getting more "involved"... heh, what's
wrong with people loving the music, going to listen to it, and going home?
bleah I try to keep politics and charity in thier own places. If I want to
do good, I'll go to the red-cross and volunteer, or donate cash etc... I
don't need my buddies to help me or to look good in front of... Why not let
the scene be about what it's about, music, and dancing... I guess some
people feel the need to belong to a family? or to substitute for a family
that doesnt understand them? I can relate to that, my family doesnt'
understand me in the least :)

And as far as posers, yeah I guess any scene you will get your posers... I
guess being completely out of the bracket of people who "normally" go to
raves, I am succeptable to criticism myself, "he's there for drugs" "he's
there for the young girls" as well as the regular poser comments etc... (not
that anyone's said anything like that) bleah so I guess I'm a little
over-conscious about all of these things, and tend to stand/sit/dance by
myself alot at these things, although I'm not sure if that helps or hurts?
:)

Okay it's late.

What's the word with net-meet? Bathrooms at 12 or right side speaker stand
at 2? (is there only one room? there's ALOT of people on the line-up for one
room)

I think I can give a ride from PGH to the G-Spot for one person if anyone's
interested. I dont' know cleveland very well (but I can read a map:)) so be
forewarned. It might be nice to have someone to follow there, any takers?

Yeah that's the Idea I got too... bleargh. And whoever said something about
the 20 year olds trying to front like they're 13 year olds at raves, heh,
that was lame. I'm not really gonna go down that road cause You seem just as
bad of a poser for thinking that no-one over the age of 20 actually goes for
the music.

Herm I cant say that about Raves, I'm kinda normal/preppy looking (and OLD)
and people seem real nice to me... Overall I havnt ran in with many
posers... but then I've only been to a few Raves.

So explain to me again the concept of poser.  Is there a certain time
frame in which one changes from poser to hardcore?  I mean, if you start
raving, for example, is one a poser for two months, six months, a year?
After said time period, does one become a raver (again, as the example) if
one attends a certain quota of raves?  Is there an initiation?  So if one
has been raving for two years, does that make them an intermediate raver,
with one year qualifying one as a novice?  When does one become an
advanced raver; what qualifies as advanced?  Is it the number of drugs,
parties, fashion sense, dance moves, or all of the above?  Is there a form
one should fill out in order to become a non-poser?  If so, please send to
the above address, c/o pb-cle-raves.

Sincerely,

Hehe :)

I always thought of a poser as someone who's trying to be someone else in
order to look cool, or gain popularity, or whatever. I guess you could be a
veteran 10 year raver and be more of a poser than someone at thier first
rave IMHO...

i feel similar to jp when he says he is just happy to be dancing besides
other happy people but the problem today (at least in cleveland and at
least with jungle) is that NOBODY DANCES. its all these kids standing
around watching each other looking hard and no one is getting into the
music. it really disturbs me!!  (case in point: sunday at FUTURE, i would
say at the highest point maybe 5% of the crowd was even on the floor). now
i know that some people just dont like to dance, but its starting to look
like one big social hour..i mean are people just not *getting* how to
dance to jungle? is it self-awareness or do they just want to pay
their money to come and hang out with their friends and cop and attitude??
now i know everyone on this list dances ;) , but what i just don't get is
why hasn't jungle caught on here yet???!! it really sucks being the
minority who are truly getting into and participating in the whole jungle
experience, not just standing around looking stupid... alright. that was
my rant for the year.

This is kinda funny cuz it's a direct analogy to what someone was saying
about the club scene being dull without the service of alcohol.  I guess the
same goes for the lack of drugs at raves.

Well, yeah!!  didn't you guys hear about the raver baseball cards?  It has
stats of all ravers, including their drug stats.  Quite the collectable.

	I can't speak for this guy, but I dress the way I do b/c I get the preppy
type clothes for Christmas from relatives and I'm too cheap to buy other
stuff.  I don't think anyone's going to cop a "I got this at the mall"
attitude, but I could be mistaken.

This is the first time I've felt compelled to post to the list, and I'm
sorry this is going to be so negative but that's the way it has to be.

No.  I'm sorry, but NO.  The alleged techno revolution was the result of
some very talented people in Detroit including, among others Juan Atkins,
Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (to drop the standard names)  It is not
possible for the music they and others produced to have been spun off of
early Amiga games.  The first amiga, the Amiga 1000, came out in '85.
Whereas, Juan Atkins' Cybotron started releasing in '82, '83, and the
others had also begun by '85.  Seeing as these are the people who coined
the term "techno" I'm quite sure they win.  Let us for the sake of
argument use a slightly less restrictive definition of techno.  Acid house
still predates the Amiga, and was pretty much what triggered the rave
explosion in the UK.  Though the Amiga is a popular computer among
musicians,  the assertion that demo groups (which I am, btw, familiar with
from my own BBS envolvement 6-7 yrs ago) were even partially responsible
for techno is patently absurd.

In what sense Dj Shadow qualifies as techno, I'm sure I don't know.

> (sp). Thats they way it was meant to be, these guys would cringe at the

These two sentences are possibly more ridiculous than the entire bit of
drivel up above about Amiga and PC games.  First off, I'm not entirely
sure that one can be said to dj from a synthesizer in the first place.
Second of all the most commonly used drum machines, Roland's 808 and 909,
are analogue.  The best loved synths are analogue (303, Jupiter, Prophet
5, many many many more)  In fact, if anything defines that classic techno
sounds, its thick, rich analogue sounds.  Third, most of the original
techno greats are dj's too.  Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson,
and moving on into more modern times, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills, Carl
Lekebush, Adam Beyer.  Admired just as much as dj's as producers. 

I'm not one for strictly pigeon-holing music, but if we're going to use
the name techno as if it meant something, we shouldn't be flinging it
about into places it doesn't belong with wild abandon.  I'm not the
authoritative source of all techno knowledge, but I know what I know, eh?

That's my 2 mother-fucking cents,
-Tom.

I'm sorry, I don't know a lot about techno and it's production as far as
the history is concerned, yet.  I have heard a group called Kraftwerk and
weren't they playing, technically speaking, technological music as early
as the 70's?  I thought they actually made their own synthesizing
instruments on which to produce such sounds that were new to the world.
I don't know, maybe I'm just talking out of my ass, as we're all so
talented at doing.

[Kira]   I agree.  For most people at raves these days the issue has become 
either a drug fest or a fashion show.  That's why the best DJ's in Pgh. are 
so underrated.  The majority at parties around here have no clue.  They 
don't understand that a DJ playing good records is not necessarily a good 
DJ.  People don't recognize or appreciate the skills it takes to be a great 
DJ who's an entertainer.
At our parties we only book the best of the best and we try to control the 
drugs as best we can.  It's one thing to come and take good E and get off 
dancing to great DJ's till dawn.  It's another to come to score some K and 
smoke bowl after bowl in a corner all night.  This is what we're trying to 
avoid by having strict security at the door, and if you don't like it 
obviously you're trying to do something that we don't want at our events 
anyway.  We'd rather have 300 people come in and appreciate and respect 
what we're doing and have a good time than 800 fiends who just want to get 
fucked up.
Kira
Sessions


on this subject....

most ravers dont have rythym or soul. when i say this i am not just talking
about how they dance but also theyre selection in tunes as well.

about who goes and is cool or not i can only say i go out for the music, i
could care less to meet some of the geeks i see at these events hidden in 
all
of theyre jaked ass tommy,nautica,fubu and jinko shit......get some taste

while on the subject of people at parties, i have met many people at events
and i can say about only 15% of them are are people i would ever pursue a 
out
of party relationship with. from my experiences with people in the scene is
that most are out for drugs. it's a shame cause this is the only new music 
to
have been created in this century and not enough people are REALLY into it.


please awaken now!

[Kira Huntzinger]  Word up.  I've been dealing with Manny Theiner since I 
was a DJ on WPTS in 1990.  I don't even think "poser" is bad enough for 
him.  He's just a plain dork, a loser who should be ignored by any and 
everyone who has any input in what goes on in Pittsburgh.
k.
aww man....dont even get me started on him....theres no room for manny
on this list....there should be an official "manny theiner sucks"
mailing list.....id be on it...;)if you dont know who manny is, consider
yourself lucky....

Is it not true that Manny is sed 'dj Futurism' who's a few flyers of late
spinning 'drum & bass'?  Humorous and hypocritical.  But I have to put a
big BUT in here.  While i'v heard many a story about Manny's hypocracy,
bad attitude and even experienced it first hand, I must admit that he
deserves some props.  He's promoted more shit that wouldn't have been here
otherwise than anyone in the history of pgh.  He'd be a better ally than
enemy to the rave scene, as long its always on your own terms rather than
his.  Of course, ignoring is also an option.

So if everyone hates him so much, why don't they just run him out of the
city?  I mean, have people sold their souls to him, or what?  He seems to
be at the top of some bin, although I can't figure out which.  On some
misguided level, I can feel pity for him, for the life he led as a child
and what might have happened to him to make him feel this way.  Then
again, lots of bad things have happened to lots of good people.  You know
what they say about lemons and lemonade.  There are good people in the
world that have conquered adversity to become nice.  This boy needs a good
shrink, or maybe some valium.

> ... now i know everyone on this list dances ...

Please speak for yourself.  I really prefer not to dance.  Instead of an 
expressive, paganistic, active approach to music, I just like to chill 
and withdraw within myself.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against 
dancing or people who do it, but I just don't like it when people 
criticize me for not dancing.  I'll just be grooving to myself at a 
party and people will come up to me and say, "Come on.  Smile. Aren't 
you going to dance?  Aren't you going to have some fun?  Just let 
loose."  It's as if people think that the definition of "fun" is the 
same for everyone.

***As far as people in the Rave scene getting more "involved"... heh, what's
wrong with people loving the music, going to listen to it, and going home?
bleah I try to keep politics and charity in thier own places. If I want to
do good, I'll go to the red-cross and volunteer, or donate cash etc... I
don't need my buddies to help me or to look good in front of... Why not let
the scene be about what it's about, music, and dancing... I guess some
people feel the need to belong to a family? or to substitute for a family
that doesnt understand them? I can relate to that, my family doesnt'
understand me in the least :)***

You try to keep charity and politics in their own place? That's a nice 
fantasy world you live in. And guess what, there are a lot of us who like 
doing nice things for people. It's not trying to find a substitute family, 
cause honestly I like my real one, it's helping out and working for a cause 
and a better life for all. But hey, if you want lie back in your happy, well 
provided for life feel free, just don't expect anyone to offer you a hand 
when the going gets rough...

*** However, if a
normal looking mildly preppy kid went to a punk show he'd definitly get

    SO BEFORE YOU JUMP ON MY ASS THINK BEFORE YOU WRITE!
    You obviously missed the point of my message.  It was not about how
ravers should wear baggy pants and nautica jackets.  I have been keeping
quiet about this guy since the dance wars a few weeks ago.  I just had
to say something after his SCJ post.***

However, if a normal looking (What exactly is that anyway Johnny?) mildly 
preppy kid went to a punk show he'd definately get looks? I am going to make 
a vast stereotypical observation here, and I know of tons of exceptions but 
for this purpose I guess it will do, most of the kids I know that are punks 
and go to punk shows don't wear chains and leather jackets and have 
mohawks---they look preppy (if not 'nerdy') and no one of them gets weird 
looks or is treated badly. I don't think I missed the point of your message 
at all. You stated that because the kid is (in your highly acclaimed 
opinion) 'weird' looking that he should have no reason to criticize a type 
of music. Now first off he wasn't criticizing anything, just plainly stating 
he didn't understand why people liked it. What does how he looks have to do 
with it? And yes, you basically said that because he didn't dress like the 
'typical' raver he didn't fit in.
SO BEFORE YOU JUMP ON MY ASS THINK BEFORE YOU WRITE! (oh yeah...and figure 
out what you're trying to say so you don't have to change your message when 
it gets challenged.)


I said:

***>I am sick of going to parties only to be surrounded by ... 20 year
>olds dressing ... like 13 year olds (with their little kid back packs
>and whatever else a little kid would have).***

Aaron replied:

***That's great that you don't think people should judge punks based on
what they wear but maybe you should apply that same logic to your
judgment of ravers.***

True...I stand corrected...but it's more than clothes it's the "Wow I'm a 
little kid still" syndrome. And yes, I admit to having had that at one 
point...but it get old when you realize you really aren't 13 anymore even if 
you do hang out with kids that age. And someone said they felt insulted that 
I thought no one over 20 goes to parties. I never said that...I'm almost 
over 20 and all but 1 of the people I go to parties with is under 20...that 
is not what I was saying at all.

Tom said:
***I am honest, a little too honest at times and it gets me in trouble (such 
as
this, obviously)
Personally I think that if a discussion was purely "I love this stuff,
yeah me too" it would be pretty boring.  But if you all wanna mail bomb
me and tell me to shut up and stop saying what I do and dont like then I
will. Though I'll tell you I am gunna lay off a little more on when I
express my negative feelings since they seem to piss so many people off.***

Is this really what this list is about? Feeling that you have to edit your 
views on things because someone else may not like them (and then call you an 
ugly funny looking kid?). What kind of sense does that make? If that's the 
case then this list should just be abolished because there is no point. Just 
trash it and leave ROM up so we can get updates on upcoming events. I 
couldn't care less if everyone on this list hates me. I'm not here to make 
friends (and certainly judging who your friends are by what they write on a 
mailing list is lame to begin with), I'm here to voice my opinion and maybe 
work toward changing a 'scene' that looks to me as if it is going down hill. 
But as I said before, there are those out there who really care about the 
music and the dancing and I say rock on, keep doing it.

To Kira in Pgh and Jennifer Foulmood:

Right on sisters...


And now I am done with my rant...and shit was it long. I'm done. Anyone who 
has something to say to me post it but don't expect a reply, I have other 
things to do. if you feel it's important, e-mail me personally and we can 
bout it out, but I'm not going to bomb the list anymore with huge responses 
like this. I just think it's sad that the guy who was called funny looking, 
and started this all by stating a simple opinion, has now unsubbed from the 
list. Way to be open and understanding kids...

Excerpts from mail: 13-Feb-98 Re:  {pb-cle} I've got rhyt.. by
Finephunk@aol.com 
> most ravers dont have rythym or soul. when i say this i am not just
>talking about how they dance but also theyre selection in tunes as well.

oh my, someone got up on the wrong side of the bed.
I remember back in the day when people actually talked to each other at
parties. what's changed? is it the drugs? I would have to say no. lets
not forget the large part that drugs have played in rave culture. 
what about the ravers? do we blame the fact that parties suck on the
types of people that go to them? have the people in the scene changed
from the beginning? well, with parties being less underground, of course
there are fewer underground types. but newer ravers are often the least
cynical about things and have the best time.
so who do we blame a bad party on? blame it on your fucking self! only
you can ensure that you enjoy a party. a bad attitude can ruin the
phattest party, while a good vibe can ensure that you have a good time
at one which seems weak at the outset. here's a hint: don't go to a
party if you're in a bad mood and don't plan to enjoy it, cause you
won't.
anyway, that's my rant.
talk to people, give out candy, dance, spread the vibe

This is all hearsay, since I'm basically a new comer to every scene
imaginable (what can I say I was either sheltered or a good girl).  But I
thought he was most definitely a huge promoter for punk shows, and I'll
admit he does deserve SOME respect for that, but rave?  He's the newcomer
here!  Last summer he hated jungle and ravers and everything they stood
for, or at least he said (and I WAS in for that conversation!).


but why are we discussing Manny?  Is he really worth our time and effort?

oh...shit....you mean that, like i didn't get the email application for my
hardcore raver kit?!?!?!?  now what??  have i missed the one-time only, not
available in stores, specially priced offer to become a raver???  please
people....doesn't PLUR mean anything to anyone anymore???  if it's the
clothes, the dancing, or the drugs....i'll probably never be one of "you"
whoever you are.....if its the # of parties....maybe by the time i die i'll
make quota.....to someone who would most likely be considered very naive
about the scene i would think that someone out there other than me would be
in it for the people.....they may not all wanna be your pen-pal or your best
friend, but unless you come off as a hardass most of the time i've even been
able to get somone to share her water w/ me.....of all things!!!

everyone does things for their own reasons, but for me it's all about the
atmosphere of a good party and the people you meet chillin outside while
trying to cool off, dry off, and id the track the dj just masterfully spun
into something almost totally unrecognizable.  all i'm saying is get a grip
.....then let go!!!  what happened to doing something for the fun of
it.....now everyone's worried about people who wear certain threads or have
a certain technique to the way they dance.....WOULD EVERYONE BE HAPPY IF WE
ALL STOOD STILL TOTALLY NAKED WHILE LISTENING TO A DJ???

sorry...i'm a little tired and bitchy right now......

nothing but PLUR for everyone involved in the scene

Hey_You

You seem pretty pissed off at the world... I think you misread me :) I do
alot for the Red cross cause when I was 18 I was living on the street and
they gave me a place to live for a few weeks... The point I was trying to
get across is that I dont wanna feel pressured to do activity X when person
Y says so in order to feel accepted by a group of people I want to get
together and dance with... seems like mixing apples and oranges to me... I
will still do my bit for Charity, help others etc, but on my own terms. I
cant understand why the music has to be melded with public service.

in case people hadn't heard, future sounds has moved to squirrel hill. 
it's now on murray ave, across from the green grocer and kitty corner
from baker st. breads.  i think hobart is the cross st.

hopefully this means squirrel hill is going to become the progressive
dance music bohemia it alway wanted to be :)

Electronic music certainly existed before techno.  Kraftwerk is one of my
fav groups (we *are* the robots) and tremendously influential.  All
the Detroit greats cite Kraftwerk as an influence, but Kraftwerk's sound
is still fairly different from techno proper.

Btw, for anyone interested, a 2 CD compilation of Derrick May classics is
available from Transmat records.  If you go to their site at
www.transmat.com, you can listen to some stuff online (not at all sure
what format it's in) and trust me that it's super super super fly.

LOOK, do I have to explain this every 6 weeks, when some LAME POSER NEWBIE
tries to join the RAVE SCENE? Heres the stat's you need to be a REAL
RAVER:

	Poser	1 week or 1 clubnight
	Newbie	1 month or 1 houseparty
	Pre-Raver  2 months or 1 rave or 1 pair of "phat" pants
 		   or 1 hit of acid
	Raver	3 months, pending on these factors:
			1 hit of E must have been consumed
			1 rave must be attended every weekend
			1 bag of lollypops must have been distributed
	Junglist   3 months, pending on these factors:
			1 blunt must be smoked before and after all events
			1 jungle party (not rave) every week
			Must look like a hardguy.					
	Hardcore Raver	1 year, pending on these factors:
			Rave every week, on the guest list of half.
			Must attend every clubnight, houseparty, and
			renegade.
			Diet must consist of no less than 2/3 sugar.
			Diet must consist of no less than 1/3 illicit
			chemicals.
			Must trainspot any tune within two bars.
			Must be able to shoot mixtapes out your butt, 
			and liquid E out your nostrils, beatbox
			Trancecore, speak in tongues, and save the
			universe from impending doom all the while 
			dancing on beat for no less than 24 hours -
			WITH NO WATER!

If you read these rules, you'd see it clearly states that it takes one
year, six months and a week to go from being a poser to a hardcore raver.
I hope everything is cleared up now. ;)

 the only real hardcore raver,

Although I thought I had been raving for two years, I find I have been
totally misguided.  Unfortunately, I haven't completed all of the
requirements for Hardcore Raver.  I'll get right on it, sir, and report
back when all requirements have been met!

    A couple people on the list have posted wanting a netmeet at G-Spot.
Whoever suggested meeting outside the bathrooms at around midnight, I
think that would probably be the best time and place for most of us.
Depending on how many people show up, I just can't see everybody piling
up against the right speaker. Not comfortably, anyway.

    If anyone is interested, I'll be wearing a very bright gold addias
shirt with blue strips down the sleeve. (the same one I had on at BiZ,
for those that were there) I'm about 5'11 and have long brown hair
(probably pulled back) Please feel free to come up and say hi. I'd love
to meet some more people on here.

    Hope to see everyone tomorrow night!!


    peace,

    --spike

It's probably an umbrella, prefabricated, ready-for-your-digestion term.

Helo People on the Server:

Has anyone read Huxley's [Brave New World].  It is a really great book,
inclusive.  I am reading the condensed version b/c it is the only version
available + i am lazy and i recognize futility (sometimes).  Well, anyway, I
came across part of the book where the Alpha Members (genetically engineered
smart ones) go to the fortnightly (is that three weeks?) "Solidarity
Services."  I was shocked at how much it paralleled the rave "scene" in
purpose/objective and in the actual ceremony.  Hey, read for yourself... :)

[begin copywrited materiel]

    The President stood up, made the sign of the T, and, turning on the
synthetic music, released the soft, tireless beating of drums and the low
sweet notes of instruments that repeated and repeated the brief, familiar
melody of the First Solidarity Hymn.  Again, again -- and the tune stirred
and gripped, not the ear, not the mind, but the heart, the soul.
    The President made the sign of the T and sat down.  The service had
begun.  The blessed soma tablets were placed in the centre of the dinner
table.  The loving cup of strawberry ice-cream soma was passed from hand  to
hand and, with the sentence "I drink to my end", twelve times tasted.  Then,
accompanied by the snythetic orchestra, the first Soidarity Hymn was sung.

        Ford, we are twelve; oh, make us one,
        Like drops within the Social River;
        Oh, make us now together run
        As swiftly as thy shining Flivver.

    Twelve verses, full of the same deep feeling.  And then the loving cup
was passed a second time.  All drank.  Tirelessly the music played.  The
drums beat.  The Second Solidarity Hymn was sung.

        Come, Greater Being, Social Friend,
        Annihilating Twelve-in-One!
        We long to die, for when we end,
        Our larger life has just begun.

    Again Twelve verses.  By this time the soma had begun to work.  Eyes
shone, cheeks glowed, happy, friendly smiles broke out on every face.....

[end copywrited material]

{and you can just guess what happens from there}

I could write a paper on the similarities.  Huxley, the orginal "raver".

goodnight

Andrew

If you want to get transcendental about how you get your energy...

I've never tried a smart drink; i'm sure there is some hidden effect or
obligation that your body endures after you ingest [shrinks your pituitary
gland...j/k].  But, I have found that if you eat a lot of carbohydrates and
proteins (pj sandwiches, etc) you'll have all the energy you need for the
night.  Moreover, if you are excited enough by the music and the fact that
you are raving and dancing [synchronized with your environment, etc], the
enzymes/chemicals/neurotransmitters that your body produces (as a result of
neuro stimuli) will give you ample assistance and will eat up the
carbohydrates and proteins that you had just stuffed stuffed in your mouth.
Just a late night view, nope-not taking a stand against chemicals...just an
opinion.

*    If you're not making chemicals the olde fashioned way, you should be
thrown out on your ass :P    *

Does anyone still have their Biz bracelet on?  Mine is getting funky.

in case people hadn't heard, future sounds has moved to squirrel hill. 
it's now on murray ave, across from the green grocer and kitty corner
from baker st. breads.  i think hobart is the cross st.

hopefully this means squirrel hill is going to become the progressive
dance music bohemia it alway wanted to be :)

i love to dance but i think it's just as respectable to sit back and feel
the love (if u can feel any).  sometimes i just like to soak it up.
watching ppl dance is just as fun as dancing myself, especially when i
can find interesting ppl to spy on.

so did anyone go to this?  i went at the bathrooms at 12:00 but i never
have any luck meeting at net meets...i was that short asian girl wearing
a vest and really big cargo pants with a lost look on her face...i know
this had been brought up before but we really need like a sign or
something.  i'm much too shy to just walk up to anybody. plus you never
know who's who...

anyways, i'm much too tired to get into a huge review but hey what was
up with  aux 808?  that booty bass was over the edge...it wasn't even
good booty music.
also dave hollands set was pretty nice.  i think he was having needle
problems though and everytime i was getting into the groove than there
would be like major skipping but like i said overall it was sweet.
does anyone know that guy who was spinning jungle, was it 7up?  his set
was painful to my ears. he had like this huge red blinking thingy my
friend said it was a beatmatcher but i guess it didn't work too well
because his set was horribly beatmatched. anyways bad boy bill was worth
the drive to ohio and worth listening to that bad booty smacking
music....his set was better than it was at brassmonkey II.  anyways
overall i was pretty impress with that ohio party.  the space was nice,
not too big not too small and the visuals were nice and the sound was
very nice almost as good as the urb tour two years ago.  yeah,
pittsburgh needs a space like that...
i'm sad i didn't get to meet anyone on this list but next time i suppose.

it's called the Mayday mix. it was a japanese import at
one time but was rereleased on the UK Open label so it's
much easier to find now.

yeah I went, I was rolling pretty hard tho and didnt remember to go to the
porta-potties till like 12:15, and didnt see anyone there when I did? I'm
willing to be a geek and wear some sort of "pb-cle" piece of paper on my
shirt at Terminal Velocity tho :)


Yeah I have to agree, I'm no expert on mixing, but I heard alot of bad
transitions... I love Jungle music tho so I was still having a good time, if
you dont like jungle you may not have liked much of the music? Seemed like
ALOT of jungle :)

I loved the lights, I'm not sure how good lights get at these parties, but I
thought those were awesome...

The space was pretty large and everything, but it was so damn dirty... You'd
think they could like pay to have it sweeped or something? everything I wore
was totally dirt-trashed... woulda been cleaner to go to an outside Rave
probably.

Herm I'm not sure if I'll drive to anymore of these out of state events...
the ride home was painfull.

Yep, identification of fellow pb-cle's is hard especially when they say:
"aw yeah, I'm the short white kid with baggy pants."  Badges are a good
idea, or maybe some secret handshake or dance move!

Did anyone besides me happen to notice that whoever is throwing terminal
velocity is advertising DV8 (Live) as Luke Slater aka DV8 instead of John
Slater.  Not to say that John Slater isn't a good musician, because he is, but
he is no Luke Slater ;) Normally this wouldn't be a big deal to get a guy's
first name wrong, but when you go and change it to a euro-techno god it would
seem like quite a mistake.  I also don't think the Dever is booked for this
party, but i'm not 100% sure on that.  
If anyone knows the deal with the Dever i'd like to know.. thanks

here's my little g-spot review:

got there about 12:30, huge as line, froze my hands off waiting to get
in (silly
me was in a tshirt).

music: heard the end of david hollins set, it was a'ight. Aux 88 was
dope, liked the last song they played ... hmmm breaks + booty = get my
ass movin' ... Cirrus was fun also, couple of songs i knew an' dug ...
the dj in between ... hmmm ... maybe i just wasn't in a D&B mood, but i
wasn't diggin his set. Some nice tricks / scratchin ... but alot of the
mixes seemed off (like it seemed like he took the wrong record off a
couple of times ;) ... BBBill, good ... glad he spun a little breaks ...
where was Humpty? its ok k', since i really don't dig humpty as much as
bb. Next, Maseo ... dag ... i had been itchin for some slow breaks all
nite and the hip hop hit the spot. Unfortunatly, no more water half way
through his set ment i had to leave. (Me and my friends where gettin
dehydrated.)

Other sh*t: someone decided to take a dump on the toilet seat, nice
touch. almost stepped in some puke another nice touch. The lights where
pretty cool, and the sound was nice, if a bit painfull right next to the
speakers.

Complaints: what up with the large breaks between sets? no real
continuaty between DJ's / PAs. The water situation sucked. (no running
water, atleast 
bottles were only $1 though).

peace

ps. I was the kid in the orange huntin jacket/cammie hat, with menace

you had no problem giving a sense of eurythmics to jungle in your well
written essay, here, but i think Dave was trying to communicate that techno
is more enjoyable to him. Imagine what jungle has that gives it a sense of
rythm. hmm. something to think about. THen imagine what techno has that
gives it the same.  BLAM there is nothing to think about. ITs immediately
obvious that techno has that quality that is  "a priori" or immediate sense
of rythm. Nothing to really talk about. Something to dance to...

I play live stuff from a  synthesizer. I don't consider my stuff any more
good than vinyl. MY rule of thumb is, IF its a really good techno, theres
something wrong if it AIN'T on vinyl. btw, anyone selling a dubplate
presser? (not that i can afford one:)

Ih have to disagree. the most popular of the modulars is Rolands Juno106,
which makes about the opposite of thick rich sounds. AIt makes tight and
metallic sounding sounds and they aren't overlaped with frequency bandwiths
at all. Sure, there is a chorus button (woopie) but that sort of just
doubles the waveform.
the TR 808 and 909 are great machines and have analogue modelling, like the
novation drumstation. I wouldnt advise anyone to get a TR-808 or 909 for
the price you can get a drumstation.

Lets face it newer technology is so much better than old technology. IF
youre jsut getting into making music, you arent going to be successful
making classical techno. IF yoou want thick rich sounds, get a YAMAHA
ANI-X, oR aROLAND JP-8000. the Nordlead is good for wiggly sounds too. But
i have to say that old gear sucks in comparison to newer products. Its a
matter of time before technoheads realize that one can do everything plus
more with one jp-8000 than four juno106's combined.

btw, the 808 and the 909 kick and snare were original rendered on the
juno106. TR 808 and 909 machines emulate samples from that. Those drum
machines use sample based synthesis although they call it analogue. absurd.

i like using the word techno. i mean what the hell does tech house mean?
its still techno. what is darkstep? its techno in disguise. Jungle is
techno. don't you remeber calling it jungle techno when no one knew what
"jungle" meant?

gotta go to class.

The Dj that spun (???) jungle for like 2 1/2 hours  was Titonton.

Another thing, Wasn't anybody really mad that they spent $25 and 2 of the
headliners didn't show up !!?? (no Donald Gluad, or R. Humpty Vision!)
And to put a locaish Dj on from 2am till 4:30 was absurd!! - I'm sure that
everyone would have liked to see some tallent that you only get to see on
occassion, instead of someone you see all the time.. (unless it's me of
course!  ;) )

Alot of the new promoters (especially here in Cleveland) need to take a few
notes from some of the party promoters from around the US and Europe, and
even us old skool fools from Cleveland..
Make the night a journey, progress the styles of music in a way that they
flow together, don't just stick on a dj or act because he/she is cryin
about playin, or is a star, build up to a climax in the night then take the
crown down from the climax to the morning.
A party should be like a dj's set. Start kind of nice but reserve a bit of
energy for later, slowly build.....build.....build... and then explode and
peak out for a while then slowly take the energy down and down till it's
more of a huge, fat, thick, vibe, groovin kind of morning thing!!

Hopefully the people who need to learn read this, cause I'm gettin sick of
Cleveland parties being like rock concerts,.....

ie... Ok that last act... uh I mean Dj was dj mud flap...
And now ....Cleveland are you ready to ROCK!!!!
All the way from shaved balls, Minnosota....
Dj Krackrock!!! COme on give it up......

     Yeah, I have.  Although, granted, it's been awhile.  It's most 
undoubedly an awesome book.

>fortnightly (is that three weeks?) 

     It's two weeks.

     Just be careful how you interpret the book.  "Brave New World" is 
an "_anti_-utopian" novel.  Taken at face value, it may seem like it's 
espousing the value of the given society, however, it's totally 
sarcastic.  It's trying to convice people that the world would actually 
be a shitty place if we achieved the much-dreamt-of "Utopia".
     There are definite similarities that can be drawn between the rave 
scene and the society depicted in the book, however, the book's main 
purpose is to point out the _negative_ aspects of the society it 
depicts.  Thus, any major similarities that are drawn between the rave 
scene and the book can, realistically, only serve to cast the rave scene 
in a negative light.  But, perhaps this is deservedly so.

Brave new World is a great novel.  I see it more as a consumerist society.
the oppisite novel to this is 1984 by Orwell the same person who wrote
Animal Farm.  I think these novels are about rival economic systems,
communism and capitalism.  I think Brave new World is more of a social
commetary.

I won't argue with you that my synth run down was oversimplified in the
extreme.  My basic point was that the techno sound is tied to the sound of
analogue equipment.  Even digital equipment tries to capture this. The 
Nordlead (which is an asskicker imho), for example, provides digital
emulation of analogue circuits.  I completely agree with you that there's
a lot of good sounding digital equipment out there now and people need not
be analogue snobs about it.

Lets not forget though that older equipment still has a number of
advantages.  It can be gotten for much cheaper than new stuff if you know
what your looking for.  For example, one can get a fatman for around 50,
or a juno for less than 300 (if one looks hard enough).  In addition, the
interfaces are usually much more interesting for a beginner.  Looking for
a new interesting sound?  Just tweak some knobs!  Some digital equipment
also has this property, like the Nordlead, but you're going to pay through
the nose for it.  And then there's just the fact that analogue synths have
individual character.

I'm not in any way trying to challenge your synth-expertise, more to point
out that the un-ending digital/analogue argument doesn't really have a
clean cut answer.  Use what works for you eh?  (Though I still stick to my
position that techno's sound derives from the way old analogue shit
sounds)

Yeah, its sample based at the bottom, but the filters and processing and
such are analogue which is what gives it it's distinctive sound anyway.

I think the issue here is that what I originally wrote has to be taken
very purely as a reaction to the original message, not as my own complete
exposition on what techno is. The one and only point was that there's
sub-zero evidence that "great techno artists" have some kind of aversion
to vinyl and analogue sounds.

I agree with you and I don't agree with you.  Once again, I think this has
been distorted by the flow of the thread.  In the original request for
responses, "techno" was being used to refer to the specific genre.  The
replier also treated it as such but then proceeded to give a bizarre and
fundamentally wrong description of said genre.  So it was basically this
that I was arguing with.  For the most part I use the term in the
classical sense.  But I can also understand when people use it in a
totally general way, especially seeing as it's a lot better word than
"electronica" for instance.  So, to sum it up, there's a lot of semantic
confusion going on with the term, which I don't think is all that
important, but if one is going to try and describe "techno the specific
genre" then at least get it straight.

God that was a confusing paragraph and I apologize for the excessive use
of quotes  :-)

On a meta-content note, it's cool to see people talking about actual gear
on the list.  It can only be good for the list to have musical discussion
at a level other than:  "I like jungle because blar blar blar"  "I don't
like jungle because bleh bleh bleh" "You're an idiot cause you don't like
jungle!"  etc. etc. ad nauseum.  In a similar way I was also pretty
impressed with whoever's dissection of jungle's rythmic properties (I
think maybe it was jen foulmood?)

And totally un-related to any of the rest of this, your chill-bience tape
is really really pleasant (bet ya didn't know I'd heard that didja? :-)

Regards,
Tom.

> why would you ever say those 2 guys from kent will beat danny and phantom???

well this is based on what i have heard from them in the past few weeks. i
went to future in cleveland & phantom 45 was on first & he was playing
some decent music but it slowed down at times & he wasn't consistently
keeping people up and dancing. he did a few tricks that were ok but 
nothing really great. 

also i got this from the mw list from when jes posted a review of hugz +
kisses in chicago:

> phantom dropped perhaps the most boring jungle set ive heard in a whiole.

danny went on next & what he was spinning was even a little slower & it
was kind of on the atmospheric side, not really stuff that gets people
moving + jumping and crazy. and his tricks were also mediocre + far
between. he kept doing this sample that was something about a classic but
i don't remember the exact wording, it just had classic in it. it must
have been on the digital sampler or something because i heard it at least
15 times over the whole set + he wasn't reaching for a new record every
time. it got pretty old. when he spun at we can't be stopped he did
better but not spectacular.

but everytime i see rob (i don't know his dj name) and joe aka ground zero
spin, they are playing at about 180 bpm with mad tricks + cutting +
scratching + interesting mixing techiniques all throughout the set, all
their tricks are always on, people are dancing + cheering + there's so
many people around them you can't see them. they spun once with each of
them on 2 turntables with a 3rd mixer in between so they could
simulatneously tagteam + mix into each other's records + pull off twice as
many tricks. i had never seen anybody do that before.

so that's why i would ever say that.

and about future, it was fun, the space has such high ceilings like 3
stories, i wish they could make use of that. there are 4 screens + some
light racks that all weren't being used that were right above the dance
floor. the 1148 people should move those racks up + the screens back. i
like high ceilings. the dance floor is nice and big. but the DJ setup area
is behind this big wall so you can't see any thing. aaron said the week
before he had hooked up a video cast thing of the djs but it wasn't
working that week. i think the DJs should spin in the corner at floor
level (because i like to see the real thing) but he said the space owners
won't let them do that. =(

were smart they should've switched him with Maseo...cuz hip hop is good
to listen to for about half an hour for me than it just gets boring (music
has evolved so much since the hip hop daze)...altho i appreciated his mc

     Although [Brave New World]'s society probably has some capitalistic 
attributes, I don't think the society as a whole can be considered 
capitalistic.  I mean, think of how planned the economy in it is!  This 
is how I see it: 
     The basic difference between communism and capitalism is that, in 
communism, the most important thing is equality, and, in capitalism, the 
most important thing is freedom.  Taking that into consideration, [Brave 
New World] can be considered neither communistic NOR capitalistic.  
People in Huxley's book are definitely not equal, but nor do they have 
much freedom.  In [Brave New World]'s society, the most important thing 
is something else, it's happiness.

I was at the bathrooms at midnight and ran into Spike, rememberd he 
said he'd be wearin a gold addidas shirt, which sure caught my eye!  
We hung around untill about 20 after, but didn't find anybody 
else...My friend mark came to my house before the party with a couple 
of his friends from pitts, one of which turned out to be JunglAlien, 
so I met him too :)  Saw StevieT wanderin around lookin pissed off 
but didn't get a chance to say hey :)    I agree, I think we should 
have a big sign, or all start wearing those badges or something..I'm 
too shy to just walk up to anybody too :)

> anyways, i'm much too tired to get into a huge review but hey what was
> up with  aux 808?  that booty bass was over the edge...it wasn't even
> good booty music.

I thought Aux88 ROCKED, but thas just me :)  I was really 
dissapointed that I had missed him at 420, so I was reeeely excited 
to see him at Gspot.  One thing I didn't like tho was the DJ he had 
spinnin, what was with that?  Was that part of the PA or was Aux 
havin tech. difficulties or what? 

> also dave hollands set was pretty nice.  i think he was having needle
> problems though and everytime i was getting into the groove than there
> would be like major skipping but like i said overall it was sweet.

Yea, the needle skippin sucked, but aside from that I loved his set, 
I think that was the highlight of my night!  I caught him a couple 
weeks ago at Kinetic too :)  Whatever it is he plays (I'm still not 
fully up on all the little technical names of all the different 
stylleez, like I said, I'm still a poser..teehee...would it be 
techno?) is definatly my favorite kind o music, he totaly got me 
groovin and me an my little group of friends were just dancin our 
asses off, it was great!

> does anyone know that guy who was spinning jungle, was it 7up?  his set
> was painful to my ears. he had like this huge red blinking thingy my

No, I think 7up spun early mornin, I think your talkin about 
Titonton..As I think StevieT said, he's more of a dj's dj..He's 
awesome to watch, but hard to get a groove to.  I thought his set was 
waay outta place tho, started grating on my ears too..Like SleepyC 
said, that time spot shouldn't have been filled with a local, not 
that Titonton isn't great, but the party kinda lost it's "flow", and 
there were so many kids just standin around starin, like "what the 
fucK??"  I didn't see any big red blinky thing tho, and I can't 
imagine him usin a beat counter..and all beat counters i've seen are 
pretty small, like you'd have never seen them from the floor..they're 
usually just 2 small little lights by, or on, the mixer....*shrug*

> friend said it was a beatmatcher but i guess it didn't work too well
> because his set was horribly beatmatched. anyways bad boy bill was worth
> the drive to ohio and worth listening to that bad booty smacking
> music....his set was better than it was at brassmonkey II.  anyways

I dunno, I was pretty dissapointed with his set...I guess I just had 
it all hyped up in my head that it was gunna be this huge awesome ass 
bomb set, and not that it was bad, but it was just like listenin to 
his cd...although I was expectin him to be tag teamin with humpy 
vision..ohwell...he looks/acts like he has a big ego tho..

> overall i was pretty impress with that ohio party.  the space was nice,
> not too big not too small and the visuals were nice and the sound was
> very nice almost as good as the urb tour two years ago.  yeah,
> pittsburgh needs a space like that...

There have been a few other parties at that space, but I had never 
been there before.. I was really impressed tho, I thought they had it 
done up real nice.. The lights were incredible! big up to Chip an the 
WeAreOne kids (I think that's who they are, they're always wearin 
those shirts anyways :)  Sound was pretty nice too

All in all I had a really good time...I've completely stopped my use 
of chemicals tho (personal reasons...) and I found myself getting 
extremely tired and irratable pretty early in the morning even tho I 
slept almost all saturday...ended up leaving in the middle of Maseo's 
set..I just don't think I'm cut out for this stayin up all night long 
stuff anymore..must be gettin old and crochity or sumptin :)  
Shouts to Eric(Junglalien) an spike!  hope to meet more of ya in the 
future, heh 

Chris

|     Just be careful how you interpret the book.  "Brave New World" is

Yeah, I am sort of on a dystopia kick; maybe because we live in one.  I
recognized the satire, it's very amusing, altho I can't recall anything.
Hey, everyone on the list read [Brave New World] and at the next event I
will blast a whistle at 230 for a "time out", and we will all get in a
circle and try to talk about the book.

integrating literature into the active rave culture,
Andy

remembers...oh yeah, the part where the alphas are brainwashed into thinking
that people who wear (CACC IES) are dumb or something.  + I liked the part
where they burn the bodies and use the phosphorus for plant use -- highly
efficient.  + the part where the babies get shocked...still at the
beginning.

    I meant to post my G-Spot review sooner, but you know how it is. :)
Anyway, I *rolled* in right around midnight, just in time for the netmeet. I
met up with Chris, which was cool. I just wish that a few more of the
pb-cle'ers would have stopped over. Getting to the party was an adventure of
it's own. (isn't is always...) My friend Mark had his birthday on Saturday and
his dad was kind enough to let him use his van, which we squeezed about 10
people into. After a painful drive to Cleavland from Pittsburgh, I finally got
to experience the Cleavland scene for the first time. One thing that you never
usually see at Pittsburgh events that caught my attention was the absence of
any kind of security or searching, and hey, get this, there were no problems
the whole night. (not that I saw anyway) Wonder if there's a connection there.

    As for the djs: Aux88 was good at times but I hated those dancers (i
didn't remember seeing 'lil Kim on the flyer, hmmm...) and when he did his
little bits of mcing, he had so much effects on the vocals that I couldn't
understand a thing he said. The next few djs were decent although I was too
busy dancing to take note of who was up on stage. (btw, I liked the way the
turntables were supported up on those cynder blocks. it gave that added,
industrial/warehouse touch... ;> )  I took a little nap around 5 and woke up
to light shining through the windows. 7up was spinning then (i think) and his
set got me awake and back on the dance floor. We left around 8:50 (seems like
the party ran over a bit, which wsa nice...) and were on our way back to the
'burgh. After dropping everybody off, I finally got home around 2:00pm, took a
shower, and then a nice little nap.

    All in all, I had an awesome time. I got a little dirty and had to bum
water off of people the whole night (after I ran out of cash), but I guess
that's all part of the deal. The vibe was pretty good and all you cleavland
heads are a fun bunch to be with. The warehouse, complete with covered parked
cars (one of which was my bed for a few hours <grin> ) and people dancing on
the boats, was a great space, the sound was very good (with speakers in the
front and middle of the space), and the people I got to meet were all very
cool. Oh yeah, one more thing, trying to go to the bathroom, while having the
entire port-a-john you're standing in vibrate to the massive bass outside, is
an experience I won't soon forget.

    Well, there's my review. Sorry for the mess of it all, but I gotta get
started on all the work I've been putting off the whole weekend.

    peace,

    --spike

p.s. Once again, shoutout to Chris from the list and everyone I rode down
with.  Let's start planning the netmeet for terminal velocity now so it might
actually work... who's planning on going? How does 3:00am by the bathrooms
sound?? I'll wear my nice, bright, gold addias shirt again!

Where do I start..

1. I didn't make the 12:00 net meet. I try to avoid bathroom net meets if I
can. Usually alot of people around the bathrooms, waiting in line..ect ect.
Not to mention I wasn't there until 1-1:30 anyhow. Next time I will make a
sign and tape it to the wall, therefore when the clock strikes 2:00, 12:00
whatever..we can just generate towards the sign..hehe

2. I thought the vibe was pretty good....people went out of their way to talk
to you, introduce themselves..ect ect which I like. 

3. Okay...the Aux performance...well Stevie(steviet216) and I had discussed it
was alot like a concert...I had fun watching the performance, would have had a
better time dancing to it. I just wasn't digging it..call me crazy. 

4. Well now that someone mentions it, It does make me a little mad that the 2
headliners didn't make it, after I paid $25..not that I went to see them,
however they are part of the reason it was $25

5. Okay, I like hip hop and all, but jesus that set went on and on and...you
get the picture. I was ready to fall asleep by the end of that set. I could
have saved 25 bucks and got a hip hop fix for free along w/ some quality
breaker entertainment..

Okay Im going to quit bitching now..I honestly had a good time. The music at
the afterhours was AWESOME!!!! My mind was saying dance, but the rest of me
was saying sit on your ass..The AOL crew was in full effect on Sat, that was
nice to be w/ everybody and to finally meet Casey(HANSLGRETL)

>From my understanding, the basic difference between communism and
capitalism is property.  Whereas communism advocates the elimination
of private property and capitalism is based upon the aquisition of
it.  Communism's goal is a stateless society; capitalism's, a free
market.

I think, perhaps more deeply, it's based on money.  Communists are
equal because money becomes irrelevant.  Capitalists are free as long
as they have money.

Humans being what they are, greed and corruption usually end up
polluting and destroying both.  But we're a hearty and inventive
lot.  Eventually we'll come up with something that is not only
sustainable but philosophically rational, too.

Or something like that.  ;)

I might be wrong but isn't Aux 88 two people ("BJ" and "Tom Tom")?
I've never seen them play.  Every time I saw them listed on a flyer,
it was always as a live PA, there was always some problem or excuse
for why they couldn't play live, and it always turned out that one
of them just spun records.

I never saw an actual flyer for G-Spot, and the e-flyer I read
didn't specify what they'd be doing there.  Were they billed as a PA
or just DJing?

Does anyone have anything further to add to this?

hmm....i tend to think of myself as a socialist of sorts, and i think 
that freedom and equality really go hand in hand in the hypothetical 
socialist society...

I would really like to put some faces to the words I read.  The sign seems
like an interesting idea, but you always have those evil people who think
it's funny to fuck with other people's business.  At Hullabaloo, they had
a sign in table and nametags, and while that sounds very convention-like,
it's also an interesting idea.  If we want to have a net meet, I think we
should definately know who we're looking for.  We should have badges of
some sort (so I can rip them from your breast and thrown them in the dirt,
forever disgracing you in the eyes of your peers, if I so deem).  But how
would we distribute them?  Who would print them up?  What do we think of
the T-shirt idea.  There are several promoters that have shirts, why can't
we?  Anyway, if we somehow miss each other at the designated site, perhaps
there should be some other means of identification.  Just a thought.

Jenifer Foulmood

ps  I look forward to meeting any of you at Terminal Velocity!

hmm, I'm really liking this thread.  Sorta like being on analog heaven
(the analog-guru mailing list), but I'm understanding most of what is
being said.

As a beginning producer (or whatever it is they call someone who makes
this type of music), I must say that I prefer the old analog stuff.  Most
of the reasons are what tom already mentioned (the guy knows his stuff):
CHEAPER!!!, knobs and dials are pretty intuitive and all the stuff sounds
exactly like stuff I have on vinyl.  As for the Juno, it can be pretty
warm if you play around with it for awhile, with both the "poly" buttons
on it use all 6 voices for a note giving it quite a nice big warm sound.

Anywayz, can anyone recommend some good, cheap and probably old gear that
is a worthwhile purchase?  In particular I am looking to eventualy buy a
sampler and some more synths (hopefully one that can give a nice acid
sound).

pEace,
jP

Greedo: No, why would...? Ah, perhaps you have been misled by my name.=20
While my name is indeed Greedo, I think you will find I am no greedier=20
than anyone else. I am a man of modest means and meager salary, but I=20
assure you I am content with my lot in life.

HL: We saw you in Star Wars trying to get lots of money from Han Solo.=20
Do you go around trying to collect big sums of money because of=20
incredibly consuming feelings of greed?

G: Of course not. While it is true that I am a collection agent in=20
employ of Jabba the Hut, I only see that debts are paid. The money does=20
not go to me. Besides, my culture abolished money thousands of your=20
Earth years ago. Frankly, I don't even understand the concept. We find=20
your custom of using scraps of paper to represent wealth laughable.

HL: Now in that scene you had a gun. Didn't Han Solo have to draw his=20
own gun under the table because he knew if you saw it you would want it=20
too? Isn't wanting two guns just plain greedy?

G: Ahem. Let me refresh your memory. Han Solo drew that gun=20
surreptitously because he wanted to shoot me. Which he did, a very=20
painful laser beam in the belly. I do have to hand it to him, it was a=20
very crafty move. I never even saw it coming. However, what I wish Mr.=20
Solo and others like him would realize is that I'm only trying to do my=20
job. Shooting me under the table with a laser blaster is like blaming=20
the weather man when it rains. I'd like to stress to your readers: It's=20
really not my fault if there is a large bounty on your head. Please do=20
not take it out on me.

HL: Weren't you mad that your part in the movie was so small? Out of=20
greediness for fame, isn't it true that you wanted to hog all the screen=20
time and the change the title of the movie to Star Wars Starring Greedo?

G: In fact, no. I am an admittedly minor figure and am happy with the=20

This is totally non-rave, but....
Read Tales of the bounty Hunters, edited by Kevin Anderson, which is 
considered canon by Lucasarts.  Greedo is a novice on his first job, and is a 
teenager.  Basically he is set up by other bounty hunters, as he has a bounty, 
but they don't want to kill him themselves.  
Back to our normal program, eh?

First off, I'd like to give a big shout out to all of the lists that are
receiving this. I apologize for the massive cross post, but this will
only be a one time thing and I think it's something that could
definitely help a lot of us.

    Ok, here's the deal. I'm posting this in search of a team (myself
plus two other people) for an internet scholarship I'm entering. The
basic idea behind the contest is to get together with other students to
create a series of web pages which successfully educate other students
and teachers on a certain topic. Based on my personal experiences, most
of my friends and others I talk to really have no idea whatsoever as to
what's involved in the rave/party scene at all. Now, by no means am I an
expert, but I think it would be a very worthwhile project for a few of
us to get together, share what we have learned, and, possibly, give some
people a look at something that we all love that they otherwise might
not get the chance to experience. I have hundreds of ideas for content,
etc, etc. but right now, I need to get a team application finalized no
later than February 28th. (next Sat!)  If you are AT ALL interested,
please email me by the end of this week, Feb 22nd, (this Sunday!) at
spike@nb.net with something to the effect of 'Rave Team' in the subject.
I'll need some time to sort everything out. In your message, please
include some general info about yourself, (who you are, where you're
from, etc, etc), some rave/party-specific info (what you feel you can
offer to the team, what it's meant to you), and if you have any HTML
editing or artistic talent. Please don't think I'll be sitting here with
a checklist crossing people off because they didn't 'make the cut' or
anything like that, I'm just trying to get an idea of who I'll be
dealing with and what they have to contribute.

    Anyway, I hope that a few of you out there will share in my 'vision'
and will want to work with me on this. If you decide to do this, please
know in advance that it will probably mean several hours of work per
week on your part. At the same time, the rewards can be worth it. (First
Prize is $25,000 per member  :>  plus the satisfaction of seeing your
page internationally recognized, etc, etc...) I'm not trying to scare
anyone off, I just don't want anybody to get committed to this and then
not have the time to follow through it making it work.

    Again, my apologies for the cross-posting, but I hope this ends up
helping a few of you out there. I look forward to hearing from anyone
interested.

    peace,

I strongly believe that in the long-term, this is probably best for
everyone who really gives a damn about this scene.  I'm in the
midwest, and as far as I'm concerned, things are as good as they are
here (IMO) _because_ so few people know what's involved.  And as I
figure it, the more people that figure stuff out, the worse things
are going to get.

"Here, here is our fucked-up new-age post-hippie culture hiding under
flowery pretenses of PLUR and spreading that 'lovvin vibe'."  Yes,
there's beauty and real love and some fucking amazing music and some
unique experiences... but judged both by the majority without and
within, it's a drug culture and a parental nightmare more than
anything.

Okay, perhaps this is a bit overstating things, but the point is
that unless you present all sides of this "scene" equally, within
proper context and with proper emphasis... you're preaching, not
educating.

If people really want to find out what's going on, it's not exactly
like we're hiding.
  
It's difficult to argue against spreading commericalism out of one
side of your mouth, and invite everyone and everything in as loudly
as possible with the other.  Which side of the fence are you
perching on?

Keep the sound underground... at least as much as you can, for as
long as you can.  Please.

Theoretically that's $50,000.  I wasn't there but from everything
I've read there's no way that party should have cost even $15K.  So
you do the math and see how much the promoter walked away with...
most likely tax-free.

There's an INCREDIBLE amount of cash to be made by shady promotion.
It doesn't even require, honestly, all that much work for what you
can make.  

So it's no wonder that more smart/bad people are "catching on".
It's no wonder that DJs and PAs are charging such astronomical fees.
It's no wonder that we're attracting so much negative attention and
hassle.  

It's no wonder that we keep getting fucked.

There's only two ways you can combat ('cause you're not going to
stop) it.  1)  raise holy hell when it happens and you have people
responsible to complain to or other potential customers of these
assholes to tell of, and 2) DON'T SUPPORT/ATTEND THEIR EVENTS.

It may seem simple.  Obvious, even.  But until more people actually
_do_ something, what's to change anything?

And then when we take off the tape, we can just flip it over and WA-LA ->
we have a fine home-made tupee'.  Its really a win-win situation.

But what if you don't have a pet?  I say Zoo animals make a lovely
substitution.  Perhaps we can get a group rate on renting out some pumas.

Your head count is way too high, Steve.  But even if they did make $10,000
to $15,000 in profit, what's your point?  That people shouldn't make a
profit?  

Well, if a promoter can't make a little pop once in a while on a very good
turnout, then prepare yourself for lousy shows for the rest of the era
because the only people who will be promoters are idiots who are too
illogical to reason that it isn't worth all the time, effort and
headaches -- not to mention the financial risk and liability involved.  

These events are literally planned 5-10 months in advance now.  When you
look at the seemingly great profit, it's just mediocre when amortized over
this period.  Promoters of great parties deserve great profits for their
efforts.  If a dj who is spinning other people's recorded sounds can pull
$1,500 per show, two or three times a week, then a promoter should be able
to make at least that, after all, (s)he is the one who is creating
something out of nothing.

My point is this, why worrie about this now. YOU PAID THEIR SALARY!!
2 months ago, when I said these guys are shady , I got flamed and flamed.
Last Time:
Support promoters who you know support the scene!! There are quite a few in
the pb-cle area. You can tell who these promoters are by the quality of
there parties, and there dedication to throwning good parties.

I don't mind making a good hearted, loyal to the scene promoter rich,
someone who has been into the scene for a while, not some chump who saw a
party 8 months ago, asked their dad for a loan and threw a party without
any skill. Oh sorry , they did have one skill, the ability to copy every
other Cleveland party that ever happened !! And the not having skill part
showed , look at the lack of Flow the night presented! Anyone can get the
numbers of the sound and lighting Co's from legit parties, and find an
abused space, But to create a MAGICAL, MUSICAL FLOWING EVENT TAKES
SKILL!!!! And that what parties are all about, the total expirence, not
just 1 dj, or 1 live pa, or the lights, or the sound, Individually they are
nothing, IT IS A PACKAGE DEAL, ALL MUST COME TOGETHER AND "GEL" INTO A BIG
FAT "RAVE" (This only happens every so often, and it takes skill to
accomplish)

 making money on a party is not the worlds biggest sin, but feeling good
about making it is important. If a promoter makes $10,000 on a party, he
should feel like the people that went to the show got there moneys worth.
I have been to parties where I have paid $25 and been like wow, I got a
deal that was a great party, and then there are parties like G-spot where I
was comped at the door ( i did offer to pay,thank you very much), and still
feel like I got ripped off!!

This list spends so much time arguing about pants,people, clothes and crap
(hey I'm guilty as well) When, all this list should be talking about is how
our scene is going into the crapper. And what we can do to right the
situation. Cause it ain't going to change till we change it.

Someday I will be able to go to a "RAVE" again.....

see, thats a good sign, not a bad one.....it means people are so

choice to find some other way of choosing their leaders....which could 
lead to a socialist revolution....

Hmm . . . is this for real?  I don't see how these items could possibly
be this cheap.  do you know this stuff for real or are you just guessing?
 I'm especially in disbelief about the lasers.  I don't see how the
renting of tens of thousands of dollars worth of lasers plus a crew of
several to put them up, plus someone to run them throughout the night
could cost only $250.  I could be wrong, it just seems strange to me.  If
so, I may get ten people to pitch in with me and each of us pay ten bucks
to see a phat laser show in my house :)

This is in regards to the post about Greedo's missed shot, that someone said
was bullshit. I agree that I did not like the change to make it as if Han shot
greedo in self-defense, making him less of a cold-blooded killer. I liked Han's
style the old way better, but the whole project was overseen by George Lucas
himself, and he made the change. It was his creation in the first place, and he
is allowed to do whatever he damn well pleases. If it wasn't for him, we
wouldn't have Star Wars, and if he feels that the change makes the characters
more like he wanted, than so be it. 
just a few of my thoughts...

I've done several small parties(none anyone would recognize), and I these 
prices seem reasonable, if maybe a bit high.  I've got Empirical Sound's 
rental sheet here, so I can definately comment on these prices.

>>sound.................................................................$2,500
Seems high, though I don't know how much gear was at g.  50,000 Watts can be
rented for less than 500, eq and such are cheap, and Speakers aren't much 
either.  Of course, I'm assuming for all prices that the promoter/friends set
up, which I do but may not be accurate.  
>>lights.................................................................$1,500
For comparison, 8 Martin 218's are 260 to rent.  This isn't at all out of 
line, especially if you are paying someone to run the lights instead of 
setting up a sequence and letting it flow.  As I said, i do small parties.
>>lasers.................................................................$1,000
A 12 laser system is 360 for the weekend, plus setup is a bitch-takes a lot of
effort to set up laser chorus's right.  This is even more true if you do 
mirrors and other nifty tricks(see Whiskey Saigon in Toronto)

I think you were missing the 0 on the laser price.  My prices are definately 
for real, though I'm assuming that my crew does setup.  I routinely rent 10k
of equipment from Empirical for ~360 Sat-Mon.  
Course, I'm largely out of this business now, but...

    How do you figure? I'm still a little cloudy on how having more people
that care about the scene can make it fall apart. Please don't tell me we're

    Hey, if that's your opinion, I won't try to change it, but I've found
that, in general, the scene is what you make it. I don't really see raves any
more of a 'drug culture' or 'parental nightmare' than most high school parties
or rock concerts. My main drive in doing this project is to share the 'beauty
and real love and some fucking amazing music and some unique experiences' that
I've had. I agree that some people may try to 'hide' under the pretenses of
PLUR and whatnot, but be careful not to be so quick to judge as to who's doing
what.

    Agreed, and I intend to do just that.

   Sorry, but I can't really see the 'scene' as we know it becoming
comercialized and still existing. It's premise is based on anti-commericalism.
Anyway, I guess I really don't agree with your metaphorical 'fence' and
therefore can't really say which side I would be, eh, perching on. However, I
don't really see myself as falling into either of the one's you described.

    Thanks for your 'critique' there, Craig.

I think the song that's taken from is called "Another Classic".  Did you
hear anything that sounded like a door opening?  Was the classic sample
messed around with at all (effects etc)?

Hmmm . . . I saw ground zero play before, and he had soem nice selection
(definitely on the rap/b-boy tip), but his scratching was pretty ass.  He
kept scracthing on the record that was being played at the time, and it
just screwed the rhythm up. 

Oh well, I look forward to the performance regardless of who wins :)

Well, Steve, it sounds to me that you aren't allowing for new promoters by
definition.  How can someone acquire the "skills" without throwing
parties?  If we went by your strict rules -- supporting promoters who have
done it all before and have a reputation for quality -- there would only
be 3 promoters "allowed" to throw parties.  Given that there are 52 weeks
in a year, this is far too exclusive for me.

The original argument for this thread was that the producers of G-Spot
should have decreased the admission charge due to the fact that several 
of the main entertainers did not show to perform.  I disagree only if  
1)  the producers did not know prior to Saturday night that more than 
one "main draw" were no-shows and 2)  the number of pre-sale tickets 
purchased count was low.  Otherwise, $25 is not unreasonable considering 
the magnitude of the expenses involved in producing such a party.  Not 
only do the promotors have to front the money to cover the costs 
previously mentioned in this thread, which in my educated experience are 
a bit low (it costs a heck of a lot more than $1,500 to get a group like 
Cirrus from LA to Cleveland, travel, hotel, food, equipment, drink, 
etc.) , other expenses such as misc equipment, local permits, security, 
staff, site cleanup, porta-potty rentals do factor into the grand total. 
Whether or not the party was a bomb or dud, bills still need paid.  I 
agree with Sleepy's point that quality party producers should produce 
because the enjoy doing so and oughta put party profits back into the 
event or events in the future.  However, if party promotion is the sole 
gig of a producer then he most definitely ought to keep a SMALL portion 
of the profits for himself.  Continue to support the quality producers 
of our town such as Sherwood, Sleepy, Brian, Kidd (forgive me if I 
missed others) and attend their parties.  The "shady" productions will 
cease quickly.

Buzz in Washington, DC -- important update:

Just so everybody knows:

There is a new security team in place at Buzz and the Capitol Ballroom. 
 There is also new management at the Ballroom, who are much more 
raver-oriented.

Still under no conditions will drug dealing be taken lightly.  If caught, 
you will be treated with courteous, professional attitudes when escorted out 
the door.  Should you experience security mistreatment for ANY reason, 
immediately tell Scott, Lieven or Leilani, Buzz' new manager.  She will be 
the liaison b/w the Ballroom management and Buzz when Scott and Lieven 
aren't available.  She's cool, so make sure you say hi!

Scott and Lieven were aware of the problems with security.  They've met with 
the new security team and let them know that bad attitudes toward ravers 
will not be tolerated.  Future meeting are scheduled so Scott and Lieven can 
get updates on any problems security finds with the crowd, or to address any 
complaints ravers have with security.

There are a few familiar security staffers who chose to stay at the Ballroom 
after the management change.  Buzz does not foresee any future problems with 
them.  Again, if this is not the case, you need to let Scott, Lieven or 
Leilani know.

It's been a long time coming, but it really took a new manager at the 
Ballroom for the problems to be fixed.  I know the Buzz crew is sorry for 
any bad experiences caused by unprofessional Ballroom staff.  But things are 
changing for the better.

ALSO:

The lot next door to Buzz has been fitted with extra lights and covered in 
gravel with 2 uniformed parking attendants on duty all-night.  In 
March/April the people who installed Fever's infamous sound system will 
upgrade the system at Buzz.

AND at BUZZ/STING/SUPERSTING 2 this spring:

Roni Size/Reprazent (9 - person ensemble performing live!!!), Paul 
Oakenfold, Fatboy Slim and Mrs. Wood are a few of the international talent 
to stop by at Buzz.

'98 is gonna be great.....

really? i don't think i've seen him do that before, maybe he's just gotten
better since then. both him + rob usually spin all jump up + hardstep.
they've been playing that technology track a lot in the last couple of
months, that's the only one that i remember off hand.

Ok..the way I look at it is this..For me anyways, this was one of the 
better parties I've been to in cleveland, and I had a *really* great 
time, regardless of whether 2 headliners didn't show, yadda yadda 
yadda...I could have spend like 12 bux goin to a 2 hour movie (cost 
of movie and munchies!), I coulda spent around 25 and went to a 
concert for a few hours, but instead I spent 25 bux, listened to some 
incredible music for 13+ hours, met some awesome people...I dunno, I 
don't regret it..maybe it's just me...

i think what he means is there's all these fly-by-night promoters you've
never heard of who suddenly appear promising this big lineup for a big
price party, while tons of shade is surrounding the whole affair, rumors
are flying, you never hear anything for sure about it, especially from the
promoters, then if the party actually goes off, it's more by accident than
as a result of experience and logical planning. so what i think is the
best solution for new promoters is to start very small to get experience,
and learn as much as possible from other promoters + other parties about
what you can do to plan a quality event that is sure to be worth the money
people are paying to get into it. then you can work your way up to
bigger events. consistently good promoting is not by accident, but it is
the result of much experience and much learning, in addition to the
careful planning and hard work.

I agree with you Chris. All this complaining is making me sick.
Especially the guy who got in for free and still felt 'ripped off.' Maybe
spoiled a bit. Come on people! But hey, that's just me....

First off, I'd like to give a big shout out to all of the lists that are
receiving this. I apologize for the massive cross post, but this will
only be a one time thing and I think it's something that could
definitely help a lot of us.

    Ok, here's the deal. I'm posting this in search of a team (myself
plus two other people) for an internet scholarship I'm entering. The
basic idea behind the contest is to get together with other students to
create a series of web pages which successfully educate other students
and teachers on a certain topic. Based on my personal experiences, most
of my friends and others I talk to really have no idea whatsoever as to
what's involved in the rave/party scene at all. Now, by no means am I an
expert, but I think it would be a very worthwhile project for a few of
us to get together, share what we have learned, and, possibly, give some
people a look at something that we all love that they otherwise might
not get the chance to experience. I have hundreds of ideas for content,
etc, etc. but right now, I need to get a team application finalized no
later than February 28th. (next Sat!)  If you are AT ALL interested,
please email me by the end of this week, Feb 22nd, (this Sunday!) at
spike@nb.net with something to the effect of 'Rave Team' in the subject.
I'll need some time to sort everything out. In your message, please
include some general info about yourself, (who you are, where you're
from, etc, etc), some rave/party-specific info (what you feel you can
offer to the team, what it's meant to you), and if you have any HTML
editing or artistic talent. Please don't think I'll be sitting here with
a checklist crossing people off because they didn't 'make the cut' or
anything like that, I'm just trying to get an idea of who I'll be
dealing with and what they have to contribute.

    Anyway, I hope that a few of you out there will share in my 'vision'
and will want to work with me on this. If you decide to do this, please
know in advance that it will probably mean several hours of work per
week on your part. At the same time, the rewards can be worth it. (First
Prize is $25,000 per member  :>  plus the satisfaction of seeing your
page internationally recognized, etc, etc...) I'm not trying to scare
anyone off, I just don't want anybody to get committed to this and then
not have the time to follow through it making it work.

    Again, my apologies for the cross-posting, but I hope this ends up
helping a few of you out there. I look forward to hearing from anyone
interested.

    peace,

Ugh!  No way, dude!  Whatever happened to originality?  Knock-offs of some
fashion labels are lame-ass!  Unless it's really derogatory, I refuse to

If anything, the rave culture is a godsave.  I don't know about you, but
in my high school, parties were most often fall-down-drunk affairs and
waste-yourself-on-pot ordeals.  As a result, many of my friends were cited
for underage drinking, losing their licenses until they were either 18 or
21.  Later on, I found that some of my high school acquaintances had
received DUIs.  Rock concerts, BTW, fall into the same category.  I think
that Ravers, FOR THE MOST PART, are responsible drug users.  They more
often than not, know what they're getting into.  And anyway, PLUR is
better than let's-go-mosh-to-Better than
Ezra-and-get-the-shit-knocked-out-of-us-by-some-drunken-wanna-be-frat-boy,
don't you think?

I will.  I realize that being "underground" affords us the luxury of
non-conformity.  I've liked being underground, but nothing lasts forever.
Every form of music was, at one time, underground.  I do feel sad that
we're becoming more and more mainstreamed but it there is SOME good in it.
For example, good producers are making some money on their music by 
signing labels, working for advertising agencies, as well as working on
soundtracks to movies and tv shows.  We may not like their work, but then
again, we don't like every producer to come out.  There is a noticable
cycle to this phenomenon.  It's happened with what we NOW call
Rock'n'Roll, Disco, Hip hop, Rap, Grunge, Ska, Punk, etc.  I won't say
that mainstreaming is good, wonderful, the best thing that could ever
happen to us.  It's just inevitable. :(

I agree most of these knock-offs are lame because they look too-much like
the lame clothing they are mocking, but once I saw a really cool shirt.
This kid just took a regular Hilfiger shirt and wrote "sucks" under the
logo. That's genius to me. ;P

Actually, I wish there were more good knock offs of products/ideas these
days...the generic fashion of a few years ago with all the knock-offs was
way more interesting than the 'real' generic fashion of today.  I'd take
just about anything if people got past the Hilfiger/Designer/Camo (i think
we're finally out of the last one) phase.

Thank you for translating! I'm a musician/dj with terrible typing skills,
my mind works really fast and my hands can't keep up, so my babble usually

But that's exactly the point!  If the scene becomes commercial it WON'T 
exist.  And, commercialization follows wherever there is money to be 
made; i.e. wherever there are a lot of people to which to sell 
something.  Thus, the larger the scene gets, the more people there will 
be to which to sell and the more commercial the scene will become.

I for one would like to see the scene more commercialized here in
pittsburgh.  Damnit, I can't even buy a decent pair of big pants here (if
anyone knows a good store, clue me in).  Back home (seattle), we have a
bunch of stores that cater almost entirely to ravers and it seems like a
good thing to me.  I agree that underground stuff is usually the best but
that doesn't mean ravers can't survive a bit of commercialization.  I'll
usually go to the smaller parties because the vibe is tight and the price
is right but I still pop in my chem. bros cd occasionaly and jnco don't
seem all that satanic to me.

As for G-Spot, all of you quit your whining!  It is one thing to say that
the party sucked and the promoter charged to much, but you can't blame the
promoter too much.  Most promoters aren't ravers they are business men.
Shadiness is there bussiness.  The secret is to find a few promoters
you like (ahem, House of Styles) and go to every damn party they put
on.  There is nothing wrong with making a profit.  If you had a rotten
time you should feel like a dumbass for a few days and then vow to never
go to another party promoted by that dude.  And keep posting reviews!
This list is the best weapon against shady promoters!

I agree wholehartedly, The more people into raves, the more commercialized
it will get yes, but also you'll get more raves... I'd rather have a rave
every weekend then 6 a year that are "underground"... In short even if the
scene does get commercialized, the party's STILL what you make of it.

>As for G-Spot, all of you quit your whining!  It is one thing to say that

Heh I dont think it sucked... I had a great time... Alot of people seemed to
have a good time. I wouldnt rate it anything close to Biz, mainly cause Biz
was so smooth, but I think it was worth the $25 bucks.

It's annoying to listen to 2 or 3 people over and over tell you how shady a
promoter is... "he's shady" but then dont mention specifics... It seems like
a few people have some sort of vendetta against this promoter. It's annoying
to hear generalizations / gut feelings over and over and over again with
nothing to back it up. The only "factual" information I've seen posted
against this promoter/event was that the party was at peabodys, and that
turned out to be a bullshit rumor. If you want to try to influence me, tell
me the facts and let me decide the adjectives to apply. That having been
said, the 2 things I found shady were that there was no security, and 2
headliners didnt show. And from what I understand that can happen to any
party? It wasnt that major tho cause I'm sure that %99 of the people (me
included) would have went even if those headliners weren't even scheduled.
The lack of security I find somewhat irresponsible. I've been in bars that
didnt have bouncers/security, seen 2 people start fighting and have it
escalate to everyone in the place fighting in a matter of minutes... even
one or 2 security personnel can make a huge difference if some asshole with
an urge to fight rears his ugly head.

>Shadiness is there bussiness.  The secret is to find a few promoters

Yeah Biz was the shit :) Can't wait till they do another. Only prob is the
Irish center was so packed, and I'm guessing that seeing as how so many
people liked it that more people would show up at thier next event, and that
mebby if they do it at the Irish center again, it might be insane (hell BIZ
was insanely packed for a few hours, I couldnt move much less dance from
like 2-4).

Again, with the cycles!  Sometimes we're naughty and sometimes we're nice,
get used to it.  I think many of us are feeling a bit cranky, right now.

I think that's different.  I mean, I could be wrong, but I don't think 
Tommy Hilfiger and company sit around planning marketing stratagies to 
sell to ravers.  I think ravers started buying designer clothes on their 
own.  The "commercialization" I'm talking about doesn't necessarily have 
much to do with Warhol-esque idea or ravers espousing the aesthetic 
value of pop culture, it has more to do with the idea of large money 
interests looking to exploit the scene.

i think that tommy hilfiger and the like are exploiting youth in general 
by trying to appeal to their tastes....i saw a hilfiger jacket that was 
made from hologram material.....i think that in particular catered to 
ravers.....the price???? $375......

sup everybody?

i've got a solution to the netmeet problem (cuz like most of you out
there, i've never actually met anyone @ one).

SOMEONE BRING A BIG PIECE OF POSTERBOARD AND WRITE "NET MEET" ON IT,
AND STAND RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT

that should get things underway. now all you need is a rave, time and
place.

I see yer point Dan, and I agree to an extent - there does need to be a
point where promoters don't just throw a few parties, then loose all their
money on one that didn't come together and give up.  That sucks, and I'v
seen it happen more than a few times here in Pittsburgh.

BUT (yeah, you know I likes the booty), can't we have our cake and eat it
too?  Take you'r comparison of BIZ and G-Spot.  I don't think there was
any controvercy about the overall enjoyment of BIZ.  All the djs showed.
Security was good but not invasive.  $15.  G-Spot.  Security not existant.
A couple headliners no-shows.  No overal agreement on the enjoyment.  $25.
And to top it off, the G-Spot crew made ~$20k for the thing (according to
estimates), while a know for a fact that BIZ made only a few thousand
(less than 5k for sure).  

I have nothing against the G-Spot crew, and I know noone can control every
factor absolutely. But throwing parties where you charge alot, and skimp
on security and djs (without giving back some loot for the no-shows), it
at least gives the impression of shadyness.

To me, this is a big issue.  I don't mind seeing the rave scene getting
big, I love it - i just don't want it to get big AND greedy and lame.

Just a shout to everyone on this list - I appriciate everyone's

only can come from understanding each other and our differences.  MUCH

I have to disagree with this post on the Hilfiger comp.. This company is
interested in the big market, the mass population, the MTV generation of kids.
Although the MTV generation might be one in the same with ravers. The rave
scene is so small in comparison that Hilfiger could give a shit less about
them, they want the mass number of people to buy their shit. It's just that
raver kids are becoming part of that mass, and are liking the shit that
Hilfiger is producing. So basically what it looks like is that the scene is
becoming commercialized, and that raves and ravers, are no longer going to
belong to a sub-culture, but belong to that Mass pop. I think this all spawnss
from MTV, come on, they have techno and other "electronica" on there now! Some
time or another the scene will be commercialized, it's on it's way, and kids
just don't want to admit it, or just do see it. What it comes down to is MTV!
MTV has managed to ruin pop music as it is. It has become a battle of good
marketing instead of good music.

My friends tried this they promoted the hell out of the party for a long

lost money so I dont think this works very often these days.

     I think the point is that big inevitably equals greedy and lame.  
"Big" equals "greedy" is no secret.  That's how business works.  "Big" 
equals "lame" is a bit more subtle.  Well, maybe think of it this way: 
"cheesy", in part, can be defined as overuse, the hackneying of 
something.  And its not too hard to see that "big" means more and more 
use.

I wouldn't place all the blame on MTV.  Pop music has always been more

I would like to say a few things about some of the stuff that has been
said on this list over the past week.


On one hand, everyone needs to realize that the rave scene has already
become commercialized. Just because we do not predominantly buy and sell
our tickets through ticketmaster and just because raves are not advertised
on television and on the radio (although some may be) does not mean that
commercialization does not exist. The rave culture in and of itself has
already become a consumerist culture. Most of us, prior to even entering
into the rave scene, are already steeped in our consumerist, capitalist
ways. Living in America, I do not think there is anyway around this. So
lets be honest when we talk about the rave scene. It already has been
reduced to capital. We are paying a price for a _product_. Whether you
prefer to believe that product is the music, the experience, the drug
the space to hang out with your friends, the vibe, whatever..you are still
PAYING for it. And for that simple reason, because it is highly unusual
for a dj, a sound company, a promoter, a drug dealer, the light company,
the record companies, the vendors, the space owners, the city (who sells
the permits) to offer their services for FREE, we are ultimately at a very
basic level CONSUMERS. It is impossible to talk about the rave scene
without admitting this,  because no matter how hard anyone is going to try
to convince me that its all about the music, its all about the vibe, its
all about the drugs, its all about ----whatever----, what it all boils
down to is MONEY. And because we are consumers, and because money is what
ultimately gives concrete action to the abstract desires and wishes for
anyone to throw a party, we have to use this to our advantage. I agree
with all of those people on this list who are proponents that we have to
use our money to make a statement. Lets put our money where our mouth
are: Dont support crap. 

Furthermore, a few days ago someone mentioned something about teaching
people what the rave scene is about, and Craig commented that if the truth
be told that we should just fess up to the fact that the rave scene is
just a big parental nightmare. Or something to that effect. (Excuse 
me, I don't have it in front of me.._)
Someone
rebutted by saying that they have seen more drugs at concerts, at
highschool parties, etc. That excuse is so old. I know because when I
first started raving, I used it too. Whenever I would see those 20/20
specials or Dateline, or whatever, I would use those same excuses to stand
up for the rave scene and say, well tehy didnt show the GOOD side of
raving! They didnt present raving in the right light. That was a biased
representation...blah blah blah. But the longer I am in this scene, the
more my defenses are broken down until I am able in all honesty to say
that you know what, those news reports are right. While there is a good
side to raving, while there are people who care about the music and about
the love and about the PLUR (insert whatever in here), in the end, I think
it is absolutely ridiculous and absurd to say that there are more drugs at
highschool parties and at concerts than at raves. HELLO wake up. Where
else can you go to find all of the major drugs? Going to a rave is like
walking into a drug supermarket. And maybe I have been out of highschool
too long (and trust me it isnt very long!),  but I think it is safe to
assume that there is a considerably higher prevalence of drug use at a
rave than in any other large, commercial, youth gathering. 

I know a lot of you who read this are going to be offended and defensive
about my opinion, but what I am really asking is that everyone put down
their defenses and look at the real, concrete reality of the rave scene: a
scene that revolves around money and drugs just as much (if not more) than
it has to do with music. This is a scary thought to me. The longer I go to
raves, the more apparent this becomes. In the beginning, I had the same
idealistic views about what raves were about and what they had the
potential to be, but now, I dont know. I used to think that when (and if)
I ever became a parent, I would let my kid go to raves (or whatever the
temporal equivalent would be), I would be open-minded, I would understand
that no they werent the one doing all the drugs, it was just other kids
making *those* kinds of decisions. But now when I think about it, I
understand why it is a nightmare to many parents, and sometimes I myself
do not want to be a part of it, sometimes I want to steer myself as far
away from the dark side of the scene as possible: the side that slowly
seems to be eclipsing everything and anything else in its path. It is at
these times that I think what a nightmare this would be as a parent, and
god forbid that I would want my child to be a part of it.

So thats my more-than-two cents. Be gentle,

Kate

i have some shady promoter FACTS to mention. i don't think i said this
before...
in november or december nick from "badass productions" (what kind of a
name is that anyway?) offered to pay me $20 to rent my turntables & mixer
(1200s & an admittedly crappy mixer, but its sound was ok. now i have a
much better mixer). so i brought it all over + set it up + stupidly
trusted him when he said he could pay me when it was over. but at the end
of the night he said he couldn't pay me any of the money and wouldn't even
give me an explanation. so when i got a flyer for the next party which was
we can't be stopped, i called the infoline and it hadn't been updated, but
it said they lost their space at the agra delhi "because of some
bullshit". saying that of course doesn't do anything to help their
reputation. so i left a message saying i would please like to be  
guestlisted since you owe me $20 the party costs $10 and you can guestlist
me for the next one that is $10 or less and we can call it even. of course
i didn't get any reply. so i got in carrying some lights + helped with all
the wiring and i gave a tape to nick too. but i don't trust him + i plan
on getting into any more parties he throws for free since he dicked me
over and doesn't deserve my money when he STILL owes ME money.

What I said: was there is more alcoholism and marijuana use at high school
functions.  There is definitely more alcohol at a high school party
than at a rave!  Honestly, I perceive alcohol as an extremely
dangerous drug for various reasons that I will not go into at this time.  =
=20
Often, the harder chemical drugs aren't really all the
prevelant in these circles.  Perhaps you have been out of school too long,
or maybe it just wasn't a problem in your school.  There are drugs in
every scene (yes, alcohol is a drug).  I think the reports are VERY biased
when it comes to raves.  You may have noticed the 20/20 report only
interviewed under-age, heavy drug users.  They didn't talk to anyone over
18.  They didn't talk to any straight-edge ravers (and there are a lot out
there).  They didn't include PLUR philosophies.  These reports are made to
be biased.  They are intentionally one-sided in order to get the public's
attention, and in turn, high ratings.  Consumerism, people!=20

At one point in my raving life, I felt disillusioned.  Everywhere I
turned, I felt as if I was surrounded by shadiness.  Everyone was a dealer
and everyone was a user and I felt alone because I was the only one not
using.  I think I was just lonely.  Just ignore everything I've just said
if you don't agree with me because I don't want to try and change your
mind.  The scene is what you make of it and if it seems to you like it's
time to get out, then it's time.  It's okay to bail.  If it's going well
for you and you love it and you see nothing wrong, more power to you.
I would like to say, however, I've seen many an old raver burn out and
move on with their life (that is, old in years raving, not old in birth
years).  This scene seems to suck everything out of some people and leave
them bitter.  Be careful. =20

     Yeah?  Then what are songs on the radio?  Appearances on Ed

     So MTV has come to dominate the music market.  That doesn't mean 
pop music is any different from when OTHER things dominated the market 
i.e. radio.   
     Plus, in general, I don't think it's right to blame an influencER

for themselves.

I'm glad soemone finaly had the balls to say this, cause its true.  I am
currently in highschool and it is true.  Before I went to raves I had
access to drugs, although it was definitely limited.  When I first went
to a rave and somebody offered me E and crystal in the same sentence I
was fucking blown away.  "What is this?  An abundance of drugs?  Damn,
that's a first."  And it is true that there are way too many drugs at
raves, often times up to dangerous levels.  They used to tell us in DARE
that most people start off doing small drugs and work there way up to
hard core drugs before they knew it.  And I have seen this happen to
people.  the figure "well if I'm dropping acid, then why not snort a line
of crystal? . . . . If I'm snorting a line of crystal, why not make it
coke? . . . if I'm snorting a line of coke why not freebass it?" etc etc.

Sure when I started going  (and even today) I say, "Oh yeah there are
people that do that, but its not very prevelant"  But that's a load of
shit, and just about anyone that has gone to a rave knows that.

OK, I've tried to stay out of this entire comemrcialization conversation,
but I've got to say some shit in response to this message.  Everybody
thinks: "Oh no! Commercialization!!!  NOOOO!!" But in many ways it isn't
a bad thing.  A good example is the punk scene.  At first it started out
as a small underground group with people doing their own thing and not
caring about anything else, and then after a while the media caught on,
and tried to popularize it, with a fair amount of success.  This happened
because it was something new and something to catch people's attention. 
After a while the media went on with their mainstream bullshit, but with
a punk influence.  And after all that shit happened, the punk scene, some
would say, just grew stronger from it.  Sure you are going to get some
mainstream people and "posers" in the mix, but that is going to happen
regardless.  So that is basicaly what happened to techno.  The media (MTV
as Bri@n says) caught on to something new and different, and tried to
make some money.  you can't blame people for doing this, and you can't
expect people not to do it.  Techno has been blown up by the media in
England and look where they have got beacuse of it.  Raves packed with
incredible acts and thousands of people every weekend.  There are happy
hardcore albums at the top of the pop charts in England.  Ravers will
always have a sub-culture regardless of over commercialization.  Another
close example is hip-hop.  Sure people like Puff Daddy have taken the
popularity of hip-hop and decided to make millions of dollars on it, but
there is still that hardcore subculture of true hip-hop that can't be
destroyed by money hungry people like him.

I think ravers need to stop being so elitist (not that I'm saying I don't
act this way as well).  In order to have a good thing, it doesn't have to
be hidden from everybody else.  Fuck everybody else, keep the spirit
alive yourself.

ABSOLUT

PS-Regardling Hillfiger and allt hat other shit, much of it is purchased
by ravers because of the fact that many of the designs cater to the rave
scene.  Reflective clothing, skilled design (think about how much rave
flyers are stressed and the design put into them compared to the design
and style put into much of that style of clothing.

	Originally, Mtv was all music, all the time (remember that ad?).  
The radio and Ed Sullivan are entertainment.  Radio stations have to keep
a play list because they have to pay royalties when they play the songs.
In the 50's, managers would pay stations to play their artists' songs.
This was called payola (weird word, I know) and was & is illegal.  Ed
Sullivan and other variety/talk shows pay their guests to appear.  As far
as artist-dedicated web pages go, I think those are sponsered by the group
or their label or maybe a really dedicated fan, I just don't know.

I didn't know you held Mtv so close to your heart.  Mtv doesn't dominate
the market anyways.  In other countries (oh my god, you mean the US
isn't the center of the universe?!) there is another music channel called
MuchMusic.  It's based in Toronto with branches in the US called MuchUSA,
in Argentina called MuchArgentina, and in Finland called MuchJyrki.  You
can get MuchUSA through satellite.  You can visit their web site at, what
else, www.muchmusic.com (big surprise).  

> p.s. I don't really appreciate your brash treatment of my opinion.

Um, sorry?  I didn't mean to abraid.  I thought everyone knew about Mtv.

I feel I'm becoming very close to that point...Even if I have a great 
time at a party, there's always this kinda "darkness" right 
underneath it all...I felt alone at Gspot, cuz all the peeps I went 
with were using this and that, and 90% of the people I talked to 
asked me if I wanted this or that, or knew where they could get 
it...I think raving really does take alot out of you..Getting zero 
sleep every weekend can certainly do that...I don't know that I've 
become bitter per se, but I do get a bit annoyed sometimes, and I've 
seen my perspective on many aspects of the whole scene change many 
times over...I just don't know anymore...I think I'll mostly stick to 
local clubnights and maybe a party here and there depending on the 
lineup...I'll definatly be at pleasure for john aqcuiviva tho!

Hmm, you can get MuchMusic on normal cable in Cleveland..I believe 
107.9 even does a broadcast thingie in colaboration with them...They 
have this kinda cheesey show called Electric Circus, kinda like The 
Grind on MTV, except they play OK music now and then, and you get to 
see a DJ spin :)

Well, that's an intelligent answer to a perfectly innocent and logical
question.  So much for promoting knowledge.
By the way, that's a literary device called SARCASM.

ok, so this is going to seem real hard to some people.
basically, I think that kids can probably make their own decisions about
drugs. we all get that "dare education", we all learn about the dangers
of drugs. if one chooses then to take drugs and it fucks their shit up,
they have only themselves to blame. I'm real sick and tired of america's
"childproof" society and fucking warning labels on everything. illegal
drugs are illegal, and thus unregulated, so clearly one should be
careful when dealing with them. I think people need to be responsible
for their actions and realize that there are consequences for everything.
Is raver drug use responsible? I'd have to say that it mostly is.
considering the sheer amount of drugs that people take, there are
suprisingly few problems. parents worry, the media worries. that's what
they do. but they also don't see the whole picture.
anyway, I don't think that it's a part of the scene that's going to go
away. but if people are more informed, they'll be able to make better
choices.

ok stinky.  i thought it was onomatopoeia.

    Please refer to the "Correct Communication of Inflection over a

append "/s" to the end of the statement so as to obliterate confusion.  This
is your first notice, a second warning will activate the auto genetic

What do we all think about the bioweapons and the war + on, in the mid east?
I am in conflict, [17yr oldes always are], my brain is saying "do not kill
anyone - please do not use, or prompt another nation to use nuclear or
biologic warfare".  if this sphere was run on happiness (not
$$$$$$$$.$$$).....oh, will that ever happen?

The thing that makes MTV different than the radio, is the fact that you can see
what the artists look like instead of hearing what they sound like. Take the
band Bush for instance. They came about after the whole "Seattle" ordeal, having
the same sound as Pearl Jam, Nirvana, etc, but were cleaner, more appealing,
and better looking, so they hit it big. In comparison, their music was crap,
not that PJ or Nirv. was much better, but they had a point to their music,
unlike Bush, which was to sell albums, and feed off of the general public.

If you're interested in this conflict you definitly outta check out a book
by William Blum called 'Killing Hope'.  There's no better way to get a
better perspective on the present than by learning about what we've done
in the Gulf in the past.  This book will literally make you angry.

You Know You're a Star Wars Geek When...

You start a posse with all your friends and call yourselves the Rebel
Alliance.
Your goal in life is to destroy the Death Star and save the universe.
You're reading this while in your Star Wars under-wear.
You go into bars expecting to find a whole assortment of aliens and creatures.
You know more about the history of Dagobah then you do about Earth.
Your only dis is "I could have been your father but Chewbacca beat me up the
stairs."
You started crying when your mom told you that Yoda wasn't real.
You go into the pet store and ask if they sell tauntauns.
You name your trashcan R2-D2.
You keep watching the film over and over and over again just to make sure you
didn't miss anything.
You can recite the whole Star Wars trilogy script backwards.
You get drunk one night and you DO recite the whole Star Wars trilogy script
backwards!
You constantly ask your friends to join the dark side.
You have already reserved your seat for the next Star Wars movie.
You cry when the Ewoks die in Return of the Jedi.
You try to impress girls by doing your Chewbacca imitation.
You wake up hung over and you think it's because of the effects of carbonite
freezing.
Your best pick-up line is "Hey baby, wanna see my light saber?"
You look in the yellow pages to see if a Jedi training center really does
exist.
You join the military in hopes of using Imperial blasters.
You get mad when you see Chewbacca misspelled.
You wonder why the "authentic light saber" you bought for 400 dollars doesn't
work.
You don't understand why Hitler didn't make a death star.
You become a linguistic major in the hopes of one-day being fluent in over 6
million forms of communication.
You constantly correct people on their Star Wars literacy.
When you complain that Spaceballs was a mockery of society.
Your idea of a good time is watching the trilogy with the sound off, reciting
the lines by heart.
You are reading this, and to your horror, find that you can identify with most
of the things listed.
You call your enemies "Rebel scum."
You wake up in the morning and make sure you're right hand is still there.
Your walls a covered with nude pictures of Princess Leia.
Your walls a covered with nude pictures of Obi Wan Kenobi.
You write alternative scripts to the trilogy because, in your opinion,
"Chewbacca would never say that."
You embroider Corellian blood-stripes on your blue jeans, alter and mangle a
perfectly good leather belt, and then wear the items to bars in the hope that
someone might try to hire you and your ship.
Not only can you recite every word along with the trilogy, you can accurately
replicate every beep and whistle made by R2-D2.
Nobody, but nobody confuses Star Wars and Star Trek in your presence and lives
to tell about it.
You think you next door neighbor works for Jabba the Hutt.
For one brief moment you nurture the hope that there might actually be naked
Princess Leia posters.
You made numerous attempts on Mel Brooks' life after SpaceBalls was made.
You play the soundtrack during your wedding ceremony
You continuously check your local record store for the latest from the Max
Rebo Band.
You get pulled over by a cop and tell him "you don't need to see my
identification."
You insist your dog is a wookie co-pilot and let him sit in the passenger seat
while everyone else is crammed in the back.
You've bought eighteen copies of the trilogy just in case you lose one.
You pretend your cat's sandbox is the Saarlac Pit and shove G.I. Joes in it.
You search for remains of Alderaan in your backyard
When you cut open your dog and try to stick your best friend inside to keep
him warm.
You make the Kessal Run in less than twelve parsecs
You swear revenge on the deaths of all Ewoks.
You sit for hours trying to figure out some other dumb ending to the phrase
"You know you're a Star Wars geek when..."
When you put your Solo and Princess Leia figures in erotic positions.
Whenever you go out with your friends, you walk single file to hide your
numbers.
You have copied the movies on to cassette tapes and listen to them in the car.
You use a Star Wars quote to get you out of every sticky situation you come
into.
Your action figures are in better shape than you are.
You get the full figure cut out of Luke Skywalker and have him as your best
man in your wedding.
When your mom finds you curled up in a blanket saying, "Red Five, Standing
by."
You can't sleep because you're afraid of the Darth Vader cut out in the corner
of your room
You spend hours at the dinner table constructing a Death Star made of mashed
potatoes.

You know, nobody forces anyone to do any drug. It's up to everyoneto educate
themselves about drugs and then decide whether they want to
do them. Raves just happen to be a place where the normal societal rules
don't apply to drug use. If you want them, they are there. If not, you don't
have to do them.

As I said above, if you know what you are getting into, it's your
choicewhether to do drugs or not. As for DARE, did anyone else notice that
among the police officers that got busted in Cleveland last month was
at least one DARE officer? So much for keeping kids off drugs.

So what? Nobody makes you do them.

obviously not going to stop being a dickhead.  even though this is all 
because of capitalism, i think saddam will fall before capitalism.

> 
Okay, I see what you're saying, and I agree that this is a valid point.  I have
gone over again and again in my head about whether or not I would be totally 
carefree and okay about my kids going to raves and using drugs, whatever.  When 
I take my little brother with me to parties our mom knows, and she knows we 
have fun -- and she has no clue that drugs may possibly be involved in our 
night.  She knows that drugs are readily available, but is constantly assured 
that we are in a safe environment and that we, indeed, are not using them.  I
also know that when I was in high school I used to come home bleeding, bruised,
and with bumps on my head from Nine Inch Nails concerts, and that every time I
went to another concert she would sit home and be terribly worried about me.  I
guess after I'd thought it over, I've decided that I would rather my kid be at
a rave all night than get the shit kicked out of them in a mosh pit, drink
themselves into some dangerous, liver-damaging alcohol poisoning, possibly get
into a car with a drunk driver, or just be driving around at night with other
drunk drivers on the road.  
 
Just a quick point about the drug use in general:
If you shoot up regularly, you're a dumbass, and you're probably not doing this
because of the rave scene anyway.  Coke and meth -- everyone knows that they
have potential to be abused, but although I see some of this at raves I'd still
say these aren't the norm for most party-goers.  So what's left?  Ecstasy,
acid, and ketamine, which are non-addictive, and are *virtually* physically 
harm free  (especially when compared to the world's most abused and socially 
harmful drug, alcohol).  I'm not saying these are totally "safe" or anything
like that; I'm not advocating their use in any way -- I'm just saying that if I
must someday, as a parent, have to choose between 'two evils,' I would rather
my kids be raving, not puking and passing out at a high school party without any
supervision.  I will also say that I think people tend to be more responsible
with their illicit drug use than their legal drug use, because many people
assume that just because something's legal, it must not be bad for you, and so
they throw caution to the wind and go hog wild. There,that's my major point.  

I do think the media in general blows up all that's bad about raves.  Maybe a
couple kids every year forget to drink water and dance for too long, then die
from dehydration.  Maybe someone accidentally snorts smack instead of ketamine
and dies.  These incidents are tragic when they happen, but this is the kind of
thing that gets focused on in the media.  Every year hundreds of kids get
killed on prom night in drunken car accidents and what have you, and although 
their stories are just as tragic -- it's like it's just become expected on some 
level, just like we can expect to see all the blood and gore and tragedy of a 
horror movie every night on the 6 o'clock news.  Just something to think about, 
I guess.
 
Signing off, Amanda

A rubber band attached to a sounding board?

Sorry.  I think he meant 'freebase', which is roughly akin to making your
own fcrack, i.e., cooking the impurities out of it.

Are you out of your fuxking mind!!!! Are you personally this stupid, or is
the whole rave scene moved so far down the slide of drug abuse that to

all of my friends to shoot up anything EVER is fucking stupid. IT"S JUST
NOT EXCEPTABLE, EVER!! Shit I double check the vial when I go to a doctor
and get a shot!
If you have never seen someone close to you die, or Od from shooting some
crazy shit, watch train spotting, or some other movie.. maby that will
change your "regularly" to a big bold "if you shoot up EVER, your a fuxking
moron!"

Also, "so what's left".... How about being sober... I'm not preaching, but
you did forget that as an option. Remember parties are about the music?...

Calm The Fuck Down.  

First, I am most definitely Not Stupid.

Second -- Yes, I agree, using heroine Ever is bad bad bad.  I'm sorry I did not
make that clear.  Guess I was typing too fast.

Third -- When I said, 'what's left,' I was referring to What Drugs Are Left,
not what options for personal choice are left.  I wasn't even slightly talking
about the tons of people who choose never to put drugs into their systems, at
raves or anywhere else.  If one chooses never to use drugs, more power to them. 
If one chooses to do research on the drugs one plans on doing, and then uses
them responsibly -- more power to them too.

Maybe by the end of the day or something I will have cleared up everyone's
misinterpretaions of what I was TRYING to say.

Dude, I think you missed the whole point of her message. I would think thatthe word
'Regularly' used in this context was sarcastic. Did you even bother
to read the rest of it? Chill out.

Being sober is always an option. As for overdosing, if someone is stupidenough to be
shooting up anything, that's a chance you take. Don't go
mountain climbing if you don't like the possibility of falling.

I think we're beginning to reach an impasse here.  If I may, I'd
like to suggest a possible tangental way of approaching this.

Let's hear from different people and see what their definitions are
for the following:


	1)  "responsible" drug use

	2)  at what age would you generally consider someone
	    "responsible" enough to make their own decisions
	    regarding drug use

	3)  what drugs are "okay" and why

	4)  what methods of chemical administration are "okay"
	    and why


The reason I bring these points up is that I repeatedly see the same
sorts of messages on these mailing lists and the same sorts of
discussions amongst my friends.  "So-and-so is a loser because they
do [insert drug]" (but it's okay that they themselves do [insert
drug]).  "So-and-so is a crackhead because they [eat/drink/smoke/
inject/whatever] [insert drug]" (but it's okay that they themselves
[eat/drink/smoke/inject/whatever] the same drug).  Or "so-and-so is
too young to be doing [blank]" (yet they themselves do [blank]).

Just as it's hard to listen to an adult who smokes and drinks tell
us about the horror of drugs like pot and E, it's equally
hypocritical for those of us who do those drugs to turn around and
say things like meth or heroin are equally empirically evil.  'cause
they're not.  It's all relative.

Get what I'm saying?

I find it's difficult to have any sort of meaningful discussion 
about something until everyone understands what everyone means.
Like some common reference points.  

Everyone raising their hand and giving their opinion is one thing.
But I think we'd all like a little more out of this.

What do you think?

Well... i do apologize for the 'John' slater error. whoops. I was in the
lab and threw something together as a pre-flyer last minute type thing and
I was just getting the notes from the top of my head. Plus that's just a
pre-flyer. No offence to john for that problem though. 
OTHER ACTS ARE CONFIRMED and locked down. I don't do the shady... 'put a
name on the flyer cause they'll come to here him and we'll bank out by
charging some rediculus price for the party thing.' FUCK THAT SHIT. 
I've been doing raves since '93 and I should hope that something like that
would never happen. But it does. So see ya @ terminal velocity.

AH Yeah......keepin' their heads ringin' huh Stickman!  It been awhile since
I've seen you.  I haven't been out and about lately....I'm doing my own
"hiatus" in a way:)   Have you seen Joe lately?  How was Joel's set the last
time he was in town?  Still spinning that hardcore I bet:-) 

As far as those who were upset over that misprint.  No worries.....If Stickman
is promoting it....It'll be good!

it really depends on the maturity, emotional condition, and knowledge of

once again, all chemicals have the potency to really fuck you up if you 
do them, but i suppose marijuana is the safest overall

injection is BAD because of disease......most of the rest are safe.....

i wouldnt call anyone a loser for doing drugs, but i would definitelt 
call them stupid....there are long term effects of drug use, and anyone 
who thinks there isnt is stupid; thus if anyone is willing to risk being 
fucked up permanently because they just want to be fucked up that 
indicates to me a low level of intelligence.

i find that people under the influense of anything tend to act in an 
unnatural manner (from their normal life).....E may not be the worst 
drug, but why is it being done??? to increase your ability to be 
social??? thats NOT a good reason....while people on E may act nice, 
thats not the way they are all of the time, understand??? i believe that 
in alot of instances people do drugs to make up for a part of them they 
feel is lacking.....drugs act as a relief, not a cure...

anyway, im not against other peoples drug use, but i find it sad and 
frustrating because i cant just start lecturing them on why i feel drugs 
are bad.....i try to tell the people i know who do drugs why theyre bad, 
and they just dont listen......its somethin you have to learn for 
yourself.....it makes me sad when someone does find out, because that 
means they had a bad experience that could have been avoided by just 
listening....theres no way to guarantee that whatever drug you choose to 
use is going to have the reaction you desire and thats a problem....its 
all different, and what might be okay for one person, could be terrible 
for another and seriously fuck them up......for example, at the nothing 
(pgh, august 30) a few of my friends took some of the same acid....2 of 
them took one hit, one of them took 2 hits....they all had done acid 
more than once before.....after 5 hours or so of everyone being okay, 
one of my friends started to flip out and had to be dragged out fighting 
a cop.....which friend??? the one who had tripped the most.....how many 
hits did he take??? 1....1 hit of acid made him try to fist fight his 
friends, a cop, and anyone who wanted to walk down the stairs by the 
time we took him to his house, he was immobile, his eyes were open, he 
wouldnt talk and he was drooling and pissing himself.....all from 1 hit 
of acid.....there was no way to predict that such a thing would happen, 
but as you see, even experience and amount taken were null in the 
end......an apparently okay decicion turned out shitty..

Huge raves, yes.  Huge clubs, yes.  Huge commercialized
super-expensive super-hyped super-impersonal $$$-fests.  Sponsored
by tobacco, soft drink and record companies.  

Yeah, I feel like I'm "part" of something.  I feel "involved".  I
feel "special" when I'm one of 10,000 faces in the door.  

This music is so cool.  It's so special.  It's so neat when I can
hear it on every television station, every radio station, every
supermarket isle, every elevator, doctor's office, pub and
resturaunt.

Techno in the UK is pop.  It's top-40.

Do you _really_ want that?

Where's the underground, there?  Wheres' the DYI?  There is none.
It's illegal.  Unless it's in a club or a special venue licensed
through megabuck licenses, it's not going to happen.  And if the
occasional outlaw party starts up, club owners call up and shut it
down.

It hurts business.

And that wonderful Criminal Justice Bill.  Where if you have more
than a half-dozen people outside together, it's legally a riot and
everyone can be arrested.  Or if more than three cars are driving
down a road in close succession, it's legally a caravan and they can
be pulled over and searched.

Yes.

Wonderful.

Techno has been blown up by the media in England and _look_ where
they have got because of it.

I heard word that that Lesson No.9 has been cancelled or postponed due to lack
of funds? If anyone has info on this please let me know. 

Also- to correct the ROM, Geometrix has been postponed until April. The date

what are u talking about?  in the early 90's, pearl jam and nirvana got
into just as heavy rotation at mtv as bush did in the mid-90's.  they're
not cleaner, more appealing, or better looking.  their music and their
image is so not like seattle grunge.  and what does that mean when u say 
that the "point" of their music is to sell albums and feed off the general
public?

Im not being mean or anything but I totally  disagree with your
statement about the punk scene mainly because I grew up listening to
punk rock and grew up in the punk scene and I am currently still into
it heavily but the thing is that the modern commercialization of punk
being Green Day and suh has totally screwed up the punk scene because
now Im not mad at any mainstream ppl in fact I like having them in the
scene but the thing is all of theses jocks go to punk rawk concerts to
fight and push and mosh around they break things and steal things and
now it is hard to find places that will let you have punk concerts now
and mainstream America is afraid of us now because they think that all
punks are like this and these ppl use the excuse of stealing and
fighting is punk but its not so I feel to much commercialization of
any seen can ruin it but a little can also help it out...
Sorry about comparing scenes I really hated to do that but I felt that
it needed to be said so that you dont get the wrong impression...
Thank You

i'm a pacifist.  have u ever seen documentaries on the civil war, where
two teams would line up, face each other, and take turns shooting, until
only one team was left standing?  sounds pretty retarded, huh?  well i
think the wars we fight to resolve conflicts today are the same, but we
hide behind trees and we have machine guns and bombs and stuff.

[Kira Huntzinger]  Everbody's elititst except the damn hippies.

I think ravers need to stop being so elitist (not that I'm saying I don't
act this way as well).  In order to have a good thing, it doesn't have to
be hidden from everybody else.  Fuck everybody else, keep the spirit
alive yourself.

ABSOLUT

PS-Regardling Hillfiger and allt hat other shit, much of it is purchased
by ravers because of the fact that many of the designs cater to the rave
scene.  Reflective clothing, skilled design (think about how much rave
flyers are stressed and the design put into them compared to the design
and style put into much of that style of clothing.

> ... I didn't know you held Mtv so close to your heart. ... Mtv >

you mean the US isn't the center of the universe?!) ... 

     I think you're getting confused about which ideas you believe.  
First you bash me for denying that "MTV has ruined pop music" and then 
you try to tell me that "MTV doesn't dominate the market".
     Anyway, all I was trying to say in the first place was that "pop 
music" has NEVER been about what is "good".  Try to tell someone from 
the Beatles era or the Elvis era, both pre-MTV eras, that pop music than 
wasn't about image and marketing!  What's the difference between 
millions of people letting the radio and Ed Sullivan tell them what's 
"good" and millions of people letting MTV tell them what's good?  
Granted, MTV is visual and radio isn't, but it's not as if how artists 
looked visually wasn't important in the age of radio.  Once again, take 
Elvis and the Beatles.  People, especially females, LOVED the way they 
looked.  What are some of the things that you inevitably think of when 
thinking of Elvis?  A funky lip?  A weird pelvic dance?  A big black 
quaff of hair?  All visuals.  In fact, it could probably argued that, 
simply because what was accepted was stricter, visual image was MORE 
important in the past than it is today.  The Beatles would have barely 
even touched America let alone England if they wouldn't have "cleaned" 
up their looks and started wearing suits instead of leather jackets.  
     Or, how 'bout this?: When Rock 'n' Roll was first beginning, radio 
stations, because of racism in America, would only play versions of 
songs composed by African-American artists if they we're covers by white 
people?  Or, think about the very structure of the typical Rock song, a 
structure that was formulated way before MTV ever came around. 
Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Verse, etc.  Total time of song=2:30.  What could be 
more market-oriented!?  
     I don't know, the whole thing just seems really obvious to me.  I'd 
would appreciate input from anyone else that agrees or disagrees with my 
opinion.  

                                               Aaron

btw, this is kind of late, but Biz was absolutely incredibly wonderful.
i danced 6 hours straight. i'd been especially miserable all day, but
once i got there, it was an instant contact high. pure positive energy!
every beat was like a reaffirmation of the joy of existence.
i haven't been to another event since though.
wishing to go to terminal velocity, but such might have wide-reaching
negative consequences. sigh.

Im not trying to be mean or anything but have you ever heard this band
Bush or seen them or Nirvana if you have its plain to see that Bush
justs wants to be Nirvana they sound like Nirvana they act like
Nirvana and they try to look like Nirvana...The main differences are
Nirvanas music was real they wrote it from the heart but Bush makes
stupid songs about nothing and try to get paid and another thing Kurt
Cobain was never a teen heart throb he was a long haired dirty
junkie...And I like him for that...and Bush is on the cover of every
single teenage magazine wearing desiner clothes preaching a message of
look at me if you model your life after someone else you can be this
rich too...but Kurt was just a no good punk from Seatle with a
message...
Sorry: I know this post makes no sense whatsoever but its the truth

Thank You
E-REX
PS: MTV and country music are both government conspiracys to destroy
America and make us totally powerless...So dont watch MTV or listen to
Country...EVER...

hey...

for some reason, my email service decided to not send me any of my mail
for the last couple of days, so i decided to check the archives on
what's being discussed on the good old {pb-cle} list, and what do you
know? its time for round 30 of the "commercialization of the rave scene"
arguement (it's been a couple of days, hasn't it? :)   i know everyone
wants to rant on and on about their opinion about everything... i am
just happy that i wont have a giant heap of that shit in my inbox that i
would have to delete one by one. maybe the sys admin was doing me a
favor :)

>>>>>>>>>absolut sez:
PS-Regardling Hillfiger and allt hat other shit, much of it is purchased

by ravers because of the fact that many of the designs cater to the rave

scene. Reflective clothing, skilled design (think about how much rave
flyers are stressed and the design put into them compared to the design
and style put into much of that style of clothing.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<,


while that is an interesting point indeedy, i think it has more to do
with the fact that ravers (at least the ones who are buying up the tommy
hill and nautica) are a bunch of rich kids. rich kids like brand name
clothes, simple as that. go check out what the rich kids are wearing @
all the private high schools... brand name shit. maybe a different
style, but the same brands at least. that kinda gear is just supposed to
look high-tech and expensive. i'd say the the designers cater to any one
who's got the money for somethin' that looks phat, not necessarily the
ravers.

Subject: {pb-cle} my response to several of the posts regarding drug use
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

All right, I'm probably going to end up crucifying myself again for sharing my
opinion and personal experience, but here goes...

Okay, so what is "responsible" drug use?  Well, during all of high school and
my first year of college, when I was straightedge, I didn't think there could 
be any such thing.  "Responsible" drug use to me meant someone controlling their
diabetes -- self-medicating, stuff like that -- if anything.  This was my life 
 up until I was 20
years old.  For reasons that are completely my own, I decided to try acid with
a friend who had done it before.  Now I was exactly like every other really
sheltered kid whose sole knowledge of all drugs stemmed from school health
classes and DARE classes, and I used to preach that if you did acid you would
"fry your brain" and be "legally insane" and I believed all of it entirely.  So,
before I would even consider trying the stuff, I got my hands on all the
literature I could find about it.  I read government information, hyperreal
information, chemical synthesis info -- I read the whole book written by the
scientist who discovered the stuff in 1938.  Animal tests, human experiences --
I literally read every scrap of information I could get my hands on before I
would even think of putting it in my body.  Then, when I thought that I had
been sufficiently educated on the subject (I never stop reading, though -- you
can never know too much) -- my friend and I each ate a hit of gel.  We were
also in the company of a completely sober person who would be able to drive us
anywhere, if needed.  I was not at a rave; I was in a quiet, safe environment. 
And, I had a good time.  That is what every first drug experience should be
like -- and that is what I would consider to have been "responsible" drug use. 
When I decided to try ecstasy, I went through the same process -- as much
written research as I could find (since I've found that hearsay is about as
bullshit as it gets.  All you get are the urban legends, seldom the truth). 
While on E, I always make sure to drink plenty of water, to take plenty of
breaks from dancing -- and I remind myself not to act any differently than I
usually do (people, you Should have this kind of control!)  

The way I see it, it's not necessarily experience that is the key to ensuring
that you will never get hurt, never have a bad trip, etc.  Experience helps,
but the most important thing to always do is Remember that you have taken a
mind-altering substance, Remember all the possible side effects and keep on the
lookout for them, and basically -- don't ever expect that things will just go a
certain way.  You are in more control than you might think.  If you start to
feel like you might be going into a bad trip -- recognize it, tell a friend to
walk you outside -- do whatever that you think might help.  It is the second
you stop being aware of everything around you that you might start losing
control.  That is what I consider "responsible" drug use -- and please, see my
opinion for what it is, an opinion.

I do not use drugs as an 'escape,' especially acid -- cause what in the hell am
I escaping to?  My multi-colored, warping hand?  I don't like to use the stuff
too often anyway, since frankly, I think it lasts too long to be continually
fun.  I don't do E to 'be more social,' I do it because it's fun to do with a
friend or two -- like a lot of people like to go out for a couple drinks every
so often.  I don't see how that's an 'escape' either.

What drugs are "okay" and why?  No drug is "okay" for everyone, maybe not for
most people.  I think addictive drugs, and mostly, but not exclusively, things 
you snort or inject are a bad idea.  I won't ever snort or inject anything.  I 
know only what drugs I consider "okay" for me, and I know that there are many, 
many people who should never use anything, EVER!!!, given their personality, 
or whatever. 

At what age is one "responsible" to make their own decisions about their drug
use?  Chronological age has NOTHING to do with it.  When I was ready to try any
drug at all, I was 20.  That is going to be different for everybody. Also, many
people who are "responsible" enough to make their own decisions concerning this
choose never to do any drugs.

I am not going to say that I have never had a bad drug experience (although
I've only had one, and not on acid or E) -- and it sucked.  It was really 
terrible.  But my way of looking at this is -- Well, I definitely won't ever
put myself into that situation ever again.  I have a better understanding of
what my personal limits are, what I can and can't deal with if I have to.  And
I will never do this particular drug again (mushrooms).  This is a decision
I've made, a "responsible" one by anyone's standards, I think.

The drugs that I feel to be absolutely too dangerous and not "okay" are coke,
crystal, smack, and several others in the same families as these drugs.  The
others: E, pot, acid, mushrooms, ketamine -- all have the potential to be bad
for individual people, but are perhaps not 'as bad' as the first ones I
mentioned.  These are not all even things that I have necessarily tried or plan 
on ever trying -- but it is reasonable for some people to be able to use any 
one  of these "responsibly," and not get seriously hurt.

By the way, I have never come across any information that said CONCLUSIVELY
that past lsd use causes any birth defects.  I certainly wouldn't do it while
pregnant or anything like that -- but Jenifer, since you mentioned this -- for
my own information I'm wondering if you could point me in the direction of
material that says this.  Thank you.

My conclusion: For the most part, when having discussions about drugs people
tend to rarely agree on much.  Sometimes I feel like it's the Edgers vs. the
Junkies and there's no room for being anywhere in the middle.  I'm somewhere in
the middle, and I'm just sharing my opinion.  I am an expert only on my own
personal experience, which applies only to me -- I don't want to tell anyone
what to think or what to do.  If a friend came to me and said, "I think I want
to try ____," I would first tell them to get themselves to a library and look
around on the net before they tried anything at all.  That would be my adivce
to a friend, as it would be my advice to anyone.  Knowing as much as you can
about something can only be a good thing, whether you eventually try something
or not.  It goes along with being "responsible."

No kidding Kira,

    What is it with everyone needing to feel special, and being elitest?
What's wrong with other people getting into the scene?    Craig wants to feel
oh so different from everyone, so then he can go and show how cool the rave
scene is, but then not let anyone else find out for themselves.  But what
makes him(or anyone else) different isn't the Addidas/Tommy
Hillfiger/Polo/Jnco/Kikwear/fill in with any other designer label clothes that
he wears. It isn't the music he listens to.  It's the fact that he is him.  He
brings himself to the scene, and thereby has made it more diverse. So why not
allow other people to come into the scene and make it even more diverse?
Yeah, I understand where you're coming from with the club scene thing in
England to a point.  I used to go to Trilogy back in the day, and listen to
music, and dance and have a good time with friends.  Now when I go, I have to
beware of getting hit with beer bottles by drunken frat boys, and have to
negotiate through the crowds of guys looking at the cage dancers in order to
get to the bathroom.  I used to hate it, but then I realized that I wasn't
gonna let anyone else ruin my fun.  They were gonna be there regardless, so I
had two choices.  1.) Not go anymore(which was hard, because up until recently
there wasn't really anything else going on on Sundays, or 2.) Adapt to the
situation. I chose the later. I'm not going to lie to you and everyone else on
here and say that I don't have problems with extreme commercialism in todays
society.  I'm really not for anyone becoming a walking billboard for anyone
elses products(although with clothing today, it's difficult not to) But music
is music, a scene is a scene, and it's whatever you make of it.  I mean if you
actually think that other people are coming into the scene to purposely fuck
it up, you're pretty much wrong.  Yeah, people will come to find out for
themselves if what they're hearing about "the next big thing" is true.  In
today's media based society, it's inevitable that people won't find out about
raves one way or another.  If they like it, then they'll stay, if not they'll
leave after awhile.
     One must realize that everything comes around in cycles.  Things start
small, then they get big, then they go back underground.  You may say that the
scene is fucked up right now(i.e. Shady promoters, prolific drug use, etc),
but after the general populous gets done with its "Electronica"(God I hate
that word) kick, then it'll be back in the hands of those who really
appreciated it, and made it that big thing in the first place, and those who
continually scene hop, will find something else.  Maybe the "Next big thing"
will be polka music, and kids will beg their parents for accordians for
Christmas/Hanukah/B-day, and instead of claiming eastside/westside, people
will try to prove that their ancesters are from the "old country".
     Well, I had other stuff to say, but I forgot it now.  And I appoligize if
this seems to jump around, but I'm all doped up on medication for my cold, and
can't think straight.  That's it for now.....If you want to flame me, go right
ahead, but at least I said what I wanted to say(kinda).

"shooting up" + "using heroin" are not interchangeable phrases. i
haven't done either but just for your information, heroin can be snorted
and i think smoked. pretty much anything can be shot up. but the benefits
and detriments of any drug are subjective. heroin is highly addictive and
fairly dangerous but i will not condemn somebody who uses it or has used
it for that reason only. if somebody is using any drugs irresponsibly
(like they have not educated themselves first on the risks, or they are
using drugs because they feel depressed, or their drug use endangered
someone else's life) and/or becomes addicted though, that person has a
problem & should either stop or learn what they can do to be more
responsible.

that's nothing. you know you're REALLY a star wars geek when you put the
figures of C3PO and R2D2 into erotic positions. gives a whole new meaning
to "computer love" ;)

my brother has one of boba fett + when he first got it, at night it
surprised me since sometimes it looked like a real person. 

he's definitely a star wars geek because he says he's serious when he said
he wants to hold a star wars convention in the back yard.

Heh, I hope "for as long as he wants" implies a nice long set, and 
not "as long as he wants" as in the style of mr robert armani  ;-)

Thanks

Dan

I think that this is a great post in fact the best of the day on this
subject...I agree with most of what Amanda said in the fact that I
think that you should have reliable info. and try it first around
someone who is sober...I only wish I had done this when I strted
taking drugs mainly because I was 11 or so when I started and
eventually I did anything and everything and had alot of problems with
drugs...Some may say I still do because I trip,pop pills,and smoke
pot...however I disagree because I feel I am doing it responsibly now
and I now know the effects...However there truly is no responsible way
to do drugs but now I dont trip and snort on a daily basis in fact I
havnt snorted or shot up in over 2 years and dont plan to ever do it
again...however I am still a strong Sid and Shroom advocate...Well I
guess all I am saying is dont just take a drug cause its there like I
do find out about it first...

Thank You
E-REX
PS:I dont care if you legalize pot or not I am going to smoke it
anyways...

  "Deep Thoughts" by Jack Handy.
**********************************************************
If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let'em
go, because, man, they're gone.

To me, it's a good idea to always carry two sacks of
something when you walk around.  That way, if anybody
says, "Hey, can you give me  a hand?"  You can
say, "Sorry, got these sacks."

The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of
the face.

If you lived in the Dark Ages and you were a catapult
operator, I  bet the most common question people would ask
is, "Can't you make it shoot farther?"
"No, I'm sorry.  That's as far as it shoots."

Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful
flamingo,flying across in front of a beautiful sunset?  And he's
carrying a beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a
very beautiful painting with his feet.  And also, you're drunk.

If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the
mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a
panic.

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no
choreography and the dancers hit each other.

If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the
lemons (maybe by shoving them down his throat).

Instead of having "answers" on a math test, they should just
call them "impressions," and if you got a different
"impression," so what, can't we all be brothers?

I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so
bummed out that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a
few years, because I was thinking about doing that anyway.

I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate
revolver.  And since he's so busy, you'd probably have to run
up to him real quick and hand it to him.

It's easy to sit there and say you'd like to have more money.
And I guess that's what I like about it.  It's easy.  Just sitting
there, rocking back and forth, wanting that money.

If you ever reach total enlightenment while you're drinking a
beer, I bet it makes beer shoot out your nose.

As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to
red again, I sat there thinking about life.  Was it nothing more
than a bunch of honking and yelling?  Sometimes it seemed
that way.

I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without
hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because
they'd never expect it.

I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays
its eggs in my brain, because later you might think you're
having a good idea but it's just eggs hatching.

Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right
there, in the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to
read good books.

What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds
singing and the wind rustling through the leaves, that makes
you want to get drunk? And after you're real drunk, maybe go
down to the public park and stagger around and ask people
for money, and then lay down and go  to sleep.

Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window?  The guy
looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out.  Wait.  I
guess that's like a regular window.

During the Middle Ages, probably one of the biggest
mistakes was not putting on your armor because you were
"just going down to the corner."

If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people,
like I am now.

When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was
call the police.  But then I got curious about it.  I picked it up,
and started wondering who this person was, and why he had
deer horns.

I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch
and whittle all day long.  Once he whittled me a toy boat out
of a larger toy boat I had.  It was almost as good as the first
one, except now it had bumps and whittle marks all over it.
And no paint, because he had whittled off the paint.

Here's a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don't
know anybody: First take out the garbage.  Then go around
and collect any extra garbage that people might have, like a
crumpled napkin, and take that out too.  Pretty soon people
will want to meet the busy garbage guy.

Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand
your rights, even if you don't know what your rights are, or
who the person is you're talking to. Then on the way out,
slam the door.

If you're a cowboy and you're dragging a guy behind your
horse, I bet it would really make you mad if you looked back
and the guy was reading a magazine.

If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, I
think it's okay to feed some bits of your friend to one of the
vultures, to teach him to do some tricks.  But only if you're
serious about adopting the vulture.

Broken promises don't upset me.  I just think, why did they
believe me?

If you ever crawl inside an old hollow log and go to sleep, and
while you're in there some guys come and seal up both ends
and then put it on a truck and take it to another city, boy, I
don't know what to tell you.

If you go to a costume party at your boss's house, wouldn't
you think a good costume would be to dress up like the
boss's wife?  Trust me, it's not.

Most of the time it was probably real bad being stuck down
in a dungeon. But some days, when there was a bad storm
outside, you'd look out your little window and think, "Boy, I'm
glad I'm not out in that."

Consider the daffodil.  And while you're doing that, I'll be over
here, looking through your stuff.

For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here's a tip: why
not add a slice of lemon to each jar, for freshness?

If I was the head of a country that lost a war, and I had to
sign a peace treaty, just as I was signing, I'd glance over the
treaty and then suddenly act surprised. "Wait a minute!  I
thought we won!"

Somebody told me how frightening it was how much topsoil
we are losing each year, but I told that story around the
campfire and nobody got scared.

I hope that after I die, people will say of me: "That guy sure
owed me a lot of money."

I wish I had a dollar for every time I spent a dollar, because
then, Yahoo!, I'd have all my money back.

I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat."  It's a fake
baby duck, which you strap on top of your head.  Then you
go swimming underwater until you find a mommy duck and
her babies,  and you join them.  Then all of the sudden, you
stand up out of the water and roar like Godzilla.  Man those
ducks really take off!  Also Baby Duck Hat is good for
parties.

If you get invited to your first orgy, don't just show up nude.
That's a common mistake.  You have to let nudity "happen."

The tired and thirsty prospector threw himself down at the
edge of the watering hole and started to drink.  But then he
looked around and saw skulls and bones everywhere.
"Uh-oh," he thought.  "This watering hole is reserved for
skeletons."

You know what?  I don't fucking care about Mtv.  I'm busy all day with
classes and lessons and rehearsals.  By the time I come home my whole
freaking head is buzzing and all I want to do is crawl into bed and let
the glowing box numb my brain.  If Mtv is entertaining for the moment,
fine; if A&E is entertaining for the moment, fine.  I am so tired of
music.  It's stupid discussions like this that make me want to never sing
another fucking note and be a fucking bum.

while that is an interesting point indeedy, i think it has more to do
with the fact that ravers (at least the ones who are buying up the tommy
hill and nautica) are a bunch of rich kids.

Damn, chill the fuck out.  Shooting up is dumb (IMHO), but people do do
it, and it isn't always as bad as you are making it out to be.

RE: TERMINAL VELOCITY THIS SAT NITE

I would just like to inform everyone that i WAS NEVER booked for this event.
The promoters tried to book me but i was booked to a prior engagement so i
told them i couldnt do their event.
THEY THEN PRINT FLIERS AS IF I WAS BOOKED.
They made some lame excuse that some guy said he booked me..whatever
IF YOUR GOING TO THIS EVENT TO SEE ME I WONT BE THERE..
THE PROMOTERS ARE LAME & UNPROFESSIONAL SO YOURE PROBABLY
BETTER OFF NOT GOING.
THEY MAKE ME LOOK BAD AS IF I DID A NO-SHOW WITHOUT CARING ABOUT THE KIDS WHO
PAY HARD EARNED $ TO SEE CERTAIN DJS..
BUT ITS THEM WHO DONT CARE
DONT SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO LIE TO YOU & SAY THEY BOOKED SOMEONE THEY DIDNT...IM
SURE OTHERS ON THE LINEUP WONT BE THEIR EITHER.
TELL EVERYBODY THIS NEWS..I THANK YOU..

to all those who dont really care..i apologize..
i am looking out for the best interests of all of us...
thanks

I agree with you completely.  People in America (although I haven't been
to many other countries) are too quick to try and put the blame on
somebody else.  "Oops, I spilled some hot coffee on my lap because I'm a
dumb-ass and put the cup between my legs and then tried to drive.  I
know!  I'll sue McDonalds!"  That is the kind of mentality that people
have and although it doesn't seem like it would, it relates very well to
the rave scene.  Its your fault as a parent if your kid goes to a rave
and goes completely mental on some mind altering substanes, not the
promoter's.

First, I would like to state that I don't think you're being sarcastic.
If i'm wrong, just call me a dummy head.

Second, I don't think it's "your fault as a parent if your kid goes to a
rave and goes completely mental on some mind altering substances".  I
would think that it's the KID'S fault.  You can drill it into some little
ankle-biter's head til you're blue in the face that drugs are bad for you
and, chances are, they won't listen.  If every child listened to their
parents, I doubt we'd even have a scene to argue about.  If they're
making a decision to do drugs, than they can face the consequences.  It's
not ALL up to the parent.  Parents, as human beings (oh my god, they're
not superheros?) can only do so much.  The rest is up to the child.

Greetings from the listadmin of the Western New York/Southern Ontario Rave Scene (WNYSOR-L) discussion list.  I thought this would be of interest to a broader audience, so I'm sending this out.  It's not often that you can hear The Orb live.


	http://www.techno.ca/module


	Although this hasn't been finalized, there will be an attempt made to broadcast the Module event in Toronto live over Real Audio commencing at 10pm EST.  If you haven't heard The Orb live yet, then this may give you a chance.  

	Le Petit Orb will be playing, which is a smaller version of The Orb featuring only Alex and Andy.  There are a host of other fine locals, and other musicians.

	Drop in the IRC channel #module on EFNet and you can talk with others who are listening to the broadcast.  Grab mIRC from http://www.mirc.com to get an IRC client.

	If you want to be notified via email prior to the event (handy if you're not in Toronto's time zone), then email mentalfloss@techno.ca with the subject "module" and I'll send a quick one to you.


this module contains:


	Mixmaster Morris, Ninja Tune, Virgin, Mixmag, UK

	Vapourspace (live), ffrr, NY

	Yakudo, Traditional Japanese Taiko Drumming Ensemble

	Spencer Kinsey, aka Gemini, Cajual, chicago


	A man called warwick, Toronto

	Eric Downer, Toronto

	Polyphonic, Toronto

	Algorithm, Toronto

	Marcus, Toronto

	Aria, Toronto

	Split, Toronto

	Ali, Toronto

	Asi, Toronto

	D..., Toronto


There are also video artists.. but not like you guys care. :)

nice opinion...but the reality is like with the mcdonald incident, the

Yeah. It usually feels better than anything you've ever felt -- sex,
drugs taken other ways, food/eating -- that's the problem. Don't kid
yourself, or anyone else.

Wow, I thought that was only on my local news in Indiana.  Apparently,
they have some sort of tie to Indiana because they were caught doing
something similar here.  (Oh my gosh, there's a world out side of
Indiana?!)

Painful death, good movie!  Especially in a movie theatre!

Good thing ravers drink ONLY bottled water!  Get ready to bathe in Evian

Heehee, keep your gasmasks on!

It's interesting that someone brought this subject up.   Here's little info
for all of you..OH...this is all public knowledge so...if you're interested
just go to the library and look it up:)  

In Arizona, the US federal govenment has a testing and containment facility
designed especially for disease and viruses.   The buliding where these
diseases and viruses are kept is divided into "5 levels".  Each level has
certain critera for the viruses that it holds.  

FOR EXAMPLE!   The common cold and the flu....they are on level one.
I think that chicken pox is level two.

The more serious the disease or virus....the higher the level its on.   Now
get this!

The Ebola virus....the one that "eats your flesh" with 48
hours...well...actually...it doesn't eat your flesh...it just makes every pore
on your body bleed and when you're covered in blood ...it looks like you have
no skin.

ANYWAY!  The ebola is ONLY ON LEVEL 3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Think about it folks......anthrax is bad...it's close to the ebola virus...but
if they have 5 levels...and ebola is only on level 3....I can't even imaging
what they've got in level 5!!!
I mean thats got to be one vicious disease/virus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   

So.....if a war breaks out.....RUN TO THE HILLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Love and Smiles
Jason

Yeah. It usually feels better than anything you've ever felt---

Chill the fuck out.... Ok I have had 5 friends (only one was a really close
friend) over the last 7 years die, and 3 others go to the hosipital, from
shooting up shit. Not just H, but speed, and other wack shit.

Your right, after seeing soo many people die, I should just sit around and
listen to a bunch of retards talk about how it isn't soo bad, man FUCK YOU
it is bad.
You can argue with me about a promoter, you can argue with me about music,
and after a while I may just see that you are right, and say Damn your
right, I was wrong ... sorry.

But to any one that shoots up anything, your a moron... Flame me all you
want.. But you just wait till the girl/boy that you met a year ago at the
super rave dies from shooting up, then i want to see you come back and  say
"I wouldn't hold it against or critisize someone just because they shoot
up, if they do it responsibly...." BULLSHIT!!

Get a real grip on the evils of that crap before the reality of it grabbs
someone you know and there gone.

yo yo yo:

i say run to altlanta.  here is the lowdown on biosafety levels.  virology
is the shit:

http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bmbl/bmbl-1.htm

if the public knew that there were trillions of them on their faces.
actually, most viruses and bacteria are helpful to the average human.  they
just get hyped by the media like everything that remains.

peace, not biowar,

I was just putzing around MTV's website and they have a section for video
clips...if you look under AMP there's a whole donkeyload of em', including
our own good pal and hero 187's video "We are Not Alone" done by none
other than our good pal and hero and listmember MSKW!

There's lots of other one's (photek, 4hero, etc etc etc)...kina big to dl,
and short, but worth checkin' out if you have the time/bandwidth.

Good Job Michael......The only copy I saw was the one done right after

ask for a copy:)

 	I would just like to say that this report is a repeat.  They lost
a story and had to replace it!  We've all heard the arguements before.
In fact I was one of the staunchest arguers!  I'd just like to request
that we don't get too insane over this!  PLEASE.  That is all.

Oh and, STOP the raves!

> u can sniff heroin?  is that safe?

Have you seen the movie Pulp Fiction?  The part where Marcellus 
Wallace's (sp) wife OD's and has to have a syringe of adrenaline shot 
straight into her heart, what she sniffs is heroine.  She must've 
thought it was coke or something and did a huge rail of it, but it 
was really really expensive heroin and at really fucked her up...can 
you imaging waking up with a syringe stuck through your sternum? 
ouch...

Hey, sleepy
Just wanna make sure you didn't mis-read what I was replying to this
Keebler dude. My point is saying the drug feels that good is that is WHY
it is such a a problem. It's almost impossible to resist, contrary to
what ppl think who believe they can control it, or only do it once in a
while.

I actually laughed out loud and fell out of my seat at the part where they said
the way we find out where the raves are is through secret passwords. 
Hmm... funny... I've HEARD some people make reference to this 'secret raver
code' before -- is there something all you guys know that you just aren't
telling me?  Is this some kind of a conspiracy?  Oh, and I was also really
impressed with the, shall we say, *caliber* of the panel of raver kids that
talked to the main interviewer.  Yeah, these kids seemed like a REALLY GOOD
representation of the scene as a whole ("like uh, dude, like the E, it has like
heroin in it").  Anyway, I can't honestly work my little old self into any
kind of a frenzy over the bias or misinformation of this report.  It is, after
all, Barabra Walters 'n' the Gang.

So, it was most definitely the same report.  I'm still kinda mad.  I still
e-mailed them, again.  If you'd like to e-mail them:

	www.abcnews.com

		go to abcnews shows
			go to weekly shows to 20/20
				click the survey off
				go to e-mail et voila

Maybe things will change
	(optimism never hurt nothin')

The first time 20/20 did the rave storie I went crazy, got like a million
people to write in and all.... but this time I just sat there and listened
to the show, and ya know they really didn't say anything that wasn't true.
That's very sad, very sad.
I mean they didn't have to go as far as saying hold on to your kids , raves
will kill them , or what ever wording they chose to use, but besides the
sensationalism of trying to get ratings, there facts were straight.

Yea the kids they chose were pretty dorkie, and kind of slow, but guess
what, turn around at a party, close your eyes  spin around fast and
randomly point somewhere, when you look, I'm sure you'll see a kid acting
and looking just like those schmucks.

Something has got to happen.. 70% of ravers do get wacked at parties, that
sucks. I dought if it will ever change, but I know that if it dosen't, it
will kill the rave scene.

If you notice, there are less and less spaces that are willing to rent to
US. this is because of the drugs, the taggers and general morons, yes this
happens in other scenes as well, but even the cool space owners who can
deal with the insurance liability of tagging and destruction can't hang
with the drug part.

??? is all I can say.

from the N take 71 S to the morse rd/sinclair exit (exit #116).  L at the
1st light, to morse, L on morse, drive under highway and look for 1st
right.  follow as below.

from points E or W take 70 to columbus, find 71 N, follow as below.

from points S or from central columbus take I 71 to the morse rd exit
(exit #116). take a R on morse.

everyone: once on morse going E, immediately start looking for your first
R, which will be GLENMAWR (if you pass the BP you've gone too far).  take
glenmawr back to the first alley marked "K of C" (for knights of
columbus), follow alley to the R, back to the space.  if the parking lot
is full please respectfully park on the street.

admission is going to be lowered from $13 to $12 due to the last-minute 
disappearance of paris mack (1/2 of heckle & jeckle) to san diego.  we'll

[anyone who was expecting dom&roland, we apologize but his agent confirmed

Invisible Reoords is pleased to announce the "Lowest of the Low" 1998
North American tour
featuring 5 main bands complimented by special guests at various points
in the tour.

"Not Breathing" will open the evening with its blend of hard techno and
experimental noise.

"Bagman" is the side project of Lee "Bastard" Fraser of Sheep on Drugs.
Lee remains one of the most prominent artists working in the field of
jungle and electronic music.

"F.M. Einheit" of Einsturzende Neubauten will make a rare North America
appearance with his 4 piece band.  Industrial madness.

"Scorn" - Dub terrorist Mick Harris' group Scorn has recieved critical
support and has established a wide audience for his pioneering ambient
dub.

"Pigface"  - if your familiar with the old; this is ALOT different,
ambient and danceable with some of the old thrown in too.  In addition
to the usual suspects including Martin Atkins, Charles Levi (My Life
with the TKK), Bob Dog, Curse Mackey (Evil Mothers) and Meg Lee Chin,
three other performers have been confirmed:  Gus Ferguson (Test Dept and
Dead Can Dance), Vas Kallas (Hanzel und Gretyl) and Jared Hendrickson
(Chemlab).  Additional contributors TBA.

    The evening will be seamless...with respect to your time, money,
ears and eyes; this event will be coming to you complete with an ultra
low end sound system and state of the art visual manipulations (Genesis
P. Orridge) to stimulate and already overstimulated audience. This is
not to be missed.  

Wednesday April 8th, 1998  Metropol
advance tickets $12.50

Well, with that attitude of course your kid won't listen to you :)

It's

No, but parents do instill values in children, and I do believe that if a
kid makes an irresponsible decision early in his life (younger than 15)
then part of the blame does fall on the parents.  Of course there are
instances where this isn't correct, but I'm just making generalizations.

Since something tells me that whatever netmeet we planned just *might*
not work, (although I'll still be hanging out at the bathroom area
around 2am <grin> ) I just wanted to say that if you see a guy who's
about 5'11 and has long brown hair, walking around or dancing, wearing a
bright gold short sleeved Addias shirt <the classic>, to stop him and
say 'HI!'. (that guy would be me for those of you scratching your heads)

   Hope to see you all out there tonight!

    peace,

I'm a trance dj from South Florida.  I mix hard,
acid, melodic, and psytrance (Goa).  I've been here
(FL) for six years but am originally from Cleveland. 
I mix weekly at the station address below and used to
mix with Arjuna on WOMB 107.1 in Miami Beach.  
Since I'm RPM director, I'm welcoming any electronica
djs to check out our site.  If you'll be visiting for
the Winter Music Conference, please join us for a
guest appearance.
In addition, if any of you could connect me with
tranceheads up there, I'll be visiting from March
20th - 29th.

Thanks for your help...peace and love, Bom da da

Hi, Valiant at GREEN LION PROMOTIONS here. I've taken on a number of
accomplished and up-n-coming artists. Below is my roster and contact
info.
For bookings, call 716-886-4121. Ask for Valiant. Do not call past
11PM!!!! Just courtesy(did i spell that right?) Website coming soon.

*MIKE PARKER/Defective Recs, Geophone Recs/Knowmatic Tribe, Trybet(acid 
techno/hard trance-DJ and LIVE PA)...Mike parker
is best known as one half of Trybet, out of Baltimore, MD. He has a
total of 9 Releases, on Defective Records(Baltimore), Virtual
Recordings(Germany), and his own label, Geophone Records(Buffalo).
His "Resonator" EP is huge right now, and has two more releases
lined up for the summer. He's done remixes for DJ Who, and has been 
remixed by various others, including Woody McBride aka DJ ESP.
His DJ sets are considered the finest in upstate, and his LIVE PA must
be seen to be believed.

*DJ XOTEC/FCFN, Knowmatic Tribe(Progressive, Deep, and Diva House, 
DJ)...XOTEC is somewhat of a Buffalo legend, having played at, or been 
resident at every major club night in the city. XOTEC was a finalist at 
this years FEVER BATTLE OF THE DJ's, and his sets are some of the most 
explosive you'll ever hear. XOTEC is truely one of favorite DJ's in the 
Upstate NY/Southern Ontario area. 

*SEAN MICHAELS/Hooligan Tribe(Hard, Deep House)...Sean helps run 
Rochester's Pure@Club Freakazoid. This tireless DJ has also helped throw 
some of the area's finest events. After turning out an explosive
set at Enter the Dragon in Buffalo, his set was on the lips of every 
party goer in the city for months. Don't miss this!

*DJ CABLE & CONCEPT/Atomic Mondays, Buffalo Underground-WBNY91.3FM
(Drum-n-bass, abstract beatz)...Cable and Concept have been residents
on Buffalo's jungle radio show, The Buffalo Underground, and throw
down at Atomic on Monday nights. They also turn out perfectly blunted
chill/downtempo sets. As a tag team or alone, they are sure to bring
the OOMPH! to any dance floor.

*JONNY WUNDER/Green Lion(Dancehall Raggae)...Jonny's set was one of the 
most memorable aspects of last fall's Enter the Dragon, Buffalo's
first drum-n-bass event, delivering a blistering dancehall raggae set 
that left the massif in awe. Playing out in buffalo every weekend, Jonny 
is looking to bring his ganja style to a bigger audience. This 
boy is definitely rude bwoy shtylee!

*MC VALIANT/Voltron Force, Green Lion(Jungle MC)...Yeah, this is me.
I MC now, and i'll be making a tape soon, so stay tuned.

Hey there.  I used to live in South Florida (Miami and then Davie -- near
Ft. Lauderdale).  I graduated from Florida International University in
Miami.  I'm now doing my graduate work at Penn State in State College,
PA.  I spin at WKPS, the student radio station here.  I will be home for
the WMC.  We should try to hook up.  I'm wondering if I've met you.  I've
been to the FAU radio station with my friend Saj (Racer X).  I spin
mostly downtempo abstract stuff (acid jazz, hip hop, ambient) and dnb
(all flavors).  My brother, Santiago Cevallos (sc1200@juno.com), lives in
Broward County.  He has a weekly gig at the coffee shop (the name escapes
me right now) across from The Cameo in South Beach.  Drop him a line, I'm
sure he'd like to hook up with you.  Maybe you can guest DJ at his gig. 
He spins jump up jungle and abstract downtempo.

Where will you be when you come "up here"?  I live in State College.  If
you're anywhere around this area, you can do a guest spot on my show
and/or spin with me at our regular gig ("The Cellar").


Peace,



Pedro Cevallos

I totally agree with you that parents play a large part in the beliefs of
their offspring.  Frankly, I think my parents, as weird as they are, did a
terrific job with my siblings and me.  They taught us through their 
example.  But I know other parents that seemed to be good parents and
their childrens still fucked up and (they were under the age of 15).  If a
kid wants to do drugs, drink, smoke, they CAN.  It is so easy to find it
WHERE EVER!  I know other people who's parents were total jerks and the
kids actually turned out to be some of the best people I know.  Once a
child achieves consciousness of the world around him/her, parents have no
control.  They can suggest and TRY and give guidance, but ultimately it's
up the the child. 

I only hope I can be half as good as my parents.

Okay, dude, I'll be there for sure. I'll hang till like 2:30, and I'll try
to wear some sort of nerdy thing that says PB-CLE MEAT or something silly
like that.

Anyone feel free to come up and say hello.

Pedro,

Saj (RacerX) is a resident on our Friday night show. 
We did the Renegade wharehouse party on the 23rd off
of Biscayne in Miami and the second one is March 6th.
 I think we used your brother's truck to haul a
system for an outdoor event once (or someone he knew).

Anyhow, I'll be in Cleveland.  I don't think I'll
make it to PState.  Since the first studio mix is
dedicated to trance and speed garage I don't think
that he'll be interested, but I'll e-mail him an
invitation for our upcoming d@b studio mix (Vuck will
ask Element, Saj, Tea Farmer (y'all know him,
right?), Grrl13,Soul Pro...)

Remember...WMC guests are welcome at our
station...AND....

I'm still looking for tranceheads in Cleveland to
trade mixes with when I visit between between March
20 - 29th.

'Avin It Down Here!!!! Hope to see you all.....

....tension breaker. ;)

***************************************************************

 LOS ANGELES--In an announcement that has caused grave concern within 
the nation's hip-hop community, the American
Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) revealed Monday 
that only two songs remain for rappers to sample,
Tiny Tim's "Tiptoe Through The Tulips" and Styx's "Mr. Roboto." 

      "Such albums as Puff Daddy's No Way Out and Mase's Harlem World 
have taken a heavy toll on our nation's precious
sample reserves, ASCAP president Richard Goffin said. "Our nation's rap 
artists must now face the consequences of their
failure to conserve this all-too-finite resource." 

      With such artists as Puff Daddy, Jay-Z, Foxy Brown, Snoop Doggy 
Dogg, and Method Man all slated to begin work on
new albums in the next six months, bidding for the sample rights to 
"Tiptoe Through The Tulips" and "Mr. Roboto" is expected
to be fierce. Puff Daddy, a.k.a. Sean "Puffy" Combs, has already stated 
that he is willing to pay up to $20 million for the rights
to the ukulele line in "Tiptoe" alone. 

      "Yo, I got to get that 'Tiptoe' track," Combs said in an interview 
in The Source magazine. "I ain't got an album without it." 

      Styx spokespersons said the band will attempt to maximize profits 
from "Mr. Roboto" by selling off the hit song from
1983's Kilroy Was Here piecemeal. "Our asking price for the song's 'Domo 
Arigato' spoken-word intro with synthesizer
backing is $25 million," Styx bassist Chuck Panozzo said. "As far as the 
lyric, 'My blood is boiling, my heart is human, my brain
IBM,' goes, I can't imagine we would be asking any less than $55 million 
for that." 

      While Monday's ASCAP announcement stunned rappers across the U.S., 
signs of the impending crisis were present years
ago. In 1989, James Brown became the first sample source to be 
exhausted, when the Jungle Brothers used a snippet of
Brown sneezing during an outtake for "The Big Payback" on its album Done 
By The Forces Of Nature. By 1992, the music of
numerous other high-profile artists was exhausted, including George 
Clinton, Rick James, Kool & The Gang, Prince and Queen. By 1995, nearly 
80 percent of
ASCAP-registered artists were tapped out as sample sources, including 
Roxette, Peaches & Herb, Bruce Hornsby, White Lion and Jon Secada. 

      Last Friday, the number of unsampled songs fell to two when rapper 
Master P paid $12 million for the rights to "Is It Love," the B-side to 
the 1986 Mr. Mister
hit "Broken Wings." 

      "This is an extremely serious situation," said Def Jam president 
Russell Simmons, whose label--which has featured such artists as Public 
Enemy, Beastie Boys,
EPMD, and LL Cool J--was responsible for much of the sample depletion of 
the mid- to late '80s. "Rappers may have to wait upwards of 10 years 
between
albums, until there's enough new pop songs to sample. Other than that, 
the only solution is for rappers to come up with the music themselves. 
Let's just hope it never
comes to that."

Sorry so off topic, anutha' tension breaker :)

*************************************************************

      WASHINGTON, DC--In the cable network's first-ever foray into the
home-video market, C-SPAN released Too Hot For C-SPAN! Tuesday. 

      The 60-minute, $19.95 videotape features what its packaging describes
as "wild and sexy congressional outtakes you won't see on basic cable." 

      "Sometimes, the action in the House and Senate gets a little out of
control, and footage must be held back from the general public," C-SPAN
spokesperson Larry Jainchill said. "But now, for the first time ever, you can
see it all. Too Hot For C-SPAN! is your front-row ticket to all the
outrageous, uncensored action." 

      In one typical segment, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) argues against the
passage of HR-4236, the Omnibus Parks And Public Lands Management Act,
calling it "a clear case of Republican pork-barrel politics gone awry."
Angered by Waxman's disparaging remarks, the bill's co-sponsor, Rep. James
Talent (R-MO) shouts at him, "That's it, bitch, I'm through with your ass,"
and charges the podium. He then tackles Waxman, pulling his hair and
punching him several times before a muscular congressional page pulls the
legislators apart. 

      In another segment, Sen. Bob Graham (D-FL), angered by Sen. Don
Nickles' (R-OK) call for a 1.3 percent increase in federal interstate
subsidies over the next five years, calls Nickles "a dumb Oklahoma hick who
can't get none of his shit approved in the Senate." Nickles responds by
calling Graham a "fat Florida fuck" and charges at him. As the livid Nickles
is dragged back to his seat by several Republican colleagues, he shouts at
Graham: "You just a temporary thang, Bob Graham.  Your ass gonna be voted
out of office this November. Me, I gots me a 83 percent approval rating in
my home district, so I ain't going nowhere--I'm forever, bitch!" 

      While a majority of Too Hot For C-SPAN!'s content is violent, it does
also contain a substantial amount of sexually explicit material. Just before
proposing an amendment to Sec. 11, Par. B of the the Hawkins-Taylor Clean
Water Act, Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) unbuttons her blouse, revealing her
breasts, and says, "My fellow members of Congress, it's all about the body." 

      Mikulski's actions were later denounced by Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun
(D-IL), who called them "grossly inappropriate and wholly unacceptable."
Moseley-Braun also said that Mikulski had "a fat pussy." 

      Among the other highlights listed in the Too Hot For C-SPAN! press
release: a "sassy catfight between Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Sen.
Susan Collins (R-ME)"; Sen. Alfonse D'Amato delivering "the filthiest
filibuster you've ever heard"; and a "massive bi-partisan pileup" between
the Senate Committee On Environment And Public Works and the Committee On
Banking, Housing And Urban Affairs concerning the rights of developers to
build in the same district as federally protected land. 

      "When John Chafee says he got it on with Paul Sarbanes' wife while
Sarbanes was off on a fact-finding mission to the Florida wetlands," the
press release states, "the gloves are off!"  

      Despite his excitement over the tape, C-SPAN's Jainchill did stress
that it is not intended for minors. "Due to its subcommittee melees,
profanity-laden roll calls, and wild catfights, Too Hot For C-SPAN! is
inappropriate for those under 18.  But for everyone else, believe me--you
won't want to miss a minute of the incredible gavel-to-gavel action." 

      "Aw, wicked," said longtime C-SPAN viewer Greg Ammons of La Jolla, CA,
when informed of the tape. "I love when they go at it on C-SPAN, and now I
can see all the really hot action and hear the really great insults without
those annoying 'Oops!' circles appearing over the mouths of the congressmen.
This tape is gonna rule." 

      Encouraged by the substantial pre-order sales for Too Hot For C-SPAN!,
C-SPAN is already going ahead with Too Hot For C-SPAN2! The second tape will
feature "incredible, totally uncensored" footage from C-SPAN's sister network,
C-SPAN2, including author Daniel Yergin's attempt to discuss his new book,
The Commanding Heights: The Battle Between Government And The Marketplace
That Is Remaking The Modern World, while a pair of 300-pound strippers
paints his body with chocolate sauce.

Does anyone know the Reebok DMX Technology commercial.  It starts with
some neat computer animated graphics and moves into a runner and then the
runner runs away.  I really love that song.  Is it a real song or just the
product of the advertiser's imagination?  I really want to dance to it!

Speed garage kicks too much ass for its own good and I don't really know
there's much else to say about it.  There are a lot of tracks coming out
that sound exactly the same, which is a problem, but there's still
plenty o' cool stuff being done.  In particular, *everyone* must hear The
Fabulous Baker Boys "Oh Boy" and Industry Standard's "What you want" which
are just top notch IMHO.  It would be nice if brit garage (particularly
the more vocally stuff) would find it's way over here a bit faster <sigh>

Don't mean to butt in since I'm still in Florida, but
speed garage tends to have elements of drum and bass
and elements of house together.  You normally have a
4X4 progressive club kick, but implement jungle
breaks on top of it.  Down here, JT, the only current
speed garager that I know, also plays a lot of tracks
that have time stretched samples.  These are the
things that give it away to me...

If you want to hear JT, he'll be mixing on my radio
show March 13th on Real Audio along with a bunch of
trance djs.  www.fau.edu/rpm/rpmshows has the front
of the ticket scanned, a link to our streaming real
audio file, and other stuff.

Cheers...

i just got this goofy little free english magazine from future sounds
"dedicated to the garage massive" (that's pronounced like "carraige",
mind you)... the garage scene in england seems to be focused to
classier heads. every club tries to advertise itself like: "we've got
the classiest dancers and the champagne is always flowing!". they've
all got dress codes (no trainers please!) and most of the pictures are
of people that are all decked out in some fashionable clothes. not
that this has ANYTHING at all to do with the music, just thought that
you might wanna know. 

also... what's up with sub-base giving up jungle and starting up that
garage label? that was pretty ill, esp cause sub-base is one a legend
as far as labels go. now they are re-releasing all of their ragga
backstock in a last attempt to make money off of the jungle scene.

<sigh>

yeah... i'd like to hear a really good speed garage dj. i'm not even
sure if i'd like it that much, but i'd like to at least give it a
chance on the dancefloor, you know?

OK this is not my opinion,I repeat NOT MY OPIONION, I am just relaying a
message called into me by a close friend who spun last night.

My close friend Dj Bizz from Houston Tx, played at the party last night and
called me from the Cleveland airport today as he was leaving for home.
These are his words, I'm just remembering them and typing them out.

He did not recieve his plane ticket untill yesterday morning, after calling
for the last week and getting no responses, or lies telling him that me
(sleepyC) was going to pick him up at the airport and drive him to Pitts.
(mind you I had no knowledge of this!!)
When he finally did get his ticket he quickly got to the airport and
boarded his plane. Half way to Cleveland Bizz realized that the promoters
had gotten him a ONE way TICKET!!
Upon arriving in Cleveland he was greeted by............. NOBODY!!

For two hours he sat there kind of waiting around, (unfortunatly I was not
home and could provide no assistance, Sorry dude!)

Finally a girl showed up and told Bizz that she was his ride to Pitts, but
she decided that she didn't want to go,  and tried to leave!!
Bizz made her stay, called the promoter and told him that if this girl
didn't get him to pitts he would freak. Mr. promoter dude convinced the
girl to drive him and Treavor Lamont who was now at the airport to Pitts.
(It's always nice to ride 2 1/2 hours with someone that dosent want to
drive you somewhere!)

So my boy (bizz) finally gets to Pitts (his first time there no less) and
what happens...
TOTAL UNORGANIZATION!!!

He said no one had a clue what was going on, and that there were like 250
people there. He tried to get paid from the promoter, and tried to find out
about his return plane ticket. The promoters got him to chill out after
alot of talking and negoating, but still no loot or plane ticket. Treavor
also help chill bizz.

Finally they paid him, but still no plane ticket, and the promoter didn't
have a car so he was basically stuck at the party.
Bizz said he had to be home today (due to work) and the promoters both
didn't do a thing. Bizz freaked and went vocal on him, got him to use his
mom's credit card and get him a flight home.
But guess what ... a flight from Cleveland not Pitts!!
The promoter had no car, so no ride for bizz,untill, finally they got him a
ride with as he said "3 Cracked out,  crystal meth freaks!"
He said the ride was scary to say the least.
He called me from the airport at about 4pm today, and said that he will
never go back to Pitts. again at least unles I recomended a promoter to
him! (way to go promoter guy!!)
Also, that it was the worst time he ever had at a party.
Also, that treavor was still stuck in Pitts!!! And he really needed to be
home for a family function or something! (hope ya got there treav!)

Now I'm just telling the list this because Bizz asked me to post this, and
I have known him for a long tome and played with him all over the US. He's
a cool guy and dosn't get mad easily, SO you can imagine how bad this party
must have been put together.

So I am starting to thing that the DEVER guy might have been in the right,
granted I really don't know him or have spun with him, so I can't  lean one
way or the other, but the unorganization of the show kind of slouches the
promoters creditability!

Once again from what Bizz told me, it was the same old story of the
Promoter not takin care of business.

Sorry to be the one to type this,
No personal disrespect to anyone, just relayin the message,
Sleepy C

ps. but if anyone does leave one of my friends stranded, I will hunt you
down and play kenny G records till your ears puke!!

AH!!!!!!!!!!!!  I feel for your friend!  I think thats totally FUCKED UP!
Whenever I do a Smart Bar I make practical "contracts" with people simply
becaue it there is a huge line to buy drinks all night, the people throwing
the party ask for "a percentage" instead of the price for a table!!!!!!!!!!!
Now, I have done percentages before with people that I've worked well with
but....to just change the game plans half way thru a party....thats wrong!!!!

I know how some of these "games" are played and I hope that your friend isn't
totally turned off by the Pittsburgh Area.  But I know if I was him....I would
be.  It's a real shame when people through parties simply for the
image..............

And people wonder why it's taken so long for "the scene" to gain
respect!!!!!!!!

Damn, that sucks hard too, cause I thought he was awesome. I loved his
music, his attitude, his mixing, everything... he kicked ass. He was one of
those DJs that really seem like he's getting into his set... etc... He must
have a hell of a personality to go up there and rock the house like he did
while in not too good of a mood. He had just about the whole place
dancing... (What's the label for the type of music he was playing?) Herm try
to convince him there ARE good promoters in PGH :)

If anything can instantly spell speed garage, it's the rolling jungly
basslines, even more so, I think than time stretching.

*Snow*Storm*

Well I ended up at this event at about 4:30/5:00, and the place was still a-
go. I was beginning to tire from the drive from Dayton. Well once I popped my
body into Snow Storm it immediately started to groove, and didn't stop..I was
so happy the floor was slick, I had been dancing on carpet earlier..don't get
me wrong I like to cut a rug, but not litterally..anyhow. The venue was great
expecailly the kitchen..it added a nice little touch that may never be
forgotten....I ran into some girl last night I met at Atomic this year (
another great event ) which made me really happy because she is so sweet. The
vibe was awesome!! People going out of their way to talk to you, people
dancing up beside you saying hello, smiles for miles...just when I start
getting frustrated w/ everything I end up somewhere great like Snow Storm. I
will quit babbling now..Im sorry for those who missed out on an awesome
affair!!

Love, Amy

my initial reaction to the 20/20 report on "our culture" last february was
a very lengthy post to this list examining the more serious side of
things, proposing some constructive ways to respond to the story's
one-sidedness, and asking some tough questions of the scene in the process
(it's in the mw-archives, i won't bother to re-hash my thoughts here).

now, the story has returned for a second appearance: unchanged and
unmitigated by the numerous comments they undoubtedly got from concerned
rave enthusiasts.  i myself never got around to writing my grand opus
against the piece, but i'm sure they must have gotten hundreds of negative
emails.  yet the story remained identical (from my understanding).  what
does that tell us?  is means they aren't listening, making the show's
usual closing comment "we're in touch, so you be in touch" seem utterly
hollow and empty.

so what can we do?  given the evidence above, the best approach for me has
been to just keep doing what i do.  if _they're_ not going to change just
because we've accused them of misrepresenting us, then by all means let's
ignore them and prove them wrong on the local level. 

case in point: the event we did this weekend occurred fully one day after
the report aired.  i feared some last-minute repercussions, as in: "we saw
that report on TV, we know what you're doing and we won't allow it!"  but
none of that happened.  there's no way i can be certain if anyone in the
neighborhood, or the space manager(s), ever even saw the report or
associated it with our party in any way.  but even if they did, they
didn't act on it.

when our hired special duty police officers showed up, i told them to
expect a few "stupid things" to be going on (ie, illicit drug use), but
that otherwise the crowd would be a well-behaved, low-alcohol bunch.  and
i was right.  there was one serious bust of a kid that was cutting acid in
the bathroom (more on him later), and a few polite sound complaints (due
to a buzzing window), but other than that, the officers just stood around
and made new friends. 

so if this is any indication, the 20/20 report will not be affecting what
i do very much.  and this night, we (meaning our cru as well as the party
people) did manage to prove 20/20 wrong.  it was about music, family,
experimentation, fun, dancing, and mind-expanding.  there _were_ drugs
there (i'm told ;) but we at least gave the _impression_ that it wasn't
about that.  and for that, i'm grateful.  gaining the trust and confidence
of even a few police officers is a definite step in the right direction
(well, at the sacrifice of that "edginess" of old-school illegal raves,
but hey...gotta move on).  we may not have the power of a multinational
mass media machine at my disposal, but we can stand for what we really
care about and hope that that purity can make a difference (gotta give a
shout out to mad mike of detroit's underground resistance at this point). 

now, back to that kid and the acid.  from what i understand, this kid got
caught prepping his stuff in the bathroom.  the arresting officers really
only stumbled on it by accident (i'm not too clear on the details), but
the end result is that a young kid who probably didn't know better will
now spend some hard time in jail (acid being a federal crime).  i don't
know about you, but my feelings go out to this kid.  i bet it never
occurred to him that he'd end up in such a dire predicament.  "i thought i
was just going to have a good time and make a little money."  it's a very
tough lesson to have to learn, and i hope it serves as a warning to anyone
out there who thinks raves can be open air drug markets. 

a more general warning: if you're stupid enough to be selling your wares
anywhere near the authorities, then you deserve whatever you get for
proving the 20/20 story and rave detractors RIGHT.  if you're selling, be
discreet.  if you're buying, buy from those you trust.  above all,
remember that this shit has some DEADLY serious consequences and ask
yourself if a one night "high" (from whatever substance: e, acid, heroin,
coke, meth, or money) is worth the risk of spending some quality time with
yourself and some unseemly strangers in jail.  i know i sound trite, and i
don't even do drugs myself, but i figured i can risk sounding like a
stodgy old curmudgeon because people already think i'm the self-proclaimed
missionary of the scene.  it's still an important thing to say. 

not that i'm against drugs, mind you.  use, not ABuse.  learn from them,
don't use them to escape from the world, or yourself (unless you plan on
returning :)

we can thank 20/20 for triggering so many of us to think about these
issues.  now all we have to do is go out there and actively convince those
people that matter (parents, authrotities, etc) that raving is a
multifaceted experience.  it's not all good, but maybe the good outweighs
the bad.  and in this world, that may be all we can ask...

yadda yadda yadda

> So did ANYONE go to this party?


i was there....

got there about midnight...had a really bad feeling about it as i walked
through the doors, cause ALL the building lights were on inside...it
just doesn't feel right y'know?...and since the party was supposed to
start at 10, i thought that maybe this was the way it was going to be
the entire night...i think they were still setting up the lights and
lasers or something; anyhow, the building lights went off about 10
minutes later...but it took about another 20 minutes for them to set up
the lasers...lights were pretty unimpressive overall...

the dj's were ok overall...a little sloppy here and there...but not bad
in general...

the sound setup was weird...the stacks of speakers were placed in the
middle right next to the railing seperating the wooden dance floor and
the rest of the place...the result was that if you danced on the wooden
floor, the music was slightly muffled sounding...

attendance was really lacking...place felt really empty...especially
compared to Biz...

ummmm...from what i wrote it might sound like i had a bad time...but i
actually had a good time despite the mediocre setting...

but definitely NOT worth the $15 for the advanced tickets...maybe $10 at
the door at most...

oh yeah, we actually had a little net meet of 4 people going...i got to
meet dan, spike, and dave chung...really nice guys...

I thought TV was a good party. I dont think it was worth 15$ pre and
definitly not $20 at the door. If I had not already bought pre I
probably would not have gone in since I showed up and the lights were
on. But I had already prebought and I had already walked from oakland :)
(If you passed and honked us (three of us) and I waved back, HI! )

Got there aound midnightish, maybe earlier, I was already spiked on
happy fun stuff so time was nonexistant. They turned out the lights by
hand (did someone not find the switch? Turning the bulbs.  They had two
sets of lights, (both were late) one set regular lasers that seemed to
only enjoy throwing out blue and white. Though it was interesting
watching them program them, heh.  Though I wasnt impressed. Actually
looking back on it I think their lasers were lacking red either on
purpose or by accident cuz even when they cycled through the spectrum
every so often all I could get a glimpse of was a deep orange, though
that could have just been my eyes. 

Now the other lasers were cool. They had a trace laser setup with a mesh
screen in the midle of the room so the laser played on the screen and on
the backwall. (thin screen) and it traced out deisigns. The geometrics
were cool, the advertisements were cheezy (though understandable) and I
thought the dancing kids deisngs were cute.  I would have thoughouly
enjoyed them if the lights from the other lasers hadnt been messing them
up.  The only problem was that it kept crashing.  As in the program was
running on 95 and they couldnt keep it up. (hehe, had to resist trying
to help but I go to raves to get away from day to day life :)

The music KICKED MOTHER FUCKING ASS imho.  Lots of house/garagehouse
(hey im finally learning the terms its always just been techno/rave to
me.) I was pumped with the speedy garage I was so jacked it had to be
uberfast just to be 'worth my while' (that was the trace in my head
anyway).  

All in all I think it was a good party, low turnout but that was
relaxing compared to how packed biz was, chatted with a few new faces
but dont remember any of the names.  Danced my ass of in my own little
way and ached the next day so I know it was good. Didnt exactly wanna
leave at 6am or so but I dreaded having to walk all that way back,
uphill, after dancing all night.


Question: Can anyone identify who it was that remixed foxy lady? Was
that the ned of the last set, or the begining of the next. Something
stole my soul in the music at that time and I just danced for 20 minutes
before I realized what I was doing, almost fell over with a heartattack.
 

I no longer fear that I lost my love for drugs and raves.  Just need
more of what they call house. :)

I'm still depressed at the lack of glowers though one guy there was
rockin ass and takin names.

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

I though this was wee bit strange...

I got to Snow*Storm pretty early, about 11 or so, and standing in line were
these four kids, wearing normal, non-raver street clothes, all holding
notebooks and looking uncomfortable.  I smiled at one of them, and that person
immediately whispered something to one of their friends.  Once inside, these
kids (I thought they looked about 17 or 18 years old) promptly took up standing
near the door and began taking notes.  I kept thinking, I wonder if these kids
might have been prompted by last night's 20/20 airing and decided to 'find out
for themselves,' or maybe they were doing a report for their school paper.  At
any rate, these kids totally alienated themselves from the entire room.  One
time, they split up and walked slowly around the room, taking notes as they
went.  By 1 o'clock they had left the party.  Every time I tried smiling at one
of these kids they just gave me a weird look and moved away from me -- and took
fucking notes.  If these people had been the least bit friendly they wouldn't
have bugged me at all, but I think the fact that they didn't try and talk to
anyone at all, if indeed they were there to produce some kind of 'report,' I
can only imagine what kind of things got recorded in those notebooks.

I just thought this seemed a little strange, since I have never seen people
doing anything like this before.

I don't know why the hell you would tell an officer such a thing.  It
sounds to me that these guys wouldn't have been *looking* to arrest anyone
if you hadn't tipped them off.  Whose side are you on anyway?  

I'm surprised that after doing as many parties as you have, you still
don't know the deal.  First of all, you only hire officers you can
control.  The deal is you *tell* them to flush drugs down the toilet, not
arrest people.  If you think that this policy of "flush or leave" is
omnipresent at other events, you are deadly wrong. Frankly, no one should
*ever* be arrested for drug possession or drug dealing at a party.  It's
the promoters responsibility to set the law with his security staff
first.  And if they don't comply, you hire others.

>From your other comments, it sounds like being buddies with the law is
more important to you than the well being of the attendees (ie the comment
about making friends with them). This is irresponsible.  We talk a lot
about the role of promoters in terms of music and lighting and ticket
prices.  But there are ethics too when it comes to hiring security.  We
have got to watch out for each other or it will all come tumbling down.

Yes, its primitive (should work on lynx), but its there.

TECHNOLOGY website [http://www.pitt.edu/~gmmst22/technology.htm]
chaos, futurism, beats.  

For those who don't know this is I little zine I'v been doing periodically
and distributing in the pittsburgh area.  Mostly just rave listings and
reviews of mixtapes, vinyl and events, with some cut-up art, rants and
make-it-yourself finger-puppets in the mix.  I try to focus on the
positive and creativ and futuristic stuff, but really its more an anything
goes ticket.  The website is still in development, and the new paper issue
WILL (i promise) be out in the next week.  Check it out, let me know
what'cha think, send me reviews and i'll credicha'.

agreed. i cant argue that the presence of e does add something to a party
(all those free hugs!) but i have always felt that any state that can be
attained chemically can also be reached through alternate means. at the
risk of self-righteoiusness, let the music be a drug! seriously, when im
dancing (sober) the world disappears and it me and the speaker, a musical
infection. i understand that sometimes drugs are felt necessary to reach
this point but theyre not. its a gateway kinda thing: if you do substances
to get you somewhere, figure out where that is then try to get back there
on your own. i have a whole nother tangent here about yoga and meditation
but ill spare y'all for now. just know that its possibel to feel more
fukked up off the vybe than on any kinda pill. like my mom said, the
lights and sound and ppl are so intense and overwhelming, is it really
necessary to ingest to feel like youre in another world? my moms a pretty
intelligent woman, btw :)

sorry if this ran a little preachy, these are issues i feel very strongly
about. im not saying dont use drugs theyre bad. no. everything is and
experience, and if you can derive something from it, maybe learning,
there's nothing bad about it (good and bad are just two sides of a
dichotomy anyhoo.) but maybe if youve never tried it, check out a really
good party sober with an open mind. youll only get into it as much as you
let yourself, which may be why i go absolutely fukkin nuts sometimes :P

kay, jes, enuff lecturing. dance makes everything better :)

groove on!

i so agree with you ... i totally know what you're talking about, i
thought the same thing when i saw the commercial.  they should put it out
on viynl, i think it would have lots of possiblities ... 

also i've seen a commercial for skechers shoesthat has the dopest
liquid/acid sound i've heard for a long time ... but i'm pretty sure they
are both produced by ppl hired by the advertising agency.

duh sorry i am not explaining myself very well. what i mean is to me it is 
people's own business + choice if they are doing drugs unless it is
affecting me in a negative way. if it isn't then i really don't care what
they do.

skinner and dom played.  i can't recall any impressions of skinner, but i
remember how i felt when dominik came on ...

i was disappointed at first, cos my body felt like it had just peaked
dancing to the instigator's mad set (dropping bombs as always) and i can't
dance to hardcore.  but once i took a listen, i realized that this kid has
crazy skills, real quick hands, and he knew the records well.  he was sooo
fast, i was freaking out cos he knew exactly where to catch the vinyl
without having to skip along, he would just putt he needle to the record,
match, and mix ... what he did just playing with the crossfader was
amazing.  also i thot the mix of hardcore, jungle and trip-hop was
creative.  i couldn't dance to to it, but i really enjoyed listening to
him.  

my opinion.

i like speed gair-edge i think...

the biggest complaint is alot of the songs sound similiar (hehe "all jungle
sounds the same")...rolling, or bouncy bassline, timestretched vocals, etc
...i'd say sugar daddy by cj bolland is def. speed garage, and prolly spin spin
sugar too...

i like the tempo, i like the breaks in it, not all 4/4, its *fun* to dance
to...silly music, so all you pretentious intelligent types wont like it. ;)
imagine that...music, at a *party*, that tries to make the statement.."its
ok to dance and have fun"...what a novel concept...;)


i heard a dj this weekend drop the best speed garage set i've heard to
date.

dj bizz.

whoa. where'd this guy come from? good skills, good selection, great
flow...steve, give him my props.

term. velocity review:

i went to this party *knowing* that dever, skinner, and dv8 weren't going
to be there...knew this as fact. and they werent there. apparently some of
the crew involved with t.v. either didn't know this or outright lied to
many peoples faces...

i dont want to talk alot of shit...but when i got there with dominik around
11:30, i was surprised...infoline said party started at 9:30...got there
and there were like 50-100 kids sitting about and all the lights were on,
and kay (kali) the hardcore diva was at the decks...the first thing dominik
said was 'oh my god, marilyn manson is spinning' (it was his first
encounter with kay (aka the turkey lady)

we (me and 3 friends from toronto who came down with dominik) left at like
12:30, and came back at 3 (dominik went on at 3:30).  so i cant comment on
what went on while i was gone, if dv8 played, it was while i was away...i 
think trevor/instigator was playing when we came in.

dom started his set out with the method man and redman acapella that had
all the lines sampled in jungle tracks '6 million ways to die' 'the funk
phenomenon', etc...that was pretty dope.

he spun a nice mix of hardcore (at like 170-180, not gabber) and old school
jungle...it was a pretty good set overall, but i think the crowd couldnt
handle it.  a floor that was filled during the first 3 songs thinned out as
he went on, but he brought them back when he dropped tracks like acen's
'trip to the moon II' :)  skill wise he's on...he uses the crossfader well,
cutting back and forth very cleanly...it was my first time hearing him, im
looking forward to catching him again in the future...


after that was bizz who thoroughly rocked the spot...big up your chest bizz
:) total surprise, didnt know him from adam, but he turned it out...he spun
from like 4:30-5:30 give or take...if you didnt know what speed garage was
before his set...you had no doubt by the end.


<i think john/product 19 spun next, but im not sure, he may have spun after
bizz? maybe he did? not sure ;) >


then trevor lamont came on and i was expecting a deeeeep, groovy house set
for that time of morning, but he seemed to want to keep up with the acidy
sound that was common that nite (thats why i think product 19 spun after
bizz)..he spun really acidy/hard house...not what i  was hoping for...but
thats just me...trevor's still got the skills :)

then i think chris/xl spun...he dropped some bad ass older jungle toons,
which put a smile on my face and had me dancing hard...then he stretched
out a mix into bass 2 dark for waaaaay too long, like he had a nice peak
going, and kept drawing it out...ended up watering down the effect...never
really got into it after that, but it was still nice to hear hard ass
jungle at like 7am ;)

we all left after that, went back to my house, and time just drifted
by...the torontonians left around 1pm...

did i have a good time at the party? yes.

was the party unorganized? organization def. could have been better.

honestly, most of you should have known what was in store before this
party...drama central, and even those of you compeltely cut off should have
raised eyebrows at the whole dever thing...a promoter's reputation isnt a
hard thing to find out..ask around.

you should have stayed home if u had bad vibes. if u went and thought it
sucked or wasnt worth the money, you should have *talked* to the promoter.
dont bitch about it after the fact/behind backs.

support good promoters by paying money to attend their events. it's simple.

bitching and moaning and complaining after the fact/spreading rumors are 
much less effective.

funny how i still can go to a shitty party and still manage to enjoy myself
5 years after i started going out....can't have anything to do with
*wanting* to have a good time and being with like-minded friends, could it?


peace,
hossam

"also... what's up with sub-base giving up jungle and starting up that
garage label? that was pretty ill, esp cause sub-base is one a legend
as far as labels go. now they are re-releasing all of their ragga
backstock in a last attempt to make money off of the jungle scene"

================

frankie...its my understanding that subbase didnt drop jungle...they merely
added a sublabel...'quench' for garage (house) music...

check out www.subbase.com for the real story. as for re-relasing back
stock...good for them. why not make money off it? two sides to this story:
the artists deserve to profit from their hard work...there's a hell of alot
more poor artists/musicians than rich ones -- and also, dan donnelly has
never shied away from getting paid, i remember back in like '94 everyone
was bitching that all the subbase artists drove fancy sports cars, so they
were 'sellouts'...then goldie gets a 1 million pound ad campaign for
timeless (and bigger im sure for saturnz return) and everyone hails him as
god. at the end of the day, everyone should be compensated for their work.

tho, i just remember going to the back room after dom's set and thinking,
hey this dj is creative.

i just wanna say that i had fun at terminal velocity.  i heard from the
promoters that it was supposed to be a two-room event at a virgin venue
with 80k watts of four-corner sound.  even tho it was held in a one-room,
overused venue, with about 1/2 the promised sound, and i had just
witnessed the promoter succumb to an unprofessional flame war - in public
- i still had fun.  and i had the impression that most other pps were
having fun too.

smiles,
spyboy david

i just saw that yesterday for the 1st time. why doesn't reebok call it
<<<DXM>>> technology? it would be totally appropriate, since the name
would match the commercial. ;) dmx probably doesn't stand for anything
anyway. i need to tape that commercial onto my video tape of assorted eye
candy. =D did anybody else see that "back in the day" documentary on mtv
with top 10 videos? that's why i was watching tv. it sucked that out of
probably 30 people interviewed, only about 3 of them were DJs. i remember
they had grandmaster flash, spinderella, and dj hurricane. everybody else
was MCs, and a few producers, breakdancers, etc. there was very little
footage of DJs and breakdancers, about 5-10 minutes total out of an hour
long show, and absolutely nothing about graffiti writers, an integral part
of hip-hop. a good deal of people feeding their egos, bragging, etc. at
least 10 minutes of talk about fashion, which of course shouldn't be
ignored, but spending more time talking about fashion than about DJing is
pretty dumb. in the top 10 "old school" videos, all but the top 2, the
message =] and rapper's delight (which wasn't even shown in full, what's
up with that?) were made in 87 or after. it was more like the top 10
videos of the very end of the old school. i wanted to hear stuff like
magic's wand, jam on it, etc. =] well at least mtv has bought a small
fraction of a clue in showing that program.

can anybody id this song? it's like gospel house or something + kind of 
old i think (1987). the chorus has this part that goes "it's hard to let
you go" + it was sampled in some moby song (bring back my happiness i
think). the other words i can remember out of it go "the only time you
ever come around is every time some girl has put you down" and "loving 
you was my mistake, losing you you know i just can't take, then one
time when it's too late, then you'll be running, running, running after
me". i got this tape with it from a friend last week + i've listened to
that song about 6 times, it makes me so happy. he said a friend of his
made it in chicago in 87. the other side says it's by "chicago's bad boys"
and it has this gospel house song that goes "catch me on the rebound",
does anybody know what that one is too?

ok....so i went to the party skeptical due to the rumor mill.....didn't 
buy advance tix because i wanted to make sure that it would actually be 
happening before i spent any money.....

...and so the night begins....the flyer said start time was 9:30...we 
get there around 11:15, and the lights are still on....um, ok...we hang 
out and then take off.....seeing as how there was no vendor for water, 
we make a point to visit the local mini-mart and get some while we're 
out.....and we hope that there are more people there when we get back...

no such luck..get back to the irish center around 12:45, and there's 
still nobody there (sad state of affairs)....couldn't tell you who was  
spinning, but it was decent enough to make me start dancing....next dj, 
eh, he was good, but not my thing i guess....seeing as how i was sober 
and tired, i took a nap :P
the instigator was next, and, as usual, laid down a good set.  never 
fails.  nice to have something real on a night when there is so much in 
question.....

so it's 3:30, there's still no one there (_deplorable_ attendance) and 
it's dominick's turn.  made my whole night.  totally new for me (i 
know...where the hell have i been?) and it was just amazing.
danced _hard_ for like and hour.  needed another nap :)

after that...i don't remember much...just music....(sorry, i was tired!)  
we left around 6 or so....

other comments....the whole promotion and whatever was SHADY to say the 
very least....dj's who were booked weren't on the flyer, dj's who 
weren't booked were on the flyer, dj's who were booked got treated 
poorly (understatement :P).....at 11:15, they were still setting up?  
what's up with that?....the LARGE amount of people who were on 
something, kinda thought it was a drug party, not a rave....the low 
attendance....

but wait...i'm getting all negative...truth is, i had a lot of fun...met 
a bunch of people....got hugs, backrubs, the whole bit....and i got to 
dance which is the most important part.....

not going to say that i won't ever go to a party by the same promoter 
just because i had a good time....but i will say that $20 was expensive 
considering what we got....my advice would be get your shit 
together.....


nonsensical as always...


k bye =)
erika

That is a fucking bitch for your friend, but its funny as hell to those
who have been watching this flame war about reputations and shit.

I guess the moral ot the story is:
you can talk a lot of shit, but when it comes to the big day can you pull
it off?

I'd like to hear what Stickman has to say to defend his reputation . . .

OK, so what's the deal?  Can someone explain to me why all this shit
happened (no new venue, all sorts of djs not showing up)?  Hossam: are
you saying that stickman is a good promoter or a bad one (I couldn't tell
from your post)?

I'm soooo sick of people saying they have a 100% secure virgin space that
is "going to have insta-vibes" and all sorts of shit and then have
nothing come of it.  Maybe Stickman had some problems or something, but
why say the site was 100% confirmed and safe and all that jazz if it
isn't?  I mean I posted something about thinking it was going to be at
Wash. county fairgrounds and got a flame from stickman saying how stupid
I was to think it would be there and how the site was going to be the
shit . . . and then its at the Irish Centre.

That's interesting he played hard shit, cause the only time I've seen him

dark.  That song is wicked.

a police officers job for enforcing the law...and last time i checked it

be more lax, but hiring police officers will ensure yur party will not
get busted...i prefer tighter security opposed to coming to a party dance
for about 2 hours and then having to go home after paying $15-$20 becuz
the party got busted...atleast the officers didn't stop the party due to
all the drugs!...

<<From your other comments, it sounds like being buddies with the law is
more important to you than the well being of the attendees (ie the comment

about the role of promoters in terms of music and lighting and ticket
prices.  But there are ethics too when it comes to hiring security.  We
have got to watch out for each other or it will all come tumbling down. >>

this statement is way outta line braden, this really irks me cuz i know
u, and i thought u knew ed too...i really don't think ed was out to be
buddies with the law or that he holds them in higher regard than his
own patrons (i think i do mean patrons this time!)...he was simply 
trying to ensure the best quality party...and if hiring officers would
ensure a more bust free party, then he made the right choice...

my only regret was getting there so late...we hit two partys that night
...one in dayton even...and half our cru was too pooped after the dayton
party to make it to snow*storm...they really missed out cuz snow*storm
wuz da bomb-diggy party!...we would've skipped the dayton party entirely
if we knew dat it wasn't an all jungle party earlier (stevie still can't
dance to jungle!)...the party was worth it just to see jason dancin in dat
small ass kitchen that ed & tony were spinnin in...it wuz funny as shit
cuz they had the tables set in the corner right between the kitchen sink
& the oven!...and ed his set accordingly with depeche mode's "enjoy the

Umm... excuse me, but wasn't a party shut down recently in the
pb-cle area because some kid had a seizure?  

Hello?!

If people are endangering their lives around you, then it _is_
affecting you in a negative way.  

> if it isn't then i really don't care what they do.

Sound to me like you should scratch the words before "i" and after
"care".

"Fuck yourselves up but don't fuck with me" is a pretty poor
attitude, in my opinion.  A line must be drawn somewhere.

well... *actually* ;)
my uncle is a cleveland cop.. a detective.. he even helped catch the BVD
bandit (hehe).. he's 40 something..
everytime he sees me he has new 'questions' for me to 'get in touch with
the youth generation'
lately he keeps asking about these 'raves'  and what goes on at them..
he's fairly clueless about this... and i'm guessing many more cops are...
pretty amusing :P

	that's my point. im not saying either way. i think rick deep down
has his heart in the right place...but until you actually throw a party,
and know *all* the details involved, it's real easy to bitch about a
promoter and how bad their party was.

	it's really easy to say we should have such and such kinds of
parties in pittsburgh. now go out and do it. i'll give rick credit for
actually attempting to do something.


	now, i *will* be fair and say that there's some ppl that say no
effort is better than a bad/negative effort. and i'll agree to that.

	what really killed me was when i got there at 11:30 and i saw *all*
these really young kids just standing around looking lost. it was obvious
that it was the first party for many of them. and i feel bad thats the
image they walked away from...lights on, shabby organization two hours
after the scheduled start time, no water, which is a HORRIBLE oversight.
hoepfully they will persevere and go again and have a great 2nd experience.

	(what really killed me was when i saw a syringe and vial of k
floating in the toilet around 4am...later on, it was gone, but it was a
disgusting sight)

	more often than not, there has been a bit of drama and uncertainty
surrounding rick's parties...if you go in prepared, thats half the battle.
if you're not up for it, the best thing u can do is stay at home.

	
	i'll admit, i didnt pay to get in. ok fine. objectively tho...i
think that was a $10 adv. $15 door party...MAX. esp with 3 headliners
cancelling.
	

	i mean the facts are pretty clear and they speak for
themselves...what was promised and what was delivered? why werent flyers
out sooner? etc. etc...make up your own minds, its not for me to say who's
a "good" and "bad" promoter.

	
	i have no idea why the venue was changed, to be honest, im kinda
glad it was at the irish center...coz if some shit had gone down, and the
party got busted, thatd be the end of the 'dope new space with
instavibe'...at least with the irish center, you know what u are getting.

	i dunno. im torn b/w ppl who (not you todd, chill :) say shit like
"someone should throw a party" and then bitching about it...if you think
you can do better..go for it. 

fyi, i know rick made less than $100 and that was before he had to
arrange for bizz and trevor's transportation home. (i dont know WHAT the
fuck was up with that...and as a general rule, round trip tickets are
*cehaper* than one way flights...and your dj's appreciate having a way to
get back *HOME*...rick, u either need to watch your details more
closely, or put ppl who can handle the responsibility on the case...i don't
think i'd have the ppl in that back room running things for me.)

	*and* then on top of all that, they bitch about promoters making
money off their events?


but then we get what steve was talking about: kids who 'borrow money from 
their parents' and make mad cash on a shitty party...



	throwing/promoting parties is one of the most thankless professions
ever (right guys? :) i mean months of hardwork get you an evening of making
ppl happy and a few bucks in your pocket if you are lucky.


	im looking at it from both sides of the fence here i guess.


	i dont throw parties anymore. the profit/loss ratio sucks. scj is
enuff of a headache as it is. *if* i threw another party, i'd make sure it
was tight. i wouldn't go for the 'everything will be all right' approach.
but since i'm not the one out there putting my ass on the line (anymore) i
try and give the promoter the benefit of the doubt..for at least making the
effort. i really wish all promoters took things on a more professional
level tho..respect to those of you that do.

	
peace,
hossam


ps- any of those of you who think im a hypocritical wishy washy bastard,
email me. ill try and explain my two viewpoints better.

pps- the next house of styles party in march looks dope...green velvet,
stryke, dave trance, gavin hardkiss, etc. etc. (*psst* i hear its gonna be
at a brand new virgin space ;)

to the person who said that "no one" should ever be arrested for drugs at a
party (i thin kit was braden?)


consider this:

a town where the only way to make sure you dont have your party busted is
to hire off duty policemen.

the promoter tells the COP that he doesnt want kids being arrested for
drugs? off duty cops still have a duty to uphold the law when they see it
violated. ok, so he tells the cop don't arrest the kids, just kick them
out...the cop says 'sorry i cant do that' the promoter tells the cop that
hes going to go with another private security firm. 

Q: What are the chances this party will get viisited by 5-0 and definitely
hassled hardcore?

A: 99%. short of having a lawyer at the door to greet the cops, you're
gonna be fucked...cause you just told them that there were going ot be
drugs there. 

In my opinion, being upfront with your security is the best way to
go...outlining your policies in advance; so they arent taken aback *if*
there are drug issues.

Your liability ends when u put "NO DRUGS ALLOWED" on the flyer. the dealers
take the risk upon themselves...parties arent some happyfairydreamland (to
paraphrase homer simpson) where everything goes.


here's a nickel...keep the change :)

ugh.  i really don't want to get involved in the hesed shesed, i'm only
posting this cos everyone seems curious about what happened.  personally i
don't like to get so involved, i just go to parties ...

i thot the absence of speakers in the back of the hall created a sloppy
sound, but it was not a big deal, so i smilingly suggested to stickman
that if he use the space again that he stick to four corners.  he said he
didn't have enough time to get that going.  and that's fine with me.

I think someone should throw a party that is entirely devoted to silliness
and childhood.  I realize that some people can't stand candy ravers, but
you can't be serious all the time.  Sometimes you have to cut loose and
laugh, even if it's AT the candy ravers.

There should be only djs that will spin only fun fun silly willy music.

I've been doing raves since '93 and I should hope that something like that
would never happen. 

You'd think you'd be able to get it right by now.

If that's speed garage I definatly liked it.

so...

Is that the chick that dances with the flashlights that are like the ones

Yep, I'd like to see more of him... He really did put on a great show, mixed
well, nice scratching, and played great tunes... I dont think you could
complain about him in any way. He's about the best I've seen I think.
(although I havnt seen much) I'm ready to bear his children.

yeah me too :)

hi.

as someone who works in advertising i can say that while it is true that 
a 
lot of music heard in commercials is produced specifically for that 
product,
it is equally as common that a pre-produced track could be licensed for 
commercial use.  

in my experience, music that is composed specifically for a commercial 
is
generally not as hip as those that are licensed (although this is a 
generalization).  also when dealing with a genre like techno or 
'electronica'
it would probably be less expensive to take a pre-existing track and 
license it rather than have one composed for exclusive commercial use.

but then again, we're talking about some pretty big companies with 
pretty big budgets, so you just can't tell unless you know the track or 
its origin.

so thanks for letting me waste your time and share nothing really all 
that
enlightening with the group.  always glad to help.  =P

peace
solarvibe =)

I love Kay to death.  She was at my first party and at a lot of others.
She came to my birthday party.  She's taken pictures of me.  

I honestly believe that she embodies the raver spirit!  She IS peace love
unity respect.  She's always happy.  She only wants to dance and she could
give a flying fuck who cares what she looks like.  She may be the most
encouraging raver in the entire Pittsburgh scene.  She knows all kinds of
crazy things about songs and samples and she spins, too.  I think there
should be a party in honor of Kay.  I love Kay!!

So how does one go about finding out whether or not it's a pre-existing
track or not?  I mean do you call the Reebok company and say,"Hey, what's
that track on that commercial?"

Regarding DMX technology, this is Reebok's new line of "prestigious" footwear.
These shoes are supposed to be at a higher level than any of the other Reebok
shoes. Adidas also has a similar line of shoes called Adidas Equipment. If you
noticed the logo is different than the original leaf-like logo. These are
supposed to be a better quality than the others. Also Nike is developing a line
called "Alpha" which will have an 3-elipse logo and will first start with the
swoosh, but once they are recognized will eventually drop the swoosh logo.

As for music in commercials, did anyone see the commercial for Micheline tires?
It featured Carl Lewis jumping from building to building in New York City, and
eventually landing on the Statue of Liberty. And on his foot is tire treads.
Well the digital track playing was developed by Richard James, aka Aphex Twin,
Polygon Window, etc. It was a pretty dope track.

Here here!  Kay is one of the few really hardcore ravers out there that
still has the oldskool ravin' spirit!  :) Many smiles and big-ups to Kay
and the hardcore goddess kali. :)

She was at my first party too, and as i hear, just about every rave that's
ever been thrown in pittsburgh.

well i was in there taking a piss when the 5-0 wandered in.  i saw the
cops headed towards the pisser looking at ppl so i said to "be careful"
and i dunno if the kid heard me.  guess not.  anyhoo the cops came in,
watched me pee and stuck their noses into the stall (which had _no_ door)
and then busted the kid.  i bee-lined outta there, coz i didnt want to get
caught in the middle and there was nothing i wanted to see....  well
actually considering the things i read from cop-watch, maybe there
would've been a show now that i think of it ;)

Hehehehehe...The letters DXM most certainly do stand for something. See:

http://www.frognet.net/dxm

It's an over the counter drug that will fuck you up without a doubt,
generally
gotten in Robitussin or Vicks 44. That FAQ is the most complete I have
ever seen on any subject. I would bet that they didn't call the shoes
DXM
just because anyone doing a net search would definitely run into all of
the
sites relating to this drug.

Are you against skydiving or mountain climbing? If you don't
do these things, would you try to keep other people from doing
them because they can be dangerous?

As they say, opinions vary. And by the way, who is it up to

fairgrounds in the fall of '95...i always wondered who she was...

did anyone here go to boom? so much has happened to me since then that i
don't really remember it...except i think that was the first time i had

As Craig pointed out earlier, I think we have reached an impasse in this
discussion. The point at which we currently reside has become a question of
morality, a question of ethics. It seems as though we have stumbled upon a 
fundamental and highly important philosophical question: That is to say,
what is the line between good and evil, ethical and unethical, WHAT is this
line, WHO draws it, and for WHOM does it apply, and under what CONDITIONS
(if any)? If we are to adopt the idea that there is no universal truth,
that in fact there is NO line to be drawn, we are faced with the problem of
an "anything goes" mentality. While there are good aspects of this such as
respect and tolerance, it is problematic in that this relativistic and
subjective view gives us an ambiguous context in which to make decisions or
judgments, and it implies that we will all have to respect even the views
that we do not like, views that may in fact hurt others. (For a very
general example, take the views of the Neo-Nazi movement: anti-semitism,
racism, sexism, and dominance of those deemed "weak" and "impure"---or
you can impose this on the subject of drug use). (Another thought is
whether or not there is a middle ground between these two views.)

Craig brought this subject up in an earlier post in which
he appealed for a intelligent discussion that would serve to formulate
converging (or diverging) working definitions,  a starting point for this
dialogue.  I think that these are very important issues that we all need to
be thinking about, and I would like to thank everyone who has participated
in helping me to think more about them, specifically over the last few
weeks or so, Craig, Ed, Braden, MCRod, and some others that I may have
forgotten. I have not come up with any of my ow definitive answers to any
of these questions, but I know that this list has helped me to begin to
formulate my own beliefs stemming from a theoretical basis about the
ethics of drug use. Because I believe that these questions are in fact
very pertinent to the direction in which the rave scene has and is
proceeding, I hope that others on this list are also being critical of
their own beliefs, the rationality of these beliefs, and the way in which
they apply not only to our own lives, but to the lives of others.

Much simpler...

Ok, what numbers are missing in the original sequence? These:

1 3 7 12 18 26 35 45 56 69 83 98 114 131 150
(3-1)     = 2
(7-3)     = 4
(12-7)    = 5
(18-12)   = 6
(26-18)   = 8
etc.

          ^ this line of numbers combined with the first line gives...

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8....

Get it? As I said to someone else, maybe it's just trippy to me.

think) back than!  Christopher Lawrence's set was one of the most
inspiring I'v ever heard...i'm talkin' orgasmic uplifting trance.  I think
i drank 2 gallons of water that nite.  Damn, that one was a 4 badgers of
the apocalypse quality rave.  Sadly, I was hoping to hear deiselboy that
night, but i got there right after his set...ah...memories. :)

Boom! was my second party.  It was the first time I met the man with the
smartdrinks, Jason.  I went alone and it was kinda creepy at first.  Then
I met some ravers that used to be at almost every party I was at.  Wasn't
that one of the last UDG inc. parties?  From what I hear, UDG inc.  was
the absolute bomb!  Didn't they do the party at the museum?  I almost went
to that, it would've predated my first party by more than three months, if
I remember correctly.  Boy, those were the days (hey, isn't that a song?).

yours truly,
the saddest, reminiscent raver

How about a 'rave' where all the music isn't even rave music?  Have djs
spinn reggae, mid-80's hardcore, banjo music playing the tunes of Mariah
Carey, squaredance licks, and of course Japanese classical music.  All the
lights, lazers and sound-system the same.  I can just see the whistle
posse going' wild to some phat tuba sounds.  

Its all about the vibe anyway, isn't it? :)

			nice & smooth mailing list v2.1

Yes!  We're back ... the first e-newsletter from nice+smooth for '98 !

The past six months have been incredible.  In summary, we've upgraded the
studio, released several new albums, had a number of great shows (as well
as putting on several more in the coming months)... all the while, steadily
working on a number of new tunes, tracks and grooves...

Following are some highlights from the past few months...

--------------------------------------------------------------
				Shift-ing 
--------------------------------------------------------------

So, who's the most influential and exciting innovators in today's new music
industry?  According to the March 1998 issue of Shift Magazine (Canada's
new media bible), nice+smooth's Kinder Atom have been chosen to be among
the top 25 most important people in the Canadian new music scene, "shaping
one of the most vibrant new music scenes in the world !"

According to the cover story, the magazine "polled musicians, critics,
sound engineers, music mavens, promoters and various other industry types
across the country to get their selections based on three criteria :
influence, innovation and success."

Among the top 25 people/bands/acts, ranging from Our Lady Peace to Richie
Hawtin, The Tragically Hip to Sarah McLachlan - Kinder Atom were selected
for :

"In a country not exactly known for its ambient and drum 'n bass acts,
Kinder Atom stands out as the likeliest group to change this image.  Within
five years, they've released two albums, participated in many remixes and
compilations and released Metro Breaks, Toronto's first drum 'n bass
collection !"

Wow... thanks Shift !


	--------------------------------------------------------------
					Metro Breaks Out !
	--------------------------------------------------------------

Title 		: Metro Breaks - Selected Drum & Bass from Toronto
Format		: CD and Double Vinyl
Cat #'s	: Canada [KOCH/TJSB (TJS-CD 034)]
		: USA and International 	[Hypnotic (CLP 0127-2) CD
						[Hypnotic (CLP 0127-1) Vinylx2

After nearly a year of sourcing, compiling and mastering - Metro Breaks has
hit stores everywhere.  This leading edge drum & bass compilation covers
all styles from tech-step to dubby hip-hop and ambient atmospherics.  It
features an all-star cast of DJ's and electronic musicians all hailing from
Toronto, unquestionably the capital of North America's drum and bass scene.

"From the dancefloor jump-up of  Visionary to the experimental sitar and
breakbeats of  Stereofreeze, the dark techstep of Kinder Atom vs. Nemesis
to the loungey vibes of Dave Howard and Auracle, this sampler has all the
bases covered..."

				- Greg Clow, Chart Magazine/CIUT fm

Taken from Metro Breaks liner notes....

"Metropolitan Toronto was the first beach head for jungle in North America.
 The biggest city in Canada has been down with the sound since the days of
hardcore in 1992 when the original junglists like Goldie's Rufige Cru,
Jumping Jack Frost, DJ Phantasy and Nicky Blackmarket appeared at area
parties. The steady stream of big name junglists to Toronto raves attracted
the attention of UK dance music journals like Mixmag and The Face in 1994
and the buzz was confirmed.

Local DJs were also passed the breakbeat torch by ex patriot British DJs Dr
No and Malik X, who moved here and spread the word of labels like Shut Up &
Dance and Reinforced at clubs and on college radio.

But the question has been: when will Toronto express it's version of drum &
bass? There has been talk of various jocks and producers making recordings
but only a handful of tracks have seen the light of release. Now Metro
Breaks is here to confirm the rumors and to complete the circle of
inspiration and cut creation. You supply the lighter."

		- Chris Twomey, Exclaim Magazine.

By the way frum rumors I heard Carlos is spinnin afterhours for
DETONATION.Anyone know if this is true??Also does anyone know if its true
CyberX is at the dirty ass boat storage?And is it true DETONATION is at the
skate place?I'd really like to know so I can decide which party gets my hard
earned money.But more than likely I'll support the Ohio kids.Seein how the
last time Detroit threw a party here (that jungle sky tour) it was way
overpriced.Any info to help me decide would be appreciated.THANKS

I thought I'd just jump in here for a second. You're right it is quite
possible that the track was licensed however a great many big corporations
have hired producers in the scene to do music. Remember the Frutopia
commercials a couple years back, or the Levis commercials last year.
Recently I was asked to write a very specific piece for a large corporation
that sells consumer audio equipment. So if you see a commercial for a
consumer grade CD recorder and it has jungle in it and scenes in the rain
then that would be  my little 30 second song I made specifically for that
corporation.

I totally agree!  Kay is the greatest.  She was at the first party I ever
went to and when I got my brother going, she was the first person I
introduced him to.  She _is_ the embodiment of raves.  Go on girl!

  it took me many hours before i found myself able to dance
  (at terminal velocity), and so i spent some time right in
  the middle of the room (ample space) meditating, and just
  trying to feel the music.  i guess i mustve looked a tiny
  bit disturbing, eyes closed and breathing slowed and all.
  kay was the first of three people to come up to me to ask
  if i were alright.  she was so sweet and considerate.  it
  made me really happy.  there were not many people around,
  but the positive energy was flowing.  it just took a tiny
  bit longer than normal to find it.  so in the end i found
  what i was searching for and danced joyously.  besides, i
  didnt want to keep worrying everyone into thinking that i
  were on a hideous chemical rollercoaster.

  my brief review of the party, well, it was quite far from
  perfect, as has been already stated.  but, its the people
  who change a party into a rave, and we ravers did.  (: -s

this is all so surreal. i recognized kay on the first pittsburgh rave i
went to. it was in 1995.  she wore spandex and took a picture of the
deejay. it was pretty dark though, i dont know if it'd come out. i noticed
she was older than everybody else.

I first saw K at PowerRave 92-- she was dressed in gogo boots, a pink
miniskirt and a blonde yellow wig.  I used to give her shoutouts on flyers
that I worked on.  She's even billed on Turbo-Zen's Driving Current flyer
(remember the parties thrown at Kurt's Garage?!?);  "Personal Lights by
K."

She's been at just about every party i've been to in Pittsburgh since 92,
she's the most pure representation of a true 'raver' (major stereotypes
aside) is, and hahaha she owes me a few mixtapes...

I wasn't at Terminal Velocity, but anyone who managed to catch her set
most likely heard some of the very same records that put
Pittsburgh's underground on the map. :)

and in a way K is a mental landmark that symbolized a whole new world for
me of breaking down barriers, fucking the system up and feeling good.  and
i was sixteen at the time.

well, you'd have to get in touch with reebok's marketing department and 
ask them who produced the commercial.  they will probably direct you to 
an ad agency who will be able to tell you if they're not in a pissy mood 
that day.

good luck.

Subject: submissions wanted


A group of us here in Iowa are currently working on developing a
new Midwest based magazine devoted to popular youth (specifically raver)
culture.  We are looking for anyone who would be interested in submitting
reviews of recent parties for inclusion in the first issue of our mag.  

What we need is as follows:

	The Name of the event
	Date/city
	promoter
	a short description of the space
	how were the dj's?
	How well did the party go off in general?
	Your overall impression of the event

Anyone who is interested, or just has questions, please contact me at
mseeman@uiowa.edu

If your submission is used, we'll send you a free copy of the magazine and
maybe some stickers or stuff.  

Thank you,
	Matt (editor Hardstep Magazine)

PS.  We are also looking for anyone who has short fiction, art work or
anything else creative that they would like to possibly see published.

i know! look what i wrote. dMX, M! X! doesn't stand for anything. =] i
just ate 2 dxm cough drops, although you'd have to eat the whole bag to
get fucked up + they tase too strong to do that. i did dxm 2x, it's fun,
feels kinda like k, you feel all liquidy. FYI of everybody, do the cough
syrup not the pills if you're going to do it, and avoid guiafsen at ALL
COSTS. it will fuck up your stomach bad, you might puke. so read the
ingredients. the kind that is cough suppressant only has no guiafsen. oh
don't drive if you're on it either, that's pretty much common sense
though...

Can't remember which lists are discussing this but thought both lists
might be interested. This is the response my lil brother sent to 20/20
regarding the rave segment. Maybe I missed it but I didn't think my
brother was even a raver yet! :-) Guess we've made a good impression on
him though.

Dear 20/20,

I was very disappointed in your one sided, misleading "report" on RAVES.
It was more propoganda than unbiased reporting.

I am a 31 year old male who is a productive member of society and I have
attended several raves in the last couple of years.  You are totally missing
the point about raves;  they are about the music and the people.  When you
"interviewed" the group of ravers, all you showed them talking about was
drugs.  I am sure they all told you how much they liked the music and how many
truly nice people they had met at these parties but you chose not to show
this.

You also fail to mention that at many raves they do not sell alcohol or allow
it to be brought in, that you are often searched on the way into a rave, that
many raves are held in actual concert venues, that you must be 18 or 21 years
old to attend some raves, or that most promoters hire security guards (some of
who are off duty police officers).  By the way, I have never seen a fight at a
rave.

One of your supposed experts mentions that there is alot of peer pressure to
do drugs at raves.   I have NEVER seen anyone coaxing someone to do drugs at a
rave.  But in my lifetime I have been to many parties, social occasions, and
business functions were people of ALL ages were urging and sometimes hounding
someone to have another beer!

Your story bring up a host of societal problems  and erroneously leads the
viewer to conclude that if raves are eliminated so will the problems.   You
seem proud of the fact that because of your first story they passed laws that
make it harder to have raves in Florida.   THEN IN THE NEXT SENTENCE you admit
it hasn't reduced drug use among young people.   Can't you figure this out...
the raves aren't the problem.  People who want to do drugs will find them and
do them somewhere.  Just look at prohibition.   Raves could even be part of
the solution.  They give people a place to go to listen to music, dance, and
meet other nice people.

Throughout history the previous generations have been horrified by the youth's
music and culture.  Look at Elvis (gyrating, sexual and demonic music), the
Beatles, other music othe the 1960's, Disco (tight clothes, sexual dancing),
an in the 1980's punk rock (dyed hair and pierced ears).  Well now it's the
1990'and music keeps evolving.   If I was a parent and my kids liked Marilyn
Manson or Tu Pac Shakur, I would be worried.   Techno on the other hand is a
positive music with a positive message...PLUR...Peace, Love, Unity, Respect.

PEACE,
Todd R. Urmanic

   CHOCOLATE CITY--In an address before an emergency session of
Parliament Monday, George Clinton said he is prepared to drop Da Bomb on
Iraq if Saddam Hussein does not loosen up and comply with U.N. weapons
inspectors by the Clinton-imposed deadline of March 1. 

   "For Saddam Hussein to refuse to let U.N. officials inspect Iraqi
weapons facilities as per the terms of Iraq's 1991 Gulf War surrender is
decidedly unfunky of him," Clinton said. "While the decision to drop Da
Bomb is never an easy one, unless Saddam gets down with this whole
U.N.-inspection thang and seriously refunkatizes his stance by March 1,
we will have no choice but to tear the roof off Baghdad." 

   Preparations for the military strike, dubbed Operation
Supergroovalisticprosifunkstication Storm, are already underway. The
Mothership is ready and on standby at Starchild Air Force Base in
Detroit, where more than 5,000 bop gunners are making final preparations
for deployment to the Persian Gulf. Clinton has also ordered an
additional 2,500 Aquaboogie Amphibious Assault units to the Gulf,
bringing the total P-Funk Nation military presence in the region to
23,000. 

   According to General William "Bootsy" Collins, the primary goal of
the ground assault is to breach Hussein's presidential palace, capture
the Iraqi leader, and "put some serious funk in his trunk." 

   Collins acknowledged that the mission would not be easy. 

   "Saddam's palace is heavily fortified. In the front, it's protected
by several dozen towers manned with armed guards, and in the back,
there's a 50-foot high hump--so high you can't get over it and so wide
you can't get around it," Collins said. "Having our men attempt to
attack from the front would be suicide: If we are to have any chance of
entering the palace and funkatizing Saddam, we've got to get over the
hump. After all, if you want to capture a boogie, you've got to attack
from the back." 

   Despite the difficulty of the task ahead, troop morale is high. "As a
soldier in the army of Uncle Jam, I have pledged my full groovallegiance
to Commander-In-Chief Clinton," said Lieutenant Bernie Worrell of the
army's elite 72nd Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squadron. "I am
fully prepared to give up my life for the funk. To the rear... march." 

   "Executing political adversaries, shunning foreigners, condemning
America as 'The Great Satan'--that Saddam is one uptight cat,"
Mothership captain Eddie Hazel said.  "For too long, he has ruled Iraq
with neither a glide in his stride nor a dip in his hip. At this point,
our only remaining option is to drop a serious funk bomb on him."

   Clinton's ultimatum before Parliament was met with high praise from
numerous top-ranking Chocolate City officials, including Secretary of
Education Richard Pryor, Secretary of Fine Arts Stevie Wonder and First
Lady Aretha Franklin. 

   "Saddam has two choices," Pryor said. "Get down or step down." 

   While polls indicate that Operation
Supergroovalisticprosifunkstication Storm enjoys strong support among
Chocolate City residents, many residents of the city's less funky
vanilla suburbs question its purpose. 

   "Why are we dropping Da Bomb on Iraq if it's only Saddam we're
after?"  Peter Strosser, 37, said. "If Da Bomb is dropped on Baghdad,
the bootys of countless innocent Iraqi civilians will be tragically
loosened. Is that what we want, to turn millions of decent, reserved
Iraqis into free-spirited, dance-crazed party people? I think not." 

   "The effects of dropping this 50,000-megafunk bomb on a heavily
populated city like Baghdad will be devastating," said Linda Sue
Strelczyk, president of Suburbanites Against Da Bomb. "At ground zero,
the explosion will give off a horrific, blinding flash-light, causing
untold millions who look directly into it to get totally freaky." 

   Responding to the anti-Bomb protests among the unfunky, Clinton made
an impassioned plea for unity. 

   "In times of crisis such as this, we must stand united, not divided,"
Clinton said. "We must join together as one nation under a groove,
getting down just for the funk of it."

yeah he did this trick i had never heard before, possibly cos they had
this phat gemini mixer with lots of neato knobs and other twiddlies ...  
he used it to pull out a real tweaky noise from one of his records for 
a lot of his scratching.  does ne1 know if that was really what he was
doing?

neato.

I was wondering how long it would take before a post about dxm would
appear on this list.  I have done it 3 or 4 times and it is always a blast
(either like being drunk & stoned at the same time or like E but usually
without the beautiful emotional effects).  Never done it at high doses but
I guess it can be pretty intense (a lot of comparisions to K are made).
In any case, before you even think about chugging that bottle of
robotussin check out the following faq:
http://www.frognet.net/dxm/contents.html

The stuff is fun but can be addictive (psychologicly), dangerous and
scary.  Also, be damn careful not getting caught.  All it takes is one
dumbass to get the stuff outlawed.  It is definately the funnest legal
drug even though it is pretty ghetto.
Be safe kids!

i went to a party once in an art gallery on the north side a few years ago
... i remember some mc "atomics wordsmiff" was in one room, the other room
had a big display running right through the middle of it, and it got
busted about ten minutes after i paid the cover.  then some of us moved to
168.  it's not a fond memory.

ok, this is just an innocent question, don't get all bent, i'm not 
getting personal.....

there...that said....

so anyway, i was wondering if anyone sees a difference in attitudes with 
a difference in style of techno....say, the house-heads have a general 
attitude, the junglists have another....something like that. 

now i don't mean like overall, life attitude, but attitude at a party or 
at a club night that's for that specific style.

i dunno.  just wondering.....

k bye =)

  hi, well i have seen a difference in attitudes in people who like
  house & jungle, especially in the chat rooms, jungle kids talk
  bad about the house kids, and have an attitude about their music..
  I like both music and don't have an attitude about it at all, and get
  flack about liking both. I don't get it.
  My friends (outside the chat rooms) dress differently if they like
  jungle (camoflage, cargo pants) and the house kids ( polo, or some
  other fashion type clothes). This seems to change their attitude
  a bit, the jungle kids are tougher (but not mean) and the house
  kids are more plur like. has anyone noticed this???
  thats my personal expierence latley, but i have been raving for
  seven or so  years and in the beginning we all dressed like clowns
  everyone was a candy raver (and proud of it) more huggy and plurry...
  PLUR (focused on the respect),

What does she spin?  Is she any good?

ABSOLUT

PS-She is the shit . . . and somebody should definitely throw a rave and
call it KAY!  It can just be some big ass 3-D letters witha trippy ass
background.  everyone wearing complete spandex outfits would be let in
for half price or soemthing :)

yeah, i saw her for the first time at biz.  i like her "own thing"
mentality, although i've never been inside her mind or even spoken to her --
someone introduce me.  but what i want to know is..why is she called the
TURKEY lady?!  please tell me she didn't make an outfit out of old dried up
turkey bits and gravvy.  another thing..if the event is called KAY, people
who are not familar with KAY may get the wrong idee and believe it to be
some massive k party (which would be extremely exciting).  missing or
ignoring the point of a rave is somewhat unheard of these days (comparable
to the prevalence of smallpox). =/

random:
who would like to see movies flashed/played on a videoscreen instead of
expensive comp graphics?  show some dystopic, scifi films like: logan's run,
thx1138, wargames, the andromeda strain.  movies with ancient computer
themes.  in fact, on a silghtly related note, the soundtrack to logan's run
is the shit..it could be played today, undiscernable from the rest of
current electronic music (i.e., it was ahead of its time).

i'll rip your neck off,
andrew

  flack about liking both. I don't get it.
  My friends (outside the chat rooms) dress differently if they like
  jungle (camoflage, cargo pants) and the house kids ( polo, or some
  other fashion type clothes). This seems to change their attitude
  a bit, the jungle kids are tougher (but not mean) and the house
  kids are more plur like. has anyone noticed this???>>

no shit!...we had a private chat on AOL for da porn cru & amy made the
mistake of inviting dis jungle kid...friggin punted me outta my own room!
...needless to say da rest of the porn cru were quite apalled w/ him 
especially when he started braggin 'bout all the kids he punted & how
everybody should join 'the shady cru'...word got out quick thru the AOL
porn cru community & alotta my hacker buds wanted to term dis kid, so
i had to spend the rest o da night talking 'em down (hackers can get really
mental sometimes & start threatening to break into your bank accounts
& donate all yur funds to charity & such)...it's kids like this that really 
turn me off of the whole jungle scene....

I think she spins trance and happy hardcore and some gabber-sounding
stuff.  Whatever she spins, it's definitely NOT what other djs around
P'town spin!  You just never know what's gonna hit her tables!

Have I mentioned I love Kay?

Yeah, and you'd have to wear weird makeup and/or wigs, and you could only
be happy.  And lots of jewelry!

Hmmm . . . judging by the infoline "those who know the score" are the
same people that almost left two DJs stranded at the airport, and made
one DJ ride to cleveland to get a flight home with three crystal heads.

I wouldn't.  But, the question is have you ever seen expensive comp.
graphics played/flashed at a rave?  If you did then I envy you.  I'd love
to see that shit at a rave.

In general there is kind of a rivarly between people that like house and
people that like jungle, and I think that the main reason is is that in a
one room rave and house is being played, all the people that like jungle
are sitting there thinking, "This is soo repetitive, how about some
breakbeast up in dis piece?"  And if jungle is being played, the
househeads sit there thinking, "Fuck jungle, I want some party atmosphere
house!"

Who's right is another question :)

Actually, a while back, at that Metamasik thing that was above Groovy
Emporium, there were some really neat visual things.  First of all, it was
sort of an art gallery, so you got to look at really keen displays in
really neato lighting.  Orgone Cinema was there, too.  There was a guy
that was doing effects with slides that co-incided with the music.  He was
just using his hands and I guess a switcher thing.  Later, there was a
movie playing on the screen.  It was so wacky!  It was a 70's movie
version of Godspell!!  It was great!  I think movies playing at a party
would be pretty nifty.  Especially if they were really wacky fun fun
silly willy movies!

yeah - but its just a bus trip, you know? i think it would probably be
more fun if it was with a whole bunch of cracked-out k headz. im
probably just saying that cause i dont personally know any of them,
and i find them a source of great amusement, but i think that a bus
trip with all of the o kids would be fun as hell...

>> who would like to see movies flashed/played on a videoscreen   >> 
instead of ... comp graphics?

     I would!  
     There's this guy around Kent who plays ambient-ish electronic    
music.  He and a friend call themselves "The New Severe Theatre".     
Anyway, I saw him play at the reception for a gallery show put on by a 
student arts organization.  He had a video that he had made playing on 
two tvs.  It was awesome!  What he did was take this scene from Blade 
Runner in which this girl in a clear plastic raincoat just keeps 
stumbling around crashing through store fronts and breaking the glass. 
He kept repeating the scene in slow motion on the tape for like two 
hours. But he progressively decayed the image so that every time the 
scene started over it would be a bit more blurred.  Eventually, it was 
so blurred, all you could make out were blotches of color.  Then, it 
became lucid again and started the same decay process over.  It was 
awesome!

I think the two have strikingly different attitudes.  Back in seattle we
don't really have a jungle community, most everyone is into house or
trance.  I'm still trying to get used to the whole pittsburgh jungle
scene.  From my observations jungle kids are a bit tougher and have a bit
more attitude.  That is not too say that they are not beautiful kids and
they have no PLUR spirit, it is just that it is often under a hard
exterior.  House kids just seem to eminate PLUR towards everyone within a
2 mile radius (must be all that E).  I think a lot of it has to do with
the messages in the music (house=dancing, love, peace; jungle=gangstas,
"busta cap in yo ass", etc).  I'm not dissing on jungle kids at all and
I'm not one myself so my opinion is definately biased ("house-nation,
under a groove...").  Anyone who goes to raves is cool in my book.

pEace to both camps,
jP <- total househead for life

Logans Run is a good movie...especially since its one of them fox 53 sat
afternoon movies that i relied on as a kid who didn't have cable, a vcr or
a good antenna.  I think adding more visual elements to any rave is
awesome...Home videos would be interesting...anything with a bizarre
or futuristic element of course.  How about 'Transformers the Movie'? ;)
When T1000 played at 168 he had Starwars playing in reverse, projected
onto the wall behind him...tres cool. :)

do you think there is a connection between people who watched "fraggle rock"
as a child and people who prefer house?


in other words..

--->who liked "fraggle rock" as a child and enjoys house music [the most,
not just tolerate] these days?  if you worshipped the show and you fancy
hardhouse, even better.

I hear ya...I guess everybody thinks that fancy computer graphics are so
commonplace - on tv and everywhere - that they aren't impressive anymore.
I guess its a little bit true, but If someone came up with a really nice
artistic comp animation video using 98' technology, that would be wicked.

Even Tron-Level stuff still looks cool to me if projected on a big screen.

Hell, I'd watch atari games if the projected em'.

remembering the fox 53 saturday afternoon movie music...

that is what i am saying, man.

logan's run would make an excellent movie-able-to-be-enjoyed-by-most-ravers
or "raverfilm".  all of the elements are there:  computers, robots, the
whole set is surreal as hell, they are on a quest to find sanctuary, they
are basically as radical as ravers -- they want to boot the system.  i own a
copy of the movie if anyone wants to follow through.

better yet, have people play atari games (but dont make them pay) and have
their games projected on the screen.  we can even coordinate some games to
climax (no, not like that) with the dj's "set".  i say, the simpler the comp
graphics the better (atari, tron, anything circa 1980-1985).  i think it is
difficult to get into the more complex (silicon graphics^tm) type effects --
simplicity prevails (always/sometimes/never __?).

why was she called the TURKEY lady?

Interesting theory.  I never had cable, so i never even had a chance to
watch this show.  I'd say I wouldn't prefer house, although it really
depends on my mood.

I'd say there are alot of factors to why i like what i like, but one
childhood influence is the "Sugar Beets" song from Sesame Street.  I used
to walk around singing that to myself over and over again "beets beets
sugar beets, beets sugar beets..." x 3 million.  Then when I heard
oldschool hardcore stuff, that's what it sounded like to me.

Shut up tom, or I'll "bust a cap in ya"!  Junglists are the ruffest.  We
are the weeble-people of the rave scene that can't be pushed over.  
House-lovers are just them stinky playskool people who don't even have any
arms, and can be easily knocked over.

"reading rainbow" music is ambient.  "the great space coaster" was kinda
early eighties disco.  hmmm, i think i got into techno because i got a

OH MY GOSH!  I LOVE THAT SKIT!!!!  IT WAS ALL ABOUT SUGAR!!!!!!!!!!!

Do you remember the one about crayons?  That one has really stuck with me.
It was all about how crayola crayons are made and at the very end there
were gyrating crayons in a bin!!  I just wanted to play with the shiny
wax!

Mookie!!!  I remember the fraggle with the pompom pigtails, I don't
remember and I remember her saying Mookie a lot.  I remember the human and
the dog and the giants next door.  I wanted to go swimming with the
fraggles but I was afraid to be that small.

Anyone remember the Wuzzles or the Gummybears or Foofur?  Dontcha think it
would be nifty to get your paws on some gummyberry juice.  Bouncy bouncy
bouncy bouncy...hey wait, I'm a candy raver!!!! ;)

Jenifer Foulmood,

little so she can 
watch cartoons and
not go to preschool.

I loved Fraggle Rock and I'm true to Jungle (having respects for all forms of

I KNEW there was a party on the 28th.  Everyone called me crazy, but I
knew it!  Okay, but I was also a dummyhead.  I accidently erased the post.
So if anyone hasn't erased it, could they please send me the original
post?  Pretty please with sugar on top?

Thank you

I watched Fraggle Rock as a kid and I like both jungle and house.  But I 
must say I tend to lean more towards the jungle side.  Go figure.

Heh, with today's desktops being so much more powerfull then yesterday's
mainframes its almost impossible to NOT generate cool graphics. :)
Though I do wish to ask what you mean by fancy computer graphics? Its
been a long time since I have seen any really fancy ones at any local
raves.  Seems they only comeout at the really big parties on 'theme'
days like newyears even and such.  Personally I still go for the fancy
computer graphics only because to me they are gorgeos when done right
and just plain funny when they are done wrong.  

Actually, im curios, how many people out there still trip at raves
versus E and K and the other moody drugs. Private email response is
fine. Is the acid content of raves dwindling? Or is this just in
pittsburgh? Or what?

The reason I ask is this may play a little bit in the relationship of
insane comp graphics vs's movies. I havnt done anything else except acid
(and dont plan on it) but from what I hear from other people comp
graphics just arent as beautiful on other stuff versus a heavy hit of
pseudo-LSD.  

Personally I miss the large projected mandelbrot sets or even a
screensaver of plasma. Heh, doesnt take much to get me off visually.

Though I would still think more graphics even movies would better the
party atmosphere.  Anygood party, imho, benifits from a good amount of
nonwhite indirect lighting, especially volitile lighting.  There just
aint nothin cooler in my book as a fractal being projected on to a crowd
thats moving and shaking.

Me!  Oooh !  Me!!  I loved that show and I know all the songs! And I love
house!  I prefer house more now than I used to...it seems to get stronger
and stronger through the years....

Hey!  Your making fun of me aren't you?!  :) I guess my post was a bit
silly.  I think alot of what I think is a jungle attitude is probably just
a east coast attitude.  People do seem more laid back out west (and less
humorous as well).  I admit it, I am the king of generalizations. 

pEace,

Lets not forget thingings made from spare parts.  The best way to make
friends with Kay is to clean out your miscellaneous parts bin.

Ever see that bolt from a bridge she has?  Frightening.

No shit, whatever happend to this?  Now everything is so based on 
style and this and that...bleh..The other thing I miss is that raves 
didn't used to be attended just by 'ravers', it was all kinds of 
people from all kinds of 'subcultures'..cyber geeks, punks, wierdos, 
fetish ppl, and even lots of 'normal' people...and everybody was 
there not only for great music, but because anybody could be 
themselves, or whoever else they may have wanted to be, and nobody 
would give 'em shit for it...now you gotta wear this or that, or fit 
into some group of some sort...i think the spirit is being lost...

Logan's Run would be pretty cool.  So would _Fantastic Voyage_ or
_Innerspace_.  Just wish I knew which styles they would complement well.
_The Lawnmower Man_ would be pretty neat if certain parts were looped
well.

Let's step it up a bit:  Commodore or Amiga games.  Anyone else remember
'Little Computer People' or 'Neuromancer'?  How about some Xwindows games
played from laptops and projected (DAMN, I love xbill and xninja).  And
descent runs pretty well on a 486.

Wow, I was just flipping channels on the boob tube, and I actually 
came across Bad Boy Bill spinning a set on Much Music..And you know 
what?  It was a sweet set..It seemed that when he spun at Gspot he 
just took all the songs off his Cd's and changed the order..But this 
set he was spinning, on CABLE TV, was totaly awesome! and then they 
broke to a commercial and cut out all but like the first 10 minutes 
of it...ohwell  :)

Yeah because the west coast is a bunch of candy raver herbs.And anyways I
credit the west coast with gangsterizing (ruining) Jungle.Why does the west

Could somebody post lineup & info for detonation if you have it?  I 
don't have a flyer and didn't see it on the ROM..Also anything else 
going on this weekend?  Thanx, I'd appreciate it alot alot!!!!! :)  

Chris

ps - I duno if it's cuz nobody sends him stuff, or cuz he's lazy (I'm 
opting for the first..) but there never seems to be much on the ROM, 
and I know theres stuff goin on around here somewhere....we should 
all make an effort to send info for any party we hear of to him so we 
can get a nice fat ROM that would actually be of some use!

I thought that the rave scene was one of nonbias.  There is no sexism,
racism.  When you make an innuendo such as the above ("are you female"),
well, in case you can't figure it out, there are certain connotations.
It doesn't matter if it's a joke.  It's in poor taste.  Considering the
intelligence of this list, I expect more.  

I can't think.  I've been up for over 24 hours.  I'm cranky and all I know
is that the remark was highly offensive and if you can't figure out why,
then you're a crackhead.

Smoke up baby,
Jenifer Foulmood

I don't know but I've definitely noticed this.  IT sooo hard to find 'cid
at raves and so easy to find E and shit.

Hell yeah . . . what about aicwarp that's the shit.  If you like that you
should DEFINITELY check out the newest version of Elements.  Definitely
way up there on teh trippy-meter.

PS-I don't know if you people are serious or not, but I don't think there
is any correlation between tv shows and playfigures you played with when
a kid and the style of techno you like.

I can't believe somebody didn't say, instead of showing movies, show some
anime.  I think that would be cool.

I have a hypothetical question considering people's thought of the
underground vs. mainstream.  What if one day, all the cool music we listen
to became mainstream, heard on the radio 3 times a day, and alternative all
of a sudden became the underground.  Never to be heard on the radio again,
would any of you stay with the music you've loved for so long, or would you
listen to the 'new' underground alternative music?  Just want to know your
thoughts..

Matt

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:
trout@hyperreal.org
please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.

Excerpts from graffiti.raves: 26-Feb-98 {pb-cle} Hypothetical question
by "Matthew J. Meyer"@uakro 
> would any of you stay with the music you've loved for so long, or would you
> listen to the 'new' underground alternative music?  Just want to know your
> thoughts..

Music ive loved for so long. No contest. I have a mix tape of purely
mainstreamish techno/electronica/whatever that i listen to while im in
transit. Personally I like likeing stuff that is mainstream because I
can get to know it and learn the beats and samples. For me hearing
something that I already know is prefered to constantly changing new
stuff. Not to say that I dont like variety, but I *LOVED* it at the last
pgh rave when someone spun the track that starts out with all the high
pitched sounds. (It was played recently at a different pgh rave).  Since
my tripdancing is based on the beats and sounds the more i hear a song
the better i dance to it.

As for mainstream stuff, im sorry but there is nothing more happy in my
opinion then MMBOP and Barbie Girl. :) Go ahead and shoot mebut I love
those two songs.

most interesting thing....went to hypersonics at club chameleon last 
night on a fluke....
turns out that Product 19 and the Instigator were spinning and another 
dj who spun a good jungle set (anyone know who it was?)....and the funny 
thing was ---

NO ONE WAS THERE.

there were a dozen people there at the most.  

so, um, just trying to get the word out that there is an alternative to 
Metropol (*cringe*) on a thursday :)



k bye =)

Hmm..  what would 'MacGyver,' 'Probe,' 'Quantum Leap,' and 'He-Man' say,
then?

Honest question:  How many people might show up if there was a screen

I don't know about you and Marilyn Hanson ;), but Barbie Girl is great and
I'll tell you why I think that.  Have you ever really listened to the
words?  They're clearly making fun of all the plastic people that are
listening to this song and loving it.  You know the kind, those blonde
haired, blue eyed sorority chicks (frat girls) that take it oh so
seriously.  It cracks me up with irony!

Are you crazy?!  I would be there if they were only showing Sailor Moon,
no rave, just Sailor Moon.  It used to be on every day at 4:00, then they
took it off and put on Sweet Valley Twits.  So much for international
programming!

Before I was raver chick, I was alterna-girl.  I listened to alternative
stuff back when it was cool cause it was alternative, and I still do even
though most of it is mainstreamed, because I LIKE it.  

I don't understand people who can only like one form of music.  I mean
people that are only into house, or only into jungle, or techno, or hard
rock, or classic rock, or alternative rock, or ska, or punk, or rap, or
pop, or jazz, or classical, or baroque, or early music, or contemporary.
You get the idea, I hope.  There is beauty in each form, otherwise so many
people wouldn't like so many forms.  Even if you can't see the value for
yourself, you can appreciate that someone put their effort into producing
a sound for your unworthy ears to listen to.   I'm not huge fan of early
music (think "Chant"), but I tell ya what, it is fucking hard and that
alone earns my respect.  

Sorry to rant off the subject.  I know a certain live PA guy that's
studying composition that says he hates Bach and Mozart and that disturbs
me greatly.  

Like whatever you want, it doesn't matter if it's "cool".

Actually, I heard that Kay is such the hardcore Diva that she just walked
up to a bridge and ripped the thing out with her teeth.  She's got
"much-much mana". ;)  I like her 'bird sorceress' outfit personally.

I swear that I'm dressin' up for the next party here, i swear it.

about thursdays in pittsburgh ...

i *heard* that the music at metropol is phat.  they started a new party
since roman's inferno crew left, but it's still on the hard house tip.
but i haven't gone and i probably won't go cos i believe that no matter
how u look at it, the crowd is still metoropol.  (fat, hairy, greaseballs
who drink bud lite and wear steelers sweaters.)

also i am not surprised to hear that chameleon was empty on thursday ...
it's a clean joint, perfect for weekly parties ... but nobody goes.  it's
on penn ave in the strip of pittsburgh, @26th st.

even tho i'm not getting paid for this, i have to give props to chameleon
- the spot is really phat, they book decent local djs like vic money, lil
rick, instigator, product 19, lil rick, farmer tea ... without attitude u
get at most clubs.  but bring id especially if you hear the owner is gona
be at the door, he's pretty ruff about having kids there.

Yeah I went thursday and the music was pretty damn good for a while... I
dunno who was spinning but there was a good bit of speed garage mixed in
with a little jungle and more of the regular metropol version of techno.

I dont think the crowd was anything like the typical metropol crowd tho.
Thursday is "Alternative Lifestyles" night again there, and I'd say that's
what the crowd was like. They have this thingy where you get like 50$ in
sexy money at the door and yer supposed to give it to people who look sexy.
they in turn can redeem it for drinks/ doorprizes etc.. So like I'm dancing
to some kickass speed garage and this chick all decked out in a leather
dominatrix suit comes up to me and gives me $70 sexy bucks.. at first I was
like cool.. but then I figured she picked me out of the crowd as the dweeb
most likely to lick her boots, then I started feeling little down bout
myself hehe :) Then later I was taking a rest on the stairs and some black
dude came up and gave me $10 sexy bux... herm. I"m strait so I didnt know
what to say so I said thanks and got up and started dancing on the other
side of the room so he'd like get the picture on my sexual prefs...

I went the weekend before last, but for some reason I dont feel comfortable
dancing in there. specially 21+ only nights cause its so bare... I'll be
there more when they go back to all-ages.

                                            ^^^^^^^ nice to finally see in
writing. still don't understand why it's 18+, but at least they're not
advertising all ages when, as some of us have been rudely made aware of,
it's 18 and over.

   peace,

Farmer Tea?  Did he already play there, or is it coming up in the future?
I'v had so much homework lately that I haven't had a chance to check out
hypersonics, but I'll be there this week.  Anyone know the lineup?
