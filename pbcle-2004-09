Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--

would it make you feel better if they called it 'broken breaks' ?  ;p

there's a fine fine funk breaks label that popped up last year.  i've been
emailing these guys back and forth and it turns out they used to come up
for pittsburgh parties a few years ago.  i love this label.

funk breaks, tom..i know that always kind of confused you.  and no..not icey.

i'm going to bring these boys up to play sometime:

i just cant help it, as soon as things start sounding too much 
like fast hiphop they sound corny. if theyre mashed up and edited 
like 2-step, broken beat, or old jungle, they sound good. 
everything else really does just sound like one really long dj 
icey record to me.

i can't even make fun of all icey records.  many a dj has learned to
beatmatch blindfolded via icey records.  and i still get all emotional
when i hear anything from the warehouse ep.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: MoveOn

>From MoveOn.org:

To voice your opposition:

http://www.moveon.org/roadless/

The Bush administration has announced plans to open 60 million acres
of America's last pristine wild forests to logging, drilling, and
mining. It's the biggest single giveaway to the timber industry in the
history of our national forests.

The Forest Service has proposed a repeal of the Roadless Area
Conservation Rule, one of the most popular Federal regulations in
history.

Why would the Bush administration want to build roads on untouched
wilderness? Since the year 2000, the timber industry has given $25
million in political donations to President Bush and his allies in
Congress.

Our national forests belong to all of us, and should be managed accordingly.

http://www.moveon.org/roadless/

Folks, give two minutes out of your day
to voice opposition if ya could, I don't
normally post this kinda stuff unless I
thought it was necessary.

On that same note, other fun stuff is shifting around at WRUW.
The new program guide should be on the web in the next few days or so.

My show, "The Raver's Edge" picked up another half hour or airtime, so
we'll be hitting the airwaves with a whopping 3 hours of electronic on
Saturdays from 5-8pm.

Oh yeah, and if any folks out there are interested in mixing a live set
sometime on The Raver's Edge, feel free to let me know. Either at this
address or to bookings@raversedge.net

Take it easy folks.

I didn't realize that moveon.org had shady funding, but I guess most large scale political group do.   However this issue is very serious.  Another fuckhead move by Bush.
Old growth forests don't just "grow back".   The ecosystem damage will be severe.  The last protected forests in the US are worth a phone message or email to your local representative and/or senator.
I'll take the "hippie" flame in stride.

it doesnt. i was making a sarcastic reference to speaker of the 
house dennis hastert's recent sladerous comments about the sources 
of mr soros's money simply because mr soros has given money to 
marijuana legalization groups in arizona and california. 
newspapers are your friends.

Midnight Mixer Friday September 10th

Full details, mp3s, and a picture scrapbook can be found at 
http://www.midnightmixer.com

The lineup was assembled to allow for as many new performers as possible...

:: Thursday Club improvises noise :: Epilacs conducts a cpu :: Reese spins 
house :: Jamie Tyler tweaks techno :: Digital Cowgirl screens original 
video :: JDAT mixes video feedback :: Cloud Ten controls the lights :: 
Sophate amps the room :: The Social Security Crew makes the night run 
smooth :: YOU create the vibe ::

The theme is "everafter" and will be our first event in the Parrish Hall.

We are asking you to bring a picture of peoples' faces to create a collage 
that reminds us there are billions of other lives turning our world.

Bring a picture for the artpiece and admission is $5 otherwise $7. As 
usual, bring a recording of music you produced and get in FREE. (All but 
one of the performers brought music to previous events - please do not pass 
off other people's music as your own - if you don't want to pay be more 
creative than that)

The location is Orthodox Cleveland - 6205 Detroit Ave - Cleveland's near 
west-side.

Doors open at 11:00pm.

Ramzi

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} record stores in ohio

I tend to browse online and then give Doug @ poo-bas a list of hard 
crap to find that eats his time up from doing regular things. I'm not 
really into crate browsing (can we say ADHD anyone?), but if I have to 
do that, I'd much rather do it at Poo-bas than the Crayon (mostly for 
organizational purposes), even tho I'm really kinda into stuff that no 
one really carries.

ACB is hard to find. Find out where they've moved to, and yes, they 
have a fabulous dnb collection. They're above some other store now, I'm 
sure Steph can tell us all exactly where, she told me before.

I have to give big props to all record store owners tho. With the 
exception of one online store, most of the ones I've dealt with can 
never ship me what i put in my shopping cart. And that one that is the 
exception will not special order anything, give me bulk discounts 
(always buy in bulk!), or give me recommendations. I've gotten some 
wicked recommendations at the crayon that I wouldn't have ever found 
otherwise. Poo-bas folks have gone way out of their way to find me 
things. Doug cares about his store and customers (look at those phat 
bags & seal/sticker), and the same goes for everyone else I've dealt 
with in an Ohio record store. I've never dealt with Kelly's store, as 
they're kinda far from me, but i get the same vibe from them.

Ok, forgive me for rambling, I just wanted to give some props to 
something rare, people who actually care about the businesses they run. 
Something I find rare in any business these days. These are all very 
dedicated folks, and deserve our support.

- Mike

ps. Had a molar and the impacting wisdom tooth pressing against it 
removed a few hours ago. Painkillers = Rambling.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sun Sep 05                        SLAM BUSH                      Pittsburgh

Slam Bush is looking for a national champion; someone whose voice could 
represent Hip Hop in a face-to-face debate against the President, either 
in the streets or behind the podium.

Hip Hop can help send George Bush back to Texas where he belongs.

Starting in August, local Slam Bush battles will be held around the 
country. At these events, ground breaking slam poets and battle MCs will 
bang on Bush for local championships and cash prizes.

Winners from across the country will be selected to attend the National 
Slam Bush Championship in late September to perform in front of some of 
Hip Hop's most respected names. The Slam Bush Champ will be awarded a 
Grand Prize of $5000.

To enter the contest, locate a Slam Bush event in your area now.

If you're not a slam poet or MC, we still need help organizing slams and 
promoting the contest. Get involved!

Complete contest rules available here.

The idea for Slam Bush grew out of an essay by Davey D in the new book 
How to Get Stupid White Men Out of Office where he proposed hip-hop 
battles against Bush in major swing state cities.
 
The book is a project of The League of Pissed Off Voters, a national 
organization that teaches the Hip Hop generation how to flip government 
and take back our communities.
 
We have local Leagues forming in more than 50 cities. Each one is 
mobilizing their people, working a 90 Day Plan, and forming voter blocs 
and to swing elections and Smackdown the bad guys from your local school 
board to the President.

URSULA RUCKER

Without question, Ursula Rucker is one of today's foremost poets.  
Having collaborated with some of music's most sophisticated innovators 
such as King Britt,  The Roots,  4 Hero,   Jazzanova,  Masters at Work,  
Rob Yancey,  and The Society,  Ursula Rucker has honed her seductive 
spoken wordplay inside Philly Soul, Hip-Hop, and Nu Jazz-Broken Beat. 
She combines social awareness with womanhood, black culture, and love 
for something musically alluring. A journalism graduate from Temple 
University, Rucker made her poetic debut in 1994 at Philly's celebrated 
Zanzibar Blue.  As word-of-mouth spread through the Philly scene, Rucker 
caught the attention of local globetrotting DJ-producer King Britt who 
brought her into the studio to record the international dance floor 
classic "Supernatural".  But it was after her jaw-dropping track "The 
Unlocking", a disturbing account of sexual exploitation, on The Roots' 
second album "Do You Want More?!" that the poet and songstress was 
brought to the attention of an international audience.  Her subsequent 
follow ups on The Roots "Illadelph Halflife" and "Things Fall Apart" and 
a string of singles with reknowned producers 4hero and Jazzanova led 
Rucker to record her own debut solo "Supa Sista" in 2001 and her current 
release "Silver or Lead", both receiving international acclaim receiving 
props from critics in URB, VIBE, XXL, Panache, Blues & Soul  and 
Straight No Chaser magazines. To date, Ursula has performed her work at 
an array of venues, universities and festivals including the Montreax 
Jazz Festival and the 1999 Winter Music Conference.  Drawing on

9/26 - RJD2 / Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  - 09/26 - RJD2 
/ Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  Contrary to popular belief, 
heroes sometimes lurk behind the curtains, actively choosing to elude 
visibility. Make no mistake, though-if the mystery man behind the boards 
is the man behind a classic beat, you'll soon know his name. In the late 
90's, producers crept from the shadows to seize the spotlight of 
mainstream hip-hop, as well as the pop charts. In the last few years, 
one man shows such as Moby, DJ Shadow and Timbaland have proved what 
underground hip-hop fans have known since Marley Marl's heyday-a 
talented producer can shine solo. Enter RJD2. From 1998 to 1999, he saw 
success blossom as DJ/producer for the Columbus-based group the 
Megahertz, with two twelve-inch singles on Bobbito Garcia's legendary NY 
label, Fondle 'em records. This explosive entrance to the underground 
hip-hop scene gave way to shows from Europe to Japan, not to mention 
garnering mention in Vibe magazine's "History of Hip-Hop" historical 
volume. Opening doors outside of the east coast, the MHz went on to 
appear on the Bay Area's ABB records compilation, Always Bigger and 
Better, Volume 1. Their contribution (entitled "This Year") was voted 
best track on the ABB website, while competing against major label 
heavyweights such as Dilated Peoples and Defari.

speed garage? wild. i still find it fascinating that people still 
play this. new speed garage records havent been made in so long. i 
actually just make a classic 2-step mix tape for my car yesterday, 
it made me sad thinking about how UK garage went downhill. there 
are definitely still a couple people around plaing the old 2-step 
sounds, but i listened online to mj cole's label Prolific's new 
stuff (i have the very first one from 98, one of my favorite 
garage records) and i wasnt too into it. it sucks that garage died 
in almost the exact same way that jungle did. 

i might come out tonight for a bit to see whats up with some speed 
garage.

http://salon.com/news/feature/2004/09/02/allison/index.html

Sept. 2, 2004  |  NEW YORK -- Before there was Karl Rove, Lee Atwater or ev=
en James Baker, the Bush family's political guru was a gregarious newspaper=
 owner and campaign consultant from Midland, Texas, named Jimmy Allison. In=
 the spring of 1972, George H.W. Bush phoned his friend and asked a favor: =
Could Allison find a place on the Senate campaign he was managing in Alabam=
a for his troublesome eldest son, the 25-year-old George W. Bush?

"The impression I had was that Georgie was raising a lot of hell in Houston=
, getting in trouble and embarrassing the family, and they just really want=
ed to get him out of Houston and under Jimmy's wing," Allison's widow, Lind=
a, told me. "And Jimmy said, 'Sure.' He was so loyal."

Linda Allison's story, never before published, contradicts the Bush campaig=
n's assertion that George W. Bush transferred from the Texas Air National G=
uard to the Alabama National Guard in 1972 because he received an irresisti=
ble offer to gain high-level experience on the campaign of Bush family frie=
nd Winton "Red" Blount. In fact, according to what Allison says her late hu=
sband told her, the younger Bush had become a political liability for his f=
ather, who was then the United States ambassador to the United Nations, and=
 the family wanted him out of Texas. "I think they wanted someone they trus=
ted to keep an eye on him," Linda Allison said.

After more than three decades of silence, Allison spoke with Salon over sev=
eral days before and during the Republican National Convention this week --=
 motivated, as she acknowledged, by a complex mixture of emotions. They inc=
lude pride in her late husband's accomplishments, a desire to see him remem=
bered, and concern about the apparent double standard in Bush surrogates at=
tacking John Kerry's Vietnam War record while ignoring the president's irre=
sponsible conduct during the war. She also admits to bewilderment and hurt =
over the rupture her husband experienced in his friendship with George and =
Barbara Bush. To this day, Allison is unsure what caused the break, though =
she suspects it had something to do with her husband's opposition to the el=
der Bush becoming chairman of the Republican National Committee under Presi=
dent Nixon.

"Something happened that I don't know about. But I do know that Jimmy didn'=
t expect it, and it broke his heart," she said, describing a ruthless side =
to the genial Bush clan of which few outsiders are aware.

Personal history aside, Allison's recollections of the young George Bush in=
 Alabama in 1972 are relevant as a contrast to the medals for valor and bra=
very that Kerry won in Vietnam in the same era. An apparent front group for=
 the Bush campaign, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, has attacked Kerry in te=
levision ads as a liar and traitor to veterans for later opposing a war tha=
t cost 58,000 American lives. Bush, who has resisted calls from former Viet=
nam War POW John McCain, R-Ariz., to repudiate the Swift Boat ads, has said=
 he served honorably in the National Guard.

Allison's account corroborates a Washington Post investigation in February =
that found no credible witnesses to the service in the Alabama National Gua=
rd that Bush maintains he performed, despite a lack of documentary evidence=
. Asked if she'd ever seen Bush in a uniform, Allison said: "Good lord, no.=
 I had no idea that the National Guard was involved in his life in any way.=
" Allison also confirmed previously published accounts that Bush often show=
ed up in the Blount campaign offices around noon, boasting about how much a=
lcohol he had consumed the night before. (Bush has admitted that he was a h=
eavy drinker in those years, but he has refused to say whether he also used=
 drugs).

"After about a month I asked Jimmy what was Georgie's job, because I couldn=
't figure it out. I never saw him do anything. He told me it basically cons=
isted of him contacting people who were impressed by his name and asking fo=
r contributions and support," Allison said.

C. Murphy Archibald, a nephew of Red Blount by marriage and a Vietnam veter=
an who volunteered on the campaign from September 1972 until election night=
, corroborated Allison's recollections, though he doesn't recall that the B=
ush name carried much cachet in Alabama at the time. "I say that because th=
e scuttlebutt on the campaign was that Allison was very sharp and might act=
ually be able to pull off this difficult race" against the incumbent Democr=
at, Sen. John Sparkman, Archibald said. "But then no one understood why he =
brought this young guy from Texas along. It was like, 'Who was this guy who=
 comes in late and leaves early? And why would Jimmy Allison, who was so im=
pressive, bring him on?'"

Bush, who had a paid slot as Allison's deputy in a campaign staffed largely=
 by volunteers, sat in a little office next to Allison's, said Archibald, a=
 workers compensation lawyer in Charlotte, N.C. Indeed, when Bush was actua=
lly there, he did make phone calls to county chairmen. But he neglected his=
 other duty: the mundane but important task of mailing out campaign materia=
ls to the county campaign chairs. Archibald took up the slack, at Allison's=
 request. "Jimmy didn't say anything about George. He just said, 'These mat=
erials are not getting out. It's causing the candidate problems. Will you t=
ake it over?'"

While Kerry earned a Silver Star and a Bronze Star after saving a crewmate'=
s life under fire on the Mekong River in Vietnam, by contrast, the Georgie =
that Allison knew was a young man whose parents did not allow him to live w=
ith the consequences of his own mistakes. His powerful father -- whom the s=
on seemed to both idolize and resent -- was a lifeline for Bush out of pred=
icaments. After Bush graduated from Yale in 1968, his slot in the Texas Air=
 National Guard allowed him to avoid active duty service in Vietnam. The fo=
rmer speaker of the Texas state House, Democrat Ben Barnes, now admits he p=
ulled strings to get Bush his coveted guard slot, and says he's "ashamed" o=
f the deed. "60 Minutes" will air an interview with Barnes next Wednesday, =
but George H.W. Bush denounced Barnes' claims in an interview aired on CBS.=
 "They keep saying that and it's a lie, a total lie. Nobody's come up with =
any evidence, and yet it's repeated all the time," the former president sai=
d, in what could just as well describe the playbook for the Swift Boat Vete=
rans ads.=20

Oh, now THERE'S a real reliable source of information...er, I mean info-tainment. Whole lot of
fact-checking going on there, I'm sure.

And when I send you to some no-name-schlub's left-leaning personal website to prove one of my
points, I better not hear word-one come out of that ridiculous pie-hole of yours.

That's like treating the idiots on Rotten Tomatoes as genuine film critics.

Seriously, you'd have scored more thought-points had you sent me to something like Faux News or
Swift Boat Captains for Unabashed Falsehoods' websites....y'know...something that someone is paying
attention to?

How about when I make an argument, I direct you to www.hypnotyza.com as an authoritarian source of
information?

It's a site to highlight the liberal bias in the media, nothing more.

Anyone who denies the liberal bias in the mainstream media is living under  
a rock.

Anyone who denies the liberal bias in the mainstream media is living 
under 
a rock.

 

The media values money more than right/left agendas.  They spit what 
sells, and they spin for whoever gives the most $$$.  They're more 
capitalist than liberal.  

The Wall Street Journal is a very good source for global political and 
economic news if you're interested in stripping out the politcal spin 
and hype.

son, im not sure what youve been smoking, but youve got to give it 
up. WSJ is as conservative as it comes. read their editorials if 
you dont believe me. as a matter of fact, most economics related 
rags are conservative, if only because its to their interest to 
lessen restrictions on business which is definitely a hard right 
issue. paul krugman is the leading lefty economist, and one of my 
heroes. he shoots holes in all the "educated" nonsense that comes 
out of conservative economic corners.

it really is a different sound and feeling. grime/sublow/8 bar or 
whatever theyre calling it is just really minimal gritty nasty 
shit made for emceeing over. this is where dizzee rascal came 
from. this shit got big in early 02, which is when i stopped 
buying records because they were getting into some nonsense. i got 
the first really huge 8 bar cut "a pulse x" by musical mob, which 
sounded a bit like techno/electro to me, just not as good. after 
that it really went downhill. at this point its like dancehall 
where a certain track will get released 10 times with all 
different vocalists on it. and by vocalists i mean wack uk rappers 
who arent good enough to rap over hiphop beats. its now a very 
underground no dancing no women kind of thing. sound like drum and 
bass at all? the grime comp on rephlex isnt going to help that 
image either, im sure. 

http://www.hyperdub.com/

read the interviews with Plasticman, Wiley, etc. thatll give you 
an idea of what happened to garage. 

and anyway, if garage was built by hype and trendiness, so was 
drum and bass. dont think that shit wasnt guilty as well.

im sorry, you must have confused me with someone who doesnt know 
what hes talking about. any revival is meaningless to me the same 
way the ragga jungle revival is meaningless. ragga is dead, as is 
speed garage and 2-step. 

i have plenty of 4 on the floor uk garage from 98-02 by people 
like qualifide, dj narrows, dj faz, and so many more i cant even 
think of them all. still doesnt make speed garage any more alive. 

300 records in 4 years is about 2 records a week average. thats 
nothing. honestly, even really obscure genres of music come out 
with that much per week. 

havent decided yet if im going to come out or not.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Tonight@Havana - SCOT E

original skool drum and bass was pure...it was just the next step from
acid/rave/hardcore....garage to me...and this is only my opinion....garage
was designed just to draw in ppl that were getting tired of the london boys
club in dnb...so they slowed down the tempos, put the big kick in, and stole
every drum and bass bassline they could get there paws on...then they went
to every dance mag that would listen and build up a ton of hype...which
brought in the trendy's...which made it into a fashion scene more than a
music scene...these are just my opinons mind you....i think the downfall of
garage was the new wave of roller drum and bass that has the more mellowed
out vibe....which is what the ppl that originally got disilliusioned with
drum n bass were looking for...when ppl like calibre, klute, MIST, high
contrast started getting big, garage started dying out...and now drum and
bass is as strong as ever cuz there are so many ppl making so many
styles...hell at most nights in london now they have 2 rooms....the heavy
room and a more chilled room..otherwise known as the childrens room and the
adults room :)

in the end its just frequencies orginized in a musically pleasing way...but
drum and bass has been going strong for what? 15 years? garage is already
dying after 5-8?  just those numbers alone should tell you that the music
was secondary to everything else in that scene.

these are just my opinions....if you like garage and you were drawn in by
the music thats cool...thats definately the way is with the djs and i
respect that...but i think musically it isnt all that.

that was part of it, but so was the darkening of garage and the 
transition to grime, as well as the blowing up of dancehall and 
banghra. uk urban music cant get too far up its own ass on some 
dark tip anymore or people will leave it for something that is 
more interesting. 

>and now drum and

you know thats not true. but were not gonna have that argument 
again ; P 

>in the end its just frequencies orginized in a musically pleasing 
way...but
>drum and bass has been going strong for what? 15 years? garage is 
already
>dying after 5-8?  

well it all depends on what you mean. if by drum and bass has been 
around since old school hardcore and all of that counts, then 
garage has been around even longer. the uk garage scene (and by 
that i mean the scene based around house and garage music in the 
uk) has been around since the late 80s, and has had it 
disctinctive moments just like dnb. grime is the equivalent of 
techstep, 2-step was the equivalent of mashed up breaks, speed 
garage was the equivalent of early jungle. but theyre both dead 
IMO, theyve stagnated for too long in weak waters. there might be 
records coming out, but 99.999999999999999999999999% arent even 
worth thinking about much less listening to.

i think drum and bass is diverse as hell and definately not dead in the
water once you get passed all the pilled up ravers in england that are
dictating where top 40 dnb goes.

as much as i love the harder dnb...good hard dnb is getting hard to come
by...everything is getting that swingstep mini-breakdown...the bass and
beats are still hard as hell...but the formula needs to change again.

personally the new wave of neurofunk stuff is my cuppa tea these days....ppl
like phace, nosia, pacific, skc, basically the whole armada crew...thats
where its at....its the next step from what ed rush, optical, stakka,
skynet, and k tee were doing 3-5 years ago...better structures, better sound
clarity, even the song writing is better in the case of phace and nosia
compared to ed and optical imho....these are guys that really care about the
music, all have day jobs, and just do it for the love(the reason you should
be making music)


if your talking uk garage in terms of like them importing ny garage in the
late80s early90s....id say thats more of a house thing...when i say garage i
mean like the stuff with the jungle style b-line.

speaking of dubya, I guess he's coming to cleveland this weekend, 
again, durring the national air show.  It will be interesting how 
they handle that, because they're going to piss off A LOT of people 
if they cancel all or part of the air show so dubya can land.

LOL

You must be really out of the loop in regards to Speed Garage. There have
been well over 300 releases in the past 4 years, this past year bringing in
100+ and it keeps growing from week to week.

I am quite intricately involved with this music scene. I network with the
US, UK and Canadian producers whom still make stuff to this day. I get
CD-Rs, test pressings and unreleased promotional tracks because of my statu=
s
in the bassline scene.  I also hunt down rare tunes, for myself, and for
others who are after the cr=E8me de la cr=E8me of SG. My knowledge is quite
extensive!

C=B9mon now, you don=B9t really think that =8Cspeed garage is dead=B9 like others
do. No musical style is ever dead once it is =8Cborn=B9 - YOU may not have hear=
d
anything about it in your area or just for the plain fact that your
knowledge is limited on the subject. People like myself who have been true
to Speed Garage have always been tracking down tunes, and they never
=8Cstopped=B9 getting released ... ever.

It also seems you fall into the majority of people who label 2 step as Spee=
d
Garage, or UK Garage as Speed Garage, when it=B9s far from both. Speed Garage
and 4/4 Bassline are much bigger and different than you think. For instance=
,
check this website -  http://basscutz.com =AD Since Mid-2002 this UK based
site has welcomed over 1800 members from all across the world, who are into
this music as music as myself.


Check =AD http://www.dj-richard.com =AD I consider this man to be my UK
counterpart in the Speed Garage scene, as far as knowledge, tracks, and
exclusivity go.

Check - http://undergroundvinyl.com =AD for my mixes and bio which states my
experience and opinion on Speed Garage, then and now.

Check - http://htfr.com - http://Juno.co.uk - http://baserecords.com - all
of these sites sell newly produced SG tunes listed in the =8Cspeed garage=B9
section.



I could seriously go on and on for longer than you think, but just come dow=
n
to Havana like you said, and I guarantee you you will not hear one familiar
track ;) - I=B9ll even burn you some CD=B9s if you want =AD just let me know so I
can burn some extra ones for you!

Hope to see you there and speak with ya ...

get READY!

speed garage? wild. i still find it fascinating that people still  play
this. new speed garage records havent been made in so long. i  actually
just make a classic 2-step mix tape for my car yesterday,  it made me sad
thinking about how UK garage went downhill. there
are definitely still a couple people around plaing the old 2-step  sounds,
but i listened online to mj cole's label Prolific's new
stuff (i have the very first one from 98, one of my favorite
garage records) and i wasnt too into it. it sucks that garage died  in
almost the exact same way that jungle did.

i might come out tonight for a bit to see whats up with some speed  garage.

tom

son, im not sure what youve been smoking, but youve got to give it 
up. WSJ is as conservative as it comes. read their editorials if 
you dont believe me. as a matter of fact, most economics related 
rags are conservative, if only because its to their interest to 
lessen restrictions on business which is definitely a hard right 
issue. paul krugman is the leading lefty economist, and one of my 
heroes. he shoots holes in all the "educated" nonsense that comes 
out of conservative economic corners.

i dont know if you can call conservative economics un-educated...it took
them a long time to figure out howto screw all of the people all of the
time.

URSULA RUCKER

Without question, Ursula Rucker is one of today's foremost poets.  Having
collaborated with some of music's most sophisticated innovators such as
King Britt,
The Roots,  4 Hero,   Jazzanova,  Masters at Work,  Rob Yancey,  and The
Society,
Ursula Rucker has honed her seductive spoken wordplay inside Philly Soul,
Hip-Hop,
and Nu Jazz-Broken Beat. She combines social awareness with womanhood, black
culture, and love for something musically alluring. A journalism graduate
from
Temple University, Rucker made her poetic debut in 1994 at Philly's
celebrated
Zanzibar Blue.  As word-of-mouth spread through the Philly scene, Rucker
caught the
attention of local globetrotting DJ-producer King Britt who brought her
into the
studio to record the international dance floor classic "Supernatural". 
But it was
after her jaw-dropping track "The Unlocking", a disturbing account of sexual
exploitation, on The Roots' second album "Do You Want More?!" that the
poet and
songstress was brought to the
 attention of an international audience.  Her subsequent follow ups on The
Roots
"Illadelph Halflife" and "Things Fall Apart" and a string of singles with
reknowned
producers 4hero and Jazzanova led Rucker to record her own debut solo
"Supa Sista"
in 2001 and her current release "Silver or Lead", both receiving
international
acclaim from critics in URB, VIBE, XXL, Panache, Blues & Soul  and
Straight No
Chaser magazines. To date, Ursula has performed her work at an array of
venues,
universities and festivals including the Montreax Jazz Festival and the Miami
Winter Music Conference.  Drawing on Influences from the prestigious Black
Arts
Movement activist poet Sonia Sanchez, to Frida Kahlo and Zora Neale
Hurston,  she
has transfixed audiences from Tokyo to Berlin to London alongside the
likes of Gil
Scott-Heron, Mos Def, Macy Gray and the late Dr. Nina Simone.  Her words
are a gift
of power, balancing motherhood, activism and artistry with aplomb.



element 5.  We are dedicated to bringing out the soul of underground
culture in the
city of bridges and helping build a community interconnected with the
elements
beneath the surface. Our goal is to promote collective creativity through
a fluid
intersection of people, places, ideas and vibrations. In doing so, we seek to
connect independent arts and culture to the urban development of
Pittsburgh and
unlock the potential energy through the poetry of people in motion....

MINI m?s are miniature music festivals to test the waters and answer the
question is
Pittsburgh ready for an International Music/Performance Festival along the
likes of
SXSW and the Philly Fringe Fest.  MINI m seeks to foster connections between
Pittsburgh?s regional talent and the international music scene, with an

i wasnt implying that they were uneducated, just that they have a 
pretty transparent reason for the type of thinking they do. 
capitalist economics are not objective, as paul krugman proves on 
a regular basis.

I smoke shit you wish you knew how to grow.  I read the WSJ editorials everyday and know that they cover both sides of the political fence.   They are also "editorials", and do not reside on the front pages of any section.  Point me to a right spun main page story from the WSJ.
 
Here is a sampling of today's journals editorial:
 
"Some Children Left Behind"  -critical of No Child Left Behind policies
"A Job Story" -  critical of the Bush administation sugar coating the US labor problems
 
"Dancing in the Street" - critical of NY GOP protesters
"Moderate Myth" - defends the use of Guiliani and Arnie at the convention
 
 
...check,em out.
 

 


>and hype.

son, im not sure what youve been smoking, but youve got to give it 
up. WSJ is as conservative as it comes. read their editorials if 
you dont believe me. as a matter of fact, most economics related 
rags are conservative, if only because its to their interest to 
lessen restrictions on business which is definitely a hard right 
issue. paul krugman is the leading lefty economist, and one of my 
heroes. he shoots holes in all the "educated" nonsense that comes 
out of conservative economic corners.

Sanctuary - Sunday, Sept. 5th, 2004

Steve Porter

(Bedrock, Balance, Fade, Growroom, djsteveporter.com - NYC)

"So Fresh, So Clean" could be the perfect title for Steve Porter. The
phrase can easily describe his personality, his look, and more
importantly his music. Seamlessly blending the smooth sounds of deep,
tech-influenced house, with the raw emotion of progressive house, the
young phoneme has been raising eyebrows across the globe with his
versatile DJ sets, which he infuses with original production work that
has seen huge support from a myriad of DJ''s including: John Digweed,
Sasha, Carl Cox, Mark Farina, and Derek Carter. Recently completing
warm-up duty on the North American leg of Sasha''s "Involver" tour,
Steve is anxious to bask in the headlining limelight.

Steve Simpson would like to present Pittsburgh with the gift of an
intimate evening with Steve Porter. The experience may just change the
way that you listen to music.

20 Reasons Not to Trust the Journal Editorial Page -
http://www.fair.org/extra/9509/wsj.html 

September/October 1995


20 Reasons Not to Trust the Journal Editorial Page

By Steve Rendall and Jim Naureckas

1. When Anita Hill took a polygraph test to try to substantiate her charges
of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas, the Wall Street Journal
attacked her in an editorial (10/15/91) titled "Credibility Gulch": "Lie
detector tests are so unreliable they are rarely allowed as evidence in
court." 

But just eight months later (6/9/92), when the Journal argued against an
Iran-contra perjury indictment of former Secretary of Defense (and editorial
page contributor) Caspar Weinberger, this was its main evidence for
Weinberger's innocence: "Mr. Weinberger has taken and passed a lie-detector
test on the matter." 

2. Referring to the investigation into the BCCI takeover of the First
American Bank, the Journal asked (10/28/94): "The particular U.S. concern is
discerning how a pack of Arab crooks got control of the biggest bank in
Washington, D.C." 

Besides the blatant racism--it's unimaginable in any context that the
Journal would write of "a pack of Jewish crooks"--BCCI was not run by Arabs.
BCCI's founder, Agha Hasan Abedi, and Swaleh Naqvi, its chief executive
officer, are Pakistani. The Gokal family, which received the largest
defaulted loans, are Indian. The biggest loser in the scandal was the ruler
of Abu Dhabi, an Arab country. 

Deception Overseas 

3. George Melloan, then deputy editor of the Wall Street Journal editorial
page, appeared on the MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour (2/19/82) to explain why the
Journal had vilified the New York Times' Raymond Bonner for reporting on a
massacre of civilians in El Mozote, El Salvador. Melloan insinuated that
Bonner had a "political orientation that is Marxist in nature." Pressed for
evidence, Melloan said Bonner "was covering the guerrilla movement in El
Salvador without ever telling anyone, any of his readers, that he was being
conducted around the country on a tour by the guerrillas themselves." 

As Newsday's Sydney Schanberg pointed out (10/27/92), each of the four
articles that Bonner wrote when he was travelling with the rebels pointed
this out; the first article in the series (1/26/82) was headlined "With
Salvador's Rebels in Combat Zone." 

4. In a letter to the New York Times (4/12/88), Journal editorial page
contributor and former editorial writer Jude Wanniski claimed there was no
evidence linking Salvadoran military officer/politician Roberto D'Aubuisson
to death squads, labeling reports to the contrary as "McCarthyist" and "one
of the most successful propaganda hoaxes of the decade." 

D'Aubuisson's well-publicized ties to death squads have been confirmed by
internal Reagan administration memos. A March 18, 1981 CIA report to
then-Vice President Bush read: "D'Aubuisson has served as principal henchman
for the wealthy landowners and as a coordinator of the right-wing death
squads that have murdered several thousand suspected leftists and leftist
sympathizers during the past year." A July 31, 1985 State Department cable
stated that D'Aubuisson led a meeting in which lots were drawn to decide who
would "win" the opportunity to assassinate Archbishop Oscar Romero, the head
of El Salvador's Catholic Church (Washington Post, 1/4/94). 

5. Journal editorials referred to Angolan guerrilla Jonas Savimbi as "a
veteran of the struggle against Portugal" (11/8/79; 6/30/89) and claimed
that his "UNITA rebels have been fighting for Angola's freedom for 23
years." (12/21/88) 

According to correspondence discovered after the Portuguese military
government fell in 1978, Savimbi was on the Portuguese military payroll as
an agent fighting against genuine anti-colonial forces (Ray et al., Dirty
Work 2; Johnson and Martin, Frontline Southern Africa) 

6. The Journal recently seemed to encourage France to use violence against
Greenpeace in its attempt to blockade French nuclear testing in the South
Pacific: "When confronted by fanatics spouting irrational demands, there is
often no alternative to using force," an editorial declared (7/12/95). 

Greenpeace's "irrational demands"--that the French cease testing nuclear
weapons in the South Pacific--are echoed by the "fanatic" prime ministers of
Australia, New Zealand and Japan, as well as the heads of state of virtually
every Pacific Island country. 

Crime and Punishment 

7. In an editorial on crime (2/11/94), the Wall Street Journal claimed "it
is very nearly routine procedure for criminals to kill their victims during
a robbery to get rid of the evidence." 

According to FBI statistics, there were 672,480 robberies in 1992, and 2,254
murders associated with robberies--so about 99.7 percent of the time,
robbers did not kill their victims. 

8. An editorial page "Notable & Quotable" column (11/13/92) compared "top
problems in the public schools as identified by teachers" in 1940 ("Talking
Out of Turn, Chewing Gum, Making Noise...") and in 1990 ("Suicide, Rape,
Robbery..."). 

The Journal got caught by a hoax which compared two totally dissimilar
lists: One was based on the questions (not the responses) from a 1974-75
poll asking principals about crime in their schools, while the other was
derived from a 1943 list of the most common classroom problems. (The phony
comparison was debunked in the New York Times Magazine, 3/6/94.) In
reprinting the lists (from Congressional Quarterly Researcher, 9/11/92), the
Journal added an error of its own--moving the date of the "modern" problems
from 1980 to 1990. 

Tree Muggers

9. In two editorials (11/18/92, 1/15/93) urging a pardon for Bill Ellen,
convicted in a federal court of violating federal wetlands regulations, the
Journal claimed Ellen had merely been building a "wildlife sanctuary...to
attract migrating waterfowl," and was prosecuted because he had "allowed two
loads of dirt" to be dumped "on land that someone representing the U.S. said
was a wetland," in an area that "the Soil Conservation Service had
previously deemed non-wetland." Ellen, the Journal argued, had been unfairly
charged with "violating a [1989] regulatory standard that didn't exist at
the time of his actions." 

Bill Ellen's "wildlife sanctuary" was actually a hunting reserve. He was not
charged for violating new regulations, but rather on five counts of
violating the Clean Water Act of 1972. Ellen was convicted of filling some
86 acres of clearly wet areas, including part of a tidal creek, a violation
of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1898 (Washington Post, 2/20/93). Ellen had
already received three warnings to stop in 1988--a year before the 1989
regulations were added. According to journalist Bill Gifford in the
Washington Monthly (11/93), "Ellen had filled or altered close to 1,000
acres, though the prosecution focused on areas that were indisputedly wet;
the new wetland definition wasn't even an issue." 

10. "Violating the Endangered Species Act just might be the best thing
Michael Rowe ever did," wrote Ike C. Sugg of the Competitive Enterprise
Institute in an editorial-page column (11/10/93) titled "Losing Houses,
Saving Rats." Rowe saved his house from California's October 1993 wildfires,
wrote Sugg, "by clearing a fire-break" around his property on land
designated as a protected habitat for the Stephens kangaroo rat. Arguing
that 29 other homes within the "77,000 acres of private property" designated
as a kangaroo rat study area could have been saved if their residents had
likewise broken the law, Sugg lamented, "most of Mr. Rowe's law-abiding
neighbors lost their homes." 

Nothing prevented the cutting of brush on private land in the kangaroo rat's
protected habitat, since the animal (a relative of the squirrel) lives
underground. Nevertheless, the U.S. General Accounting Office studied
whether houses could have been saved if homeowners had been allowed to plow
under their land. "Overall, county officials and other fire experts believe
that weed abatement by any means would have made little difference in
whether or not a home was destroyed in the California fire," the GAO
concluded (7/94), noting that the fire, whipped by 80-mile-per-hour winds,
jumped over two highways and a canal. 

11. The Journal launched yet another assault on the tiny kangaroo rat this
year, charging overzealous enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.
Columnist Gideon Kanner ("The Rule of Law," 5/24/95), a southern California
law professor, wrote that Southern California farmer Tuang Ming-Lin was
arrested in February 1994 because he had "run over five rats with a plow."
"Since Mr. Lin speaks no English," Kanner continued, "there is at best a
serious question as to whether he even knew about these regulations, though
the Feds insisted that they had sent letters advising of their existence." 

According to The Recorder (6/14/95), a law publication, Lin was arrested not
for running over rats, but for destroying the protected habitat of three
different endangered species: the Tipton kangaroo rat, the kit fox and the
leopard lizard. According to the Recorder, Lin was sent the first letter
warning him about the protected species in December 1992; the last of
several warnings was conveyed in person, one week before his arrest, by a
game warden who told Lin, his son and the farm foreman that they needed a
permit to continue to cultivate the land. Besides the factual errors, it's
ironic that the Journal would have a law professor--in a column titled "Rule
of Law"--argue that ignorance of the law is an excuse. 

Atomic Bombast 

12. The Journal (8/29/94) blasted the Smithsonian museum's proposed exhibit
on the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, citing the draft script: "It
is especially curious to note the oozing romanticism with which the Enola
show's writers describe the Kamikaze pilots.... These were, the script
elegaically relates, 'Youths, their bodies overflowing with life.'" 

The kamikaze quote was not written by the show's curators but--as was
clearly spelled out in the script--by Yukiteru Sugiyama, a surviving
kamikaze pilot. According to the Smithsonian script, it was "included to
give viewer's insight into [the kamikazes'] suicidal fanaticism, which many
American's would otherwise find incomprehensible." 

13. As evidence of the supposedly soft-on-Japan "mindset" of the Smithsonian
scriptwriters, the Journal editorial (8/29/94) cited this quote: "For most
Americans, this war...was a war of vengeance. For most Japanese, it was a
war to defend their unique culture against Western imperialism." 

Here's the full context of the Smithsonian quote--hardly soft on Japan: 


Japanese expansionism was marked by naked aggression and extreme brutality.
The slaughter of tens of thousands of Chinese in Nanking in 1937 shocked the
world. Atrocities by Japanese troops included brutal mistreatment of
civilians, forced laborers and prisoners of war, and biological experiments
on human victims. 

In December 1941, Japan attacked U.S. bases at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and
launched other surprise assaults against Allied territories in the Pacific.
Thus began a wider conflict marked by extreme bitterness. For most
Americans, this war was fundamentally different than the one waged against
Germany and Italy--it was a war of vengeance. For most Japanese, it was a
war to defend their unique culture against Western imperialism. As the war
approached its end in 1945, it appeared to both sides that it was a fight to
the finish. 


14. In defending the use of the atom bomb, the Journal editorial (8/29/94)
claimed that a U.S. invasion "would by all estimates have resulted in more
than a million American casualties." 

"By all estimates"? Official reports to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in June of
1945 estimated total U.S. casualties (including injuries) as between 132,500
and 220,000. Gen. Douglas MacArthur argued in June 1945 that an estimate of
110,000 casualties was too high. Historians have been unable to provide
documentation for anything close to the "one million" figure (Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists, 6-7/86; Diplomatic History, Winter/93). 

Arcane Reporting 

15. In an editorial (2/5/93) attacking efforts to increase media coverage of
domestic violence, the Journal claimed that FAIR's report that domestic
violence increases on Super Bowl Sunday was "received as sacred writ by an
entirely credulous army of journalists." The Journal praised one reporter,
the Washington Post's Ken Ringle, who wrote an article dismissing any link
between violent sports and domestic violence (Washington Post, 1/31/93): "He
pursued an arcane reporting technique that has apparently slipped from
favor: Mr. Ringle called up the source of the original story to ask if it
were true." 

In fact, Ringle never did call up the source of the story--FAIR's national
office--to ask if it were true. If he had, we would have told him that our
information about the Super Bowl came from first-hand reports from women who
work in domestic violence shelters, and from articles written by journalists
who used the "arcane reporting technique" of interviewing battered women.
One of the reporters specifically cited as part of the "credulous army"
duped by FAIR, Robert Lipsyte of the New York Times, had actually been
reporting about the Super Bowl's link to battering as early as 1987 (NBC
Nightly News, 1/18/87). 

In writing an editorial whose whole point was that journalists should be
skeptical and check their sources, the Journal editors didn't bother to
check the Post's story out by calling FAIR. If they had, they might not have
repeated Ringle's errors, and could have avoided making new errors of their
own--like referring to the public relations firm Dobisky Associates as
"FAIR's publicists," a firm we'd never heard of until the Journal's
editorial appeared. The Journal refused to publish a letter from FAIR
pointing out these and other mistakes. 

Economic Nonsense 

16. Journal editor Robert Bartley's book, The Seven Fat Years, gets its
title from the idea that the Reagan years were a time of great prosperity
compared to the Carter years. Bartley derives this by measuring from the
trough of the early '80s recession in 1982 to the peak of the recovery in
1989--finding a growth rate of 3.8 percent for the "Reagan years"--while
measuring the "Carter years" from the 1973 growth peak to the 1982 trough
(1.6 percent). 

This fundamentally dishonest comparison assigns two recessions--neither of
which occurred during his presidency--to Carter, while counting no
recessions for Reagan. You could find a 3.5 percent growth rate for Carter
by playing a similar game and counting from 1975 to 1980. An honest
economist will tell you that you have to compare similar phases of the
business cycle: From the 1973 peak to the 1979 peak, there was a growth rate
of 2.8 percent; from the 1979 peak to the 1989 peak, there was a growth rate
of 2.5 percent. So much for the "seven fat years." 

17. The Journal praised the 1981 deregulation of the Savings & Loan industry
(6/29/81), saying, "The beauty of these solutions is that they are cheap
because they depend on the market and not on the federal till." 

The federal till has so far paid more than $150 billion to cover the costs
of this "cheap" solution. 

18. Editor Robert Bartley has stated that in the U.S., "there aren't any
poor people, just a few hermits or something like that." (Washington Post,
7/11/82) 

The Limbaugh Connection 

19. Wall Street Journal editorial writer John Fund was the ghostwriter of
Rush Limbaugh's first book, The Way Things Ought to Be. 

The book is wildly inaccurate, as demonstrated in FAIR's book, The Way
Things Aren't. 

20. Republican strategist William Kristol referred to Rush Limbaugh as
"almost a Wall Street Journal editorial page of the airwaves."

I smoke shit you wish you knew how to grow.  I read the WSJ editorials
everyday and know that they cover both sides of the political fence.   They
are also "editorials", and do not reside on the front pages of any section.
Point me to a right spun main page story from the WSJ.
 
Here is a sampling of today's journals editorial:
 
"Some Children Left Behind"  -critical of No Child Left Behind policies
"A Job Story" -  critical of the Bush administation sugar coating the US
labor problems
 
"Dancing in the Street" - critical of NY GOP protesters
"Moderate Myth" - defends the use of Guiliani and Arnie at the convention
 
 
...check,em out.
 

 


>and hype.

son, im not sure what youve been smoking, but youve got to give it 
up. WSJ is as conservative as it comes. read their editorials if 
you dont believe me. as a matter of fact, most economics related 
rags are conservative, if only because its to their interest to 
lessen restrictions on business which is definitely a hard right 
issue. paul krugman is the leading lefty economist, and one of my 
heroes. he shoots holes in all the "educated" nonsense that comes 
out of conservative economic corners.

i just wish i had a record player to listen to my tunes on where i 
live. i rarely if ever feel the need to mix just for fun. ususally 
i just throw together mix tapes for my car when i get tired of 
whatever i have in there at the time...

well since i have NO loot, it makes it damn near impossible to get 
anything. in addition, i dont have a stereo that takes inputs. i 
listen to CDs on a computer or on an alarm clock/radio/cd player. 
as much as i love music, im not really into good stereo systems. 
as long as i can hear it im good to go.

i think its more like riding a bike, you dont really forget how to 
do it. i will say that when i pulled out some old 2-step records 
recently that i had great difficulty playing them right because i 
wasnt used to full vocal songs where you have to wait till the 
right moment to drop the tunes. playing techno and tracky house 
you can pretty much mix whenever you want to, unlike jungle, 2-
step, etc. even still, its not like i couldnt do it, i just got 
really impatient waiting for the right time to mix 2 vocal cuts 
into each other. i forgot how boring it is having your mixing 
dictated to you by your records.

everything has a sweet spot for mixing...i call it the g-spot.

im not even touching the bit about mp3 mixing....that topic has been rinsed
to fuck here.

Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

I agree...Having immediate access to mixing equipment allows a djs 
skills to stay sharp and learn the nuances of the records.  I admit 
that I mixed better in the past when I lived in a one person house 
with a studio and 24/7 access to a dj setup at 100% volume.  I'll 
never forget how to ride the bike, but that doesn't qualify me for a 
Tour de France!

Yeah, true that.

Though ya can't pass up tunes you really like just because the mixes might 
not be exciting... hopefully they will be decent enough for you to not get 
bored because you are satisfied just listening to the record...

I'm excited for this weekend.  It's going to be great for me to get  out of 
West Virginia.  (Actually, everytime I'm out of West Virginia, I'm  happy.  
This place is lame.)  If my music ever takes off, I'll be even  happier.  If God 
be willing, my music will give me a one-way ticket out of  West "Goddammit" 
Virginia.

>bored because you are satisfied just listening to the record...

its cool though, like with 2-step vocal anthems, theyre totally 
the greatest thing ever. you just cant do much with it at all 
unless youre using a nonvocal track. its just a different style of 
deejaying that its easy to forget about if you dont do it often. 
like im used to playing vocal tunes but being able to layer them 
in with other tracks and cut things in and out. playing house and 
techno is so unlike playing other styles of music.

I neglected to mention the name of the venue! I'm mental.

This will be at the Chinatown Inn. I am hearing Turbosound is going to be 
brought in, but I haven't personally confirmed this... more info to come!

Any questions in particular, please contact:

info@digitalgoodtime.com

or my personal e-mail: pax@digitalgoodtime.com

I use to collect them a lot, hardly anymore though.  Just look on your

I don't think there is going to be any camping for this event now that the venue
has been changed to indoors.

Quoting Paul Berezansky <paulberezansky@ameritech.net>:

http://www.labodegadjcamp.com/

just search down the site for paolo mojo's set.

found it using:

www.livesets.com

sign up and start searching the forums.  People upload sets all the time.

I've found a many, MANY great mixes on this site.  I recently even got 8 
hours of video from the 2004 movement festival off of this site - entire 
sets from Rolando, Francsios K, Kevin Saunderson and the Groove Junkies.

It got worse for me since I got serious about production.... now I 
usually spin the tune the way the producer intended, which is boring 
because you know producers are shitty dj's.  Thats one thing I miss 
about dnb between the years of 96 and 99, the arangements were more open 
ended like techno.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} decks and mixer for sale

I always listened to mimimal and techno but one of the strong attractors to 
mixing it was the open ended nature of the sound.  I did spin more 
conventional stuff (harthouse, platipus, hallucinagen) when I was still in 
the learing phases of beatmatching.  It was also a challenge to mix the 
intro and outro together in a fashion where the 2nd track got to the meat 
and the 1st track ended at the same time.  This did get repetitive in a bad 
way after a while.  I have some old dat tapes of some of these mixes I 
should toss up on the net, they are like 6 or more years old. lol.

This Saturday, Sept 11th Capsule is really excited to have:

MIR
For the last 20 years, these guys have compiled an impressive amount of 
gear, and a long list of tracks along the way.  Their sound is, of 
course, reminiscent of Kraftwerk, but add to that New Order, Gary 
Numan, Klaus Schultze, and even Philip Glass for a rich, well composed 
result.  These guys easily carry on where the others may have left off. 
  The best description to date was that for fans of the bands mentioned, 
listening to MIR is like slipping into a comfortable, warm bath.

Trent Hoffmann is the opening act.
This is a FREE show.

somehow i knew that me posting this on the list would create some kind of thread about me/djs not having decks. i don't see myself getting any kind of rusty on the decks because i know lots of people with decks, plus i pretty much have mastered 2 deck mixing. believe me if i had the $$$ i would still keep my gear because i loooooove spinning records! yes i won't be able to spin whenever i want, but my main focus now is on production. i'm still down to spin some cracker-tech wherever possible, but it seems like no one is really interested in hearing it around here anymore......prove me wrong!

in a nostalgia sense only. anyone who would call themselves a

And you thought there was a discussion before.  BTW, you could always 
spin down here in streetstucky.  no one around here anymore, and I 
think I need some new needles or tighten the tonearm or something, but 
I got decks :)   Wonder what parents would say to a house party, this 
from someone who's annoyed enough because my room is still a mess :)

they definitely have become pretty much like prog house now, where 
you have to wait for all the melodies to go away before you start 
mixing in the nonmelodic intro. i guess with basslines like the 
ones you have now you cant really layer or cut up like you could 
with 808 kick sine wave subbass lines back in the day. you could 
easily take 2 tunes and make a new one cutting between them and 
making a new bass melody.

the thing with mixing more modern jungle/dnb is you have to think ahead...if
you are gonna play something that is really subby...why not layer a tune
with reece bass on top of it(it helps if both tunes are in the same
key)...that way you are still cutting shit up live style...but you get the

its not impossible to do layering and whatnot, but you really are 
very limited in comparison to what was possible with the older 
stuff. like you could cut between 2 old tunes, doing it with new 
tunes isnt going to sound good. i always loved playing a more 
steppy joint and adding your own fills off of mashed up records. 
its just not the same. 

just made my mom listen to "the arsonist" and "RIP" yesterday, she 
commented about how much better it was than all other jungle.

Subject: {pb-cle} SRR: SPACElab | 10 Years of Innovation | Sept 10

sort of rave related

friday september 10 :: 5pm-9pm free and open to the public

Back from SPACElab | 10 years of innovation

How do you mark the tenth anniversary of an experiment -- one 
based on challenging traditions? Back From SPACELab: 10 Years of 
Innovation, on view from August 31st through October 15th, 
celebrates the tenth anniversary of SPACELab at SPACES Gallery and 
kicks off the next ten years by affirming the spirit of 
innovation. Back From SPACELab invites ten former SPACELab artists 
to create new installations, which we present alongside 
photographic documentation of their original projects. Join us for 
the opening reception on Friday, September 10, from 5-9pm, with 
guest DJ Deviant of HeadRush Music. Both the opening and the 
exhibition are free and open to the public.

Established in 1994, SPACELab is a program of three-week 
exhibitions that encourage artists, including students, to take 
risks with timely, experimental projects. Because of SPACELab, the 
gallery has offered more than 100 professional and student 
artists, often for the first time in their careers, the 
opportunity to take creative control of a space. The ten alumni 
artists in Back From SPACELab come from across the country and are 
all at different stages in their artistic careers. This project 
asks them to reflect on how their work has evolved and been 
changed by SPACELab, and to continue the dialogue with viewers 
that their original installations began. As in all SPACELab 
exhibitions, the artists are given free reign to create their 
space, take risks, and experiment with new ideas. This time, their 
projects fill the entire 5,500 square foot gallery.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

URSULA RUCKER

Without question, Ursula Rucker is one of today's foremost poets.  
Having collaborated with some of music's most sophisticated innovators 
such as King Britt,  The Roots,  4 Hero,   Jazzanova,  Masters at Work,  
Rob Yancey,  and The Society,  Ursula Rucker has honed her seductive 
spoken wordplay inside Philly Soul, Hip-Hop, and Nu Jazz-Broken Beat. 
She combines social awareness with womanhood, black culture, and love 
for something musically alluring. A journalism graduate from Temple 
University, Rucker made her poetic debut in 1994 at Philly's celebrated 
Zanzibar Blue.  As word-of-mouth spread through the Philly scene, Rucker 
caught the attention of local globetrotting DJ-producer King Britt who 
brought her into the studio to record the international dance floor 
classic "Supernatural".  But it was after her jaw-dropping track "The 
Unlocking", a disturbing account of sexual exploitation, on The Roots' 
second album "Do You Want More?!" that the poet and songstress was 
brought to the attention of an international audience.  Her subsequent 
follow ups on The Roots "Illadelph Halflife" and "Things Fall Apart" and 
a string of singles with reknowned producers 4hero and Jazzanova led 
Rucker to record her own debut solo "Supa Sista" in 2001 and her current 
release "Silver or Lead", both receiving international acclaim receiving 
props from critics in URB, VIBE, XXL, Panache, Blues & Soul  and 
Straight No Chaser magazines. To date, Ursula has performed her work at 
an array of venues, universities and festivals including the Montreax 
Jazz Festival and the 1999 Winter Music Conference.  Drawing on 
Influences from the prestigious Black Arts Movement activist poet Sonia 
Sanchez, to Frida Kahlo, Zora Neale Hurston,  she has transfixed 
audiences from Tokyo to Berlin to London alongside the likes of Gil 
Scott-Heron, Mos Def, Macy Gray and the late Dr. Nina Simone.  Her words 
are a gift of power, balancing motherhood, activism and artistry with 
aplomb.

If you've spent any significant portion of time during the past ten 
years in any club dedicated to underground dance music, it's more than 
likely that you've shaken your ass uncontrollably to the music of David 
Sumner. Although shrouded in pre-release white labels and multiple 
pseudonyms, Sumner's forward musical vision as a producer/remixer and DJ 
has left its indelible influence on the international techno scene 
several times over and continues to redefine the genre's parameters as 
it moves into the 21st Century.

9/26 - RJD2 / Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  - 09/26 - RJD2 
/ Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  Contrary to popular belief, 
heroes sometimes lurk behind the curtains, actively choosing to elude 
visibility. Make no mistake, though-if the mystery man behind the boards 
is the man behind a classic beat, you'll soon know his name. In the late 
90's, producers crept from the shadows to seize the spotlight of 
mainstream hip-hop, as well as the pop charts. In the last few years, 
one man shows such as Moby, DJ Shadow and Timbaland have proved what 
underground hip-hop fans have known since Marley Marl's heyday-a 
talented producer can shine solo. Enter RJD2. From 1998 to 1999, he saw 
success blossom as DJ/producer for the Columbus-based group the 
Megahertz, with two twelve-inch singles on Bobbito Garcia's legendary NY 
label, Fondle 'em records. This explosive entrance to the underground 
hip-hop scene gave way to shows from Europe to Japan, not to mention 
garnering mention in Vibe magazine's "History of Hip-Hop" historical 
volume. Opening doors outside of the east coast, the MHz went on to 
appear on the Bay Area's ABB records compilation, Always Bigger and 
Better, Volume 1. Their contribution (entitled "This Year") was voted 
best track on the ABB website, while competing against major label 
heavyweights such as Dilated Peoples and Defari.

synthy shit in the basement called B Side.

Hello
I will be in the cleveland area saturday afternoon and
was informed of a record shop, but forget the name. 
All i remember is the bag the records were in.  The
bag was brown/black with gold writing and they sealed
the bag with a gold colored sticker.  Any help would
be appreciated!!!

Found this quote interesting:
"The appeals court disagreed, saying a recording artist who 
acknowledges sampling may be liable, even when the source of a sample 
is unrecognizable."

so basically, just use a sample that's mashed up that it can't be 
recognizable, and then don't mention that you sampled it from 
somewhere.

doesnt cut it. really, i think that all these revivals are 
worthless. at this point so many things have happened that these 
things have no context outside of nostalgia. and as nostalgic as i 
can get over great old music, it just isnt a good building block 
for interesting music. i cant stress how wack i find new school 
ragga.

i dunno, tom. i think what it boils down to is the ages old debate about personal context that we've
beaten to death, burned, and had the ashes spread ad nauseum on this list alone.

i think your direct involvement in dealing with that music back in the day prevents you from
accepting a new batch of tunes on their own merits...regardless of whether they were "good" or not,
you couldn't get with the "new girlfriend" because you'd always be comparing her to your "old
girlfriend"....

and really, who's to say that some of these tunes, had they been released in 95, wouldn't be
all-time-greats by now?

Subject: {pb-cle}  URGENT - Ask Congress To Repeal HEA Drug Provision!!!!!!

Please forward this to anyone who might be able to help!


ACT TODAY

CONGRESS TO RECONSIDER BAN ON FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID FOR DRUG OFFENDERS

DISTRIBUTE WIDELY

Friends,

Since its inception, our organization has campaigned against a 1998
amendment to the Higher Education Act that denies federal financial aid to
anyone convicted of a drug-related offense, no matter how minor.  The
provision is counter-productive and causes enormous harm, particularly to
middle- and low-income students who cannot afford the high costs of
college.  Department of Education data indicates that more than 150,000
students have been adversely affected by the provision.

Today, repeal is within our reach.  As part of the reauthorization of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Senate will reconsider the ban
on federal financial aid for drug offenders.  We just learned that the
vote on ONDCP reauthorization is tomorrow.  To make a difference, you must
phone today!

If your Senator is on the Senate Judiciary Committee (below), take one or
two minutes to demand that he or she repeal the ban on federal financial
aid for drug offenders.

YOU MUST ACT TODAY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE!

WHO TO PHONE:

State            Senator(s)          			Phone

California    			Dianne Feinstein (D) 		202-224-3841
Delaware     		Joseph Biden (D)     		202-224-5042
Illinois      			Richard Durbin (D)   		202-224-2152
Massachusetts		Edward Kennedy (D)   		202-224-4543
New York       		Charles Schumer (D)  		202-224-6542
North Carolina 		John Edwards (D)    		 202-224-3154
Ohio          		Mike DeWine (R)     		 202-224-2315
Pennsylvania   		Arlen Specter (R)   		202-224-4254
Vermont       	 	Patrick Leahy (D)    		202-224-4242
Wisconsin      		Russ Feingold (D)    		202-224-5323
                		Herb Kohl (D)        		202-224-5653

WHAT TO SAY:

Hello, my name is __________ and I'm from __________.  I'm calling to ask
Senator __________ to take action tomorrow during the reauthorization of
the Office of National Drug Control Policy and support repeal of the ban
on federal financial aid for drug offenders.

This provision is poorly-designed and causes enormous harm.

PICK ONE TALKING POINT:

- The ban only affects students from low- and middle-income families who
depend on aid to afford college.  Students from wealthier backgrounds who
can afford to pay the full cost of college tuition are unaffected by the
drug provision.

- The ban has a discriminatory impact on minorities.  For example,
African-Americans, who comprise 13% of the population and 13% of all drug
users, account for more than half of those convicted of drug possession
charges.

- The ban punishes students twice for the same crime.  Students have
already paid whatever price the criminal justice system demands of them.
The provision represents an additional punishment that limits a student's
ability to get an education.

- The ban will not solve our nation's drug problem.  To limit the number
of deserving students eligible for federal financial aid is
counter-productive.  Access to a college education is the surest route to
the mainstream economy and a crime-free life.

I hope that Senator ________ will work to repeal this damaging,
discriminatory ban.  Thank you.

Subject: {pb-cle} 1978 Disco Mix -- FINALLY!

I've been promising to get this tape and get it up streamable on the net for 
almost a year now.  This was recorded by a friend of mine live from the 
radio -- 92.3 (then WLYT - Cleveland) in 1978.

The first part of is pretty typical, and very much what you would consider 
disco.  I found the second half to be more enjoyable and a little more 
underground..

While technics 1200 were invented in 1974 -- they were NOT commonplace. 
Disco 108 (another cleveland radio station) used to do a mix show and they 
would use a feather duster propped against the wall to apply pressure to the 
platter to slow down the records to get a small segue of just a few beats. 
Also note that this music was mostly all live instrumentation so the beats 
were not exactly on time to today's computerized and sequenced exactness. 
This meant it was near impossible to lock beats together and mix records as 
we do today, and you heard more "songs" and often long versions.  You will 
hear a lot of "trainwrecks"... but it was the best you could do back then 
without tape editing.

Of the music in the mix, I know 2 or 3 tracks (the beginning is obvious... 
but it does not go where you think).  I think this goes to show a lot about 
where music has been, where it is now, and where it will be in the future. 
Interestingly enough, disco went through phases.  While this mix doesn't 
fully touch it... there were equivalents to today's progressive sound and 
today's trance sound... and of course we all know disco evolved into house 
music.  After disco "died" (and that was a nationwide phenomenon) many 
producers just dropped out of the game.  A lot of them were actually studio 
musicians.  The rest kept the music progressing and went underground to 
create much of what we are familiar with today.  Mainstream perception of 
dance music went in many directions two of which were high energy and funk. 
Rick James, Parliament, and the like are what got played most frequently in 
the old discos.  The thing to know is that while "disco" was dead, dance 
music still had a very big presence in the mainstream all through the 80's 
and into the mid 90's.

http://poo-bas.com/mixes/WLYT_1978_disco_mix.ram is the streaming real audio 
link

http://poo-bas.com/mixes/WLYT_1978_disco_mix.mp3 is the 41 meg download.

Remember it's all just dance music!

Yah, I've read up on this, as I almost had to deal with it. Luckily 
that minor "sheister" offense was expelled of my record (with some glorius 
commie service), but I still am weary of dealing with it again. 
 
I know if the offense isn't surgically cut into you, one can go and do 
some special classes, maybe pay some fines (a good lawyer can't hurt), 
and have it removed, regardless. BUT...I don't exactly shit money or 
free time, and losing my $4k or so in combined state, federal, and local 
financial aid and grants, would not exactly make things easier. 8-)
 
So...I'll save this for later as it would be one of many things that 
would make sense to try and possibly act upon.

ACT TODAY

CONGRESS TO RECONSIDER BAN ON FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID FOR DRUG OFFENDERS

DISTRIBUTE WIDELY

Friends,

Since its inception, our organization has campaigned against a 1998
amendment to the Higher Education Act that denies federal financial aid to
anyone convicted of a drug-related offense, no matter how minor. The
provision is counter-productive and causes enormous harm, particularly to
middle- and low-income students who cannot afford the high costs of
college. Department of Education data indicates that more than 150,000
students have been adversely affected by the provision.

Today, repeal is within our reach. As part of the reauthorization of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Senate will reconsider the ban
on federal financial aid for drug offenders. We just learned that the
vote on ONDCP reauthorization is tomorrow. To make a difference, you must
phone today!

If your Senator is on the Senate Judiciary Committee (below), take one or
two minutes to demand that he or she repeal the ban on federal financial
aid for drug offenders.

YOU MUST ACT TODAY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE!

WHO TO PHONE:

State Senator(s) Phone

California Dianne Feinstein (D) 202-224-3841
Delaware Joseph Biden (D) 202-224-5042
Illinois Richard Durbin (D) 202-224-2152
Massachusetts Edward Kennedy (D) 202-224-4543
New York Charles Schumer (D) 202-224-6542
North Carolina John Edwards (D) 202-224-3154
Ohio Mike DeWine (R) 202-224-2315
Pennsylvania Arlen Specter (R) 202-224-4254
Vermont Patrick Leahy (D) 202-224-4242
Wisconsin Russ Feingold (D) 202-224-5323
Herb Kohl (D) 202-224-5653

WHAT TO SAY:

Hello, my name is __________ and I'm from __________. I'm calling to ask
Senator __________ to take action tomorrow during the reauthorization of
the Office of National Drug Control Policy and support repeal of the ban
on federal financial aid for drug offenders.

This provision is poorly-designed and causes enormous harm.

PICK ONE TALKING POINT:

- The ban only affects students from low- and middle-income families who
depend on aid to afford college. Students from wealthier backgrounds who
can afford to pay the full cost of college tuition are unaffected by the
drug provision.

- The ban has a discriminatory impact on minorities. For example,
African-Americans, who comprise 13% of the population and 13% of all drug
users, account for more than half of those convicted of drug possession
charges.

- The ban punishes students twice for the same crime. Students have
already paid whatever price the criminal justice system demands of them.
The provision represents an additional punishment that limits a student's
ability to get an education.

- The ban will not solve our nation's drug problem. To limit the number
of deserving students eligible for federal financial aid is
counter-productive. Access to a college education is the surest route to
the mainstream economy and a crime-free life.

I hope that Senator ________ will work to repeal this damaging,
discriminatory ban. Thank you.

Long story short, I found the next model of my camera that has a couple 
extra features, high image resolution, bigger lcd, etc and wanted to 
sell my current one while it still has a good resale value and get the 
new one for about $60 more.  So here's the basic info:
Canon A80
4.0 megapixel
comes with 32mb cf card, but you can get larger ones cheap
lcd screen swivels and tilts around
Only like 6 months old, still in excellent physical condition
Taken around 1100 pictures with it
Will include everything that came with it, manuals, cd's, cables, etc
It also has one screen protector on the lcd screen, will include a 
spare one too.
Link to product page:
http://tinyurl.com/37dxo
$250.00
About what they're going for on ebay, without the shipping if your 
close enough.  I'm in Streetsboro, near kent although I go to parties 
in the area so pretty much anywhere in this area.  If your from PA 
you'll have to drive out here or we'll meet halfway or something.  I 
won't actually be selling it till I get the new one, which will be 
sometime next week.
paypal is preferred, but can't use a credit card, only from a checking 
account or something (long story, but there's a reason).  Can also do a 
money order in person.  Hit me up private if your interested.

URSULA RUCKER

Without question, Ursula Rucker is one of today's foremost poets.  Having
collaborated with some of music's most sophisticated innovators such as
King Britt,
The Roots,  4 Hero,   Jazzanova,  Masters at Work,  Rob Yancey,  and The
Society,
Ursula Rucker has honed her seductive spoken wordplay inside Philly Soul,
Hip-Hop,
and Nu Jazz-Broken Beat. She combines social awareness with womanhood, black
culture, and love for something musically alluring. A journalism graduate
from
Temple University, Rucker made her poetic debut in 1994 at Philly's
celebrated
Zanzibar Blue.  As word-of-mouth spread through the Philly scene, Rucker
caught the
attention of local globetrotting DJ-producer King Britt who brought her
into the
studio to record the international dance floor classic "Supernatural". 
But it was
after her jaw-dropping track "The Unlocking", a disturbing account of sexual
exploitation, on The Roots' second album "Do You Want More?!" that the
poet and
songstress was brought to the
 attention of an international audience.  Her subsequent follow ups on The
Roots
"Illadelph Halflife" and "Things Fall Apart" and a string of singles with
reknowned
producers 4hero and Jazzanova led Rucker to record her own debut solo
"Supa Sista"
in 2001 and her current release "Silver or Lead", both receiving
international
acclaim from critics in URB, VIBE, XXL, Panache, Blues & Soul  and
Straight No
Chaser magazines. To date, Ursula has performed her work at an array of
venues,
universities and festivals including the Montreax Jazz Festival and the Miami
Winter Music Conference.  Drawing on Influences from the prestigious Black
Arts
Movement activist poet Sonia Sanchez, to Frida Kahlo and Zora Neale
Hurston,  she
has transfixed audiences from Tokyo to Berlin to London alongside the
likes of Gil
Scott-Heron, Mos Def, Macy Gray and the late Dr. Nina Simone.  Her words
are a gift
of power, balancing motherhood, activism and artistry with aplomb.

Bullshit. Below is the last message I sent to you.

You sit on this list and heckle everyone, hiding behind your 
keyboard pretending to know everything. I kindly offered you the 
chance to prove there's substance behind the talk. If you got 
game, bring it. Too bad you missed your day on the court.

while some of your tunes are not always my kind of thing, i always 
like your breaks and your generally loopy structure. its 
reminiscient of 96-97 era stuff, most definitely. give it some 
time, that era will come into style again and people will be 
looking for that kind of structure, and youll be in there.

never received that. i had suggested the 3rd of sept, was this 
email in reply to that or was it unrelated? 

im not one to talk shit without backing it up. im guaranteed to 
put my money where my mouth is. ive played specialist jungle 
nights in SF, specialist 2-step sets in balitmore, specialist 
hardcore/breakcore for ed luna in columbus, and many other sets of 
all kinds of variety elsewhere. my recent gigs in pittsburgh have 
been playing funk and soul, and dance classics (including a now 
regular every other saturday night at havana with arnie panell). i 
have more than enough shit to back up more shit than i can talk, 
which is quite a bit. i dont know what the fuckup was here with 
the emailing, but i was quite happy to finally get to play the 
kind of sets im playing these days in cleveland. if you want to 
see whats up, lets arrange it right here on the list.

I don't like what most of the doods are trying to pass off of as ragga 
jungle these days, for pretty much the same reason as tom but what I DO 
like is the new dnb comming out with some of those elements of old 
school ragga in them... there is a difference imo.  Take kingston 
vampires by fresh and pendulum, that shit makes me wanna breakdance with 
a red stripe in one hand, but I wouldnt call it ragga.  Or the dubby 
shit like breakage and digital... I wouldnt call that ragga either.

George W's Coke & Booze Claims Resurface

Persistent stories citing George W Bush as a former hardcore cocaine =
fiend and lager lout resurfaced again this week in Kitty Kelley's =
revealing new book "The Family: The Real Story Of the Bush Dynasty".

"Bush did coke at Camp David when his father was President," Bush's =
former sister in law Sharon Bush says in Ms Kelly's latest biography. =
"And not just once either."

Ms Kelley claims the President starting abusing coke during his stint in =
the National Guard in the 60s, dovetailing with allegations made by =
Texas author J.H. Hatfield in his 1998 book "Fortunate Son: George W. =
Bush and the Making of an American President". Mr Hetfield (who died =
several years ago of a reported drugs overdose) claimed Bush was busted =
for possessing coke in 1972 and used family connections to expunge the =
entire record.=20

Though the White House branded the new allegations as 'the same trash =
that was discredited years ago', Bush has never categorically denied =
using cocaine in the 60s, leaving him vulnerable to continuing =
accusations of hypocrisy.  A close confidant of his father Linda Allison =
also described the Republican chief as a  'drunken liability' to his =
father in the 60s, claiming the delinquent president was so out of =
control that he was sent out of Texas to join the Alabama National =
Guard.

"Georgie was raising a lot of hell in Houston, getting in trouble and =
embarrassing the family," Linda Allison told Salon.com. "They just =
wanted to get him out of Houston."

Bush's equally hard-living daughters also made the news this week, =
reportedly spending $4,500 on a vodka binge, with 20 friends in New York =
(an average of  $225 each).

"They probably got through about three bottles of Level vodka," a =
bartender from Chelsea bar 17 told the New York Post, "and they were =
given a tour of the club by management."

http://www.progress.org/archive/drc12.htm ('First he refused to confirm =
or deny it. Later he would say only that 'when I was young and =
irresponsible .. .')

http://www.sonofbush.com/cocaine.htm ('The GOP is setting a bad example =
for the youth of America by endorsing a coke freak for president. It =
sends the message that winning is all that matters . . .')

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR? SRR? 300 DNB Records for sale


I'm cleaning out some of my collection.  Here's what I have for sale:

http://box.412dnb.com/~ratana/ratana-recordsale.htm

It is mostly hard, dark stuff from the last 5 or 6 years.  Nothing wrong
with the records, just running out of shelf space.

Let me know if you want any.  Prices should be $6 per 12", $12 per 2x12"
or something around there.  Obviously some of the more desireable and rare
titles will be more. I just don't have time to price everything
individually.  We can negotiate for sure, I am a very reasonable person...
Just let me know which ones you want.

If you don't live in Pittsburgh, I ask that you try to at least purchase 5
or 6 titles.

After a week or two, anything that hasn't sold I'll probably put up as
lots on ebay.

Adam

theres a definitely difference in quality. most of these newer 
records sound like a parody of ragga jungle to me. half of them 
are remixing old dancehall tunes that already had real ragga 
remixes done back in the day. the comparative wackness of current 
dancehall might also have something to do with it. all i know is 
that i listen to soundmurder's stuff, and then i listen to the 
remarc unreleased dubs 94-96, and its just silly how much better 
remarcs old stuff was. and this was stuff that was weak enough 
that he couldnt get labels to release it at the time!!!!! 

plus the lack of continuity, and youre just looking at a disaster. 
its like being in a coma for 10 years, waking up, and assuming 
bill clinton was still president. its just bad news.

(i know this wasn't supposed to go out on the list, but i have to respond...)

<<When I stick my tunes up for reviews, get people calling it "dj foder" but to me the production
and the jockeying go hand in hand.  I guess not so much anymore :-/>>

well,
1) you are a DJ so you know what works. if you made "armchair techno" or something that wasn't
specifically made for the dancefloor, perhaps that accusation would hold some sort of water.

2) i, personally, really liked the tracks you shared last year (byt and a couple others i can't
think of right now.) i was cleaning up my HD last night and burned your stuff onto a data disc for
archiving, and i popped open byt and was jamming out....

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: hmmm... mushroom cloud over N. Korea ...

http://www.salon.com/news/wire/2004/09/11/north_korea/index.html

Blast, mushroom cloud reported in N. Korea

Sept. 11, 2004  |  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A large explosion occurred
in the northern part of North Korea, sending a huge mushroom cloud into
the air on an important anniversary of the communist regime, a South
Korean news agency reported Sunday.

The South Korean government said it was trying to confirm the report.

The Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified diplomatic source in Seoul,
said the explosion happened at 11 a.m. local time Thursday in Yanggang
province near the border with China. The blast in Kim Hyong Jik county
left a crater big enough to be noticed by a satellite, the source said.

"We understand that a mushroom-shaped cloud about 2.2 miles to 2.5 miles
in diameter was monitored during the explosion," the source said. Yonhap
described the source as "reliable."

Thursday was the anniversary of the 1948 foundation of the communist
regime. Leader Kim Jong Il uses the occasion to stage performances and
other events to bolster loyalty among the impoverished North Korean
population.

Experts have speculated that North Korea might use a major anniversary to
conduct a nuclear-related test, though there was no immediate indication
that the reported explosion on Thursday was linked to Pyongyang's efforts
to develop nuclear weapons.

"It remains unclear whether it was a deliberately planned nuclear test or
it was just an accident," the source in Seoul told Yonhap. "But it doesn't
seem to be an ordinary explosion."

The source said the explosion took place "not far" from a military base
that holds North Korea's Taepo-dong ballistic missiles. North Korea, which
has a large missile arsenal and more than a million soldiers, is dotted
with military installations.

The damage and crater left by the explosion in Kim Hyong Jik county was
big enough to be noticed by a satellite, a source in Beijing told Yonhap.

North Korea was founded on Sept. 9, 1948. Leader Kim Jong Il uses the
anniversary to stage performances and other events to bolster loyalty
among the impoverished North Korean population.

South Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-young said the government
was trying to confirm the report about the explosion.

"I am not aware of details such as the size of the damage," he was quoted
as saying by Yonhap after a National Security Council meeting.

On Saturday, North Korea said recent revelations that South Korea
conducted secret nuclear experiments involving uranium and plutonium made
the communist state more determined to pursue its own nuclear programs.

The South Korean experiments, conducted in 1982 and 2000, were likely to
further complicate the already stalled six-nation talks aimed at
dismantling the North's nuclear development. South Korea has said the
experiments were purely for research and did not reflect a desire to
develop weapons.

On April 22, train wagons at a railway station exploded in the North
Korean town of Ryongchon, killing 160 people and injuring an estimated
1,300, according to some estimates. The blast was believed to have been
sparked by a train laden with oil and chemicals that hit power lines.

The explosion on Thursday was bigger than the Ryongchon train explosion,
which devastated a wide area, Yonhap said.

This is funny.

>From CNN

"a huge explosion shook North Korea's northernmost province on Thursday
producing a mushroom cloud over two miles wide."

"The New York Times reported on Saturday that U.S. President George W. Bush
and his top advisers recently received intelligence reports that could
indicate North Korea is preparing its first nuclear test, citing senior
officials with access to the intelligence."

"Yonhap reported the explosion happened in Yanggang province along the
Chinese border, the site of Yongjori Missile Base -- a large facility with
an underground missile firing range.

According to data gathered by Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), Yongjori is a
suspected site for North Korea's uranium enrichment program."

Now for the kicker: "The U.S. official said the cloud could be the result of
a forest fire."

Blast, mushroom cloud reported in N. Korea

Sept. 11, 2004  |  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A large explosion occurred
in the northern part of North Korea, sending a huge mushroom cloud into
the air on an important anniversary of the communist regime, a South
Korean news agency reported Sunday.

The South Korean government said it was trying to confirm the report.

The Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified diplomatic source in Seoul,
said the explosion happened at 11 a.m. local time Thursday in Yanggang
province near the border with China. The blast in Kim Hyong Jik county
left a crater big enough to be noticed by a satellite, the source said.

"We understand that a mushroom-shaped cloud about 2.2 miles to 2.5 miles
in diameter was monitored during the explosion," the source said. Yonhap
described the source as "reliable."

Thursday was the anniversary of the 1948 foundation of the communist
regime. Leader Kim Jong Il uses the occasion to stage performances and
other events to bolster loyalty among the impoverished North Korean
population.

Experts have speculated that North Korea might use a major anniversary to
conduct a nuclear-related test, though there was no immediate indication
that the reported explosion on Thursday was linked to Pyongyang's efforts
to develop nuclear weapons.

"It remains unclear whether it was a deliberately planned nuclear test or
it was just an accident," the source in Seoul told Yonhap. "But it doesn't
seem to be an ordinary explosion."

The source said the explosion took place "not far" from a military base
that holds North Korea's Taepo-dong ballistic missiles. North Korea, which
has a large missile arsenal and more than a million soldiers, is dotted
with military installations.

The damage and crater left by the explosion in Kim Hyong Jik county was
big enough to be noticed by a satellite, a source in Beijing told Yonhap.

North Korea was founded on Sept. 9, 1948. Leader Kim Jong Il uses the
anniversary to stage performances and other events to bolster loyalty
among the impoverished North Korean population.

South Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-young said the government
was trying to confirm the report about the explosion.

"I am not aware of details such as the size of the damage," he was quoted
as saying by Yonhap after a National Security Council meeting.

On Saturday, North Korea said recent revelations that South Korea
conducted secret nuclear experiments involving uranium and plutonium made
the communist state more determined to pursue its own nuclear programs.

The South Korean experiments, conducted in 1982 and 2000, were likely to
further complicate the already stalled six-nation talks aimed at
dismantling the North's nuclear development. South Korea has said the
experiments were purely for research and did not reflect a desire to
develop weapons.

On April 22, train wagons at a railway station exploded in the North
Korean town of Ryongchon, killing 160 people and injuring an estimated
1,300, according to some estimates. The blast was believed to have been
sparked by a train laden with oil and chemicals that hit power lines.

The explosion on Thursday was bigger than the Ryongchon train explosion,
which devastated a wide area, Yonhap said.

Yea, I'd think that any huge heat source below a column of cooler air could 
create a mushroom cloud.  I'm not 100% sure, but i think that the reason 
that nuclear blasts create mushroom clouds is because of the heat, not some 
type of mysterious "nuclear explosion".

 From Reuters:
N.Korea Says Blast Was for Hydro-Electric Project

SEOUL (Reuters) - A huge explosion in North Korea last week was a 
deliberate blast to pave the way for a hydro-electric dam, Pyongyang said 
Monday.

Washington and Seoul have said the explosion was unlikely to have been a 
nuclear weapons test. South Korean media said an accident at an underground 
munitions depot or a weapons factory was a likely explanation for possibly 
two blasts.

A British minister visiting Pyongyang said late Monday that the North 
Korean authorities had agreed to allow foreign envoys to visit the scene 
and see for themselves.

South Korea's financial markets, which can react sharply to developments in 
the North, had ignored the blast reports, which came as diplomats were 
seeking to persuade Pyongyang to return this month to six-party talks on 
its nuclear weapons programs.

"It was no nuclear explosion or an accident. It was a deliberate controlled 
detonation to demolish a mountain in the far north of the country," a BBC 
correspondent in Pyongyang with British Foreign Office minister Bill 
Rammell quoted North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun as saying.

Britain's Press Association gave similar details in a pool report and 
China's Xinhua news agency quoted a North Korean Foreign Ministry official 
as giving the same explanation.

Paek, who was providing the first North Korean word on the explosion, said 
it was part of a construction project to build a hydro-electric dam in the 
remote mountainous region of Ryanggang on the Chinese border.

The BBC said that when Paek was asked why North Korea had not explained 
earlier about the blasts he told Rammell Pyongyang had not done so because 
all foreign journalists were liars.

Later in the day, Rammell, the most senior British official to visit the 
North, told accompanying journalists that Pyongyang had agreed to let 
Western diplomats visit the site of the blast.

"Having asked the vice foreign minister this morning for our ambassador and 
other ambassadors to be allowed to visit the scene of the explosion, I am 
very pleased the North Koreans have agreed to the request," he said, 
according to a pool report to London.

Rammell added that London's envoy, David Slinn, might be able to visit the 
site as early as Tuesday

I don't just think it's the heat, but a lot of heat really fast, like 
an explosion.  Forrest fire wouldn't because it slowly builds heat, not 
1000's of degrees in less than a second.  I do think that any large 
explosion will do it, not because of nuclear

*update
 From some mailing list archive that had a defintion of how they are 
formed

"In fact, mushroom clouds are not
exclusive to atomic blasts. But their
magnitude makes the resulting cloud larger
and longer lasting than those stemming from
other explosions. Atomic weapons are
detonated above the ground, their explosive
force projecting downward, creating a
parabolic, or curved depression in the
ground below.
    The debris from the curved hole rises
straight upward initially, with the fireball
from the blast ultimately deflecting it
outward as it gains height. Air resistance
at the top of the cloud finally flattens it,
creating its familiar shape. "

so it's not really heat, but all the debris.

Yeah, but last time I checked forest fires don't create 2 mile wide mushroom
clouds.

i think what happens is that since the a-bomb is detonated in the 
air, it sucks up dirt particles from the ground, which it then 
heats up which are then shot upwards into the cool air. if it was 
detonated on the ground i think there would be less of this 
effect. i remember reading about this when i was a child and i was 
obsessed with nuclear war.

i knew it had something to do with it being detonated in the air. 
this sounds reasonably like what i read.....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: hmmm... mushroom cloud over N. Korea ...

considering this is a presidential election year...if N. Korea really set
off a nuke, do you think the bushies would let that out? it is in their
interests right now to make it look like they've contained the nuclear
threat from N. Korea

im not saying it was a nucklear blast, but i am saying we are most likely
not getting the truth...remember, for a modern nuclear weapon to work, you
need a HUGE conventional explosive to start the nuclear reaction(the first
nuclear bombs actually had a small navy gun in them to start the
reaction)...so it is inside the realm of possiblity that N. Korea was
testing the main conventional charge for the nuke and not the actual nuclear
core of the weapon

just my .02

Any leads in the 312?

I found a place that's actually in the midwest and it's actually full of
good-looking young professional types. Now I want to go back there and visit

Subject: {pb-cle} 9/24/04 - NIKOLA BAYTALA of S.W.A.T. - update!

Friday September 24
An Evening with Nikola Baytala of S.W.A.T.
presented by DigitalGoodtime, LLC and Dynamix Crew

Nikola Baytala {S.W.A.T.}, San Francisco

One of San Francisco's true musical treasures, DJ/Producer Nikola Baytala 
has carved his own niche in the urban underground scene. With credentials 
that include 10 years of DJ experience, a successful weekly at The Top 
hosted by his collective, S.W.A.T (Special Weapons and Tactics), and a slew 
of signature tracks produced on labels such as Large, Tummy Touch, 
Nightshift, Soul Food, and Robsoul, Nikola has cemented his status as an A 
List artist with the kind of distinctive style that must be seen to be 
appreciated. Performing alongside artists as far-ranging as Swayzak, Daft 
Punk, and Jane's Addiction, he obviously covers a lot of ground. Defying any 
fixed sub-genre of house music, Nikola has an instinctive need to create and 
play music from the soul while retaining his true grit mentality. His skills 
go beyond impeccable mixing; what sets Nikola aside is his finesse for 
seemless programming, fusing the rarest tech grooves with legendary jack 
tracks, creating long, complex mixes for the dancefloor. When Nikola steps 
up to the decks, he's known for turning things up, keeping the room 
relentlessly vibrating with funky soul-inflicted beats, percussive house 
melodies, techy kicks, and mean basslines. Nikola is an underground legend 
here in San Francisco and his closing sets at virtually every underground 
event since the early 90s earn him his reputation and leave the city 
buzzing!! His dynamic presence winning him aclaim from the likes of Doc 
Martin, Derrick Carter and of course his S.W.A.T. partner in crime, Rasoul. 
Keep an eye out for this rising house phenomenon as he will be coming above 
ground sooner than you might be ready!!

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: get a free ipod

OK, I'm sure you've heard about this, but if not you can get a free 
ipod.  what you do is complete an offer and then refer 5 people.  
well I finally got an offer completed, but still need 4 more people 
to complete it, so I am calling among my fellow music lovers to get 
me a free ipod :)

link:
http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=8116810

The catches:
- only use IE and enable all cookies (then go through and delete the 
cookies after you're done)
- use a throw away email, because you're going to get tons of spam at 
it
- I just did the stamps.com offer.  It's completely free for a month, 
then $15/month afterwards and you get a scale and $5 postage.  And 
it's instantaneous.  I got my notice within an hour or so.  Just make 
sure your using IE, don't stop halfway, and enable all cookies and 
allow popups.  You'll also need a credit card.  I'd leave the account 
open for a week or so before canceling since it looks like they 
cancel people if they immediately cancel the offer.

This is the only place I'm posting this round, for at least a week or 
so.  If I get 4 people to sign up here, I will do whatever the 4th 
person that registers all the way wants me to do (like a dare or 
something.  Has to be within reason, I have my limits you know) or 
they can throw it back to list and have list decide as a whole (hah, 
that's funny) what I should do (again, within reason people).  And 
yes, I am serious about that.  But the 4th and final person must be 
from the list, if not all bets are off.

I am VR, and I approve of this message.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

PORTION REFORM .. live pa aka Function - NY, NY - downwards / 
infrastructure new york

If you've spent any significant portion of time during the past ten 
years in any club dedicated to underground dance music, it's more than 
likely that you've shaken your ass uncontrollably to the music of David 
Sumner. Although shrouded in pre-release white labels and multiple 
pseudonyms, Sumner's forward musical vision as a producer/remixer and DJ 
has left its indelible influence on the international techno scene 
several times over and continues to redefine the genre's parameters as 
it moves into the 21st Century.

Sun Sep 26                          RJD2                          Cleveland

9/26 - RJD2 / Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  - 09/26 - RJD2 
/ Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  Contrary to popular belief, 
heroes sometimes lurk behind the curtains, actively choosing to elude 
visibility. Make no mistake, though-if the mystery man behind the boards 
is the man behind a classic beat, you'll soon know his name. In the late 
90's, producers crept from the shadows to seize the spotlight of 
mainstream hip-hop, as well as the pop charts. In the last few years, 
one man shows such as Moby, DJ Shadow and Timbaland have proved what 
underground hip-hop fans have known since Marley Marl's heyday-a 
talented producer can shine solo. Enter RJD2. From 1998 to 1999, he saw 
success blossom as DJ/producer for the Columbus-based group the 
Megahertz, with two twelve-inch singles on Bobbito Garcia's legendary NY 
label, Fondle 'em records. This explosive entrance to the underground 
hip-hop scene gave way to shows from Europe to Japan, not to mention 
garnering mention in Vibe magazine's "History of Hip-Hop" historical 
volume. Opening doors outside of the east coast, the MHz went on to 
appear on the Bay Area's ABB records compilation, Always Bigger and 
Better, Volume 1. Their contribution (entitled "This Year") was voted 
best track on the ABB website, while competing against major label 
heavyweights such as Dilated Peoples and Defari.

Fri. October 15 @ The Eye - ages 18 , 7pm

DigitalGoodtime.com, Brighton Music Center and Shure proudly present:

SHORTKUT of the World Famous Beat Junkies![/color]

That's right y'all, SHORTKUT is coming to Pittsburgh. Shortkut will be 
performing a FREE 20 minute demo at Brighton Music Center on Babcock 
Boulevard, showing aspiring turntablists scratch techniques and possibly 
also demo-ing the Rane Serato Scratch machine, Rane's answer to 
Stanton's Final Scratch. This will be followed by autographs, giveaways 
and raffles (featuring the needles described later). Then in the 
evening, SHORTKUT will be performing a full-length set at THE EYE on 
Penn Avenue and the raffle winners will be announced. Only those 
attending Brighton's demo will be given raffle tickets for the needles, 
but all get the free goodies. Winners of the raffle will be announced @ 
The Eye later that night, and only those at The Eye are eligible to win. 
In short, you gotta be at both performances to win these needles, but 
they're well well worth it...

Giveaways at Brighton from Shure will include a raffle for a pair of 
M447 scratch needles (the industry benchmark and praised for their 
quality; endorsed by the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Beat Junkies, 
X-Ecutioners, DJ Craze and more), t-shirts, stickers and more. In 
addition, we have swag from Odyssey, Rane, Brighton Music Center, 
Digital Goodtime, LLC and more...

More info to be posted as it becomes confirmed, so check back!

http://www.digitalgoodtime.com/flyers/2004/shortkutwebback.jpg

from Beatjunkies.com:

Shortkut began his DJ career is 1987 with Just 2 Hype!, a DJ crew based 
out of Daly City, California. In 1994, Shortkut, together with QBert and 
MixMaster Mike, formed the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, a legendary turntable 
band that heralded a new era in the DJ/turntablist world, and helped 
raise this musical art to its new form. Later that same year, J.Rocc, 
the "Funky President" of the Beat Junkies, invited Shortkut to join 
their internationally acclaimed collective, based out of Los Angeles. 
Shortkut's addition to this musical group has diversified the Beat 
Junkie audience to new realms....

I hear a lot of that listening to tracks and my guess is that Snoop probably
sampled it from someone whom Paradox also sampled from.  I've found that to
be the case more often than not.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} NRR: get a free ipod

Search around the intarweb this is a scam.  Your chances of getting one are
about the same as mysteriously finding money in the exact amount of the cost
of an iPod in your ass one morning.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: get a free ipod

OK, I'm sure you've heard about this, but if not you can get a free 
ipod.  what you do is complete an offer and then refer 5 people.  
well I finally got an offer completed, but still need 4 more people 
to complete it, so I am calling among my fellow music lovers to get 
me a free ipod :)

link:
http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=8116810

The catches:
- only use IE and enable all cookies (then go through and delete the 
cookies after you're done)
- use a throw away email, because you're going to get tons of spam at 
it
- I just did the stamps.com offer.  It's completely free for a month, 
then $15/month afterwards and you get a scale and $5 postage.  And 
it's instantaneous.  I got my notice within an hour or so.  Just make 
sure your using IE, don't stop halfway, and enable all cookies and 
allow popups.  You'll also need a credit card.  I'd leave the account 
open for a week or so before canceling since it looks like they 
cancel people if they immediately cancel the offer.

This is the only place I'm posting this round, for at least a week or 
so.  If I get 4 people to sign up here, I will do whatever the 4th 
person that registers all the way wants me to do (like a dare or 
something.  Has to be within reason, I have my limits you know) or 
they can throw it back to list and have list decide as a whole (hah, 
that's funny) what I should do (again, within reason people).  And 
yes, I am serious about that.  But the 4th and final person must be 
from the list, if not all bets are off.

I am VR, and I approve of this message.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} NRR: get a free ipod

I first thought that too.  Till I saw an article on wired ( 
http://tinyurl.com/6oa2e ) that they actually interviewed the people 
doing it and there's plenty of quotes and how it works and stuff.  
Kevin rose from the screen savers had some doubts ( 
http://tinyurl.com/6lum5 ) which were later eliviated when he got his 
gift certificatenot even a month later ( http://tinyurl.com/5okmd ).

go ahead and google it yourself, 'freeipods scam' (without the 
quotes). not a single one in the top 10 say it's a legitimate scam 
where you don't get anything.  And I also did the google recommended 
'free ipods scam' (without quotes) and STILL no bad ones in the top 
10.  So I searched, and I'm still convinced this is legit, so b'oh.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: get a free ipod

I'll believe the right and right amount of people got the ipod to prove 
it scam worthy enough is false when me shit turns purple and smells 
like rainbow sherbet. There HAS to be a line where profit wins over 
fucking people over, look at the ford pinto.

BTW, everyone who buys into this, i have a nice time share under a 
bridge in new york that's also for sale.

- meh

oops, I swore, isn't that against list rules?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: get a free ipod

guy at work, his buddy has one.  i'm about there.  so we'll see.  they 
bank on people trying and giving up after a bit.  it is a major asspain 
to get 5 people to do the offers.   they now have a free flatpanel one 
that needs 8 ppl, same types of offers....

watch out for the "product test panel" ones.....  the one on myspace 
advertising a free laptop for taking part in their "test panels"....  
there is no free stuff, lots of spam and they aren't really easy to do, 
and you'll be better off just buying a laptop.  how that one works is 
you need to do 6 offers in three groups.  the first 2 groups aren't bad, 
but when you get to the 3rd group, they only have 3 offers, and they all 
are expensive......  1 year contracts to satellite dishes (2 different 
companies, so you need a dish, plus service)  and the 3rd offer was an 
investment in some canadian mail order company.  huh??

shit, i forget.  i'll have to fucking dig out the rules and look.

i've read enough blog reports to know its possible to get the ipod.  its 
just a PITA to get ppl to go thru with it.  if you read the wired 
article it says that advertisers are willing to pay 50-60$ for a 
customer that goes directly to them.  not sure how that works out since 
everyone i've talked to cancels whatever offer they have right off so 
they don't get charged or get charged as little as possible.

i lucked out and did a free one, all i needed was a CC to verify, they 
never charged it.  woot!

Yeah, I did the ancestry.com one and cancelled my trial today (the last  
day) over the phone.

No big thang.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} samples

i think paradox sampled the snoop track, cuz the paradox track came out
after the snoop track....dre produced the snoop track, and everyone knows
that dre is the master of the clavinet...paradox threw the clavi sound into
his sampler and found a good loop point and time stretched it a little.

Subject: {pb-cle} Technoir Audio 005 and 006 White labels avaliable exclusively at Submerge

Technoir Audio is proud to present Shawn Rudiman's "Synthesexual" 
two-part
vinyl and CD release.

TNA-005 Shawn Rudiman "Synthesexual Part 1" will be released Early
October.  Audio clips:

  http://technoir.lucasowens.com/audio/tna005-aa3.ram

TNA-006 Shawn Rudiman "Synthesexual Part 2" will be released 
Early/Mid
November (so get those promos while they're hot, this one won't be 
out for
a while).  This includes a vinyl-only bonus cut (side aa1).

The CD is a 15 track album with many tunes not on the vinyl.  This 
will be
out when TNA-006 is released.

Promos available at submerge.. there aren't that many copies 
available
though, so you snooze you lose :)

www.submerge.com --> e store --> somewhere in detroit --> technoir 
audio
also see under new releases.

Good luck but I think if you do the math the longer the program exists the
less likely you are to get one before the company cashes out and disappears.
I've read about several schemes exactly like this and none of them ended
well.

Yeah, I did the ancestry.com one and cancelled my trial today (the last

Subject: {pb-cle} 10 hours, 10 djs #11 (This Sunday)

SUNDAY::AUGUST 26::CLEVELAND

A FREE monthly showcase of Cleveland area dj talent:

10 hours, 10 djs.  (part 11)

This month we have five new djs in the mix, and we are bringing back five 
favorites.

4:30-5:30::: NICOLE
5:30-6:30::: DAN BOLTON
6:30-7:30::: TRYZUB
7:30-8:30::: JUGOE
8:30-9:30::: JAY STONE
9:30-10:30::: QUEST
10:30-11:30::: DAVID BISHOP
11:30-12:30::: MIKE FILLY
12:30-1:30::: DJ TWO
1:30-2:30::: STILL LIFE

We have a GREAT lineup this month, and lots of good music all day from start 
until finish.  Expecially if you like house, like Trout does <j/k... if you 
are overwhelmed with house stop down late and you wont' have to hear much of 
it)!   Start time is 4:30 pm. You can go out EARLY if you can't stay out 
late, or you can go for the marathon like others have been doing lately :) 
Plus it's FREE!!

There is a "Make your own Bloody Mary Bar" in effect from 1pm on. This is 
great hair of the dog, and a good way to start the afternoon.


All taking place at:

TWIST SOCIAL CLUB
11633 Clifton Blvd.
Cleveland-Lakewood, OH
216.221.2333

**We welcome any other types of artists at these events. If you want to 
express yourself, please email doug@poo-bas.com to discuss it. We would like 
this to be an open forum for many different types of talent.

** If you are an area dj wishing to play these events -- we ask that you 
stop down and see if this is something you are into doing.  It is for free, 
and for fun.  After you find out what its about get in touch with 
doug@poo-bas.com and we'll get you on the lineup.   Right now we are looking 
to use 10 fresh faces in December.

___UPCOMING___

OCTOBER 3:  STOUT XTC and CANDICE RADIN are celebrating their birthdays. 
The dj lineup so far includes Doug Burkhart and Robb Mengay... the rest is 
forthcoming :)

OCTOBER 26:  10 hours, 10 djs (Pt 12 - The Kent/KSU edition).  All djs who 
attended Kent or are from the area.

OCTOBER 31:  Halloween.  Hmm.....

Hi, I just moved to ohio not long ago, and I live probably about 2 hours

so... which is why I signed up for this mailing list... any advice?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} New in the area

it's great to have someone new around but the only "raves" that are around
here are in columbus there are some club nights in cleveland but nothing to
get worked up over. not because no ones tried its just that no one is left
but us. maybe like 100 people if we count you 101. anyway welcome aboard.
everyone is friendly here, mostly you got to watch out for tom cox and dj
entropy. they don't bite but they like pulling your strings im sure they
will be kind to you on your first day. but just so you know dj entropy is
the best dj in the world and tom cox is the smartest. see you around!

.
What makes most people feel happy, Leads us headlong into harm. So, in my
bedroom in those 'ugly new houses' I danced my legs down to the knees, But
me and my 'true love' Will never meet again ...

At the record company meeting, On their hands - at last! - a dead star! But
they can never taint you in my eyes... No, they can never touch you now.
No, they cannot hurt you, my darling, They cannot touch you now. But me and
my 'true love' Will never meet again...=B2

Can't speak about raving anymore, but I can tell you about one venue 
that's making an effort to provide a nice outlet for good underground 
electronic music--we tend to focus on electro, techno, tech-house, and 
some peripheral sounds as well.  Capsule, in Lakewood--a stone's throw 
from Cleveland's west border has weeklies and shows w/ live acts and 
DJs.  We're tiny, but cool as hell, and for the most part it's free to 
get in.

Don't rely on bland commentary from people who are bored with living 
here.  You should know that Cleveland offers many choices for those 
with a broad range of interests--and few for those with narrow 
interests.  I'm not one of the broadest minds in town when it comes to 
music, but I think you could probably start by checking out local 
online forums (clevelandnightlife.com?) and local rags (freetimes.com, 
cleveland scene--google that, I don't remember the site.) to find 
events you might be interested in.  I could list all the names I see 
pop up on this list of people/venues that do things around here, but 
I'd be doing them a great disservice, as I don't know much about them 
due to my own narrowed interests.  It seems to me though, just from 
dropping off flyers lately, that Grand Poobahs record store could be a 
good place to start, and meet local people who share your interests.  
They've developed a rep over the years for being the local "rave 
central".  That shouldn't be surprising as record stores are often the 
center of their respective local scenes.  And even though Doug (hi 
doug;) doesn't sell Solvent (yet), anyone interested in being 
introduced to my narrow musical point of view should come check him 
(Solvent) out on the 6th with Lusine and Travelogue at, guess where!, 
Capsule.  Check site for more info.

Ciao,
Cathryn Sunday

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Russ Meyer died

http://www.salon.com/ent/wire/2004/09/22/meyer/index.html

Pioneer adult filmmaker Russ Meyer dies
- - - - - - - - - - - -
LOS ANGELES (AP)

Sept. 22, 2004  |  Russ Meyer, producer-director who helped spawn the
"skin flick" with such films as "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" and later
gained a measure of critical respect, has died. He was 82.

Meyer died Saturday at his home in the Hollywood Hills, according to his
company, RM Films International Inc. Spokeswoman Janice Cowart said Meyer
had suffered from dementia and died of complications of pneumonia.

Meyer's films were considered pornographic in their time but are less
shocking by today's standards, with their focus on violence and
large-busted women but little graphic sex.

Altogether he produced, directed, financed, wrote, edited and shot at
least 23 films, including his debut, "The Immoral Mr. Teas," in 1959 and
the 1968 film "Vixen," whose success earned him notice from major studios.

He went on to direct the major studio release "Beyond the Valley of the
Dolls", which was co-written by film critic Roger Ebert.

In a 1996 interview with The Associated Press, Meyer described his films
as "passion plays ... beauty against something that's totally evil."

Meyer was unapologetic for his movies, arguing the onscreen female nudity
put customers in theater seats. But he maintained that women liked the
films.

"The girls kick the hell out of the guys. I've always played well at the
Ivy League -- Cornell, Dartmouth. I have never encountered a berating
woman," he said.

Meyer's work made him rich and earned him acclaim. He was honored at
international film festivals and his movies were discussed in college
courses. Even critics who disliked his movies often found something
positive to note.

New York critic John Simon derided "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" as
"awful, stupid and preposterous" but said the film was "also weirdly funny
and a real curio, rather like a Grandma Moses illustration for a work by
the Marquis de Sade," according to Halliwell's Film and Video Guide.

His 1966 film "Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!," about three go-go girl club
dancers who go on a vengeful murder spree against the men who did them
wrong, still makes the art house rounds.

"This film is not derogatory to women," Meyer said. "There were three
tough cookies to deal with. Besides, they get what's coming."

"Stag films were the earliest version of pornographic movies, but then
they got hard-core, and I didn't," he told the AP. "Mine are put-ons,
send-ups, humorous. I think I've got an ability to provoke, be teasing, be
provocative.

"It's all a joke."

Born in Oakland, Meyer got his start in film as a young boy when his
mother bought him an 8 mm camera. As an adult, he made training films with
the Army Signal Corps in World War II and then shot newsreels in France
and Germany. He made industrial films for Standard Oil and lumber
companies before making his own films.

Meyer was married three times, including to actress Edy Williams. His
studio said he left no survivors.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} This Saturday@Havana - SOY SOS

BTW, on alternating saturdays now at havana (aside from this one) 
are me and arnie panell alternating with my boy anthony. were 
playing a mixture of classics and obscurities in these genres: 
ska, dancehall, funk, soul, disco, house, techno, hiphop, r+b, 
80s, etc, and even some straight up rock type stuff in the first 
hour. me and arnie are the week after the soysos thing, then is 
anthony, etc etc. people should come out, its a good time, and 
thus far a really weird crowd.

i've only seen soy sos once that i really really remember, it was some 
house party on 5th or forbes between downtown and oakland.   it was a 
hell of a blurry night and it ended in a few paddy wagons coming and 
breaking up the fun.  i high tailed it out before things could get 
uglier.   wheeeeeee.

hes an interesting deejay, he'll play lots of 70s afrobeat and 
latin stuff, as well as dubby stuff and newer NYC style house and 
some broken beats. not the most technical deejay, but who gives a 
shit? 

he also was the emcee on 187's first record in 1995, rock stone 
foundation on jungle sky. when i met him and realised he was a 
white dude, i was speechless. he also has this really ill tattoo 
of the old king tubby's logo of a guy looking like colossus from 
the fantastic 4 throwing a dubplate into a grave for them dead 
soundbwoys. 3 generations walking is his and mkl's band, their 
album has had tracks remixed by francios k and has been reviewed 
in straight no chaser and many other good magazines....

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

If you've spent any significant portion of time during the past ten 
years in any club dedicated to underground dance music, it's more than 
likely that you've shaken your ass uncontrollably to the music of David 
Sumner. Although shrouded in pre-release white labels and multiple 
pseudonyms, Sumner's forward musical vision as a producer/remixer and DJ 
has left its indelible influence on the international techno scene 
several times over and continues to redefine the genre's parameters as 
it moves into the 21st Century.

Sun Sep 26                          RJD2                          Cleveland

9/26 - RJD2 / Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  - 09/26 - RJD2 
/ Diplo / Copywrite - 9pm $10 adv / $12 dos  Contrary to popular belief, 
heroes sometimes lurk behind the curtains, actively choosing to elude 
visibility. Make no mistake, though-if the mystery man behind the boards 
is the man behind a classic beat, you'll soon know his name. In the late 
90's, producers crept from the shadows to seize the spotlight of 
mainstream hip-hop, as well as the pop charts. In the last few years, 
one man shows such as Moby, DJ Shadow and Timbaland have proved what 
underground hip-hop fans have known since Marley Marl's heyday-a 
talented producer can shine solo. Enter RJD2. From 1998 to 1999, he saw 
success blossom as DJ/producer for the Columbus-based group the 
Megahertz, with two twelve-inch singles on Bobbito Garcia's legendary NY 
label, Fondle 'em records. This explosive entrance to the underground 
hip-hop scene gave way to shows from Europe to Japan, not to mention 
garnering mention in Vibe magazine's "History of Hip-Hop" historical 
volume. Opening doors outside of the east coast, the MHz went on to 
appear on the Bay Area's ABB records compilation, Always Bigger and 
Better, Volume 1. Their contribution (entitled "This Year") was voted 
best track on the ABB website, while competing against major label 
heavyweights such as Dilated Peoples and Defari.

SHORTKUT in Pgh, Oct.15, ages 18+

Fri. October 15 @ The Eye - ages 18 , 7pm

DigitalGoodtime.com, Brighton Music Center and Shure proudly present:

SHORTKUT of the World Famous Beat Junkies![/color]

That's right y'all, SHORTKUT is coming to Pittsburgh. Shortkut will be 
performing a FREE 20 minute demo at Brighton Music Center on Babcock 
Boulevard, showing aspiring turntablists scratch techniques and possibly 
also demo-ing the Rane Serato Scratch machine, Rane's answer to 
Stanton's Final Scratch. This will be followed by autographs, giveaways 
and raffles (featuring the needles described later). Then in the 
evening, SHORTKUT will be performing a full-length set at THE EYE on 
Penn Avenue and the raffle winners will be announced. Only those 
attending Brighton's demo will be given raffle tickets for the needles, 
but all get the free goodies. Winners of the raffle will be announced @ 
The Eye later that night, and only those at The Eye are eligible to win. 
In short, you gotta be at both performances to win these needles, but 
they're well well worth it...

Giveaways at Brighton from Shure will include a raffle for a pair of 
M447 scratch needles (the industry benchmark and praised for their 
quality; endorsed by the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Beat Junkies, 
X-Ecutioners, DJ Craze and more), t-shirts, stickers and more. In 
addition, we have swag from Odyssey, Rane, Brighton Music Center, 
Digital Goodtime, LLC and more...

More info to be posted as it becomes confirmed, so check back!

Day Venue: Brighton Music Center, 2110 Babcock Blvd.
Night Venue: The Eye, 4814 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA
Age: All Ages @ Brighton, 18 @ The Eye

http://www.digitalgoodtime.com/flyers/2004/shortkutwebback.jpg

from Beatjunkies.com:

Shortkut began his DJ career is 1987 with Just 2 Hype!, a DJ crew based 
out of Daly City, California. In 1994, Shortkut, together with QBert and 
MixMaster Mike, formed the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, a legendary turntable 
band that heralded a new era in the DJ/turntablist world, and helped 
raise this musical art to its new form. Later that same year, J.Rocc, 
the "Funky President" of the Beat Junkies, invited Shortkut to join 
their internationally acclaimed collective, based out of Los Angeles. 
Shortkut's addition to this musical group has diversified the Beat 
Junkie audience to new realms....

about Tim Skinner:
While Tim Skinner has been an established figure in Florida's dance 
scene since the early 90's, 2002 was the year he showed the rest of the 
world his true abilities by filling in for Jimmy Van M as he took on 
opening duties for the Delta Heavy - a 40-city tour across North America 
featuring Sasha & John Digweed.

Later that year, Tim toured with John Digweed on Moby's Area 2 Tour 
featuring David Bowie and again demonstrated his talent to fans in 14 
cities throughout North America. Since then, Tims travels have 
regularly taken him beyond the borders to locales such as Central and 
South America where he has built quite a loyal following.

When not traveling, Tim can be found working diligently in the studio. 
He and Barry Robb (aka Sphere) founded Grounded Music, which features a 
number of his studio productions. Other production work and remixes from 
Tim can be found on leading record labels throughout the globe. Most 
recently, Tim partnered with Martin Accorsi to produce an EP slated for 
an end of summer release on John Digweeds Bedrock Records. To follow 
Tims continued presence in dance music, visit:

Subject: {pb-cle} Announcement: PoH not throwing FTV on Oct 30

Pursuit of Happiness has CANCELLED our participation in Fuck the Vote on 
October 30, 2004.

Our events often involve cooperation between members of our own core 
group and others. When differences of opinion exist, we try to 
compromise as much as possible to ensure that everyone is satisfied with 
what we would accomplish. In this case, we came to a simple 
determination that the necessary compromises would fail to accomplish 
our goals, and so we have withdrawn.

Note that there are no hard feelings on our part, and the hard work that 
went into making this event take place is something we respect and we 
will give full support if and when we may be asked to do so. The name of 
the party may change, the line-up we had been prepared to announce may 
change, even the date and venue we intended to use may change, any and 
all details are no longer our decisions to make. It is not our party 
now, it will not be a PoH event.

I am sorry to all of those who were looking forward to this.

Subject: {pb-cle} Bad, BAADD gig story...

I wanted to share with you all my gig I had in my hometown in Charleston, WV 
last night.  You guys can provide feedback sometime. I've been heavily 
involved in production & grad school right now.  So I've been unable to hit 
the road like I want to.  Otherwise, I'd be partying with all ya about every 
weekend. 

But this party was bad.  I had a better time at the Tribute to 911 party than 
I had here.  I've had a great time in every other town I've been, whether as a 
DJ or as a music lover.  It seems like I have a great time in every town 
except for Charleston.  It's only in my hometown where I put up with this shit.

I had suspicions coming into this party.  Another guy was going to spin at 
this party and told the person who was running it about me. I get a phone call 
about 3 days ago.  I had no time to get information about anything, but I 
offered to do it as a way to expose my music here.  This party turned out to 
be an under-18 house party.  Had I known what part of town I was being asked 
to spin, I probably would've sent a demo CD instead of showing up. The party 
was in a section of Charleston that was full of thugs and holagons.  I told 
the person who booked that the only music I have is techno, and if there's 
going to be a problem, let me know so I don't have to waste my time.  If I ran 
into any problems related to my music, I'll walk.  The police department was 
close by to this house party, so I was getting a little worried what I was 
getting into.  
 
I decided to do the courtesy of unhooking my equipment at my house to spin at 
this party.  Things run a little different here in Charleston than anywhere 
else.  This place is oh so far behind.  I told the person to make damn sure he 
had an amplifier & some speakers because I'm currently shut down.  I ran into 
conflicts as soon as I walked in the door.  When I arrived, I was expecting an 
amplifier so that I could hook my stuff up.  Didn't turn out that way.  I 
tried to hit Radio Shack, but they closed as soon as I arrived.  I had to work 
with a 30-watt guitar amp that I bought that sounds like shit.  I wasn't even 
going to hook up my equipment.  I was going to go home.  But I decided to do a 
favor anyway and hook my equipment only because it was someone's birthday 
party.  

Things just got worse.  A woman asked me to start to DJ because the current DJ 
wouldn't play the kids' CDs.  I responded, "We're going to have a problem, 
because I don't play CDs neither."  Then I began to play my set.  The same 
woman cut me off during my first song because she suspected someone was 
drinking.  It turned out to be a "so-called" Christian party.  Whatever!  She 
was cursing all to Hell.  I didn't know what was going on, but if I was going 
to put up with this shit, I was leaving.  I wasn't planning on babysitting 
anyone.  I would've had a better night recording my set at home on a Saturday 
night than putting up with all of this mess.

Like I said, the place was actually 18 and under.  The person who was throwing 
the party told me to get the other DJ out of there because he was an asshole 
and wouldn't play anyone else's music.  I got the same damn response when I 
began to play my set.  One asshole (black boy) had the nerve to walk up to me 
and make this comment: "That techno shit ain't gonna work in here.  You need 
to go to the white people's party or the gay club..."  Being a straight, black 
guy, I nearly took the boy's head off.  There were other people complaining 
throughout the short evening.  The crowd was just about all black people.  
People here are sadly close-minded, stereotypical, and racist.  I'm glad music 
ignores such barriers.

I'm going to look back at that boy's comment and laugh my ass off around this 
time next year after my music starts getting released in my name.

Since the kids wanted to be a bunch of punks, I eventually unhooked my stuff 
and left.  I killed the party.  I know, that's an asshole move, but Fuck'em.  
I hate being a bit of an asshole walking out in the middle of the party, but 
Fuck'em.  I'd probably get shot and my equipment destroyed anywhere else.

 Charleston is lost when it comes to Techno/House.  It's a shame.  People 
say, "Life is what you make out of it," right?  Well, I've been trying to make 
the best out of a bad situation while I'm here in Charleston.  I'm trying to 
break House music into this area until I get my Master's degree.  After that, 
I'm getting the Hell out of here. But this was a mistake that I will hopefully 
never make again.

But I just thought I'd share that bad experience with you all.  Encouragemetn 
is appreciated.  Peace out!

90% of that lineup has signed a contract to play at all the ILT's till at
least 2007. Among the free agents, its interstingly weird to see the Prodigy
playing the green room, and way cool to see whos doing live PAs, including
DAVE bangyourmom CLARKE.

I've gotten that here in Columbus. I don't need ner west virginians 
tellin me off when I can have it done in my own back yard. (Yes, I am 
the child of west virginians).

"Just bring whatever" is a phrase that makes me run in the other 
direction, "I have only techno" is something that passes through the 
ears of many totally unheard. I've had the unfortunate scenario where 
I've even busted out xmix top 40 house mixes only to be told "no 
techno, play the stuff on the radio", after being told weeks before 
hand that  "whatever you have is ok".

I find Leo Laker is lost on a lot of people anyway, but I'm never 
caught with my pants down anymore (except in the right circumstances 
ladies ;) ). Since experience dictates a handful of really bad xmix 
cd's aren't even going to hit it off in those occasions, I actually hit 
the Disney Radio top 10 and prepare for the worst before I leave the 
house.

Which brings me to the equipment aspect. Yeah, doing all that usually 
means I have to drag out two decks, two axis 9's and a crap load of 
other stuff when you have that sorta thing, which is a shitload of 
work. Going through two changes of clothes isn't unheard of for me. 
After the few times I've played the unknown-for-the-most-part venue, I 
will never, ever, ever, ever, do it again. One time even, what I 
thought was going to be a wicked show on the Ohio State campus, I had 
this reinforced yet again. No one will help you lug your shit, and in 
most cases, you don't want them to.

I'm sticking strictly to my cave these days, turning up the ogg powered 
150 stream icecast madness only when I feel like it.  I guess it's no 
way to live, but hell, I'm a lazy SOB.

Xenophobilcally Yours,

AI

It's two different crowds, who want two different things.  The overlap
is almost zero, unless it's a wedding for ravers.

zacharias moussaui - 20th hi-jacker of 9/11. a moroccan (north africa).
not arab. not afghan. meaning that if bin laden had given him a command,
he would not be able to understand it.  his public statements mocked
the families of the 9/11 victims and were often anti-semitic.  he hated
corporate america much like the black gangster rappers who did the
song '5 million ways to kill a CEO' and showed a picture of the WTC
getting blown up right before 9/11.  the band, the coup, is a san
francisco based black gangster hip hop group.  he had stronger ties
to black gangs than bin laden.

john muhammed & malvo - former gulf war vet trained malvo to take out
a handful of innocent civilians on the east coast.  muhammed, who is black
not arab explained the sarin gas effected his brain during the first gulf war.
sarin gas as well as the initial WMD's were sold to Saddam by Germany.
malvo confessed he was told what to do to incite martial law and to give
the military supreme command.

anonymous white woman - drove her car into the venue at which bush was
giving a speech in philadelphia.  she was high on marijuana.  she was
detained and questioned.  she didn't reveal much information.  but her
background check showed she was suffering from financial problems. 
but the strain of cannibis was identified as jamaican.  she had been 
brainwashed by blacks to commit the act.

jinx kahlil g robinson - trafficked that particular strain of jamaican 
cannibis, 
was the central figure behind the 420 riots in columbus, ohio, which caused 
a million dollars property damage for the city of columbus.  got 240,000 OSU
students to drop out over a 6 year period due to illegal drugs.  got smart
busted for under-age drinking. got metropolis busted for illegal drugs. got
red zone busted for violent gang activity.  history of gang activity with the
folk gang in cleveland (an off shoot of the bloods) including: illegal drug
trafficking, breaking into cars, stealing car stereos, stealing the car, etc.
helped fund 9/11 through illegal drugs with a black gang network associated
with zacharias moussaui.  jinx's mother was a black panther, a gang that
had planned on blowing up building in new york since the 60's as revenge
for the massacre of the initial black panther gang members.  he was also 
a part of the black gang network that falesy accused 12 races (japanese,
koreans, vietnamese, cambodians, phillipenes, chinese, hmongs, arabs,
jews, mexicans, italians, cubans) of innocent people of black gang member 
sins causing 2.2 million lay offs in america.  24.8 million lay offs around 
the
world.  he was able to financially destroy more people than hitler did in a
shorter amount of time.  in intelligence circles he is known as 'the jinx 
bomb'.
but for the FBI he is listed as 'al quida'.

favor nathaniel ryland davis posted a vulgar anti-bush sign in his front yard 
in
columbus, ohio. grew opium in his backyard.  and vocally threatened bush 
and the US senate with chemical warfare.  later on the US senate was attacked 
with ricin that was sent through the mail.  truck drivers were framed for it. 
 but 
it was obvious it was not truckers, because truckers can not obtain ricin.  
investigation showed that favor had obtained his opium seeds from the jinx 
black gangster network and was using it to frame asians, specifically the
ones involved in investigating the 420 riots.

powell used a forged document alleging that saddam had acquired depleted 
uranium from niger meaning what?...the document was the lie...and where did 
that document come from?...NIGER!...one must be associated with NIGER to 
even obtain legal documents from NIGER to forge said documents.

in addition, anyone who has done international investigations
specifically in scams, will tell you that NIGER is a hot bed for 
scam artists...one of the biggest scams was a Niger woman
writing letters to people of wealth claiming that her husband
was killed and she needed to transfer her funds out of africa.
however, once she was given access to a bank account she
withdrew money from it instead of depositing money in it.

africa is very suspect, especially for the anti-terrorism community
especially since zacharias moussaui is from morocca, which is
north africa...and mohammed atta is from egypt, which is also
north africa...africa had been scamming america for years,
asking america for funding, only to find out later that it was
used to fund rebels to overthrow african governments...the
worst case scenario was somalia (what Black Hawk Down was
about), the rebels had gotten so bad that US Forces were called
in...but the US Troops under-estimated the african rebels and
were slaughtered...some troops were dragged in the streets.

this style of dragging victims in the streets was repeated in
an attack in saudi arabia...meaning that it was most likely 
african rebels behind that attack...this was most likely why
arabs massacred the sudanese in africa as revenge for that
attack.

the spain train bombing that killed hundreds of people turned out 
was commited by terrorists from moracco, north africa again.

france was hit by anti-semitic terrorist attacks by apparently black 
nazi gangs targeting upper end jews and jewish temples with 
swastika graffiti. it almost appears that african gangs were 
trying to frame germans for terrorism there.
   
more recent homeland terrorism investigation reports:

black cop in florida was detained for vocally saying that he wanted to 
shoot bush in the head.

black woman got as far as texas with a fake south african passport 
with a gun and $8000 in cash on a mission to assasinate bush.

akbar was the name of the black soldier in iraq that decided to throw a
grenade in his own troop's tent.

one video showing a hostage decapitated allegedly in iraq, turned out to 
be a hoax by a banker from san francisco.

more recent videos show hostage takers wearing american tennis shoes
(afghans do not wear american tennis shoes) others wearing nike ski caps
(afghans do not wear nike ski caps) and victims wearing abu graib uniforms.  
investigation have shown that some of the hostage takers were former black 
gangster inmates that had joined al quieda.

in california black gangs decieved the mormons by falesly accusing mexicans 
of black gang member sins...as a result, mexican ghetto houses were burned 
to the ground and entire mexican farm fields were burned resulting in 2 
billion 
dollars in property damage last year and 1.5 billion dollars in property 
damage 
this year...former black gang members spread malicious propaganda falsely 
accusing 12 races of innocent people black gang member sins as well as 
demonizing children...the decepive propaganda had gotten so bad that at one 
point nine children were killed in the wesson household after being 
brainwashed 
by some of the deceptive propaganda.

<<live in Houston where the homos started this mess.  The police 
got an 'anonymous' call about a burglary in progress.  the 911 call 
was FROM THE HOUSE OF RUMP RANGERS!!!  it was freaking 
staged.

So tell me great and wise koolaid drinker.  where would the native 
americans be TODAY if it weren't for the invasion of the western 
hemisphere?  let me give you some help here.  if you were to take 
a native american from TODAY and say hey, you can go back to the 
way it was, i bet ya anything he'd say, thanks white man, but i'll keep 
my whisky and casinos. you can skin buffalo.

I like your kind though.  Always judging yesterday by today's standards.  
Makes it easy to find someone to argue with.>>

look, i never asked about your beers, steers, and queers problem.

but you have a very good point, the use of hollywood dramatized 
events to demonize poor people has been ridiculous, which also
resulted in the burning of some poor trailer park people here in 
california.

but let me break it to ya into economic terms...
* the nation is approximately $500 billion dollars in the hole.
* the state of california is $15 billion dollars in the hole (arnold
  used bonds as a temporary solution, but those bonds will have
  to be paid back, they're just paid in increments). 
* $70 billion of that $15 billion dollar state defecit was caused by
  greedy energy companies mostly based in texas.
  that isn't even the issue i am upset over, because honestly i
  feel horrible about all the families that got laid off after the 
  enron bust (let the record show i was for compensation and
  not ruining the entire company).
* indian gaming casinos are billions of dollars in the plus, in the
  case of the state of nevada, they don't even have to pay 
  state taxes there anymore, because the cut from casino profits
  covers it all.
* indian gaming casinos who are willing to contribute a portion of
  their profits to state and local taxes are getting killed out here
  even before they can get off the ground, because some ultra
  conservatives feel that casinos would bring a bad crowd to their
  community.
* anybody, who has been to vegas will tell you that vegas is about
  as upper end as beverly hills in their housing, their restaurants, and
  of course their entertainment centers.
* bottom line the indians invoved in gaming are living quite handsomely,
  and they are offering a solution for the california and local city
  government defecit problems, but some idiotic ultra-conservatives
  are killing it even before it can get off the ground.
* keep in mind these are the same idiot ultra-conservatives that wanted
  to kill the further development of wal-mart, which not only provides
  enormous state and local tax money, but much needed jobs.

Subject: {pb-cle} the bush crime family tree

The Bush Crime Family Tree

George Walker, GW's great-grandfather, set up the takeover of the 
Hamburg-America Line, a cover for I.G. Farben's Nazi espionage unit in the 
United States. In Germany, I.G. Farben was most famous for putting the gas 
in gas chambers; it was the producer of Zyklon B and other gasses used on 
victims of the Holocaust. The Bush family was not unaware of the nature of 
their investment partners. They hired Allen Dulles, the future head of the 
CIA, to hide the funds they were making from Nazi investments and the funds 
they were sending to Nazi Germany, rather than divest. It was only in 1942, 
when the government seized Union Banking Company assets under the Trading 
With The Enemy Act, that George Walker and Prescott Bush stopped pumping 
money into Hitler's regime. (1)






Prescott Bush, the president's grandfather. According to classified 
documents from Dutch intelligence and US government archives, President 
George W. Bush's grandfather, Prescott Bush made considerable profits off 
Auschwitz slave labor. In fact, President Bush himself is an heir to these 
profits from the holocaust which were placed in a blind trust in 1980 by his 
father, former president George Herbert Walker Bush. (2) On the 20th of 
October, the government commenced action against the company under the 
trading with the enemy act. (3) After the seizures in late 1942 of five U.S. 
enterprises he managed on behalf of Nazi industrialist Fritz Thyssen failed 
to divest himself of more than a dozen "enemy national" relationships that 
continued until as late as 1951, newly-discovered U.S. government documents 
reveal. (4) In 1952, Prescott Bush was elected to the U.S. Senate, with no 
press accounts about his well-concealed Nazi past.(5)





George Herbert Walker Bush, the presidents father. Bush, as director of the 
CIA, had funneled enormous amounts of cash to drug runners including Manuel 
Noriega and helped in the destabilization of Argentina. Bush utilized his 
own connections to help fund drug runners from Laos to Panama. Most shocking 
was the so-called "cocaine coup" in Bolivia in June 1980, masterminded by 
fugitive Nazi Klaus Barbie, "The Butcher Of Lyons." Barbie, who had been 
previously secreted in Latin America by the CIA, began working closely with 
the Argentines and used drug money to finance a neo-Nazi cabal, one that 
succeeded in overthrowing the government. The troops swept through the 
capital wearing Nazi armbands, according to former DEA agent Mike Levine. 
George H.W. Bush later facilitated the Iran-contra affair, employing many of 
the same methods: secretly selling Central American cocaine in America and 
weapons to Iran while using the profits to fund the contras and to overthrow 
democratically elected socialists in Central America.(6) as the head of the 
CIA and later as Vice President, toppled democratically elected regimes in 
South and Central America and began propping up a dictator by the name of 
Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Although forbidden by congress to do so, he 
continued to sell chemical and biological weapons to Saddam even after he 
used them on villages of innocent civilians. A decade later The United 
States had to go to war against him and the Bush family again, made millions 
from it.


Jonathan J. Bush, the Presidents uncle. Jonathan Bush's "Pioneer Profile" in 
"George W. Bush's $100,000 Club" cites him as the "head" of the Riggs 
Investment Management Co.; "Bushs uncle Jonathan ... founded its 
subsidiary, J. Bush & Co., of which he is chair. He also is an ex-chair of 
the New York Republican State Finance Committee. Bush credits the investors 
sent his way by this banker uncle as a key to his 'success' in the Texas oil 
industry in the early 80s." (17)

Jonathan J. Bush, is a top executive at Riggs Bank, which this week agreed 
to pay a record $25 million in civil fines for violations of law intended to 
thwart money laundering. Jonathan Bush, who is a major fundraiser for his 
nephew, was appointed in 2000 to run Riggs Investment Management Co. His 
association with Riggs began when he headed J. Bush & Co., a New Haven, 
Conn., company he created in 1970 and built to offer advice on money 
management. (18)


According to the 5/14/04 New York Times, Federal regulators fined the Riggs 
National Corporation, the parent company of Riggs Bank, $25 million 
yesterday for "failing to report suspicious activity, the largest penalty 
ever assessed against a domestic bank in connection with money laundering. 
The fine stems from Riggs's failure over at least the last two years to 
actively monitor suspect financial transfers through Saudi Arabian accounts 
held by the bank." The 5/14/04 Wall Street Journal reported that of 
particular concern, Riggs failed to monitor "tens of millions of dollars in 
cash withdrawals from accounts related to the Saudi Arabian embassy," 
including "suspicious incidents involving dozens of sequentially numbered 
cashier's checks and international drafts written by Saudi officials, 
including Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar bin Sultan." According to the 
4/18/04 Washington Post, Saudi Prince Bandar's wife, Princess Haifa 
al-Faisal, "may have used a Riggs account to donate money to a charity that 
then gave some of it to the Sept. 11 terrorists."
(...)
According to the nonprofit Texans for Public Justice, Jonathan Bush is the 
President and CEO of Riggs Investment Management - a major arm of Riggs 
Bank. He is also the uncle of President George W. Bush. The President 
"credits the investors sent his way by this banker uncle as a key to his 
'success' in the Texas oil industry in the early '80s." According to Public 
Citizen, the uncle Jonathan was a Bush Pioneer, having raised more than 
$100,000 for his nephew in 2000.(19)




Neil Bush, the president's brother. Central player of the 1980'ssavings and 
loan scandal, he ran a savings and loan into the ground while shoveling 
millions of its taxpayer-backed dollars into the pockets of two deadbeat 
partners. Neil served as a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan 
in Denver, Colorado, from 1985 until 1988. During that time, the now-dead 
thrift made over $200 million in loans to Neil's two partners in JNB 
Exploration, Neil's abysmally unsuccessful oil company. Federal regulators 
determined that, while Silverado was pumping loans to Neil's two associates, 
Neil was completely dependent on the two men for his income. The failure of 
Silverado -- its closure delayed until after the 1988 election -- cost 
taxpayers about $1 billion. After Silverado failed, Neil started a new oil 
company, Apex Energy. This time, his money came from a $2.35 million loan 
through a Small Business Administration program. When news of this reached 
the press in March 1991, the SBA discovered that the companies through which 
the loan was approved were technically insolvent, and it gave them up to 
thirty months to "self-liquidate." This meant that Apex would have to repay 
its SBA-guaranteed loans. Neil took this as his cue to move on, and he left 
Apex -- and its debts -- for others to worry about. (7) update: Neil Bush 
made $171,370 in one day. The fact that he was a former consultant to the 
company whose stock he dumped is just a coincidence




Marvin Bush, the president's brother was on the board of directors of a 
company providing electronic security for the World Trade Center, Dulles 
International Airport and United Airlines, according to public records. The 
company was backed by an investment firm, the Kuwait-American Corp., also 
linked for years to the Bush family. The security company, formerly named 
Securacom and now named Stratesec, is in Sterling, Va.. Its CEO, Barry 
McDaniel, said the company had a ``completion contract" to handle some of 
the security at the World Trade Center ``up to the day the buildings fell 
down." The suite in which Marvin Bush was annually re-elected, according to 
public records, is located in the Watergate in space leased to the Saudi 
government. The company now holds shareholder meetings in space leased by 
the Kuwaiti government there.(8) (9) more




Jeb Bush, the president's brother. After graduating from Texas University, 
Jeb Bush served a short apprenticeship at the Venezuelan branch of Texas 
Commerce Bank in Caracas before settling in Miami, in 1980, to work on his 
father's unsuccessful primary bid against Ronald Reagan. Shortly after 
arriving in Miami, Jeb was hired by Cuban-American developer Armando Codina 
to work at his Miami development company as an agent leasing office space. A 
couple of years later, Jeb and Codina became business partners, and in 1985 
they purchased an office building in a deal partly financed by a savings and 
loan that later failed.The $4.56 million loan, from Broward Federal Savings 
in Sunrise, Florida, was granted in such a way that neither Codina's nor 
Bush's name appeared on the loan papers as the borrowers. A third man, J. 
Edward Houston, borrowed the $4.56 million from Broward and then re-lent it 
to the Bush partnership. When federal regulators closed Broward Savings in 
1988, they found the loan, which had been secured by the Bush partnership, 
in default. As Jeb's father was finishing his second term as vice-president 
and running for the presidency, federal regulators had two options: to get 
Jeb Bush and his partner to repay the loan, or to foreclose on their office 
building. But regulators came up with a third solution. After reappraising 
the building, regulators decided it wasn't worth as much as was owed for it. 
The regulators reduced the amount owed by Bush and his partner from $4.56 
million to just $500,000. The pair paid that amount and were allowed to keep 
their office building. Taxpayers picked up the tab for the unpaid $4 
million. (10)

 He also rigged an election that you may have heard about. Thousands of 
eligible voters were disallowed the right to vote in predominantly 
democratic regions. Between May 1999 and Election Day 2000, two Florida 
secretaries of state - Sandra Mortham and Katherine Harris, both protges 
of Governor Jeb Bush- ordered 57,700 "ex-felons," who are prohibited from 
voting by state law, to be removed from voter rolls. (In the thirty-five 
states where former felons can vote, roughly 90 percent vote Democratic.) A 
company now owned by ChoicePoint of Atlanta, was paid $4.3 million for its 
work, replacing a firm that charged $5,700 per year for the same service.Two 
of these "scrub lists," as officials called them, were distributed to 
counties in the months before the election with orders to remove the voters 
named. Together the lists comprised nearly 1 percent of Florida?s electorate 
and nearly 3 percent of its African-American voters. Neither DBT nor the 
state conducted any further research to verify the matches. DBT, which 
frequently is hired by the F.B.I. to conduct manhunts, originally proposed 
using address histories and financial records to confirm the names, but the 
state declined the cross-checks. (11)




George W. Bush, second appointed president of the United States.

 1979-83: Fifty Bush family investors and friends, led by uncle Jonathan, a 
New York Republican Party official and an investment manager, fork over $4.7 
million to set up young Bush in a company called Arbusto. It's a flop, and 
in 1982 gets a new name: Bush Exploration.


 1984: Spectrum 7 Corporation, an Ohio oil exploration outfit owned by 
Dubya's Yalie pal William DeWitt Jr., buys out Bush Exploration, setting up 
young Bush as CEO at $75,000 a year and giving him 1.1 million shares of the 
firm's stock. Another flop. The company's fortunes soon sink, with $400,000 
in losses and a debt of $3 million.


 1986: In the nick of time, Bush and partners merge the failing Spectrum 
with Harken Oil, a Dallas exploration company, with a $2 million stock 
purchase. Bush puts up about $500,000 and gets a $120,000 annual consulting 
fee along with $131,250 in stock options. Harken is a small outfit, looking 
for oil opportunities within the U.S. Then out of the blue comes Harvard 
Management Corporation, an investment adviser for Harvard University's 
endowment portfolio. It pumps millions into the venture.


 1990: Although Harken has no international expertise, it gets the 
attention of the Bahrain National Oil Company, which unexpectedly appears on 
the scene and bypasses big oil's Amoco and Chevron to sign a production 
agreement with the little Texas concern. The contract grants Harken 
exclusive rights to what seems to be a promising offshore area squeezed 
between two productive tracts owned by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The Wall 
Street Journal speculates Bahrain was trying to cozy up to Daddy Bush, who 
was plotting an assault on Iraq after Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait.


Bass Enterprises Production Company finances the Bahrain drilling with $25 
million, and Harvard Management raises its investment. A couple of members 
of the Fort Worth Bass family have places on Team 100, an elite business 
group contributing to the Republican National Committee.


In June, Harken drills two dry holes in Bahrain. The future looks bleak. 
Dubya dumps two-thirds of his Harken holdings (212,140 shares), for 
$848,560. He uses some of this money to buy into the Texas Rangers baseball 
club. This is a lot of stock to dump on the market all at once, and brokers 
say it was purchased by an unnamed institutional investor.


That August, Harken posts a loss of $23 million.


 January 1991: Daddy Bush attacks Iraq.


 February 1991: Dubya, as the official in charge at Harken, reports his big 
stock sale to the SECeight months late.


 April 1991: The SEC begins an investigation into Harken dealings. Chairman 
Richard Breeden, who had been appointed by the senior Bush and served him as 
an economic policy adviser, hails from Baker & Botts, a big Texas oil law 
firm where he was a partner. Inside the SEC, James Doty, general counsel and 
the official in charge of any litigation that might come out of the Harken 
investigation, is another alumnus of Baker & Botts. And as a private 
attorney, before joining the government, Doty represented the younger Bush 
in matters related to Dubya's ownership of the Rangers.


 1993: The SEC ends its Harken investigation following perfunctory 
interviews.


The good people of Baker & Botts continued looking out for Shrub. Since 
1993, Breeden, Doty, and other lawyers there have given him $182,050 for his 
various political campaigns, making the firm one of his biggest 
supporters.(12)

Upon appointment as president, Bush appoints 6 Iran-contra defendants to 
his staff, (13) fills the upper levels of the White house and pentagon with 
senior members of the PNAC (14) including his speech writer, chief advisor, 
secretary of defense, and vice president. Uses the terrorist attacks of 9-11 
(16) to illegally invade and occupy Iraq under the false pretense of 
imminent threat (15) and reaps billions for Cheney's Halliburton, Rumsfeld's 
Bechtel, and his own family's Carlyle group.



newsweek article on Bush/Nazi connection  

Bush - Nazi Dealings Continued Until 1951 - Federal Documents 

Karl Rove's grandfather was Karl Heinz Roverer, the Gauleiter of Oldenburg. 
Roverer was Reich-Statthalter---Nazi State Party Chairman---for his region. 
He was also a partner and senior engineer in the Roverer Sud-Deutche 
Ingenieurburo A. G. engineering firm, which built the Birkenau death camp, 

Still, that's ancient history. Surely bush wouldn't be repeating the actions 
of fascist dictators. Or would he?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dubtribe in Chicago

my beef was that they act all hippy-ass and free-loving and about the music, and that's a total front. I quote from dubtribe.com:

"Dubtribe have spearheaded the North American movement to unite people of all colors, all backgrounds, and all lifestyles to dance, celebrate life, and viciously assault the status quo, sling rocks into the face of capitalism, greed, fear and selfishness."<comment> but only if you pay us for it</comment>

it's just flat out hypocritical. You're either about the music, or about the money. I don't particularly care which side anybody falls, as long as it's good music. But when you start saying you're one way, then acting a totally different way... i take issue with that.

Subject: {pb-cle} this Friday! LP & PETER LEE at Muse!


Digitalgoodtime LLC is proud to present Fridays @ Muse

this is a FREE weekly event

The DJ's kickin off a new month for us are:

LP (Pittsburgh) - One of the very few DJ's that I can honestly say has a 
trademark sound. His industrial/rock/80's influenced electro house and 
breakbeat took Muse by storm during his last performance, if you missed out, 
make sure you don't miss it again.

Peterlee (Digitalgoodtime) - Bringing us a little bit of everything, expect 
to hear breaks, house, and hip hop from one of the most versatile Dj's in 
the city. Don't miss it.

RESIDENT DJ'S in weekly rotation:
Philo
Aaron Clark

$2 Yuengling bottles all night

Come support the underground with Digitalgoodtime @ MUSE this and every 
friday.

MUSE is located @ 228 S Highland Ave
across from casbah restaurant and behind shadyside Tan. See everyone there

Subject: {pb-cle} SRR: Foam Machine to rent

I know its getting a bit cold out now but if anyone is intrested I now have 
an industrial size foam machine / snow machine for rent.  It is capable of 
filling an area 24x24x6 in about 20 minutes.  I'm down to rent this thing 
out pretty cheap,  I know a few other people in Cleve try to charge 
ridiculous prices for something that makes soap suds.

That is what came to my mind.  Having an implant is not far off from =
having a barcode tatooed to you (as was the suggestion).  It is REALLY =
scarey stuff.   To think taht you could get tagged by the government at =
any time.  To think that the patriot act? made it so you COULD be given =
the mark of the beast.

I read a book about that back in the early 80's.

My feeling on this is, it's cool and in a perfect world would be great 
if everyone had it, but we're not in a perfect world, so I wouldn't do 
it.  One thing I would like to see is a small device you can use to 
activate and deactivate it so it won't respond to any requests for an 
id.  For the vip club example, the chip is active while you're at the 
club.  When you leave you pass this little device over the chip and it 
deactivates it so any requests for an id won't get a response until you 
activate it again.  Would be a little better at stopping the 'big 
brother' concern.  although who's to say the government has a way to 
see the chip even when deactivated.  Which means you would need some 
sort of physical access to the chip to deactivate it, which I couldn't 
see from how it looks right now.

If I get a tattoo, I want to get one of a barcode :)  It wouldn't be 
anything 'real' like a SS# or anything.  Maybe a birthdate or 
something.  Tattooed right on my neck :)  But since I'm not getting a 
tattoo anytime in the forseeable future, don't have to worry about 
that.

Any similarity to how a Russian prison tattoo could sentence a person to

Subject: {pb-cle} Nrr: *** Urgent Action Needed*** HEA Reformation (Ohio & PA residents)

Please take a brief moment to look this over.... Maybe you could make a 
difference.
-Trish


The following is an alert from our friends at The Coalition for Higher 
Education Act Reform, a coalition of groups including NORML that is working 
to repeal the High Education Act Drug Provision which denies federal 
financial aid to any student with a drug conviction.

The Higher Education Act Drug Provision denies college financial aid to 
persons with drug convictions, no matter how minor. In the next couple of 
weeks, the Senate Judiciary Committee may vote on a bill that would reform 
or repeal this harmful law.

S. 1860 would reauthorize of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy and section 1002 of the bill would revise the Higher Education Act 
Drug Provision so that only those students who committed their drug offense 
while receiving financial aid would lose their aid. While this revision is 
welcome, thousands of low- and middle-income students will continue to be
denied a college education because of minor drug offenses. We are urging 
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to introduce an amendment to the 
bill that would fully repeal the HEA Drug Provision.


URGENT ACTION NEEDED

If one of your Senators is on the the Judiciary Committee, please email, 
fax, or call them today urging them to introduce an amendment to S.1860 to 
fully repeal the Higher Education Act Drug Provision. If your organization 
is from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Delaware, or California, it is especially
important that you call your Senator. Talking points are below.

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee include:

Ohio: Mike DeWine (R-OH) -- ph: (202) 224-2315; fx: (202) 224-6519;
http://dewine.senate.gov

Pennsylvania:
Arlen Specter (R-PA) -- ph: (202) 224-4254; fx: (202) 228-1229; 
arlen_specter@specter.senate.gov


WHAT TO SAY OR WRITE:


Hi, my name is __________ and I'm from  __<city>__.  Within the next couple 
of weeks, Senator ______ could vote on S. 1860, the reauthorization of the 
Office of National Drug Control Policy, in the Judiciary Comittee.
I'm calling to ask Senator __________ to introduce an amendment to S. 1860 
that would repeal the ban on federal financial aid for drug offenders.

This provision is poorly-designed and causes enormous harm.

<INSERT ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TALKING POINTS>:

The ban only affects students from low- and middle-income families who 
depend on aid to afford college.  Students from wealthier backgrounds who 
can afford to pay the full cost of college tuition are unaffected by the 
drug provision.

 The ban punishes students twice for the same crime.  Students have already 
paid whatever price the criminal justice system demands of them. The 
provision represents an additional punishment that limits a student's 
ability to get an education.

The ban has a discriminatory impact on minorities.  For  example, 
African-Americans, who comprise 13% of the population and 13% of all drug 
users, account for more than half of those convicted of drug possession 
charges.

 The ban will not solve our nation's drug problem.  To limit the number of 
deserving students eligible for federal financial aid is counter-productive. 
  Access to a college education is the surest route to the mainstream 
economy and a crime-free life.

I hope that Senator ________ will work to repeal this damaging, 
discriminatory law.  Thank you.

i'm not sure where else these are being used.  it struck me as funny that
they'd experiment on the 'big clubbin' crowd - probably a lot more apt to
go with the flow than say a group of office workers offered the chip for
cafeteria food.

"VeriChip - there when you need it"

looks like this company - http://www.adsx.com

owns this - http://www.digitalangelcorp.com

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  So far all but one person thinks this is a good
idea, so I'm leaving them in.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri. October 15 @ The Eye - ages 18 , 7pm

DigitalGoodtime.com, Brighton Music Center and Shure proudly present:

SHORTKUT of the World Famous Beat Junkies![/color]

That's right y'all, SHORTKUT is coming to Pittsburgh. Shortkut will be 
performing a FREE 20 minute demo at Brighton Music Center on Babcock 
Boulevard, showing aspiring turntablists scratch techniques and possibly 
also demo-ing the Rane Serato Scratch machine, Rane's answer to 
Stanton's Final Scratch. This will be followed by autographs, giveaways 
and raffles (featuring the needles described later). Then in the 
evening, SHORTKUT will be performing a full-length set at THE EYE on 
Penn Avenue and the raffle winners will be announced. Only those 
attending Brighton's demo will be given raffle tickets for the needles, 
but all get the free goodies. Winners of the raffle will be announced @ 
The Eye later that night, and only those at The Eye are eligible to win. 
In short, you gotta be at both performances to win these needles, but 
they're well well worth it...

Giveaways at Brighton from Shure will include a raffle for a pair of 
M447 scratch needles (the industry benchmark and praised for their 
quality; endorsed by the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Beat Junkies, 
X-Ecutioners, DJ Craze and more), t-shirts, stickers and more. In 
addition, we have swag from Odyssey, Rane, Brighton Music Center, 
Digital Goodtime, LLC and more...

More info to be posted as it becomes confirmed, so check back!

from Beatjunkies.com:

Shortkut began his DJ career is 1987 with Just 2 Hype!, a DJ crew based 
out of Daly City, California. In 1994, Shortkut, together with QBert and 
MixMaster Mike, formed the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, a legendary turntable 
band that heralded a new era in the DJ/turntablist world, and helped 
raise this musical art to its new form. Later that same year, J.Rocc, 
the "Funky President" of the Beat Junkies, invited Shortkut to join 
their internationally acclaimed collective, based out of Los Angeles. 
Shortkut's addition to this musical group has diversified the Beat 
Junkie audience to new realms....

about Tim Skinner:
While Tim Skinner has been an established figure in Florida's dance 
scene since the early 90's, 2002 was the year he showed the rest of the 
world his true abilities by filling in for Jimmy Van M as he took on 
opening duties for the Delta Heavy - a 40-city tour across North America 
featuring Sasha & John Digweed.

Later that year, Tim toured with John Digweed on Moby's Area 2 Tour 
featuring David Bowie and again demonstrated his talent to fans in 14 
cities throughout North America. Since then, Tims travels have 
regularly taken him beyond the borders to locales such as Central and 
South America where he has built quite a loyal following.

When not traveling, Tim can be found working diligently in the studio. 
He and Barry Robb (aka Sphere) founded Grounded Music, which features a 
number of his studio productions. Other production work and remixes from 
Tim can be found on leading record labels throughout the globe. Most 
recently, Tim partnered with Martin Accorsi to produce an EP slated for 
an end of summer release on John Digweeds Bedrock Records. To follow 
Tims continued presence in dance music, visit:

What's pretty scary to me about this is that an identity-related

HEADLINE: Digimarc Signs Agreement with National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration for Pilot to Enhance Driver License Security 
with Digital Watermarking

DATELINE: BEAVERTON, Ore. Sept. 30, 2004

BODY:

The cooperative agreement will fund pilot to authenticate 
digitally watermarked driver licenses at points of inspection and 
to enhance ID security

Digimarc Corporation (Nasdaq:DMRC) today announced it has signed 
an agreement with the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation 
(DOT), for a pilot program that will enable law enforcement, 
retailers and Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVs) to inspect and 
authenticate driver licenses secured with covert digital 
watermarking-based security features. The program, valued at 
approximately $1 million, will begin immediately and is expected 
to be completed late in 2005.

One of the applications of the new technology to be tested is 
enhanced age verification. Police estimate many millions of fake 
driver licenses are in circulation nationwide and suggest that 
half of all high school students today may carry some sort of 
forged ID. The Journal of Studies of Alcohol reports that young 
drivers within certain blood alcohol level ranges are far more 
likely to be killed in single vehicle crashes than sober young 
drivers. It is also well known that people who have been denied 
licenses or had them revoked often rely on counterfeit licenses, 
posing another significant risk to traffic safety.

Because of the link between fake driver licenses and highway 
safety, the DOT-funded program -- called the "Operational Pilot of 
Digital Watermarking Reading for Driver License Authentication and 
Traffic Enforcement Support" -- aims to improve traffic safety and 
ID security by validating the cross-jurisdictional inspection and 
authentication capabilities of digitally-watermarked driver 
licenses.

Under the pilot, Digimarc will create a request for proposals 
inviting state DMVs to apply to participate in the pilot and help 
drive the requirements for testing operational aspects of 
inspecting digitally watermarked driver licenses in the field. 
Today, 10 states representing more than 20 percent of all yearly 
driver licenses issued in the U.S. have incorporated digital 
watermarking as an innovative, new layer of driver license 
security.

"In the battle against identity theft and fraud, digital 
watermarking adds a unique, new layer of machine-readable 
protection and authentication to the state-issued driver license, 
helping thwart would-be counterfeiters within and across state 
lines, "said J. Scott Carr, president, Digimarc Watermarking 
Solutions. "We applaud the Department of Transportation's 
leadership role in addressing these important safety issues. In 
the end, we believe this pilot and related efforts will 
substantially improve the safety of citizens and law enforcement 
on our roads and highways, while respecting citizens' privacy and 
supporting state efforts to issue secure identity credentials."

Digital watermarking provides a covert, machine-readable layer of 
security that offers DMVs and other issuers of secure IDs a 
powerful, new weapon in the fight against digital counterfeiting, 
identity theft, fraud and related activities such as underage 
drinking and driving. These new security features also have 
national security implications as they can be used to address many 
of the ID-related Homeland Security issues highlighted by the 9/11 
Commission Report.

Law enforcement, DMV branch offices and retail environments with 
age-restricted products such as alcohol and tobacco are expected 
to test the fraud-reducing capabilities of digital watermarking 
during the pilot program.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} related to the arm chip...

I don't like the "retailer" part of that.  I don't want my license 
being swiped by retailers so they can sell my address to spammers (no 
tinfoil story, i've heard from people that actually work at restaurants 
that do that)  In fact, the magnetic stripe on my card doesn't work for 
some reason.  But I didn't do it on purpose.  Although I know a few 
people that have.  Still doesn't stop them from just entering the 
number in there, but at least it's a little better since I don't know 
what's stored on the stripe.  I have a card reader and I tried to find 
it and was annoyed by not being able to see it (because it was wiped 
out).
