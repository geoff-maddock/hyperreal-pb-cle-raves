Subject: {pb-cle} Beat Matrix | 03.01.2003 | wruw fm 91.1

Hey PB-Cle'ers,
  This week's installment of the Beat Matrix will feature a phone interview
interview with the man of mystery Ishkur, author of Ishkur's Guide to
Electronic music (http://www.ishkur.com/features/music/index.htm).  For
ya'll that don't know, Ishkur's put together a comprehensive guide to the
evolution of electronic music over the past 20 years.  He's got samples
from every single genre thinkable (and unthinkable).  For ya'll that know,
you can't help but laugh at some of his descriptions of these genres
(Goth, and Jpop are a couple of my faves).  I definitely can't wait to
hear what he has to say. Tune in to the first half hour of the show and
you'll get to hear what this guy is all about.

Tentatively a DJ From the Euphorix crew will be playing live in the studio
from 11p-12.  If not, Jassen will be be providing the mix.  Either way,
the show's gonna be slammin'.

Trout's set list has been posted at www.beatmatrix.net.  Be sure to tune
it at 10:30 sharp to catch the latest releases and the Ishkur interview!

Subject: {pb-cle} Ritual - Diesel Boy Thanks!

One word RAW.

That is the best time I have had in 4 years. Thank you to who ever put this
on.

The dj that came on before diesel boy was dropping some Hard House/NRG
tracks right near the end. Who was this dj? Is he local to pb-cle? I didn't
even know you could listen to HH in Cleveland anymore. 

Also I was up stairs and a good portion of what he DB was playing was from
cd. Good to see.

Paul

for anyone that's into honkey-tech i'll be playing
twice this week - wednesday @ electrasoul, and
thursday night @ havana. 

this will be my last gig @ havana before i move at the
end of the summer, so it's meant to be kind of an
early send off party. (i was originally planning to
leave around april) 

i will have some cd's on hand to give away if that
matters. 

havana has always been one of my favorite places to
play, and i'll miss it when i leave...i'll be having a
real good time that night so come join me!  (thanks to
jason c and co. for all the good memories)

"You too could have a pierced colon if you go to the digital

I wonder if that's what they mean by "body piercing?"

is body piercing the "crackno" coming off the three platters when 
colin is playing?   

Will you be playing pounding stuff both nights, or will havana be 
more housey?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Third eye and Dslboy pix

Well, there wasn't any intelligent lighting and the batteries in my flash 
died, so there wasn't much that could be done.

plus, I was having too much fun hanging out with all the people that I 
haven't seen in a while that I almost forgot to take pics!

Wonder if this is the same Roid-head that tossed Skillz out for breakdancing....

You know what they say, folks...fool me once, shame on you.....

George, the Mythodic/Ritual folks are here, somewhere, on the list...I'd suggest sending them a
detailed description of what went down, as they've let Moda management know about incidents like
this in the past. I'm sure they'd like to know about shit like this going on during their events.

First of all respect to ritual for trying to dnb at a big club. Even thought it was a relatively
safe bet with Dsl headlining. And respect for pushing local talent by booking evan evolution.
However that hard house cat was awful. Some seriously horrific mixes in his set, and that air horn
thing has got to go.

Second, fair set by Dsl, not the best I've heard from him, but he did his thing. However his mixing
isn't nearly as exciting as it used to be, and i would guess it would have to do with the fact of
him playing almost exclusively cd's. Playing Cd's you just don't have the option of getting tunes
qued & locked as quickly as with vinyl/dubs. Not too mention the fact of not having the luxury of
seeing breakdown and such to time out mixes better. But he did put forth some nice tunes, and an
overall quality set.

Now as far as moda & the hype, it's def a cool club, nice decor, but the sound wasn't quite as good
as is hyped but still pretty good. (The drink list left much to be desired.)

Now lastly a BIG FUCK YOU TO THE MODA, THE OWNERS OF MODA, AND THE MODA SECURITY STAFF! I don't plan
on ever setting foot inside that club again until some serious changes are made. If I & a group of
friends choose to patronize an establishment such as Moda, and drop a couple hundred on tickets &
drinks for the purpose of entertainment, I DEMAND that we be treated with respect.

Now to the incident. Someone had decided to jump up on one of the speaker stacks and started
dancing, which was apparently a big no-no in the eyes of the security staff. So, instead of politely
asked said dancer to please come down, some fucking meathead security guard picks up a full bottle
of beer (glass) and luanches it at him. Missed him completly and hits my Fiance (Amy) in the side,
soaking her in beer & bruising her hip bone. She walks over to confront the security guy. Who
proceeds to grab her by the wrist, twist her arm and tells her if she doesn't she'll be removed from
the club. FUCK THAT!!! I'm so glad this hapened while I happened to be in the restrooms at the time,
becuase I for sure would have gotten kicked out.

Ever time I turned around the was some meathead security asshole scolding someone, talking down to
them because he's a 250lb grolla with 3000lb ego, and not a 1/2 ounce worth of brains. They should
rename the place Drama.

>>From what I understand, moda's business has gone down considerately ever since it's opening and the
club is usually pretty empty except for headliner nights, No wonder. This is the same stupid shit
that took Trilogy / Metropolis down. Don't you assholes get it? Treat people with repsect, show them
a good time, and you will keep them coming back.

i gotta disagree with u...i find queing cd's much easier than queing
vinyl...and as long as you know your tunes...the visual reference isnt that
important...plus u never have a dustball on the end of a needle with a cd to
fuck with u while u are queing...when dsl played metropolis a few months
back...it was pretty much an all cd set...and it was waaay better than the
set at moda...i personally think the medium used in a set is a
non-issue....the real issue is the tunes being played.

i was told they turned the subs wayyyyy down so they wouldn't blow????
whhhhaaaa????  don't they have compressor/limiters?  or didn't they buy 
speakers enough to handle dance music? or is someone just paranoid.....

i was up on the balcony and just figured the bass wasn't working its way 
up there so i went down on the floor and was sorely disappointed....

all i can say is i had a hell of a time there otherwise.  hopefully 
they'll run the bass the next time they have a jungle dj....
oh, and the breaker circle went without incident    :)

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Ritual - Diesel Boy Thanks!

First off I would like to thank everyone that came out this past sat to =
rock
out with Dieselboy...That guy rocks every time I see him.  Turnout was =
good
and the vibe was definitely the best I have felt since we have been in
there.

Now in reply to some of the negative comments.

Sound:
Damien came in during the afternoon and did sound check and everything =
was
rockin'.  Now mind you this was when there was no one in the building so =
the
bass wasn't absorbed by the ppl so we thought everything was going to be
fine.

The system @ moda does have compressors and limiters and they were =
actually
turned up during sound check.  But what was happening was that when =
Damien
would hit a certain volume level the system would compress slightly but =
when
J Messinian would start talking over the mic it would compress even =
further.

This was a problem the entire night.  Damien was experimenting with it =
the
entire night but felt he would rather have a "cleaner" sound at a lower
volume than distorted sound at the higher volume.  With this being the =
first
dnb show there we definitely have to work out some kinks.  Overall the =
sound
was good just not GREAT.

Now onto the security issues:

I was not aware of the incident with the girl getting hit with a bottle =
and
that whole incident.  I will address that later today with Mgmt.  Over =
the
past few wks since the "skillz" incident the security in the place thus =
far
has been a lot better and a lot more respectful of the clientel.  I am =
sorry
if something else has flared up again and it will be addressed =
immediately.
Once again as all of you know this is work in progress with the mgmt and
security staff.  Over all every one of our parties thus far have been =
very
good with very little drama.  Good vibe.good turout. Good music.=20

Thanks again to everyone that came out on Sat.   Hope to see all of you =
out
again.  If anyone ever wants or needs to contact me for anything please
don't hesitate.  My email is Michael@mythodic.com=20

Cheers.

i was told they turned the subs wayyyyy down so they wouldn't blow????
whhhhaaaa????  don't they have compressor/limiters?  or didn't they buy=20
speakers enough to handle dance music? or is someone just paranoid.....

i was up on the balcony and just figured the bass wasn't working its way =

up there so i went down on the floor and was sorely disappointed....

all i can say is i had a hell of a time there otherwise.  hopefully=20
they'll run the bass the next time they have a jungle dj....
oh, and the breaker circle went without incident    :)

Figured out how to have it not keep sending to the list, I think...

40controlthenight.com&to=USERNAME%40DOMAIN.COM

Change the USERNAME%40DOMAIN.COM to whatever your email address is.  the %40 
is the @ sign.

there was no bass. i was down on the floor next to the bins, my guess is 
they were off.

sounds like the curve was set too hard or something, but to totally 
obliterate the bottom end something is wrong.  vocals should not "duck" 
the volume that bad unless it was intended....
does the bar have a soundman?  or do you just leave it to the dj?

well missing the sub bass on jungle is a major bummer....  honestly i 
was looking forward to the bass there, because that system is supposed 
to be setup to handle it....

this is called a ducker.... you can put a mic into the key input on a 
compressor and have it behave that way, they're perfect for wedding djs, 
radio djs and the like..... i noticed the background music on WRUW doing 
this when they were interviewing me.  of course for an MC, you don't 
want that effect.....  i also saw tik tak scrunching down next to the 
bass bins to see if they were on.

Both nights were a lot of fun. I was really impressed by Soulstice. I
thought they would play a bunch of their older studio tracks but they
didn't, which made both their sets enjoyable.

Subject: {pb-cle} Jeff Samuel/Plate Tec reminder

--0-2126491228-1078189154=:3328
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Here's a reminder...thanks to everyone who has been supporting Plate Tec. events.  (so many of you listees are simply the best!)  Hope the vibe just carries on, and on, and on(er.....bangs on&on).  Can't believe it's already here, but THIS FRIDAY is the next Plate Tectonics.  Dare I do a roll call??
 
FYI again, in case you haven't seen the details (I gotta give Jamie and Damon props on the lineup):
 
Jeff Samuel (poker flat, trapez, lo-fi stereo, 7th city, Karloff/Seattle)
with 
Mike Salamon (On the Floor/Columbus)
Derek Johnson (On the Floor/Columbus)
Damon Havill (Plate Tectonics/Abbasso)

March 5th 
9:00 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.
$6 before 10:00, $8 after

Abbasso is located at 1222 Prospect Road, Cleveland
216-566-7278
more info: http://www.geocities.com/clevetechno/jeffsamuel.html


A Cleveland native, now residing in Seattle, Jeff is the new face of techno, stepping onto the international stage with his unique brand of minimal yet melodic grooves. With artists such as Ricardo Villalobos and Michael Mayer remixing his work and DJ's such as Richie Hawtin, Sven Vaeth, Josh Wink, Timo Maas, and Steve Bug charting his records, it is quite apparent that Jeff is a key player in techno and the subgenres that surround it. 

Drawing from his early experiences with Titonton Duvante and the Columbus "ele mental" collective, Jeff Samuel is also very much at home behind the decks. Its often possible to catch Jeff using some of his unique trick-oriented elements of mixing (Detroit style), which is something he attributes to some of his influential favorites such as Derrick May and Jeff Mills. 

With a full European tour slated for Spring and plans to continue to push his quality sound further  with upcoming releases on Spectral and Morris Audio  Jeff Samuel proves he is one to watch.

I remember Jeff Samuel throwing down the best stuff I heard all night at Rave the Planet years ago.... anyone remember that show? He played in one of the upstairs rooms at the Agora (as did Hesohi)... can't imagine what his set consists of these days! 

 

more info: http://www.geocities.com/clevetechno/jeffsamuel.html


A Cleveland native, now residing in Seattle, Jeff is the new face of techno, stepping onto the international stage with his unique brand of minimal yet melodic grooves. With artists such as Ricardo Villalobos and Michael Mayer remixing his work and DJ's such as Richie Hawtin, Sven Vaeth, Josh Wink, Timo Maas, and Steve Bug charting his records, it is quite apparent that Jeff is a key player in techno and the subgenres that surround it. 

Drawing from his early experiences with Titonton Duvante and the Columbus "ele mental" collective, Jeff Samuel is also very much at home behind the decks. Its often possible to catch Jeff using some of his unique trick-oriented elements of mixing (Detroit style), which is something he attributes to some of his influential favorites such as Derrick May and Jeff Mills. 

With a full European tour slated for Spring and plans to continue to push his quality sound further  with upcoming releases on Spectral and Morris Audio  Jeff Samuel proves he is one to watch.

Here's a reminder...thanks to everyone who has been supporting Plate Tec.
events.  (so many of you listees are simply the best!)  Hope the vibe just
carries on, and on, and on(er.....bangs on&on).  Can't believe it's already
here, but THIS FRIDAY is the next Plate Tectonics.  Dare I do a roll call??

FYI again, in case you haven't seen the details (I gotta give Jamie and
Damon props on the lineup):

Jeff Samuel (poker flat, trapez, lo-fi stereo, 7th city, Karloff/Seattle)
with
Mike Salamon (On the Floor/Columbus)
Derek Johnson (On the Floor/Columbus)
Damon Havill (Plate Tectonics/Abbasso)

March 5th
9:00 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.
$6 before 10:00, $8 after

Abbasso is located at 1222 Prospect Road, Cleveland
216-566-7278
more info: http://www.geocities.com/clevetechno/jeffsamuel.html


A Cleveland native, now residing in Seattle, Jeff is the new face of techno,
stepping onto the international stage with his unique brand of minimal yet
melodic grooves. With artists such as Ricardo Villalobos and Michael Mayer
remixing his work and DJ's such as Richie Hawtin, Sven Vaeth, Josh Wink,
Timo Maas, and Steve Bug charting his records, it is quite apparent that
Jeff is a key player in techno and the subgenres that surround it.

Drawing from his early experiences with Titonton Duvante and the Columbus
"ele mental" collective, Jeff Samuel is also very much at home behind the
decks. It's often possible to catch Jeff using some of his unique
trick-oriented elements of mixing (Detroit style), which is something he
attributes to some of his influential favorites such as Derrick May and Jeff
Mills.

With a full European tour slated for Spring and plans to continue to push
his quality sound further - with upcoming releases on Spectral and Morris
Audio - Jeff Samuel proves he is one to watch.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Ritual - Diesel Boy Thanks!

thats just dumb...its a horrible idea to turn the subs down...cuz thats just 
gonna make the dj drive the mixer even harder to hear/feel what bass is 
there...and anyone who runs a sound system should know that its better to 
run speakers at their rated specs with a distortion free signal...then to 
pump a hugely distorted signal thru at lower wattage...they probably did 
more damage to the highs and mids by turning the subs down...than anything d 
couldve done with the subs turned up...hell if the subs were up he probably 
wouldntve been adding any gain at the eq.

i dont believe nexo would install a system w/o a limiter of some type.


i hope moda gets their act together w/ the sound system if they are gonna 
have dnb there again...like i said...shit should not hit harder in my 
project studio than at a club with a good system.



Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

Looking forward to seeing what he throws down at Abbasso. I've really like all the stuff he's put out lately. VIVA Plate Tectonics!!

Here's a reminder...thanks to everyone who has been supporting Plate Tec. 
events. (so many of you listees are simply the best!) Hope the vibe just 
carries on, and on, and on(er.....bangs on&on). Can't believe it's already here, 
but THIS FRIDAY is the next Plate Tectonics. Dare I do a roll call??

FYI again, in case you haven't seen the details (I gotta give Jamie and Damon 
props on the lineup):

Jeff Samuel (poker flat, trapez, lo-fi stereo, 7th city, Karloff/Seattle)
with 
Mike Salamon (On the Floor/Columbus)
Derek Johnson (On the Floor/Columbus)
Damon Havill (Plate Tectonics/Abbasso)

March 5th 
9:00 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.
$6 before 10:00, $8 after

Abbasso is located at 1222 Prospect Road, Cleveland
216-566-7278
more info: http://www.geocities.com/clevetechno/jeffsamuel.html


A Cleveland native, now residing in Seattle, Jeff is the new face of techno, 
stepping onto the international stage with his unique brand of minimal yet 
melodic grooves. With artists such as Ricardo Villalobos and Michael Mayer 
remixing his work and DJ's such as Richie Hawtin, Sven Vaeth, Josh Wink, Timo Maas, 
and Steve Bug charting his records, it is quite apparent that Jeff is a key 
player in techno and the subgenres that surround it. 

Drawing from his early experiences with Titonton Duvante and the Columbus 
"ele mental" collective, Jeff Samuel is also very much at home behind the decks. 
Its often possible to catch Jeff using some of his unique trick-oriented 
elements of mixing (Detroit style), which is something he attributes to some of 
his influential favorites such as Derrick May and Jeff Mills. 

With a full European tour slated for Spring and plans to continue to push his 
quality sound further  with upcoming releases on Spectral and Morris Audio 
Jeff Samuel proves he is one to watch.

Yup, I've been looking forward to this one for a couple of months.  Based on 
what I've heard about his recent live sets, I fully expect Jeff to tear the 
place apart on Friday.

Let's hope he gives us a preview of some unreleased stuff too.  Mmmmmmm.

Someone suggested sueing, but,
Yo honestly.. Send a letter to them @ moda describing the incident and 
ask for a commitment in writing to reform security in lieu of legal 
action.  That's just fucked up, we're adults here now, when you go to 
some fancy, expensive club you can have a 100% "pretty god damn 
reasonable" expectation not to have some dickhead meathead employee hit 
you with a a beer bottle, not to mention all the other shit that's been 
mentioned.

Subject: {pb-cle} Ishkur/Tiesto DVD Review

Did anyone else catch Ishkur on the radio? That snarky scenester.

I got to browsing his site for the first time in a minute, and set my eyes
on this DVD Review of Tiesto "in Concert". If tom cox went to Canada, his
name would probably be Ishkur. His views would also get more universal.
Regardless, this review is loads of fun:

http://ishkur.com/exposes/articles/tiestoinconcert.htm


DVD Review: Tiesto in Concert
A vapid exercise in tedium and tasteless idolatry

It's interesting to note that at one time rock n roll was considered dance
music. The teenage parties and sock-hops of the 50s consisted mostly of open
dance floors and eager, kinetic people frolicking about. They were social
institutions first and foremost, where the aim was to have fun with your
friends and share in the music that you all enjoy. Going for the party.

But as time went on, rock became less and less of a dance music medium. The
performer, through appropriate marketing, became more important than the
music he made, turning into an object of worship that transcended the
purpose of the event. Concerts, accordingly, became less and less focused on
the dancing and socializing aspects of the attendees and more about paying
homage to the rock star ingratiating himself on stage, relishing in his
status as a living teen god. Going for the rock star.

Dance music and rock music have officially merged
This is the direction that electronic dance music also wants to take, and
leading the charge is the bloated Dutch super DJ Tiesto. This DVD, an
intimate portrayal of the man in concert, professes to be a landmark event
in the history of dance music. The first part is true: This is definitely a
concert, and nothing but. It is not a club, not a rave, not even a dance
party, and it borderlines on being an actual DJ performance. It is a
concert, and Tiesto is a rock star. The second part is unsubstantiated
hyperbole. Just what is so groundbreaking here? That they managed to fit
25,000 people inside a club? Is that an attendance record for a DJ set? I
seem to remember historic parties like Castlemorton, Glastonbury and the
Love Parade having more acclaim than this. For something advertised as "a
planetary first", you'd expect things that have never been attempted before
by anyone, both technically and artistically. After watching this, I
struggled to find reasons why Tiesto is considered a DJ at all, much less
the #1 DJ in the world, when it's clear he'd rather be a narcissistic rock
star instead.

The concert performance is three hours long. Despite the slick production
(the concert is really well done and professional), there really isn't a
whole lot to look at. You get the gist of what's going on five minutes in,
and then you realize there's more of the same for the next three hours, so
it's not necessary to sit and watch the whole thing all the way through. I
went to the bathroom four times, cooked and ate two meals, read the paper,
and checked my email several times. I didn't miss much. Every time I
returned to the TV, the same image was still plastered all over the screen:
Tiesto's smug expression celebrating his supremacy over the docile dance
masses. Is this the part that is so groundbreaking and revolutionary?

If they removed the DJ stage, they could've fit 5000 more people in there,
easily
The performance in a nutshell: a DJ plays music and people dance. He is at
least fifty feet away from them, surrounded by gigantic, electric light rods
that jettison out from the DJ booth in every direction like a massive power
conduit, as if to say that the universe truly does revolve around him. But
although the people can't see what he's doing, you can. Tiesto's face gets
99% screen time from every camera, and they pan, zoom, and switch back and
forth like a frantic MTV music video. There are occasions on the DVD where
you can select alternate camera angles, but those don't seem to make too
much of a difference since the perspective keeps changing every few seconds.
The bullet-time "Matrix" shots are choppy and rotate about 30 degrees tops.
Tiesto himself does about thirty seconds of actual DJing every five minutes.
The rest of the time he spends dwelling on his self-importance. He smiles,
waves his arms in the air, leaves the booth on several occasions, talks to
people, and jumps up and down. Is this the part that is so groundbreaking
and revolutionary?

With so much emphasis on the performer, what does the performance have going
for it? Well, Tiesto's formula seems structured around playing overbearing
super megatrance interspersed with subdued vocal trance. On two occasions we
are graced by "live" vocalists, who come out on extended platforms rising
above the stage, and they lip-synch solemnly through their lyrics. But it's
merely for show. It's as if they're just paying tribute to the songs they
did vocals for a long time ago but haven't sang since and haven't had any
other part in the production process. Although a nice touch, they didn't
really seem to add to the exuberance of the occasion at all. Is this the
part that is so groundbreaking and revolutionary?

Sadly, there doesn't seem to be any surprises in Tiesto's performance. The
whole set has been carefully crafted together and planned beforehand, much
like any concert. The old DJ tactic of encouraging spontaneity in music, of
reading the crowd and choosing tracks on the fly have no place here. There
are 38 tracks played in all. 13 of those tracks are Tiesto's own. This
concert is all about Tiesto, after all, and he revels in every egregious,
self-serving minute of it. Halfway through I felt like I was watching a
gigantic infomercial selling commercialized Tiesto for your mass
consumption. Is this the part that is so groundbreaking and revolutionary?

There is an MC. He is totally and completely unnecessary. He praises Tiesto
shamelessly, high-fiving him and cheering on the crowd like an idiot.
Halfway through the set he shouts, "This is DJ Tiesto!" Oh! Have we
magically forgotten who that is in the middle of the ridiculously huge stage
with twirling lightning rods surrounding it? It reminded me of The Beatles
performance in Shea Stadium in 1965, where it didn't matter what they
played--the people loved it. John Lennon banged on the piano with his elbows
like a retarded monkey, and the crowd screamed in approval. Tiesto also
possesses this awesome power. He could take a dump on the tables and the
people would think it's the greatest song ever. Now, wouldn't that be
something truly groundbreaking and revolutionary?

No he's not
On seven occasions Tiesto stops the music entirely. Four of these are
extended intermissions (because, you know, how tough it is to mix six tracks
in a row), where Tiesto leaves the DJ booth for several minutes while a
sideshow plays. This is the gimmick of the concert: each sideshow represents
a region of the world, starting with Europe, then America, Asia, Africa, and
finishing with Australia. After each sideshow is done, Tiesto returns
wearing a new shirt emblazoned with the region. After the America
performance, for instance, where bikers, breakdancers, and cheerleaders all
shuffle around to Jimi Hendrix' rendition of the Star-spangled Banner at
Woodstock, Tiesto emerges brandishing a baseball T with the infamous "I
(heart) NY" logo. But there is no cohesive theme to any of this, and in
hindsight it seems rather pointless. Tiesto's music doesn't have anything to
do with the region he's conquering. After the Asia sideshow, I expected
Tiesto to start playing music with Asian influences. There was none. The
music is still the same Euro trance all the way through. So why bother with
the gimmicks at all, if they have nothing to do with the concert? What is
the point of all these stoppages, except to save Tiesto from doing too much
mixing?

Probably the most insulting moment of the intermissions, however, is the
Africa sideshow. It features a real band playing real instruments, with
drums, congas, bass guitars and soul singers, reflecting the earthy, organic
tribal atmosphere of African culture, but half of the sound is completely
killed off. Next to the booming trance music of Tiesto, with its mammoth
subs and surround sound systems, the Africa performance sounds positively
lame. I'm not sure if that's a deliberate affront to the band or not, but it
seems as if the concert organizers want to make the statement that live
music can't sound as good as pre-recorded music. Or maybe they do not want
actual musicians outshining Tiesto in his element. At any rate, the way the
levels are set forced me to turn up the volume in order to hear the band. Is
this a DVD flaw, or is Tiesto the only thing that matters here?

There is a second DVD, but all it has is more Tiesto. Tiesto extras, Tiesto
music videos, Tiesto commercials. It is mostly redundant filler, not even
worth a go-through once.

The benchmark of true skill and craftsmanship in any endeavor is seeing what
impact it has on someone completely foreign to the whole profession. I don't
know much about world class gymnasts, but I can at least appreciate and
respect what they do, for it is a level of competence few can achieve. When
it comes to DJing, however, especially DJing in the manner that Tiesto does,
there is nothing there. The whole experience is empty, superfluous fluff.
About as filling as cotton candy. But maybe that's just my bias. So I passed
the DVD on to a friend of mine who knew nothing about electronic music and
even less about DJs to see if he can acquire an impartial appreciation for
the #1 DJ in the world, and he returned with this honest response: "I don't
get it. What's he doing that's so great? He's playing music, right? ....So
what."

Indeed. So what? So what has Tiesto got going for him?

Well, he's famous. And he's famous for being famous. And that seems to be
the strength of his PR machine. Do people really go for the music anymore,
or do they need the aimless hype of glorified jukeboxes to tell them what
music is good? If someone else had played Tiesto's exact set, would they
receive just as much praise, or would they be ignored because they're not
Tiesto? If a shower curtain were draped around the decks, would people even
be able to tell it was Tiesto playing? What is the value of a DJ when he
doesn't even have to play records in order to be revered now?

Tiesto is not a DJ. He is an attention whore who has done a really good job
marketing himself as a DJ. He is a businessman selling himself as a DJ. He
is a rock star under the guise of a DJ. But he is not a DJ.

Buy this DVD only if you really really really like Tiesto. Don't buy this
DVD if you really really really like trance.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Jeff Samuel/Plate Tec reminder

We haven't had a good thoroughly minimal tech night in
cleveland since Matt Dear played for Warm Art last
year...hell yes I'm looking forward to this!  Between
Jeff, Mike, Derek, and Damon it's going to be a solid
night from start to finish to say the least.

Timeslots (tentative of course)
Damon Havill 9-10
Derek Johnson 10-11:30
Mike Salamon 11:30-1
Jeff Samuel 1-close

Keep in mind here that we're going to let Jeff play as
long as he wants to, so I wouldn't expect to be going
home exactly at 2:30:)

I think the first half alone of 2003 definately gave me last 
year's crown... if you're familiar with the "morning update"...

Easily wasted 2 solid hours every morning from the point when i 
walked in the door till i sent out the email.  then for the 
following 6 hours it was usually split up between list mail and 
instant messenger.

I'm lucky if a day comes along now where I can respond to list 
mail, or even read it.

Subject: {pb-cle} "Confessions of a Burning Man"

Just got in from a great weekend in NYC. Record release party was superb; city and people as always are a joy, too much to do and too little time to fit it all in.

Yesterday I caught an indie film called "Confessions of a Burning Man" that I highly recommend for anyone who has been to, or who has any inkling of ever going to the Burning Man festival in Nevada. 

While the film itself leaves a lot to be desired, it's a great view of how Black Rock City is constructed. The documentary also profiles spiritual journeys of a few people seeking to unload personal issues baggage.  

The movie obviously barely scratches the surface of what goes on there, but it shows it realistically in terms of the "responsibility for self" aspect.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} never underestimate the stupidity of young people...

I know I've read this before in recent months.  Must be a slow news day for 
CNN - so I looked because I'm bored.

Seems like a rehash of this article:
Dec 19 - http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/12/19/tv.youngviewers.ap/

Jan 27 - http://www.nationalreview.com/document/dean200401271336.asp

Jan 22 - http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/tv/157538_tv22.html

Jan 12 - http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3937388/

Atleast CNN dropped their act of trying to be 'trendy'

yeah i read this article, but its not really the same. the Pew 
polls arent mentioned, neither are the ratings for young men 
during the caucuses/primaries/SotU weeks. the things this shows 
are just craziness. that dumb bitch who said "health care for old 
people" doesnt affect her is my new fucking hero. what a fucking 
moron. hopefully it wont matter to her because shell die real 
soon, preferably by getting run over by a very big truck.

Getting run over by a very big truck isn't national news worthy.  Maybe
getting crushed by a helicopter would be better?  I haven't heard of anybody
crushed by a helicopter.... well at least lately...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} never underestimate the stupidity of young people...

Heh...while I agree that this is a "dubious" source of news at BEST, there are some very valid
points to think about here:


1) the content of The Daily Show is no more biased than that of network news...it just does it in a
less subtle way, and tends to give equal time to skewering both sides of the political fence.

2) john stewart, as a "celebrity personality" is believed to be more credible a source of
information on his worst day than any of the talking heads of network news on their best.

3) local news is a barren wasteland of vapid stories, and the fact that it leads into the network
news surely does not help matters.

i can't seem to put a finger on why exactly, but i seem to get more out of 30 minutes of news on BBC
america than i do in an hour of any of the networks' news shows (including cnn/headline news). i
also try to catch some of the other news shows on the international channels, and i'm a die-hard NPR
supporter.

but i do find The Daily Show entertaining...not news.

Brassiere? Will he be sporting one of those jaunty, push-up types?

Or will he go full-on for the water-filled job.....

i would argue that at least you can easily decode a network's 
bias. comedy can be used to distort any issue in any manner 
whereas the networks' motivations are pretty easily discernable. 

>2) john stewart, as a "celebrity personality" is believed to be 
more credible a source of

i dont know man. maybe im old fashioned, but i think dan rather is 
a pretty upstanding human being. i actually for a while was into 
reading network anchors' biographies. i think i read brokaw and 
rather and someone else, cant remember who. no offense meant to 
jon stewart, but he has a long way to go in understanding current 
events compared to those cats. 

>3) local news is a barren wasteland of vapid stories, and the

its really not too hard to totally ignore local newscasts, im 
pretty good at it.

more out of 30 minutes of news on BBC

obviously american news in general tends to water down things. i 
wonder if this might be a mix up of cause and effect? ive long 
believed that reporters should cover more hard news and less 
fluffy bullshit, and maybe this tendency to liek 
the "entertaining" guy instead of the supposedly "informative" guy 
is a result of all that fluff. 

>but i do find The Daily Show entertaining...not news.

absolutely, its good stuff. i just fear for the day when the stuff 
i hear on there im hearing for the first time. itll never happen, 
nevermind.

I had this talk at work today, about what we thought

with the tune was priceless.

I am so sick of 80's music.  I had to hear that shit enough in high school.

Yeah I picked this up a while ago.  Honestly I can't even remember what it
sounds like, I usually buy all defunked when it becomes available, but
recently the stuff is lackluster with a few exceptions.  It was great to
hear phantom 45 play those defunked records, and see people get down
to it.

How can you say that A-Ha was a 'one hit wonder'... yeah, they spoke hardly 
any english, didn't understand much of what they said, were typical 80's 
cute and couldn't, in Tom's School of Objective Evaluation, be credited 
with significant contributions to a genre... AND they took full advantage 
of the 'new' medium of music video to boost their success... but 'one hit 
wonders'?  maybe 'one cd wonders' (or really 'one album wonders' for that 
time) would be more appropriate.

'Hunting High and Low' had at least 2 (Take on Me & The Sun Always Shines 
on TV) big popular hits and several more minor hits that had lots of 
college airplay during the '80s.  That was actually a kickass CD.

I've got one of the best memories in my life to The Sun Always Shines on

Subject: {pb-cle} this past wkend

friday -  the third eye..... (and buckeye brewing) ..... lots of fun. 
thanks to everyone that came out for my bday.  even if you didn't know 
and were still there, who cares, everyone had fun in any event....  
thanks luke for the party!

saturday -  DSL at moda.  had alot of fun, the crowd was totally into it 
despite the sound issues. and well the security thug issues ruined 
things for a couple people i guess.  fire them all and hire strippers!  
anyhow i hope the mythodic gang and jessica can get shit worked out with 
security there. i know they've been trying...  i hope they bring out 
more jungle (some UK guys would be dope, R.A.W. maybe too!!) and get the 
kinks worked out on the sound.

sunday, R&R....

Right Said Fred.

Massive overplay, one gimmick, bad video, then gone.

Exemplary performance for a one-hit-wonder.

wow...

i think i'd have to go with tom tom club's "genius of love". it's been played to death since the
mid-90's, but that beat and that bassline are amazing. one of my favorites of all time.

since we're talking 80's, some other notables in no particular order:

tainted love
let the music play (shannon)
white horse (laid back)
pass the dutchie
let's go all the way (sly fox)
pump up the volume

I had this talk at work today, about what we thought
were the best one hit wonders. I honestly think "Aha -
Take On Me" was the best since the video that went
with the tune was priceless.

anyone else?

Thw producers name is TC. He's from Bristol and has
been releasing some nice tunes since last summer.

Funny how this tune is really catchy. Almost sounded
like it was meant to be a dnb tune in the first place.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} never underestimate the stupidity of young people...

<<i would argue that at least you can easily decode a network's bias. comedy can be used to distort
any issue in any manner whereas the networks' motivations are pretty easily discernable.>>

well, tom...YOU can...and I can...but I know people who earnestly believe in their heart of hearts
that Fox News Channel is as completely "fair and balanced" as they claim to be.

you are the exception, not the rule. not everyone can decode these things, and as the school system
in our country doesn't seem to be getting any better and apparently is content with churning out
good little consumer drones, methinks the problem is going to get worse before it gets better.

<<i dont know man. maybe im old fashioned, but i think dan rather is a pretty upstanding human
being. i actually for a while was into reading network anchors' biographies. i think i read brokaw
and rather and someone else, cant remember who. no offense meant to jon stewart, but he has a long
way to go in understanding current events compared to those cats.>>

i have little use for many of the network anchor-types, though i will concede that rather is
probably the best of our time.

i just lost all respect when i watched peter jennings inject his own political bias into a
discussion with westley clark after michael moore called bush a "deserter" during a clark political
rally. jennings was, i would assume, completely offended by the statement and was really hell bent
on punishing clark for something one of his celebrity supporters said.

another example would be diane sawyer, who played dean's "primal scream" ad nauseum during one of
her broadcasts (though, that probably wasn't a network news show...it was likely one of those
'infotainment' shows like primetime live....)

<<and maybe this tendency to liek the "entertaining" guy instead of the supposedly "informative" guy
is a result of all that fluff.>>

oh, it ABSOLUTELY is...it's all about the ratings game, which is what has made local tv news the
shit-fest that it is.

i know this probably wasn't my point to begin with, but i think it boils down to this: i'd rather
have people reading "The Onion" than "Weekly World News"...

Just like I'd rather have people watching "The Daily Show" rather than Fox's 24 Hour GOP News
Channel or "Celebrity Trailer Trash Deathmatch featuring Tonya Harding and Willis from Diff'rent
Strokes"

i only like garbage house versions of that. 

i spent most of yesterday listening to the 7:34 long version 
of "caribbean queen" by billy ocean over and over and over again 
trying to make myself sick of it. it didnt work. not a one hit 
wonder, but a great corny 80s joint nonetheless.

i have a jungle remix of this track that is just off the chain. 
its a legit rmx too, it was on the 12" single. 

>domino - ghetto jam

nah, "sweet potato pie" while basically the same song was also a 
big hit. getto jam is the better one though (got em both on 
vinyl ;)

>lo fidelity allstars - battleflag  (fuck "sleeping faster", it

that track was hot. IIRC it was actually a remix of some band 
called "pigeonhead" or something from seattle. they hated it.

for anyone who slept on them (adam) the gravediggaz are 
classic. "6 ft deep" is an absolute classic. i mean come on, how 
can you be a one hit wonder when your group features the RZA from 
the wu, frukwan from stetsasonic, and prince paul from stetsasonic 
and producer of classic de la soul joints? i used to rock that 
album in the tape deck of my car, im going to have to dig it out 
again.

<<apple juice kissin in the jam>>

Dewdrops in the Garden, on the whole, was a far superior album to their previous efforts.

But, alas, it still wasn't a hit.

<<does anyone remember when they played at metropol in 94 or so ?  gooood rave memory :)>>

I vaguely remember seeing them somewhere...was it in the summer? I can't remember if I saw them in
Pgh. or not...

dude, deelite is not a one hit wonder.  they've toured several times and i
know like 5 people with office jobs who own their tapes and cds.  a ton of
their songs are on 12" vinyl - good beat, power of love, try me on, call me.

get out of town.

I saw Lady Miss Keir *attempt* to spin a drum n bass set once in 1997.

It was atrocious.

She picked the needle up off the record and put it back at the beginning 
like 6 times, lol

She sang over the records, which was awesome, and I know she isn't a DJ, 
but it was still hilarious.

That freaking song has been in my head since I jumped on this thread...And I don't even own it so I can't listen to it!
 
Oh, and what about the Ghettoboys, "My Minds Playin' Tricks on Me.." That was the jam - they may have had more stuff out but that's the only track that comes to mind right now..

I'm certainly not looking to start a flame war on this topic....and I'm not disputing that they've
released many SINGLES....even many albums.

But in the context of this discussion, we were talking about hits...
Without getting too far into the semantics of it, I took that to mean "songs that more than likely
reached Billboard's Top 40 and got played in regular rotation on commercial radio"...

Therefore, Deee-Lite _DOES_ indeed qualify as a one-hit wonder.

Ask ANY 10 average people on the street to name a Deee-Lite song other than "Groove Is In The
Heart"....I'm willing to bet you'll get lots of blank stares and shrugged shoulders.

<<get out of town.>>

Love to...Where we goin'? Someplace with sand and sun and 80 degree temperatures? I need a vacation,
yo....

m
PS - that Dr. Rubberfunk track that uses a sample from "Groove Is In The Heart" is teh new
hottness.....

Why is it they call it "taking a dump" instead of "leaving a dump"? You're not really taking it

I thought of another good one:

They had that one jam from the Dawson's Creek/She's All That soundtracks,
"Kiss Me," and then disappeared back into their church choir or some shit.
 During a period of my life when I was watching MTV/VH1 all day long, I
saw them attempt to make a comeback with a horrid cover of that song
"There She Goes."

?!?!??!!?!??!?!??!

you guys didnt listen to hiphop in the eary 90s. the geto boys 
were classic, even if they didnt have another top 40 type joint. i 
mean seriously, im going to go dig out my cassette copy of "we 
can't be stopped" now as well. that shit is fantastic all the way 
through. and what about scarface's "mr scarface"? that shit was 
banging in the hallways of arsenal middle school circa 1991. 

other hiphop from that time that isnt a one hit wonder:

black sheep
jungle brothers
digable planets
das efx
craig mack
etc

the definition of one hit wonder for me is someone who came out of 
nowhere and had only one good song. if they had one hit from an 
album full of classics, it just doesnt count.

I will ask 10 people in my office here (between the ages of 18 and 34...i doubt anyone older would

I'm slacking this afternoon, true. But I do have a job that keeps me fairly busy.

i think that hits should be relative, especially if youre talking 
about something that is a hit that came from an underground music 
scene. i mean, kenny dope never had a hit like "the bomb!" but if 
someone called him a one hit wonder i might want to punch them. i 
have a couple dee-lite 12"s that are very very hot. i wouldnt ever 
call them a one hit wonder. 

>in light of the thread:

thats a great track. what about that "life is a highway" track 
from like 93 by tom cochrane. that was the business in a corny 
mainstream rock kinda way. and that one 97 or so track about 
breakfast at tiffany's was like crack rocks for me for a long 
time.

when i saw her in clev, she kinda mixed.  or wrecked more 
appropriately....  she had an MC to try and cover her fuckups, he would 
only jump into it when she was wrecking.... she got out and sang a few 
times.  it was pretty funny as well.  why bother this routine tho, just 
fucking get a dat and sing over it....

Deep Purple - Breakfast at tiffany's... thank you tom, that song 
is still in my top 10 "songs that have nostalgic meaning"... and i 
can still listen to it whenever it's on... 

that song came out when there was another one hit wonder that you 
reminded me of

Tony Rich Project - Nobody Knows

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} best one hit wonder

<<If God is speaking through them, being a Christian band and all, he should shut the hell up.>>

SPEAKING OF THIS... my friend mentioned on his blog something about Stacie Orrico being a Christian
act as well, and I was like "WHAT?"

Is this like the trendy thing to do to gain a fan base before breaking into the mainstream?

Reminds me of that South Park episode with Cartman's "Faith Plus One"...


"I love you Jesus, baby...."

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} best one hit wonder

i got my first taste of the jungle brothers from a tape that shady bill/black
bill gave me.  it seriously had a huge impact on my music life.  i'd say right
along with rage against the machine.  hearing those 2 groups for the first
time are bigger life experiences for me that graduating from college or 
buying a house.

Yeah 80's as in:

run dmc

fat boys
whodini
public enemy
nwa
doug e fresh and mc rickie dee
metalica
slayer
anthrax
etc.

made me what I am today, not that one hit wonder crap.  I will agree 
with you on the cure though, I have been listening to mixed up all week 
long. That album was a major influence on me.

>paul fleetwood is thinking of casey kasem though ;)

When I think Casey Kasem, I think two things:

1. The Alf episode when he goes on Casey's show as a comedian and gets boo'd 
off for telling the same jokes.

2. Ghostbusters... I think Dana is in the kitchen chopping up some lettuce 
in the kicthen. (ZOOL LIVES IN THE ICEBOX!)

Please tell me the Fine Young Cannibals had more than one 'hit'? Because 
they rock.

Same goes for the Pet Shops Boys. They had more than one single right?

<<but the CURE owns you all.>>

you don't even KNOW about some Robert Smith.

whiny, pale white boys the world over owe him their left testicles and first born male children,
should they ever conceive.

<<(yes i know they arent considered a "one hit wonder")>>

not even close...though by my (admittedly WRONG) definition earlier in the thread, i guess they
would, since i think "Friday I'm in Love" was their only Top 40 showing in America....

Subject: {pb-cle} nrr: political agenda behind stern's removal from clear channel

This is a very interesting article addressing questions about the motives behind Clear Channel's
yanking of the Stern show from 6 of their markets.

http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/03/04/stern/

This is precisely the sort of scenario that media watchdog groups warned of when the FCC loosened
regulations on how many stations corporations could own in a given market or multiple markets. The
fact that this is even becoming a possibility lends frightening creedence to their warnings.

Erf. Fucking whiney crap. It's awful. Period. Put them in a cart with 
Morissey and  shove them off a cliff.

Perhaps the dance music world has more one hit wonders than people with 
staying power?

Subject: {pb-cle} semi-rr: dj's of mass destruction

http://hiphopslam.com/label/index.html

The DJs of Mass Destruction have dropped a hip hop compilation of DJ and emcee tracks centered
around a theme of war, peace, and US foreign policy, in particular the 2003 war on Iraq.

A lot of the tracks on the disc cleverly use samples from network news, and from George W. Bush
himself...There are tracks from P.E., Mr. Lif, and Steinski's "It's Up To You", which was recorded
sometime around the first Gulf War....funny that the names haven't changed in over a decade...

I'm checking this out right now, and plan to buy a copy. You should check it out as well.

Timeslots (tentative of course)
Damon Havill 9-10
Derek Johnson 10-11:30
Mike Salamon 11:30-1
Jeff Samuel 1-close

Keep in mind here that we're going to let Jeff play as
long as he wants to, so I wouldn't expect to be going
home exactly at 2:30:)

Subject: {pb-cle} nrr: Republicans change party Emblem

Washington, D.C.: The Republican National Committee announced today that the 
Republican Party is changing its emblem from an elephant to a condom.

Ed Gillespie, Republican National Committee Chairman explained that the 
condom more clearly reflects the party's stance today, because a condom 
accepts inflation, halts production, precludes a next generation, and 
protects a bunch of pricks while they're raping and pillaging.

next day or something, which I don't in this case, more drinking goodness :)

Subject: {pb-cle} No love for the midwest

Jassen here...My first post in a while to PB-Cleve...

I read this week's Scene and the article about Jeff Samuel.

---Begin quote---
Cellura views Samuel as an antidote to the "stagnation of the same 
old prog-house/retro house that has held back people's understanding 
of where techno music is going for so long." He's pleased to see 
Samuel's records "getting into the hands of the biggest DJs in [the 
tech-house] scene right now: Ricardo Villalobos, Michael Mayer, 
Triple R, Sven V=E4th."

After nearly two years in Seattle, Samuel thinks his new home base 
has more advantages than did Cleveland's electronic scene.

"There's way less of an ego problem [in Seattle]," he says. "I was 
very surprised by how well the guys working on electronic music here 
get along. Everybody's mutually supportive."

You didn't feel that in Cleveland?

"F*ck no, I didn't. In terms of people in the business in Cleveland, 
most of them were on this dumb track of trying to be the best DJ in 
the world and play the biggest raves. That wasn't in my itinerary. I 
was thinking much larger than that. I want to play clubs in Europe; 
they appreciate it more and the money's better -- and you get to go 
to Europe and not have to pay for it. I had different agendas than 
the people in Cleveland. Dan [Curtin] was the only guy I could look 
up to as a role model."

---End quote---

These days, Cleveland (especially the Abbasso - where Samuel is 
playing) seems like a really supportive place.

My observation is that the Cleveland people seem to support one 
another.  When the music is good,  I see the owners of clubs at other 
clubs and a lot of familiar faces at all the different spots in town.

Does anyone else think that this interview attempts to drag the 
momentum that is building?

Jassen
PS - I posted a similar query to the nitty gritty forum...

think they're afforded a better luxury of people still raving out that way.
The scene is huge period, no matter if you're a trance DJ or a laptop
musician. Not a whole lotta love for the DNB kids tho. From Portland to
Seattle, shit is jumpin. Playing big shows here, and wanting people to come
out in droves is probably the better take on what he's saying. It's the
current home of all things independant electronic (the PDX/Seattle/NW
scene), and has a load more support, but I'll also give that it has a much
higher population base.

BUT. I'll also say that if I dragged out my laptop and some synths, you'd
all fucking stare at me and argue the next day that I didn't use vinyl and
it wasn't real and I didn't provide the correct "vibe" as it might be put.

It's different. There's more going on, so he probably finds a better home in
whatever he does.

Jassen here...My first post in a while to PB-Cleve...

I read this week's Scene and the article about Jeff Samuel.

---Begin quote---
Cellura views Samuel as an antidote to the "stagnation of the same
old prog-house/retro house that has held back people's understanding
of where techno music is going for so long." He's pleased to see
Samuel's records "getting into the hands of the biggest DJs in [the
tech-house] scene right now: Ricardo Villalobos, Michael Mayer,
Triple R, Sven Vth."

After nearly two years in Seattle, Samuel thinks his new home base
has more advantages than did Cleveland's electronic scene.

"There's way less of an ego problem [in Seattle]," he says. "I was
very surprised by how well the guys working on electronic music here
get along. Everybody's mutually supportive."

You didn't feel that in Cleveland?

"F*ck no, I didn't. In terms of people in the business in Cleveland,
most of them were on this dumb track of trying to be the best DJ in
the world and play the biggest raves. That wasn't in my itinerary. I
was thinking much larger than that. I want to play clubs in Europe;
they appreciate it more and the money's better -- and you get to go
to Europe and not have to pay for it. I had different agendas than
the people in Cleveland. Dan [Curtin] was the only guy I could look
up to as a role model."

---End quote---

These days, Cleveland (especially the Abbasso - where Samuel is
playing) seems like a really supportive place.

My observation is that the Cleveland people seem to support one
another.  When the music is good,  I see the owners of clubs at other
clubs and a lot of familiar faces at all the different spots in town.

Does anyone else think that this interview attempts to drag the
momentum that is building?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} No love for the midwest

What I think Jeff doesn't know is that the edm climate
in this area has changed significantly within the past
year or two.  based on what little I knew of
cleveland's edm scene three or four years ago this
would have been reasonably accurate.  The current
climate, however, is a lot different (a lot more
cross-traffic between cliques and clubs, more people
hanging out, a LOT more good music being brought in). 
Hopefully he'll get that idea over his stay and walk
away with a different opinion.  

I'm guessing that when he left the ONLY night that
catered to minimal techno and perhaps even underground
dance music at all on a consistant basis was shift. 
Things are a little different these days.

So no, i don't think the interview is attempting to
drag anything down, i think that he based his coments
on an older and thankfully left-behind incarnation of
cleveland's edm scene.  I hope I'm right.

I think Cleveland is extraordinarily supportive.  Being a sort of
closet DJ myself these days (I've been working more in the direction
of producing some of my own material which takes time away from the
decks), when I do want to spin out, I know of at least a few places
where I could go almost any day of the week.  Not only that, but the
people at these venues (especially Abbasso) have been supportive, fun
to hang out with and understanding.  No attitudes, no dick waving, 
just hard pounding electronic music.  The way God intended it.

Pah.  It's a shame Samuel believes what he does, and yes as always he
has the right to whatever opinion he holds dear.  I don't see the
comments having a lasting impact, though.  Those who know spread the
good word and those who don't will hopefully pick up on it.

grammar police ups to kelly delaney for using the word "compatriot" :)

and to domu who's taking a train from ny to be here tonight.  i think a train
ride is longer than a car ride here.  he has to be a good guy.

and it's nice outside.  wash your car and then get to sauce !

Or how about just having a mix cd play for 15 mins while they are setting up?  
If it's just ambient stuff at a low volume, just so that it isn't dead 
silent.  And they should be able to spare the line in even until they get one 
of the laptops going so that they can switch it over to that while setting up 
everything else.  I can't remember the radio term for it, but dead silence is 
really bad.  if you hear that on a radio station, you change the station.  
don't here anything in a room, you go to a different one.

How about - they should be professional and setup beforehand, ie, get to
the venue early, setup all the gear and soundcheck it.  Shawn and the
lukes never have a problem and they bring out tons of hardware, including
laptops, multiple mixers, midi interfaces, etc.  headphones can do wonders
if you can't sound check on a system.. you should definitely be able to at
least monitor the main out of the rig.

The term you are talking about in radio is "dead air" . . I believe if you
have 12 seconds of dead air while you're broadcasting you are in violation
of FCC rules and can be fined. (at least that's how it was when I was at
WRCT).

Good idea with the CD. A monkey could have realized it was better than
nothing. But as far as their setup, both times it was the promoters fault
(arguably) because what ended up having is the equipment was just scattered
around or under the turntables' table, and they had to put their stuff up
and the Decks down, all while installing and such...so its not a matter of
them being late to the VENUE per say.

Let's just all keep in mind it really isn't all about the Abbasso "the building" anyhow...it really is about Napoleon and all his efforts over the past years, and the heads, and the music, and people's ideals about the way music and the scene should be.  Napoleon put a lot of hard hours and took a lot of crap to give so many people a chance to play, so many crews a chance to do their thing, and a place that a lot of people thought felt like a home, a place where all sorts of people were welcome and felt comfortable. He probably did so much more than some of us would ever even really know, and he deserves to see all his work not go to waste, and hopefully everything will work out for the best however that may be.

One of my highlights of coming there was saying hi to the man himself. I
wasn?t always there but I learned quickly that Naps played an important role
not just at abbasso, but in the local scene by doing what he was doing. You
speak sooth, Val.

Let's hope something gets ressolved.

Here Here I agree.. well said Val. I hope we all can put half the effort Nap
did into Abbasso. I am start to see regrowth of our beautiful scene
regardless of this set back. I will miss the great times, great talent,
great line-ups, great people, and even tetris. lets hope Naps gets
somethings goin' on somewhere else soon. If he needs help I am in!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} abbasso

a few things from my point of view to add a little
more perspective to this.

1.  There are four owners of abbasso (1 family, four
owners)  The three that weren't involved with
Saturday's goings on may not have the same perspective
on things as the fourth.  We all have yet to see what
happens as far as that goes.

2.  What went on at abbasso was built by napoleon with
the help of many individuals.  If things work out in
such a manner that things have to be rebuilt somewhere
else, so be it.  things may be low key for a while,
but  we made too much progress in the past two years
(thanks to Napoleon in particular and headrush, warm
art, plate tech, and everyone else who brought folks
in and hung out making that vibe what it was) to just
say fuck it because a venue has become unfeasible. 
Valerie's right, a space is in the end just a space. 
it's people and work that make a scene.

3.  There are enough folks working together now that
this will only be a temporary setback.  Period.

4.  Only a few people know exactly what the deal is
right now (and I'm not one of them).  Until we all
know what the deal actually is speculation is a waste
of time.

I really have nothing to add to what's already been said outside of the fact 
it was one of my favorite places to go and spin in cleveland. Napoleon was 
always a class act about everything too.  I'll wait patiently for the next 
incarnation of things.

I was rather saddened by all this, but like someone said (forgot 
their name already) this is all speculation.  I have no idea how much 
Napoleon put into it, all that i know is that he is the coolest 
manager/whatever that I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.  Like 
others have said, I'm more then willing to help if things go to a new 
establishment.

p.s. val, add some content to your orkut profile, jeesh :)

Brittney Sparse from New York will be the featured guest on Monday's show.

Please tune your radio dial to WRUW 91.1 FM on Monday from 10:30pm 
until 12:30am or point your browser to http://www.wruw.org to catch 
the stream.

Brittney Sparse is "sparse music for sparse times" via the laptop 
remix (some new, some old, some unreleased - covering techno, 
breakbeat, hip-hop and house).  Because Brittney needs his "beauty 
sleep" we will be doing the interview early in the show before the 
mix.  Brittney's website is http://www.crtdot.com.

SKJ is away on hiatus for a week.  I will be flying solo.

After the show surf to http://www.beatmatrix.net for a set list.

If this email is spam, drop a short reply...

Thank you for your support - and let us know how we can support you.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} abbasso

I guess this is a list to share information, but in life things happen in
the heat of the moment and until Napoleon says "there are irreconcilable
differences" I don't think we should even be talking about it.  Shutting one
night down early is not the same thing as shutting a rave (spare me the
semantics) down early.  Clubs go on... and the loyality that Napoleon built
will not change at all  - should it be at Abbasso or elsewhere.  Whatever
the reality is, Napoleon has our support, friendship, and respect.

I was rather saddened by all this, but like someone said (forgot
their name already) this is all speculation.  I have no idea how much
Napoleon put into it, all that i know is that he is the coolest
manager/whatever that I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.  Like
others have said, I'm more then willing to help if things go to a new
establishment.

lot of crap to give so many people a chance to play, so many crews a chance
to do their thing, and a place that a lot of people thought felt like a
home, a place where all sorts of people were welcome and felt
comfortable. He probably did so much more than some of us would ever even
really know, and he deserves to see all his work not go to waste, and
hopefully everything will work out for the best however that may be.

We went to see it at the WXTM sneak preview.  This movie is good, but a lot
of the younger people in the audience just didn't get the humor.  You have
to be 1970's to understand a lot of the lines.

not sure how this rumor started, but i don't think abbasso is closed- especially since they are having their four year party this friday with q burns scheduled to play.
 
naps did quit and i know he was a large reason many people went there (including myself).  therefore, the club's future is obviously questionable- but that's not to mean they are closed.  i think people misunderstood the fact that they had "closed" early on saturday night (for reasons i'll let naps describe) and assumed that they had "closed" for good.

Unfortunately I don't think I'm going to be able
to make it down.  I'm spinning in Pittsburgh
Saturday night, and I don't think I'll have the
energy to be traveling two nights in a row.  If
it was up here in Cleveland I would definitely
be there.  Luckily I did get to see him in
Pittsburgh back in August of '00 though.

This is really terrible news. I truly enjoyed going
there, the few times I was able to - it had the nicest
ppl running it and a welcoming, warm atmosphere. =(

Downloadable Kit Provides Blueprint For More Jay-Z Remixes
 
Set includes Black Album a cappella vocals, music samples, audio-editing
tools.

by Joseph Patel


Just a week after one online group protested EMI Music's clampdown on The
Grey Album by organizing "Grey Tuesday," another group is providing fans
with tools to make their own Jay-Z remix albums.

The Jay-Z Construction Set was created by a pair of anonymous 23-year-olds
to give people the tools to create their own Black Album remixes and to
compare them with several other popular ones already circulating on the
bootleg circuit. The kit includes Jay-Z's The Black Album a cappella vocals,
hundreds of classic music samples and simple audio editing software that
will allow users to make their own instrumentals.

Also included are nine CDs' worth of The Black Album remixes - including The
Grey Album from DJ Danger Mouse, The Brown Album from producer Kev Brown and
The Black Remixes from producer Ninth Wonder (see "Remixers Turn Jay-Z's
Black Album Grey, White And Brown") - and various hip-hop clipart images to
construct a custom CD cover.

The Jay-Z Construction Set was launched late Tuesday night by a pair of men
going by the pseudonyms Claire Chanel and Scary Sherman. They're
disseminating the toolkit via the peer-to-peer network BitTorrent. A preview
of the kit and instructions on how to use BitTorrent are available at
jayzconstructionset.com.

"At no point will [that] site serve as a hub," Chanel told MTV News. "We
launched the process off by getting a few CD-ROM copies into the hands of
some people ... and by placing a copy on the BitTorrent network. We hope it
will spread from there."

Theoretically, a user will be able to create their own remix album and add
it to the toolkit, which would then be hosted by their computer for another
person to download. In its original form, the toolkit files total 649 MB.

ive been waiting to hear these rmxes. 9th wonder produced a nice 
lp by little brother as well as "god's stepson" a rmx album of 
nas's "god's son". his beats are hot, he actually did one of the 
original beats on the jay-z record. i wonder if he remixed his own 
joint.....

Well I don't want to fully get into details or start bad mouthing John, but yes I AM DONE working for him. Last Saturday was the straw that broke my back and I CAN NOT tolerate dealing with him any longer. 


BUT the way I would like to go out, as I alway do, is in the party!!! I think this is all ment to be. How better than to go out than this Friday; think of drinking John's FREE booze and enjoying a FREE quality show. I really want this party to be an Anniversary for ALL of us starting something in Cleveland. PLEASE everyone go out this Friday to Abbasso and enjoy the wonderful music and warm company that has made it what it is. This is a fitting end to a GREAT thing, and a turn to more GREAT things to come in the future. I REALLY want this Friday to be one hell of a party, you know the way of "MY" Abbasso. Hope to see everyone this Friday, and on the dance floor!! 

IT'S SO ON!!!!!!!!!!!     

P.S. 
Thank you everyone for all the love and support, it means a lot to me. HUGE RESPECT AND MUCH LOVE!!!! 

"Roads?? Where we're going we don't need roads...!!!!"

Subject: {pb-cle} Does anyone remember Kara McKnight?

Hello. Do any of you on this list remember Kara McKnight? She was a med 
student at Pitt and was really big into the pb-cle rave scene back in the early 
2000s. (2000-2001ish). She used to hang out at the club Area 51 in Pittsburgh. 
Kind of short, blond chick who used to date Ryan Bambao, who unfortunately 
passed away in August 2001. I was a friend of hers but one day she kind of just 
disappeared off the face of the earth. I came across this list and remembered she 
used to frequent it, so I figured I'd see if anyone is still on here who 
knows her. If you have any info, please contact me at ArtofDevistation@aol.com or 
reply to this message. 

Thanks,

Mike

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Does anyone remember Kara McKnight?

1) Getting your facts straight is good.  She never dated Ryan 
Bambao.  To say that is blasphemous.  She only told his parents 
that she was dating him when he passed away.  I'd love to hit that 
bitch with a bat for being that disrespectful.

2)  Kara7@aol.com is her email address, she disappeared right 
after Ryan passed away because I gave her the verbal backlashing 
that she deserved for playing all goodie-goodie when it came to 
her relationship with Ryan, when in fact she was the source of 
most of his life's pain.  Ryan was one of my best friends and one 
of the most amazing people I ever met in my life, so I'm not 
making this shit up.

3) She is a compulsive liar.  Did you know that she was an 
Abercrombie model?  She was also a member of the Pitt Soccer 
team.  She also was pre-med and pre-law at Pitt.  She got invited 
to play for the US Women's Hockey team.  Yeah.  Why the hell would 
you want to associate with someone like that other than the fact 
that she has outstanding nipple rings?

Ooooh, yeah, I remember her.  Frank was talking to her via AIM one night at
Shady Forbes Terrace and mentioned that she was pre-law, pre-med, and got up
every day at like 4:30 to play hockey.  I remember saying, "Yeah, that
sounds feasible, especially since Pitt doesn't even have a specific pre-law
program."

I almost forgot about her 'demo tape' she gave me since she did

It was an IDM track, "port rhombus".

This will actually be more of an informational/social event not necessarily 
a music oriented event.
There will be a speeaker discussing each course, so unfortunately there will 
be lil time for music
after the first tatsing and we have a better idea of how things will flow we 
might find away to incorporate some nice doqwntemp dubs into the evening i 
know this really good downtempo dj guy that would probally be very 
interested.

Hope to see everyone out tonite

Subject: {pb-cle} who wants a website/domain for $2/month

ok here's the deal. we've run out of space on koala-tea.com so i wanted 
to upgrade my storage, but dreamhost is being bitches, they won't let me 
upgrade my plan for any reasonable amount of money. but on the other 
hand i can purchase a second hosting plan with an extra 1.6gb of storage 
for like $19.99 a month.

i don't need the extra domain or anything. but someone out there might 
want it for themselves. so if you are down with paying me $24.95 to 
cover the setup fee, you can have our own domain. 100mb of storage, 
e-mail, cgi and all that for a full year. i will be using up the rest of 
the 1.6gb to store music for koala-tea.com

hit me up if you are interested

Create your own Bush/Cheney campaign poster!!!

Four More Years of Fear and Loathing!
Four More for the Dark Side!

I need more slogans!! Help me people! 
COLLECT EM ALL!!!

I now see why God (and Al Gore) begat the Internet.

a) dreads:cornrows::foot massage:eating pussy
b) dreads:cornrows::peaceful:thuggin
c) dreads:cornrows::milk:cheese
d) dreads:cornrows::the predator:A.I. (she calls her son AI, 
that's outstanding, she might as well call him 'the answer')

Subject: {pb-cle} Latin(esque) hiphop?

Looking for some hiphop / R+B with latin influinces in the production
particularly - not really into Spanish lyrics but wanting that salsa vibe.

Example = Pit Bull - Oye - 2Fast 2Furious Sdtk.

Any recommendations?
Individual songs or artists is fine.
Websites are fine.

Also any good salsa house recommendations are welcome.

{{ Thomas D. Cox, Jr. <death@andythepooh.com> }
why not just rock some real latin music instead? theres all kinds of good
stuff out there. though im definitely no expert on that kind of stuff, i can
definitely appreciate it. i know soulseek has lots of latin and brazilian
stuff on there.... }}

Well, if it's Latin instrumental that's fine, but if I'm listening to
something with lyrics I want to be able to understand them.

alot of salsa stuff is instrumental. i like vocal stuff i cant 
understand. the obvious stuff is good too, like that buesna vista 
social club type biz on Nonesuch. i think the spanish harlem 
orchestra are ill too, if thats the name of the people with the 
Fruitmeat release that Selekta always plays......

well i just got back from miami, and i have to say that this is not good news to come back to.. abbasso is by far my favorite club in cleveland, and pretty much the only one i really go to.. ive had some really good times, and met alot of awesome people.. napoleon has done a tremendous job in managing abbasso and also helped by bringing something to cleveland that cleveland rally needed, great atmosphere, great talent, and great ppl all at one club..also his continues sportiveness towards my endeavors and support of other artist has also been much appreciated.. napoleon you will be missed.. and i will for sure be out to support this weekend.. see everyone there...

Napoleon put into it, all that i know is that he is the coolest

others have said, I'm more then willing to help if things go to a new
establishment.

Napoleon put a lot of hard hours and took a lot of crap to give so many people a chance to play, so many crews a chance to do their thing, and a place that a lot of people thought felt like a home, a place where all sorts of people were welcome and felt
comfortable. He probably did so much more than some of us would ever even really know, and he deserves to see all his work not go to waste, and hopefully everything will work out for the best however that may be.

Just beginning to receive mail from the past week. Wow. What a lot to
take in, especially after WMC!! My mind is reeling...

I think it goes without saying that after 15 months straight of working
with Naps we're sad to see him go, not to mention how sad it is to see
the walls crumble on something we put so much into...Was great workin'
with ya buddy! 

Great seeing Lindz and Andy James on the plane ride to WMC!

Looking for some hiphop / R+B with latin influinces in the production
particularly - not really into Spanish lyrics but wanting that salsa vibe.

Example = Pit Bull - Oye - 2Fast 2Furious Sdtk.

Any recommendations?
Individual songs or artists is fine.
Websites are fine.

Also any good salsa house recommendations are welcome.

I have a giant collection of Latin type hip hop samples and loops. I 
can fire something off if you can find some accapellas to go over it.

Subject: {pb-cle} Dan Mnookin and Kyle Szmurlo at abbasso 20 March

Hey all:

As the 20th of March will be Napoleon's last day at
Abbasso we've decided to keep the march 20th Warm Art
/ Plate Tectonics show at Abbasso so Naps can leave
there with some great choons in his head at the very
least.  Hopefully with everything else going on that
night folks will get a chance to stop by as Kyle and
Dan are incredibly talented DJ's

The Information:

Dan Mnookin (Proton Radio, Chicago)
Kyle Szmurlo (Relode, ABS, Chicago)
Dan Petrv (Warm Art, Cleveland)
Damon Havill (Plate Tectonics, Cleveland)
Jamie Tyler (Plate Tectonics, Cleveland)

A night of funked-up minimal tech-house and techno.

9pm-5am::$5::21+ please

Abbasso::1222 Prospect::216-566-7278

Plate Tectonics in April (technior audio) will most
likely take place at a different venue.  Stay tuned.

I would go with the MSI k7n2.  The nf7 also has SATA and I noticed 
from this page  http://www.hardocp.com/article.html?art=NDA2 (that's 
for the NF7-s, couldn't find just NF7)  that it comes with one SATA 
to IDE convertor.  But you would basically have to get one of these 
convertors for each drive.  I would just go with the K7N2 and then 
just get yourself a SATA card for when you want to get that later on. 
 Also a couple of my motherboards are MSI and i don't have any 
problems.  As far as pricing goes, I do the middle-of the-road 
approach.  If you get the cheap ones then there's not as many things 
to tweak in the bios, and the high end ones usually have stuff I'm 
not that interested in.

btw, I got info for the K7N2 at 
http://www.extremeoverclocking.com/reviews/motherboards/MSI_K7N2_1.htm

fucking a. im so fucking there. sendex is the man, he always posts 
his new stuff to the AH list so ive been on to him for a minute. 
some of his stuff really ventures into Mr Fingers type territory 
with the old chicago sound but with lots of melody. stinkworx is 
the man too, i love his stuff.

Yo, thanks for the direx Ed. We finally combined our forces and used Jea
Liegh's half drunk directions to get us within an ear shot off BBT and then
we finally ended up asking some1 at a Gas station :-)

friday - we see headrush amy & david on our flight down to miami...awesome! after we check into our hotel(carlton on 15th & collins), lindz and i get some mexican food and then spend the rest of the evening shopping on washington ave. i picked up some choice vinyl at grooveman music, however i still think that bent crayon is the best record shop in the states for cracker techno! we see plenty of beautiful & fake people, latinos, dj/producers/promoters, and clubgoers.
 
saturday - we get up pretty early and head straight to the beach(only a minute away!) for a couple of hours. the weather was perfect for sunbathing! after we chill out at the hotel for a while, we head over to crobar to see carl cox. good thing we bought presales($35!) because when we get there around 11:30, the line was pretty long full of fake looking people who were there to "be seen." finally once we get in the place smells of silicone, cheap cologne, and botox! we had a feeling that this night was going to be lame and it was. carl cox was alright, but the surroundings were too much to handle, plus a bottle of water cost $6...ouch! after an hour of seeing cox we head back to the hotel and crash.
 
sunday - we wake up to the sounds of miami/tribal/progressive house which was pretty cool, but we didn't know that there was going to be a party at our hotel cause we wanted to sleep in. our friends kristin and derek join us in our room later that afternoon then we go downstairs to check out the pool party. randall jones from nyc was throwin down some nice house while we chill poolside. after more shopping, we get ready for the m_nus party at privilege. basically richie destroyed the place for 4 hours of bangin funk, minimal goodness, and some electro! everyone in the place(including us) was going nuts...definitely his best set in a looong time!!!
 
monday - we go back to the beach for some r&r from last night's events. after a nice sun beating we get some seafood with kristin at grillfish a nice seafood restaurant across the street from our hotel. down the street at the ritz carlton was the remix hotel which was basically a big tradeshow/workshop. i got to talk with richie and chris liebing and handed them some beretta wax! i saw some cool new gear including the new technics cd player.
the tronic party that night at privilege was definitely my highlight of the conference...it was a night of cracker techno that i'll never forget! dj preach, john selway, christian smith, misstress barbara, and marco bailey all destroyed it, especially the misstress!!! every cracker in south beach, including those from every part of the states, was at this event! i missed cristian varela because we had to get up early the next morning, but lindz hung in there all night knowing that i was all about this party...thanx baby!!!
 
tuesday - we get up pretty early because we have to drive 4 hours to orlando to visit my parents. later that night i ask lindsey to marry me under a full harvest moon......of course she says yes...what a way to end an amazing trip!!!!!!!!!

Yo, thanks for the direx Ed. We finally combined our forces and used Jea
Liegh's half drunk directions to get us within an ear shot off BBT and then
we finally ended up asking some1 at a Gas station :-)

it was 2dollar coors @ touch last nite


the touch night needs support...especially from the ladies.

i think just about everyone there with the exception of maybe 5 ppl were 
djs/promoters...its good the djs/promoters are out and supporting...but the 
heads need to support this nite too...cleveland needs weekly dnb/jungle

on a high note....touch actually has good scotch...the glen levet gets me

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FREE stuff

I wanted to make it out but our road took us to Pittsburgh (hah- don't ask
what we were on that we got so sidetracked).

FYI - Tik Tak is still doing Jungle Lounge @ Spy and they are getting a good
weekly crowd. Rumor is they are bringing in SUV. Granted Spy is not cheap
and the cover is not free. Don't ask ME why they didn?t bother to say
something to each other of the possible confilct of 2 drum and bass weeklies
on the same night, in a city that can barely support 1.


Back to the title of the subject line, and speaking of dnb, March 27th will
be a FREE show of ALL DnB. There will also be DOLLAR drafts and lots of
other cheap drinx to fill your thirsty tummies. ;-D

Drizzink up,

alex

What about Cdj's? It sucks to see people playing cd's. Maybe I am a purist but there is something about digging thru record bins for dope tracks, not just downloading them. You might as well mix all your tracks digitally on the computer, burn it on a cd and pretend your a real dj.

Um, no it doesn't.  CDs SOUND better, are CHEAPER, are LIGHTER, and SOUND 
BETTER.

Oh, did I mention they SOUND better?

Rock.  It will be great to see you there.  Double
check the flyer though and refresh it.  There was just
a venue change for the better.  Its now at Abbasso. 
Somewhere that actually has a dancefloor.  We are
bringing in some extra sound too.

Actually is a fact that vinyl sounds better than a cd, just ask any true audiophile. Vinyl has a warmer analog sound than cds. Real djs spin vinyl.

and oddly, you can add "warmth" to anything by running it thru tubes or 
other processors.  i'd rather the clarity of a CD and add in whatever 
artifacts you want to.  tapes have "warmth" too and i don't see people 
going crazy to preserve their tape decks and tapes. hell they have 
better "warmth" if you have a good tape, and natural compression too.  
*shrug*
also vinyl has HORRIBLE stereo separation.   you have to watch the phase 
of the tracks when mastering, if you go to far off phase, the groove 
wont hold a needle.

vinyl is only good for a "hands-on" medium, and with the new generation 
of DJ cd players coming out that totally emulate decks, i suspect more 
people will be using them.  some are very slick.

seriously people need to look at some of this technology and start 
thinking about it, some is very useful, and i'd love to get my hands on 
some of it.

Consistency error.

Sorry, I don't live in "I killed Rave because I'm too cool and have a 
small dick" PB-CLE.

Some people in this country still rave, despite what you may have heard.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} wmc review & pics - CDs

You are right, you can emulate the "warmth" of vinyl by runnin it thru tubes, processors, ect. And you are right the technological advances of cd turntables has come a long way. I am sure if you produce music, like our friend Entropy, than it is a lot easier to have cd's of your stuff and play those instead of getting vinyl pressed. I know some dj/producers that I respect that play cds for that reason. I understand where you're coming from though, there are some aspects that are interesting. Still I think there will  always be an abundunce of djs who spin vinyl.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} wmc review & pics - CDs

i do produce music, been lazy about it.  theres also the "dubplate" 
factor where producers can give their songs away if they want.   if its 
used for pirating music, then i don't agree with their use.  we've 
beaten that topic to puree, so lets not go there.  ideally i'd like to 
see a final scratch setup with 2 of these new generation cd players. the 
ones that emulate vinyl on a platter.  its a perfect solution, you can 
use  straight vinyl, hookup your laptop to the final scratch interface.  
the producers can drop stuff on those newer cd players.   or any 
combination of the above.  yes, much more expensive for the promoter to 
provide, but everyone can be happy.  something old, something new, 
something borrowed, something blue.

I am sure if you produce music, like our friend Entropy, than it is a lot easier to have cd's of your stuff and play those instead of getting vinyl pressed. I know some dj/producers that I respect that play cds for that reason. I understand where you're coming from though, there are some aspects that are interesting. Still I think there will  always be an abundunce of djs who spin vinyl.

SATURDAY | March 20 | STACEY PULLEN
Detroit's badass of funky tech-house
I like trying to take people on a musical journey, which means me playing
at least three or four hours. In clubs a lot of people ask What are you
gonna play tonight? and I never know I just play from the heart and I
dont categorise it. I ts house, techno, broken beat or whatever: if the
vibe is right I do it.

audiophiles say they can hear/feel the overtones that are filtered out 
in the digital progess (lookup the nyquist theorem i think).  there are 
ups and downs to both formats.  i don't think cds are any easier to mix 
than vinyl.  you still have to get the tempos correct and the phrasing 
on, just different technique on the formats.  a cd player doesn't make 
this any easier than vinyl that i know of?  different maybe.  anyhow 
mixing on cds is just a stigma.  honestly if you put up a partition and 
had a dj on vinyl and a dj on cds most people wouldn't be able to tell 
the difference unless the records were worn or dirty or popping, or the 
cd skipped.

plus another upside to cds is they can have a "pitch lock" where as you 
change the speed the pitch stays the same.  this is a HUGE benefit if 
you are really getting into djing and mixing stuff in the same key or 
compatible keys that you cant do with vinyl.  but since i cant tell one 
key from another i don't care, but there is a science to that.

seriously if the dj can mix on any format, tape, reel-to-reel, 8-track, 
minidisc and somehow pull off good mixes, who cares the format?

agree with me?
>two 

I'm gonna have to go on a whim here after having spun on cd decks 
for about 7 years now (no experience at all, you know) and say 
that cd decks arent really as easy to mix as records are.  the 
touch factor on vinyl makes it much easier than adjusting pitch 
buttons or spinning some dial or knob on the cd player.

I am curious as to why you're willing to bestow your obviously infinite
wisdom on us backwoods dwelling, rave-killing, PB-CLE mongoloids.
Especially since you're the "#1 Hardcore DJ/producer" in America. Perhaps
its altruism. Please feel free to stuff your pompous attitude wherever it
fits.

Sorry, I don't live in "I killed Rave because I'm too cool and have a
small dick" PB-CLE.

Some people in this country still rave, despite what you may have heard.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} who on the list went to wmc?

actually i drove down last weekend just for saturday
and drove back sunday/monday. it was a good time, i
like long road trips, and we had 3 people driving in
shifts so it wasnt so bad. it took us about 22 hours
both ways. i wasnt gonna go but my friend takuya asked
me to go with him so he didn't have to go by himself,
he was going down to mix video at global gathering. i
mentioned it to my one friend and she offered to
drive. i had nothing else to do, and i never been to
florida before so i said why not, fuggit. i only spent
about $150 of which 60 or 80 was gas, so not too bad,
got comped all around at the party. the party was
great, met some cool ppl, gave out some mixes/tracks,
and saw some awesome talent including jeru the damaja
(i'm a die-hard fan) the beat junkies (who were so
f-ing good of course) argonauts, gunkhole (dilated
didn't show up) dj as if from england (who i met and
she's awesome), dj clever (yes another one) and some
other dope turntablist who's name i failed to catch,
syrup (siren is totally sexy, rippin'it'tupp-ahh!!)
soulslinger, danny the wildchild and andy c. i got
some good pictures of all the acts but they're on the
old-school and i have to develop/scan them. all in all
a great fookin time, next year i'm definitely going
down and coming correct with like 1000 press kits.

atually most of the techno that i make is too melodic
or funky to be considered cracker by the purist. but i
did finish one good cracker track for miami with a
super-cool white-boy breakdown. i make some dubby
techno too, i guess that's not very caucasian either,
or is it? i mean it's mostly germans and belgians
making that right?

Taken from the Drug Policy Alliance:

Drug Czar Schedule Released!

John Walters's Drug Testing Propaganda Tour Schedule Made Public

A Rare Opportunity to Grill the Drug Czar

Drug Czar John Walters is at it again - traveling around the country on =
a taxpayer-funded drug war myths tour - but this time we have his =
schedule!!

Walters and the White House usually keep his schedule a secret until the =
last minute because they fear that drug policy reformers like you will =
challenge his drug war lies. This time around we can plan ahead and =
pressure him to answer the real questions! We know exactly where he will =
talk and what topic he will address - the Bush administration's plans to =
take away parents' rights to decide how best to keep their kids safe. =
Let's say no to student drug testing!!!

Please organize a group to attend the Office of National Drug Control =
Policy Student Drug Testing Regional Summits. These events will attract =
media attention, a great opportunity to get our opposition heard!

** If you don't live near any of the summit locations, please forward =
this message on to family and friends who do!

The dates and locations of the meetings are:

Chicago, IL, March 16, 2004. 9am-5pm
(Radisson Hotel Schaumburg, 1725 Algonquin Road)

Fresno, CA, March 18, 2004. 9am-5pm
(Fresno Convention Center, 848 M Street)

Atlanta, GA, March 25, 2004. 9am-5pm
(Holiday Inn, 450 Capitol Avenue)

Denver, CO, April 8, 2004. 9am-5pm
(Executive Tower Hotel, 1405 Curtis Street)

You can RSVP for the summits at http://www.cmpinc.net/dts/ . We will =
send emails to those of you in the areas where these events will occur =
as we have more details. You can check our online tool kit for ways to =
help end student drug testing.

Student drug testing has been attracting growing attention since =
President Bush pushed for greater use of this drug war policy in schools =
during his State of the Union address. He is even willing to put forward =
$23 million of our taxpayer dollars to help fund this invasive practice.

Student drug testing is controversial for many reasons. The White House, =
in its accelerating encroachment on civil liberties, wants to take away =
parents' rights to protect their own children and take away teachers' =
rights to teach. This is a safety issue, and collecting children's urine =
is a serious concern. What's more, studies even show that student drug =
testing doesn't work to deter drug use. Student drug testing destroys =
the trust between children and adults, and drives students away from the =
choir, debate team, chess club, and other extracurricular activities =
that are proven to help them stay off drugs. Whether you are a parent, a =
student, a teacher, or just a concerned citizen, this insidious invasion =
of our nation's schools is a horrifying example of the White House =
pushing its insane drug war policies on our families.

John Walters is giving us the perfect opportunity to put a stop to =
student drug testing once and for all!! Make your voice heard at these =
events and make a difference. =20

Please forward this email on to anyone you know in Chicago, IL; Fresno, =
CA; Atlanta, GA; and Denver, CO. We'll keep you up-to-date on actions =
against the Office of National Drug Control Policy Student Drug Testing =
Regional Summits in these areas.

lets think of it like this: if you take a riemann sum of a 
function to find the area under its curve, you can increase the 
fidelity of the result by increasing the number of slices you cut 
the function into on the interval youre measuring. what that does 
is give you a set number of approximations that will get you 
really close to the right answer, but will never be exact. if you 
make the number of slices approach infinity, you get the integral, 
which will give you the proper answer as it creates an infinitely 
smoothed out curve over the interval and the exact area as a 
result. so you can think of a CD as approximating the area of the 
waves with a riemann sum and 44.1 kHz slices per second. you can 
think of vinyl as the integral of the same function, smoothed out 
with infinite possible resolution.

well lets be honest here, a cassette or 8 track tape isnt anything 
like a reel to reel master. most studios still use a reel to reel 
at some point in the process because tape does sound better.

i think that refers mainly to bass, actually. and i dont see what 
the advantage to panned bass is.

i agree with you, but ill still argue that id rather hear

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} wmc review & pics - CDs

Neither of the things are what I would call easy to someone
who has never done it. I didn't come from a musical background
and it took me a while (years) to be able to mix well.
I go out in cleveland at least once a week and hear djs who still
don't understand measures and phrases.

 The cdj pitch control is alot touchier than a
turntables quartz timing. When I originally posted I was looking at
the aspect of being a dj and playing vinyl. I love to go to the
record store and dig for gems. Granted there are a few tracks that I
wish I could find on record and have even thought about downloading
and then getting pressed onto vinyl. That was before I found out how
much that costs.
  After much thought, this is what I've come up with. If you
bring records, cd's or a kazoo and washboard, and you fuckin tear it
up, thats what its all about! No matter what genre you play, listen
to, or produce, you are still supporting the scene. It doesn't matter
if you're a "rave" dj, club dj, or even a basement dj, you
do it because you love the music. I respect anyone who has the
dedication to put in the time and work to further the dance music
scene. I apoligize for my one sided opinion from last night. Play
whatever you want, dance like a crazy fool, and if anyone gives you
shit tell'em to fuck off.

im really not sure what youre basing this on. if anything id say 
mixing CDs is harder simply because you cant physically touch them 
at all to correct your mix, you have to use the wheel or the pitch 
control only. anyway, any fucking idiot can mix either CDs or

Playing devil's advocate, the problem is that vinyl doesn't have infinite
resolution.  The accuracy at any one point is much better, especially over
time, with digital.  The accuracy from point-to-point in time is much
better with analog.  You know all that.

What that means in the real world is what seems to be up for grabs,
technical shit aside.  I'd say that if an artist lays down a track
digitally, then distributes the .wav on a CD, it'll sound better than the
vinyl would have.  Since most artists seem to be doing at least some
digital work in the studio, going digital->analog is losing fidelity...

That aside, maybe we just like how analog sounds.

imagine my surprise when i entered work this morning and found out my email address had accidentally

so if anyone emailed me and got a bounceback, that would be why.

what did i miss? anything fun?

Oh, and via wonkette.com - more fun Bush-Cheney 04 campaign poster slogan suggestions:

i think the main problem with vinyl is the actual material you are 
cutting into can only handle grooves with a finite resolution. 
something like 2" reel to reel tape is going to give you some of 
the best possible analogue sound.

digital to analogue doesnt lose anything! if you have proper 
converters, analogue will perfectly reproduce digital quality 
sounds. its going from analogue to digital that you lose 
everything. once its lost (converted to digital) you cant get that 
stuff back. so you have a point, if someone is doing their music 
all digitally then theres absolutely no benefit (but also no loss, 
so it wouldnt sound "better" as you said) in analogue reproduction 
for them. if youre using analogue equipment (me) then as soon as 
you mix it down to .wav youve lost all the niceness that your 
analogue stuff gave you (well not all but most). for me, if i made 
a track and mixed it down to reel to reel and sent that out to get 
pressed on wax, itd sound much much nicer than mixing it down 
to .wav and playing it from a CD. 

>That aside, maybe we just like how analog sounds.

of course we do, its a normal sound wave. digital is just a frame 
by frame approximation. oddly enough, you can think of digital 
like a film: if you slow it down, you can see the breaks between 
frames. if you play it fast enough though, theres not an ultra 
noticeable break but its not natural either.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR:  Get taken off of creditor lists

I got this in an email from salie mae, basically call this number and 
4 main creditors can't sell your information to anyone so you don't 
keep getting all those credit card applications.  You can either stop 
it for 2 years or stop it permanently.  I just did the 2 year one 
figuring I may actually have money by then and can get another card.  
Anyway, here's the number:

888-567-8688

It's all touch tone except for where you have to say and spell your 
name (which seems pointless since they ask for your SS#)

I don't know if this makes sense or not, but some once said "What about =
all the information missing between the 0's and 1's in digital formats"?

Vinyl is warmer sounding, without a doubt. =20

Vinyl reproduces more of the sound spectrum than commercially produced =
cds'.  It is fact that commercial cd's don't reproduce as much bass as =
vinyl.  Both the lower and upper ends of the sound spectrum are =
compressed.

  Playing devil's advocate, the problem is that vinyl doesn't have =
infinite
  resolution.  The accuracy at any one point is much better, especially =
over
  time, with digital.  The accuracy from point-to-point in time is much
  better with analog.  You know all that.

  What that means in the real world is what seems to be up for grabs,
  technical shit aside.  I'd say that if an artist lays down a track
  digitally, then distributes the .wav on a CD, it'll sound better than =
the
  vinyl would have.  Since most artists seem to be doing at least some
  digital work in the studio, going digital->analog is losing =
fidelity...

  That aside, maybe we just like how analog sounds.

I dont know so much that it's the CD itself doesnt have enough 
spectrum, but rather it's whatever Digital to Analog converter 
chip that you have in your cd player that decides to disregard 
frequencies outside of the 20-20,000Hz range.  Afterall, we only 
HEAR sounds above, what, like 27-30Hz.  We FEEL the sounds below 
that range.  And on the top end, i dont think there is much above 
16-18,000 that we actually can discern in a very audible manner, 
except some really high pitches that just are painful to listen to.

Easy question, interesting thought.  12" vinyl was designed as an LP; used
to get about an hour per record, half-hour per side.  12" singles have 10
minutes (tops) per side on the vinyl, which should give you three or four
times the available space to store data... thus, better bass.

I'm wondering if you took a standard, 80 minute CD, and used it to store
10 minutes of music, how noticeable the change would be.  Assuming you
used the extra bits to store all of the truncated bass...

Subject: {pb-cle} Saint Patty's Day

Don't know what kind of St. Patty's Day business you all have planned, but
you might want to consider hitting up the BBT tomorrow night. The
Hi-Frequencies are going to be there playing their Dick Dale inspired
surfer rock stylings. They're good, but the other act is who I am singing
the praises of. A little 3 piece from Polish Hill called Shopping. These
guys seriously tear shit up. All around good stuff - songwriting, playing,
stage presence, and vocals. Its just a couple bucks, and then you can come
swill pints of Guinness with us at Gooski's. Pain Dogs are going to be
there - another quality local act.

Whatever you do, be careful if you're driving. It's alcoholic amateur night.

yeah....but nobody can tell the difference on a shitty pa....or even a
decent pa...they just dont have the response of studio monitors...that being
said...the only place you might be able to tell the difference between clean
vinyl and a cd is on a set of studio monitors.

if u had the digi hd192 converters...and a good summing mixer...bouncing
your analouge stuff to digital wouldnt loose anything

apogee makes dope converters too...but they(like the digi converters)are mad
expensive...but with audio gear...you definately get what you pay for.

Well, obviously the sampling rate would just be higher (from 44.1khz to anywhere from 48 to 96khz,
maybe? i mean, it already exists in dvd-audio...)

But it still wouldn't be a true "lossless" format. You're always going to miss something since
that's what digitizing does.

Whatever is missing between the 0's and 1's on cd's are also missing in 
vinyl.  Do you think everyone still masters to r2r???

Yeah, except I'd bet that DVD-audio still snips the bottom end some.  Most

<<Yeah, except I'd bet that DVD-audio still snips the bottom end some.  Most people wouldn't try to

That's exactly waht I was getting at with the "lossless" comment...digital is ALWAYS going to lose
something when compared against the best of analog.

That's the big tradeoff:

Digital - lose some amount of 'true fidelity', but gain the ability to accurately reproduce the same
sounds infinitely since the "moving parts" don't degrade the storage media...PLUS - currently cheap
and easy to reproduce.

Analog - retain that fidelity in the best of media, but over time, the repeated use of that media
degrades the fidelity of the reproduction since there's friction involved in the reproduction
(repeated playings) of that product...PLUS not cheap and easy to reproduce. To "get the good stuff"
requires an extensive setup or costing large sums of money to have quality reproduction to retain
fidelity.

I'm not making the argument for or against, I'm just pointing out the differences here. As I've said
before...

It don' matter to me if you're usin' 2 spoons, a washtub, and a Casiotone...just play me some good
funky music, motherfucker.

well, you would do that by increasing the sample/rate of the track therefore 
taking up more space on the CD - but that's as data, not CD Audio.  Another 
way to get more data out of a CD is by increasing the frequency of the laser 
reading the CD - this is actually not that far off in the future - the 
introduction of blue lasers in the everyday CD player.  I'm not sure how 
much more data this will make possible on a standard size CD (or if there 
will be a need for a new type of CD itself), but i think it's capacity 
becomes several times the current amount - not sure on it though

Hope to see everyone out tonight.
Peace,

Mandie and I are coming down around 8pm. Napoleon, was there something about
passes or something? if so could you reserve some for Mandie and I and 2
friends? I am even willing to pay for them if need be in order to get in on
the free drinks. Now what exactly is free? top shelf? If so I plan on trying
to drink as much Grey Goose as possible without getting sick.. hopefully
enough to keep a buzz through Dougs set.. Just kidding. (Love you Doug) Hey

Even better, try drinking tall pauls as much as possible without getting sick.  
I tried, got sick, went downhill from there :)

Not sure what those passes are for, but I think there's a few people that will 
be there with a ton of them, just have to ask around.

I'll be there.  I'll have some olive color cargo pants and my 1337 anime shirt 
(you'll know it when you see it) and probably my "o" hat, maybe the backs 
one, not sure.  And, umm, lets just say if I do bring some certain items, 
you'll be able to spot me :)

in real studios quite a bit of stuff is kept in the analogue 
domain. and if you record at 24 bit ro whatever and mixdown to 
analogue the quality will still be higher than CD quality.

sidetrakkt productions presents:

PSYNERGY

Saturday, March 13, 2004
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

psychedelic sonic manipulation generated by:

AMERICAN PSYCHEDELIC and EG-BOT (performing LIVE)
(Am-Psy - Philadelphia)

American Psychedelic and Eg-Bot are joining forces for a double live
performance!

Psytrance for the next generation. Progressive song style trance with
searing leads, mind bending breakdowns and a hint of Goa loops. From the
darkness of night to the brilliant sounds of morning. As well as the
musician behind American Psychedelic, Edward Gaittins III is also
responsible for the series of Am-Psy intimate psytrance parties in
Philadelphia. We are excited to welcome American Psychedelic as he makes
his Pittsburgh debut!

David McGee (aka Eg-Bot) is crazy. Bugs eating bugs will grace the screens
of stacked TVs on either side of the kiosk. This is all part of his
apocalyptic vision for his upcoming full length CD 'Bug Mutation.' Eg-bot
offers a wealth of inspiration with a touch of dark humor to his works.
Always on the cutting edge of music, he has been hard at work blending
minimal psytrance with textured sound-scapes, samples and hooks that just
can't be denied. His tracks are a twisting journey through psychedelia.

www.am-psy.com

ALLEN
(Gaian Mind - Metropolis Records - Philadelphia)

The driving force behind Gaian Mind, Allen is responsible for some of the
east coast's largest psytrance festivals. One of the U.S.'s top psytrance
dj's, and one of our personal favorites, Allen has ignited dance floors
for many years with his twisted, mind-warping, psychedelic sets. We are
honored to welcome back Allen as he returns to Pittsburgh.

GAITTINS
(Am-Psy - Philadelphia)

As well as playing live, Ed will also deliver an additional dj set.

DJ MEGHAN
(Goahead - WCPF - Cleveland, Ohio)

Dark and tribal psytrance from one of Goahead's finest.

thats just not true. analogue mediums are different, obviously 
vinyl has more physical limitations than high quality tape but its 
still able to carry more upper harmonics and whatnot than digital 
can.

Digital

dude, its impossible. the entire principle of digital is that you 
take increasingly more and more samples of sound the higher the 
digital quality gets. its never a continuous waveform, which is 
what analogue is. digital can on principle NEVER sound "better" 
or "surpass" analogue. its juts impossible.

thats going to sound bad. you know what time stretching sounds 
like. it sounds bad because it increases the space inbetween the 
samples in a sound. that will never change. i guess at some point 
digital technology can reach such a high sampling frequency that 
time stretching might sound less annoying, but it will always 
sound bad.

you ALWAYS lose something when digitizing. you can minimize it by 
increasing the sampling rate, but something is always lost. 
honestly, the only way to not lose something is if the sampling 
rate is infinite, which digitally is impossible. using analogue is 
the only way to do it. analogue is the only lossless way of 
recording audio. im not talking about what is audible, im talking 
hard fact.

its really as simple as understanding what happens when you record 
music. shit, i purposely bitreduce my drum sounds to 12 or even 8 
bit sometimes, and also downsample from CD quality samples to get 
gritty efx and weird harmonic distortion. all im trying to point 
out is that people who think digital recording can ever contain as 
much detail as analogue have no fucking clue what theyre talking 
about. its a pretty simple concept if you just think about it, but 
it eludes alot of people apparently.

if by "sounds better" you mean "is more convenient to carry and

Sure thing, Tom.  Next time you're out, try to pick up the flyest honey at

Vinyl looks cooler and its all about image, rave dj.

Godamned audio nerds getting in the way of my raving. You won't keep ME down 
Tom.  Not only will I listen to better quality music coming out of a cd 
jukebox robot, but they're just plain smarter.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Spare us the food jokes.

transparent tennis visor and having the most amazing conversations with the 
flyest honeys at the jams.

Ahh, I was waiting for the dubious tom-entropy alliance to end.  Ego 
always gets in the way.

Entropy, do us a favor and just leave our list.. You really don't add 
any value by insulting us and telling our superstar deejays that they're 
worthless. Oh wait, it is kind of funny sometimes :)

Where was "my" Abbasso vibe???
WTF. People maybe got too drunk on the free booze, if you could get a drink. Sorry everyone I had a bartender walk out mid-shift ( right when we were packed) so I know it got backed up. But a BIG thank you to everyone that made it out, lots of fun drunkenness,  big hugs, and sad faces. The support means a lot to me!!!
 
So since I have to finish out my two weeks we have ONE more Saturday to show me the Abbasso love that I'm looking for. I know it's Funky Charms and Stacy is at Moda(and sad to say I highly recommend this show) but don't forget to stop in and check out Daniel Mnookin and Kyle Szmurlo. These guys rock the funky tech-house, and are super nice guys to save me the flight $ by driving in from Chicago. So out of respect PLEASE at least try to stop by and say hi.
 Trout this means you!!!!!!! Maybe I'll pick up some celebratory PBR, or wait I have a shit load of those Jack Daniels and cola drinks, anyone down???

i will not mention the PBR bet? nevermind, i will mention it.
10 bottles of PBR by 2:30 and i get the remainder of 2 ultra classy 
cases of PBR in bottles.  (naps wanted 12, but i had a couple pints and 
some wings)
i was thinking 10, but was gonna be rough after the wings (vomit ammo in 
case it goes horribly wrong).  hahaha naps you didn't know that!  anyhow 
i drank em like a champ and had to run from the very polite but doing 
his job barback while i chug #10 at 2:30 .....    

 
anyhow, i would like to totally mention the fact that free beer should 
be a constituional amendment.  forget this flag burning gay marriage 
shit.  people will be happier because they are drunk and have beer 
goggle.  damn.  i am on the motherfucker of (non-drug) rolls this 
morning, ask andy james.  paul fleetwood aint got shit on me.  add my 
free beer amendment to the right to bear arms.  i smell a serious 
blockbuster movie.  holy wood needs me to save them.  oh fuck.  free 
beer + automatic weopns + captain fruitake's holy rod.   damn.  it cant 
fucking miss.  pbcle is invited to the opeing, except captatin 
fruitcake. fuck it, i'll do it strongbadia goose style and make him the 
guest of honor.  the CIA can chaufer him. 

okay fuck, i need to sleep but i got some seriously fucked up (and 
rather fun) insomnia going on. damn. ignore me, after one more back on 
topic bit.

hmmm, i put some thought into poppin over moda for end of that 
non-cracker techno guy, and the beginning of that quasi-cracker techno 
guys set.   dunno.   it really really sucks the conflicts.  i had some 
oddball ideas maybe the other night.  discounts at moda with FC5 
tickets/bracelets. and vice versa.  dunno how well it would work but 
pretty last minute. FC5 is going a little later after moda. so is 
abbasso.  afterhours after FC5 nearby.  don't know a whole lot about it 
or whos doing it.
too late for this but a FC5/abbasso/moda ticket or wrist band. tho feel 
moda would not like my pretty much in/out policy.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} vinyl vs cd

True but almost nothing that gets pressed to vinyl these days is done in 
a "real studio".   Most of it never leaves the digital realm untill the 
glass master is made.  If did have a r2r handy, I would mix down to it 
purely for effect.  Tape compression rules.  I like vinyl for the 
oposite reason, I like the sound of a grungy old record.  I think the 
noises that scratches and dust make create the illusion of motion.  Most 
of the amens in my tunes come from my personal copy of the original 45 
of Amen Brother and it sounds differnt from everyone elses because my 
record is worn in differnt places than everyone elses.  You collectors 
would prolly get ill if you saw my half of my collection randomly placed 
around my tables without thier sleaves.  I think the only one worse than 
me with that shit is Nick S lol.

i guess it depends on what youre listening to. even in electronic 
music theres lot of people who use strictly analogue (basic 
channel immediately jump to mind. i know some hiphop cats still 
rock r2rs as well). 

>If did have a r2r handy, I would mix down to it 
>purely for effect.  Tape compression rules. 

actually im trying to get a 2 track r2r just for that purpose. 
then id record out of the r2r to soundforge for doing edits and 
buring to CDR.

i definitely agree, though i hate it when shit gets needlessly 
scuffed up. i do like the sound of old pops and crackles on my old 
records though.

i used to have 3 copies of that 45, now i only have 2 after i 
traded one to ratana.

theres no excuse for that nonsense. and youve never seen selekta 
deejay im sure. some of his shit is unplayable because its so beat 
up from never being in sleeves. its sad. i try to keep my records 
as good as they can be without being overly anal about it.

Due to venue conflicts we lost two of our stages for the Saturday Funky 
Charms event.  We now have implemented three additional stages for the 
Friday party.  Friday's event will now go until 9am!  The first half of 
the party will be hosted at club Karma in the Powerhouse.  The second 
half will be showcased at Metropolis.  Friday wristbands will be honored 
at Metropolis.  Everything is still 18 and up.  Metropolis is within 
walking distance of Club Karma on the West Bank downtown.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Abbasso tonight - Roll call?

Yeah, there was definitely something missing there.  I'm thinking it 
was all the people that were probably at the bar upstairs and then 
heard that it's free alcohol down there, got drunk till 10:00, then 
got out of there, damn parasites.  Although all those shady people 
did end up leaving by 11:00 though, so it was back to just the 
typical crowd then.  I didn't stick around that long 'cause I wasn't 
feeling that good, probably because I didn't eat anything, and the 
food upstairs just slightly helped.

I still have no idea where I'm going next weekend.  I'll probably 
skip out on friday FC just because I get tired eaiser on friday 
nights from working all day.  And then I can get some extra sleep for 
saturday since i work then till 6:00.  but at least I won't be late 
wherever I decide to go.  I'll probably go to FC since TRAAAAT is 
spinning, and spinning cracker techno on top of that :)

These guys rock the funky tech-house, and are super nice guys to save me the flight $ by driving in from Chicago. So out of respect PLEASE at least try to stop by and say hi.

Well I'm sure both of you were stealing the flyest honeys at the jams!

Because I have now learned that they don't go for intelligence, they go for 
bright yellow shirts.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Who goes to a rave for "intelligence"?  LOL

What would that even look like?

You are making it extreamly obvious YOU don't go anywhere "for" intelligence. I have met some of the most intelligent people I know at "raves". Don't get me wrong, I am sure there are stupid people there also, I try and avoid them. Hey maybe that's why I've never met you.  Moron

I'm not sure I've met too many intelligent people at a rave since at least 
1997 or so.  For intelligent people these days, I hang out with the local 
LP'ers Free Stater's.  (lp.org, freeststeproject.org)

Last night was...well different.  Free drinks was mighty nice, was kind of glad some of the yuppities left after they got their booze, and we could enjoy q burns--who had a really interesting set. 
 
Todd, I officially dub thee Sir God of Glowsticks....you are hilarious. Some people pack heat, you pack glow. lol.  Thanks for lighting up the bar. : )
 
Well out to Moda to see Glaude later tonight, and perhaps Karma to visit Doug B. for a bit (I hope)  Hopefully, we'll see some of you all at the last official Abbasso bash next Sat. for Dan Mnookin.  Hey  we're doing double duty FC5 and Abbasso---you guys can too. : )
 
Dan is such a cool guy, he really deserves to get some ears hearing his tracks, and *sniff* sniff* it's the last afterhours with Naps.

Yeah, there was definitely something missing there. I'm thinking it 
was all the people that were probably at the bar upstairs and then 
heard that it's free alcohol down there, got drunk till 10:00, then 
got out of there, damn parasites. Although all those shady people 
did end up leaving by 11:00 though, so it was back to just the 
typical crowd then. I didn't stick around that long 'cause I wasn't 
feeling that good, probably because I didn't eat anything, and the 
food upstairs just slightly helped.

I still have no idea where I'm going next weekend. I'll probably 
skip out on friday FC just because I get tired eaiser on friday 
nights from working all day. And then I can get some extra sleep for 
saturday since i work then till 6:00. but at least I won't be late 
wherever I decide to go. I'll probably go to FC since TRAAAAT is 
spinning, and spinning cracker techno on top of that :)

These guys rock the funky tech-house, and are super nice guys to save me the flight $ by driving in from Chicago. So out of respect PLEASE at least try to stop by and say hi.

I'm probably heading out to moda, it's kinda fun watching all the 
"clubbers" there staring at me because I'm usually in a corner, 
looking pissed off (that's my 'relaxed' face, most people say I 
either looked pissed off or really sad :) )

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} vinyl vs cd

Hehe yeah, there have been several classics that I have distroyed that 
way.  The worst part is, I have bought replacements for several that 
where ruined and then left THEM out of there sleaves.  However, it did 
made make me feel beter about myself when Nick S showed up at my crib 
with a backpack full of his newest 50 records with no sleaves in sight.  
My records are at least in close proximity of the sleaves and they NEVER 
leave my house without them... and don't worry my Winstons record is 
vaulted.  My other most prized record Vanilla Ice - Hoodey Mack test 
pressing is sleavless at the moment though.

Subject: {pb-cle} Friday, April 2 | RYAN PAPA (stigma recordings, australia)

FRIDAY, APRIL 2

RYAN PAPA (stigma recordings, resident advisor, australia)

Ryan's unique sound, fueled by smooth mixing and stylistic versatility,
ensures he is frequently playing at a wide variety of events across the
globe. He's house, he's breaks, he's progressive, he's tech. Whatever he
is, he's PHENOMENAL!

Recently Ryan delivered his distinct brand of music with a highly
successful trip to Malaysia to headline "The Backroom" in Kualu Lumpur
as well as a trip with studio partner Jeff Drake to headline the House
Broken party in Tokyo, Japan. 

Further to his hectic schedule, Ryan also finds time to take his sound
interstate in his homeland of Australia, with a number of past
performances in Melbourne at Altitude nightclub as well as supporting
Cass at the Sabotage party in Sydney. Ryan can also lay claim to being
one of few Australian DJs to perform on the highly regarded national
radio show 'Mixup' on JJJ alongside Darren Emerson.

In's Ryan's own words, we're "...really hanging to get on with this gig
in Cleveland, mate!!!! It's going to be mental!!!"

yes you are right...but 99% of the populance still cant tell the difference
is something was recorded on an otari 2"...or a protools system.

Subject: {pb-cle} Beat Matrix 03.15.2004 | wruw fm 91.1 | 10:30 pm

The Headrush Music duo will be the featured guest on Monday's show. 
Deviant will be providing the tunes and hopefully we will hear some 
selections from Headrush's new Cleveland-based label - Toes in the 
Sand.  If that wasn't enough! They are fresh from the Winter Music 
Conference and I am sure have stories to share...About the WMC and 
their new nights (yes nights) at Metropolis.

Headrush Music can be found on-line at http://www.headrushmusic.com

If you are near Cleveland, please tune your radio dial to WRUW 91.1 
FM on Monday from 10:30pm until 12:30am or point your browser to 
http://www.wruw.org to catch the stream.

After the show surf to http://www.beatmatrix.net for a set list and 
April's line-up.

Thank you for your support - and let us know how we can support you.

Due to venue conflicts we lost two of our stages for the Saturday Funky 
Charms event.  We now have implemented three additional stages for the 
Friday party.  Friday's event will now go until 9am!  The first half of 
the party will be hosted at club Karma in the Powerhouse.  The second 
half will be showcased at Metropolis.  Friday wristbands will be honored

at Metropolis.  Everything is still 18 and up.  Metropolis is within 
walking distance of Club Karma on the West Bank downtown.
 
TO VIEW THE REVISED TIMESLOTS PLEASE VISIT: 
http://www.euphorixprofunk.com/fc5/timeslots.htm
 
If you now have a scheduling conflict due to the changes, please let us 
know!  We will do our best to accomodate your requests.
please e-mail bookings@euphorixprofunk.com 
<mailto:bookings@euphorixprofunk.com>
 
Going into the week before the event it will be difficult to drastically

move things around so please respond immediately if you have such
requests.
 
We apologize for any inconvenience as this was out of our control.

A run with updated VirusScan on the computer at my parent's house 
brings up some Adware and .cab files.  I successfully got rid of 
the adware, but I can't get rid of the damn .cab files.  I tried 
deleting in safe mode, etc. and I still get that I'm unable to 
delete them.

Any suggestions?

Thanks, 
Justin

Unplug your computer and drop it from a 6th story window. That should solve
the problem.

Granted- I know nothing of computers.

Caldwell's colorfully versatile music career began in the winter of 1992. Fueled by an innate talent for the art of music, he quickly took deejaying to the next level as a producer, easily overcoming one of the toughest obstacles of the trade: translating an emotion to melodic reality. Since then, Caldwell has released more than 30 records, several albums and an array of mix compilations.

Caldwell's first track "Superfunkidiculous" was released in 1994 and quickly became a top hit throughout the club scene, leading to a collaboration project with childhood friend Gabriel Rene. Forming the highly acclaimed San Francisco band "Soulstice", Caldwell and Renee produced and wrote music for the release of the band's album "Illusion" and the renowned remix album, "Mixed Illusions." During that time, Caldwell also created a steady stream of his own celebrated releases for OM Records including three stand-alone, single releases, as well as releases featured on Mark Farina's widely popular Mushroom Jazz series. His singles were also included on six consecutive Om Lounge compilations and two full-length mix CDs entitled Sounds of Om v. 2. Caldwell's now seminal Om Records' release, "I Can't Wait" has appeared on Ben Watts Lazy Dog v. 2 compilation and on Miguel Migs' mix compilation Nude Tempo.

Other top singles for Caldwell include his popular Naked Music release "All I Need", and "Don't Hold Back" featured on Inspirit Music's InSoul Sessions v. 1, an album that he also mixed. He has recently collaborated with DJ/producer Behrouz on their single "Be Free" and a remix of the Grammy nominated track "Safe From Harm" for Deep Dish's label, Yoshitoshi.

Tell them to stop looking @ porn sites and clicking on things.

You might wanna try spybot also. Its available from download.com too. Adaware and spybot combined seem to get rid of most things other than viruses.

Cab files are a form of microsoft archive file, can you be more

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} nrr: PC help


I've had to do this manually several times because sometimes ad-aware and 
other spyremoval programs don't get everything.  It's a hack method and 
takes a bit of knowledge and searching to know what should be there and what 
shouldn't but here ya go:

Open the registry and goto: (Start -> Run -> regedit)

HKLM . Software . Microsoft . Windows . CurrentVersion . Run & RunOnce

HKCU . Software . Microsoft . Windows . CurrentVersion . Run & RunOnce

Check each of the entries - a simple google search can tell you what should 
be there and what shouldn't.  There really shouldn't be many here, but alot 
of spyware hides here.  When you decide if it's spyware or not, find the 
file on the comp and delete it or change its name, along with deleting the 
entry in the registry. (You might want to rename it first (add an "_" before 
the filename) to besure it's something needing deletion so it's not lost 
altogether if it ends up being something important)

If they have kazaa / gator or other programs of the like, get rid of them, 
it's constantly updating itself and installing its spyware programs that run 
in the backround.  The only one that doesn't is SoulSeek, unless you fell 
victim and installed the *fake* version of it.  I'm not sure what the fake 
version does, all i know is that it doesn't work.

Also, check each of the processes in the task manager (again a google search 
will turn up what it is).  The amount here varies, but look for anything odd 
(if they have XP look for ones running under their computer / user name  
they're more likely to be something odd.

AOL has started putting adware into AIM and AOL, remove a program called 
"WildTangent" from Add/Remove Programs as well.  I do not think ad-aware or 
spybot will pick this up yet... perhaps in the next versions. being from AOL 
and not some hack company, its probably better written and doesn't clog up 
many system resources like so many other adware & spy programs do, But it's 
still just as vicious and intrusive and sends a hell of a lot of information 
to AOL. (A personal firewall could take help take care of that though).

As for the cab files,, they're MS version of "Zip" files - also used in 
ActiveX programs and other loaded programs - mainly associated with IE.  
Check the ones in Internet Options - > Settings - > View Objects, would be 
another place to look for weird files.

It's not the end all solution, but it's a start to cleaning up the comp and 
should help stop the chance of these spyprograms replicating themselves 
(which many do).

make sure you get spybot S&D (search and destroy). there are some ripoff

your computer, but wont remove shit unless you pay for the upgrade version.

http://www.safer-networking.org/ is the official site.  i like this 
better than ad-aware, but use both just to be sure.
should be legal to shoot on sight these fuckers that write this stuff,

Thanks, Trout. 

Just a reminder to all that the arrangements being made are with regard to improving the event and that we are contacting the performers today and should have everything 100% confirmed by Thursday. The timeslots that are listed are only tentative and are posted so that we can make last minute changes, if desired. 

 

Everything's looking great and we hope everyone's looking forward to this as much as we are!!!

also be sure to check in the win.ini file, some drop entries in there.  
theres a few really obscure places that they can end up at beyond those, 
i forget where though.   theres a program at http://www.mlin.net/ called 
startup control panel, it lets you edit startups in 5 different places.  
just uncheck the ones you don't want to run, or delete em

i have the holy grail of C64/SID toys.....
i have a sequential circuits midi interface and some other one forget 
the name......

theres this program that will take midi data and play notes, pretty much 
making the C64 a synthesizer.
never got the program working right, did find another one recently but 
have my C64s packed away right now.

It's a little known fact that Zombie Nation did Kernkraft 400 entirely 
on two sidstations (the audio chip inside the C64). These things are 
beasts, especially with a little reverb and some filters.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} nrr: PC help

If you're running Windows Me or XP, and have System Restore enabled, there's
a chance that the infected files actually got backed up by Windows. In order
to get rid of those files (they're protected, and anti-virus software won't
be able to delete them on its own), you have to first disable System Restore
(right-click "My Computer" on the desktop, choose "Properties," then check
the "Turn off System Restore on all drives" box located on the "System
Restore" tab), reboot, run the virus scan again, then re-enable System
Restore once you've gotten rid of the infected files.

Here's a link to more detailed instructions, and a Microsoft Knowledge Base
article as well... http://www.pchell.com/virus/systemrestore.shtml

Hope that helps...

Subject: {pb-cle} Psynergy/A couple reviews

Props to Dan and the Sidetrakkt family
for hookin up a proper Psytrance gathering.
The music was all fresh. I don't know what
they are doin in Philly, but that's were
all the fat shit is commin from right now
with the whole Soular Record and Am-Psy
steez via Onommon, Eg-bot, and American
Psychedelic. That is truly cutting edge
material. Thanks for bringing that whole
culture to the pb-cle. I can't wait for
your boy Psyphon to come kill it for us
At 3i 4.

Peace,
Luke

great review luke, and thanks for the compliments.  anyone who can make it to
luke's 3rd eye party should.  the dj talent is stacked and luke throws a mean
party.  had a killer time at the 2 i've been to, and you can bet we'll be at
the reunion this month.  can't wait!!

so here's my take on psynergy, if ya care:

dan fucking rocks.  he's why i know psytrance, and he's why pittsburgh knows
psytrance.  this music and culture has in no shy terms changed my life.  he's
such an amazing energy!!  so dan, thanks for absolutely everything and 
thanks
for another amazing party!!

the deco was tight.  best we've ever made the shadow lounge look.  the
hand-painted banners were heavenly, and thanks so much for painting them and
bringing them!!  BOM!

so i was lucky enough to start the show.  i've been practicing diligently.
dedicated.  ready.  and i dropped the ball.  dern it.  phucked it all up. 
had
nick binary from boston, allen from philly, am psy and egbot, luke, alberto,
dan, brad, (i think pooja was spared(sp) from this set??) and each and every
dancer brimmed with that readiness that gets us all right before these things
start..........and i tripped up on unfamiliar gear (and with no monitor at
the
start).  sorry guys. poor reason i know, but true.  i'm not at all practiced
with getting the music in the headphones like the djm-600 sends it to you,
as i
get the channels/master split to the headphones by the 300.   thought i could
pull it off but maybe shoulda brung my own dex. who knows?  maybe not.  track
selection was good.....mixing was horrid.  a few tight mixes here and there,
but horrid.  luke was kind in his review....thanks bro.

then meghan took the stage, kind enough to accept my request to start 15 mins
early as i wanted to batter the dance floor no more.  wow, is meghan good.
i've never seen meghan play live before.  all cd set @ psynergy, every mix
spot
on.  track selection was perfect.  she had many people up dancing, and they
were gettin' down!  super job meghan, very well done!!  thanks!!!

meghan played perfect a lead into allen.  as well as meghan played and
readied the dancers, can one really prep a floor for allen??  he's
amazing.  you
have no idea the madness allen's to put you thru regardless how many times
you've
seen him before until he grabs the reigns of your unsanity and (un)kindly
reorganizes your reality.  each track just absolutely full of psychedelic
chunkiness.   you find yourself dancing frenzied scrambling the 2 or 3
functioning
neurons ya got left.  thanks for  a fun dance allen, and like luke i'm always
anxious for the next.

i had only heard about 4 songs on a promo of am-psy, and had never heard
anything by egbot (unless he was on the promo with am-pys), so i wasn't
really
quite sure what the 2 of 'em had in store for us.  man, these boys came
stompin'.
 straight ready to get down....and they did!!  they fucking rocked the house.
 had even the people sitting down get up to the floor.  whatta fun live set,
these 2 danced all over.  the facial expressions were priceless.  i was
amazed
at how am-psy knew where the buttons that were in the air, invisible to the
dancers to make the fun sounds come out of the speakers.  ;-)   such fun. 
such
love for the music.  true musicians.  true live psychedelic
entertainment......thanks tons for that set fellas!!!!!

then ed closed with an excellent dj set.  just like his live act, tracks that
are perfect for the call.  an awesome deck wizard, he had 'em dancing till
the lights came on.  a perfect close to a perfectly organized party.

thanks again to dan for making this stuff happen flawlessly, brilliantly
allowing the music to live in pittsburgh.  and thanks to you all for
fitting so
flawlessly and billiantly into his dirty lil plan.

Love & Life,
.;.Sweet.;.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Psynergy - P2cIburgh - Sidetrakkt

I had been looking forward to this
one for a long time and as usual
Dan, Terry, Brad, Pooja, Dustin and
the Sidetrakkt crew always go out
of thier way to create a proper
trance gathering. Werd.

Arrived with Cleveland crew, Meghan,
Sid, Marisa and Eric after a
wonderful tRip into the burg. There
is nothing quite so fairy tale looking
as P2cIburg. Very Memorable and a good
appetizer for the tasty beatz I was about
to fill up on. More Ohio Goahead's arrived
throughout the evening for a very good
representation. Also always good to see
the Cosmic Traveler, Alberto, cuz the party
really doesn't start till he get's there
and on the floor. Werd.

Flouro deco on point. I'm not gonna try
to put that into werds tho, it wouldn't
do it justice, Plus I don't think there are
names for some of the images that came
to mind that evening/morning.

Music:

Sweet Chaos - Terry got things started with
the serious tribal vibe just the way I like
it. The perfect setup. Sweet Chaos has
become a wonderful Trance Shaman. We are lucky
to have him in the Pittsburgh - Cleveland
region. Terry, Brad and I toasted to
Matthias at the beginning of your set.
We kicked it for him that night. Werd.

Dj Meghan - That's mah girl.. she administered
tough luv, gettin techy with it, hittin at about
143-144, ending up with some fullon sounds. She
had everyone's attention. At the risk of sounding
to biased, I'll stop there and let someone
else hook that review. Werd.

Allen - First off..dude thanx for the fruit. Good lookin
out. If you have never had some of that tasty Gaian Mind
fruit, you haven't lived yet. Oversized bannana's
and a frozen orange really puts things back into
the proper perspective. It is always an honor to
be up in the same haus as The Gaian Mind himself.
Allen took the decks after Meghan, and it was time
to take the mind for a walk through uncharted
territory. Allen is the master at making the
connection between dj and dancer,if you are looking
to take that ride . His trax are the substance used
to rid your brain of all the stupid shit you learned
back in the day. Very cleansing indeed. FuKcwhatya heard!
The main fullon course was being served and chased
down with a natty lite. Yeah..that's right a
natty lite. I look fwd to the next Allen set! I am
a more educated man. Werd.

American Psychedelic v Egbot - Cool peeps. Good
to meetu. Man..what's up in Philly??? Forreal,
all the fatty shit is commin out of that camp.
First time I got dosed with that noise and keep
that flowin for shure. I was feelin the whole
Philly vibe. To break it down..it was,

1. American - put that shit on American bandstand!
2. Psychedelic - Made Timothy Leary blush
3. Eg-bot - The new PSYOMLETTE...but u won't find
   that at Denny's kidz.

Thier music hit your body the way Allen's hit your
mind. Good serving of high hats, guitars, killa
baselines and the undeniable sound of live live
live music. The Goaheads will def be in touch with
u cats. Werd.

Dan and Sidetrakkt crew, thanks for another great
gathering and setting the tone for the spring,
summer vibe. This journey is just getting started.
See u and crew at Third Eye v.4. Can't wait to
get down to some Psyphon! Thanks for all you
do for this area! Werd.

Bom,

chemlab is going away within 2 weeks.....   so you might want to 
download any of these mp3s from old parties.

also the archives are down until i figure out where to relocate em and 
rework some stuff.

thanks to chemlab for all the years of free hosting of the archives and 
my mp3s and other odds and ends.

Just finished reading the emails (been busy with work), and I 
think you hit it on the nail with this one.  I should have 
mentioned that these .cab files are located in c:\_restore.  I'll 
try this and I'm fairly sure that this is my answer.

Thanks to Adam for a lot of information as well, I knew about half 
of it, and the damn shit came from Kazaa originally (my sister 
tried to install it).  I'm good at catching and uninstalling 
everything for the most part, so these files that were backed up 
is the only problem I couldn't handle.

Thanks,
Justin

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Holy Shit!!!!  Titan Missile Complex (correct link)

Neal Stephenson often writes about literal "underground" cultures in his
scifi. Snow Crash in particular is a book based on the concept of a
metavirus, a virus that infects the mind as well as the body. There's a
chapter about this huge underground complex that is a breeding ground for
this virus.

In his book "The Diamond Age" the father of the main character spends
something like 10 years in an underwater facility that's nearly dark except
for some sort of bioluminecent (sp?) lighting. All they do is take drugs,
have lots of sex and bang drums all the damn time. Sounds like something the
psytrance kids might be into. He eventually leaves the complex, not having
any idea how long he spent in there, rip van winkle stylee with a giant
beard to prove it, and his then young daughter is now a teenager.

Check em out if you like that idea.

Data protocol could leave DSL in the dust

RALEIGH, N.C., -- U.S. researchers have come up with a new
way to transfer information over the Internet that they say
is 6,000 times faster than current high-speed connections.
The so-called Binary Increase Congestion Transmission
Control Protocol, or BIC-TCP, topped a recent test for
stability, scalability and fairness, said the North
Carolina State University computer science researchers who
developed the protocol. Data transfer protocols are pre-
determined standards that determine how information is
transferred between computers, often via the Internet. A
faster protocol like BIC-TCP would speed music and video
downloads for consumers. In addition, it could help
national and international computing labs involved in
large-scale scientific studies, whose rapid transmission
of high volumes of scientific data can congest even the
newest high-speed networks. The researchers say BIC is
much faster than TCP, the current standard in data trans-
fer, which was designed in the 1980s for slower Internet
speeds and narrower bandwidths. The new protocol seeks the
fastest way to move information with the least data lost.
"What takes TCP two hours to determine, BIC can do in one
second," lead author Injobg Rhee said. The protocol could
be commonly available in the next few years.

TCP was designed in the 1980's, but has had some pretty major overhauls 
since then.  The latest is TCP-Reno, which is being updated to TCP-Vegas 
soon-ish...

BIC looks like another proposed set of changes to pre-existing TCP; 
basically, a better way for backbone switches to allocate traffic.

Then again, I could be really wrong.  :)

good job guys keep crying i have a hankie if u need

yea sure whateva i saw wayoutwest last week at the winter music conference @ 
crowbar and they were all standing around with there pretty little laptops and 
ablton and like who gives a fuk to see someone standing round nodding there 
heads and clicking a mouse.

yeah i know, watching someone stand behind 2 records playing is 
the fucking pinnacle of excitement. well, except of course for the 
excitement of someone standing behind pre-sequenced synths. oh 
wait, isnt a sequencer a computer? up oh, your argument make no 
sense.

Throwing it and attending it --

That is kind of a hilarious statement, because I remember finding out one
by one, that practically everyone I knew in an acquaintance capacity
was a meth head.  It was really disillusioning.  Then I started to
understand that what made a lot of raves dope was the fact that EVERYONE
WAS ON E, hence a big dancefloor and people dancing.

I agree that staring at someone using Ableton is boring, but so is watching a dj.   If you have no respect for computer music, but think that vinyl = art, you need to re-evaluate your logic.

Subject: {pb-cle} st. patty's day party tonight

Mike Love, Zachariah and crew are throwing a St. Patrick's day party tonight 
at annabell's.  Cheap ass drinks and good music, sounds like a plan to me.  
Good thing all I have to do is hop on a plane tomorrow, I feel one hell of a 
hangover brewing.  Hope everyone has a good time at Funky Charms.  I wish I 
could be there, it's one of my favorite events of the year.

Matt

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DSL/Cable modems are slow

*drool*

Shit, I just got roadrunner the other day, I thought that was nice.  I'm
going probably about 5 - 10 times faster than the DSL I had before.  Got the

skeet 
v.
To eject or discharge abruptly, especially to discharge (semen) in 
orgasm. 

Extra credit...

If you knew the reference could be traced all the way back to 2 
Live Crew's 1996 lyrics in "C'mon Babe": "Just f*ck me good until 
I skeet".

OK, I am openly admitting to my status as a Cracker Ass Cracker.

Having said that, please tell me what the hell "Skeet" means. It's got to
be somewhat funny considering how Chapelle was going off about it.

Wake up to the trance dance experience! (www.touchsamadhi.com)

Ancient places of power where our ancestors gathered to conduct sacred
ceremonies, celebrating their connection to the earth, sky and to each
other. These sites provided the focus for the community ritual where we
danced all night around huge fires to celebrate the seasons and empower
ourselves as one tribe united in spirit. As we danced on the earth the
power of these sites was released into our bodies, giving us strength and
connecting us to Gaia. Then the religions of fear took hold. They
destroyed our sacred sites and our rituals, burning all who dared to
question. But the power could not be suppressed forever and the great
cycles of time have brought us full circle to this new moment and we
gather once again. The ancient memory has been reawakened, the all night
dance ritual has returned. We are once again experiencing the mystical
power of the Trance

http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=skeet

skeet
v.
To eject or discharge abruptly, especially to discharge (semen) in
orgasm.

Extra credit...

If you knew the reference could be traced all the way back to 2
Live Crew's 1996 lyrics in "C'mon Babe": "Just f*ck me good until
I skeet".

I will also DARE (hey fuk all yall in advance =]     to say that all you 
little pussys using 
Photoshop and the like, suck the digital edge hard.  I have more respect for 
a conventional airbrush artist or fine oil painter anyday.  get a life and 
learn the real deal.  hell go to an art school if u dare.  Yea its so much easier 
to turn on that pile of nuts and bolts of a computer you have and wiz bang a 
"piece of digital art" together.  who cares.
I use Photoshop everyday.  I use a soft synth everyday also.  but this shit 
is gettin out of hand and all you young techno-wiz-bang-slap-together-some-art 
goofballs need to take a step back and learn the ropes.  computers suck.

>>>>I agree that staring at someone using Ableton is boring, but so is 
watching a dj.   If you have no respect for computer music, but think that vinyl = 
art, you need to re-evaluate your logic.>>>

watching a dj is not boring if they can rip it right.  i pick up techs and 
tricks everytime i watch.  i have seen noname djs put the big names to shame, 
all for fun.  djing is an artform,
and when you try to mix the digi/cd element into it, it just looses its taste.

as far as vinyl being an artform well there is engineering, mastering, 
pressing and so on.
with cd there is that nice little "save as" button, geez, that was a tuff 
one.  (run it through the Waves Gold pack if your in doubt - free on-line too!)

lets not mention to all you young fuks that 12" RECORD shops keep this whole 
sceen and industry going and in line.  I give BIG PROPS to all the record 
store owners not to mention all the DISTRIBUTORS (watts , nemisis and the like) 
and lets not forget the pressing plants here that have familys to feed.   Its 
not easy competing with a 1$ piece of CD plastic crap produced by the sony music 
group.  who cares right.
support your sceen and buy some wax. raving is not a crime! plur!
the rave sceen in the states sux, im moovin to japan.
ha, this is great, read on and keep um comming this is kinda fun...

BTW saw DubTRibe bout 3X and that will go down in dogs book of all time great

props to Sunshine and Moonbeam!
cuz dam they used the oldskool Alesis MMT8s , SH101 (dood could use it too!)
a TB303 a EMAX sampler and dats it.  Oh and not to mention that siren of a

so tell me again why every art school in the world teaches photoshop?  you 
just dont get it...if u have a drawing tablet...photo shop is a fucking 
canvas...so why is using photoshop any less artistic?  you still have to 
know the color wheel...you still have to know howto draw...you stilll have 
to have an eye for what looks good...you can spend just as much time making 
a piece of art in photoshop as you can paiting it with traditional 
tools...and it actually takes longer to produce music in an all purely 
software environment...maybe if u use acid and a bunch of loops that arent 
chopped up and rearranged, and dont properly mix dwon...yeah maybe a tune 
could be banged out in 2 hours...but me personally...and every producer i 
know...we might start with a loop as a base...but then it gets turned into a 
new loop by chopping and mangling the loop with effects...plus evetything 
ive ever written had original loops in it that i programmed myself...youve 
obviously never written a tune...or maybe u just dont know how to w/ a 
computer and think u need hardware...well guess what bub...if u cant figure 
out producing w/ a computer...you're never gonna be able to do it with 
hardware, especially menu driven samplers and synths...i bet you couldnt 
even program an alesis midiverb and save the patch.

tell me again why mixing cds is any different from mixing vinyl...you cd 
haters seem to think there is a magic "beatmatch" button on cd 
players...well i can assure you there isnt...cds are mixed in the exact same 
way as records...and i bet if you werent watching the booth the whole 
time...you couldnt tell the difference between a clean record and a cd...

>with cd there is that nice little "save as" button, geez, that was a tuff
>one.  (run it through the Waves Gold pack if your in doubt - free on-line 
>too!)

engineeering and mastering goes into every tune regardless of medium...when 
you are bouncing midi tracks to audio...guess what...you are 
engineering...if u setup crazy effects chains...you are engineering...if 
mastering was as easy as running everything thru waves gold...why do 
mastering engineers even have jobs? id love to hear your "mastered" 
music...waves is a powerful tool...but if u dont know what u are doing(which 
is obviously the case)its just gonna make your stuff sound like ass...dont 
believe me? i have at least 20 tunes that i completely fucked up cuz i was 
getting crazy with waves(max bass and ultramaximiser)...by the way...90% of 
the stuff that is sent to be pressed...comes on cd or mp3...very few ppl 
actually send a 2 track master dat or rtr tape...oh and most mastering 
engineers have lots and lots of digital equipment...and they all have 
protools.

yeah its tuff running a record store...and im glad ppl do it...but record 
stores are only part of the equation keeping the scene moving...the ppl that 
go out to hear djs, the producers making the music for djs, the promoters 
putting up the money for the events, the sound/light ppl are just as 
important to keeping the scene moving as the record store(IMO)...the 
pressing plants arent going out of business anytime soon...cuz they do more 
business pressing cds than they ever will pressing dance vinyl..

>yea, all PRE PoGrAmmEd midi riffs but hell at least they gots some soul.

its not the tools used that make music great...its the content...are you 
gonna say kraftwerk suck cuz they went to cubase sx, and dont use moogs 
anymore?  what about prodigy? do u think they suck? they are using 
reason(infact their last LP was entirely made in reason)...do u think the 
mad professor sucks?  hes using reason too(longside his hardware)...i would 
venture to say that everything u hear pressed to wax used a computer to 
either sequence the midi, to record the audio, or both...even back in the 
day...people used ataris and comadores to sequence midi.

i fail to see how using a piece of software that emulates a piece of 
hardware is less artistic...analog style synth programming(as opposed to the 
way u program an emu keyboard or triton) is the same science in software as 
it is in hardware..its even the same science for menu driven synths..just 
not as easy...hell there are computer based synths that do things hardware 
couldnt dream of...absynth and malstrom spring to mind right away.

you talk a big game...lets hear some fucking tunes.

I believe [mark] posted the picture, twatface.
I'm just saying, the drinking vs. drugs flame war had its glory days in 1999
and 2000, when we had people like Zone and Grandpa to say crazy shit.  Now
it would just be pathetic.  In any case, I'm well aware that alcohol is a
drug and that our societal and political stances on substance abuse are
hypocritical and I don't feel like arguing about it anymore.

wiz bang a 
>"piece of digital art" together.  who cares.

so this is funny. you like synths, but not soft synths. synths are 
electronic, why not just be completely reactionary and like only 
pianists? the amount of stuff that photoshop does for you is at 
least the same as what drum machines and synths do for you. the 
fact that you draw a line between a synth on a laptop and a 
hardware synth, especially when both are electronics and even alot 
of analogues have digital control, makes basically no sense. if 
you were hardcore youd at least be anti midi and support only CV. 
shit, if you were really hardcore, you would multitrack everything 
live to reel to reel. but youre not hardcore, youre not shit. you 
some know nothing shit talking shit about shit you dont know shit 
about. good job. 

>I use Photoshop everyday.  I use a soft synth everyday also.  but 
this shit 
>is gettin out of hand and all you young techno-wiz-bang-slap-

>goofballs need to take a step back and learn the ropes.  
computers suck.

anything using midi is a computer. 

>watching a dj is not boring if they can rip it right.  i pick up 
techs and

names to shame, 
>all for fun.  djing is an artform,
>and when you try to mix the digi/cd element into it, it just 
looses its taste.

yeah because spinning vinyl discs is really cool, spinning polymer 
discs is weak. right? wtf have you been smoking ace? 

>as far as vinyl being an artform well there is engineering, 
mastering, 
>pressing and so on.
>with cd there is that nice little "save as" button, geez, that 
was a tuff 
>one.  (run it through the Waves Gold pack if your in doubt - free 
on-line too!)

and look at that, on top of everything you dont understand  the 
mastering process or what an engineer does. youre an idiot. 

>lets not mention to all you young fuks that 12" RECORD shops keep 
this whole 
>sceen and industry going and in line.  I give BIG PROPS to all

>and lets not forget the pressing plants here that have familys to 
feed.   Its 
>not easy competing with a 1$ piece of CD plastic crap produced by 
the sony music 
>group.  who cares right.

but records have been dead since the 80s when major labels quit 
making them, havent they? oh wait, that didnt happen. and guess 
what, it wont happen now. things might switch around to accomidate 
digital deejaying, but records will always exist. and in case you 
didnt notice, you can sell things other than vinyl in a store. 

>support your sceen and buy some wax. raving is not a crime! plur!
>the rave sceen in the states sux, im moovin to japan.

yeah because those guys NEVER use computers. sucker. 

>only if they know what they are doing.  otherwise its just 
watchin a wannabe 
>puttin wax on the platter....

and not suprisingly the same can be said of people deejaying with 
CDs or final scratch. also not suprisingly, youre a joker. 

>nice, put down the crack pipe hommie!  yea Skylab is the shit, 
word. 

thats an opinion that will definitely make me take you more 
seriously. 

>and fuk

>knobs just for us oldskoolers cuz dats the way it sounds best, 
sorry. (word up 
>Futureretro!)

what do you mean by old school? do you mean like Rhythim is 
Rhythim records that were made on yamaha digital synths in 87 and 
sequenced with computers using midi? or do you mean like old 
school jungle that was made on an atari and an akai? the myth that 
early house and detroit records were made with analogue is 
ridiculous. you can hear just as much digital shit on there as 
analogue. 

>cuz dam they used the oldskool Alesis MMT8s  

an mmt 8 is a computer. i dont know what else to say to you. 

>SH101 (dood could use it too!)
>a TB303 a EMAX sampler and dats it. 

all samplers are computers.

actually i think doing things on a computer might be much more 
difficult than using hardware simply because you can automate and 
record tweaks and multitrack with 50 zillion plugins at a time, 
plus do your own mastering and whatnot. plus mixing digitally 
doesnt give the same headroom as mixing on an analogue desk. 
personally i picked going all hardware to keep it as simple as 
possible. when you have unlimited tools at your fingertips it can 
be hard to know what to do with everything.

ive gotta agree. i mean, larry heard cranked out "washing 
machine", "can you feel it", and "beyond the clouds" in one day on 
an all hardware set up in 1986. the less layers and the less 
equipment you use, the easier it is to make a track sound good. 
its when you start mixing down something with 32 parts that you 
really gotta worry about frequencies overlapping and whatnot. the 
unlimited shit you can do with a computer definitely seems to make 
people try to cram as much shit in there as possible.

thats why i keep it mad simple. my sampler is mad simple to 
understand, and i keep a basic template disc in there so i can 
just send all my samples over via scsi and drop them right in for 
all my drum parts. simple is good, it lends itself to the creative 
process. knowing i dont have to sit around looking at a multiband 
compressor makes me a happy boy.

yeah, im really wondering what people think is going on with CDJs. 
really theyre harder to mix with because you cant touch the CD to 
slow it down the same way you can with a record, you have to 
approximate it with the wheel or whatever.

shit, if you ever programmed a synth youre engineering. 
engineering is pretty much any technical process done in a studio. 
production is the vision guiding the performance and the 
engineering. the performance is the actual person playing the 
rhythms and melodies. i dont know what some people think goes on 
with these titles either.

theres no need for DATs when CDs provide the same audio quality. 
but yeah, probably most music released out of bedroom studios at 
this point is in the digital realm.

its kind of funny how techno-phobic some electronic music can be

with analogue.

i totally agree...when i first started getting good with cubase in the
summer...i was getting really crazy with tracks and automation...so much
that cubase was crashing alot...then i realised the power of bouncing midi
to audio, and processing my effects instead of running them realtime...now i
can have lotsa tracks if i choose...and rock solid performance....i think as
long as u bounce your tracks at a reasonable level...like around -9db...you
can get as much headroom as you need...eq and pan can create amazing amounts
of space if u know what you are doing...there are some really great eq
tutorials out there...hipnotics(from doa) is by far the best ive read...even
better than the sound reinforcement engineers handbook(which set me back
40bux)

like i said..its all about normalising, proper eq, and panning the stereo
mix right....you dont need bass or mid bass on a flute...just like you dont
need anything over 120hz on a bass drum(and even that is getting a little
high)...there is lots of space to be had on the spectrum....remember there
is about 20,000 frequencies that can be used :)

my experience with hardware samplers is limited...but i think i could do
things faster with nnxt or kontakt than an akai/emu....no menu digging and
that...i guess if i were to buy a hardware sampler...id get one that allows
software control(like the newer akais/emus).


> yeah, im really wondering what people think is going on with CDJs.
> really theyre harder to mix with because you cant touch the CD to

me personally i try to mix with the pitch control as much as possible...if u
are comfortable mixing with p/c...the difference between cdj and a turntable
is pretty minimal...the jog wheel works just like twisting the spindle or
braking the spindle tho...so if u have to make a slight adjustment u dont
have to goto the pitch control.

spot on.

> theres no need for DATs when CDs provide the same audio quality.
> but yeah, probably most music released out of bedroom studios at

dats are natively 24bit arent they?  thats the only reason i can see for
doing a stereo mix to dat...of course you could just write the 24bit track
to a data cd...and then load into whatever daw the mastering engineer
uses...im willling to bet even stuff they get rtr gets dumped straight to
the daw.

> its kind of funny how techno-phobic some electronic music can be
> when so much of it is trying to be "futuristic". i like the old
> shit because i like the old sound.

the way i see it is...back in the day...the stuff they were using...was the
future...and if the godfathers had the technolgy we have now...they'd sure
as hell be using it...imagine what kinda shit wouldve been coming out in 88
if they had what we have now.

the only true analog sequencers are pianos and sheet music :)

if u think recompling your linux kernal everyday is fun...max/msp is for
you...there is some serious power there...but id rather spend my time
writing music as opposed to programming my own plugins...altho i have been
playing with the new version of vaz modular a bit...its pretty similar to
the software u get with a nord modular...but a whole hell of alot cheaper.

There's a lot of fun to be had in Max/MSP, and pluggo fo sho up in the 
flippity floppity floo. Me, I'm more of a Reaktor head.

But there's a lot of levels to both of these programs. You can have a 
lot of fun and get a lot of usefulness out of reaktor without every 
programming your own modular, hence Reaktor Session (just the 
instruments, a library of hundreds of instruments and effects made in 
reaktor).

Now, Audiomulch, that's an entirely different subject.

Do you still also hunt your own animals for meat and grow your own grain and vegetables in the yard?
Or do you let machines make the menial tasks of life a little bit easier?

It's reminder time... this is tomorrow night! Our Chicago peeps are getting REALLY excited to storm the decks... if you're going to miss the Abbasso late night vibe as much as I am, then you owe it to yourself (and humble Mr. Naps) to drop in. This one's gonna be memorable.

Oh, and did I mention CHEAP drinks? $3 Bass, $3 Dortmunders, $2 Miller Lights ALL NIGHT!

Cover is $5 after 1am. Come early, come late... we will be pumping out intelligent dance floor-friendly tech-house and techno all night. Again, set times are below. See you out... somewhere... on what is shaping up to be another really awesome weekend for music!

Dude, you're talking shit.  Quality artists spend much time  engineering/mastering sampler/computer tracks.  Do think that only tracks getting pressed on wax get mastered?  Writing a fresh sounding orginal drum loop on a sampler/sequencer is not as easy as hitting the save "button".

Let me guess, final scratch is for wack ass pussies too....right?

 

watching a dj is not boring if they can rip it right. i pick up techs and 
tricks everytime i watch. i have seen noname djs put the big names to shame, 
all for fun. djing is an artform,
and when you try to mix the digi/cd element into it, it just looses its taste.


as far as vinyl being an artform well there is engineering, mastering, 
pressing and so on.
with cd there is that nice little "save as" button, geez, that was a tuff 
one. (run it through the Waves Gold pack if your in doubt - free on-line too!)

It's going to be a long, crazy night..and one definitely not to be missed. I'll be out and about...really want to hear Andy too, but not sure it'll be possible.  Def. hit parts of FC5, Mnookin for the long haul, and Andy Caldweel probably.

Subject: {pb-cle} funky charms 5 addendum + netmeet

due to circumstances beyond anyones control, adam jensen will not be 
able to make it, in his place is pat blaze.  so react will not be

i say the netmeet at 2am at the battered armadillo / koala-tea stage 
(area #4). this will be the ground floor of heaven & earth.

email today/tonite to be added to the list?

so far we have:

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} funky charms 5 addendum + netmeet

Yeah, saturday is going to be busy.  Planned on staying around funky charms 
the whole night, but want to go to moda.  and... want to go to abbasso too.  
Umm, yeah, this sucks.  Might just be at funky charms the whole night.  May 
swing by abbasso aftewards to see if anyone is still there at 5:00 or 
whenever I leave FC.  Hope they don't charge the $5 that late into the night, 
if they even still have the doors open :)

Yeah, if all the DJ's from the previous Cook da Goose's and/or Inclination
Club Nights in Columbus could email me, that would be great.  I dont have
the distribution lists and email addresses that I used to have when I worked
at sarcom... People I need (in no particular order) to email me or get email
addresses for:
 
Ben Kenobi
Mike Salamon
Boompsie
Lee and Skillz
Gravity
Jason Lyman
Osmotic
 
People I dont need to email me cause I got their info:
 
Andy James
Lemma
Soniq
Ratana
Jwan
Shawn Rudiman
Tom sucks Cox
Moose
[mark]
Nick S
Colin Pierce
Jea
 
And here's where chemlab could have helped me cause it's sad that i know i'm
forgetting a couple people but i cant look through the archives...
 
I'd also like to know who else is interested in playing this year.  Closet
masturbators need not apply.

Subject: {pb-cle} This weekend

Well, I've been sitting here trying to plan everything out, even how 
to get ready when I get home from work.  Anywho I did figure out I 
can slip into abbasso just before 1:00 so I can come in and stick for 
a little bit and then off to FC4 again.  Couldn't get moda to fit in 
there, oh well, 2 out of the 3 main events isn't bad.  As for where 
I'll be, after traaaaats set will head over to the basement for a 
while and then go to abbasso and then go to the beach club for a few 
hours and then finish it off back at heaven and earth (yes, I 
actually planned this all out).  As for being able to spot me, umm, 
let's just say that anyone that knows me will be able to spot me 
extremely easily.  those that don't know me probably won't even 
notice anything special. ;)  Everyone going to moda have fun, and as 
been said before, everyone better be out somewhere saturday.

I just happened to turn the tv on when I was looking for the weather

BADGERS!!!.  so far I've learned that they are strong, stuborn, and 
easily tempered, and I've only seen about 20 mins of it :)  They are 
also apparently very idiotic since they like to invade bees nests for 
honey.  that and they like dung beetles, mm tasty.

Subject: {pb-cle} funky charms 5 addendum + netmeet

pictures of night one are posted at
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/fc5_nt1

due to circumstances beyond anyones control, adam jensen will not be
able to make it, in his place is pat blaze.  so react will not be
tagging with jensen, instead they will be doing 2 separate sets.
also a last minute *bonus* addition: majestic will be tagging with 
pollen (10:30-11:30)

i say the netmeet at 2am at the battered armadillo / koala-tea stage
(area #4). i'm not sure of the actual location of our stage, i believe 
it will be heaven and earth. probably upstairs.

so far we have:

trout & becky
fortius maxximus (alex)
dave lefebvre (lurker extraordinaire)
glowstickman todd flounder (vr)
amanda von schtupp and dave
ironman paul fleetwood
sleepyman paul berezansky
amy dana and dave deviant (headrush)
deep, gem, josh, & kelly
adam bomb
bill robb

sorry if i forgot anyone.  but hey feel free to show up anyhoo. i'm 
rushed and out the door shortly.

We'll be there sometime after 10:30 for awhile since Jamie's playing..I think upstairs at heaven and earth.  Won't be able to meet you all at 2 though since we've got Mnookin @ Abbasso probably getting into full force about that time.  It's a multi-tasking weekend.  Hope to catch everyone out and about somewhere at some point.

First off, have the pics up.  As usual, direct link is:

I got there around 8:30 or so after eventually finding a parking 
spot.  Now I know why I don't go to the east side of the flats.  
Really tight and confusing layout, even more than the west side.  
Anyway, got the first of may wristbands I'd accumulate and headed off 
to heaven and earth to see traaat spin.  But as I got there the guy 
stood outside and said that it's not open yet, even though I could 
hear music playing up there.  Anyway went to the earth part of it and 
hung around there for a couple mins.  Then checked out the beach 
club.  Wasn't really digging the music there and went to the basement 
and they weren't ready either.  wtf? a half hour into when everything 
should be playing and the two stages at heaven and the two stages at 
the basement weren't ready yet?  Anyway, I spent the next hour or so 
jumping around trying to get into heaven which was still closed (lol, 
just thought how funny that sentence is).  Finally around 10:00 I 
could go to heaven and check that out.  Just about the time Radin was 
getting off the decks, who I also wanted to see that night.  So I 
just went around, everyone was playing fine, just nothing really 
impressed me.  Plus it seems that the timeslot were all messed up.  
Was all pumped to hear a tag team hard trance set and they were over 
there playing dnb or house or something.  Left around 12:30 or so and 
spent a good 10 mins just trying to get out of my parking spot.  
parallel parked between a bmw and an accura or lexus or something, 
with about a 1-1/2 feet of space total to move in, with about 3 or 4 
inches from me and the bmw, if I didn't care about my car, would have 
just hit your car out of spite, ass.  Well, after that fiasco I 
headed off to abbasso.  Was diggin the beepy techno stuff, but was 
also practically falling asleep too.  Anyway, I just ended up staying 
there the rest of the night.  Wish napolean the best in wherever he 
goes.

Basically, to sum things up, I've had a better time at just one club 
for $15 (moda) and even at free nights at abbasso then I did at FC5, 
but I've also had much worse ones.  Just didn't seem as organized as 
it should be.  Oh well, at least I got to at least TRY blue hair, 
although it didn't come out as blue as I wanted it, maybe I'll try 
another color sometime down the road, or try combing the gel in or 
something.  Still wasn't bad for not using spiking gel in a good 6 or 
7 years.

Funky Charms the kids just love it! All in all it was a pretty good
event. Not sure why but police cut the music in the Beach Room 10 mins
before the end. There was a pretty heavy police presence there on both
nights. I thought it was cool someone came up to Andy James while he was
spinning Friday and asked for his autograph. I saw some kids from
Louisville, KY get turned away at the door for not having their ID's.

Stacey Pullen @ Moda was fun too. Kind of a thin crowd but a good vibe
and some great music.

Woooooooooooooooooh what a weekend for Cleveland.  Props to all the
promoters, DJs and clubs for putting together and hosting a huge amount of
electronic music around town.
 
To keep the good vibe rollin', this Monday's guests, whom I've been very
excited for, will be drum and bass DJ Majestic, and MC Mo Pacino.
 
If you've heard his mixtapes before, then you know Majestic knows how to
bring on the pressure.  Mo Pacino will keep it all in check with his
rhymes and do other magical things that MCs do that keep it all in check.
 
The station has just upgraded a few pieces of broadcast equipment, and I
must say, the air signal is sounding sweet.
 
Please tune in from 10:30p to 12:30 and hear some of the hottest
electronic music to hit the airwaves.  The webstream can be accessed at
wruw.org
 
As always, a live playlist can be found at beatmatrix.net, as well as
previous guest DJs playlists.

Thats crazy.  Same thing happened to me.  I was
passing out free copies of my record during my set and
some girl asked me to autograph it.  It was a good
time.  I thank Chris, Anthony, and Al for having me
out.

Good folk of the land,

Can someone who has a netMD tell me if It's possible to transfer field 
recordings back to PC over the USB, or will I have to do it over the 
audio connection? I've played with the check-in check-out feature, but 
I don't think that's what I need. If this is the case, I'm ebaying this 
thing and buying an archos.

- Mike

Funky Charms, what an awsome party.  I've been every year and once again this year did not dissappoint.  The first night I was kind of mad at first at the karma club for the lack of a "rave environment."  It seemed like it was just a nght at a Cleveland club.  But at Metropolis there were sceens and lights everywere and it was awsome.  The second night was even better.  The music was hot, and the idea of sperate venues was great.  My only complaint would be the Nazi SS security that searched you before going into EVERY spot.  I understand that it is for my safety, but it was a little rediculious.  They checked shoes and hats everywere and this really held up the lines.  I've never been to party were there was no drugs nor probably will I ever be.  If someone wants to get something in they will.
 
P.S. D-licious If your out ther my wife and I would like to thank you and your crew for your kindness.  You guys made a great party even better.  If you should see this, E-mail us at SmknBigBudz@sbcglobal.net .  You guys rock.
 
P.P.S.S Special thanx to Euphorix 
 
                                                              PLUR to all

Glad you had a good time. Out of curiosity, did you make it up to Heaven, the upstairs of "Earth?" It had a separate entrance.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} FC5 night2 review

sounds pretty close to how my night panned out as well.

first Heaven not "opening until 10"; then not serving alcohol left something 
to be desired. Especially when we weren't allowed to bring drinks up there.  
>From now on i'm bringing my own with me.

seeing 10-15 people walk up stairs find out the bar is not open and 
immediately turn around and leave was disappointing.  having this scene 
repeating 5 or 6 times, well you get the idea.  they missed some really 
decent music too.  The ones that were there and dancing knew it.  even the 
bartenders were wandering around dancing.  they might as well have some fun 
since they obviously weren't making any money.

there wasn't even a sign (that i can remember) to direct people upstairs.  
people who asked "what was upstairs" were quickly told by those walking back 
down not to "waste their time because there is no bar there" and quickly got 
in line for the other room or cross the street.

the only hint there was something going on upstairs was the velvet rope that 
some people actually thought was for the pizza/gyro stand right nextdoor.  
then, a member of your travelling party disappears and you have to search 
them, wasting an hour and a half in the cold to get into each club tops 
everything off. And we still never did find them.

on the other hand, abbasso was rockin and i heard probably the best music of 
the night there.  just wish i wasn't sick and half passed out on the back 
couch - so i just sat back and enjoyed it.  i will still challenge anyone to 
tetris and win - regardless of physical health.

to cap off an almost completely abysmal weekend it took an hour and a half 
to get from cranberry to pgh last evening because of the freezing rain 
between 79 & McNight road.  Anyone else that came back last night probably 
knows what i'm talking about.

Funky Charms the kids just love it! All in all it was a pretty good
event. Not sure why but police cut the music in the Beach Room 10 mins
before the end. There was a pretty heavy police presence there on both
nights. I thought it was cool someone came up to Andy James while he was
spinning Friday and asked for his autograph. I saw some kids from
Louisville, KY get turned away at the door for not having their ID's.

Stacey Pullen @ Moda was fun too. Kind of a thin crowd but a good vibe
and some great music.

Rave Is Dead

URB Magazine, Issue 102 /February 2003

Do you even remember rave? With clubs closing, labels folding and law 
enforcement agents in hot pursuit, rave culture disappeared under dubious 
circumstances. We spoke with more than 30 key players in the scene  DJs, 
promoters, agents, record shop owners, label managers and publicists  from 
all around the country and returned with the candy-colored autopsy.

Words: Bill Werde

"Rave is dead," says Lonnie Fisher. "How long you want to discuss why I feel 
that way is up to you." Fisher runs the production company Ultraworld. He 
has been to jail for throwing raves, has personally met with the City of 
Baltimore to gain the right to continue throwing raves, and, in addition to 
throwing the best raves on the East Coast throughout the mid-'90s, he threw 
the first I frequented. These were spectacles of lasers, acid house, breaks, 
and hundreds, sometimes thousands of kids filling warehouse spaces and 
industrial parks to meet their rave families, perhaps pop a pill or two and 
dance their kinetic dances. Fisher has opened a club, Sonar, in Baltimore, 
and says he has no plans to throw a rave again.

Some told me in '95 when I started going to parties that rave was dead. 
These were people who had been going for a few months or a few years longer 
than myself, folks who lamented large flyers and $15, $20, $25 ticket 
prices. But who were they to piss on my epiphanies? One day I was a frat boy 
with the full cultural baggage of the breed  shamefully tolerant of 
homophobic jokes and misogyny, considered dancing a mating ritual never to 
exceed an energetic shuffle  and almost as quickly as the next, I was a 
raver, hopping weekend busses or joining car caravans to seek out fantastic, 
relatively secret parties full of like-minded people who were united in 
their appreciation of the experience and the sound. It was the sound of 
tomorrow, these squelchy, alien acid-lines and pummeling barrages of bass 
rising through the smoke and dust. It was the sound of a brighter future, a 
time and place to come when people would know the physical and spiritual 
joys of dancing and there would be a mass understanding that being excellent 
to one another was really where it was at.

Right around the time that my life was being irrevocably altered by the rave 
scene's potent combination of ideology and chemicals, prominent journalist 
Simon Reynolds was working on an essay entitled "Rave Culture: Living Dream 
or Living Death." Eventually published in the '97 anthology The Clubcultures 
Reader, the piece begins with the acknowledgement that others are saying 
Rave is Dead.' Reynolds convincingly navigates a perceived dichotomy: On 
one hand, the business of rave was better than ever, thanks to post-rave 
sub-genres landing on the UK pop charts, and the mass embrace of the 
weekender/ecstasy lifestyle. "But as for the rave myth, the ideal of love, 
peace, unity and positivity" he wrote, "that's been smelling funny for quite 
awhile."

According to Reynolds, "rave culture has never really been about altering 
reality, merely exempting yourself from it for a little while." But this 
wasn't true for me, and perhaps it wasn't true for you either. There were 
ideas at play in the rave scene  not just drugged kids. Here was the 
paradigm of the concert flipped on ear: The star wasn't the DJ  not then, 
at least  but the crowd, the lighting, the pills, the physical space of the 
party itself. You didn't go to a party to stare at a musician. If you wanted 
passive entertainment, you went to a rock show. If you wanted to immerse 
yourself in entertainment, to take an active role in your own good time, you 
went to a rave.

With E, the full-on raver lifestyle means literally falling in love every 
weekend, then (with the inevitable mid-week crash) having your heart broken. 
Millions of kids across Europe are still riding this emotional 
roller-coaster. Always looking ahead to their next tryst with E, dying to 
gush, addicted to love, in love with . . . nothing.

Nothing? Even as Reynolds was using clinical, academic precision to spell 
out the nothingness of rave, it was changing my life, much the way I suspect 
it changed Reynolds' a few years earlier. When I called the author to ask 
him about the essay, he laughed: "That was written from a point of crisis of 
confidence, that thing that people go through after a couple of years when 
they start to have doubts that maybe it's not as exciting as it appears to 
be, and, even if it is, where is it all leading?" And he admitted what I 
suspected: "When I got into it in '91, there were loads of people saying it 
was dead, then."

Are raves somehow less culturally vital then they were a few years ago, or 
10 years ago, or than they were in 1986 in England? Does the commodification 
of a culture  the music being sold on car commercials, the fashion being 
sold at every mall in America for awhile (and now not even cool enough for 
that), even the pills being pimped at frat-houses and yuppie soirees across 
the U.S.  does it somehow erode the core experience? Or is passing that 
judgement just another version of jaded burnouts telling Reynolds he had 
missed the boat by '91?

I joined the NYC-Raves Internet mailing list and asked for a response from 
anyone who had gone to their first party in the past six months or so, and 
had what they would call a "spiritual," "enlightening" or "life-changing" 
experience. As the day went on, I was surprised by the complete lack of 
traffic. I received only a couple of mocking replies, and deafening silence. 
One post, from the list's moderator, was particularly snarky: "I think 
you're about two years too late."



.



The irony of Reynolds observation is that today, it seems he got it 
backwards. The ideals of rave  Peace, Love, Unity and Respect to some, 
simple DIY to others  live on in truly underground events and new rave 
converts and even in other parties, such as Burning Man. But the business? I 
spoke to more than 30 key players from the scene  DJs, promoters, agents, 
record shop owners, label managers and publicists  from all around the 
country, and this much is clear: The business of rave is crashing like a 
post-binge tweaker.

The rave and club scenes have long held a narcissistic sort of pride in 
straddling the line between mainstream and underground, happy to sell street 
cred to any and every willing consumer. But when it comes to organizing as 
an industry, electronica is in the dark ages. Mainstream music has Soundscan 
to chart album sales and Pollstar to detail the success of concerts and 
tours  services that raves and clubs do not utilize, certainly not with 
12-inches and one-offs. According to a source close to the major vinyl 
outlets in the U.S., sales were down about a quarter in 2001 from their 2000 
peak. This year, sales will finish down about a third from that 2000 mark. 
This is a greater decline than the slowing of the music industry at large, 
which is down about 20 percent over the same period. Across the pond, Record 
Industry, by far Europe's largest presser of vinyl, has seen orders drop by 
20 percent this year from last.

Two of the biggest and best clubs  New York's Twilo and DC's Buzz  have 
closed and at press time, Spundae in Los Angeles had just suffered a huge 
raid, leaving its future in some doubt. Attendance at big nightclubs is down 
across the board in the U.S. and the UK. According to international 
nightlife research group Mintel, nightclub and discotheque admissions in the 
UK grew steadily throughout the '90s until '98 when it took its first 
downturn, dropping steadily each year since. Two of the UK's larger clubs, 
Cream and Ministry, have closed, and a third, Gatecrasher has gone from a 
weekly event to a monthly. Ministry's self-titled magazine  at one point 
the top-selling title in British clubland  has folded.

Once blue-chip record labels have closed their doors or been relegated to 
the margins. In 2001, Ministry of Sound coughed up a substantial sum to sign 
electro up-and-comers Fischerspooner; now the label has released their 
Stateside employees (making them all sign confidentiality agreements) and 
auctioned off Fischerspooner to a major label. Strictly Rhythm  once one of 
the most respected labels in the game  closed its doors this year as well. 
Steve Lau is president of Kinetic records, the label that released trance 
"superstar DJ" Sasha's underperforming artist album, Airdrawndagger, earlier 
this year. Kinetic recently laid off all but a bare-bones staff. "It's a 
number of factors," says Lau of the dance music industry's decline. "There's 
the economy, of course. And I think the market was completely over-saturated 
with DJ mix compilations. Add to that that I think fans of electronic music 
are more technologically savvy, more likely to download music, than fans of 
other music. Also, on some level, I think everyone realizes that he or she 
could be a DJ. Part of the mystery behind the whole thing evaporated."

At the core of all of these industry developments is a feeder system of 
enthusiastic new customers that is grinding to a halt. Raves are not 
happening with the same frequency they once did, not by a long shot. "The 
rave scene is probably a quarter of what it was this time two years ago," 
says Scott Henry, the promoter of now-closed D.C. club Buzz, and a mainstay 
in the Baltimore-D.C. scene. "I judge that on calls my agent gets about 
bookings  not just me, but DJs across the line." Natalie Perez, a booking 
agent at PAM (a DJ management company that includes Paul van Dyk and DJ Icey 
on its roster) concurs: "Between now and this time last year, two years ago, 
we're having to be more aggressive in our tactics. We lower prices when 
needed. We've had to approach promoters more than we have in the past.

The danger is that fewer raves becomes its own prophecy. "You used to be 
able to go to like, Charlotte, North Carolina and there would be two raves 
on the same night," says Henry. "Now you're lucky if you can find one in the 
Southeast. Out of sight out of mind? I dont know. When [raves] are few and 
far between there is less to rally behind."



.



Sociology says we can think about subcultures cyclically. "Kids take the 
cultural products that are out there and they tweak them, misuse them," says 
David Grazian, a sociology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who 
specializes in the study of pop culture and its subcultures. "The easiest 
example to teach is how kids would rip holes in their jeans in the 1980s in 
order to create a new subcultural style. Then what happens? Jean 
manufacturers look at what kids are doing and they start mass marketing 
jeans that already have holes in them. As the cycle moves on, clearly it's 
companies that are winning. They are constantly able to make more profits by 
hunting down the cool."

I called Capitol records, the major label that turned Dirty Vegas's "Days Go 
By" into a hit by placing the song in a Mitsubishi car commercial. They were 
happy to talk to me because they're busy trying to repeat the formula: At 
press time, Mitsubishi was launching a new line of cars with 60-second TV 
spots, featuring the dreamy electronica of the song "Breathe" by another 
Capitol act, Telepopmusik. Telepopmusik's debut album, Genetic World, saw an 
immediate spike in sales, up 30 percent the first week, up another 76 
percent the next. As Tripp DuBois from Capitol's marketing department 
explained, Telepopmusik's positioning was the result of the careful 
cultivation of cool.

"We micro-marketed the record," said DuBois. " With Telepopmusik we did CD 
samplers and stickers. Our street teams worked the raves. It's that base we 
built and developed that allows us to get to the next step of exposure from 
Mitsubishi. When we go these advertising agencies, the band has to mean 
something. They have to say something. If it's the right thing, the new hip 
thing, then [these agencies] want to be part of the action as well. It's our 
job to get to that base so we can transition to the broader marker."

As DuBois spoke, I was daydreaming about how foreign raves seemed to me when 
I first went. There was no techno on commercials. There was no one handing 
out marketing materials, as best as I can recall, unless you count flyers 
for other parties. "We really nailed the game plan," said DuBois. 
"Mitsubishi kicked in and now we're transitioning. We're going to Modern 
Rock on November 19 and Top 40 on January 21. We're shooting a video and 
will ship another 50,000 units."

The big picture is that it seems rave  regardless of (or in addition to) a 
sagging economy and a crackdown by authorities  was in the process of 
down-cycling, subculturally, on its own. As techno DJ Richie Hawtin says, 
recalling his early days in the scene, "There was a sense of belonging to a 
group of people who had found common interests and united to do something a 
little different, rather than a group of people who had been marketed to." 
Or as U.S. rave originator Frankie Bones succinctly puts it, "I don't think 
14-or 15-year-olds today think rave is the cool thing to do anymore."

One look at the regional rave e-mail lists  once the lifeblood of 
information for a burgeoning grassroots scene  bears out this point. 
Traffic in all the major regions grew steadily through the end of 2000, then 
began a freefall. Sometime around early 2001, MW-raves, Mountain-raves, 
NYC-raves and SF-Raves all took a dive. In many instances, traffic steadily 
fell to pre-'96 numbers; in July, MW-raves had its lowest volume since 
October of 1993. In other words, people were rapidly losing interest in 
raves at the same time that the Feds were making their first big bust with 
"Disco" Donnie Estopinal in New Orleans. As much as the Feds might like to 
congratulate themselves, they didn't kill the scene. We managed that on our 
own.

Folks are quick to point fingers now. Nowhere is the animosity more present 
than in the relationship between promoters and superstar DJs. "The agents 
and the big-name DJs refused to give the promoters of the one-off events any 
breathing room on their fees," says Fisher, "to the point where the big 
promoters couldnt make money. Over the last three years I subsidized Paul 
van Dyk to play in D.C. while I sweat my ass off and lost money. I 
subsidized Boy George while I worked my ass off and lost money. The dance 
music scene refused to respect individual markets for what they were. I 
dont give a shit if you can draw 40,000 people in LA. In Baltimore and DC 
you cant. Promoters and some big name DJs had no respect for that. They'd 
tell you 'Well, I'd rather not play.'"

But if you talk to the agents, it's the promoters that are greedy. "One of 
two people gets the money," says Gerry Gerrard, the agent of luminaries 
including Oakenfold, Prodigy and Chemical Brothers. "The promoter or the DJ. 
My job is to make sure the DJ gets his fair share."

"It sucks what's happening right now," says Kurt Eckes, from Milwaukee's 
DropBass Network, the promoters behind the Midwest's Further festivals. "But 
it's also sweet revenge. I can still do underground events and keep my ball 
rolling. But at least all these DJs counting on these $10,000 nights aren't 
getting them anymore."

So here we are, the bitter, the jaded, the disappointed: the rave scene. 
Some people were and are true to the scene, to the music. Others just wanted 
to profit, and many, probably, sought the best of both worlds. "I've been 
doing this for years now," said Scott Richmond, one of the owners of 
Satellite Records, one of the top vinyl outlets in New York, during a heated 
conversation about money corrupting the art that was the rave scene. "Don't 
I have a right to make a living!?" And it's true, we all have the right to 
make a living. But that right was never guaranteed from the rave scene. 
Rave, at its origins, was just a couple of turntables, some good records, 
and people that wanted to dance. The rave scene today is Shel Silverstein's 
Giving Tree. It gave its music, its fashion, its coolness. Now who will sit 
with its lonely stump of a DIY ethic when there is no more money to make?



.



Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Some 12, 13 years ago, a Bush was in office, 
our economy was tanking, and the drums of war with Iraq were the perfect 
backdrop for rave to flourish. Today, history has eerily repeated itself. It 
won't be rave that benefits from all that energy of dissent, though, but 
rather whatever is next. Subcultures never die; they just fade into the 
cultural detritus from which new art forms grow. The hippies didnt last 
forever, neither did disco or punk. Yet key elements from these subcultures 
came together and fostered techno-drenched outlaw parties. One of the few 
e-mail lists I found with increasing membership was "Digital Hell," a 
mailing list for desktop maestros. "The dance floors may be thinning," says 
Wally Winfrey, list moderator. "But the bedrooms are full of activity. I 
reckon we'll see the fruition of that in the next few years."

There are mixed emotions at the wake. Some embrace denial, pointing to the 
one-offs that, while dwindling, will lumber on for a time; there is still 
money to be made, after all. Others offer up the occasional breakout chart 
hits, the Mobys, the Dirty Vegases, as if that has anything to do with rave. 
The very word itself has become an unsanitary term, four letters that embody 
everything that was corporate and drug-addled and exploited about a musical 
and cultural movement. I'm talking to Sasson Perry of Bay Area-based 
Coolworld promotions, who has thrown a series of parties that have drawn in 
excess of 15,000 people. And every time I ask him about raves, he stops the 
conversation and, politely but firmly, explains to me that he promotes 
"dance music festivals." Scott Henry recalls that when Fox News did an 
"expose" on his club  sneaking in some cameras and splashing drug use on 
the evening news  "They just kept using that word over and over again, 
enunciating it each time. Do you know what a rave is? This is a rave. Your 
kids might be going to raves."

So let us spare the false spin of positivity and go out like we came in, 
with dignity. The two great house DJs Mark Farina and Derrick Carter were 
roommates in Chicago in the late 80s and early 90s, throwing parties 
before they were called raves, before anyone knew how they were supposed to 
dress or what PLUR meant. "We were playing underground, Detroit, Chicago 
tracky minimal stuff to maybe 200 people," says Farina. "You were doin' a 
party to provide better music, do a better venue than the next guy. It was 
competitive like that as opposed to 'I'm gonna do bank on this party'."

"You could rent someone's loft for the night for like $300," remembers 
Carter. "If you knew someone, maybe a cat's a little low on their rent? 
$150, $200 for the sound system, cover the kegs and everyone gets 50 bucks 
lunch money or whatever. Cause shit! I got all these records sitting in my 
house. I don't eat properly and I look stupid cause I can't afford good 
clothes. But I got these hot-ass records. Shit! These records gonna get 
heard. I'm gonna have a party and play good records and laugh and see people 
we like and it'll be cool. That was all right. It was enough."

It was enough. Savor your memories as we share a moment of silence for rave, 
a glowstick poured out for our homies onto the cold concrete of a deserted 
warehouse floor. Perhaps it will be enough again, in some other way, in some 
time to be. And the dance will begin anew.

Yes, I killed it when I did a speed garage version of foreigner's "Cold as
Ice" as few years ago, sometime after CDG2.

But at Metropolis there were sceens and lights everywere and it was awsome.  The second night was even better.  The music was hot, and the idea of sperate venues was great.  My only complaint would be the Nazi SS security that searched you before going into EVERY spot.  I understand that it is for my safety, but it was a little rediculious.  They checked shoes and hats everywere and this really held up the lines.  I've never been to party were there was no drugs nor probably will I ever be.  If someone wants to get something in they will.

Wow way to be negative and totally trash on and alienate 3/4 of the people that were there.  No offense but who the hell are you, you were after all at a rave.  Just becase someone is dressed a certain way ("rave trash") does not mean they are on drugs or doing anything othere than having a good time, just like you.  Bye the way, what did you wear to the party a three piece suit.  I also did not say that saturday was with out flaws.  I just felt the second half of friday and overall saturday were the best parts.  But this could also be due the fact that my wife and I met a lot of awsome people ("rave trash") on saturday and mostly stayed at heaven and earth.
Its late I'm going to bed Peace to all goodnight.

Not only is Paul right...though some what biased...I am fairly convinced
that Raver's have less that half the brains of us normal people. Anyone who
was upstairs in Heaven and knows about the lengths we went to try and get
people to come up knows exactly what I mean.

That and some girl I handed a flyer to decides to introduce me to all 5
members of her travelling party...and I'm like, ok? But only then did I
notice that she was talking like 100 mph, and her pupils were the size of
pennies. I ran off laughing with her screaming "no wait, I haven't

It was enough. Savor your memories as we share a moment of silence for 
rave, 
a glowstick poured out for our homies onto the cold concrete of a 
deserted warehouse.

Rave Is Dead

URB Magazine, Issue 102 /February 2003

Do you even remember rave? With clubs closing, labels folding and law 
enforcement agents in hot pursuit, rave culture disappeared under dubious 
circumstances. We spoke with more than 30 key players in the scene  DJs, 
promoters, agents, record shop owners, label managers and publicists  from 
all around the country and returned with the candy-colored autopsy.

Words: Bill Werde

"Rave is dead," says Lonnie Fisher. "How long you want to discuss why I feel 
that way is up to you." Fisher runs the production company Ultraworld. He 
has been to jail for throwing raves, has personally met with the City of 
Baltimore to gain the right to continue throwing raves, and, in addition to 
throwing the best raves on the East Coast throughout the mid-'90s, he threw 
the first I frequented. These were spectacles of lasers, acid house, breaks, 
and hundreds, sometimes thousands of kids filling warehouse spaces and 
industrial parks to meet their rave families, perhaps pop a pill or two and 
dance their kinetic dances. Fisher has opened a club, Sonar, in Baltimore, 
and says he has no plans to throw a rave again.

Some told me in '95 when I started going to parties that rave was dead. 
These were people who had been going for a few months or a few years longer 
than myself, folks who lamented large flyers and $15, $20, $25 ticket 
prices. But who were they to piss on my epiphanies? One day I was a frat boy 
with the full cultural baggage of the breed  shamefully tolerant of 
homophobic jokes and misogyny, considered dancing a mating ritual never to 
exceed an energetic shuffle  and almost as quickly as the next, I was a 
raver, hopping weekend busses or joining car caravans to seek out fantastic, 
relatively secret parties full of like-minded people who were united in 
their appreciation of the experience and the sound. It was the sound of 
tomorrow, these squelchy, alien acid-lines and pummeling barrages of bass 
rising through the smoke and dust. It was the sound of a brighter future, a 
time and place to come when people would know the physical and spiritual 
joys of dancing and there would be a mass understanding that being excellent 
to one another was really where it was at.

Right around the time that my life was being irrevocably altered by the rave 
scene's potent combination of ideology and chemicals, prominent journalist 
Simon Reynolds was working on an essay entitled "Rave Culture: Living Dream 
or Living Death." Eventually published in the '97 anthology The Clubcultures 
Reader, the piece begins with the acknowledgement that others are saying 
Rave is Dead.' Reynolds convincingly navigates a perceived dichotomy: On 
one hand, the business of rave was better than ever, thanks to post-rave 
sub-genres landing on the UK pop charts, and the mass embrace of the 
weekender/ecstasy lifestyle. "But as for the rave myth, the ideal of love, 
peace, unity and positivity" he wrote, "that's been smelling funny for quite 
awhile."

According to Reynolds, "rave culture has never really been about altering 
reality, merely exempting yourself from it for a little while." But this 
wasn't true for me, and perhaps it wasn't true for you either. There were 
ideas at play in the rave scene  not just drugged kids. Here was the 
paradigm of the concert flipped on ear: The star wasn't the DJ  not then, 
at least  but the crowd, the lighting, the pills, the physical space of the 
party itself. You didn't go to a party to stare at a musician. If you wanted 
passive entertainment, you went to a rock show. If you wanted to immerse 
yourself in entertainment, to take an active role in your own good time, you 
went to a rave.

With E, the full-on raver lifestyle means literally falling in love every 
weekend, then (with the inevitable mid-week crash) having your heart broken. 
Millions of kids across Europe are still riding this emotional 
roller-coaster. Always looking ahead to their next tryst with E, dying to 
gush, addicted to love, in love with . . . nothing.

Nothing? Even as Reynolds was using clinical, academic precision to spell 
out the nothingness of rave, it was changing my life, much the way I suspect 
it changed Reynolds' a few years earlier. When I called the author to ask 
him about the essay, he laughed: "That was written from a point of crisis of 
confidence, that thing that people go through after a couple of years when 
they start to have doubts that maybe it's not as exciting as it appears to 
be, and, even if it is, where is it all leading?" And he admitted what I 
suspected: "When I got into it in '91, there were loads of people saying it 
was dead, then."

Are raves somehow less culturally vital then they were a few years ago, or 
10 years ago, or than they were in 1986 in England? Does the commodification 
of a culture  the music being sold on car commercials, the fashion being 
sold at every mall in America for awhile (and now not even cool enough for 
that), even the pills being pimped at frat-houses and yuppie soirees across 
the U.S.  does it somehow erode the core experience? Or is passing that 
judgement just another version of jaded burnouts telling Reynolds he had 
missed the boat by '91?

I joined the NYC-Raves Internet mailing list and asked for a response from 
anyone who had gone to their first party in the past six months or so, and 
had what they would call a "spiritual," "enlightening" or "life-changing" 
experience. As the day went on, I was surprised by the complete lack of 
traffic. I received only a couple of mocking replies, and deafening silence. 
One post, from the list's moderator, was particularly snarky: "I think 
you're about two years too late."



.



The irony of Reynolds observation is that today, it seems he got it 
backwards. The ideals of rave  Peace, Love, Unity and Respect to some, 
simple DIY to others  live on in truly underground events and new rave 
converts and even in other parties, such as Burning Man. But the business? I 
spoke to more than 30 key players from the scene  DJs, promoters, agents, 
record shop owners, label managers and publicists  from all around the 
country, and this much is clear: The business of rave is crashing like a 
post-binge tweaker.

The rave and club scenes have long held a narcissistic sort of pride in 
straddling the line between mainstream and underground, happy to sell street 
cred to any and every willing consumer. But when it comes to organizing as 
an industry, electronica is in the dark ages. Mainstream music has Soundscan 
to chart album sales and Pollstar to detail the success of concerts and 
tours  services that raves and clubs do not utilize, certainly not with 
12-inches and one-offs. According to a source close to the major vinyl 
outlets in the U.S., sales were down about a quarter in 2001 from their 2000 
peak. This year, sales will finish down about a third from that 2000 mark. 
This is a greater decline than the slowing of the music industry at large, 
which is down about 20 percent over the same period. Across the pond, Record 
Industry, by far Europe's largest presser of vinyl, has seen orders drop by 
20 percent this year from last.

Two of the biggest and best clubs  New York's Twilo and DC's Buzz  have 
closed and at press time, Spundae in Los Angeles had just suffered a huge 
raid, leaving its future in some doubt. Attendance at big nightclubs is down 
across the board in the U.S. and the UK. According to international 
nightlife research group Mintel, nightclub and discotheque admissions in the 
UK grew steadily throughout the '90s until '98 when it took its first 
downturn, dropping steadily each year since. Two of the UK's larger clubs, 
Cream and Ministry, have closed, and a third, Gatecrasher has gone from a 
weekly event to a monthly. Ministry's self-titled magazine  at one point 
the top-selling title in British clubland  has folded.

Once blue-chip record labels have closed their doors or been relegated to 
the margins. In 2001, Ministry of Sound coughed up a substantial sum to sign 
electro up-and-comers Fischerspooner; now the label has released their 
Stateside employees (making them all sign confidentiality agreements) and 
auctioned off Fischerspooner to a major label. Strictly Rhythm  once one of 
the most respected labels in the game  closed its doors this year as well. 
Steve Lau is president of Kinetic records, the label that released trance 
"superstar DJ" Sasha's underperforming artist album, Airdrawndagger, earlier 
this year. Kinetic recently laid off all but a bare-bones staff. "It's a 
number of factors," says Lau of the dance music industry's decline. "There's 
the economy, of course. And I think the market was completely over-saturated 
with DJ mix compilations. Add to that that I think fans of electronic music 
are more technologically savvy, more likely to download music, than fans of 
other music. Also, on some level, I think everyone realizes that he or she 
could be a DJ. Part of the mystery behind the whole thing evaporated."

At the core of all of these industry developments is a feeder system of 
enthusiastic new customers that is grinding to a halt. Raves are not 
happening with the same frequency they once did, not by a long shot. "The 
rave scene is probably a quarter of what it was this time two years ago," 
says Scott Henry, the promoter of now-closed D.C. club Buzz, and a mainstay 
in the Baltimore-D.C. scene. "I judge that on calls my agent gets about 
bookings  not just me, but DJs across the line." Natalie Perez, a booking 
agent at PAM (a DJ management company that includes Paul van Dyk and DJ Icey 
on its roster) concurs: "Between now and this time last year, two years ago, 
we're having to be more aggressive in our tactics. We lower prices when 
needed. We've had to approach promoters more than we have in the past.

The danger is that fewer raves becomes its own prophecy. "You used to be 
able to go to like, Charlotte, North Carolina and there would be two raves 
on the same night," says Henry. "Now you're lucky if you can find one in the 
Southeast. Out of sight out of mind? I dont know. When [raves] are few and 
far between there is less to rally behind."



.



Sociology says we can think about subcultures cyclically. "Kids take the 
cultural products that are out there and they tweak them, misuse them," says 
David Grazian, a sociology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who 
specializes in the study of pop culture and its subcultures. "The easiest 
example to teach is how kids would rip holes in their jeans in the 1980s in 
order to create a new subcultural style. Then what happens? Jean 
manufacturers look at what kids are doing and they start mass marketing 
jeans that already have holes in them. As the cycle moves on, clearly it's 
companies that are winning. They are constantly able to make more profits by 
hunting down the cool."

I called Capitol records, the major label that turned Dirty Vegas's "Days Go 
By" into a hit by placing the song in a Mitsubishi car commercial. They were 
happy to talk to me because they're busy trying to repeat the formula: At 
press time, Mitsubishi was launching a new line of cars with 60-second TV 
spots, featuring the dreamy electronica of the song "Breathe" by another 
Capitol act, Telepopmusik. Telepopmusik's debut album, Genetic World, saw an 
immediate spike in sales, up 30 percent the first week, up another 76 
percent the next. As Tripp DuBois from Capitol's marketing department 
explained, Telepopmusik's positioning was the result of the careful 
cultivation of cool.

"We micro-marketed the record," said DuBois. " With Telepopmusik we did CD 
samplers and stickers. Our street teams worked the raves. It's that base we 
built and developed that allows us to get to the next step of exposure from 
Mitsubishi. When we go these advertising agencies, the band has to mean 
something. They have to say something. If it's the right thing, the new hip 
thing, then [these agencies] want to be part of the action as well. It's our 
job to get to that base so we can transition to the broader marker."

As DuBois spoke, I was daydreaming about how foreign raves seemed to me when 
I first went. There was no techno on commercials. There was no one handing 
out marketing materials, as best as I can recall, unless you count flyers 
for other parties. "We really nailed the game plan," said DuBois. 
"Mitsubishi kicked in and now we're transitioning. We're going to Modern 
Rock on November 19 and Top 40 on January 21. We're shooting a video and 
will ship another 50,000 units."

The big picture is that it seems rave  regardless of (or in addition to) a 
sagging economy and a crackdown by authorities  was in the process of 
down-cycling, subculturally, on its own. As techno DJ Richie Hawtin says, 
recalling his early days in the scene, "There was a sense of belonging to a 
group of people who had found common interests and united to do something a 
little different, rather than a group of people who had been marketed to." 
Or as U.S. rave originator Frankie Bones succinctly puts it, "I don't think 
14-or 15-year-olds today think rave is the cool thing to do anymore."

One look at the regional rave e-mail lists  once the lifeblood of 
information for a burgeoning grassroots scene  bears out this point. 
Traffic in all the major regions grew steadily through the end of 2000, then 
began a freefall. Sometime around early 2001, MW-raves, Mountain-raves, 
NYC-raves and SF-Raves all took a dive. In many instances, traffic steadily 
fell to pre-'96 numbers; in July, MW-raves had its lowest volume since 
October of 1993. In other words, people were rapidly losing interest in 
raves at the same time that the Feds were making their first big bust with 
"Disco" Donnie Estopinal in New Orleans. As much as the Feds might like to 
congratulate themselves, they didn't kill the scene. We managed that on our 
own.

Folks are quick to point fingers now. Nowhere is the animosity more present 
than in the relationship between promoters and superstar DJs. "The agents 
and the big-name DJs refused to give the promoters of the one-off events any 
breathing room on their fees," says Fisher, "to the point where the big 
promoters couldnt make money. Over the last three years I subsidized Paul 
van Dyk to play in D.C. while I sweat my ass off and lost money. I 
subsidized Boy George while I worked my ass off and lost money. The dance 
music scene refused to respect individual markets for what they were. I 
dont give a shit if you can draw 40,000 people in LA. In Baltimore and DC 
you cant. Promoters and some big name DJs had no respect for that. They'd 
tell you 'Well, I'd rather not play.'"

But if you talk to the agents, it's the promoters that are greedy. "One of 
two people gets the money," says Gerry Gerrard, the agent of luminaries 
including Oakenfold, Prodigy and Chemical Brothers. "The promoter or the DJ. 
My job is to make sure the DJ gets his fair share."

"It sucks what's happening right now," says Kurt Eckes, from Milwaukee's 
DropBass Network, the promoters behind the Midwest's Further festivals. "But 
it's also sweet revenge. I can still do underground events and keep my ball 
rolling. But at least all these DJs counting on these $10,000 nights aren't 
getting them anymore."

So here we are, the bitter, the jaded, the disappointed: the rave scene. 
Some people were and are true to the scene, to the music. Others just wanted 
to profit, and many, probably, sought the best of both worlds. "I've been 
doing this for years now," said Scott Richmond, one of the owners of 
Satellite Records, one of the top vinyl outlets in New York, during a heated 
conversation about money corrupting the art that was the rave scene. "Don't 
I have a right to make a living!?" And it's true, we all have the right to 
make a living. But that right was never guaranteed from the rave scene. 
Rave, at its origins, was just a couple of turntables, some good records, 
and people that wanted to dance. The rave scene today is Shel Silverstein's 
Giving Tree. It gave its music, its fashion, its coolness. Now who will sit 
with its lonely stump of a DIY ethic when there is no more money to make?



.



Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Some 12, 13 years ago, a Bush was in office, 
our economy was tanking, and the drums of war with Iraq were the perfect 
backdrop for rave to flourish. Today, history has eerily repeated itself. It 
won't be rave that benefits from all that energy of dissent, though, but 
rather whatever is next. Subcultures never die; they just fade into the 
cultural detritus from which new art forms grow. The hippies didnt last 
forever, neither did disco or punk. Yet key elements from these subcultures 
came together and fostered techno-drenched outlaw parties. One of the few 
e-mail lists I found with increasing membership was "Digital Hell," a 
mailing list for desktop maestros. "The dance floors may be thinning," says 
Wally Winfrey, list moderator. "But the bedrooms are full of activity. I 
reckon we'll see the fruition of that in the next few years."

There are mixed emotions at the wake. Some embrace denial, pointing to the 
one-offs that, while dwindling, will lumber on for a time; there is still 
money to be made, after all. Others offer up the occasional breakout chart 
hits, the Mobys, the Dirty Vegases, as if that has anything to do with rave. 
The very word itself has become an unsanitary term, four letters that embody 
everything that was corporate and drug-addled and exploited about a musical 
and cultural movement. I'm talking to Sasson Perry of Bay Area-based 
Coolworld promotions, who has thrown a series of parties that have drawn in 
excess of 15,000 people. And every time I ask him about raves, he stops the 
conversation and, politely but firmly, explains to me that he promotes 
"dance music festivals." Scott Henry recalls that when Fox News did an 
"expose" on his club  sneaking in some cameras and splashing drug use on 
the evening news  "They just kept using that word over and over again, 
enunciating it each time. Do you know what a rave is? This is a rave. Your 
kids might be going to raves."

So let us spare the false spin of positivity and go out like we came in, 
with dignity. The two great house DJs Mark Farina and Derrick Carter were 
roommates in Chicago in the late 80s and early 90s, throwing parties 
before they were called raves, before anyone knew how they were supposed to 
dress or what PLUR meant. "We were playing underground, Detroit, Chicago 
tracky minimal stuff to maybe 200 people," says Farina. "You were doin' a 
party to provide better music, do a better venue than the next guy. It was 
competitive like that as opposed to 'I'm gonna do bank on this party'."

"You could rent someone's loft for the night for like $300," remembers 
Carter. "If you knew someone, maybe a cat's a little low on their rent? 
$150, $200 for the sound system, cover the kegs and everyone gets 50 bucks 
lunch money or whatever. Cause shit! I got all these records sitting in my 
house. I don't eat properly and I look stupid cause I can't afford good 
clothes. But I got these hot-ass records. Shit! These records gonna get 
heard. I'm gonna have a party and play good records and laugh and see people 
we like and it'll be cool. That was all right. It was enough."

It was enough. Savor your memories as we share a moment of silence for rave, 
a glowstick poured out for our homies onto the cold concrete of a deserted 
warehouse floor. Perhaps it will be enough again, in some other way, in some 
time to be. And the dance will begin anew.

I totally respect that if you do wear a suit and wouldn"t make fun of you if you did.  I guess my problem with with what your saying is is that it is what"s wrong with our scene.  When did we become divided into candy ravers and "normal people".  I realize that there are a lot of kids abusing drugs walking around like zombies.  That is also bad for the scene.  What happened to the let everyone be attitude?  Bye the way, way to encourage people to go to FIRE bye telling them you'll burn the candy (real F***IN positive).  Ignorant coments like this are why this scene (though strong ) is falling apart before our eyes.  I might go to fire, I might wear candy, and I might have an awsome time, and i might not eat X pills till my pupils are as big as pennies.  Thank you very much.   

P.S If you are going to raves with any kind of frequency then you are a raver (with all do respect)
 
peace to all

Not hardly. A couple points you should observe. This is anything but a "raver" 
list in the way that you would define it. Very few people on this list could 
give a rats ass about what they are on or how fucked up they can get before 
dawn. Most people here are in there late 20's early 30's. Its a more "mature" 
environment. These people have been "raving" forever. Most of us watched the 
beloved "scene" (which you speak of without any true sense of what it was 
really about). Freedom and mutal respect. These little rats flowed in and 
ruined it for everyone. 

You want to enance your evening go for it. But when kids are puddled up and 
wacked out on there varity bags then it hurts everyone. Caddy and Caddy kids 
get ripped on not because of how the dress but because the have no fucking 
clue.

The scene does not suck because we are diveded it sucks because we where 
invaded.

My 2 cents.

Your absoluty right.  How do you sit there and tell me I dont konw what its about when your pretty much repeating the exact thing I just said. (freedom & MUTUAL respect)  I,m almost 25 and my wife is almost 30 we've been to parties all over this country.  I used to live in Cali. where ther is a scene, and to see 500-5000 people at party is no big deal.  Ive been doing this for danm near ten years and Im all about love and respect.  So while you sit ther on your high and mighty bar stool and pretentiously sip your beer I'll be ther in my candy not on drugs dancing my ass off and having a great time.  I know ther are people that do so much drugs at a party that they are visibly fucked up, and that is a shame because they probably wont remember the good time they had and the people they met.  If a few stupid fifteen year olds doing drugs in the corner is ruining your good time then I feel bad for you.

To My Dearest Wife

My Dearest Wife, 

During the past year, I have attempted to make love to
you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an
average of only once every 10 days. The following is a
list of why I didn't succeed more often:

We will wake the kids - 54 times

It's too late - 15 times

I'm too tired - 42 times

It's too early - 12 times

It's too hot - 18 times

Pretending to be asleep - 31 times

The neighbors will hear - 9 times

Headache or backache - 26 times

Sunburn - 10 times

Your mother will hear us - 9 times

Not in the mood - 21 times

Watching the late show - 17 times

Too sore - 26 times

New hairdo - 6 times

Wrong time of the month - 14 times

You had to go to the bathroom - 19 times

Of the 36 times that I DID succeed, the result was not
always satisfying because 6 times you just laid there,
8 times you reminded me that there was a crack in the
ceiling, 4 times you told me to hurry up and get it
over with, 7 times I had to wake you up to tell you I
was finished, and once I was afraid that I had hurt
you because you started thrashing around and breathing
heavy. Let's try to improve this, shall we??

Love, Your Hubby

-------------------------

To My Dearest Husband,

I think things are a little confused. Here are the
REAL reasons you didn't get more than you did this
past year:

Came home drunk and tried to screw the cat - 23 times

Did not come home at all - 36 times

Did not come - 21 times

Came too soon - 38 times

Went soft before you got it in - 19 times

Cramps in your leg - 16 times

Working too late - 33 times

You had a rash, probably from a toilet seat - 29 times

Caught yourself in your zipper - 15 times

You had a cold and your nose kept running - 21 times

You had burned your tongue on hot coffee - 9 times

You had a splinter in your finger - 11 times

You lost the notion after thinking about it - 42 times

Came in your pajamas after reading a dirty book - 16
times

The reason I laid still was because you had missed me
and were screwing the sheet. You seemed to be having a
good time and I didn't want to move and spoil it for
you. I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling.
What I said was, "Would you like me on my back or
kneeling?" The time I was thrashing around and gasping
was when you farted and I was fighting for air. Maybe
you can work on your "shortcomings?"

Love, Your Wife

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FC 5 was the bomb!

Granted the majority of speed garage was produced between 94 and 98, but there are new garage tracks still being made. Besides the club was so packed with people dancing that the nazi security turned people away. Those were the people dancing on the sidewalk and in the street.  I danced my ass off, sober, on a sprained ankle. Skillz tore it up!
I am waiting to see chicks throw their panties at him like he's elvis or the beatles.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} D-licious (Funky charms 5)


only thing i have to add is that it's at least worth
noting that some of these puddle kids will eventually
realized that excessive drug use/abuse isn't really
the thing to do after all and those of them who really
do love the music will stick around and become the
"cool" kids in the bars drinking guinness, IF they
arent turned away from the whole business by a bunch
of people who  are acting rude toward them becuase
they are disappointed by it, however understandable
this feeling is. i mean i think not knowing where to
stop is pretty characteristc of being young, although
some take much longer than others to grow up. it's
unfortunate that it takes the more open mind of a
younger person to be open to non-mainstream music and
culture, otherwise maybe more adults would want to
come to parties. for my part, the best times i had at
parties was honestly when i was rolling too hard to be
worried about being cool or not being a dork, during
which times i'm positive anyone not in the same
condition would've found me to be a pretty seriously
dorky mofo (i'll even openly admit to haveing a visor
with a smiley star guy painted on it). fine. but i had
a great time and danced all night and truly enjoyed
myself. then i started getting into spinning and being
critical, and political games and taste ala
picky-ness, and my innocence was lost. now i still
have a great time with no drugs, but it's just a
different kind of good time. i think the rave scene
died because the main thing that made it popular was
that it was new and underground, now that it is no
longer either thing it has changed as people are out
looking for the thing that is still new and
underground, or "hip," or "mature" or whatever the
hell. and also because of mainstream media
misrepresenting it as a drug-market, so that kids who
were really just looking to buy or sell drugs would
know exactly where to go, thus turning it into exactly
that. what about the "hippie festivals?" they still go
on and on, regardless of excessive drug use, is it
just that for most people "raving" was a fad,
something to do to feel like you were "on the edge"
for a minute before getting back to your usual
real-world self? certainly not for me. anyway that's
just my opinion, flush it down the terlet if you wish.

Exactly,  You just said everything I was thinking but didnt Know how to put on the page.  Regardless of which side of the fence your on bashing the other only brings us all down.  I admit I used to be one of those "puddles".  Hell I admit on occasion I still enjoy a pill, but the key word is A pill. But these "puddles" are the next generation of the scene so hopfully they get their shit together and bring it back to what it was. Without a next generation when this generation dies its all over.  Hopfully by the time these kids are off the drugs or slightly more sober they wont be so sick of meatheads on bar stools making fun of them for their clothes that they will stick around to enjoy the tunes.
 
peace out

only thing i have to add is that it's at least worth
noting that some of these puddle kids will eventually
realized that excessive drug use/abuse isn't really
the thing to do after all and those of them who really
do love the music will stick around and become the
"cool" kids in the bars drinking guinness, IF they
arent turned away from the whole business by a bunch
of people who are acting rude toward them becuase
they are disappointed by it, however understandable
this feeling is. i mean i think not knowing where to
stop is pretty characteristc of being young, although
some take much longer than others to grow up. it's
unfortunate that it takes the more open mind of a
younger person to be open to non-mainstream music and
culture, otherwise maybe more adults would want to
come to parties. for my part, the best times i had at
parties was honestly when i was rolling too hard to be
worried about being cool or not being a dork, during
which times i'm positive anyone not in the same
condition would've found me to be a pretty seriously
dorky mofo (i'll even openly admit to haveing a visor
with a smiley star guy painted on it). fine. but i had
a great time and danced all night and truly enjoyed
myself. then i started getting into spinning and being
critical, and political games and taste ala
picky-ness, and my innocence was lost. now i still
have a great time with no drugs, but it's just a
different kind of good time. i think the rave scene
died because the main thing that made it popular was
that it was new and underground, now that it is no
longer either thing it has changed as people are out
looking for the thing that is still new and
underground, or "hip," or "mature" or whatever the
hell. and also because of mainstream media
misrepresenting it as a drug-market, so that kids who
were really just looking to buy or sell drugs would
know exactly where to go, thus turning it into exactly
that. what about the "hippie festivals?" they still go
on and on, regardless of excessive drug use, is it
just that for most people "raving" was a fad,
something to do to feel like you were "on the edge"
for a minute before getting back to your usual
real-world self? certainly not for me. anyway that's
just my opinion, flush it down the terlet if you wish.

Not in most cases, but at least sometimes.  People leave the scene, new 
people gots to come from somewhere, and the 'cool kids like tom' are 
pretty insular... that is, when's the last time you got someone new to 
come out?  :)

I guess your right.  I just took it to heart to much.  I know your not personally attacking me and respect your insight.  All of the points you made are exactly right and it is bullshit that you have to put up with those things when trying to enjoy your self.  It just upsets me to see the people I represent completly drugged out.  i feel i took some of this anger out on you, and I appologize.  I do dress that way, I do think its fun, and it pisses me that Im automaticly on drugs because of it.  But you are right eight out ten "candy kids" are idiots.

much respect
 
Ps. thanks for a little eye opener

Thats just it. Its not a few. I am not quite sure how you can assume that 
because I am not "candy" that i am on a bar stool snubbing the dancers.

A. They are not in the corner they are in my face. 
B. They approach me about drugs to by and sell.
C. They remind me why i quit raving for years.
D. They are not there to dance they are there to do drugs and only drugs.

These are the bitches we or at least I am classifing as a candy kid. But come 
to mention it i have never met any other kind.

I used to hang out with a bunch of candy kids as did most everyone but at some 
point you have to realise your not 16 anymore. You realise that they are 
directly defining a rave as a drug party to the rest of the world. I am not 
anti-drug either. But for gods sakes candy kids (everyone i have ever talked 
to) are always way over the line. They are the reason the cops, city, venues 
are blocking are access. You want to wear plastic bracelets and have glow in 
the dark binkies and spread the love by having a following of teeth chatters 
tongue chewed up malnurihed kids, then by all means indulge. I am not the 
party nazi. But you are just simply ignoring the facts. 

I don't know you and I am not saying any of this ABOUT you. But from my 
experiance this is the case with candy and raves for that matter.

I am done now,
Paul

Wow, Tom... that's arrogant even for you.

Not all of us are born with the wisdom of a 70 year old, like you.
Hell, look at Bush... and that idiot is running the country.
What are you doing these days that can compare to Dubyah?

that means your taste matured. if youre just a druggie who doesnt 
know shit, youre always going to be. colin claimed that idiots on 
E in the middle of raves can turn into "coll kids" or whatever. 
thats such a rare occurance. id say many more who stick with it 
have turned into the idiots on coke who dont know shit. not really 
much of an improvement if you ask me. 

>excepting physics, there are NEVER any absolutes.

im absolutly the greatest.

stacey wanted the 600 for his set so jessica borrowed it from reese. that's ok because me & darw_n never used the rane before. i'll be playing there more in the future so i'll be controlling that big boy soon.

it was a looong weekend and we've finally just recovered. hanging with sherry & jesse(thanks for the
hospitality!), p-19, and steph c. all weekend was grrreat!!!

maad super huge props to jessica and mike for having me open for stacey pullen!!! i had a blast at
moda even though there could've been more peeps there. playing in that dj booth was definitely an
experience...i love that nexo!!! it was great to see reese, bill, ray, luke, moke, emily, casey,
wayne, ian, braden, and of course darw_n(who was solid for 2+ hrs.)!

thanks to anthony and chris for having me out at fc5! friday night nox tore shit up in that cool
disco room! saturday night heaven was bumpin with pat blaze, react, boompsie, and p-19...i'm not
biased at all! the classic moment was when alex put some porno on their computer monitor when sherry
was spinning...the peeps there were going nuts(except for sherry, lol)! it sukkked that there was no
alcohol allowed upstairs because that turned away lots of peeps...good thing that p-19 smuggled in a
case of natty ice!

You're describing my view, Tom. I am not overly optimistic that every
idiot turns into a total cool guy. I will however say that I have done
some idiotic things in my youth and have changed my ways. Not sure if my
present view of the world, and subsequent method of dealing with it, would
be possible without at least a few mistakes along the way.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Team Shocker

The cross post is because I would like to get feedback about printing
methods (i.e. heat transfer vs silkscreen), places to contact for good
pricing, and input on the look of the graphic. Color is irrelevant
obviously, we made it monochromatic for the first iteration, so changing
it is effortless.

Main list will not accept binary attachments. The different sample
graphics are linked from the site though. Go to www.teamshocker.com if you
want to give input on design. Thanks to all.

Ben

Valid. That was a little over the top. But i stand by the fact that they are 
bad for the scene and our hurting our ability to get venues.

ROFLAO.  This should be the sig quote.

So it had nothing to do with who these people where just that they where alot 
of fun to hangout with and talk to when there serotin levels where through

No teenage drug addicts are met with frustartion and intolerence for obvious 
reasons.

You have the right attitude so respect for that but as long as their are kids 
spaced out of there minds running around looking like cartoon characters from 
a bad anime film our scene will never get respect for being anything other 
then about drugs. 

But your right this thread should die now.

Well thats a SHIT attitude to have.  I have plenty of $$$ And plenty of really nice things but I still choose to dress like a goof not give a shit and party my "candy" ass off.  If you cant sit ther with out making fun of people then go back to your frat house with rest of the meatheads and rip on each other till your cold little heart is content.  Its about love respect and music Nothing else.  If it is about something else for you then you should find a better way to spend you weekend.
 
you are the problem..................

first of all...im no frat boy...second of all...im allowed to have whatever 
attitude i choose...if i choose to rip on a 25 year man who is dressing like 
a 15 year old boy...thats my perogative...if u dont like it...too damn 
bad...if u dont wanna get ripped on...maybe you need to change the way you 
act.

and dont even try to tallk to me about the music...and how into it you are, 
and how into it im not...i spend a good 30hours of my free time(or more) per 
week producing music(on top of holding down a 40h/week job)...thats real 
deditcation to the scene...not dressing like a candy kid til your 25, and 
preaching to ppl who u think dont fit the "true raver" mold...in fact if u 
were a true raver and not a hypocrite, it wouldnt matter to you how anyone 
acts, because you are supposed to accept, respect, and love everyone(even

How appropriate that you're wearing the "holding back the urge to 'buick' everywhere" look.....

Is it true that if you drink enough Miller High Life, you can actually feel the enamel coming off
your teeth?

heres the definitive resource for understanding what im talking 
about: 

idiots: people who just have no business even being involved. they 
dont know shit and are generally around for questionable purposes. 

jokers: idiots who front like they know shit, but they know 
nothing. 

people who are "alright": people who are way into stuff that just 
doesnt deserve people being way into it. 

morons: people who front like theyre into stuff thats very safe to 
like because they have no real opinions.

Dude, your exactly right. Im not trying to start a fight.  Your allowed to think what ever you want. Personally i could give a shit less of what you think of me or any body.  I just dont think its cool to sit ther and rip on people in an environment that is preaching the exact opposite.  You can dress how you want and do what you want and i will respect that.  as far as what you do in your free time thats great and i appreciate it.  But dont act like you know what i do in mine.  Im not PREACHING any thing but acceptence.  
 
I appologize for the frat comment that wasnt cool

bad...if u dont wanna get ripped on...maybe you need to change the way you 
act.

and dont even try to tallk to me about the music...and how into it you are, 
and how into it im not...i spend a good 30hours of my free time(or more) per 
week producing music(on top of holding down a 40h/week job)...thats real 
deditcation to the scene...not dressing like a candy kid til your 25, and 
preaching to ppl who u think dont fit the "true raver" mold...in fact if u 
were a true raver and not a hypocrite, it wouldnt matter to you how anyone 
acts, because you are supposed to accept, respect, and love everyone(even 
cynical, jaded junglists)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} D-licious (Funky charms 5)

I may or may not go to FIRE and I do definately wear candy. I do X on
occassion. And Paul you are the last thing I think of when I think of
normal. No disrespect intended though. I will say this though joking or not,
peaceful as I try to be, as positive as I try to be: I am still a hillbilly
from Painesville and the next time someone says that kinda dumb ass shit to
my face I will stomp the cockiness right out of them. So I may or may not be
at FIRE but if I am I will be wearing candy and ufos... try to touch me.. I
will kick the living shit out of you. Thats not directed specifically at you
paul.. just a general warning.

what"s wrong with our scene.  When did we become divided into candy ravers
and "normal people".  I realize that there are a lot of kids abusing drugs
walking around like zombies.  That is also bad for the scene.  What happened
to the let everyone be attitude?  Bye the way, way to encourage people to go
to FIRE bye telling them you'll burn the candy (real F***IN positive).
Ignorant coments like this are why this scene (though strong ) is falling
apart before our eyes.  I might go to fire, I might wear candy, and I might
have an awsome time, and i might not eat X pills till my pupils are as big
as pennies.  Thank you very much.

if you were alienated by my comments, then you are a retard, and 
probably take your plastic jewelry waaay too seriously

listen mr. smoking big budz, i have lived through the rave trash phase 
of my life and now i get to make fun of all you silly bastards. i've 
earned it. so go stick a pill up your ass.

i was wearing a tasteful sweater and nice pants on friday night if you 
really want to know

>Wow way to be negative and totally trash on and alienate 3/4 of the people that were there.  No offense but who the hell are you, you were after all at a rave.  Just becase someone is dressed a certain way ("rave trash") does not mean they are on drugs or doing anything othere than having a good time, just like you.  Bye the way, what did you wear to the party a three piece suit.  I also did not say that saturday was with out flaws.  I just felt the second half of friday and overall saturday were the best parts.  But this could also be due the fact that my wife and I met a lot of awsome people ("rave trash") on saturday and mostly stayed at heaven and earth.

>>Funky Charms, what an awsome party. I've been every year and once again this year did not dissappoint. The first night I was kind of mad at first at the karma club for the lack of a "rave environment." It seemed like it was just a nght at a Cleveland club. But at Metropolis there were sceens and lights everywere and it was awsome. The second night was even better. The music was hot, and the idea of sperate venues was great. My only complaint would be the Nazi SS security that searched you before going into EVERY spot. I understand that it is for my safety, but it was a little rediculious. They checked shoes and hats everywere and this really held up the lines. I've never been to party were there was no drugs nor probably will I ever be. If someone wants to get something in they will.

Friday night, I added some person named "Methlab" to my friends list on
Friendster.com. No joke -- I think she was that party. I saw this scary,
emaciated-lookin' chick (looked about 45 but was probably only 19), with
the darkest black circles under her eyes. Looked like a fucking refuge who
hadn't eaten in weeks. Made me chuckle.

Anyone doing visuals?  Toss up the man on man action flix and keep 
showing the word Deep.  You will have victory by brainwashing.

Then he'll allow you to touch him Alex.  

And I have the utmost respect for candy kids, without them, plenty 
of promoters wouldnt have been able to charge 20 dollars at the 
door for all local events and even now, they are allowing alot of 
people to break even.

yeah, i'm saying people LEARN, and change, personally
i do it all the time, i mean, i like to have a major
revelation at least a couple times a year, that's how
i got to be so goddamned wise. i know i'm not yer
average honky tho.

LEARNING tom, LEARNING. it happens. maybe not for you.
maybe that opinion comes from your own personal
experience. must suck living in a static universe.
christ if this was the 1400's tom you'd be a
flat-earth advocate. come on, admit it.

actually, i think you have it backwards man. i think YOU have the 
ability to "learn, change, etc" and because you do, you think 
OTHER people do. ive learned and changed, and in that time its 
become obvious to me that not too many other people do. youre the 
one who is mistaking personal experience for reality.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} D-licious (Funky charms 5)

maybe someday tom, you can live in an enclosed
fortress with the four or five miserable elitist scabs
you deem worthy, and you can all sit around and have
one endless ball-massaging pow-wow, and then you won't
have to deal with the rest of us and we wont have to
deal with you. wouldn't that be lovely? oh so i guess
you have to make sure the fortress has windows so you
can still pump your egos up pointing out other
people's supposed shortcomings all day and night. i
mean, you can't be superior without a handy example of
inferiority to cross-reference. 

everybody has the ability to learn, wether they use it
or not. certainly bullying those who don't is not a
very effective means of stimulating them to do so. if
you were really worried about it you would want to act
in a productive way, but really you just like having
people (morons etc) to guage your faux greatness by.
the fact i'm not arrogant is the reason i don't think
that other people are absolutely stupid; if i'm not
superior, then other people aren't inferior, see? if
anything, i'm fortunate, nothing more.

Subject: {pb-cle} Stacy Pullen and Andy James

This is a little late, but I'd like
to thank Jess George and company for a
great time on Saturday. Andy James
and Stacy Pullen put on one of the
sickest dj displays that I have
witnessed for a while.

Stacy Pullen is one of the few dj's
that can get my off my Psy kick for
a minute!

I actually had fun at a Cleveland night
club.

Peace,

hilarious, i make a simple argument, you begin your reply with an 
irrelevant paragrapgh long personal attack. if you had style and 
flair (like me) youd be able to make your argument while 
periodically sprinkling in personal attacks. it makes them much 
more effective. 

>everybody has the ability to learn, wether they use it
>or not. 

but thats not the argument, is it? the argument is whether people 
who have nothing to contribute will ever change. their ability to 
do so (unless theyre mentally retarded or otherwise challenged) 
has nothing to do with their actions. it seems to me that most 
people are pretty consistant in their lives, theres not many 
drastic 180s out there.

he called it my "faux greatness". ha. anyway, why should i be 
worried about what idiots do? i dont give a fuck what they do 
really as long as it doesnt affect me. when it does, i get pissed. 
in the meantime, why should i have faith in them? i shouldnt, and 
i dont.

I, Steve Tsang, officially resign from being a holy saviour

After over 7 years of paying for the sins of so many others:
(Jinx's weed, Garred & Layla's illegal drugs, Favor's opium,
Bush for being a war monger and the cause of much death,
Arnold's gang banging and being an immigrant, My parent's
non compliancy, MJ's affinity with young children, Kobe's
aggressive sexual behaviour, OJ and Scott Peterson's
problem with their ex-spouse), I officially resign!...You will
have to pay for your own sins now!

I want my life back and I want my layla back!...Hopefully,
I will be able to see her by 4/20 resurrection date, Easter
weekend at the Rock the Vote Party!

Most sincerely,

Bryant's Accuser to Testify About Sex Life

Tue Mar 23, 1:16 PM ET

/By JON SARCHE, Associated Press Writer/ DENVER - The woman accusing 
Kobe Bryant of rape will be forced to testify Wednesday about her sex 
life  a move some experts fear could discourage other women from 
reporting sexual assaults.

AFP <http://news.yahoo.com/%27javascript:>


*Slideshow: <http://news.yahoo.com/%27javascript:>* Kobe Bryant 
<http://news.yahoo.com/%27javascript:>




The 19-year-old woman will testify behind closed doors, but media 
members will be at the courthouse to report that she had to answer 
questions from defense attorneys about intimate details of her life. 
"I'm frightened about this decision, only for the fact that families 
will not support victims and survivors to go report because they can now 
say, `Look what happened to so-and-so,'" said Jeri Elster of Los 
Angeles, who was raped in 1992 and has lobbied for changes in the law. 
"It feels like a huge setback for survivors and victims to come." The 
hearing will be held to determine whether details of the woman's sex 
life can be introduced at Bryant's trial. The defense says the 
information should be admitted because it could show that the woman's 
injuries were caused by another sexual partner and that she had a 
"scheme" to sleep with Bryant, possibly to gain the attention of an 
ex-boyfriend. The prosecution fought to limit defense questioning, but 
was rebuffed by the Colorado Supreme Court. The hearing will be the 
first time the woman has faced Bryant since their encounter last summer. 
The Los Angeles Lakers (news 
<http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw>) 
guard has said he had consensual sex with the woman at the Vail-area 
resort where she worked. If convicted, he could get four years to life 
in prison or 20 years to life on probation. No trial date has been set. 
Colorado's rape-shield law, like others around the country, generally 
bars defense attorneys from bringing up information about an alleged 
victim's sex life. The idea is to prevent the defense from depicting the 
alleged victim as a woman of loose morals. Judges, however, can hear 
such testimony in private to determine whether the information is 
relevant and admissible as evidence. Experts said it is not unusual in 
Colorado for an alleged victim to testify in such pretrial hearings. But 
none has attracted such widespread publicity. The woman's name and 
photos of her are splashed almost weekly on the covers of supermarket 
tabloids and can easily be found online. Court filings are posted on the 
Internet. "This is the most harmful misuse of the rape-shield law I have 
ever seen," Wendy Murphy, a former prosecutor who teaches at the New 
England School of Law, said of the Bryant case. "Without it, the defense 
would have nothing to point to to drag her into court." Murphy believes 
many women are watching to see how Bryant's accuser handles what could 
be hours of grueling testimony. "If she makes it, then I think a lot 
more women will come forward and be able to handle what comes out" in 
court, Murphy said. Some experts said there is good reason for the 
alleged victim to testify. "Who knows the facts better as far as her 
history than her?" asked Karen Steinhauser, a former prosecutor and 
visiting professor at the University of Denver School of Law. "I'm not 
sure I would want the judge to decide based on what other people say 
happened." Steinhauser said publicity could actually increase assault 
reports by prompting discussions about acquaintance rape that could help 
remove the stigma. "I hope people see this as a system that, yes, is 
difficult on victims, but if it happened the way she says it happened, 
it's wrong, it's a crime and people need to be held accountable for 
that," Steinhauser said. Nationally, 84 percent of sexual assault 
victims do not go to police, most out of fear people will learn about 
the assault or that they will be blamed for the attack, according to a 
1992 study by the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center 
at the Medical University of South Carolina. Center psychologist Connie 
Best said there are no reliable statistics to determine how a highly 
publicized rape case affects victim reporting rates. But she said 
anecdotal evidence and her own experience suggest that intense publicity 
discourages many victims from coming forward.
"If it's germane to the case, it should be brought out. That's due 
process and there's no problem with that from advocates in the field," 
Best said. "It's having other kinds of information made available" that 
creates a problem.

cheap malt liquor 40's for 2.75... i think they're 
called 'typhoon' or some stormy name... and i had to dig to find 
that dive.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} 40oz

I made it through high school on 45oz colt 45's and mickey's 
40's.... i didnt experience the magnum or OE until ohio state... 
and i even went as far as to buying 12 packs of 12oz cans of 
magnum... which only disappointed me because it obviously was made 
to be put into a 40 oz bottle, not an aluminum can.

Subject: {pb-cle} 40oz

the best place is this little deli on penn.  can't remember the name.
but you can go in there on sunday afternoon, but a 40 and the best chicken
you've ever had.  wouldn't take grandma there after church, but a fun outing
for the kids.  the lady working the register looks like an 80 year old
transvestite
person.

good chicken.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FC 5 was the bomb!

there was the korean place under where hypervinyl used to be on oakland 
ave...

they were always skunked though.  but for us freshman it was a gold mine.

even the cops didn't care

Cop Sitting at table looking at us: "Aren't you going to card them?"

Korean Owner: "Why would I card them, they're not 21"

we soil our pants, cop laughs, owner laughs, bags our 40s, hands them to us 
and we run out of there as fast as we can

After laughing for a while, you can then put him in the elavator so whenever 
anyone tries to go to the elavator they'd see him and like run around and

don't make me laugh, oops, too late. anyway i don't
really put that much time into meticulously
constructing my "attacks" in order to be more
effective. not saying there's anything wrong with it,
but arguing isn't an art to me. i just argue with you
because everything you say seems to demand it. are you
actually denying that you're an elitist? i don't think
you should do that.

i like to hear myself speak and see myself type. i mean i even 
save some of the better ones just because of the level of 
brilliance of my arguments. 

>why DO i even

really to be honest i like arguing with idiots because they dig 
themselves into holes. it makes it so much fun to fuck with them. 
as for why youd wanna argue with me, i have no clue. youre not 
doing yourself any favors and as i have no shame and a gigantic 
ego you can never make me feel anything.

youre like the william s burroughs of cracker techno.

the only interest i have in injuring your interests is my hope and 
dream that all cracker techno producers will just die one day so 
youll have nothing else to play. 

i wish youd at least give me a little of your email that i was 
replying to so i could have any idea what i meant when i said 
things. i cant remember all the silly shit i have to direct at 
you.

Yep, got in one on the way home from my morning job.  We were on our 
way home and the semi in front of us stopped (it's at delta for all 
you streetstuckyans) and then started to back up, and back up, and 
back up.  Horn's blaring, must not have heard it.  We couldn't back 
up because there was a car behind us.  Everyone's ok, i'm just a 
little sore and my mom was a lot sorer (she has a bad back to begin 
with).  The bumper doesn't really looked dented, but it's scracted 
really good (it's a ford escort (no, not my car)).  Then the truck 
driver was really arrogent and said that it would just rub out.  So 
then the guy behind us stopped and really let him have it like "How 
the hell you could do something like that" etc...  So that guy left 
us his contact info as a witness.  So, yeah, I'll still more than 
likely be at third eye, but don't fret if I'm not there :)  Going to 
doc's now to get my back looked at, typical mother freaking out 
stuff.

I'm sorry for saying that to the more intelligent DJs that make chart
topping tunes, but some of us lower forms of ravers just want to have
fun.......    I bet you order your pizza sometimes with extra cheese!  : P
And who can turn down a slice of cheese cake?!  AND DON'T GIVE THAT BS ABOUT

Subject: {pb-cle} This Saturday in the 'burgh

yeah, so if you missed [mark]'s post earlier this week, I know a 
couple of people that were planning on hitting up the jeckyl and 
hyde on the south side for [mark]'s birthday celebration, bitch.  
If you're in town, you should swing by and give the wishes to the 
guy, just don't be that guy.  Bring your pimp hats.

Tom's sister has a silkscreening kit.  For Christmas, she made me, Tom,

Squarepusher
With Cassetteboy and Jonny J

>"The perfect amalgam of beatific melodies and percussive chaos"The Guardian

Leading U.K. electronica innovator Tom Jenkinsona.k.a. Squarepusherhas at last overcome his phobia about air travel and is set for a series of much-anticipated U.S. tour dates. 

http://www.wexarts.org/pa/index.php?area=pa&eventid=887&featureid=887
 
Tickets are only $16!!! His new release 'Ultravisitor' is the most incredible electronic music album I've ever heard. The live recording of songs that make up the album indicates that his performance will be something none of us have witnessed before... his integration of live instrumentation w/ electronics is as innovative as it gets. 
 
 
...and on the flipside, Kraftwerk will be performing live at the Ricoh Stadium in Toronto on April 23rd. It's considerable that it may be their last show ever in this region of the United States and I think there are only two other shows booked in North America. The tickets for better seating are $47.50 and are probably very well worth it. 
 
http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/10003784F0BDBF31?brand=&artistid=880898&majorcatid=10001&minorcatid=201
 
 
Is anyone else planning on attending these? I can't imagine them being less than stellar and know that some of you must be just as excited as I am...

Subject: {pb-cle} Crackin' on 91.1 FM tonight 10:00pm-12:00am

Quick heads up...I'll be covering the Darkfield Imagery show on 91.1 
FM tonight from 10:00pm to 12:00am.  DI typically leans towards the 
harder side of techno and industrial.  So my set will be some harder 
beats...

Marco Carola, Herbert's Around the House (did you know Herbert get's 
cracker??), a stack of new releases from Underground Resistance and 
Submerge, Eddie Richards, Scan7, and a few surprises are stuffed into 
my record bag.

When your driving tonight tonight heading out in Cleveland please tune in!

Jassen

Subject: {pb-cle} New to the list


Hello,

I'm new to the list and just want to say hi to everyone in the Pittsburgh /
Cleveland Area.  A little bit about myself: I'm 31 and have been involved in
the rave scene for about 14 years.  I currently live in the San Francisco
Bay Area and my raving and djing experience has been amazing and fortunate
to participate on both the east and west coasts of the US.  So, yeah as I've
just mentioned, I am a DJ, and since there tends to be a lot of djs out
there in the world, I'll just say my style at the moment lends more towards
the Progressive House genre, although I don't care to be tagged to any one
particular style or genre, I'll play whatever fits my mood.   I hope to get
involved with the discussions here, and learn a lot more about some of the
scenes outside of my area.  See what's happening and what exactly gets all
the lovely people in the Pittsburgh-Cleveland Area excited, which will
broaden my scope since I think everyone here is outside of the scene I'm
currently active in.   

I love to share my music and what gets me excited.  I hope that you can
check out some of my Mixes, give me some feedback, say hi, or maybe
introduce yourself to me.

Feel free to poke around on my website:

http://jl.halogen.org

Hugs!

Jason Lee

Subject: {pb-cle} weekend review

This is one the best weekends I've had for a while.  Even with the 
fact that I got into a fender bender friday and that I have to work 
today.

Friday my camera was deliverd, but because I was taking my mom to the 
med center (she's fine, btw) they couldn't leave it.  So I drove all 
the way down below downtown akron, in rush hour, to the fedex center 
to get it (was a 28 mile drive, one way).  Anyway I had a few hours 
to get a handle of the controls before heading out to third eye.  
Lots of great music there, wasn't really that crowded, but there was 
still a good number of people that showed up.  Left a little early 
because I was tired, but not before getting some really good pics 
(and realizing the red eye reduction and AI auto focus is little 
sketchy at times).

Saturday, after figuring out road runner was down I spent all day 
detailing my car (btw, the mr clean auto dry thingy does work, as 
long as you remember to spray the final rinse stuff everywhere) and 
then headed out to Fire.  Another great time, although odd there were 
a few people that though I didn't like DnB, thought people knew that 
I listen to everything.  Plus I ran into a buddy from college, which 
was really odd.  Anyway, the music was great.  Even the MC's, which 
usually get on my nerve, were good.  I guess the sound was too good 
since they kept blowing a breaker till they just turned off some of 
the lights.  And of course got some more pictures.  I'll probably get 
them all up tonight after work, once I get rid of the ton of pictures 
I took of Jes testing with the different aperature and shutter 
speeds.

I was thinking of going to 10 hour 10 djs, but since the earliest I 
could get down there would be around 8:00 and then have to leave 
around 12:00, not sure if I should bother.  I'll see by tonight if I 
want to go or not.  would be another oportunity to use my camera :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fire

The night went off smooth with the exception of the breakers blowing (untill
we ended reworking our shit to cope with clubs drastic electrical system)
and of course the dollar drafts ending early and under 21 cover tacked on.
The club owner pulled this shit on us at the last minute and when I
confronted him about it, though it too late by then, he just gave me some BS
excuse. My appologies for those that were affected by either and I tried to
resolve the problem when people asked me about it. The bright side of the
under 21 cover is that it wasn't 5, like Peabodies or several other venues
manage to omit from adverts ALL the time.

Anyways, for some positive plugs, everything else ran smooth. 5-0 was
waiting outside patiently to bite on something, but I confronted them
several times throughout the night and they were playing fair. It was really
nice to seem so many people packed into a joint to hear some good music, and
especially of the rarity of all DNB and NOT at any of the ussual clubs
around Cleveland. Good vibe doesn?t come with buffed up name or bragging
about your 80k watt Turbo sound. Mucho respect to all those people that
helped in their own ways, including all the performers for stepping out and
rinsin' it. All in all, I hope everyone seemed to have a good time and
hopefully we can do this again soon, though perhaps not the same venue
(*cough-HiveOnApril30th-cough*).

Later,

That rotary rane is sick.  It has 2 different pieces.  It would be good to
check them out online before using the unit as its unconventional by todays
standards.

Techno City Records(Detroit) Presents "Cinco"


Featuring.....


Andy James - BerettaMusic/Soniktexture/Goahead/Digital Goodtime/Koala Tea - Cleveland, OH
www.berettamusic.com ~ www.goaheadproductions.com ~ www.digitalgoodtime.com ~ www.koala-tea.com 


"Inspired by earlier electronic groups like Kraftwerk, New Order, Orbital, The Shamen, 808 State and Underworld, Andy James first started going to parties in 1998. Some of the DJs he saw that year included Adam Beyer, Marco Carola, Joel Mull, Christian Smith, Cari Lekebusch and Claude Young. At the time he had no idea who they were, but the records they were playing and the way they were mixing them definitely had an impact on him. Techno was infused in his blood and he needed a release. Andy started spinning records in 1999 and hasn't looked back since. 

Always known for rocking the hard and funky techno beats, Andy has risen to become one of the Midwests hardest working techno DJs. In 2000, after only spinning for 6 months, he competed and placed second out of eight DJs at the Atomic Battle of the DJs held at the Metropol, Pittsburghs largest club -- 800 people were in attendance for the finals! Andy has played alongside Stacey Pullen, Frankie Bones, David Hollands, Punisher, Barry Weaver, Scott & Robbie Hardkiss, Shawn Rudiman, and Dan Curtin to name a few. Currently, Andy is playing at various weeklies, club events, parties and radio shows in and around Ohio, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and various other cities around the East Coast and Midwest. With his 13 released mixes, Andy has caused a serious buzz around the Midwest, East Coast and on the Internet. Andy's fast-paced mixing skills and unique technical style on 3 decks have allowed his DJ schedule to grow by the minute.

Andy's talents extend beyond the turntables, as he has been producing original techno tracks on his own and with partner Don Lisy under the name Moonplastic since 2000. Just like Andy's DJ sets, a Moonplastic track is best described as powerful peak time floor-shaking, fist-pumping techno with sweeping breakdowns and cleverly programmed loops and beats. In 2002, they released 100 copies of their first demo EP on their own to techno DJs, producers and labels in Europe and America. Although nothing got signed, the feedback was very positive and it pushed them to take their productions to the next level. Andys energy has been consumed in his many DJ bookings, but also in the studio with Don preparing for techno world domination. Keep on the lookout for solo tracks and collaborations to be released on BerettaMusic (Detroit) and on Moonplastic's forthcoming label Soniktexture in 2004."

This was dope, dope, dope. 
 
Everyone played absolutely incredible sets on the HeadRush stage. 
 
The sound system was KICKIN' and the new lighting rig was great!
 
>>From what I could tell the DnB rooms and the lounge were going off, too.

 
Many thanks to the DJs, Metropolis, and Spundae and True for hosting
this event.

Ryan Papa. Friday April 2.
 
Maybe you remember the buzz he created last time he was here. Maybe you
don't.
 
Either way, get your ass to Cloud 9 on Friday. It's just five bucks.
 
There WILL be an afterparty for this event where Ryan will continue to
play. Details for that afterparty will be announced at the Cloud 9
event.

Subject: {pb-cle} Magnetrixx Interview/By Ari D 

by Ari D (Goahead, Cleveland)
questions/comments to arid@djcentral.com
(Note: re-posting and forwarding of this message is totally encouraged!)

MAGNETRIXX is made up of Stefan Lewin and Heike Fahrmeyer hailing from
Cologne, Germany. Their music is futuristic, tribal, mysterious, yet with a
very positive vibe  but most of all, it is deeply hypnotic! With the
release of the album Phase Shift on Tatsu last year, other releases on
Medium, Leviathan and other labels, as well as on scores of compilations,
they have joined the ranks of some of the most sought-after German
progressive psytrance producers and live acts on the international circuit
today. They took the tribes on a mind-warping journey through the forests at
Four Quarters in Artemis, P.A at last summer's Gaian Mind open air festival.
Now, they return to the states to play New York and Cleveland the last
weekend in April.  They will be playing a lot of unreleased material that
will form their upcoming new album, due out at the end of the year.  Some
insights then, from the pair that captured the imagination of the East Coast
tribes last summer and is sure to recapture it again this spring


Where are you both, and what is going on there these days?

We are living in Bornheim, a small town nearby Cologne, Germany.

A big scene is here around our location (in a wide range), that means, we
have lots of labels, artists, parties here, so there is a lot of activity
around music, especially electronic music styles.


Where have you been playing in the past couple of month?  Any stories from
especially great events or locations?

We played in Budapest/Hungary short time ago, and it was great, the people
on this party and the "vibe" was very nice.


So you're coming to America again soon.  What are your impressions from last
year's Gaian Mind open air festival in Pennsylvania?  The US trance movement
must seem very 'underground' coming from Europe...

It was very underground for us, indeed. But not in the meaning, that it was
"underdeveloped", instead, we had the feeling that it was very close to the
"roots" of all this, which gave us very spiritual impressions. It was like
everything has one good vibe. This is a sharp contrast to the usual parties
here. So maybe the question is whether development like it happened with the
western-European-party-scene, especially the German party-scene is good for
keeping and taking care of this spiritual vibe only We dont mean some
esoteric thing with it, I just mean the awareness of what it means to have a
good party together, and that its not just stupid unconscious consumption.

For example, here (Germany), you see lots of parties, which seem just
commercial. We think, it depends on both, the people who visits a party (Im
talking about their awareness) and the organizers of the party. We think the
intention should be to have a "place of freedom", which not only means, that
You just can consume all kinds of fun there. A party is no Disneyland. It is
a place where people come together (should be at least) and have a nice time
but having in mind the things, which have to come together to provide such
an event. We hope, our description is clear. :c) So, if we take the Gaian
Mind Festival for example, there, we always felt this "being together" and
"awareness" vibe. One very important point is the awareness of the
surrounding nature. We think, it is hard to find it in that way and
consequence, as we found it at Gaian Mind Festival. Everybody was looking to
keep the place tidy. It was really nice to see, and we saw a big difference
to the party people here (the most of them). So, underground can be better
sometimes than a commercial "fun-consumption-event" :c)


To those who have not yet heard your music (or even trance in general) at
all, how do you usually describe your sound?

Perhaps its an good way to describe it as riding in a train, hearing the
rhythmical noises caused by the wheels on the rails, looking out of the
window and watching the beautiful unseen landscapes of a weird nature which
changes all the time, sometimes repeating just a bit different, (sometimes I
have a feeling like that) or zooming into a fractal. One can always observe
similar structures, but they are not the same, and interesting things are
falling in the eye. We also would describe it as deeply hypnotic. I hope
this is getting the point across. :c) (its hard to describe our own
creations)


If you can, describe for us your creative approach in the studio.  What gets
your "creative juices" flowing?

Ok, I (Stefan) will speak for myself here. There are many things which
inspire me. Mostly the things have nothing to do with music :c) So, its
synthetic :c)  For example wonderful inspiring sources are all kinds of
sciences, especially cosmology, the structures in the universe, the
macroscopic and microscopic ones, quantum physics, and Im also very
interested in the physics of sound: neurology, psychoacoustics, ( and
sometimes I try to use some phenomena in our tracks which are not used so
often in music ). I try to go more and more into the secrets of "sound". It
is highly interesting and sometimes very inspiring. Also (keeping in mind
that "All is one" and "One is all") Im getting inspired a lot by the beauty
of the nature.

All the things together are the source for my inspiration. It is not
separate in my mind. Everything can be discovered everywhere. (Isotrophy) (
I hope it doesnt sound esoterical, its not intended, its just that nature
is like that )

I hope the description above will not cause misunderstandings, Im just a
very "open-eyed"-freak for such things, and its the main source of my
inspiration, what can I say...  :c) But of course, Im also inspired from
other kind of music, as jazz, classical music and of course psytrance
itself.


How did you first hook up with the Tatsu label?  Anything exciting going on
there?

Its hard to explain, I just met Laureth, he was the A&R from Tatsu before
and he liked one of my first released tracks, and asked me to do an album on
Tatsu. and I said yes. :c) So, after some years, now, the situation looks
different there, and Laureth isnt the A&R of Tatsu anymore. Now D-Nox is
A&R there and I feel that our musical styles (mine and the style of Tatsu)
are very different in this moment. I always try to do different things,
maybe I wont reach this goal, but at least I try. And at the moment, I feel
(we feel) differently, musically speaking. So, Im not so much in touch with
Tatsu these days. So lets see what the future will bring. :c)


Do you play a lot of unreleased material during your live sets?

Depending on when we had the last releases more or less. So, at the moment,
yes, we play many unreleased tracks.


Can you name any all-time classics that could define your musical
influences?

To mention just a few: Johann Sebastion Bach, Modest Mussorgsky, Eroll
Garner, Jean Michel Jarre, Kraftwerk, Pink Floyd,  Software (an German
electronic group in the 80s), Isao Tomita, Depeche Mode, Prodigy..........


Tell us about Morganixx, your side project.  Do you explore a different
sound or idea there?

At first, we founded Morganixx because we tried to make more
melody-influenced tracks, where many ideas came from Heike (Morgana,
therefore the name Morganixx) But later, all got more and more mixed up, so
we cant really say, what the difference now is, because Heike is involved
in the Magnetrixx tracks as well, so some Magnetrixx tracks are also
melodic. (till now, at least a little bit :c) )


Is there life after the "Phase Shift" album?  When can we expect more
Magnetrixx releases?

I hope we dont have to wait so much longer until the next album will be
released, maybe at the end of this or the beginning of the next year. We are
working on it already. At least there will released an 12" vinyl in April on
AP-Records, containing 2 new tracks.


On the personal side, are you two related in any way?   Just curious :-]

Stefan: Yes :c)  Heike and me are a couple and we do most things together
(even playing live heheh) and Heike is managing most things for me too,
which helps me a lot to develop myself and Im very grateful for it. :c))


Thank you both and we look forward to your visit!

You are welcome :c)

Heike & Stefan.

I've been told that the American DJ ones that are modeled after the Pioneers are absolute crap, and
to stay away at all costs.

Are you looking for "playing out" purposes or for "messing around at home" purposes?

Pretty much at home but occasionally we get something going and tend to use my 
equimpent out and about.

Money isn't a real issue I just don't want to pay more for something because 
of a name brand. If I have to pay 500+ fine but the cheaper the better with 
as little loss to quality as possible.

I saw some newmark unit that was like 300 but the reviews where awful then 
from there all I saw was the pioneer and denon units. Quite a price jump.

The stanton dual decks are reasonably priced and at least have seamless

I think the Pioneer CDJ800s are at Guitar Center for around $600 with a $100 
rebate.  They work just as well as the 1000s minus a few features here and 
there (usually when it comes to sampling and looping) that most DJs probably 
aren't going to use to their full potential.

You can also probably get a good used CDJ1000 for $500-600 as well - esp 
with people trading up to the CDJ-1000 mk2 & the yet to be released DZ-1200 
from Technics in May.

I just had a phone interview for a job I am horribly overqualified for.
Then, in an act of sheer desperation I emailed an old boss of mine,
congratulated him on his big promotion, and was sure to mention that I'd
just sent a resume and cover letter to his company. I know it's really
called "networking," but somehow it *feels* like brown-nosing. Whatever
it's called, I've been reduced to it.

If you bust out the bendy straw I bet he could do it in under 2 seconds.

Yeah, Bill got a video of it. Dave did 7 ounces in under 6 seconds. I don't
know whether I should be proud or very, very afraid ...

That doesn't even seem possible.  The straw would collapse before you could 
create enough suction to do that.  Where's the physics majors out there? find 
out what the flow rate would be to drink 7 oz in < 2 seconds.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} JOBS jobs JOBS

Lot of job posts today; figured I'd toss this out.

I worked for a company near Washington DC (IMAKE, in Bethesda, MD). 
They're interviewing for my replacement this week and next.  Java 
Servlets, Tomcat, Oracle.  They've hired Physics majors with heavy math 
(no code) backgrounds before, so if you have code skills and a degree, 
wouldn't hurt.  It's a financial company, fairly high stress 
environment, excellent pay raises.

The new company I work for, still near Washington DC (in Potomac, MD) is 
hiring for almost the same thing.  Java Servlets, Tomcat, Oracle. 
Degree is unnecessary, but code-samples and good work experience are 
key.  Less stress; bring your dog into work on friday, jeans, t-shirt. 
Also hiring for interns; college juniors/seniors with Java experience 
and/or college grads with general OOP experience.

Both jobs are <15 miles northwest of downtown DC, which is both good and 
bad.  :-/

Uhm, I'm guessing you've never chugged a bottle this way...

Frat-physics tell you that if you bend the straw over the mouthpiece it lets
air in while your mouth is still on the bottle, so it's not "glug glug" but
rather it just flows out freely... Not as much foam, no air bubbles needed,
it keeps the bottle from vacuum resistance.

It's the same as bonging a beer, without the bong.

I didn't mean to drink it with a straw, you just use the straw to let air
into the bottle.

Ohh ok, I thought you meant drink it through the straw.  That makes sense.  
Hmm... may just try that and maybe I would actually be able to chug a beer 
since I haven't been able to because of all the gluging.

have you ever had a conversation with one of those people who just do NOT know how to end said
conversation?

they just keep reiterating the same shit over and over and over.

there's a woman here at work who does this.

ten minutes ago, she had a conversation with the person at the desk next to mine, then, as if there
were a lead wall between us, came over and had the EXACT SAME FUCKING CONVERSATION WITH ME...

i even attempted to preempt the conversation by saying "yep, got it...you have blah blah" so she
wouldn't start talking, and she went into the tirade ANY FUCKING WAY!!!

and, to make matters worse, she's a "close talker". she doesn't need to be that close to me. or
anyone.

That's it...I'm leaving.

Trying working the help desk at an ISP, hear stuff like that all the time.  
Intermixed with guys that scream in the phones, people that breath into the 
phones, eat while talking on the phone (which is REALLY annoying).  Then 
people calling up because their printer isn't working, like that has anything 
to do with their internet connection.  And they even say "I know this doesn't 
have anything to do with the connection, but <insert name of manufacturer's> 
support sucks."  As much as I appreciate at that, I have other calls from 
people thinking they crash the internet to call, foo. (yes, I actually did 
have one think they "locked up" the internet).

I've been home dizzy with a fever all day and I can't remember whether
or not I posted that there's going to be an afterparty for the Ryan Papa

Well, there will be. 
 
Get your groove on at Cloud 9 for $5. We'll announce the afterparty
location at that event.

Thumbs up on the axis 8, the axis 9 is great too, it's touch sensative, etc.

If you really wanna be pimp, it's not cheap. I've been eyeing a Numark CDX
for a while now... CD Audio + Mp3 support and it's built on a TTX-1. Just
p1mp.

for sure! anyone who missed Ryan the last time he was in town......DO NOT MISS HIM THIS TIME!!!!!!  and more important, make sure you go to the afterparty!!!!!   Last time he was in town he ended up getting back on the decks late night way after his set and played an amazing 7 hour set.  This guy has got some major talent and this is definitely something you're not gonna want to miss.  check it.  i can't wait!
 
whoa-  something weird i just thought about.  last time he was in town i stopped by mercury lounge first to see tortured soul.  well tortured soul is in town again this weekend on saturday for nitty gritty...weird coincidence.

Well, there will be. 

Get your groove on at Cloud 9 for $5. We'll announce the afterparty
location at that event.

Jamie, Candice et al....Can I get a vouch for Ryan?

ahem, that is *my* hard drive, mr. trout, and Darude was downloaded after
we kept hearing it at a Pirate game.  then some private jokes ensued which
are none of your business.
that said, that tshirt is rad.  I'd sport it, for sure.

Oh, here, I'll clarify this before you terds get all excited.
Downloaded by me:
Annie Lennox
Blink 182 (just that one song.  It is, as Chris Rock would say, a
catchy-ass song)
Cher
Chicago
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young
Edwyn Collins
Elton John
Foreigner
Live
Marlene Dietrich
Moby
Neil Young
OMD
Simple Minds
Sinead O'Connor (sorry, I don't know one girl who can resist that song)
The Avalanches
Third Eye Blind
Thunderclap Newman
Toad the Wet Sprocket
Tonic
Verical Horizon

I do indeed have guilty pleasures/bad taste and that is precisely why mp3s
were invented, my friends.
And Trout, I'm offended that that screen cap is entitled "Tom's Drive." 
Mine!

i'm sorry for assuming that when i was looking at tom's soulseek files 
that i assumed it was his drive. how silly of me. i'll never assume that 
people put their own data on their own drives.  but tom did have those 
files listed under his soulseek name and there is no mistaking that.

should i relabel it something more fun. like toms loves slaves drive? or 
better yet toms masters drive? hahahaa!!!!!
(theres a pun sort of in there for the PC geeks. didn't intend it, but 
it happened)

Well,...

I got to Ohio on Wednesday night, and got to see my mother in which I =
hadn't seen since November. Opened some Christmas presents because I =
always make plans to come out but never can since our bills here at the =
house kicked our asses this year. Called up a few friends I hadn't seen =
in a long time as well, and got to see them pretty much most of the =
week. It makes me miss home soooo much knowing that I have good people =
there that still think about me as if I were still home. =3D) I also =
went to surprise a few people and let them know I was in town early but =
showing up at Brents weekly ... down at Touch. Never been there, and was =
surprised to see Reese bartending!.. I always thought you were younger =
for some reason. Must be that slick ass hair look that you pimp all the =
time ;) I also had a nice time down there guys. I hope that night goes =
super well...

Thursday night we hung out at my moms bar in Elyria. Had an AWESOME time =
there and watching a 50 year old chick tell the biggest guy in the place =
she was gonna kick his ass..   freakin awesome.

Friday night played some tunes with Dez at Rewind? I forget this =
weeklies name. Seems like an interesting venue..  I left kinda early =
because I had been tired the entire week and just wanted to rest some =
where quiet for once.=20

Saturday night.... oh my goodness. Got to the venue to see a cop sitting =
directly in front of the place. Thought that was kinda odd, but I think =
they were gonna bust a huge rave or something.. haha. It seemed that =
people were pouring into the night since 10:30 which was awesome cause I =
wasnt sure what to expect from the night at all. Regardless we all would =
have rocked out anyways.. hehe.=20

Got to see a nice chunk load of people I hadnt seen in years. Most of =
them didnt even know I moved out of state, so it was awesome to see =
those guys. I also have to say that every dj that played at Fire, =
seriously TORE the freakin roof off that place. I don't think Ive ever =
seen a crowd get as hype as they did since 98 esp it being an all dnb =
event. The crowd as hype jumping around, throwing water at the MC's the =
entire night, screaming for rewinds... etc.. you name it.. and it was =
going on. I really felt good and it put myself in a better mood about =
the dnb scene all together.=20

I also have to say thanks to everyone I met that night, that gave me =
props for coming out to play. It really meant a lot what each and =
everyone of you said to me, and its what keeps me going within the =
scene. I also want to thank Rudy, Baxter, Brent, and Majestic for being =
champs as well. I really felt as if we were all banging out at Pressure =
again, and it was SUPER great to see all of you in one night playing =
records. If it wasnt for you guys, I wouldnt be hanging around as well. =
All of you did a super job and I was super impressed the entire night. I =
hope we can all get together and do this again!...

Thanks to George and Alex for putting on this event, and promoting your =
asses off. I saw you guys the entire night working your butts off trying =
to keep things in order, and for the most part they did stay ok (from =
what i saw). I do have to appologize for being silly at one point =
though,..  for the most part, I didnt get super drunk like everyone =
wanted me to. Ive been growing out of that phase lately... AND for =
screaming for Chris Hardman when the sound / lights went down. I just =
wanted to be a dick and scream for his ass cause I knew there were a few =
of you there that would of had a laugh. =3DP  If Im not mistaken, I =
think Trout said Bill got it on video tape... CLASSIC!.. hehe.

I also came home with a digi cam in my record box that isnt mine. I have =
a clue to who's it is.. maybe, but please email me if anyone lost a =
camera. Ill be glad to return it to its owner some how. =3D)

Also..  Koala Tea is putting the sets up on the site from this night. =
I'll speak for most of the djs thru out the night on this one...   =
During my set (atleast), there was a guy standing on the stage who kept =
bumping the tables with his ass more than a few times. It was like =
"house party" where I had to really punch the guy in his back to get him =
off the stage. SO, this leaves the recording with a few bumps and =
scratches on the set. I know I did it once on accident to Brent and =
Majestic (sorry!!!!)...=20

I know I might have left a few things out, and Im sure Ill recap on =
those later. But again, THANK YOU!!! and Im really really glad to see =
everyone that night.

Thanks!!

Jea Leigh

how the new SATA drives that are coming out handle it if at all. since

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} New shirt for Tom

there is a new rule in california
that any company doing business
with the cali state government cannot
use the master/slave conventions in
their technical documentation or they
will lose their contract

this refers not only to hard drives
but also to other mechanical/electrical
stuff, i saw some examples that involved
networking and MIDI i think

so that's that, political corectness for ya

Don't even start on the LSD urban legends. Or, rather, sure, start that

Duuuude, that would be a challenge. I thought 6 seconds was good enough. 
I'll have to try the straw trick next time.

Subject: {pb-cle} Bassline Mag support, issue #2, etc.

Hey everyone-
Just wanted to thank you all for your encouraging
comments regarding Bassline. For those of you who know
how many hours I've sat at this computer working on
the first issue, it's finally paid off! It's been so
hectic, not to mention very stressful at times!, but
Lindsey and I have pulled it together and that's why I
wanted to post that we are definitely looking for more
help! 

We are planning for issue #2 and are looking for some
writers and photographers, as well as advertising
sales reps. This magazine is for us!! And although we
won't be able to produce issues every month and review
every party, if you do have an idea that you think we
could use, please let Lindsey or me know! We are
aiming for August to get Issue 2 out, so the later the
event, the better!

We'll be sending out updated media kits, so if you
know anyone interested in advertising, please email us
at contactbassline@hotmail.com. Our Web site should be
up soon, and we'll let everyone know about that when
the time comes!

Finally, we are interested in having a couple benefit
club nights to promote the mag and raise money for the
next issue. Anyone who would like to discuss this
further (possibly a promoter in Ohio or Pbgh) that
currently holds a night, please email us at
contactbassline@hotmail.com or call 937.360.6316.

So,look for Bassline this coming week at Milk Records,
Columbus tomorrow, and Cincy by Saturday and other
venues which I will post again. Thanks again for all
your support, and if you're down for our cause, we
want your involvement!

Stephanie*C

P.S.
Even after proofing the first issue a million times
there's still a couple minor errors. Please forgive me
... or maybe you won't even notice ;) I caught a
couple in this month's URB. ha.

Subject: {pb-cle} Open Decks, from what I understand

I guess Bumpers sports bar on Bethel rd. got a makeover and now has open
decks on wednesday nights. It's called 1138 now, I'm not sure of the
details, but I'll be there packing heat, and probably early, since I'm on
call at work. I'll see if I can't get a flyer or something for next week so
I can be absolutely sure about it.

Oh yeah... I should mention this is on Bethel Rd., in Columbus. It's on the
north side of the street, somewhere around where Kenny rd. meets Bethel,
it's right next door to the Refectory (probably the best restaurant in
town).

Ditto this.  Ryan's style goes anywhere from
tech-house to prog to breaks, and he is a master at
dropping samples and loops over his mixes, and has a
flair for interesting track selection.  In addition
he's an interesting guy with a great sense of humor,
which makes him all that much more fun to hang out
with/listen to.

I was looking at that unit online. But read some bad reviews. Is that the unit 
you showed me on saturday? Is there anything you don't like about it?

How does pitch on adjust on a cd unit compare to a TT? I have heard really bad 
stories like its almost impossible to get a dead lock.

What city are you looking for a job in? Pittsburgh? Does the statement
that you can do pretty much anything mean that you also aren't trained to
do any specific job function? If you are, you might be in luck. I've been
getting a LOT more calls recently. 5 this week alone. Got a resume?

Also, you may want to submit your resume to a potential employment
opportunity from a different email address   ;-P

Tried searching for tom cox, no results.

Another favorite odd place, urbandictionary.com.  Was looking up interweb for 
the heck of it and then decided to know what the internet is:

http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=internet

72 definitions :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ FRANKIE BONES ON ABC @ 10PM 04/01 PETER JENNINGS "ECSTACY RISING"

Actually, I just got this email and I don't really know why..but, anyhoo, if
it's of interest to anyone :

This message was forwarded to Dancesafe from Richard Doblin MD, E.D. of the
Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies:

Friends,

I'm writing to ask if you could help promote two different
presentations of information about MDMA that ABC will be airing on April 1.

At 10 PM *(Eastern?)*, Peter Jennings will present an hour-long documentary
called Ecstasy Rising. This will be an excellent telling of the history of
MDMA/Ecstasy and will seriously challenge government propaganda about MDMA.
For more information, the ABC press release can be found at:
http://www.maps.org/mdma/jennings040104.html

Also, in a major triumph that has just come together over the last
few days, ABC's World News Tonight at 6:30 PM will present a feature story
(90-120 seconds) about MAPS' study of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD. This
will be a compelling account of the need for research into a potentially
useful treatment. These shows will help to some extent counteract the $51
million in
free ad space that Comcast has donated over the next three years to the
Partnership for a Drug-Free America exclusively for anti-Ecstasy ads.

Thanks for your help,

Rick Doblin

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CD Decks...

pitch control on cd players is identical to turntables...except some cd 
players have adjustable pitch rates...a technic turntable for example has a 
range of +/- 8%....some cd players have a default range of +/- 10% or 
+/-16%...but most of them can be set for +/- 8%...the ppl that say its hard 
to lock pitch probably are expecting the scale to be the same as a 
tech...but most cd players default to +/- 10%...so it isnt what they are 
used to...so they talk trash about how cd players arent as good or 
whatever...because they expect the end of the scale to be 8...but its really 
10...so it fucks them up...and since the dj is never wrong...it must mean cd 
players are inferior.

none of that applys to old gemini or numark decks(like 5 years old)...alot 
of those had super funky pitch controls...i remember gemini's cdj500 clone 
had a super funky pitch...it moved in incriments of +/-5...thats obviously 
horrible...but any cd deck built in the last 3 years will probably have a 
fully linear pitch control.

i dont think it matters how much of a legitimate use there may or may not be 
for MDMA...the gov't is never gonna re-legalise it...they make too much 
money on its prohibition...and have scared the general populace to death 
with it...not only that...if mdma was re-legalised...how would they control 
it?  ppl would still have clandestine MDMA labs....and bad tabs would still 
get out...kids would still be retards and take 10 at once and still OD.

lets face it...if there was a referundum on the ballot to re-legalise 
MDMA...how many ppl do you actually think would vote in favor of it?  
regardless of how many thousands or even millions of ppl would vote in favor 
of re-legalisation...there would be at least 10x more against it because of 
the gov'ts 20 year scare campaign against it...plus for every raver or club 
goer that votes..there are 10 more "normals" that vote.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Thai Summary

I had a suprising number of responses to my question, so I wanted to send
this to the whole list. Thanks to everyone for the suggestions.

Adam Oliveri wins the grand prize for identifying a restaurant located in
downtown Pittsburgh's cultural district. What's he win? A steaming hot cup
of jack squat. He's a winner though. Lemongrass is the place, I used to go
to the one in Squirrel Hill.
http://www.digitalcity.com/pittsburgh/dining/venue.adp?sbid=107696354&type=overview

[mark] also referred me to Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield, which is a place I
am very fond of. If you've never tried the Mussman Curry - check it out.
Their Tom Kha Guy is beaucoup badass too.

Since we're talking about places not downtown, my personal favorite is My
Ngoc in the strip. Its not the fanciest restaurant but their heat scale is
an order of magnitude higher than anywhere I've been. Jackie can gauge
your capabilities and take you to the point of spiritual enlightenment
through the raw power of deadly red hot chile pepper magic.

Tram's in Bloomfield/Garfield is really good too. Its a little more
focused on Vietnamese, but its cheap and byob.

Sorry for the Off-Topic posts, but I saw some interest from people on here.

This is cool.  I checked this out and its no surprise
that every filthy rich corporation CEO and family in

max contribution) to George Bush.  Including the CEO
of the company I program for.

Names including : 
Suarez
Timken
Schumacher
Diebold

Do you think they know all there personal information
is available online because of it?

Also not surprising is the $2000 contribution from Richard Scaife, owner
of the "fair and balanced" Tribune-Review here in Pittsburgh.
There were also big contributions from the Hillman family, which kinda
surprises me, cause they seemed kinda cool, but not really.
Also a bunch of professors here at CMU.  This campus is appearing to be
rather conservative, and its freaking me out.

good god it wasnt that long ago.

mind overload was on ram trilogy chapter 2 - 12"

funkstation (also in my top 10) was on ram trilogy chapter 3 - 2x12"

the molten beats sampler had evolution b/w the ed & optical fusion of mind overload & scanners (scanners was the b side on ram trilogy chapter 1)

and as far as molten beats goes, i wasn't really feeling it when it came out, but now that i look back i realize what a good lp it was.  human future is my fave cut from there.

im on the crack smoking tip today. i thought that mind overload 
was the ed+op remix of mindscan and something else. argh. and it 
was that long ago, half a decade at this point. damn. no wonder 
why i got those titles mixed up. 

>and as far as molten beats goes, i wasn't really feeling it when

was.  human future is my fave cut from there.

i cant even think of one cut on there that i liked. it came out at 
the same time as john bs great album and the one fantastic comp on 
RH. it didnt stand out compared to those at all.

human future is my favorite on molten beats too...i love the sound of that 
whole era of ram...it was a very full sound...i know alot of it was just 
them playing with the filter envelope or the mod wheel...but the sounds are 
still awesome.

i was playing it at home about a year ago...bumping my bedroom a little too 
hard...an hennesy bottle fell off of the shelf above the turntables and 
cracked the record while it was playing on the table  :(

there will be a use for it/them sometime soon.
