	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} Serato vs finalscratch? What's the best tables for either?

Yeah the little JVC speakers that could with 3" woofers (and 3"
excursion lol) have done great considering... but sometimes I want the
whole house to shake, and it would be nice to do a renegade from time
to time.

So this weekend, I picked up a pair of Yamaha S115v and a Behringer
europower 2500 amp, along with a Numark DM1001mk2 mixer. It's loud as
hell and sounds pretty good... I had this setup back in '98-2000, but
I had the Mackey FS series amp instead, which I think sounded
noticibly better.

Anyhow since I've gotten it, I'm starting to have dreams of spinning a
little, mostly at home... I dont have any plans to DJ at any parties.

The thing is, I lived through the 70s and 80s when Vinyl / 8 tracks
were the only choice, until casettes came out, but they sounded like
crap... Anyhow I learned to hate messing around with vinyl...
anti-static, cleaning, scratching, breaking, getting them out, putting
them away, losing them, heat warping them, carrying them, storing
them, trying to get rid of hiss and pops and avoiding skips and jumps,
needles breaking... buying the same record for the 4th time... I
REALLY hate vinyl.

So I thought CDJs? I still dont want to carry around a ton of CDs, and
have to burn them all the time and store them, and label them. Then
getting a setup that you can scratch with seems hit or miss, and they
get damn expensive too.

So I'm now focusing on a setup that will let me scratch from laptop or
similar... I'm thinking of picking up either serato scratch live or
stanton final scratch. From what I can see, the latest version of each
is gonna cost me about $500, and used not much cheaper... however I've
seen the 1.5 version of final scratch on eBay for around $200-$300. If
there's not much of a functionality difference, I'd be inclined to
save the cash and go with that.

Has anyone on this list used serato, and finalscratch 1.5 and
finalscratch 2.0? I'd love to hear a breakdown of pros and cons and
whats sacrificed if I go with a cheaper finalscratch 1.5. Mainly my
usage pattern should be playing mp3s off the desktop or laptop, and
rarely rarely throwing on a live rekkid to mix in. I imagine quite
frequently though, to have DJs spinning just real vinyl... I know
they'll hate the cheap tables I buy but they can bring their own if
it's that much of a problem.

Also, I'll need to pick up a set of tables for this... I dont want
anything expensive... I'd love to keep the price on a set of tables
under $300, I've seen direct drive tables at about this price for a
set. Anyone have any recommendations for tables?

TIA,

Dan K

I've used both, and I have to say I'm partial to miss pinky.

I'm a supporter of DJDecks (www.djdecks.be)  The software offers support for
time-coded vinyls, so all you need is a worthy ASIO sound card:
http://forum.djdecks.be/viewtopic.php?t=2249

I managed to get my hands on a BCD2000 a few months back, which I use as an
all-in-one pre-amp/mixer/sound card solution.  The latest beta of the
DJDecks software has offered me solid reliability and performance.  With a
little creative routing of the master and headphone outputs, it is possible
to use another mixer for a more rugged and weighty feel - the BCD2000 is
plastic and feels kind of cheap.

So, for a total investment of $160 (BCD2000) + $25 Serato vinyls + $50
software I have full TCV setup.  Scratch that, I sold my old mixer for about
$100 since I'm using the BCD2000, so my total cost has been relatively low.

Serato is simpler but much less CPU intensive, Final Scratch 1.0 is
Linux-based, which was very interesting to me and would have gone with it if
I hadn't discovered DJ Decks. Final Scratch 1.5 uses the old scratchamp and
software, but it is cheaper.  Final Scratch 2 has a new scratchamp and the
software is a huge improvement (
http://www.deeprhythms.com/phorum/read.php?8,10539,12385) but is a resource
hog.

As for tables, see if you can find a pair of 1200's in your budget.
Everyone but me loves them.  I have Numark Pro TT-2's, which are rather
decent:

make something up that you are "graphically" composing the music by
altering the various colors and designs.  Get a visualization plugin
that lets you change various aspects by mashing buttons on the keyboard.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Serato vs finalscratch? What's the best tables for either?

Thanks for the input you guys.

I wasn't aware of the 3rd party software...

After checking them all out, I ended up deciding just to buy the
interface hardware first: Hercules DJ Console MK2 USB DJ/Audio
Interface. It's basically a 4 channel audio in and out unit that hooks
up via usb, and has phono preamps. It runs $250 new.

http://www.samedaymusic.com/product--HERDJCONSOLEMKII

It also has jog wheels like CDJs, so I think I'll mess around with
that for a bit, then if I decide to go further I can buy turntables
and either mispinky or djdecks and just use the hercules unit as the
I/O. mispinky looks nice cause it comes with an SDK, so I could
possibly end up programming my own software. A lot of fun coming down
the pipe.

Anyone know of any other software along the same lines as mspinky / DJDecks?

Subject: A bit of Trance History: KLF - What Time is Love (Pure Trance 
Mix) - Rare Video

This track came out originally in 1988, this video was probably made
in 1989 or 1990 when TVT picked it up, I think because the video has
an Mtv logo on it (back when mtv was cool).

I've been a KLF fan for a long time, this video is sweet because it's
the "pure trance version" so no vocals or other late 80s/early 90s
jive. Also KLF had this weird obsession with sheep, one time they had
gallons of sheep's blood in a van they were going to "use" during an
awards thingy in the UK.

This track is one of the first trance tracks ever made by some sources.(1)

This track came out before the labels  Harthouse/Eye-Q (Sven Vath's
labels that combined alot of goa/trancey tunes (like trancey sounds
from the label MFS)  with German techno sounds, kinda a
proto-psy-trance... from 1993-1997). I have alot of Harthouse CD's and
the psy sound is there in many tracks. Just not refined.

Once Goa-parties started to become illegal, the Harthouse/European
techno sound heavily influenced goa-trance and, from what I believe,
created "Psy-trance" as we know it today. 1997/1998 were I think
transition years for Goa to Psy because alot of it started to have a
more hynoptic (techno) sound merged with trippy atomospheres. When the
minimal trance movement of 1998-2002 was big, techno was- I think the
main factor in this.

KLF was totally pre-Goa too. Even before EBM pioneers like Front 242,
Front Line Assembly and others went out to Disco Valley in Goa to
party and met up with the likes of Goa-gill, Raja Ram, etc. KLF did
this first. In the UK.

Very futuristic in alot of ways. Kind of merged the Acid House sound
with a faster more upbeat EBM beat and their own "trance" style.
Definatly a trance classic, here's the video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrWW0FOXnA


(1) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trance_music

The earliest identifiable trance recordings came not from within the
trance scene itself, but from the UK acid house movement, and were
made by The KLF. The most notable of these were the original 1988 /
1989 versions of 'What Time Is Love' and '3AM Eternal' (the former
indeed laying out the entire blueprint for the trance sound - as well
as helping to inspire the sounds of hardcore and rave) and the 1988
track 'Kylie Said Trance'. Their use of the term 'pure trance' to
describe these recordings reinforces this case strongly. These early
recordings were markedly different from the releases and re-releases
to huge commercial success around the period of the 'White Room' album
(1991) and are significantly more minimalist, nightclub-oriented and
'underground' in sound.


Dan-d-raver would probably like this.Hell I bet he probably saw them
play live :)

Also anyone on the list feel free to add to the thread, correct me, or
strike me dead as you please :)

The best way to understand the present music is to know the past.

There's a bit of information in the video that dates its airtime a  
bit more recently than 89-90. MTV2 wasn't launched as MTV2 until  
2000, from 1996 till 1999 it was known as M2. I might be able to look  
around some archives at the office and date the channel bug more  
specifically, but I'm betting that while the video might be older,  
you can't date it based on it the channel bug info.

well, just because it played on m2 doesn't mean it had to come out at
that time.  Heck they've probably played video killed the radio star on
m2.  Although m2 is no longer "just videos" if I recall.  Man I remember
spending my youth watching MTV and all the 80's early 90's music vids,
before they decided to stop playing music videos.

Yeah, M2 stopped playing music videos around the clock about the same  
time they changed the name to MTV2.

Oddly enough, MTV is still cool as all get out, it's just that the  
cable/satellite companies don't have the resources to pipe through  
all the MTV channels. I'm not sure if its a monetary or bandwidth  
thing. Many of the networks demand that if you carry certain  
channels, you have to pay for them, all of them, for all your  
subscribers, whether they watch it or not -- which has been something  
I've been trying to tell people who think ala carte cable is cool, it  
WILL be more expensive because of the lack of provisioning for  
networks who want to screw you.

Anyway, MTV has some really cool channels and ideas. There's probably  
about a dozen different channels right now under their brands that  
few even get to see. They've got... crap, I'd tell you but I'd have  
to kill you. The crap you see drives innovation you don't see -- yet.

I'm hoping that Apple thinks through this iTV thing they have and  
they don't throw away about three decades of set top box design. With  
some of the ideas that more progressive networks like MTV have, the  
iTV could really be something that ushers in an age of something  
completely different.

Wait, MTV is half of URGE. Well, everyone makes their mistakes.

and secluded campsites, for a relaxing and energizing gathering Last
Chance Blast before the Autumn chill sweeps in.

The CHILLUMINATI opened 2006 with the biggest Chinese festival of the
year, the New Year. We close 2006 on the night of the second-biggest
Chinese festival of the year, the Moon Festival. We also gather on the
the Full Moon, a night of Power for Goans across the planet. Come
Merge Your Light with Ours.

Scroll down for much more info on artist lineup, venue, and more.

    We invoke a mood, consciousness, or state of mind using
psychedelic music, video, and 2/3 Dimensional art, dance, fire and
kinetic performance. The Participant is immersed in visuals and sound,
suspended in a Space which transcends everyday consciousness.

    Our music is 24 hours, both Trance and Chill/Psyambient, and takes
place on two separate stages. Trance is Dance. Chill is melodic and
softer, and creates a relaxing and peaceful mood. The Chill/EDM stage
features Psyambient, Downtempo, IDM, Ambient, Techno, Dub, Breaks,
World Fusion, and Future Sound.

    We are an Intentional Community, meaning that everyone is an
Artist and Active Participant, not spectators. Our events are clean
and based on Respect and creating a more beautiful life for each
participant.

Subject: [Fwd: {pb-cle} Housemate wanted - Cuyahoga Falls]

Ack. I put an ad in the paper and haven't gotten any calls. My local
market appears to be pretty stagnant -- places are for sale all over the
place and they aren't selling. Prices are being lowered, and who wants to
rent in this kind of buyer's market?

It's a 3-bedroom brick house with a nice porch, AC, full basement, and
nice back yard that I have completely landscaped and is "the filet of the
neighborhood." My ad says $850/month.

I'd still rather just live there, though. That's why I'm reposting this
call for roommates -- we'd share the whole house so rent is completely
negotiable. And believe it or not, I've actually been told I am "easy to
live with," so long as you're not romantically involved with me, LOL.

Nice, safe neighborhood off of 4th St in the Falls. Two roommates are
moving out by the end of the month and I can't afford the place without
help.

This is the pimpest, most low-key, non-cop-attracting place within 15
minutes of downtown Akron. Come scare the neighbors with us! I keep food
and beer in the fridge. Word.

Yeah, who wouldn't when she makes meals that serve 10 people.  Can't  
count how many times I've been over there and she's like "I made some  
food and there's some left" and there's still like 3/4 of it left. :)

I had influenced alot of FOX TV shows ever since I had interviewed
senior FOX programmer Tom Kennedy in a zine i did at the time 
(1994) PLRM (peace love rave magazine) for misrepresenting ravers
...In a 90210 episode the 90210 episode had a "rave' at a mansion
and someone had spiked the punch with 'lsd'...As one of the founding
fathers of the Ohio underground scene since 1984...I had to explain
to him that most raves are not held in mansions but in warehouses
and there is never punch with LSD, but there are smart drink stands
that sell smoothies with vitamins in it....And I had to explain although
party go'ers had been caught smoking dope before...Most promotors
prefer no illegal substances at their parties since the party can get
busted if cops find illegal substances at the party...However, promotors
can not control what party patrons do before coming to the party.

At the time I worked at MBNA, a Fortune 500 company job one could
not even get without passing a drug test and two interviews...
former FBI Director Louie Freeh was an exec at MBNA...MBNA is
now owned by Bank of America...I worked there for almost four
years in Cleveland, Ohio until 1997...Almost every job I ever had one 
had to pass a drug test and two interviews...I always passed with 
flying colors because I don't even smoke cigarettes (although I had 
tried weed and ecstacy a long time before for one year)...I have 
worked account executive jobs with government, military, fortune 
500 company, and healthcare accounts since 1998...and every time 
I had to pass a drug test and two interviews.

The Chairman of the Board of FOX was also in the same fraternity
I was in: ZBT...ZBT is like the skull and bones of jewish fraternities,
the alumni list reads like a who's who list of VIP's in media, politics,
and athletics...

As a result I and my family have inspired numerous movies and TV shows

THE LAST EMPEROR (my mother, the 'king' line is related to one of the earliest
chinese emperors when they were known as sons of heaven, chosen messengers
of God...not the one who hacked heads to get opium out of china) 
EMPIRE OF THE SUN (early spielberg debuting a very young christian bale, who

mind...that turned out to be layla, who i would meet later on in columbus, ohio)
PECKER (early eddie furlong (from Termintor) film when he dons a camera and

FAHRENHEIT 9/11 (after i moved to california, i go into deep investigation of
9/11 and write numerous internet posts citing the architectural aspect of the
9/11 investigation, because i graduated with a degree in architecture from
CWRU in '97 and i wrote the insider trading aspect of the 9/11 investigation
since i worked mostly as an account executive for 8 years in ohio)
AGENT CODY BANKS (malcom in the middle plays CIA agent influenced by my

on the big screen thanks to computer graphic magic...also depicting me as
the wrath of God when i was daring rachel)

more difficult than he thought it would...after discovering i had gained divine
enlightenment, I find saving the world much more difficult than i thought it

i had acquired $1.4 trillion dollars for the federal government from japanese
and chinese US treasury bond investors)
MEN IN BLACK (from all my intelligence posts of the good aliens - the pleidians,
the family of light v. the evil aliens, the greys, who had abducted humans 
before for experiments)
ROMEO MUST DIE (the clash between asian americans, many of which are cops
since san francisco police chief heather fung is chinese american and black

candidate and of course there are worries there are veterans who want 
to shoot me)

predicting the future...when the media gets too overbearing, he wishes he
had never made his discovery...he ends up scratching a hole in his head to
forget and talking to a little girl)
THE OMEGA CODE (produced by matthew crouch, son of TBN founder paul
crouch...influenced by all the internet intelligence reports i wrote about
concerning the bible code...i would cite calamities from earthchangestv.com
fulfilling bible prophecies and then post world solutions with the natural
disaster division of homeland security to save things)
BEAUTIFUL MIND (jennifer connelly shows the ups and downs of dating a
paranoid genius...another film of when i was dating rachel and our hard
times from my being 'too smart')
SECRET WINDOW (mort played by johnny depp is confronted by a lunatic
who claims that he copied his ideas for his books...hollywood writers way 
of telling me that they had used the internet to peer into my secret window
before, but are denying it and consider me a bit crazy for it)
BIG (tom hanks plays a grown adult stuck in a boy's body...hollywood
thinks i am a grown adult stuck in a boy's body because i look so young)
FORREST GUMP (not too smart forrest gump goes through life in a hap-
hazzard fashion and still finds himself influencing the most critical of worldly
matters...sometimes i am potrayed as a half wit, but somehow i still find

internet intelligence posts of world solutions)

he has to figure out the meaning of the fifth element to stop it...a meteor
is prophesized to hit the earth in revelation...humans must learn to stop
hating and start loving to stop it)
THX1138 (in the future humans are supposed to only work and take drugs,
two humans discover they love each other and must break out of the 
pattern...although it is the earliest fim that george lucas ever did...it is
an amazing prophecy of myself and my situation with layla)

Mad TV (Mad TV was created by a ZBT alumni, several of their sketches
 are based off of my life)
SNL (NBC's largest account is the 2008 China Olmpic account, but is
  strongly associated with GE / the Watts)
Fox News (I already explained my ties with Fox)
X-Files (show that spawned from all my intelligence posts about aliens
  on the internet)
WB and Smallville (Jack Warner was a ZBT Alumni, WB behind Batman and the
  Matrix...I grew up in Rootstown, Ohio by Kent, Ohio...the root of david and
  where the KSU student shooting took place during the Vietnam War...the
  deaths of those four ohio college students brought enough attention to
  end the War in Vietnam...the new four seem to be myself, jinx, favor, and
  garred martin to end the War in Iraq)

Intern (MUST be a student)<br>&gt; Los Angeles, CA United States<br>&gt; Fox Networks Group<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Fox is worshipping at the "Church of Steve," a half-hour comedy from Will <br>&gt; Ferrell and Adam McKay's Gary Sanchez Prods.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Single-camera laffer, created and written by Chris Henchy
 ("I'm With Her"), <br>&gt; revolves around an average Joe from New Jersey who finds out he's a descendant <br>&gt; of Jesus. Fox said it has given a put pilot commitment to the project, which <br>&gt; will be produced by Gary Sanchez Prods. and Sony Pictures Television.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Henchy was recently tapped to serve in a senior exec capacity at Sanchez <br>(Daily <br>&gt; Variety, Aug. 16), which is based at Paramount Vantage for film. Before he <br>took <br>&gt; that gig, he had set up a blind script deal at Sony. When he came up with the <br>&gt; idea for "Steve," Henchy pitched it to Ferrell and McKay, and the trio decided <br>&gt; to attach the Sanchez label.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Pilot will be exec produced by Henchy, McKay and Ferrell.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Henchy said his "Steve" won't have any religious superpowers, nor will the <br>pilot <br>&gt; script confirm that Steve is, in fact, actually a blood relative of Jesus.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Instead, the pilot sets up a
 scenario in which a biblical scholar from Italy <br>&gt; comes to the conclusion that Steve is a descendant of Christ. Except for a few <br>&gt; of his close friends and relatives, Steve -- who'll be unmarried and without <br>&gt; children -- keeps the news of his lineage a secret.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; "We explore what this guy's life is like with this knowledge," Henchy said. <br>&gt; "He's a guy who always felt he was destined for something greater, who's <br>always <br>&gt; trying to force his wisdom on other people."<br>&gt; <br>&gt; While film is the company's focus, Gary Sanchez Prods. now finds itself with <br>two <br>&gt; potential TV skeins.

> CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy - Seeking to end anger in the Islamic world over his

> historic enmities and together reject violence, saying the future of humanity 
is 
> at stake
> The pope also urged "reciprocity" in religious freedom, calling for preserving 
> the rights of Christians throughout the Islamic world.
> "The circumstances which have given rise to our gathering are well known," 
> Benedict said, referring to his remarks on Islam in a Sept. 12 speech at 
> Regensburg University in Germany, which set off protests around the Muslim 
> world.
> He did not dwell on the contested remarks, in which he quoted a 14th-century 
> Byzantine emperor as saying: "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, 
> and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to 
> spread by the sword the faith he preached."
> Benedict has already expressed regret for offending Muslims and said his 
remarks 
> did not reflect his personal views, but he has not offered a complete apology 
as 
> some have sought.
> Still, his five-minute address Monday at a meeting with 22 foreign diplomats 
and 
> representatives of Italian Muslim organizations  whom the pope greeted 
> one-by-one, clasping their hands warmly  seemed to be well received by his 
> guests at his vacation palace in the Alban Hills south of Rome.
> "The Holy Father stated his profound respect for Islam. This is what we were 
> expecting," Iraqi envoy Albert Edward Ismail Yelda said as he left the 
30-minute 
> meeting. "It is now time to put what happened behind and build bridges."
> Nearly all the other envoys left without speaking to reporters. The embassies 
of 
> Egypt and Turkey said their ambassadors would have no comment. The Iranian, 
> Indonesian, Lebanese and Libyan embassies did not answer their phones.
> Fahmi Howeidi, a liberal Islamic writer in Egypt, said that since the pope did 
> not apologize, protests may continue. "(Benedict) addressed the ambassadors 
but 
> didn't deal with the Muslim street, the anger in the street will continue," 
> Howeidi said in a telephone interview.
> Tariq Ramadan, a professor of Islamic studies at Oxford University, called the 
> meeting "mainly political" intended to improve relations with Muslim states.
> "The people that were convinced he was against Islam are not going to change 
> their minds," said Ramadan, who recently wrote that Muslims must respond to 
> Benedict's view of the Christian character of Europe and what it means for 
> identity.
> Al-Jazeera, the Arab-language broadcaster, carried the pope's speech live.
> Benedict touched on religion and violence, saying Christians and Muslims "must 
> learn to work together ... to guard against all forms of intolerance and to 
> oppose all manifestations of violence."
> He quoted from a key document of the Second
> Vatican Council in the 1960s stating that "although considerable dissensions 
and 
> enmities between Christians and Muslims may have arisen in the course of the 
> centuries," both faiths must move on and work for "peace and freedom for all 
> people."
> Benedict said he invited the diplomats to "strengthen the bonds of friendship" 
> between their religions, but did not offer any analysis of the controversial 
> passage, which came in a speech exploring faith and reason.
> The pope said dialogue between Christians and Muslims "cannot be reduced to an 
> optional extra. It is, in fact, a vital necessity on which in large measure 
our 
> future depends."
> Benedict has been seen as less interested in promoting close relations with 
> Muslims than his predecessor, John Paul II, whose travels in the Muslim world 
> included a visit to a mosque in
> Syria.
> He cited John Paul in his speech Monday, noting his predecessor's words, 
during 
> a visit to Morocco in 1985, urging that "respect and dialogue require 
> reciprocity in all spheres," particularly religious freedom. This is a major 
> issue for the Vatican in Saudi Arabia and other countries where non-Muslims 
> cannot worship openly.
> Saudi Arabia does not have diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Among 
> predominantly Muslim nations with diplomatic ties to the Vatican, only Sudan 
did 
> not participate in the meeting.
> Among those attending was a diplomat from Indonesia, where Christian-Muslim 
> tensions were heightened last week by the execution of three Roman Catholic 
> militants. Benedict had appealed for the men's lives to be spared.
> Turkey also participated. Benedict plans to travel in November to that 
> predominantly Muslim but officially secular country, which was among the first 
> to vigorously protest the Regensburg remarks.
> Last week, the Holy See's ambassadors in Muslim countries met with officials 
to 
> assure them the pope respects Islam and to urge a complete reading of the 
> speech.
> The Vatican and much of the Muslim world share some important goals, including 
> the battle against legalized abortion. Benedict also was among the first to 
urge
> Israel to turn to dialogue in its battle in Lebanon against Hezbollah 
> guerrillas.
> Benedict gave "a very clear, very intelligent speech," said Mohamed Nour 
Dachan, 
> an Italian of Syrian origin who heads the Union of Islamic Communities, one of 
> the more radical Italian Muslim groups. "In a few words, the dialogue goes on. 
> The dialogue is a priority for both Muslims and Christians."
> In a departure from usual practice, the Vatican press office included a

 oktoberfest there was a pope mini-series put out that<br>&gt; showed when John Paul was shot, african gang members had<br>&gt; burned swastikas in front of german american houses in southern<br>&gt; california, a black reporter accused an old german man of being<br>&gt; a pedophile at a texas oktoberfest for taking pictures of young<br>&gt; girls...turned out he was taking a photograph of his daughter and<br>&gt; her friends...black gangs also attacked some german americans<br>&gt; who protested against black violence in toledo, ohio, which also<br>&gt; resulted in a female toledo officer getting a concusion after a<br>&gt; brick was thrown through her windshield, later blacks were<br>&gt; successful in tricking Ohio FBI in believing yemeni's were behind<br>&gt; the attack, when yemeni's had not been able to get to america<br>&gt; since the bombing of the USS Cole and the Security Video shows<br>&gt; no yemeni's whatsoever, just black gang members chasing after<br>&gt; the
 fleeing german americans.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; even for Love Parade SF this year, West Coast Homeland Security<br>&gt; included San Francisco Police Department (headed by Heather<br>&gt; Fung), San Francisco Fire Department, undercover Army National<br>&gt; Guard, and some other local volunteers including: Hells Angels,<br>&gt; Oakland Raiders, SF 49'ers, and some WWE professional wrestlers<br>&gt; that i had also invited.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; there shall be equal amount of security at Oktoberfests in California,<br>&gt; Nevada, Texas, and Ohio this year.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ---<br>&gt; <br>&gt; from <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060925/ap_on_re_eu/pope_muslims" target="_blank">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060925/ap_on_re_eu/pope_muslims</a><br>&gt; <br>&gt; Pope says 2 faiths must overcome enmity<br>&gt; By MARTA FALCONI, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 22 minutes ago<br>&gt; <br>&gt; CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy - Seeking to end anger in the Islamic world over his <br>&gt;
 remarks on holy war,<br>&gt; Pope Benedict XVI told Muslim envoys Monday their two faiths must overcome <br>&gt; historic enmities and together reject violence, saying the future of humanity <br>is <br>&gt; at stake<br>&gt; The pope also urged "reciprocity" in religious freedom, calling for preserving <br>&gt; the rights of Christians throughout the Islamic world.<br>&gt; "The circumstances which have given rise to our gathering are well known," <br>&gt; Benedict said, referring to his remarks on Islam in a Sept. 12 speech at <br>&gt; Regensburg University in Germany, which set off protests around the Muslim <br>&gt; world.<br>&gt; He did not dwell on the contested remarks, in which he quoted a 14th-century <br>&gt; Byzantine emperor as saying: "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, <br>&gt; and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to <br>&gt; spread by the sword the faith he preached."<br>&gt; Benedict has already expressed
 regret for offending Muslims and said his <br>remarks <br>&gt; did not reflect his personal views, but he has not offered a complete apology <br>as <br>&gt; some have sought.<br>&gt; Still, his five-minute address Monday at a meeting with 22 foreign diplomats <br>and <br>&gt; representatives of Italian Muslim organizations  whom the pope greeted <br>&gt; one-by-one, clasping their hands warmly  seemed to be well received by his <br>&gt; guests at his vacation palace in the Alban Hills south of Rome.<br>&gt; "The Holy Father stated his profound respect for Islam. This is what we were <br>&gt; expecting," Iraqi envoy Albert Edward Ismail Yelda said as he left the <br>30-minute <br>&gt; meeting. "It is now time to put what happened behind and build bridges."<br>&gt; Nearly all the other envoys left without speaking to reporters. The embassies <br>of <br>&gt; Egypt and Turkey said their ambassadors would have no comment. The Iranian, <br>&gt; Indonesian, Lebanese and
 Libyan embassies did not answer their phones.<br>&gt; Fahmi Howeidi, a liberal Islamic writer in Egypt, said that since the pope did <br>&gt; not apologize, protests may continue. "(Benedict) addressed the ambassadors <br>but <br>&gt; didn't deal with the Muslim street, the anger in the street will continue," <br>&gt; Howeidi said in a telephone interview.<br>&gt; Tariq Ramadan, a professor of Islamic studies at Oxford University, called the <br>&gt; meeting "mainly political" intended to improve relations with Muslim states.<br>&gt; "The people that were convinced he was against Islam are not going to change <br>&gt; their minds," said Ramadan, who recently wrote that Muslims must respond to <br>&gt; Benedict's view of the Christian character of Europe and what it means for <br>&gt; identity.<br>&gt; Al-Jazeera, the Arab-language broadcaster, carried the pope's speech live.<br>&gt; Benedict touched on religion and violence, saying Christians and Muslims "must <br>&gt;
 learn to work together ... to guard against all forms of intolerance and to <br>&gt; oppose all manifestations of violence."<br>&gt; He quoted from a key document of the Second<br>&gt; Vatican Council in the 1960s stating that "although considerable dissensions <br>and <br>&gt; enmities between Christians and Muslims may have arisen in the course of the <br>&gt; centuries," both faiths must move on and work for "peace and freedom for all <br>&gt; people."<br>&gt; Benedict said he invited the diplomats to "strengthen the bonds of friendship" <br>&gt; between their religions, but did not offer any analysis of the controversial <br>&gt; passage, which came in a speech exploring faith and reason.<br>&gt; The pope said dialogue between Christians and Muslims "cannot be reduced to an <br>&gt; optional extra. It is, in fact, a vital necessity on which in large measure <br>our <br>&gt; future depends."<br>&gt; Benedict has been seen as less interested in promoting close relations
 with <br>&gt; Muslims than his predecessor, John Paul II, whose travels in the Muslim world <br>&gt; included a visit to a mosque in<br>&gt; Syria.<br>&gt; He cited John Paul in his speech Monday, noting his predecessor's words, <br>during <br>&gt; a visit to Morocco in 1985, urging that "respect and dialogue require <br>&gt; reciprocity in all spheres," particularly religious freedom. This is a major <br>&gt; issue for the Vatican in Saudi Arabia and other countries where non-Muslims <br>&gt; cannot worship openly.<br>&gt; Saudi Arabia does not have diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Among <br>&gt; predominantly Muslim nations with diplomatic ties to the Vatican, only Sudan <br>did <br>&gt; not participate in the meeting.<br>&gt; Among those attending was a diplomat from Indonesia, where Christian-Muslim <br>&gt; tensions were heightened last week by the execution of three Roman Catholic <br>&gt; militants. Benedict had appealed for the men's lives to be
 spared.<br>&gt; Turkey also participated. Benedict plans to travel in November to that <br>&gt; predominantly Muslim but officially secular country, which was among the first <br>&gt; to vigorously protest the Regensburg remarks.<br>&gt; Last week, the Holy See's ambassadors in Muslim countries met with officials <br>to <br>&gt; assure them the pope respects Islam and to urge a complete reading of the <br>&gt; speech.<br>&gt; The Vatican and much of the Muslim world share some important goals, including <br>&gt; the battle against legalized abortion. Benedict also was among the first to <br>urge<br>&gt; Israel to turn to dialogue in its battle in Lebanon against Hezbollah <br>&gt; guerrillas.<br>&gt; Benedict gave "a very clear, very intelligent speech," said Mohamed Nour <br>Dachan, <br>&gt; an Italian of Syrian origin who heads the Union of Islamic Communities, one of <br>&gt; the more radical Italian Muslim groups. "In a few words, the dialogue goes on. <br>&gt; The
 dialogue is a priority for both Muslims and Christians."<br>&gt; In a departure from usual practice, the Vatican press office included a <br>&gt; translation of the speech in Arabic.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; --<br>&gt; <br>&gt; original message:<br>&gt; Subject:   Re: Honorary Members of West Coast Homeland Security - Trish, <br>&gt; Batista, and Steve Austin...<br>&gt; Date:  Saturday, September 23, 2006 2:59:58 AM  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; john cena's new film - the marine...<br>&gt; <a href="http://www.vidilife.com/video_play_836321_John_Cena_as_Triton_in_The_Marine.htm" target="_blank"><br>http://www.vidilife.com/video_play_836321_John_Cena_as_Triton_in_The_Marine.htm</a><br>&gt; trish stratus videos...<br>&gt; <a href="http://www.vidilife.com/video_play_649032_Deadly_Stratusfaction.htm" target="_blank">http://www.vidilife.com/video_play_649032_Deadly_Stratusfaction.htm</a><br>&gt; <a href="http://www.vidilife.com/video_play_809720_FareWell_Trish_Stratus.htm"

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

HELLHOUSE III

October 28, 2006
Louisville, KY
at the Mellwood Arts Center
$10.00 ($5.00 with costume)

Welcome to the third installment of HELLHOUSE, where we acknowledge the 
Pagan spirit with dance and celebration. Why dance? The dance can seem 
frivolous when suffering seems omnipresent and disaster looms in all 
directions. We maintain that dance in a time of death is an act of 
revolution. And so on October 28th we lead a Danse Macabre spiraling 
into "a deep place" "where the sun is silent." When we get there we will 
find that Eros, the joyous life impulse and Thanatos, the death instinct 
heaven and hell are not at opposite ends of the spectrum. Instead, they 
too are dancing. So come all! Outcasts and angels. The lost and the 
lustful. Come gluttons and heretics. Come all and laugh into the face of 
death The divine comedy.
Musical Talent
MATTHEW DEAR as AUDION

Ghostly / Spectral / M-nus

Matthew DearDisplaying a capacity for styles ranging from rhythmic pop 
to gritty tech-house, Matthew Dear has quickly become one of America's 
most revered electronic producers. Between stunning live performances, 
evolved DJ sets and highly developed recordings, Matthew has perked the 
ears of the industry's best. His debut album under his birth name, Leave 
Luck to Heaven, is sleek minimal techno, containing an extraordinary 
sense of songcraft and an ambient soul; it was given four stars by 
Rolling Stone, amongst dozens of other rave reviews and spots on 
numerous 'Best of 2003' lists. The mini-LP Backstroke garnered similar 
praise in 2004 and served to galvanize his placement amongst the world's 
finest minimal electronic producers. He has more recently adopted the 
Audion alias, which explores a markedly harder edge of his sound, 
suffused with massive beats and sawtooth synth oscillations. Having

DEREK PLASLAIKO

Ghostly

Derek PlaslaikoThis year Derek becomes a staple of the HELLHOUSE 
aesthetic. A Midwest favorite for years, now living in New York City. 
Derek Plaslaiko delves into the realm of dance music in which the head 
and body are equally active. The records he plays click and whirl inside 
the brain while the low end keeps the body busy. Mixing lush techno with 
jackin house and a healthy dose of Detroit classics, Plaslaiko is known 
for his creative track selection, seamlessly woven by pin-point mixing 
skills that rival international DJs like Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, 
and Laurent Garnier (all of whom Plaslaiko has shared deck time with). A 
lifelong music obsessive, Plaslaiko began DJing in 1995, becoming a 
regular on Detroits weekend rave circuit. He was a virtual resident at 
the citys legendary Syst3m Poorboy and Analog parties, as well as the 
weekly resident at Motor-Detroits Tuesday night throw-down, Family. 
Derek was invited by Carl Craig to play the inaugural Detroit Electronic 
Music Festival in 2000. In addition to events across the Midwest, he has 
played internationally (in Dresden and Koln) and has taken to the decks 
at clubbing institutions such as Smartbar in Chicago and Tronic 
Treatment in New York City. Plaslaiko has played alongside Josh Wink, 
John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson, Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, 
Ectomorph, Matthew Herbert, Mike Huckaby, Green Velvet, and Luke Slater. 
Trained in the masterful arts of Motown DJing, Derek Plaslaiko is 
heading up yet another wave of Detroit talent poised to rejuvenate 
dancefloors across the globe.
SKL presents:
JASON CLARK AND ROACH

Son of Dog Mini-Reunion

Jason Clark and RoachJason and Roach started playing music together over 
15 years ago, forming the seminal grindcore band Son Of Dog. Years have 
past, and Roach has gone on to travel the world, eventually settling in 
Los Angeles and performing in various bands and performance acts. Last 
year Roach was the featured theremin player on the Ellen Degeneres Show 
Halloween episode, which obviously foiled plans for the reunion at 
HELLHOUSE II. Since last year, Jason and Roach have performed together 
across the country as AUTOBAHN, the fictitious nihilist band from the 
movie The Big Lebowski. Following the Son of Dog years, Jason teamed up 
with an oddball cast of characters, and formed SKL, a group of 
electronic musicians, performance artists, and other artists. He's also 
released quite a few CD's along the way. This won't be a full reunion of 
Son of Dog, because band practice is difficult from 1200 miles away, but 
expect Halloween to be fully represented by these two characters.
THE RIVETER

(aka LADY FOURSQUARE)

The RiveterWith a fall release due on Felix da Housecat's electro-house 
imprint, Rude Photo one thing certain: This Louisville Slugger is NOT 
hitting like a girl. This summer saw the launch of Backbreaker 
Recordings when she became one of a handful of female label owners 
worldwide. With singles from her Body Language (with KDK) project 
landing on hot pick lists globally, the labels first single, Hijack 
broke the top ten on several international charts. Her set at Hellhouse 
III will feature predominantly original tracks and debuts previously 
unheard material for the first time anywhere.
FRANKIE VEGA

Chicago

Frankie VegaCurrently Frankie Vega heads record labels: Blueline, 
Uppercut, Ammo Recordings, Ghetto Test, and is Assistant director of 
Dust Traxx record label. Daily, he manages Distribution for 35 exclusive 
record labels. Frankie is an infectious force spreading awareness of 
artists, record releases and putting their music on the shelves working 
directly with hundreds of store owners and buyers monthly. When the sun 
goes down, Frankie Vega and partners host signature club and ball room 
events such as IN YOUR SYSTEM, BOTS, BIG BANG SESSIONS and other brands 
through promotion company Majestic Night Life.
MOWGLI

Cincinnati

MowgliIn over a decade of dedicating his life to DJing Drum & Bass and 
Jungle, Mowgli has held his ground as a forefather of the sound in the 
Mid-West. Along with Troll, they have been the epitome of excellent DJ's 
with proper knowledge and attitude in and around the Mid-West. As of 
recently, Mowgli has gone back to playing drums and sampling loops. He 
has equipped artists such as A-sides(Eastside/Fuze/Metalheadz), Dylan & 
Facs(Biotic/XXX/OutBreak), MK2(M.A.D.Bass), and Boombip(Mush/Lex) with 
these drum breaks. He is busy being a regular resident at almost every 
club in the Cincinnati area and is now working with Identity, a Native 
Cincinnati Turntablist on a more hip-hop influenced sound while still 
paying homage to Drum & Bass.
The Details

If you have attended HELLHOUSE in the past, you know what to expect. For 
those that haven't, and we expect there will be quite a few, here are 
some general hints to help you survive the evening:

   1. Tonight we dance the dance of Dionysus, the ancient god of wine 
and fertility. Dionysus represents the mystery religions of the world. 
Ecstatic dance, personal delivery from the daily world through spiritual 
intoxication, and initiation into secret rites. We expect you to come 
with an open mind, ready to celebrate the inexpressible wonders of life 
in this universe.
   2. Make no mistake, this is a Halloween costume party. Dress up, play 
the role, go outside yourself. We create this environment and make it 
inexpensive enough for everyone to participate. You are welcome to come 
in the garb of the early 21st century, but we'd much rather have 1000 
super-heros saving the world from the forces of evil.
   3. Being the pagans we are, we needed a virgin to sacrifice for the 
evening to be truely what it needs to be. That virgin will be the 
Mellwood Arts and Entertainment Center, a ten thousand square foot 
warehouse space that's just begging for our type of fun. The venue 
includes a 1400 square foot outdoor balcony as a smoking patio.
   4. Cash bar will be in full effect as late as is legal. The 
intoxication we referred to in item one isn't just spiritual. It is a 
party, after all.
   5. Artists are invited to contribute to the evening by submitting 
large format pieces that symbolize the HellHouse theme. We suggest you 
build or paint something that includes the HellHouse icons: Gene 
Simmons; the colors red, white, and black; and the themes of paganism, 
spiritual ecstacy, and evil. Please email j2@untranslatable.com if you 
would like to contribute.
   6. No Guest List. Period. Nada. The staff even pays. Please don't 
ask.

Alliances

Grotesque Burlesque, Squallis Puppeteers, Art Sanctuary, PRDF, 
BrilliantlyMad, Derby City Rollergirls, Racecar Productions, Backbreaker 
Recordings, Art Sanctuary

We are going out of our way to invite all groups of people to HellHouse 
to participate and make this the largest and best independently run 
Halloween event in the midwest. If you feel like you have something to 
offer, please get in touch!

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

It's that time of the year again kids! That's right, Gothcoming 2006 is 
just around the corner (Friday, September 22, 2006). Time to dust of 
that tux, dry clean the crinoline and start getting ready for the 
biggest Goth Industrial event of the year!

This year's theme is "Tales from DeCrypt", so you have a lot of 
latitude. It's Gothcoming, so school themes are always in. It's a play 
on words, so you can be Ghetto Goth Fabulous, Undead, or even a Math 
Teacher. Hell, why not do all three?

Once again Outland plays host to our party, and we get to celebrate it's 
first official year at the new location. If you haven't been there yet, 
you really need to check it out!

This is YOUR party so you need to make it the most fun that you can. 
Once again, we have Voltaire performing, and he will once again, be 
crowning this years King and Queen. We'll also be giving away a ton of 
cool prizes, so make sure your mark your calendars.

Album arted!  I'm suprised more people don't actually spend the time  
tagging and whatnot.

Dig the mix. Since your computer hates my turntables, how did you do  
it? Live? Traktor?

Subject: {pb-cle} Cool 303 Site

I'm probably late to the game on this site: http://www.beam.to/ 
midi303 but I caught an interesting effect on it linked from the ABL  
boards. Anyone know what the accenter effect is? Well, I realize what  
it is, but where I might find some more info?

For people who don't have any interest in it, there's still a lot of  
cool 303 videos.

now that the dark tare perverse and wicked bullshit is 
finally getting thrown out, back to going after the real 
bad guys once again...

since AIDS, anthrax, west nile virus, and e.coli originally
came from Africa, and since Zacharias Moussaui, the 20th
9/11 hi-jacker, the Somalians that attempted to bomb 
malls in Columbus, Ohio, and the bio attacks in NY all
came from Africa, it is suspected the e. coli on the spinach
may be another form of african bio warfare attack.

last year a victim died after handling a tainted leather purse 
that was imported from Africa, apparently there was a 
deadly disease on the imported purse.

two years ago, african gang members defecated in 20 new
york park water supplies causing 1,800 new yorkers to get
discentary.

west nile virus as the name indicates came from the west 
nile region of africa.

AIDS originally came from Africa.

75% of the identity theft scams and bogus credit card charges
were traced to Niger, Africa.

every year America donates $20 billion for AIDS victims in Africa,
none of it ever makes it to the victims, all of it gets stolen by
'african rebels' who use it to purchase enormous amounts of
illegal drugs from europe to sell to americans, to buy guns, to
rob banks, rob convenience stores, to car jack cars, to shoot
and rob prostitutes, etc. etc.

atleast 50% of homicides in almost every major city are commited 
by african americans.

75% of the bogus allegations especially of the perverse and
wicked variety are traced to african american gangs sending
officers on wild goose chases (typically targeting politicians 
and other VIP's) so that african american gangs can rob and
steal on the other side of town without law enforcement 
interfernce.

it is highly suspected that Bush wanted to sign the 700 mile
southern border fence not to keep mexicans out, but to keep
african american gang members out that were deported instead
of getting the death penalty from getting back in.

jinx's gang was also responsible for multiple tent robberies 
during the last 'family affair' and it is suspected that garred 
martin's gang held brian wheeler, one of the original promotors 
of 'family affair' at gun point...it is suspected that it one favor's
gang, the hippy mafia, that gave victim who overdosed on LSD
and drove his car into the pond at the last 'family affair'...it was
due to these reasons that brian and i decided to stop doing
the 'family affair' three day event, which used to be the largest
party in ohio, because things had gotten too shady.

this is the reason why many events including club events use
rent-a-cops as security to prevent gun point robberies.

this had been a big problem in clubs and casinos in vegas and
california...vegas uses local law enforcement as well as security
cameras now as a result of these dark tares with guns.

Subject: {pb-cle} places to live in akron

I just took a new job in Akron that I start at the end of this month
and am toying with the idea of moving from Canton to Akron sometime in
the future.

Ideally I would like to find a studio style apartment or something
with at least one large open space that would serve as a
studio/workshop/recordlabelHQ.  Some place where there wont be any
neighbors to bother with loud music.  Are there any apartments above
busineses downtown or anything like that?  Any advice of place to look
that might suit my needs would be appreciated.

Well, amanda is/was looking for a housemate and she's in Cuyahoga

mile from rt 8.

<sarchasm>I know trout LOVED being in "downtown crackron" (arlington

mainly because of gas prices but because I was always worried someone  
was going to break into my car (I left NOTHING of value in there,  
even when I was just going in to pick up trout).  In their defense,  
no one ever did mess with my car when I've left it there all weekend  
before.  And the rent was cheap.  And trout was within walking  
distance of a drive through, 3 check cashing places, a couple chicken  
places, an aldi's, a big lots, and a white castle was about a mile  
away (although it's supposedly closed now?).  Say what you will about  
stereotypes, but that place had all of them.

Thanks Todd,
  Yeah I have lived in the worst of the worst as far as neighborhoods
go so thats not really to much of an issue an issue.  I should state
additionally....that roommates are not an option.  I am just trying to
get a head start on looking into possibilities so that I can maybe
find that ideal place.  Price really isnt an issue.

In that case, definately get a condo and not an apartment (something  
where you lease it, and when you move out can sell it, essentially  
getting back the money you put into it).  That's my main goal, is to  
have enough money to get myself a condo.  Getting an apartment just  
seems like you're throwing money away.  That being said, I have  
considered getting a condo, and then renting it out to room mates.   
Although that can get tricky since I would be able to sell the place  
and essentially make money off of it while the people I rent to would  
just be like an apartment.  Or I would have to keep track of how much  
money everyone puts into it, and when I sell the place split the sale  
price proportionally and it would just be complicated.  If I was  
going to move somewhere, by myself, without price being an issue, I'd  
definately get a condo or house.  Just make sure there's no funky  
bylaws.  The development I'm in now has tons of stupid things like  
"flag poles must be approved by (insert whatever assocation)" so what  
do people do? put flag poles in their back yards.  there were people  
that bitched about having to pay a higher homeowners association fee  
because there were against a fence and the extra money was to  
maintain it.  It was just for the people that had the fence but they  
thought everyone should pay it.  These are the same people that  
didn't want to pay extra for the water fountain because it's not in  
their yards.  It goes on.

If you get an attached condo, get one that's attached at the garages,  
may do better and blocking sound, although I know some places put  
sound insulation between the walls.

Thats an idea to consider.  But not sure about the condo thing.  I
would like something wide open kind of workshop style space. Something
centered more around workspace than living space.

There are def apartments above the clubs on main st. Also not sure where your job is or how much ya make. Mike Love had a fresh studio above main street
but his electric was zoned commercial and that got costly. The best place to bang it out is in a house out in the cut.

Ideally I would like to find a studio style apartment or something
with at least one large open space that would serve as a
studio/workshop/recordlabelHQ.  Some place where there wont be any
neighbors to bother with loud music.  Are there any apartments above
busineses downtown or anything like that?  Any advice of place to look
that might suit my needs would be appreciated.

http://www.vidilife.com/video_play_636873_Dan_Aykroyd_interview_about_UFOs_on_CNN.htm

i think some of the older generation believe techno music 
may have come from aliens.

who remembers 'close encounters of the third kind'?

did the moog or the tb-303 come from alien space
ship technology?

enquiring minds want to know

although, wright patterson air force was one of my accounts 
in ohio, hanger 18 ufo parts were pretty destroyed, i don't
think any use-able technology was derived from it.

SETI was the sponsor to Interstellar Outback 4, who went
to that?

Hah, I know you're more intelligent than that.  Agent Troutman was the
one who got me into the CIA in a still classified division.  If anything
we'd grab you and feed you to the gators.  I'm sure all that opium
infused in your blood would be great for them.

PLUR and SPARKLES! yaaaay!  Next time I see you I'll give you a big ol'
plurry hug the whole time shouting "the power of plur compels you, the
power of plur compels you.." (funny thing is anyone that knows me knows
that I would do that, even being completely sober)  Although with a
short term memory half life of about 5 mins I will more than likely
completely forget this discussion very shortly

Subject: {pb-cle} Split ride to Chimera this sat?

hey all.

I know, I know, lurk lurk lurk.  get it out of your system.  haha.

I'm wondering if anyone from pgh wants to split a ride out to Chimera 
this sat?  I can only spend SO many hours alone in the car before I 
go insane.  That and the gas is starting to wear on my cheap ass.

So if you've got some room in your car or you want to go but don't 
want to drive, hit me back.

My plans are flexible but I have a photo shoot in the morning so i'll 
be tied up most of the day. (not literally, you S&M freaks)

Jaded? Who's jaded?

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

HELLHOUSE III

October 28, 2006
Louisville, KY
at the Mellwood Arts Center
$10.00 ($5.00 with costume)

Welcome to the third installment of HELLHOUSE, where we acknowledge the 
Pagan spirit with dance and celebration. Why dance? The dance can seem 
frivolous when suffering seems omnipresent and disaster looms in all 
directions. We maintain that dance in a time of death is an act of 
revolution. And so on October 28th we lead a Danse Macabre spiraling 
into "a deep place" "where the sun is silent." When we get there we will 
find that Eros, the joyous life impulse and Thanatos, the death instinct 
heaven and hell are not at opposite ends of the spectrum. Instead, they 
too are dancing. So come all! Outcasts and angels. The lost and the 
lustful. Come gluttons and heretics. Come all and laugh into the face of 
death The divine comedy.
Musical Talent
MATTHEW DEAR as AUDION

Ghostly / Spectral / M-nus

Matthew DearDisplaying a capacity for styles ranging from rhythmic pop 
to gritty tech-house, Matthew Dear has quickly become one of America's 
most revered electronic producers. Between stunning live performances, 
evolved DJ sets and highly developed recordings, Matthew has perked the 
ears of the industry's best. His debut album under his birth name, Leave 
Luck to Heaven, is sleek minimal techno, containing an extraordinary 
sense of songcraft and an ambient soul; it was given four stars by 
Rolling Stone, amongst dozens of other rave reviews and spots on 
numerous 'Best of 2003' lists. The mini-LP Backstroke garnered similar 
praise in 2004 and served to galvanize his placement amongst the world's 
finest minimal electronic producers. He has more recently adopted the 
Audion alias, which explores a markedly harder edge of his sound, 
suffused with massive beats and sawtooth synth oscillations. Having 
closed out 2004 as XLR8R magazine's "Artist of the Year" in addition to 
appearances at Mutek, Coachella, and Fabric (London) Dear now turns to 
Audion for Fall 2005's Suckfish LP and further touring around the world. 
Plans for 2006 include a full-length follow-up to Leave Luck to Heaven 
that will further trace the evolution of the distinct Matthew Dear 
sound.
DEREK PLASLAIKO

Ghostly

Derek PlaslaikoThis year Derek becomes a staple of the HELLHOUSE 
aesthetic. A Midwest favorite for years, now living in New York City. 
Derek Plaslaiko delves into the realm of dance music in which the head 
and body are equally active. The records he plays click and whirl inside 
the brain while the low end keeps the body busy. Mixing lush techno with 
jackin house and a healthy dose of Detroit classics, Plaslaiko is known 
for his creative track selection, seamlessly woven by pin-point mixing 
skills that rival international DJs like Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, 
and Laurent Garnier (all of whom Plaslaiko has shared deck time with). A 
lifelong music obsessive, Plaslaiko began DJing in 1995, becoming a 
regular on Detroits weekend rave circuit. He was a virtual resident at 
the citys legendary Syst3m Poorboy and Analog parties, as well as the 
weekly resident at Motor-Detroits Tuesday night throw-down, Family. 
Derek was invited by Carl Craig to play the inaugural Detroit Electronic 
Music Festival in 2000. In addition to events across the Midwest, he has 
played internationally (in Dresden and Koln) and has taken to the decks 
at clubbing institutions such as Smartbar in Chicago and Tronic 
Treatment in New York City. Plaslaiko has played alongside Josh Wink, 
John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson, Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, 
Ectomorph, Matthew Herbert, Mike Huckaby, Green Velvet, and Luke Slater. 
Trained in the masterful arts of Motown DJing, Derek Plaslaiko is 
heading up yet another wave of Detroit talent poised to rejuvenate 
dancefloors across the globe.

past, and Roach has gone on to travel the world, eventually settling in 
Los Angeles and performing in various bands and performance acts. Last 
year Roach was the featured theremin player on the Ellen Degeneres Show 
Halloween episode, which obviously foiled plans for the reunion at 
HELLHOUSE II. Since last year, Jason and Roach have performed together 
across the country as AUTOBAHN, the fictitious nihilist band from the 
movie The Big Lebowski. Following the Son of Dog years, Jason teamed up 
with an oddball cast of characters, and formed SKL, a group of 
electronic musicians, performance artists, and other artists. He's also 
released quite a few CD's along the way. This won't be a full reunion of 
Son of Dog, because band practice is difficult from 1200 miles away, but 
expect Halloween to be fully represented by these two characters.
THE RIVETER

(aka LADY FOURSQUARE)

The RiveterWith a fall release due on Felix da Housecat's electro-house 
imprint, Rude Photo one thing certain: This Louisville Slugger is NOT 
hitting like a girl. This summer saw the launch of Backbreaker 
Recordings when she became one of a handful of female label owners 
worldwide. With singles from her Body Language (with KDK) project 
landing on hot pick lists globally, the labels first single, Hijack 
broke the top ten on several international charts. Her set at Hellhouse 
III will feature predominantly original tracks and debuts previously 
unheard material for the first time anywhere.
FRANKIE VEGA

Chicago

Frankie VegaCurrently Frankie Vega heads record labels: Blueline, 
Uppercut, Ammo Recordings, Ghetto Test, and is Assistant director of 
Dust Traxx record label. Daily, he manages Distribution for 35 exclusive 
record labels. Frankie is an infectious force spreading awareness of 
artists, record releases and putting their music on the shelves working 
directly with hundreds of store owners and buyers monthly. When the sun 
goes down, Frankie Vega and partners host signature club and ball room 
events such as IN YOUR SYSTEM, BOTS, BIG BANG SESSIONS and other brands 
through promotion company Majestic Night Life.
MOWGLI

Cincinnati

MowgliIn over a decade of dedicating his life to DJing Drum & Bass and 
Jungle, Mowgli has held his ground as a forefather of the sound in the 
Mid-West. Along with Troll, they have been the epitome of excellent DJ's 
with proper knowledge and attitude in and around the Mid-West. As of 
recently, Mowgli has gone back to playing drums and sampling loops. He 
has equipped artists such as A-sides(Eastside/Fuze/Metalheadz), Dylan & 
Facs(Biotic/XXX/OutBreak), MK2(M.A.D.Bass), and Boombip(Mush/Lex) with 
these drum breaks. He is busy being a regular resident at almost every 
club in the Cincinnati area and is now working with Identity, a Native 
Cincinnati Turntablist on a more hip-hop influenced sound while still 
paying homage to Drum & Bass.
The Details

If you have attended HELLHOUSE in the past, you know what to expect. For 
those that haven't, and we expect there will be quite a few, here are 
some general hints to help you survive the evening:

   1. Tonight we dance the dance of Dionysus, the ancient god of wine 
and fertility. Dionysus represents the mystery religions of the world. 
Ecstatic dance, personal delivery from the daily world through spiritual 
intoxication, and initiation into secret rites. We expect you to come 
with an open mind, ready to celebrate the inexpressible wonders of life 
in this universe.
   2. Make no mistake, this is a Halloween costume party. Dress up, play 
the role, go outside yourself. We create this environment and make it 
inexpensive enough for everyone to participate. You are welcome to come 
in the garb of the early 21st century, but we'd much rather have 1000 
super-heros saving the world from the forces of evil.
   3. Being the pagans we are, we needed a virgin to sacrifice for the 
evening to be truely what it needs to be. That virgin will be the 
Mellwood Arts and Entertainment Center, a ten thousand square foot 
warehouse space that's just begging for our type of fun. The venue 
includes a 1400 square foot outdoor balcony as a smoking patio.
   4. Cash bar will be in full effect as late as is legal. The 
intoxication we referred to in item one isn't just spiritual. It is a 
party, after all.
   5. Artists are invited to contribute to the evening by submitting 
large format pieces that symbolize the HellHouse theme. We suggest you 
build or paint something that includes the HellHouse icons: Gene 
Simmons; the colors red, white, and black; and the themes of paganism, 
spiritual ecstacy, and evil. Please email j2@untranslatable.com if you 
would like to contribute.
   6. No Guest List. Period. Nada. The staff even pays. Please don't 
ask.

Alliances

Grotesque Burlesque, Squallis Puppeteers, Art Sanctuary, PRDF, 
BrilliantlyMad, Derby City Rollergirls, Racecar Productions, Backbreaker 
Recordings, Art Sanctuary

We are going out of our way to invite all groups of people to HellHouse 
to participate and make this the largest and best independently run 
Halloween event in the midwest. If you feel like you have something to 
offer, please get in touch!

Sat Nov 18                       ASSDRAGON 4                     Pittsburgh

An epic laptop music battle where the winner gets a 7" record release on
No Room For Talent Records

Free to enter! Not a damn thing to lose!

Once again, the time has come for all electronic musicians in this 
forsaken wasteland to gather on the field of battle to prove their 
worth. Blood will spill and valor will be tested, but in the end, one 
champion will rise through the human wreckage and claim the spoils of 
war.

This competition is free to enter and anyone can join. All you need is 
courage...and a computer.

The Rules
This battle is being waged to see which electronic musician can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. You can only use a laptop or desktop 
computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no traditional 
instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug into the RCA 
input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount of material 
ahead of time and use any software you want, although you are encouraged 
to improvise or create material on the fly. Using material from other 
artists is grounds for removal: this rule is potentially misleading 
since you can use samples. Like the Galactic Ass Dragon Classics before 
it, this is not a Traktor battle: make your own shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many people enter, everyone 
who enters gets a 10 minute time slot in the opening round. There will 
be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, you can start 
setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in front of you is 
done, you're on the clock. Tick tock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 will 
move on to the semi-final round where they will have another 10 minutes 
to flay their competitors. At the completion of the semi-round, the top 
2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 minute shot before one 
glorious winner is crowned. The winner receives the highly coveted 
Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their own 7" record release on No 
Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the legendary No Room for Talent 
Records, Dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.

Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you made people get 
up, holler, and/or pump their fists. Getting the crowd to just gently 
bob their heads or feel your "soulful groove" is not only lame, it isn't 
worth any points. Breakcore, hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise 
are what's called for. Playing well-produced techno, drum and bass, 
trance, house, or downtempo idm will result in zero points and possibly 
the bum's rush. While vocals are not prohibited, may Odin have mercy on 
your soul if you dare to assault us with pitiful singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. Get naked. Do a skit. Anything. The more you distract 
everyone from your awful music, the more points you get. If you look 
like you're checking your email during your lunch break at work, you're 
going to do terrible.

This will be taking place at ON Gallery [5005 Penn Avenue] in Pittsburgh 
PA at 7PM. This event is ALL AGES! $3 cover: everyone who enters the 
competition gets in for free, so if you want to skirt the cover charge, 
contact Dave 8cylinder to lay down the guantlet.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

It's that time of the year again kids! That's right, Gothcoming 2006 is 
just around the corner (Friday, September 22, 2006). Time to dust of 
that tux, dry clean the crinoline and start getting ready for the 
biggest Goth Industrial event of the year!

This year's theme is "Tales from DeCrypt", so you have a lot of 
latitude. It's Gothcoming, so school themes are always in. It's a play 
on words, so you can be Ghetto Goth Fabulous, Undead, or even a Math 
Teacher. Hell, why not do all three?

Once again Outland plays host to our party, and we get to celebrate it's 
first official year at the new location. If you haven't been there yet, 
you really need to check it out!

This is YOUR party so you need to make it the most fun that you can. 
Once again, we have Voltaire performing, and he will once again, be 
crowning this years King and Queen. We'll also be giving away a ton of 
cool prizes, so make sure your mark your calendars.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: korea nuclear tests?!...

  


"the bomb" is black gang member slang for "the best",
bush wants
to go to WWIII, because blacks have acknowledged that
korea has
better breakers and have even conceeded the UN chief
seat?!

but then again the war on iraq was started despite the
fact that
everyone at the UN knew that collin powell presented a
forged
document alleging attempted to obtain "yellow cake"
(yellow
food coloring) to enrich depleted uranium when the
only way
you can enrich depleted uranium with yellow
cake/yellow food
coloring is give it a yellow color!...and this is
despite the fact
that the UN inspectors had gone through the entire CIA
check
list of alleged WMD sites and found nothing
substantial...the
war on iraq has cost america over $300 billion dollars
and almost
3000 US soldiers thier lives and over 100,000 iraqi's
their lives
(many of which were tortured to death trying to find
saddam)
when iraq had nothing to do with 9/11...neither did
afghanistan
for that matter...both countries's people can't get to
america
even if they wanted to since both countries people
have not
had flights to america for ages.

zacharias moussaui, the 20th 9/11 hi-jacker like
yussef ramsey,
the 1993 WTC is from north africa...blacks framed bin
laden
because the bin ladens were formerly bush's largest
investors.
blacks framed bin laden with a 5 year old CNN video of
Bin
Laden that was mistranslated and a video of an old
black man
dressed as Bin Laden for the confession video...FBI
Director
Mueller confessed that half the saudi's pictured on
the FBI
most wanted list for 9/11 turned out to be still alive
and they
had been identity thefted....when the saudi's found
out they
had been framed, they pulled out $200 billion of the
$420 billion
they had invested in America.

bin laden, has never even been to NY let alone have
any flight
knowledge to train anyone to fly a plane let alone fly
a jet plane
with such accuracy to fly it into the WTC the first
try.

these are the facts...al quida jinx kahlil g
robinson's gang after
fleeing to NY and joining the NY Bloods (of which
zacharias
moussaui was associated with) bragged that the WTC
would
be the ultimate insurance scam, California Bloods
associated
with the band the Coupe (based in Oakland, CA)
advertise
blwoing up the WTC on their black gangster hip hop
album
that featured the song "5 million ways to kill a
CEO"...black
gangs protest violently against globalization in
seattle and
new york right before 9/11....9/11 happens...jinx's
mother is
a black panther that had planned on blowing up
buildings in
new york since the 60's as revenge for the
slaughtering of the
initial Black Panther gang...the sign of the Black
Panthers is one
black glove...an individual with one black glove
tossed a grenade
at Bush when he gave a speech in Georgia, former
Soviet
Republic...Jinx's gang was the Folk Nation gang...the
gang
that was caught in LA with the rocket launcher that
was
used to shoot at a plane they thought Bush was in
after
his return trip to China and with a bomb intended to
bomb
the NY subways system with were Folk Nation Gang
members.
Folk Nation Gang members are notorious for trafficking
jamaican
cannibis...jamaican cannibis was what the woman who
crashed
her car into the venue Bush gave his speech in
Philadelphia was
high on...she confessed black gang members had given
her the
cannibis and had told her that Bush was against
pro-choice and
that's why she did it.

blacks are using the same tactic they tricked Bush to
start a war
with Iraq to start a war with N. Korea...using highly
exagerated
intell: "korean b-boy videos", which they call "the
bomb" as intell
for "nuclear underground activity"....this of course
alienates
america's current largest investors japan and china,
which blacks
broadsweep as koreans as well...blacks are very
successfull at
tricking Bush into attacking his largest investors.

keep in black gangs are responsible for 75% of the
homicides in
most major cities, 75% of the armed bank and
convenience store
robberies, 75% of shooting prostitutes for their cash
on hand, and
75% of the car jackings (it doesn't take a rocket
scientist to
figure out they had gone from car jackings to plane
jackings!).

africa is also where deadly diseases: AIDS, anthrax,
ebola,
west nile virus, and e.coli originally came from.

and it is no secret now that the 700 mile border fence
is actually to
keep black gang members out that had been deported,
because our
jails are too full of them now and minutemen are too
tired shooting
at them when they try to get back in...they sort've
did have to 
shoot at them, because most were homicidal maniacs who
tended
to want revenge by burning large parts of california,
texas, oklahoma,
alabama, and tennessee when they did get back in.

jinx was actually prophesized to be one of the
anti-christs according
to nostradamus prophecies: "all friends made by the
adultress lady,
the land dreadful and black of aspect"...layla is
definitly the adultress
lady and jinx is definitly the land dreadful and black
of aspect...the
two false rumor starters that would start the wars
that would lead 
to WWIII.

it is obvious they are full of shit and are obviously
trying to start wars
with multiple nations by them falsely labeling me as:
japanese, 
korean, vietnamese, hmong, mexican, italian mafia,
arab, paki, yemeni, 
etc. to start wars with multiple nations that would of
course lead to 
WWIII.

Subject: {pb-cle} Clearing Up the Dark Tare Lies...

once again disspelling some of the dark tare rumors...

"opium dealer" - asians regard opium as jews regard
swastikas since the emperor hacked heads to get opium
out of china before...but that lie cost the west coast
$125 billion in loss of business during the freezing
of the west coast ports since union port workers 
couldn't work, teamsters truck drivers couldn't work,
and stores like wal-mart couldn't get their inventory
for 125 days at a billion dollars loss of business a
day...turns out black gang members only started the
rumor to confiscate imported goods for themselves or
to sell on the black market.

"yoshi" - there in no yoshi on any FBI most wanted
list...the original WTC
was designed by a japanese architect...the largest
investor in US treasury
bonds are japanese with a $720.8 billion investment,
where FBI pay
check money come from...japanese companies like: Sony,
Toyota, Honda,
Mitsubishi, Panasonic, Yamaha, Technics, Roland, etc.
employ thousands
of Americans

"korean" - i am not korean...i am fourth generation
american born chinese
american...my great grandfather was around when
chinese americans
built the transcontinental railroad in the 1800's, my
grandfather was
around when the chinese theatre was built in the early
1900's, my
father is a reagan era republican, and i was born in
ohio, but have
lived here in cali for almost 4 years now.

"mexican" - i am not mexican...but i did think the 700
mile southern border
fence was a bit excessive and will only deteriorate
diplomatic ties with
mexico and decrease mexican american votes.

"gay" - i have always been heterosexual for as long as
i can remember

"broke/loser" - i made america $1.4 trillion dollars
from japanese and 
chinese investors, but it is in the federal reserve,
and is actually of course 
japan and china's money that they had loaned us...i
have worked 16 years
of my life and i have the tax record to prove it...i
have initiated over two 
dozen movies and over two dozen tv shows from my
internet intelligence
reports....i have posted over 400 world solutions
since 1998.

"player" - i am not married nor do i have a girlfriend
at this time...so it is
impossible for me to be a player.

"alcoholic" - i haven't had an alcohol drink in almost
2 years...although i
do miss beer and wine and might drink again for a
special occasion...i
drink 'root beer' at restaurants and 'oj' the last
time i went to a bar.

'druggie/drug dealer" - i don't even smoke
cigarettes...i have never been
a drug dealer, although i did know a few back in ohio

'undercover' - undercover is when you are used to wear
a wire for a drug
bust, i have never been used to wear a wire for a drug
bust...i write 
real intelligence reports...critical world solutions
for world problems
and west coast homeland security reports.

'rehab' - i have never been in rehab, because i never
had a drug or alcohol problem.
i was in the hospital for a month, but it was supposed
to be for having a 
tea cup thrown at my head and puncture wounds on my
wrists

'rape/murder' - obviously if i had commited either of
those crimes i would be
in jail...i am not in jail, because i have never raped
or killed anyone...i actually live
in an upper middle class neighborhood in california
with predominantly
republican and US military neighbors.

'child porn' - dark tares have spammed me with teen
porn before, but federal
clearly mandates that it is the producer of child
pornography that is the guilty
party, not the recipient...you can forward anyone porn
e-mails including the
president...does it make the president a child
pornographer?...obviously not!

'whoop the asians' - our government would not waste
hard earned tax money
on whooping any race of people...obviously this would
be a dark tare agenda
and not our government, which has more important
things to deal with.

see, sometimes you make sense, but then you go and compare breakdancing with
foreign policy and you just fuck it all up.

i was with you when you sent out your youtube documentary about you getting
a B+ in English, then i opened this up... and it's all wrong.

also 'the bomb' is BLACK gang member slang - because we have to make it as
stereotypical as possible.  Actually "the bomb" came from zero wing.  look
it up.  AYBABTU focker!

(yellow<br>food coloring) to enrich depleted uranium when the<br>only way<br>you can enrich depleted uranium with yellow<br>cake/yellow food<br>coloring is give it a yellow color!...and this is<br>despite the fact<br>that the UN inspectors had gone through the entire CIA
<br>check<br>list of alleged WMD sites and found nothing<br>substantial...the<br>war on iraq has cost america over $300 billion dollars<br>and almost<br>3000 US soldiers thier lives and over 100,000 iraqi's<br>their lives
<br>(many of which were tortured to death trying to find<br>saddam)<br>when iraq had nothing to do with 9/11...neither did<br>afghanistan<br>for that matter...both countries's people can't get to<br>america<br>even if they wanted to since both countries people

A) Stevie please stop with the spam, or at least reply to yourself so
gmail will roll it all up :P

B) as far as "the bomb", it far predates the AYBABTU video, as many
old school pbclers can attest I used it way too much back in the
day... I imagine if you grepped the archives you can see evidence of
this.

c) To keep this on-topic, what parties are all you PBCLEers going to
on the 28th? I think I'm actually gonna hit both get-spooky and
masquerade.

no, i'm pretty sure aybabtu was when it started.  never before in history
had this fragment been used in context such that the prepositional
complement, "the bomb," was used specifically as a noun, instead of its
normal use as a prepositional complement.

also, "The Bomb" was a track made by the bucketheads, but in that context,
The is just the 'determiner' and 'bomb' is the object/noun.

if you're taking me seriously, you need the bomb nut kick.

You're arguing for a musician based on his nickname, dude.

Seriously, I think "E Street Band" has to be a rave-list favorite,
anyways, but come on...

plenty of people are remembered by their name or nickname, not by what they
actually contributed to the world.

it's all perception, because 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000 years from now reality
will be what is construed rather than what is reality.

so still, name 5 other artists that can take a well known phrase/position
and BECOME it.
THE BOSS

when you say who is the artist, even prince usually wont get you any answer
in conversation with the lay person, but you say who is "the boss" and you
get one guy shouting "Springsteen DUDE" and while he's shouting that, some
guy across the room with a mullet yells "Free Bird!"

this segue's great into how if you keep saying you started the rave scene in
ohio for 10 years that eventually it will become the accepted truth.

was leaning towards get spooky too and was thinking along the same lines

Do they call me Bob the Shipwright?  Bob the Architect?  Bob the Fireman?

No.

Yeah, except I doubt Springsteen fans 100 years from now will refer to
him as the Boss.

So *one* person knows, and that gets stomped on by an unrelated
reference?  That doesn't sound like longevity to me, only popularity
of the moment.

But at that point, anyone who cared or mattered in the discussion is
long gone.  :-)

well youngstown now has the aero's (thanks to jim trafficant!)

minor league team.  i think the stadium is behind one of the malls in 
the "burbs" of youngstown.

and YSUs football team was apparently damn popular a few years back when 
tressel was there, i didn't ever make it out to any of the games.  not 
even to tailgate.  shame, i hear the tailgating was rather fun.

you can say what you want about traficant, but i think he was quite possibly
my most favorite politician.  You probably wont see many people make it
'that far up the ladder in government' who are completely the champion of
the people they represent and really could care less about politics and more
about what is reality and what needed done.  I miss watching his saturday
morning show on channel 33 while growing up.  He had great hair.

Subject: {pb-cle} raver day in kennywood park this saturday

i was going to go to driven in dayton, but the more me and bill talked 
about it, raverday in kennywood should be more fun.  would like to hit 
up chimera in cleveland, but it just isn't in the cards.  hope that goes 
well too, luke and meghan keep telling me how sick xyla is.


EVENT UPDATE!! : ) --(PLEASE SEE THE BOTTOM OF THIS DESCRIPTION)

In the spirit of the annual "Raver Day @ Disneyland" that happens every
year in California.... I thought I'd start our own Pittsburgh version of
that! So here it is- Raver Night @ Kennywood Phantom Fright Nights!

Meeting time will be 9pm outside the front gate. Anyone who wants to be
there earlier or come later feel free, (it.s not like ravers are hard to
spot in a crowd!!)hah. Tickets are $19.50 at the door & $16.50 in
advance at Giant Eagle.

More info about Phantom Fright Nights can be found at
www.phantomfrightnights.com

Unfortunately .masks, face paint, and inappropriate costumes are not
permitted. BUT .Strobe lighting is in use.....(They must have known the
ravers were coming!!!)

I hope you can all make it! Spread the word, keep the vibe alive and
come out for a night of spooky amusement park raver fun!!

PLUR ~ April*Star

PS- Also wanted to say to everyone coming to remember to be on "good
behavior"... HAVE FUN but keep in mind it is an amusement park...so
let's not do anything to draw any negative attention to us ravers! Keep
the good vibes up! :)

----------------
AFTERPARTY!!!
ask one of us at kennywood

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: blah - boring stuff =)

i loved trafficant too. local thrift shop got donated a bunch of stuff 
from an office renovation he was doing in the yompton office he had and 
his chair was donated and for sale for 35$

i didn't have the loot and it was gone by the time i came back later w 
it.  oddly it was crooked.  ferreal, it sat off balance

Subject: {pb-cle} milieu - milieu lp [exp041] (a true ambient masterpeice)

EXP041 - MILIEU - MILIEU LP
http://www.experimedia.net/page.php?id=123

Experimedia is very proud to welcome into our catalog, the ever
prolific Milieu's self-titled album. A stunningly beautiful album
destined to be an ambient classic.  Truly one of the greatest ambient
masterpieces since Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works II.  An album
that comforted me through one of the most difficult periods in my
life.  Described by Milieu himself as one of his most personal works
to date.  The story is best told through his own words. -Jeremy Bible

It was the end of the Summer, in 2005, and I had finished a large bulk
of material (Aurora Borealis and Night Currents, most notably) and I
was unsure about the validity of my music at that point. Looking back
on the dozens of hours of material, I was convinced that I was unable
to produce quality music without the aid of a computer. To put myself
to the creative test, I set out to record an album using only the most
basic tools I had when I first began making tapes in 1997...electric
and acoustic guitar, some effects pedals, my Lowrey organ and my
Technics M11 cassette deck. The result turned into one of the most
artistically perfect moments I've ever had, very very personal and
very very real. No frills, just me at home on my original instruments.
I followed these successful sessions immediately with more recordings
in this same approach, which resulted in the Of The Apple and Sun
White Sun albums. The Milieu album remains self-titled because it's
the truest embodiment of who I am as a musician, where I've been, and
how I want to communicate through my work all of these things. It's a
language without words to me. -Milieu

Subject: {pb-cle} Raver Day at Kennywood

Haven't heard about any happenings from the weekend yet.  Curious to
know how driven went.  Went to kennywood and that was great.  Geauga
Lake's fright fest was lame compared to it.  And there's some really
interesting rides there.  ZOMG phantom's revenge.  Going down however
long that second drop is, at night (where you can't see the bottom),
hitting probably 75+ MPH at the bottom, being like 40 degrees outside,
and being in the first car was great.  I think I liked it better than
the millenium force at cedar point, has some funner turns.  Although I
guess millenium force at night would be pretty sweet.

Also we found out why bill 4techno isn't bill 4rollercoasters :D

Abbasso is finally closing its doors for good. Starting at 8ish on 
Friday (October 20) DJs will play for one last run in the cave. 
Come by for one last look and one hella strong Tall Paul.

It's just a building, but I'm sentimental for all the people that 
met there and all the music that spread because of it. Think what 
you will about some of the drama that surrounded the place, but it 
gave a lot of people a chance to meet and grow in the scene.

Hope to see some of you.

Peace.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

HELLHOUSE III

October 28, 2006
Louisville, KY
at the Mellwood Arts Center
$10.00 ($5.00 with costume)

Welcome to the third installment of HELLHOUSE, where we acknowledge the 
Pagan spirit with dance and celebration. Why dance? The dance can seem 
frivolous when suffering seems omnipresent and disaster looms in all 
directions. We maintain that dance in a time of death is an act of 
revolution. And so on October 28th we lead a Danse Macabre spiraling 
into "a deep place" "where the sun is silent." When we get there we will 
find that Eros, the joyous life impulse and Thanatos, the death instinct 
heaven and hell are not at opposite ends of the spectrum. Instead, they 
too are dancing. So come all! Outcasts and angels. The lost and the 
lustful. Come gluttons and heretics. Come all and laugh into the face of 
death The divine comedy.
Musical Talent
MATTHEW DEAR as AUDION

Ghostly / Spectral / M-nus

Matthew DearDisplaying a capacity for styles ranging from rhythmic pop 
to gritty tech-house, Matthew Dear has quickly become one of America's 
most revered electronic producers. Between stunning live performances, 
evolved DJ sets and highly developed recordings, Matthew has perked the 
ears of the industry's best. His debut album under his birth name, Leave 
Luck to Heaven, is sleek minimal techno, containing an extraordinary 
sense of songcraft and an ambient soul; it was given four stars by 
Rolling Stone, amongst dozens of other rave reviews and spots on 
numerous 'Best of 2003' lists. The mini-LP Backstroke garnered similar 
praise in 2004 and served to galvanize his placement amongst the world's 
finest minimal electronic producers. He has more recently adopted the 
Audion alias, which explores a markedly harder edge of his sound, 
suffused with massive beats and sawtooth synth oscillations. Having 
closed out 2004 as XLR8R magazine's "Artist of the Year" in addition to

DEREK PLASLAIKO

Ghostly

Derek PlaslaikoThis year Derek becomes a staple of the HELLHOUSE 
aesthetic. A Midwest favorite for years, now living in New York City. 
Derek Plaslaiko delves into the realm of dance music in which the head 
and body are equally active. The records he plays click and whirl inside 
the brain while the low end keeps the body busy. Mixing lush techno with 
jackin house and a healthy dose of Detroit classics, Plaslaiko is known 
for his creative track selection, seamlessly woven by pin-point mixing 
skills that rival international DJs like Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, 
and Laurent Garnier (all of whom Plaslaiko has shared deck time with). A 
lifelong music obsessive, Plaslaiko began DJing in 1995, becoming a 
regular on Detroits weekend rave circuit. He was a virtual resident at 
the citys legendary Syst3m Poorboy and Analog parties, as well as the 
weekly resident at Motor-Detroits Tuesday night throw-down, Family. 
Derek was invited by Carl Craig to play the inaugural Detroit Electronic 
Music Festival in 2000. In addition to events across the Midwest, he has 
played internationally (in Dresden and Koln) and has taken to the decks 
at clubbing institutions such as Smartbar in Chicago and Tronic 
Treatment in New York City. Plaslaiko has played alongside Josh Wink, 
John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson, Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, 
Ectomorph, Matthew Herbert, Mike Huckaby, Green Velvet, and Luke Slater. 
Trained in the masterful arts of Motown DJing, Derek Plaslaiko is 
heading up yet another wave of Detroit talent poised to rejuvenate 
dancefloors across the globe.
SKL presents:
JASON CLARK AND ROACH

Son of Dog Mini-Reunion

Jason Clark and RoachJason and Roach started playing music together over 
15 years ago, forming the seminal grindcore band Son Of Dog. Years have 
past, and Roach has gone on to travel the world, eventually settling in 
Los Angeles and performing in various bands and performance acts. Last 
year Roach was the featured theremin player on the Ellen Degeneres Show 
Halloween episode, which obviously foiled plans for the reunion at 
HELLHOUSE II. Since last year, Jason and Roach have performed together 
across the country as AUTOBAHN, the fictitious nihilist band from the 
movie The Big Lebowski. Following the Son of Dog years, Jason teamed up 
with an oddball cast of characters, and formed SKL, a group of 
electronic musicians, performance artists, and other artists. He's also 
released quite a few CD's along the way. This won't be a full reunion of 
Son of Dog, because band practice is difficult from 1200 miles away, but 
expect Halloween to be fully represented by these two characters.
THE RIVETER

(aka LADY FOURSQUARE)

The RiveterWith a fall release due on Felix da Housecat's electro-house 
imprint, Rude Photo one thing certain: This Louisville Slugger is NOT 
hitting like a girl. This summer saw the launch of Backbreaker 
Recordings when she became one of a handful of female label owners 
worldwide. With singles from her Body Language (with KDK) project 
landing on hot pick lists globally, the labels first single, Hijack 
broke the top ten on several international charts. Her set at Hellhouse 
III will feature predominantly original tracks and debuts previously 
unheard material for the first time anywhere.
FRANKIE VEGA

Chicago

Frankie VegaCurrently Frankie Vega heads record labels: Blueline, 
Uppercut, Ammo Recordings, Ghetto Test, and is Assistant director of 
Dust Traxx record label. Daily, he manages Distribution for 35 exclusive 
record labels. Frankie is an infectious force spreading awareness of 
artists, record releases and putting their music on the shelves working 
directly with hundreds of store owners and buyers monthly. When the sun 
goes down, Frankie Vega and partners host signature club and ball room 
events such as IN YOUR SYSTEM, BOTS, BIG BANG SESSIONS and other brands 
through promotion company Majestic Night Life.
MOWGLI

Cincinnati

MowgliIn over a decade of dedicating his life to DJing Drum & Bass and 
Jungle, Mowgli has held his ground as a forefather of the sound in the 
Mid-West. Along with Troll, they have been the epitome of excellent DJ's 
with proper knowledge and attitude in and around the Mid-West. As of 
recently, Mowgli has gone back to playing drums and sampling loops. He 
has equipped artists such as A-sides(Eastside/Fuze/Metalheadz), Dylan & 
Facs(Biotic/XXX/OutBreak), MK2(M.A.D.Bass), and Boombip(Mush/Lex) with 
these drum breaks. He is busy being a regular resident at almost every 
club in the Cincinnati area and is now working with Identity, a Native 
Cincinnati Turntablist on a more hip-hop influenced sound while still 
paying homage to Drum & Bass.
The Details

If you have attended HELLHOUSE in the past, you know what to expect. For 
those that haven't, and we expect there will be quite a few, here are 
some general hints to help you survive the evening:

   1. Tonight we dance the dance of Dionysus, the ancient god of wine 
and fertility. Dionysus represents the mystery religions of the world. 
Ecstatic dance, personal delivery from the daily world through spiritual 
intoxication, and initiation into secret rites. We expect you to come 
with an open mind, ready to celebrate the inexpressible wonders of life 
in this universe.
   2. Make no mistake, this is a Halloween costume party. Dress up, play 
the role, go outside yourself. We create this environment and make it 
inexpensive enough for everyone to participate. You are welcome to come 
in the garb of the early 21st century, but we'd much rather have 1000 
super-heros saving the world from the forces of evil.
   3. Being the pagans we are, we needed a virgin to sacrifice for the 
evening to be truely what it needs to be. That virgin will be the 
Mellwood Arts and Entertainment Center, a ten thousand square foot 
warehouse space that's just begging for our type of fun. The venue 
includes a 1400 square foot outdoor balcony as a smoking patio.
   4. Cash bar will be in full effect as late as is legal. The 
intoxication we referred to in item one isn't just spiritual. It is a 
party, after all.
   5. Artists are invited to contribute to the evening by submitting 
large format pieces that symbolize the HellHouse theme. We suggest you 
build or paint something that includes the HellHouse icons: Gene 
Simmons; the colors red, white, and black; and the themes of paganism, 
spiritual ecstacy, and evil. Please email j2@untranslatable.com if you 
would like to contribute.
   6. No Guest List. Period. Nada. The staff even pays. Please don't 
ask.

Alliances

Grotesque Burlesque, Squallis Puppeteers, Art Sanctuary, PRDF, 
BrilliantlyMad, Derby City Rollergirls, Racecar Productions, Backbreaker 
Recordings, Art Sanctuary

We are going out of our way to invite all groups of people to HellHouse 
to participate and make this the largest and best independently run 
Halloween event in the midwest. If you feel like you have something to 
offer, please get in touch!

Sat Nov 18                       ASSDRAGON 4                     Pittsburgh

An epic laptop music battle where the winner gets a 7" record release on
No Room For Talent Records

Free to enter! Not a damn thing to lose!

Once again, the time has come for all electronic musicians in this 
forsaken wasteland to gather on the field of battle to prove their 
worth. Blood will spill and valor will be tested, but in the end, one 
champion will rise through the human wreckage and claim the spoils of 
war.

This competition is free to enter and anyone can join. All you need is 
courage...and a computer.

The Rules
This battle is being waged to see which electronic musician can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. You can only use a laptop or desktop 
computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no traditional 
instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug into the RCA 
input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount of material 
ahead of time and use any software you want, although you are encouraged 
to improvise or create material on the fly. Using material from other 
artists is grounds for removal: this rule is potentially misleading 
since you can use samples. Like the Galactic Ass Dragon Classics before 
it, this is not a Traktor battle: make your own shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many people enter, everyone 
who enters gets a 10 minute time slot in the opening round. There will 
be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, you can start 
setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in front of you is 
done, you're on the clock. Tick tock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 will 
move on to the semi-final round where they will have another 10 minutes 
to flay their competitors. At the completion of the semi-round, the top 
2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 minute shot before one 
glorious winner is crowned. The winner receives the highly coveted 
Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their own 7" record release on No 
Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the legendary No Room for Talent 
Records, Dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.

Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you made people get 
up, holler, and/or pump their fists. Getting the crowd to just gently 
bob their heads or feel your "soulful groove" is not only lame, it isn't 
worth any points. Breakcore, hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise 
are what's called for. Playing well-produced techno, drum and bass, 
trance, house, or downtempo idm will result in zero points and possibly 
the bum's rush. While vocals are not prohibited, may Odin have mercy on 
your soul if you dare to assault us with pitiful singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. Get naked. Do a skit. Anything. The more you distract 
everyone from your awful music, the more points you get. If you look 
like you're checking your email during your lunch break at work, you're 
going to do terrible.

This will be taking place at ON Gallery [5005 Penn Avenue] in Pittsburgh 
PA at 7PM. This event is ALL AGES! $3 cover: everyone who enters the 
competition gets in for free, so if you want to skirt the cover charge, 
contact Dave 8cylinder to lay down the guantlet.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

It's that time of the year again kids! That's right, Gothcoming 2006 is 
just around the corner (Friday, September 22, 2006). Time to dust of 
that tux, dry clean the crinoline and start getting ready for the 
biggest Goth Industrial event of the year!

This year's theme is "Tales from DeCrypt", so you have a lot of 
latitude. It's Gothcoming, so school themes are always in. It's a play 
on words, so you can be Ghetto Goth Fabulous, Undead, or even a Math 
Teacher. Hell, why not do all three?

Once again Outland plays host to our party, and we get to celebrate it's 
first official year at the new location. If you haven't been there yet, 
you really need to check it out!

This is YOUR party so you need to make it the most fun that you can. 
Once again, we have Voltaire performing, and he will once again, be 
crowning this years King and Queen. We'll also be giving away a ton of 
cool prizes, so make sure your mark your calendars.

Thought I'd post this since people always ask if I'm selling mine; NOT.

Found one on ebay.  They used to only be $777 when Jared still made them.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Paladin 5.1 coming to Pittsburgh

Yeah I believe Bounce was the first party John Bromage threw (late 97
or early 98? I forget). My wife Adrienne and I both went to it, but
didn't meet eachother till months later... Kinda funny that Jud's
Bounce is kinda the party that got us interested in moving back to
pittsburgh, and got us in touch with our old friends trout and such.

Anyhow, I'm pretty damn psyched for Paladin 5.1. I hope the turnout
will support bringing him here... especially with such short notice.
I'm also hoping that somehow Jud can have a sweet chillout area like
last year's bounce, because that's really what made that party so
special.

I'd also encourage everyone to wear candy and fairy wings as last year
there was a huge turnout of the two. I think Trout may have even wore
candy :^)

Subject: {pb-cle} No more raves on great wall of china

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20061025/od_uk_nm/oukoe_uk_china_wall

China has banned partying, stunts and other "inappropriate behaviour"  
on the Great Wall to protect one of its top tourist attractions from  
erosion.

The Great Wall, which snakes its way across more than 6,400 km (4,000  
miles), receives an estimated 10 million visitors a year, mostly to  
the mere 10 km opened to tourists at Badaling, the nearest stretch to  
Beijing.

More adventurous visitors climb wilder, crumblier sections that are  
not officially open to the public and stretches near the capital have  
become popular sites for summer raves.

The new rules, issued by the State Council, or China's cabinet,  
prohibit the driving of vehicles on the wall or group activities such  
as parties.

"Inappropriate tourist exploration has caused damage to the Great  
Wall and its historical features," the government's Web site on  
Wednesday cited a State Council official as saying.

Last year, some revellers were "involved in such indecent and illegal  
activities as urinating and drug abuse on the wall", the China Daily  
said earlier of a party that was widely reported and sparked a public  
uproar.

In 1992, a Hong Kong motorcyclist leapt the wall and American David  
Copperfield did his magic stunts there three years later.

"According to the new regulations, this will be considered illegal in  
the future," the Beijing News said.

The regulations also urge local governments to limit numbers of  
visitors to the Great Wall which the United Nations listed as a World  
Heritage Site in 1987.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and

HELLHOUSE III

October 28, 2006
Louisville, KY
at the Mellwood Arts Center
$10.00 ($5.00 with costume)

Welcome to the third installment of HELLHOUSE, where we acknowledge the 
Pagan spirit with dance and celebration. Why dance? The dance can seem 
frivolous when suffering seems omnipresent and disaster looms in all 
directions. We maintain that dance in a time of death is an act of 
revolution. And so on October 28th we lead a Danse Macabre spiraling 
into "a deep place" "where the sun is silent." When we get there we will 
find that Eros, the joyous life impulse and Thanatos, the death instinct 
heaven and hell are not at opposite ends of the spectrum. Instead, they 
too are dancing. So come all! Outcasts and angels. The lost and the 
lustful. Come gluttons and heretics. Come all and laugh into the face of 
death The divine comedy.

MATTHEW DEAR as AUDION

Ghostly / Spectral / M-nus

Matthew DearDisplaying a capacity for styles ranging from rhythmic pop 
to gritty tech-house, Matthew Dear has quickly become one of America's 
most revered electronic producers. Between stunning live performances, 
evolved DJ sets and highly developed recordings, Matthew has perked the 
ears of the industry's best. His debut album under his birth name, Leave 
Luck to Heaven, is sleek minimal techno, containing an extraordinary 
sense of songcraft and an ambient soul; it was given four stars by 
Rolling Stone, amongst dozens of other rave reviews and spots on 
numerous 'Best of 2003' lists. The mini-LP Backstroke garnered similar 
praise in 2004 and served to galvanize his placement amongst the world's 
finest minimal electronic producers. He has more recently adopted the 
Audion alias, which explores a markedly harder edge of his sound, 
suffused with massive beats and sawtooth synth oscillations. Having 
closed out 2004 as XLR8R magazine's "Artist of the Year" in addition to 
appearances at Mutek, Coachella, and Fabric (London) Dear now turns to 
Audion for Fall 2005's Suckfish LP and further touring around the world. 
Plans for 2006 include a full-length follow-up to Leave Luck to Heaven 
that will further trace the evolution of the distinct Matthew Dear 
sound.
DEREK PLASLAIKO

Ghostly

Derek PlaslaikoThis year Derek becomes a staple of the HELLHOUSE 
aesthetic. A Midwest favorite for years, now living in New York City. 
Derek Plaslaiko delves into the realm of dance music in which the head 
and body are equally active. The records he plays click and whirl inside 
the brain while the low end keeps the body busy. Mixing lush techno with 
jackin house and a healthy dose of Detroit classics, Plaslaiko is known 
for his creative track selection, seamlessly woven by pin-point mixing 
skills that rival international DJs like Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, 
and Laurent Garnier (all of whom Plaslaiko has shared deck time with). A 
lifelong music obsessive, Plaslaiko began DJing in 1995, becoming a 
regular on Detroits weekend rave circuit. He was a virtual resident at 
the citys legendary Syst3m Poorboy and Analog parties, as well as the 
weekly resident at Motor-Detroits Tuesday night throw-down, Family. 
Derek was invited by Carl Craig to play the inaugural Detroit Electronic 
Music Festival in 2000. In addition to events across the Midwest, he has 
played internationally (in Dresden and Koln) and has taken to the decks 
at clubbing institutions such as Smartbar in Chicago and Tronic 
Treatment in New York City. Plaslaiko has played alongside Josh Wink, 
John Acquaviva, Kevin Saunderson, Richardo Villalobos, Baby Ford, 
Ectomorph, Matthew Herbert, Mike Huckaby, Green Velvet, and Luke Slater. 
Trained in the masterful arts of Motown DJing, Derek Plaslaiko is 
heading up yet another wave of Detroit talent poised to rejuvenate 
dancefloors across the globe.
SKL presents:
JASON CLARK AND ROACH

Son of Dog Mini-Reunion

Jason Clark and RoachJason and Roach started playing music together over 
15 years ago, forming the seminal grindcore band Son Of Dog. Years have 
past, and Roach has gone on to travel the world, eventually settling in 
Los Angeles and performing in various bands and performance acts. Last 
year Roach was the featured theremin player on the Ellen Degeneres Show 
Halloween episode, which obviously foiled plans for the reunion at 
HELLHOUSE II. Since last year, Jason and Roach have performed together 
across the country as AUTOBAHN, the fictitious nihilist band from the 
movie The Big Lebowski. Following the Son of Dog years, Jason teamed up 
with an oddball cast of characters, and formed SKL, a group of 
electronic musicians, performance artists, and other artists. He's also 
released quite a few CD's along the way. This won't be a full reunion of 
Son of Dog, because band practice is difficult from 1200 miles away, but 
expect Halloween to be fully represented by these two characters.
THE RIVETER

(aka LADY FOURSQUARE)

The RiveterWith a fall release due on Felix da Housecat's electro-house 
imprint, Rude Photo one thing certain: This Louisville Slugger is NOT 
hitting like a girl. This summer saw the launch of Backbreaker 
Recordings when she became one of a handful of female label owners 
worldwide. With singles from her Body Language (with KDK) project 
landing on hot pick lists globally, the labels first single, Hijack 
broke the top ten on several international charts. Her set at Hellhouse 
III will feature predominantly original tracks and debuts previously 
unheard material for the first time anywhere.
FRANKIE VEGA

Chicago

Frankie VegaCurrently Frankie Vega heads record labels: Blueline, 
Uppercut, Ammo Recordings, Ghetto Test, and is Assistant director of 
Dust Traxx record label. Daily, he manages Distribution for 35 exclusive 
record labels. Frankie is an infectious force spreading awareness of 
artists, record releases and putting their music on the shelves working 
directly with hundreds of store owners and buyers monthly. When the sun 
goes down, Frankie Vega and partners host signature club and ball room 
events such as IN YOUR SYSTEM, BOTS, BIG BANG SESSIONS and other brands 
through promotion company Majestic Night Life.
MOWGLI

Cincinnati

MowgliIn over a decade of dedicating his life to DJing Drum & Bass and 
Jungle, Mowgli has held his ground as a forefather of the sound in the 
Mid-West. Along with Troll, they have been the epitome of excellent DJ's 
with proper knowledge and attitude in and around the Mid-West. As of 
recently, Mowgli has gone back to playing drums and sampling loops. He 
has equipped artists such as A-sides(Eastside/Fuze/Metalheadz), Dylan & 
Facs(Biotic/XXX/OutBreak), MK2(M.A.D.Bass), and Boombip(Mush/Lex) with 
these drum breaks. He is busy being a regular resident at almost every 
club in the Cincinnati area and is now working with Identity, a Native 
Cincinnati Turntablist on a more hip-hop influenced sound while still 
paying homage to Drum & Bass.
The Details

If you have attended HELLHOUSE in the past, you know what to expect. For 
those that haven't, and we expect there will be quite a few, here are 
some general hints to help you survive the evening:

   1. Tonight we dance the dance of Dionysus, the ancient god of wine 
and fertility. Dionysus represents the mystery religions of the world. 
Ecstatic dance, personal delivery from the daily world through spiritual 
intoxication, and initiation into secret rites. We expect you to come 
with an open mind, ready to celebrate the inexpressible wonders of life 
in this universe.
   2. Make no mistake, this is a Halloween costume party. Dress up, play 
the role, go outside yourself. We create this environment and make it 
inexpensive enough for everyone to participate. You are welcome to come 
in the garb of the early 21st century, but we'd much rather have 1000 
super-heros saving the world from the forces of evil.
   3. Being the pagans we are, we needed a virgin to sacrifice for the 
evening to be truely what it needs to be. That virgin will be the 
Mellwood Arts and Entertainment Center, a ten thousand square foot 
warehouse space that's just begging for our type of fun. The venue 
includes a 1400 square foot outdoor balcony as a smoking patio.
   4. Cash bar will be in full effect as late as is legal. The 
intoxication we referred to in item one isn't just spiritual. It is a 
party, after all.
   5. Artists are invited to contribute to the evening by submitting 
large format pieces that symbolize the HellHouse theme. We suggest you 
build or paint something that includes the HellHouse icons: Gene 
Simmons; the colors red, white, and black; and the themes of paganism, 
spiritual ecstacy, and evil. Please email j2@untranslatable.com if you 
would like to contribute.
   6. No Guest List. Period. Nada. The staff even pays. Please don't 
ask.

Alliances

Grotesque Burlesque, Squallis Puppeteers, Art Sanctuary, PRDF, 
BrilliantlyMad, Derby City Rollergirls, Racecar Productions, Backbreaker 
Recordings, Art Sanctuary

We are going out of our way to invite all groups of people to HellHouse 
to participate and make this the largest and best independently run 
Halloween event in the midwest. If you feel like you have something to 
offer, please get in touch!

Sat Nov 18                       ASSDRAGON 4                     Pittsburgh

An epic laptop music battle where the winner gets a 7" record release on
No Room For Talent Records

Free to enter! Not a damn thing to lose!

Once again, the time has come for all electronic musicians in this 
forsaken wasteland to gather on the field of battle to prove their 
worth. Blood will spill and valor will be tested, but in the end, one 
champion will rise through the human wreckage and claim the spoils of 
war.

This competition is free to enter and anyone can join. All you need is 
courage...and a computer.

The Rules
This battle is being waged to see which electronic musician can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. You can only use a laptop or desktop 
computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no traditional 
instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug into the RCA 
input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount of material 
ahead of time and use any software you want, although you are encouraged 
to improvise or create material on the fly. Using material from other 
artists is grounds for removal: this rule is potentially misleading 
since you can use samples. Like the Galactic Ass Dragon Classics before 
it, this is not a Traktor battle: make your own shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many people enter, everyone 
who enters gets a 10 minute time slot in the opening round. There will 
be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, you can start 
setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in front of you is 
done, you're on the clock. Tick tock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 will 
move on to the semi-final round where they will have another 10 minutes 
to flay their competitors. At the completion of the semi-round, the top 
2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 minute shot before one 
glorious winner is crowned. The winner receives the highly coveted 
Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their own 7" record release on No 
Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the legendary No Room for Talent 
Records, Dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.

Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you made people get 
up, holler, and/or pump their fists. Getting the crowd to just gently 
bob their heads or feel your "soulful groove" is not only lame, it isn't 
worth any points. Breakcore, hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise 
are what's called for. Playing well-produced techno, drum and bass, 
trance, house, or downtempo idm will result in zero points and possibly 
the bum's rush. While vocals are not prohibited, may Odin have mercy on 
your soul if you dare to assault us with pitiful singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. Get naked. Do a skit. Anything. The more you distract 
everyone from your awful music, the more points you get. If you look 
like you're checking your email during your lunch break at work, you're 
going to do terrible.

This will be taking place at ON Gallery [5005 Penn Avenue] in Pittsburgh 
PA at 7PM. This event is ALL AGES! $3 cover: everyone who enters the 
competition gets in for free, so if you want to skirt the cover charge, 
contact Dave 8cylinder to lay down the guantlet.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Just when you thought it was safe...

"UnSilent Film" celebrates its Second Anniversary with a showing of "Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" on Monday, October 30th at The Hi-Fi Concert Club 
at 8pm.

The 1920 classic silent horror film (directed by John S. Robertson), is
based on the famous story by Robert Louis Stevenson. Starring John
Barrymore (grandfather of actress Drew Barrymore) who chews up the
scenery in the dual role as the conflicted Dr. Henry Jekyll/Mr. Edward
Hyde.

This version received high marks when it was released -- Variety
proclaimed it "a fine dignified presentation... the appearance of John
Barrymore in any production is an event and there remains for the
reviewer only to comment on how excellent is his portrayal of the dual
personalities of the unfortunate Dr. Jekyll." The New York Times agreed:
"something special and extraordinary... in Mr. Barrymore's flawless
performance."

Though many interpretations followed over the years, it is Barrymore's
portrayal (much like Max Schreck's in "Nosferatu") that stays lodged in
the dreams of the collective unconscious.

"UnSilent Film" -- a series of silent movies preformed with an
improvised live score -- will be performed this time by Thieves Like Me,
fluxmonkey, tofu, Shawn Holt, Geo Jones and Steven K. Smith.

The Hi-Fi Concert Club is located at 11729 Detroit Ave., Lakewood, OH
(216) 521-8878.

The demo scene up their started... a lot of things. I think Assembly  
is still listed as a demo party, not a LAN party, although I think  
the idea of the demo party probably spawned the lan party. I can't  
even believe the amount of people they pack in a stadium up there  
with their pc's... yeah... stadium. Check out the pics (yes, pics or  
stfu ) http://www.assembly.org/2006/asm/gallery/

It's impossible to actually describe the demoscene, but the wikipedia  
does a pretty good job:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_scene

 From gaming, to software piracy, to electronic music, to everyday  
crap on your cell phone, the demoscene probably had something to do  
with starting it. I think some of the first and best old school rave  
tracks I ever heard were sampled remixes done on an amiga. Actually,  
a little googling found me the U4ia treasure cache: http:// 
mod.zayda.net/. Check out some of Jim Young's stuff as F8 to see what  
I mean.

And yes, as BS can attest to, I downloaded all this crap with the  
help of uudecode, the cleveland freenet, and a lot of time as a high  
school kid. Funny I was downloading music before most people knew  
what email was.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Boten Anna

Haha sounds similar to me... Calling long distance BBSs in '88 by
dialing up pitt's lat service and 'c dialout' with their free long
distance dialer... Maybe you ran into my bbs at some point? Rolling
thunder. Used to be part of a pirate oriented ring in Pittsburgh along
with Milliways, Visionary, and I forget the name of the bbs 'farmer
pete' ran... Kicking ass on tradewars... all that stuff. At some point
todd and kristin who ran milliways (a 6 line BBS on a C=64 no less)
asked me to go in with them on a startup internet service provider...
I didn't have time because I had just gotten my dream job so I said
no... later they became LM.com and made an assload of cash... my bad.

At any rate, alot of my love for techno came from old 8-bit Atari and
C=64 demos circa 1984. I often wonder how many people were similarly
affected? I also wonder if the poplularity of beeps and bleeps that
still appears in techno was due to the fact that the really old school
techno found in demos on 8 bits was really only capable of doing
bleeps and beeps.

The good ole days.

Didn't take many pictures, got tired towards the end.  I was surprised
astral projection was really good.  The basslines were sick, first time
I've ever "heard" sub-bass (yeah I know you can't really hear it) in a
big system.

Subject: {pb-cle} naked teens in Parma?

um?
http://www.smalltownmisfit.com/archives/893


    The Naked TV Smasher <http://www.smalltownmisfit.com/archives/893>

Parma, OH
A well-meaning West Ridgewood Drive woman learned a lesson the hard way 
when she invited a naked teen into her home for a meal.

The woman, 56, told police she was watching TV about 7 p.m. Sunday when 
she heard a noise in her front yard. She went outside to find a naked 
male, breaking potted plants.

She asked him why he had no clothes, and if he was cold or hungry. He 
said he was, so she invited him in to give him food and shelter, a 
report said.

Once inside, though, the suspect walked over to her 24-inch TV, picked 
it up and threw it to the ground, breaking it.

The woman then called police. The suspect had run away from Parmadale, 
the report said.

A vandal damaged a car on Virginia Avenue last week by spray-painting it 
with purple paint.

Oh, and....

{ahem}

Residents of Parma and the surrounding Cleveland suburbs...

Do not fear.

Alan will be arriving shortly to subdue any and all nude teens
prowling the streets of your neighborhood. Do not be alarmed. Please
stay in your houses, and stock up on water-based lubricants, in case
he should knock on your door.

Sincerely,
Parma P.D.
