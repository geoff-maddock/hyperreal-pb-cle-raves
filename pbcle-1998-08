At 12:30 after a phat set by punisher , G0tier (sorry), gauthier took to
the stage.  He had a great consitent set.  He took massivley from pearls
world, by underworld, pink floyd, something sounding like a porno movie, a 
computer saying " Shave my pussy  in various voices , and what sounded
like text to an english movie.  Hells yeah! A tight woven set of almost
non stop speed jungle.  Fantasic!!!!!!

Thanks to all the people spending time with him before his set, he seemed
to love cleveland! 
props to phryl he had on the sticker for his whole set
teknova, care to add anything?
plur
jeffrey :)

PS cleveland kids r0ck :-)

	An AMAZING show.  Thank you to all involved.  The music was just
absolutely crazy.  I had never heard someone keep the crowd up for so
long.  Just when you thought the buildup could get no higher, it did. :)
I heard a rumor from some crazy teacher ;) that he once spun for 8
straight hours, and just seeing him made me totally belive it.  Looking at
Robert de la Gautier was lookin' at a guy who truly LOVED every second of
what he was doing.  Big smiles, playing off the crowd.  I'd also never
seen that much of the 'trilogy crowd' staying till the very end!  A
beautiful sight.
	...a sight just as beautiful, leaning up against the first speaker
doin' my little head-bob-thingy, looking up and seeing Gautier going nuts
not 6 feet away from me, and then looking over to the crowd closest to him
on the dance floor and seeing in consist of like 10-15 net ravahs dancing 
their asses off. :) Really made me happy to see all these great people
I've met just having a killer time in such a great environment. Smiles to
and from everybody.
	Thank you Casey for the ride, you probably saved Dave from
sleeping under a bridge...begging the passeby for painkillers and
ciggarettes! :) Thank you Braden for the Blowpop...and that HYSTERICAL
conversation ;).  And thanks to all the new people I've met...just for
being you...that sounds damn cheesy, but it's true.  I really...really
enjoy the company of everybody I meet of this list.  Such a diversified,
interesting, friendly group.  Can't wait to see you all again...:)

I'm going on vacation tomorrow and won't be back for two or three weeks.  I
hope you all can survive without my ingenious e-mails or inspiring presence in
real life.  I will unsubscribe from the pb-cle list as soon as I can figure
out how, so if you feel compelled to communicate with me just send it to me
directly.  But don't flood my mailbox with  love letters while I'm gone
because I won't be able to keep up with all of my groupies on the road.
However, it has been "real" and "informative".

"you want the truth...you couldn't handle the truth..."

[begin fwd'ed text]

<<THE SAME SONG

Would an agency of the US government actually sell drugs to 
its own citizen?  That's what many shocked African Americans 
have asked after reading about the SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS' 
explosive series of articles that blew the rotting lid off 
America's so called War on Drugs. In the wake of the MERCURY 
NEWS' expose, many African American leaders have gone ballistic.  
And with good reason.  After all, it has been mostly black men 
in the US who have become hooked on crack and who fill today's 
prisons in disproportionate number.
   But Afican Americans shouldn't take the CIA's latest fiasco
personally. A look at the history of the CIA during the past 35 
years-or at least that history that has become public-will reveal 
that the agency has been a color-blind, equal oppurtunity employer 
when it comes to drug trafficking and drug abuse.  Hiding behind a 
cloak of secrecy and with little government adminstration, the CIA 
has been a part of the problem, not the solution, in the War on 
Drugs.
   And contrary to denials by the CIA and its supporters, there is 
evidence to support this charge.  During the Vietnamese War, for
example, the CIA turned a blind eye to South Vietnamese leaders,
such as President Nyguyen Van Thieu, who were up to their eyeballs
in the heroin-trafficking that hooked thousands of American GIs,
many of whom were black.  In fact, the cIA strongly defended Thieu 
and company, knowing full well of their drug-dealing activities.
   Thieu is now reportedly living the good life in Boston, 
Massacusetts, but in the early 1970s, many black GIs who served 
their countries in the unfriendly jungles of Vietnam went home as
addicts.  They becmae 'proof' of the so called GI heroin epidemic 
that led to President Nixon's declaration of a war on drugs in 
1972.
   A decade later, during Jimmy Carter's presidential adinistration,
the CIA got involved in weapons shipments to Afghanistan rebels-
the Mujabeddin-who were fighting the country's pro-Soviet 
government. Afghanistan was-and still is-one of the world's leading 
opium producers, and much of the territory where the opium poppy 
crop was being grown was under Mujabeddin control.  Sure enough, 
heroin soon began flooding the US, sending the number of drug-related deaths
soaring in many cities.
   Then, in 1980, a coup took place during the leftist government 
of Bolivia's reign.  Bolivia was a prime producer of the cocoa plant 
used in cocaine production, and knowledgeable insiders called it the
'cocaine coup', because it was funded by Bolivian drug growers who
were backed by-surprise-the CIA.
    In 1989, the US invaded Panama and kidnapped General Manuel
Noriega, who was at the time the US's number one bogeyman in the
War on Drugs.  Noriega was tried and convicted in a US court and 
is now behind bars for life.  What was the fact that the CIA had 
tolerated the general's drug-related activities for more than 15 
years before his incarceration because he was a good ally against Communism.
   Then, three years ago, the US Justice Department revealed that 
in 1990 and 1991, a special Venezuelan anit-drug unit, funded by 
the CIA, smuggled more than 2,000 pounds of cocaine would, no doubt, 
want to give it another name.
   These disturbing chapters in the history of CIA may just be the 
tip of the iceberg given the secrecy and the lack of control the US
government has over the agency.
   A decade ago, James Mills, in his brilliant expose of inter-
national drug trafficking, THE INVISIBLE EMPIRE, called the War on 
Drugs 'a joke,' and charged that the CIA was the biggest factor in 
the undermining of US efforts to combat drug trafficking and drug-
abuse. Well, it's 1997 and the Cold War is over, but few US-selected 
leaders have shown the intestinal fortitude to move and reign in
the CIA.  Until someone makes the Agency accountable for its actions,
the War on Drugs will continue to be the longest-running sick joke
in American history.
---Ron Chepesiuk>>

This article appeared in the May 1997 issue of PLAYERS magazine
(yup, a porn zine...yup, i read the articles) along with an 
extensively detailed account on how the CIA was involved in the
introduction of crack cocaine to the urban ghettos of South
Central Los Angeles in the early 80's.

This post was not meant to undermine the government (especially
when those employed at those critical times are no longer in 
power now (and the majority of those employed are simply following
orders), but to point out the fact that history is important 
(whether certain members of the list may dislike you for believing 
this or not) and that our system is imperfect...Granted there is 
very little any one on this list can do about it now...But eventually
(probably when we get our heads out of our asses and REALLY notice 
the world around us (of course we might have to get off the drugs 
first)) there will be a time when a select few from our generation 
will have to make critical decision concerning our country's future
...and hopefully this elite few will go the distance and research all 
the facts and have enough common sense to learn from the mistakes of 
our elders and make strides to improve things in a just and efficient
manner.

Hey kids, I'm sorry I missed posting it on the list last week, but Feelgood
made a speacial appearance last week at Elevations in Cincy, and for those of
you who missed it, you really missed out. Lemme just tell you how much my body
hated me. I haven't danced that hard in a *long* time, as I had gotten into
the bad habit of socializing more at parties than dancing (bad news). Luckily
for me though, last week kicked my butt in gear and I realized that I need to
get back to what brought me into this scene in the first place, that being the
music and the non-stopbody rockin dancing ;) 

ANYWAYS, this week Bob is bringing Aphrodite to the club. I think either Troll
and/or Mogli will be throwing down too....but I forget which one.  Needless to
say, this ought to be well worth the trip out :) If anyone is interested in
coming down, you can email me and I can give you the info line number (as it
alludes me at this very moment). Hope to see some of you other kids out there
next week :)

i had just about givin up on seein the beastie boys this time around, when i
learned that the only tickects available in cleveland were behind the
stage...and while seeing mike d's left but cheek would be kind hard(i mean
c'mon its still mike d) it would be worth all that loot and a drive to
cle........then the rov tells me that there is a b-boys show in pgh on the
18th, while this would make me estatic, im not ready to buy in....no
advertiment....or anouncement.......im skeptical.  can some one confirm or
deny this rumor for me and as always if i like your answer there just may be a
big juicy kiss on the lips in it for you.......thanx

Well Damn,,, have to say I had a pretty f*&%in good time too. :-) Havent
danced that much since...hmmm...probably Family Affair 3. My body STILL hurts.
(yeah probably that age thing, but maybe I should just credit Robert for
that?) ;-)  I loved seeing everyone get so MOVED by one person on stage. He
moved HIMSELF, and that I think was what was so contagious. To those of you
who went (a good portion of that list was there), I hope you had even half as
much fun as I did... to those of you who didnt, well, he's young, he'll be
back I am sure!!!!! ;-)  Let's do it again!!! Love, Casey
Some memorable quotes from Friday night: 

Reynard "He asked us if we were narks!"
JBrick    "Do you think we can keep him going til tomorrow morning?"
Some guy from South Africa "Can you help me find a club around here?" ;-)
My friend Jackie (about Robert de La) "Wow, Case, he's CUTE!!! I'm glad I
came!"

<< An AMAZING show.  Thank you to all involved.  The music was just
 absolutely crazy.  I had never heard someone keep the crowd up for so
 long.  Just when you thought the buildup could get no higher, it did. :)
 I heard a rumor from some crazy teacher ;) that he once spun for 8
 straight hours, and just seeing him made me totally belive it.  Looking at
 Robert de la Gautier was lookin' at a guy who truly LOVED every second of
 what he was doing.  Big smiles, playing off the crowd.  I'd also never
 seen that much of the 'trilogy crowd' staying till the very end!  A
 beautiful sight.
 	...a sight just as beautiful, leaning up against the first speaker
 doin' my little head-bob-thingy, looking up and seeing Gautier going nuts
 not 6 feet away from me, and then looking over to the crowd closest to him
 on the dance floor and seeing in consist of like 10-15 net ravahs dancing 
 their asses off. :) Really made me happy to see all these great people
 I've met just having a killer time in such a great environment. Smiles to
 and from everybody.
 	Thank you Casey for the ride, you probably saved Dave from
 sleeping under a bridge...begging the passeby for painkillers and
 ciggarettes! :) Thank you Braden for the Blowpop...and that HYSTERICAL
 conversation ;).  And thanks to all the new people I've met...just for
 being you...that sounds damn cheesy, but it's true.  I really...really
 enjoy the company of everybody I meet of this list.  Such a diversified,
 interesting, friendly group.  Can't wait to see you all again...:)

hey boys and girlies!  i'm new on this list, just subscribed today.  i'm 
not real big on the scene because i'm a single mom and babysitters are 
hard to come by, but i go to any party i can.  saw robert de la gautier 
in cleveland (my home town) on firday.  the music was great, but i think 
that i will skip the next trilogy event (unless it's a name i can't pass 
up).  between the hoochie mamas, the rico sauves and the artificial 
smoke (that shit hurts my lungs!!) i didn't have the room to move.  i 
still danced my ass off and had a great time.  met some really great 
kids from pittsburgh and brought them home to kick it here, since we 
couldn't find an after.  me and my crew are thinkin of hittin a party in 
pb on friday, if we can find a babysitter(there's always that!)  maybe 
i'll see you there!

Thats why I just started asking people what would you classify this style as? When I hear a particularly catching beat or style.

ok..  i'm not quite as up on electronica sub-categories as i'd like to
be...  is there somewhere i can go for a definitive definition (is that
redundant?  probably) of gabber, dark, and techstep?  these are just
some classifications that i've heard, but really don't know what they
are... i'm sure i've heard music of these styles, but just never
classified them as such..

     ok, i just woke up after getting back from columbus
     at about 8am this morning. i would like to thank
     the pepsi-cola corporation for providing the world
     with the drink 'mountain dew' (aka the water of life)
     as it has saved my little geek ass numerous times on
     the interstates of life.

     um, yeah.

     well, to make a long story somewhat short, this 
     weekend i intended to go to columbus and catch 
     sky-high and rapture in sucession, and hang out with
     some of my friends down there. in passing i mentioned
     this to kelly [downlow] and she asked me if i could
     take dj KGB (a german dj who was flying in for the
     event) down to columbus from pgh for sky-high. i
     said that i could, and worked out the details with
     viktor [two tiger productions]. in any case, about
     an hour before i was supposed to pick him up, i got
     a call from viktor saying that KGB's flights were 
     messed up and he was flying direct to columbus. so
     i hung around for a couple of hours, then set off
     for columbus.

     due to heinous construction, it took an extra 45
     minutes to get to the party, and we got there around
     10pm. i said hi to viktor, he seemed like a really 
     nice guy, ultra-professional and very friendly, and
     he gave myself and my friend valentina VIP passes.

     the venue for sky-high was pretty surreal. it was
     at an armory, in a massive vehicle storage room with
     a hardened concrete surface and a high ceiling. it
     was a no-smoking [federal] facility and thus re-entry 
     was permitted. basically, it was a beautiful setup.
     the sound was huge, stacks of JBL's biggest and best
     with wizard workshops's subs along the walls. there
     were about 12 intelligent fixtures in front and a
     projector with a playstation (!) in the back.

     the sad part of this all is: nobody showed. 

     i started getting a really bad feeling about 11pm
     when there were maybe 10 kids there total, and it went
     from bad to worse as the night went on. i think maybe
     250 ppl showed maximum in a place that could have held
     at least 2000.

     the talent there was undeniable. none of the names 
     were familiar to me (perhaps 'cause he imported half
     the people) but the poor dj's were playing to 
     themselves. the only nice thing was that i could stand
     all by myself in front of the tables (or beside them)
     and talk to the djs. notable: rob rave, really tight
     techno, and jez johnson, house to fucking _die_ for, 
     straight from england. it was enough to make you cry.

     anyway. my friend 'mr. booty' jason set up his tables
     and sound outside in back, and laid down a nicely acid
     groove, laid-back electro, stuff you never hear in pgh.

     people in camo uniform started showing up around 6am,
     so it was time to shut down the party. we said goodbye
     to viktor (who took the whole thing really well) and
     left for jason's place in cincinnati.

     i have to say that viktor displayed a level of competence
     and professionalism that seems to be pretty rare in
     promoters. i asked this cutie working the door what his
     last party was and she said it was in russia. um, ok. i
     think their scene is a little different there. the guy
     knows how to throw a party, but is well out of touch with
     the midwest party scene, or, more importantly, the kids.

     why it didn't work: there were nowhere near enough flyers,
     and they weren't big enough or good enough, and they 
     didn't flyer parties immediately previous. also: no name
     recognition. you can't bring an entire cast of strangers,
     even if they are the best europe has to offer, to a party
     and expect us uninformed unadventurous party kids to come.

     anyway...

     spent a _really_ mellow day coming down in cincinnati. 
     that city seems almost less alive than pittsburgh. it looks
     nice, though.

     it was about 11:30pm before we dragged ourselves off for
     rapture. a combination of good traffic and 90 mph got us 
     there at 12:45 or so, and when we got out of the car we
     were definitely ready to party.

     in two words: bad venue.

     in more than two words: well, the indoor space was maybe
     15ft by 80ft, and then the outdoor space was cold as 
     purgatory and about as nice to dance on. gravel, anyone?

     the sound was slamming, though, and the lights adequate.

     however, the crowd wasn't very happy, everyone seemed to
     be sitting on the ground outside. we were tired (esp. me)
     hungry and serotonin-depleted. the pills we got were 
     _really_ poor, and barely woke us up. so we walked out
     around 4am. i kinda wanted to listen to all of the djs,
     but the people running the party didn't even know the
     lineup, and i wasn't in an objective mood anyway.

     i have never felt that happy walking away from a party.
     the vibe was really poor, and we were, well, disappointed.
     i unlocked the car, and the radio came on, and i started
     dancing. valentina just laughed at me. you can't party
     in an unfriendly place, i guess.

     so: two parties, the first very well done with a cool
     venue and mad talent, and the second poorly done with
     decent talent and a horrible venue. the first was badly
     promoted and the second well promoted.

     we had fun, though, with a little help from our chemical
     friends. we left with a healthy skepticism toward the 
     columbus scene, and a strong reinforcement of the knowledge
     that it's the people that make the party. 

     but you also can't have a party where there's nowhere to
     dance.

     um, that's about it. 
     hugs
     geekboy

hey kids!  thought you might like a poem today.  if any of you  out 
there have any to share with me, you know where i am.

                                     --alethea


it would seem
that we live some perverse ideal 
of planned obsolesense.
we put our chips up
knowing we gamble for a transitory wealth.
we grab and grope, 
camcorders in hand
(take advantage of all technology can sell you!)
to make some record
that will stand in place
of the extended warantee.
 
i'll take the floor model.
don't wrap it -- i'll wear it home
in all its crisp and shiny newness.
wrap me in it;
i'll stay in it until its fibers rot from use
and its circuits poke
the tender flesh of our breasts.
i'll live eat sleep breath
the purpose of my purchase.
i'll own it completely --
mind body soul and bowel --
before i let it go.
is there time?
can the worship make a day into a year into a lifetime
before it falls apart
and we scurry for for replacement parts;
try to make it new again.
this modern worship 
(all hail microsoft, oh bill our god hedonistic!)
fears me.
fears -- i will fix anything
everything-- i like this one, 
won't buy another.
product loyalty is my virtue of choice. 
i negate virtue with sin;
i am patient!
i'll wait years for the part i need,
going without
or making do; 
a clever blasphemous hymn.
i won't
patch the scratched brilliance
with a slipshod coat of latex.
madison avenue writes the bible
that i have read 
and refused.
they persist --
it's new it's different it's sweeter smelling longer lasting bigger 
    better more 20% free with purchase.
get that out in one thin breath and they'll ordane you -- minister
    of commercial.
 
but i won't have it.
none for me, thanks.
shut the beady little stares of gaping disbelief
back in their cardboard boxes.
i'll hang with what i have.
none for me, no thank you.
shelve the products 
or send them back.
i'll hang with what i have.
none for me, i'm cool man.
broken battered or beat to shit,
i'll hang with what i have.

All the way over in Cincinnati? Geez...you make it seem like we're in the
boonies ;) j/k, anyways...this party is definately going to be something to
remember. 

Any questions you might have regarding the party, you can either post them or
mail them to me directly. I'll be glad to answer anything that I can, with
handy flyer in hand, or else I can always call up my friends (who happen to be
throwing the party ;) And ask them. 

By the way, did I mention that the night of Sensual is my 21st birthday :)
Come down and celebrate, yo :)

ack!...dats rob RAGE!...not rob rave!...aka rob oglesby...multiple eargazm
productions...integrated records...how totally disrespectful!...i think half 
the kids didn't have half a clue that it was he along with mary watts
(now residing in san francisco) that pretty much blew up the columbus 
rave scene when they threw BIOSPHERE back in 1994...(but then again even 
less kids remember even who i am...hmm mebbe dats why these promotors
didn't have me on the guestlist!)...

actually tight, doesn't even begin to describe this man's skills...he usually 
spins on three turntables!...his set o deep intelligent techno w/ the perfect
blend o dark acidic overtones blew me away!...the only dissapointing part for 
me was that i was so tired (i can't even describe how awful it is to work 12 
hour days from 7:30am to 7:30pm as an account executive...mebbe dats why 
i'm gonna change jobs again!) from work that i dozed off near the end of his
set!...he was, i believe, a surprise last minute substitute for doug aka dj
doughboy, who had to spin @ the red zone the same night...it's been awhile
since i've seen rob spin out, so it was a special treat for me...especially
since recently he has been too busy working on records & working full time
at his music equipment store to do out of town gigs...

<<why it didn't work: there were nowhere near enough flyers,
     and they weren't big enough or good enough, and they 
     didn't flyer parties immediately previous. also: no name
     recognition. you can't bring an entire cast of strangers,
     even if they are the best europe has to offer, to a party
     and expect us uninformed unadventurous party kids to come.>>

here's the real reason why the party didn't work...the flyers
were so poorly done that most o the kids thought the party 
wuz at the red zone...when in reality, the party was actually
the afterhours for the red zone...and dats what truly killed
this party...it just did not make any business sense to have
this party as an afterparty for a club event AND on top of
that charge $15 for an after-party event...granted u got a
$5 discount if u went to red zone, but still that's quite a
price tag for two headliners and the rest locals...actually
i am a li'l disturbed by the lack of business and marketing
skills of many of the local promotors...it's like they plan to
lose money!...i mean, i think here are some basic things that
i thought most promotors knew about:

1) you've got to have a decent flyer (unless u have a decent 
     reputation already)...especially if it's yur first party
     in the area...i mean how else are kids gonna judge the
     party by if u haven't done a party yet...the better the flyer,
     the more seriously they'll take the party & the promotor
     ...plus usually the flyer more than anything else that
     entices kids to even come out to a party...

2) you've got to put out those flyers...this means hitting all the
    partys going on weeks before the party...and handing 'em out
    individually...leaving stacks by the door just won't cut it...the
    smart way is to get hardcore party kids to do it for you...cuz
    they love doing it especially if it means they can get on the
    guestlist...plus since they know many o the kids out there already, 
    they're more apt to have faith in the party...and don't forget to
    put the flyer kids on the guestlist...don't be dubbed the 'greedy 
    promotor' that charges his own help!  

3) you've got to have a decent voice mail line...one that won't get
     full causing unnecessary stress for ravers who travel from 
     afar only to call yur v-mail only to get a 'sorry voice mail is
     full' message...in addition don't make any crude statements on
     there...be respectful to the ones who will be paying for your
     bills or suffer the consequences...and last, but definitely not
     least...make sure to give highly detailed directions from all
     points: north, south, east, & west...remember many of the kids
     will be coming from out of town, so they will have no clue of
     the name of any of the roads or landmarks, even if they may
     seem trivial to you.

4) utilize this list...or get in contact with someone on this list...
    many, many kids get their info of this list and this list only...
    heck, most of my opinions concerning party plans comes 
    straight from this list...and i inturn will pass on all the 
    information via word o mouth to all my friends...and that is
    actually the #1 way a party is advertised is via word o mouth
    ...friends tellin other friends what to do & makin plans...

Henry on vocals.  Any info. would be helpful.

I'd like a copy of the IGC picture too.  Our video girls had so much fun with the Atomic Babies that they forgot to tape most of the night.  It would be nice to have a picture, at least.

Call Downlow's info. line 412.355.8425 and directions will be posted.

open for the party kids to play with.  this year's will be held on
september 12th and will cost $20 canadian which is about $15 american.
 here's the line-up!

Aiee! I've been waiting a year to hear even a little sample

one that I didn't attend! Makes me want to cry.

A Review of Robert de la Gauthier . . . by Vowels

"A"  As in I'd give pHryL and Technova an "A" for a splendid job.  This
night out proves that it doesn't always have to be a huge affair for it to
be enjoyable event.

"I"  As in "Incredible" choice of dj's.  Go go Gauthier was sometimes
playful, sometimes serious, but always in the moment.  And that made all
the difference.  He played off of the crowd instead of merely running a
pre-programmed set.  It really took me back to a time in the early 90's
when clubbing in C-town always meant a guaranteed good time (ie The Lift,
Metropolis, 9 of Clubs, ect). 

"U"  As in "Uncertain" as to whether or not all that dry fog from the
smoke machine that kept spewing in my face is dangerous for me.  I was
jumping up and down in the front and swallowed a couple dozen mouthfuls of
the stuff.  

"O"  As in "Orgasmic Techno".  I've never seen Richie Hawtin spin live,
but there were moments that made me feel that Robert was the next best
thing.  As far as I'm concerned, this is God's music -- ever climbing,
building, higher higher ah ya higher but not quite cumming techno is the
bomb, baby (okay, cumming a few times along the way is cool). 

"E"  Well, this was apparently the only vowel that was missing on Friday.
Maybe we can have a full set of vowels for the next one!   :)

Braden

P.S. It was great to see Brian, Dave, Viktor, Rob Sherwood, Mike Filly,
Todd, Jamie "Trout Soup", Jade and Casey (with her 2 hottie friends)!

This list makes it all that much more fun to be there!

its a shame that kids will look at a 4-color process flyer and think,
wowwie this'll be a great party.  ask 'em who the djs are and which they
like and get,,,,  uhhh i dunno for the answer.

yeah, i'm surprised how many dont bother.   i usually put my flyers in my
collection a wk or so after i get 'em.  i look at the rom &
mw-raves-calendar to see where i'm going.
(pathetic--i know, that i have to look at the ROM all the time!!!)
but what can you do, its not like i'm gonna chase after promoters to put
them on the rom, after all they're the ones making the $$$, not me, so i
guess its in their best interests.

To those of you that came to see Robert De LaGauthier all of us involved
would just like to say a huge thank you.  Robert also wanted me to thank
you the whole crowd (he tried to do it personally but we ran out of time)
and say that he had a great time.  I am go to tell a little story that
tells that there really is a good raver spirit. 

Robert's records never made it to Cleveland for that show.  We had five
hours to collect records for him to play from all of the kids in Cleveland.
 And in order for him to play his tracks that he wrote (Pussy Shaver, Bump
of K, and Brown Acid {Underworld and Floyd track}), we had to edit a DAT
from Nocturnal Emission and reburn it on CD so they could be played.  He
also remixed all of them for the hell of it.  So i also want to thank all
of the kids that really made that show happen.  

And regarding that comment about his eight hour set, it is true.  he has
also played for ten hours on a beach in Germany in front of 10,000 fans (
Iam sure the vibe was just as phat as it was Friday).  

I have personally not seen a feeling like that in Trilogy for several years
(maybe Metropolis days) it reinstated my beliefs.

I also want to apoligize to the 100 or so kids that were regected at the
door for being under 18.  It was supposed to be an all ages show, but half
way thru the night the cop said we couldn't allow it any more.  So I really
apoligize to you.  

pHryl and us will have future events that you should keep your eye out for:

August 15, 1998 - Phorm!  Not one to be missed.  A room of the best Jungle
in the world, a room of the best techno around, and another room of chill
ambient trance.  We are going to keep the trend of phat parties going do
not worry.

Future club events to look for:
 October - Robert De LaGauthier
 ?October - DJ Hardware

And coming in November -
	TekNova's One Year Anniversary party (We are pulling out all the stops on
this one).

Well I think that's it.
once again thank you: kids, Punisher, Robert De LaGauthier, Rob Sherwood,
Viktor, Ridley, all record donators, and anyone else I missed.

Definetely,
Matthew
TekNova Productions

CD's are not available in the states as far as I know.  But in an agreement
with Robert the DAT's are for personal use only.  But another promoter has
rights to sell his set, once more tapes are made I will submit a post.

I don't mean to be obnoxious or paranoid but its a well known fact that
cops have been reading (and possibly posting) to dcraves for a few years.
Granted, DC/Baltimore coppers are probably a little more high tech than
pb-cle cops, but I imagine that if they don't know about the list know,
they will subscribe on sooner or later.  Making the archives more obscure
will not make much of a difference.  I'm not saying people should change
the content of their messages; just be aware of it and maybe think a
second before you go to post.

This list seemed like the best place to post this query...

I'd like to get some records or CDs that include cool samples for use
while DJing.  Spoken word, (like vocal snippets, movie samples, etc.) are
what I'm after more than "sound effects."  Given my style, really ominous
spooky weird-ass stuff is preferred.  Although bits of news reports,
sermons, etc can be cool when taken out of context...

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Well known by whom?  I didn't know.  Has it been documented?  Just a
thought.

I was thinking about this a few days ago.  There are so many things that
go on in this world that are illegal that people talk about on mailing
lists and chat rooms.  Why aren't there more cops cracking down?  I don't
really think they know about this list or any others.  I think things
would have happened by now.  (I don't think there's anyway to test this
theory, although it would be an interesting experiment.)  Just a thought.
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd like some cold hard facts to
back up your bash, if you please.

hey brian, this is ryu...how the hell are ya!

the best place i've found to find these sort of things on vinyl is your local
thrift store.  i suggest the one in avalon.  it's my fav.
i usually buy the story book + record combos, throw away the books,
and use the records for cool samples.  the beeping sound placed on
these records that is to indicate for you to turn the page sounds really
nice when scratched with.  and there are always lots of neat little frases
in tehre that can be used.  the cheesey kiddie stuff always sounds
sick and demented when mixed in with dark music.  look for halloween
related records.  halloween sfx records (and cds of course).

i know there are tons vinyl and cd recordings of spoken word stuff
to be found in the pitt area.  i always see malcom x recordings,
mlk jr stuff, and there is lots of catholic "masses on a record" that
you can sort thru for good ideas.

good luck,
ryu

tedius job in which irc numbs the pain, and i have  met a lot of cool
kidz.  I don't hermit myself away in a comp. lab to do this, and i have a
life.  I just happen to have to work from 5-11 m-th nights.  

I'm so sorry i don't live up to your industry standard of cool nor do i
ever intend to.  You seem to have enough time to write email...you use a
computer...why not extend that further.  God, the ignorance and stupidity
of some people...no wonder this scene has taken so long to get back on its
feet.

     get a laserdisc player. movies are full of cool
     samples. laserdiscs have a cd-quality soundtrack,
     and cueing is easy. or a DVD player, but the 
     selection of movies is a little limited.

Greetings from CA>>
This is going across many regional mailing lists, so my apologies if
you receive this more than once.

I am offering up some records for sale or trade. The URL is:
http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Cabaret/4022
Between myself and two friends, there are ~450 records there,
including some rare white labels, promos, and test pressings. There is
a Wanted List posted as well. 

I urge you to check it out soon. Several For Sales have already been
traded or sold, and there has been a great response on the Wanted List
as well (I will try and keep things updated). This is a great
opportunity for someone looking to unload old records they no longer
play, or maybe pick up some stuff they missed first time around.
Musical genres represented here are mostly all techno, trance, or
house, with a small amount of breaks and maybe some ambient.

If you don't have Web access but are still interested in viewing the
lists, please email me privately and I'll get them to you as soon as I
can.....

Please forward this message to anyone you think might be interested! 


Peace, 
Dave Q

I agree..  Toronto is a very interesting place.  Once you've gone to a party
in Toronto, it makes the parties here seem pretty weak.  Take, for example,
the Ritual 4 party in Toronto last Saturday.  Autechre performed live, along
with Richie Hawtin doing a 4 turntable/909/effects processor set, a live
tribal percussion outfit (i can't remember the name off-hand) and also Theorum
live, Lotus, Algorithm as well as several other toronto locals.  I was
actually quite suprised to see 2 carloads of people from Ohio up at this
event.  About 1300 people in all attended this event in an Opera House.  That
may not seem like that many people, but there were 2 other parties in Toronto
on saturday, one of which had 3000 people.  On Sunday in Toronto, pHryL teamed
up with David Nunez (Atom Musica) to put on a little event showcasing some of
america's finest underrated acts - (hyperactive, drivetrain, eddie fowlkes
[who sucked =)], along with england's pure science (performing live).  despite
toronto's huge techno crowd, only about 400 people showed up (there was a
party at industry with sneak and derrick carter which had almost 2000).  

i just thought i would let people know about some of the amazing stuff
happening in toronto that so very few people here even hear about.

so, on a lark, i decided to go to columbus for the weekend...

after meeting up with amy/funkybizz, stevie and their friend george...we
went to red zone, saw the crowd that was waiting in line to get in, and
decided to head to the (other/after)party, held at the armory.


what a nice space, i agree :) 

big old rave room...smooth concrete floors, high ceilings,
bathrooms...perfect.

don from wizard workshop had his system rockin as usual. this guy's sound
is always superb, major props...

randy/electrolyte fx was running things visually, another wicked
lightshow...these two guys are getting a really good rep around here.

there was a little courtyard in the back, there was a tent, a pair of 12's,
some speakers...it was the nicest second/chill room i've been to in a long
time.

i always feel a bit depressed when i walk into a room that's all ready to
go but there's no one there.

all the ingredients are there, it's just missing the one (most important)
thing a party needs...people.

that is where the promotion would have helped...it's sad that people didn't
show, i think the organizers did a great job, but a lot of people didn't
have clear info on the party.

that aside, we arrived around 1-ish i think; saw ed and charles chillin
outside of the party..i told them how stupid i thought ele_mental was and
walked inside. 

the little room was better (for me) than the big room most of the
nite...there was a lot of *nice* breaks and house being dropped, i had so
much fun dancing out there :)

inside it was alot harder house, more straight beat stuff...amy liked it
more than i did, like i told her...i started off dancing to breaks and
jungle...i need it to keep changing up, my feet just sit there to most hard
shit (incl. most two-step dnb).

as the night went on, i stopped caring that there was no one there, and
started to have a lot of fun...dancing outside in that courtyard was so
nice, the stars were out, it was warm, there was good places to
dance...things were very nice :)

towards 5am the main room started to get pretty good...lots of big *rave*
music going on, it was nice to hear it on a good loud system...

people seemed to be getting into it, it was weird for a minute to see ppl
raving so hard in an pretty empty building, but they get props...and then
the lights came back on around 6, that was really nice...the party was
supposed to end @ 6am, but it was still going on when we left @ 6:40.

it was a beautiful weekend, all cracked out, drinkin 40's in the early
morning, ghetto style yo...


we saw fear + loathing on saturday...this would be really nice to see high,
i can't imagine how freaky it would be on acid...but sober it still fucks
you up...:)

sat. we just vegged...stevie said we picked the wrong nite to go out, that
we shoulda went to rapture instead...and altho it may have had a better
lineup, i think i still had more fun on friday nite.

big thanks to stevie for the crash space and making me crack up sat.
afternoon...i've never seen you that funny...:) amy (or funky like stevie
says) thanks for convincing me to come up :)

i just have to add that hello nasty sounds so much deeper when you smoke,
it's like a completely different album...you hear so much more...i know i
sound like a stoner but it's true. :)

oh and i heard that money mark and kid koala are the opening act for the
beastie boys...yay :)

yeah that will be a dope weekend :)

oh yeah, columbus ;) it really was a fun town this weekend, i'm glad i
went. :)

peace,
hossam

This would be the latest Roule record entitled "The music Sounds Better with
you" by Stardust which is Thomas Bangalther(one half of DAFT PUNK), Alan
Queme, and Benjemin Cohen.  Great track! This was the track that Roy Davis Jr.
opened with at Family Affair, and pretty much started the party that saturday
night.  you shouuld be able to find it anywhere as it is a very popular record
right now.

Peace,
Jason

When you're in Cleveland, check out the store Records on the west side. 
(It used to be around Madison & 70th, but it moved down the road to a
bigger warehouse...call 411 for their new address.)  They have
stacks&stacks&stacks of records everywhere.  So many that you can't even
get to half of them because there are stacks in the way.  I've gotten at
least 50 records there over the past year & have spent maybe $30.  Things
like War of the Worlds, Alice in Wonderland, haunted house records, Indian
music, and a belly dancing instructional record.  (It's actually the one
where Dee-lite got that "Let's dance and have a good time" sample at the
beginning of Groove Is in the Heart.  Imagine my surprise.)  Truly an
amazing store.

Leave some records for me.

Toronto does have amazing parties...even restored my faith in them, I must
say.  Though big ones like Citrus are great fun (especially if you've never
been to a party with more than a couple thousand people), some of the
smaller ones can be even better.  pHryl's Progress was literally the best
party I've been to in years vibewise.  Even the crappier Toronto parties
can be fun if you've never been to one just because they're a different
environment.  And Canadian $20 is down to almost US$13 now...Hmmm, just
about time to pump some money into that Ontario economy.

Oh yeah, dress in the fattest pants you have, and you'll meet 100 people
wondering where you bought them.

Remember how excited I was about DIESELBOY.  Well it turns out that the 
first rave I ever went to he was there.  I forgot that so I haven't seen 
him for like 2 years(since I was a new comer).  

Well, I made the stupidest mistake today at the record store.  Because I 
am such a music fanatic--I am really CRAZY!!!    I went there looking 
for some Dieselboy, forgetting that his name is one.  WEll, there is 
another performer out there called Diesel boy(surf rock) that I bought.  
It really sucked hard-core.  I like alot of musics but this really 
sucked.  Well, I can't wait to take it back.  Just had to share my 
stupidness.

Hey there Moseley here.  Well I know some of you may hate this song, but I
like it and want it..bad! It starts off with an aerobics instructor say'n:
"stand with your buttocks tight, arm straight out shoulder width apart...and
back 2345678 and back!  Then a beat kicks in, at that point i start dance'n
like a fah-REAK.  If anyone could help me find this record I'll give you my
little brother.  He doesn't eat much and loves to clean.

Luv peace and stuff that makes ya feel fuzzy.

Eric Justin (X-on) lives in Philadelphia now and spins hip-hop.  and, 
from what i've heard, he's quite good at it.

Scott Weinstock (Finger) lives in Swissvale and works at Coffee Tree 
Roasters in Squirrel Hill.  I see him often and have been begging him to 
spin again for years, but he doesn't really want to.  He does still buy 
records "from time to time".

I was coloring with him and hossam last night.  that was keen.

the one the only poppa buda

finger (although he doesn't have that many records anymore)

eric justin

jedi mindtrip (heheh good luck tracking him down, and if you did manage, 
good luck still *wink ;)*

terry kicks (still around-- i saw him at cafe au lait a month ago and i 
wonder if he remembered me)

digital jesus and his old records

+FX (holy sheepdip geoff i don't know if you have heard of him or his 
styles but let's just say in 1992 he rocked the german hardcore and 
napalm death-esque rock like a surgeon)

Side2 (one of the ward street basement mashup legends and an all around 
nice guy)

--

If I saw a party with only these djs throwing down, i'd cry.  
tears of 16 year old bliss and joy, that is.

hannibal
the dames call him 'colby'

hehehe :)
there's a very funny story about grooverider and pittsburgh, actually.

when finger and i were promoting for "daze", this party that we threw in 
94 in schenley park, we had one of those 734 extension infolines.  the 
lineup was buda, x-on, dieselboy, and groovemasta.  i don't know if any 
of you remember groovemasta, but he was one of those kids that had a 
low-riding el camino with bass cabinets and besides his general 
shadiness he played the same old bad breaks that were even considered 
lame by newcomers to the scene back then.  

i love long sentences.

OH, I'm being so unnecessarily harsh.  :)  I can't remember exactly why 
he spun at the party, but that's beyond the point.  Enough of this 
segway.

Anyhoo, Scott recorded the infoline greeting, and accidentally said 
"Grooverider" instead of "Groovemasta".  Later that afternoon when the 
line's message capacity was completely maxxed out with "Fucking shit!  
Grooverider!?!  I can't believe Pittsburgh is actually getting REAL DJs" 
messages and the ilk, we realized we made a slight mistake.  It was a 
free party, and a good time was had by all who showed up, Groovrider or 
no Grooverider.  :) 

ps: that would have been keen, and if the food group happened to have 
had enough money back then, mark my words, we would have brought the 
mighty rider to pittsburgh.  yup.  rider would have said, "wicked, mate, 
you kids really know how to mash it down in pittsburgh."  perhaps he 
would have become a yinzer at heart and release an album on prototype 
called "giaahnt iggl"-- a rinsin' selection with ramming amens and rough 
basslines that makes the crowd go "oooH" in amazement.

and scott and i would get free dubplates.  and we'd be living in bristol 
by now.

MAN

i could have been a catalyst.

Well, thank you very much for your honest opinion. That's what I wanted. I
agree with you SO much about EVERYTHING you said. 

#1- The party was so unorganized. I know, and knew then that organization is
the key, and me and my partner both thought we were organized enough. We
learned the hard way we were wrong, very wrong.  This was my first MAJOR
event, and I learned ALOT of valuable lessons!  I know that I must get
WWWAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY more organized!  And I will.  We had the original lineup
made up a few days before the party.  I think you and most others would've
approved of it much more than the way it all turned out.  But that lineup died
by the second DJ.  We didn't have enough DJ accomidators, to drive the DJs to
the hotel, airport, and party.  The DJ's that were driving, most wern't told
when they were spinning, (Big mistake!), and arrived way late. So the lnew
line-up was based on "Who's here now?"  And the Atomic Babies missed they're
plane, left a voicemail asking us to call them and let them know what we
wanted them to do, which we didn't get untill the morning, instead of getting
on the NEXT plane like your supposed to do if you miss your plane.  

#2 - Perry Ellis, I personally didn't want him at my party. I talked with him
MONTHS ago, and agreed to let him spin.  Then I threw Borderline, he spun
there, and I didn't like dealing with him at all. He's a big whiney baby! :>
I told myself he will never spin at another one of my party's again.  Well, I
was blowing him off at booking time, so he called my partner, and he booked
him. Sent him his deposit and all, without talking to me first. So, there it
was, he was going to be at Sprout'in.  THEN, his contract was SUCH BULLSHIT!
It stated that he must be no more than the 4th DJ from the top on the flyer,
(Which is typical for headliner DJ's, but not Perry Ellis.), And he must spin
out between 1am and 3am, which is why the cocksucker got that time slot, and
there was even a little clause at the bottem both me and my partner missed
till the night of the party that stated we were responsible for his gas too,
after we already payed him $300 for his performance. (Way too much!)  AND, I
couldn't believe the set he layed down, it SUCKED so bad!!!! It had to've been
his WORST set I ever heard!!!  I can honestly say Perry Ellis will never be at
another E Productions event again!   I'm very sorry everyone had to put up
with that noise at the peak of the night!

#3 - It's All About the Music is offically POSTPONED!  I hate to do it, but we
lost too much money on Sprout'in to throw it right now.  I guess the main
reason for lack of kidz was the voice mailbox's being full for like 3 hours
the first time and 2 hours the 2nd.  Learned lots of lessons learned I tell
ya!   But I will still be throwing that party, it won't be till like Dec, Jan,
or Feb..... but it WILL be thrown, with the same lineup, (With a couple of
changes and additions!),  and it will be WAY more organized!!   And I'll be
doing the party by myself so I know everything will be done right.  In between
then, I plan on throwning a couple more afterparties, and maybe a pre-party,
and maybe a house party or two.  

I'm try'in to organize an official E-productions crew.  It will be a crew,
dedicated to helping me throw some bomb ass parties all around the Ohio area.
If you or anyone you know is interested, please let me know.  And let it be
known, that anyone in this crew won't be able to party and dance during the
party, they will have important jobs to do. (I'm sure there will be time fer
SOME dance'in! hehehe)   The job will have it's benifits. ;-> 

Welp, hit me back. And thank you for your support!

                              -e-

As Matt pointed out, Robert really enjoyed Friday night at Trilogy. I was
with him till Sunday afternoon, and he wanted me to thank everyone again for
the great time he had. He apologized that he couldn't play longer than 3:30,
but the club owner set that as the latest time for the show to end. 

Also the Detroit's and probably America's premiere female techno producer/DJ
Punisher who was our special guest prior to Robert's set would also like to
thank you for the nice time she had there. She will be back in Cleveland in
2 weeks again for Phorm, but more on that little later.

On Saturday Robert played at a large party in Detroit. Despite the 4:30-6:30
time slot, most of the people were still there waiting for his set. With has
records having arrived in Cleveland the night before, he created a frenzy
atmosphere there by dancing and jumping all over the stage, throwing water
bottles in the crowd and posing for pictures while playing his favourite
tracks. Everyone there had fun as well.

Tapes of Robert de la Gauthier were available on Friday (I had several
copies of his Techno and Speed Garage tapes). There will be tapes also
available at PHORM, along side with tapes of Adam Beyer, Cari Lekbusch and
Christian Smith. Just ask one of pHryL. people there (we usually carry
around orange stickers), and you will be able to find them.

Also, I would like to thank to the Columbus and the Pittsburgh people who
made it to our event in Toronto FUTURE LEGENDS on Sunday night. The 400
person crowd was well entertained with techno all night, but knowing that
some people from this area made the trip, made the night even more special. 

Ciao,
Viktor

PHORM:

On August 15 pHryL. teams up with Teknova again to bring you PHORM in
Cleveland. This is most likely the last pHryL. affiliated show ever in the
US. We will continue and solely concentrate to events in Toronto - next one
is November 28. 

For our last State side show we have gone out of our way to bring you more
variety that we have ever offered before (PHORM will actually be close on
that to our Toronto's FORWARD party). We are bringing the Jungle Pioneer SHY
FX who is credited as the person who not only co-invented jungle in the late
80's with the likes of Fabio and The Guy called Gerald, but also brought it
to another level with his mega hit - ORIGINAL NUTTAH for which UK Apache
donated his lyrics. The whole Formation Records crew - one of the original
breakbeat posses that's been in business for over 9 years, will be fully
represented there as well. SS and JOHN B are one of the most admired and
respected d'n'b producers and DJ's and they choose this opportunity to
showcase their new upcoming albums and to honor the recently finished WORLD
CUP (despite the fact that England didn't do too well). MC Warren G will be
providing the lyrics and the flow for the night. This tour has only 5 North
American stops, and none in the mid-west except for Cleveland. Just the
exclusivity to have these guys here makes it more worth for you to show your
respect to them. 
 
To round up the d'n'b talent, we have also invited are favourite American DJ
- Dieselboy. With his new releases on 611 and UK's Technical Itch, he's
getting even more recognized in this country, and slowly making his way
abroad.

On the Techno front, once again we are bringing one of Sweden's finest -
Christian Smith. Being a pHryL. veteran with 4 of our events under his belt,
he's sure to take you by STORM, just as his "Tribal STORM" track has topped
the techno charts worldwide for the last couple of months. He teams up with
BARADA, known for his excellent productions on +8, Definitive and Tronic
Music to offer 2 special TRONIC MUSIC tag team sets - house and techno. 
Detroit's PUNISHER is using this opportunity to showcase the release of her
new label. Despite the fact that she's only 19 she has already worked with
the likes of Richie Hawtin, Vapourspace, Christian Smith etc. Being a DJ and
producer for the last 4 years she's getting the utmost respect of the
Detroit techno elite, and has had numerous offers for production work from
US and European artists. She will be delivering a blend of European soothing
techno with a Detroit touch. 

The rest of the line up mostly consists of artists and DJ's that you should
be familiar with. 
Rob Morley, the UP-State NY pioneer has been on the hard acid trance and goa
forefront for the last 8 years. 
The Point Alpha kids and Pure were the revelations at Sub Phunc 27, and they
are back by popular demand with their minimal deep techno, and harder edge
tech-trance respectively. 
Locutus is the representative of the new wave of techno DJ's and has been
playing consistently in Detroit after his move from Indy. 
7-up has become a crowd favourite in the area with his house/speed garage
blend.
Circuitry, the main man behind Shortarm, will be bringing the tech-trance
sound. He's been getting lots of recognition lately, which has topped with
an invitation to play along side Chris Liberator at a Detroit event this
fall.
DJ^2 will close the second room with his mellow d'n'b.
Lastly, there is Sleepy C. The veteran of the Cleveland and the Ohio scene
in general. He's been DJ's and organizing events longer that most of us have
known about music, let alone house and techno.  


The time-slots for the event are as follows:

Room 1 (predominantly jungle, with house in the beginning and end):

10-12	Sleepy C
12-1:30	Dieselboy
1:30-3	Shy FX    -  Warren G will be MC-ing the 1:30-6 time frame
3-4:30	SS
4:30-6	John B
6-8	Barada and Christian Smith (house tag team)

Room 2 (predominantly techno, with speed garage and mellow d'n'b at the
end):

10:30-11:30	Free Bass
11:30-1		Locutus
1-2:30		Punisher (she is still deciding whether this will be a DJ or
a LIVE set)
2:30-4:30	Christian Smith and Barada (techno tag team)
4:30-6:30	7-up
6:30-8		DJ^2

Room 3 (techno/trance/goa and some ambient) 

12-2	Rob Morley
2-3	Pure (aka T.R. Generation) - LIVE
3-4:30	Circuitry - LIVE
4:30-6	Punisher (techno DJ set)	  
6-8	Point Alpha - LIVE

The show will be all ages. The location will be announced on this list as
well as the info-lines the day before the show.

We have tried to keep the price for this event as low as possible. With the
doors opening at 9:45 and the posted time slots we encourage everyone to
make their way there early. Advance tickets will not be sold (despite what
the flyer states) since there will be enough tickets and space inside for
everyone - the venue capacity exceeds 2000. The door price will be $20
before midnight, and slightly higher after that.  

Please e-mail us with any questions, concerns, suggestions.

Hope to see you all there.

haha, we know tom c is secretly a progressive house fan (maybe even djs 
it?) and has candy & a lolly stashed somewhere.
<snicker> my friend recently had a bout w/ the "lolly madness". he got 
all candy & had it on a necklace, but then at the caffine tour it broke. 
clearly fate had not intended for him to have a pacifier. (also I had 
the constant urge to slap it out his face, but that's another matter) 
friends don't let friends suck on a lolly.

Ok.  A legitimate question.  We can play that game.  Go to
www.ultrworld.net.  Click on the link that says "Fight the Power". 
Proceed to read the long story about a great promoter from Baltimore who
was severely harassed by cops.  Note the times the cops shook printouts at
him and said something to the effect of "we know what you kids are up to.
we read your mailing lists on the internet."  It is a bit vague.  They
could be talking about alt.raves (hah!) but it seems to me that they know
what's up.  Most people on DCraves will say without much doubt that cops,
narcs, feds, spooks, etc. read the list.  Maryland State Police have (or
used to) a raves task force.  If they have not found the mailing lists on
hyperreal by now, they are in bad shape.  I think its a bit naive and
disrespectful to think that most cops are so dumb or computer illiterate
that they would not do a simple search on the net and come up with
hyperreal.

Indeed, but first of all talk is not illegal.  As long as you are not
making threats or conspiring to do something you can talk all you want
(unless the patriotic wackos have their way and flag burning becomes
illegal).  The second issues is that the internet is such a free for all
that its almost impossible to authenticate anything.  Forging email is
trivially easy.  There is no way to verify that the person who posted a
message is the person that they claim to be.  Also there is no reason to
believe that what a person is saying is true.  So all the police can use
the internet for is to get leads on possible cases.  If they subscribe to
a bunch of mailing lists they know when the parties are, they know who is
talking about buying and selling lots of drugs, they know who the shady
promoters are.  They can just sit passively and delete lots of stupid
posts talking about pants size and save the ones talking about drugs. They
are not going to bust anyone for saying "I dropped two tabs, took 3 Rolls
Royces, and bumped 6 lines of crystal last weekend" becuase they have no
real evidence.  But if you say "I bought 5 kilos of coke from this guy,
anyone want to buy some blow"  you might find some people following you
around.  You are not going to see posts from SgtShmengie@copshop.gov.
Also, if you were going under cover and wanted to have all the info on
"the scene", what are the best places to get it?  The list would be one of
my first suggestions.
  I'm not telling people how they should behave.  This list is not
"underground".  Any moron with internet service can subscribe.  I just
want people to know this and not be so naive as to think "only cool elite
raver scenster kids are on this list".  Post what you want, just be aware.

Appologies if I sounded condescending at all.  That was not my intention.

I didn't mean to single this individual's post out as a singualarly-offensive
one, but posts like this have been becoming increasingly bothersome to me. I
thought this scene was supposed to be about acceptance of differences, and
allowing people to express themselves as they choose in the face of great
music. Perhaps I was wrong, because when I see people within the scene dissing
their fellow party kids for their selection of music-type and appearance, I
really begin to wonder. What's with all this "I'm more old-school than you"
and "if you're candy, you're not cool" stuff? If you ask me, it's complete
bullshit. These are the kind of sentiments that are going to make this scene
self-destruct...there are enough people out there opposed to raving that those
of us within the scene must conest with, so why start rivalries amongst
ourselves?

As far as I am concerned, to hell with all this music-politic garbage. If you
like house, you can still be down...break beats, techno, hardstep. jungle,
darkstep-I'll take you too. Candy-ravers, tweakin' meth kids, you name it,
I'll take them. Whether you're at the party to spin, to promote, to dance, or
just to check it out, so long as you are there for the music..no matter *what*
music you prefer.. you are down. 

I didn't mean to go off on a mad-crazy tangent, but this has been bothering me
for a bit. As for the girl who's post I just happened to single out, I hope
you are't upset about this, like I said...I didn't mean to imply that your
post was the only negative one out there, it just happened to be this morning
that things set me off ;) No insult intended. Friends don't let friends diss
fellow party kids.

I think you misunderstood my post.  I was only trying to inform people
that police probably are aware of the list and probably read it.  I was
not trying to suggest that people should censor themselves or should
modify the wording or content of their messages. I think (most) people on
this list are intelligent enough to make decisions for themselves.

fyi, i forgot the requisite winky " ;) "

actually i told ed i loved his hair and i think he's the best dancer i've
ever seen. and charles gave me mc'ing advice.


WINKY.


which sounds like binky, which is what everyone i know calls pacifiers, its
so stupid.

ok, ??...why do ppl wear face masks when they aren't even rolling? when did
that become a fashion accessory? i think that is the stupidest thing i've
ever seen.

i never used a binkie. my biggest problem with masks (they were so fucking
cool) was that i couldnt wear a mask and blow my whistle at the same time.
i wish someone would fix that. not that i'd use a mask anymore (unless
really pumped to the gills on goofballs), i just want someone to make it
easier for future generatons of fuct up party kids to get their kicks.


toot tooooot,
hossam

>I didn't mean to single this individual's post out as a

increasingly bothersome to me. I thought this scene was supposed to be 
about acceptance of differences, and allowing people to express 
themselves as they choose in the face of great music. 

Right-on, Housekitten! Exactly what I was thinking. 

Unless these kind of jabs are tongue-in-cheek, they usually put me in a 
bad mood too.

that's the way it works.. it always does..  anytime any scene starts to
head toward the mainstream, people feel it necessary to prove how cool
they are by telling you how long they've been into the scene..  "hey
man, i'm more punk than you...  i've been listening to punk music since
the 1978...  check out how cool my mowhawk is!"  ok.. you win...  here's
your gold star for the day.  "i've been raving since 1989... look how
big my pants are!"  ok... we have another winner..  what does it matter?
housekitten is right, as long as you're down with what matters, what
does it matter WHEN you got into it..  what matters is WHY you got into
it.

just my 2 cents..
 
Peace, Love, UNITY, Respect.

This would be the latest Roule record entitled "The music Sounds Better
with
you" by Stardust which is Thomas Bangalther(one half of DAFT PUNK), Alan
Queme, and Benjemin Cohen.  Great track! This was the track that Roy
Davis Jr.
opened with at Family Affair, and pretty much started the party that
saturday
night.  you shouuld be able to find it anywhere as it is a very popular
record
right now.

Peace,
Jason

HOW   SEXY   ARE   YO   SOUNDS? 

"How Sexy Are Your Sounds" article by Sara Finlayson 

Music Style--HOUSE

Music Style--JUNGLE/D&B 
Audience: Fed-up ex-ravers and hyperactive Hip-Hop heads. Relatively
young, more popular with girls than most
forms of electronic music. 
Attire: Hip-Hop meets rave goes for a skate and then joins the Army. 
Motions: Flipper-like motions of the hands with a few moves collected
from watching Beat Street. Circle dancer
meets MC Hammer. 
Sex Status: Jungle, like other forms of bass-heavy music, is very sexy. 
Get Laid?: 6 outta 10

popular with serial killers. 
Attire: Multiple piercings, wife-beater shirts, baggy trousers, and
short hair. 
Motions: Vigorous jumping up and down, pogo'ing, and speaker fucking. 
Sex Staus: Stuck midway through adolescent masturbatory phase. Anxious
and feverish dance style suggests an
urgent need to get laid. 
Get Laid?: 0 outta 10 (only a mother could love these guys) 
                                                                                     
Music Style--GOA/PSYCH TRANCE 
Audience: Crusties and anti-establishment trust fund babies 
Attire: Matted dreadlocks, tie dye, and sandals remain popular. A faint
whiff of Nag Champa is usually evident. 
Motions: Hippie dance style reminiscent of '60s exploitation movies.
Crazy arms motions and rubbery legs usually
point to excessive LSD intake. 
Sex Status: Attractive to each other. Hose down before use. 
Get Laid?: Depends on the phase of the Moon. 
                                                                                     
Music Style--PROGRESSIVE HOUSE/TRANCE 
Audience: University students and candy ravers. 
Attire: 'E' friendly apparel, including fluffy backpacks, glitter,
pacifiers, and anything resembling a Dr.Suess
character. 
Motions: Hands in the air. Eyes rolling back. Occasionally slumped
against the wall. 
Sex Status: No thanks...we're in it for the music. Hugs welcome. 
Get Laid?: Males: 2 outta 10 (too busy trainspotting), Females: 6 outta
10 (they look great...to dirty old men)

Andy the suge

SUPERSTRUCTURE: Maybe they're angry because they're grown in
meccano-breeders.

well, as long as you didn't get into it to hear a lot of good music,
dance with a lot of cool people and have a good time in a fun and
mutually respectful atmosphere while maybe enjoying some good drugs at
the same time, then that's a good enough reason..  right?

Bleah,

I finally got my computer hooked back up in my new pad, and I was 600
messages behind... rather than read all of it I deleted them all, so if
anyone said anything of importance to me on the list, please re-mail as
E-mail :)

Dan K

p.s. It's good to be back on:)

meccano is a song by sun electric, melodic whippy quasihard trance

long live electronic music...i will never get bored with it.

i looked up meccano in the dictionary and i found it was a derivative of
machine.

i was bored and i had to create a signature like none other.  so i
decided to rifle through the THX1138 script that i had on my computer
for a radical quote.  'SUPERSTRUCTURE' derives from some direction
directive. the rest of the sig is a direct quote.  i have a confession,
i am ignorant myself.  i haven't even seen THX in its wholeness.  i
can't seem to find it.  if anyone has it...whyont you get it to me.  i
know it is about: sedatives, the government, stimulants, biology,
bizarre minimal repetitive environments.  i think the meccano comes from
the way the dystopia is created/produced ( a la BRAVE NEW WORLD).

rob de la rocks my ass.  i missed him at trilogy because i failed to
produce resources.  but, from what i hear from the people...the taikno
part of his set is similar to the tape i have and the set from BIZ so i
feel like i didnt miss anything.  and it is "born slippy, nuxx.dark and

     duh. and i didn't even recognize it. i consider 
     thx1138 one of the most important films ever created.
     i can get you the laserdisc, i guess. i don't have
     it on tape. you should be able to find it at your
     local blockbuster, in any case. um, yeah. robert 
     duvall with a shaven head. totally cool.

     i think the quote is from the 'theater of noise', a
     TV show where people speak utter and complete nonsense.
     but people watch it with absorbed intensity just like
     any other show.

     the film makes interesting statements about racism, and
     also about repression. actually, very appropriate to
     the rave crowd, now that i think of it...

     drugs to keep people in control. stupid silver mechanical
     cops, inefficient and benign. amazing film.

     try emailing thx1138@bayes.sis.pitt.edu - that's me.
     well, i AM a geek.

     later,
     geekboy aka thx1138

     and no, i have never shaved my head.

    drive up the list traffic, why don't cha. my god...
    and i feel bad about posting long _reviews_.

    your adolescent random pseudo-anger _is_ rather 
    amusing, though. hardly sexy, on the other hand.
    to be really appealing you must be wordy yet 
    concise.

    :P

    and avoid those excessive punctuation marks. while
    amusing, they indicate a limited range of expression,
    or a sticky keyboard.

    and we _wouldn't_ want to speculate on the latter, 
    now, would we?

First of all, I would like to announce that I just purchased Grand Poo-bas
Record Shoppe in Lakewood.   For any of you who have been there in the past,
I want you to know that things will be run a bit differently.  Towards the
end, the previous owner was concentrating mainly on hi-nrg, pop, etc.   I
will (as slow as the process is with limited funds) be concentrating on
stocking a more diverse selection, as well as maintaining what he did
previous.   I know many of you have had problems with special orders, but
that has changed.  Not everything is always available... but I have revamped
his system and am making a valiant effort in trying to find stuff.

Of course there is a website up, but it is under construction and won't be
ready for awhile... but if you want the url check out http://www.poo-bas.com
.  My friends are designing it for me, as I don't really have the time.
Regardless of when it is finished, I will be adding a new release section
where I post what I have on order for the week.

There is a sale about to happen, but I won't be announcing it or anything
like that for at least a week.   If you come in and say your from the list,
I'll give you the sale price, and show you which stacks of records it
includes.
Used:  Buy one at $2.99, the next one at $1.99, and you can buy up to 10 for
$.50 a piece.  Lots of old commercial, disco, techno -- some hard to find
stuff.
Old Backstock:  But one at marked price, get %50 off 4 more, get %75 off up
to 10 more.   Lots of imports and underground stuff that I really want to
get rid of, to make more space for new. '94-'97.


If your looking for new stuff... watts music has a searchable database at
http://www.wattsmusic.com I'll be glad to order from that for you, with a
deposit.  Let me know the artist, and their id #.  There is a section for
normal users -- so don't be alarmed if they ask for a password... look a bit
more and you'll find it.  I don't currently ask for a deposit on special
orders... but if it is more than 3-4 pieces then I would like one.  I
usually have stuff within a week... sometimes less.


Now... for some song id's.

The stardust - music sounds better with you is an import.   Domestic should
be in a month.  CD or vinyl.   There is also a domestic bootleg with more
punch and less vocals.

The record with jane fonda workout samples is from the Bob Sinclair album.
I'll have 2 of them on thursday or friday, but it is a fairly pricey album.

There is also a stardust medly... which has the jane fonda samples over the
music sounds better with you.  I'll have that on thursday or friday.  I
haven't heard it yet... so I hope its not disappointing.


I am also interested in selling mix tapes and mix cd's on consignment... so
if you are into that thing let me know.  Flyers are also welcome.  I'll
gladly do ticket sales, too.

Thanks,
doug

True, I was totally out of it when I wrote my post.  Yah, I always 
understood it to be that way.  Everytime I email my warning device comes 
up and says a third party might read this.  WEll, on this little list 
its even more obvious.  I was just stating that I don't care too much if 
anyone reads my stuff.  I guess I don't say too much stuff thats that 
bad anyhow.  At first I did care because of my dad but now I realize 
that he probably knows enough about my life not to snoop around.  Anyway 
I am 19, I am responsible for myself. 

Thats all I have to say about this matter

I agree in some respects.  Me and my friend bought some of the face
masks with two screw in filters to spraypaint with and we brought them
to IGC because we thought it would be fun, but found out that although
it does clean the air alot and get rid of that smoke (both cigarette
and fog) you just don't get enough air.  The whistle thing sucks too.

On the other hand though if you've ever tried dancing with a paintball
mask on that is a completely different sitaution!  It's fun as hell,
you can blow your whistle, and it doesn't inhibit your breathing.

In answer to your question of why ppl wear them when they aren't
rolling, I think it is just because it is kind of fun and not
something you do every day.

Yeah, that me a jungle junkie, hardcore.  I've been like that since that 
day.  I am addicted and my friends don't understand. For example, I 
turned on Radio Carson today and what did I hear jungle after work.  I 
almost got an orgasm.  I started driving like a maniac or  sometimes the 
opposite occurs I drive slow and savor the moment.  Man, I need help!!

2 other tracks he spun worth mentioning are THE DON "The horn Track" on
strictly Rhythm, and His Own ROY DAVIS JR. PRESENTS "Rock Shock" on Roule. He
spun both his own mix and teh Thomas Bangalther(again, one half of Daft Punk)
mix.  After that i don't remember much of the tracks.  Oh yeah, he also played
"The word is Love" by Steve "silk" Hurley.  Quite an amazing set if you ask
me...

Fiona is one year old and has a rare blood disease.  She's recently
undergone a tracheotomy that has left her cry inaudible.  Pretty sad
situation.  The money raised at Sense (the DJs are spinning for free-the
only real expense has been the space and promotions) will go to her
parents to ease their burden in caring for her.
There will be info. sheets on Fiona at the party.  They have been
circulating for the last couple of months as well.
I commend Dierdre on her tireless efforts in organizing this event.  Not
only is it refreshing to see this new concept of mixing art and music,
it's also priceless to have honest, organized promoters planning smaller
events to keep things moving along during dry spells (and Pittsburgh is
definitely in the midst of one).
I hope everyone makes it out to this event, obviously for more than one
reason.

Hey kids, what's the lowdown on the party this weekend in Cleveland?
Crystalized II I believe...anyone going? If my little baby Max is officially
going to be there, I just might have to head up seeing as how it will be his
last party in the area before heading off to NYC for school. <<get back to me
on that Max>>  Likewise, is anyone planning on coming down to Cincy this
weekend? I don't know if any of you are big graffiti art fans, but the
Scribble Jam is here this whole weekend, and I think it's *free* (always a
major plus). Just wondering if I am going to be seeing any of your shining
faces there....

oh, one last thing...I ask again, anyone coming down this Thursday for
Aphrodite at Elevations? And Jason, I will try and remember to talk to Bob
about you spinning too :)

Hey kids, just to warn you..I dunno *for sure* if this Scribble Jam thingee is
free or not. I have heard it is, but the flyer says nothing about cost either
way (free or not free, that is the question). Just a warning. I imagine the
info line would say something.

much luv

Here's the list of people going to Crystallized 2 on Sat. Aug  8. in Cleveland
as of 8/4/98:

Matt (ratfink@en.com)
Jon (HeflinJW@aol.com)
Lou Dee (hyperbeats@hotmail.com)
?????? (HoUsKiTteN@aol.com)

I was thinking we could meet around the entrance about 1-2AM. Does that sound
good to anyone? I'm open to suggestions. If anyone else is going and would
like to meet up, e-mail me ASAP.

My friend Sarah has a respirator because she used to be a house painter.
She wants to attach mandibles and wear it to a rave.  I think she might
also need some antennae!

ok, tom, now here's what you do...  make sure you tell her that you
haven't showered in a couple of weeks.. (break her in easy.. 3 months is
hard to take at first.. trust me, i've got experience)..  then impress
her with your giant collection of death metal records (on vinyl, 'cause
you're that cool..)  and when she asks why you call your landlord Mom,
just say, "she's kinda crazy..  she likes that stuff..  she makes me
PB&J sandwitches before i go out raving, too...  I swear she's really
not my mom!

If she goes for it, your SET!!  i've never gotten that far, but i hear
you get to kiss her and stuff..  GOOD LUCK!!

hehe..

Bleah,

I finally got my computer hooked back up in my new pad, and I was 600
messages behind... rather than read all of it I deleted them all, so if
anyone said anything of importance to me on the list, please re-mail as
E-mail :)

Dan K

p.s. It's good to be back on:)

[David Schwanke]  For what my comments are ever worth.. :)
I like to wear them because I think it fits the 'industrial' side of 
raving. Being in warehouses, with heavy sound and solid lights, it just 
seems to fit the 'mood' rather well. I didnt even know they were used as a 
certain drug accessory.

For that matter, whats the thing with blowing someone with their 
blower/inhaler? Ive had three people from different raves now ask me to do 
this and I was like what?!? why?. I was worried there would be something 
funky on it/in it/whatever.

Subject: {pb-cle} tip for promoters
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

	This tip is mainly for promoters throwing parties on Friday nights.

	Lately I've had a rash of promoters booking me and then going to
book a flight without checking with me.  Whenever I take a booking I always
tell the promoter to let me know the flight info BEFORE you pay for it.
Lately they have been ignoring that and just booking flights regardless.

	This is the problem.........

	I actually have a job.  A real job that I can't just skip out on to
catch a flight to go to a party.  I'm getting flights for early afternoon
and I work till 6pm.

	This isn't just me.  I have a lot of D.J. friends that get
inconvenienced by this.  All we ask is that you check with us about the
flight info BEFORE you pay for it.  After it's paid for it is too late.
Most promoters book nonrefundable tickets, so they can't get their money
back when this problem arises and it adds to the budget and the break even
point.

	It just seems like good business this way.

Sorry to vent but I'm in the process of trying to fix another flight right now.






 Peace and Love

Hi all :-)
     A few weeks ago someone on this list mentioned that they were interested
in purchasing the audio production software "Acid"  

     You ever it was who posted they're interest....did you ever try it out???
I'm looking for some reviews:-)   

           Much Thanks

no i didnt see it but as one of manny's largest critics (i hope he gets run
over by a pop bus...or falls off of  a cliff or something) i would really
appriciate it if someone could save it for me or at least tell me for sure
what issue its in...a laugh at his expense is definately worth the time and
effort to find a copy. thanx

This isn't rave related, but it is semi-Hyperreal related, and I'm 
happy, so --

I got my AUTOGRAPHED and INSCRIBED copies of Alexander and Ann Shulgin's 
_PIHKaL_ and _TIHKaL_ in the mail today.  Ahh.  I pays to meet people on 
newsgroups who know people ... (now if only their bud Albert Hoffman 
would inscribe a copy of his book for me while he's still alive ...) 

Incidentally, the actual copy of _PIHKaL_ that is a book (not the copy 
on Hyperreal) is much, much longer than the On-line version.  The first 
half is basically the story of part of Shulgin's life -- up to the death 
of his first wife, and including the meeting of and love-story with his 
present wife and fellow researcher, Ann.  The On-line version, or 
"Hyper-PIHKaL" is really just a condensed introduction with guide to the 
phenethylamines.  And frankly, I think I prefer a good story with my 
phenethylamines (and with my tryptamines too, in the case of _TIHKaL_).

OK, I know everybody likes this guy and all, but don't you think that
is a little too much?  I mean posing for pictures while DJing.  As far
as I'm concerned that is taking away from what is important (the
music) and focusing that attention on the hype (the "pussy-shaving"
rob).  When I heard him play he acted like he was god, and although it
was fun to get siced and all, he wasn't all that great.  I left
partway through, but from what I heard he was trainwrecking songs a
whole bunch.  

Am I wrong and this guy somehow has the amazing ability to preform an
incredible set while posing for pictures and throwing water bottles
into the crowd? Or is it all about him just having a name for himself.

This is all partly fueled by my recent realizations having to do w/
booking and how big somebodies name is, so take it as what it is,

Judging by his set in Cleveland...you're wrong.  His set was amazing,
maybe you caught him on an off night? I really don't know.  But if he can
put out a tremendous set while hyping up the crowd even more by posing for
pictures and handing out water, more power to him.  He definitly didn't
come across as arrogant at all when I saw him, exactly the opposite.
Seemed completely in touch with the crowd, which just pushed the vibe up
even further...

them at all. Dont ya think?

Peace,
Luke

What ever happened to the rave, Joy, in Pitt?  And who was promoting it?  
Wasn't it supposed to be Aug 22 or something?

So that means that I only have this friday at SEnse and Aug 11 with 
dieselboy at SCJ to look forward to before I go back to Columbus.  I am 
beginning to get teary-eyed :(

I don't want to live in Columbus now.  I am going to miss everyone and 
stuff.

plus the fact the crowd reacts to the way he acts. he gives off a killer vibe
and that is also a HUGE part of the party.

Judging by his set in Cleveland...you're wrong.  His set was amazing,
maybe you caught him on an off night? I really don't know.  But if he can
put out a tremendous set while hyping up the crowd even more by posing for
pictures and handing out water, more power to him.  He definitly didn't
come across as arrogant at all when I saw him, exactly the opposite.
Seemed completely in touch with the crowd, which just pushed the vibe up
even further...

well after some asking around this is what we came up with:
i put <meta> tags in many of the pages telling search engines to ignore
these pages, but this isnt enforced by many engines.
brian is putting most of the pages in the pb-cle heirarchy in the
robots.txt file @ hyperreal, which more robots look at.

i hope this works out!

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, as well as some somewhat related concert events, just testing
this out and we'll see what the reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   [1]trout@hyperreal.org


please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

	The track that Robert played is called 'Brown Acid' Contains Adam
Beyer, Underworld, Pink Floyd as well as the Helen Savage intro and the
Brown Acid Warning. This mix is on Robert's TECHNO tape that will be
available at PHORM.

Anyone heading there this weekend or that may just happen to be in Europe? I

BOREALIS, saturday 8th august in
Montpellier (France) featuring (in no particular oderer of importance):

- J.Rob (France)
- Cari Lekebusch
- Green Velvet ( & Cajmere)
- Marco Carola
- Adam Beyer
- Jeff Mills (3 decks + 909)
- Jeff Craven
- Scan X (live)

Look for few of these names to be in Toronto on Nov 28 for pHryL.'s
aniversary event (5 of them are already confirmed, and we are shooting for
possibly 2 more). And that's not all!

...so yesterday i went to future sounds, and was looting the
stickers/flyers like i always do, and this gimpy house dj guy and his
girl were taking FOREVER to listen to all of the records... they had
like 50, so there was this envelope that i never looked in before and
to my amazement, there were flyers for

tunnel vision
freee
daedalus
all natural
millennium
house of consciousness (da flop :)

i was super-surprised. i had never seen the majority of em cause i got
all my rave info from the r-o-m back then + didn't make it to too many
anyways.

unfortunately there aren't THAT many flyers left, and i took the only
tunnel vision one (i think it was there especially for ME :) so if you
want em you best hurry.

I'm sorry, but I want to add:  If your clit is pierced incorrectly, your 
nerves could be damaged and you will lose a lot of feeling.  This is not 
a risk for the prince albert piercing.  Therefore, (ahem), because of 
the danger factor, the clit piercing is *slightly* more hard-core.

--Of course in order for one to do clitoral piercings professionally, 
one must be propery trained and certified -- more so than for other 
piercings.  I was told this by an employee at Piercology in Columbus 
(geez, I know I spelled that wrong) when I got my outer labia pierced 
... the girl who jabbed me said she was not yet certified to do the 
other one. ;-)
Not that I would ever get that done ...

Amanda

i think i would need that info about the throwdown in france nine months
in advance |thanks anyway|.  teleportation, it's close; i'd say 2032
(techno is really going to pick up).  i would really really go |to see|:

laurent garnier
hardfloor
rob de la
speedy j

what about you guys?

on a similar note, i just got my hypothalamus pierced.  it was highly
invasive, this is a long term beneficial procedure that provides
constant non-diminishing pleasure.  tilt your head, you got some
adrenaline.  on the serious nanotechnologic note:  one day we will learn
how to put "bots" in/on our hypothalamus and other noteable endocrine
parts (adrenal, thyroid, ya) and people will abuse this process.  no, i
am not talking about steriods...i'm talking bots!

OKay, well I know that the ILL STYLE ROCKERS are out of Akron, I am pretty

I agree, whole-heartedly... dont mistake confidence, enthusiasm, and effort

proved just how versatile and adaptable he really is, both in his ability to

the man who was on the tables when we got there around 10:30 played really
good records.  he experimented with some tricks that didn't quite work out. 

the girl from detroit - dj punisher? - laid down some great tracks, nice pre-
headliner housey grooves.

the next dj opened with a two-minute "you are about to be rocked by robert
delagaulthier" in the voice of that guy who tries to talk in a deep scary
voice during movie commercials.  then he surprisingly went straight into hard
house with "special k," and he didn't let up the whole night.  it was a great
set of semi-smooth trance.  his style and his selections got harder and harder
... 

around 3am he stopped, playing like he was gonna go home.  but we all knew he
was just playin, he pulled cheezey tricks to get the house bumpin, like he
would wave his hands in the air and put his hand to his ear and look at the
ceiling like he was hulk hogan or something.  it was arrogant but really
enjoyable and funny, a lot more kids came out on the floor and it was just
whistle-blowin, hand-clappin, foot-stompin, lighter-pushin madness.  his final
encore was underworld's "born slippy" (original version), which anyone who has
the _trainspotting_ soundtrack should be able to ... well, trainspot :)

this event was the most music-oriented party i've ever been to.  basically it
was like byod ... some kids quietly sniffin in the back corners but nobody
pushed me the whole time.  i think that's a good sign - when a lot more kids
are looking for nose candy than pushing it.  

trilogy provided a comfortable venue, with sofa-padded lounges and clean
bathrooms.  there were a few confused meatheads with their miniskirt-clad
dates at the bar, but i didn't mind them.  oh and it wasn't hot!  props to the
trilogy climate-control crew.  it was kind of hard to meet ppl there because
the sound system was so powerful that it pervaded every level of the house.  i
made most of my friends there in the bathroom and in the parking lot ...

someone told me that there would be an open bar, but i found this liar (she
knows who she is) and said that it didn't work out as planned.  that's totally
okay, i just want to thank her for inviting me because i wouldn't have gone
otherwise.  :)

robert delagaulthier is the bomb.  did anyone see him in detroit the next day?

got rhymes -

ohio this past year beating out ILL STYLE @ the hip hop convention here
in columbus and takin out the MIDWEST ROYALS @ INNOCENT down in cinci
...the new cru here in da 614 is RAW FOOTAGE cru headed by Aron & his

right, 'cause getting your labia pierced is one thing, but getting your
clit pierced, now *that's* crazy, right?  ;)

i don't think you can be *too* obsessed with something...  not that i'm
obsessed with self-mutilation (although i am getting my tongue pierced
shortly after i return to pbgh..  hmmm..   maybe i am...)..  in any
case..  i did research on the prince albert because supposedly once you
get it done, all the agony and pain and bleeding is worth it, due to the
incredible sensations..  i believe it..  my as-of-yet limited experience
with piercings (just the eyebrow) has shown me how interesting something
can feel when you feel it on the inside of your skin... it's really
freaky at first..  i think that a prince albert would be good, if i
could just have it done and healed all at the same time.. kinda like the
pulling off a band-aid approach... anyway, i'm rambling, and this isn't
a piercing mailing list...

Speaking of first parties, which party was everyone's first? (I'm
sure this subject comes up every once in a while.)

Mine was 420 (the first one, in the giant warehouse). I was absolutely 
amazed that this sort of thing went on. There were so many people,
and you could dance anyway you wanted without getting a strange look
from anyone. I loved it. Still, I didn't actually 'start' going to
raves until just about a year ago, at Electric Playground in the
Fun 'n Stuff in Macedonia. Had a great time there, and have been
averaging about 2-3 per month since. (Don't even want to think about
the amount of money I've spent!)

that may very well be a typo, because i'm pretty sure this
party will be in columbus, since A2 is a production co. that

Sorry, but I have to be anal about this. I don't usually get the
chance to point out when someone is wrong about music on this
list, because frankly, I don't know nearly as much as many of you.
The track 'born slippy.nuxx' is the one on the Trainspotting 
soundtrack. The original 'born slippy', as far as I know, is
only available on the 3 track cd single along with the '.nuxx'
and '.telematic' versions. IMHO the original is the best of the
three tracks. I'm getting a cable modem hooked up next week and will
make an mp3 of the other two tracks if anyone is interested.

Well, I am still recovering from Aphrodite's set last night...and all I can
say is wow. Wow. WOW. Needless to say, I was wowed. If you missed it, you
missed out. I'mnot even going to try and go through the whole night because
his set was forever long, and totally fabulous. *sigh*

If all the music in London is this good...I am moving.

Not to mention, if half the guys in London had as stellar eyes as that guy,
I'd move too. But I suppose that's a little off the subject.... ;)

WOW.

DISCLAIMER:
(just as a side note for any of you who might be wondering, the set was
enjoyable *minus* the stellar eyes, which I did not notice until I was talking
to him *afterwards*...and no, I am not a DJ Whore. I didn't throw myself at
him, despite "who he was"....I hate girls like that and I just had to add this
little disclaimer because I didn't want to be confused with the likes of those
types.)

In a message dated 98-08-07 08:47:13 EDT, you write:

<< .  i did research on the prince albert because supposedly once you
 get it done, all the agony and pain and bleeding is worth it, due to the
 incredible sensations..  i believe it..  my as-of-yet limited experience
 with piercings (just the eyebrow) has shown me how interesting something
 can feel when you feel it on the inside of your skin... it's really
 freaky at first..  i think that a prince albert would be good, if i
 could just have it done and healed all at the same time.. >>

My boyfriend used to have FOUR pieces of jewelry in his genitals alone.
Unfortuantely, that was prior to meeting me (always a day late and a dollar
short...). And the last frennel (sp?) he actually pierced himself (too many
drugs I think...). But as for me and my two cents...NO THANKS on the genital
piercings. If I see someone coming at my crotch with a needle, you can bet I
am not going to just sit there and let them stick me :) As for you all who
have them done...more power to you! I am just not interested in that kind of
pain. I guess you're more punk than me :)

how the hell does he go thru an airport metal detctor..  and don't you
run out of places to pierce Mr. Happy eventually?  I thought one or two
was hardcore, but 4????  That's crazy..

> And the last frennel (sp?) he actually pierced himself (too many

ok.. i take it back... *THAT* is crazy..  

> If I see someone coming at my crotch with a needle, you can bet I
> am not going to just sit there and let them stick me :)
yeah...  it's gotta take an amazing amount of self-control to sit there
while someone sticks pointy pain-causing devices in your most sensitive
areas..  i wonder if they tie you down..  i would flinch like a mofo..

For all those people who are going to be making a 
weekend out of the Formation Tour in Cleveland,
August 15....This weekend in Cleveland is a special
one because Little Italy will be celebrating their
100th Year Anniversary of the Feast of the Assumption.
This is a HUGE street Feast with booths, games, rides,
gambling, and the BEST lemon ice (from Corbo's bakery)
and other Italian foods. The Feast starts Thursday 
night and goes through Sunday. It happens on Murray
Hill in between Euclid and Mayfield Rds, so if you are
planning on driving through that area, watch out for 
all the crazy Italians. ;)

yeah yeah, booty house!!!
so what is everyone's favorite booty house track??
(note: the following content may be offensive to some.)

my #1 has to be dj funk's "dirty bitch" (anyone know the name of the 12" 
it's on??? oh, I also like that "if you want a pussy ride, don't be shy, 
don't ask why" who's that by?)

but then among the records I have, my favorites would have to be:
dj deeon "da dik suk" (my booty house anthem)
dj funk "bitches"

E
(one girlie who was truly disappointed w/ ghetto booty battle)

Gee, no I had never heard jungle before last night. Prior to that I had
assumed this "jungle" stuff that people were talking about comprized of a few
bird calls, the soothing sounds of running streams and a random native
chanting every now and again. Thanks for assuming my ignorance. I guess my
previous posts hadn't proven me tribal enough.

I'm debating whether to go to this or to the Goa Trance party in Columbus.

1) First of all, there's no doubt that Noel Sanger is great as a dj.  But
what's he like live?  Does he even perform trance?  The Beatbox 2000 cd of
his is among the best progressive, euphoric trance releases I've ever
heard, but what's up with him these days?  Anyone?

2) I need a style run down on these others.  What does each spin?

Angel Alanis
DJ Bizz
Mark Almaria
Josh Da Funky 1
Jason Dunne a.k.a. DJ Lazer

As a side note, why the heck do I even have to ask this?  Why hasn't the
promoter already told us who each is and what they play?  It's a sign of
disorganization as far as I'm concerned.  Also, did you hear the voice
mail message?  I had to basically guess which button to push and then I
had to call a second promoter to hear the driving instructions, and this
message sounded like crap with all the pausing and call waiting beeping
interrupting the instructions.  Did the promoter even listen to it
afterwards?  If they can't do the most obvious things right, just imagine
what the event will be like.  

Before I waste my time and money driving all the way over there, I'd like
to get input from this list as to what they're doing.  After all, I can
always hear Noel Sanger on mixtape.  Are you guys making the trip?

Braden

hi kids.  spyboy david here.  i was going through my cd archives today and
came across a maxi-single for emf's "unbelievable" from '91 ... does anyone
know who their mc is?  they're from england.  i didn't know there were two
afrika bambaataa/dj fashion remixes on there?  :)

right now i'm listening to _the white room_ from the klf ... the insert says
the mc's are ricardo rap, isaac bello, and black steel.  with manda beatmaster
and major malfunktion on 303's and 808's, also from england ... call me crazy
but this cd has some tracks that sound like precursors to jungle.  little did
i know at the time ... !

does anyone know what these ppl are up to now?

the little prince

I think two of my favorites have to be two of Cajmere's tracks, and I think
they are titled: "Beat that Bitch with a Bat" and "I Ain't Fucked All Week" .
If they arent titled that, then they have those as the predominant lyrics.
Both tracks have the same basic BPM as "Perculator" but have more of a booty
house flavor than Perculator. Both tracks, incidentally, I have heard that
Barada spins (my brother dj kevy kev heard him spin all three tracks on three
turntables once, integrating all three, I guess it was pretty funny ;-) ).
Cant wait to see him next Saturday at Phorm here in good ol' Cleveburg...

yes I believe there will be tapes available at Trilogy next Saturday at

Actually, there will be tapes of Robert, but they will be from Germany
sets.  One is Techno and the other is Speed Garage.  We nor Viktor will not
release his sets from Tragedy or Biz.

Speaking of booty house (which I happen to believe is the most fun stuff
around these days), other than Funk and Urban, has anyone heard any other
worthwhile booty DJs spinning (not their tape, actually playing out)?

My first rave was Superfly back in may of 96 :)

I showed up as Tik-Tak was playing some ambient jungle and then he
stopped the record that was playing and switched over to ragga stuff. 
I didn't know what to think at the time, and the incredible bass
pounding my chest.  Then Dust came on.  Who played some trance type
stuff.  Then DNA was up . . . . DAMN!  At this point I had gotten over
the initial worrying about looking stupid dancing and was getting real
into it, but it wasn't untill somebody came around with the baby
powder that I went buckwild :)  I saw some guy w/ a green see through
visor spraying some white stuff on the ground and I wondered what it
was.  Then I put my foot on it to realize it made the ground slippery!
 I started gliding around on it and having a general party.  I must
have looked like I was completely whacked out, cause I wasn't dancing
normal that's for sure.
Well anyways, DNA was great.  The best of all was the build-ups.  I
had heard techno before, but never like this and never this loud.  The
ambience would be filling the room swirling around all over the place
and then you would hear this tiny little kick drum roll far off in the
distance and it slowly got louder and louder untill the entire
dancefloor was in a mad frenzy, and then the house beat would drop and
the strobes would go off and the intellibeams would go nuts.  It was
great :)

Well that's enough of that,

     In the past 7 years of going to parties there have been times when I
have doubted the positive nature of raving.  Being at a phat function and
getting turned away and harrased by police , pushed or pulled excessivley
and mostly seeing  overdoses have at times made me question the positive
vibe and ideals of plur.
     Tonight SENSE reaffirmed my faith that there truly is something more
than just pure hedonism on the part of both the kidz and promotors.  Major
props to all those who donated their creativity, time , effort and
resources into this benefit.

<RANT OFF>

  I liked the numerous paintings and photography.  I cant remember many of
the artists names, but i particularly liked the alien themed large
canvases, the more urban, almost grafiti style pictures (Jermaine JOhnson),
the black&whites (Deirdre Mitchell), a really nice photo taken from a
morning at a Family Affair, and last but not least this really nifty day
glow piece with many dancers.  It looked especially fantastic with the
black light next to the DJ booth later in the evening. DJ's and producers
are artists as well with the added ability to make someone wanna get up and
dance and participate, but this piece featuring  22 dancers gave an added
touch to the flesh and blood dancers on the floor and around the space.
(which i should add was a beautiful and clean gallery  and hope no
permanent damage was done)


     I don't think all the DJ's who had scheduled to join could make it for
some reason or other but major props to those that did spin. When I first
got to the dancefloor it was a live MC doing some ragga (dancehall?) but
still quite good.  Sine played a heavish jungle set but wasn't quite in the
mood for Jungle.  7 up and Zemo really started getting things grooving as
did excellent sets by Ryan Mathews and Product 19 who are probably my
current fav local DJ's (well at least on the techno scene)  FInally major
props to Dustin who was able to make it to end things on an intergalactic
speed out-house booty jungle up.  Kevin didnt play and i may have missed
one more two but yinz can correct me later.

I had a blast!
Thanks & double plus good plur,

jeffrey

I don't have this info anymore and I'm wondering if someone could repost 
who'll be spinning at the trance party in Columbus tonight.  I know 
where it is and how much ... just would like to be reminded of who's 
spinning.

I guess this means I'm probably going to be there.

Amanda

I was only there for 2 hours (from 9-11) but everything was real cool.

The dancefloor was too small and hot, but whatever, it was OK.  Zemo
was doin' a good job, he even played a ambient jungle track.  It's
nice to see people crossing borders like that.

Then DJ D and Jimmy came on.  Starting out w/ ragga/raggae and moving
into old school rap and even some disco!  Kimmy tor it up w/ his
dancehall MCing skills.  Much better than the MC for original bubbles
at LIBAD.  he should be a jungle MC.

Art was good.  I saw some of it already at a graf show I went to, but
it's all good.  They were passing out MAD wine.  "Are you 21?" "Yes"
"Ok."

:)

why aren't there any more after-hours parties?  i don't like going to 
parties
if i know that i will have to arrange some after-party entertainment 
myself.
(promoters take note)

david the spy

[David Schwanke]  Heh. Im kinda glad there arent after parties :) I always 
feel like im missing out because I prefer to go home and crash after a 
party. But then again a good party breaks you and only leaves you for a 
need a for a smoke.

i can't help but reply to this one.  we don't listen to CDs all that much
but in the CD player for the last few months has been the klf, & the stereo
MCs.
the roots!!  we must all be on the same wavelength.

Glad to see your entusiasm, hopefully 700 or so people have the same
outlook as you.  Not only is the jungle room off the hook, but the techno
room has some serious talent as well.  The third (chill) room is one to
definetely make you want to kick back and just lose yourself in the groove.
 I know I am sure to have a good time.  
Definetely,
Matthew

Mine was Crusade in Portland, Maine.  About 900 kids in an old boat
warehouse..just like 420!  I had no concept about techno at the time...it
all sounded like one big song.  That promoter (KC & the Sunrise Gang)
started throwing parties in Portland every 2 or 3 months.  (He was the only
one that threw them in Maine at the time.)  I was hooked.  They kept
getting bigger & bigger & bigger.  At the peak was Grin (4500 people) with
line ups you wouldn't believe in amazing spaces with buses coming from
Baltimore & Montreal & NYC.  Oh yeah...

Hey kids,
  crystalize had an awesome vibe going, really good music,but it was 
really hot! I had a really good time and met some of the nicest kids!! 
It was all good until the party got busted by the cops and they shut  it 
down!!But I think all and all that most of everybody had a good time.
PLUR,

~~~~Jessica~~~~

     ok, once more a weekend of auditory nerve abuse.
     400 more miles on my little gold rx-7, 5000 more
     dead brain cells and a bunch more friends.

     :]

     gotta say something about atomic: there weren't
     enough people with big pants there :P. the crowd
     was friendly, although i had a strange experience
     with a couple guys who were drunk off their heads.
     need more raver kids. nuff said. oh, and rob 
     sherwood's set was too laid back for me to dance
     to.

     anyway, the strange experience: i was out on the 
     floor and bumped into two girls i had met there
     a few weeks before. we said hi, i told them to 
     come to sense, and that was about it. a few
     minutes later, i noticed they were being harassed
     by two losers who had forgotten their pheromone
     spray and how to shave their upper lips. one of
     the girls, sarah (how come everyone i know is 
     called sarah?) leaned over to me, said 'we'll
     be right back' and ran for cover with her friend,
     leaving me with the duo of don juans. so one of
     them sways over and starts talking to me.
     'do you know where those women went?'
     'no.' he walks away, then a couple seconds later
     is back.
     'can you help me?'
     'uh, i don't know.' whaaatever.
     'i'm looking for a woman, you know, to bang.'
     i shit you not, this is what he said, verbatim.
     it seemed like his command of the english 
     language was pretty limited, so finesse was 
     obviously out of the question. i'm not sure 
     what he said to sarah, but i'm sure it can't 
     have been tactful. but what do i look like, a
     pimp? (wiseguys - shut up)
     'i think you're here on the wrong night.'
     'what?'
     'why don't you go upstairs?' maybe he could 
     slip some roofies into somebody's drink, i dunno.
     'ok. how do i get upstairs?' 
     'up the stairs. over there.' they left.

     whatever.

     why don't these people stay home with a good 
     porno flick? they shouldn't be allowed to breed.
     oh, i didn't say that. that wasn't plur. sorry.

     that was metropol night. or at least what i 
     remember of it.

     then there was sense. a rave in an art gallery 
     just has to be interesting, or just downright
     strange. some of my friends showed up all covered
     in body glitter, and were like 'we need to find
     DRUGS'. in an art gallery? yeh right. later on
     they found me, and said they had found drugs, and
     then promptly disappeared (i assume left the 
     party) which was disturbing. as far as i'm
     concerned, responsible ravers tell at least one
     of their friends that they're leaving the party,
     and don't just disappear. annnyyway.

     the ambience was somehow new york, or maybe london
     without the accents and annoying british people. :]

     it was fun tho, and i got rid of all my pre-flyers.
     the little dance room was viciously hot, unfortunately.

     oh, whoever that was who went crazy over me, sorry for
     being so non-plussed. i can't remember your name,
     either, which is really embarrassing. i love you too :]
     (!?)

     late saturday i decided to go to crystallize. it was
     kind of a toss-up because nobody wanted to go with 
     me, so about 9pm i put the infoline number in my 
     cellphone and started driving.
 
     i got there around 11:30, only getting marginally lost
     once. the venue was pretty cool, one large dance room,
     and a large chillout room on another floor, plus a
     small chillout/vending room. there were wet bars in 
     both large rooms, which annoyed the hell out of me.
     alcohol has the potential to kill a party, although
     i don't think it did all that much to this one. it
     also has the potential to kill people when used in
     combination with various drugs, which is even more
     of a concern. but since when do we care about that...

     the music, the most important part of any party, was 
     slamming. the sound in the large room was adequate
     but hardly outstanding for DJ work - when the live
     act (noel sanger) came on it was just plain underpowered.
     live music has to be loud. i won't complain because i
     forgot my earplugs. anyway, i was really happy 'cause
     i got to do all the dancing i couldn't do last week,
     altho the main dance area got progressively hotter as
     the night went on.

     open tables in the chillout area, which was totally 
     cool. the dance areas had beautiful surfaces, wood 
     on the main room, and hard tile in the chillout. if i
     never have to dance on carpet, gravel, or dirt again
     i will be one happy little raver boy.

     :P

     there weren't many pittsburgh kids at this party.
     what's up, ya need your beauty sleep? hi to liquid 
     and melissa and the rest of you that i don't know 
     properly yet.

     big shout-out to braden, majorly messed up but far
     from obnoxious. gotta love them chemicals. speaking
     of which, there seemed to be a good supply of decent
     quality at this party, but i wasn't in the mood. but
     cool anyway... email me, braden.

     made friends with noel sanger and nicole henry. noel's
     guitar work was just plain aweinspiring. i couldn't 
     hear his keyboards, which sucked, and nicole had to 
     sing without monitors. they really weren't set up for
     this act, which was a pity. but i sat on the speaker
     stacks and just listened, and it was well worth it.
     they are two really nice people, and i love the fact
     that they were out there dancing for the rest of the
     party after their set, totally approachable.

     liquid said something about the vibe being superficial
     at this party, which may have been so. i found it much
     like every party, pretty mixed.

     one thing i wanna mention is that somebody stole 
     randy's money, which is absolutely despicable. 

     in general, tho, two cool parties this weekend. next
     week: the phorm experience. :]

     hugz + plur
     geekyboy

Well my first actual RAVE was LSD (Lets start dancing) back on newyears a 
few years ago put on by Local13. I can beat all you flyer collectors for 
their first raves cuz I have the poster! :)
My first rave like experience however was a shitty little weekly thing back 
in nj.  A friend of mine was only going to get some more 'stuff'.  But I 
hung around, scared as shit at all these people in wierd clothing listening 
to what sounded like suped up mod files from the computer. I remember 
looking accross from the smart bar (the place was a hotel normally so they 
actually had a bar but converted it for the evening) and seeing a small sea 
of whacked out crazy kids dancing to funky ass lights in a foggy room. 
Thinking to myself, this is soooo cool. Next room over was some dj spinning 
from a crapass turntable doing sorta jazz stuff with all sortsa people 
smokeing up all over the place.  Technically it was probably a really 
shitty party in comparison, but it was my first experience at the scene.

Now adays i pretty much hit everything in pittsburgh any anything outside 
that I can scam a ride to.  I wont even being to predict how much cash ive 
pushed into it. Has to be on the order of a thousand or two including 
enhancements. I couldve had a really kickass computer with that. But such 
is the cost of hard core entertainment in pgh.

Speaking of first parties, which party was everyone's first? (I'm
sure this subject comes up every once in a while.)

Mine was 420 (the first one, in the giant warehouse). I was absolutely
amazed that this sort of thing went on. There were so many people,
and you could dance anyway you wanted without getting a strange look
from anyone. I loved it. Still, I didn't actually 'start' going to
raves until just about a year ago, at Electric Playground in the
Fun 'n Stuff in Macedonia. Had a great time there, and have been
averaging about 2-3 per month since. (Don't even want to think about
the amount of money I've spent!)

my first was "that thing" @ washington co. fairgrounds....it wasnt 
really noteable, other than the fact that it was very wonderful in a 
"ive never seen this before" way....i was on acid, and it was really 
fucking me up, so i dont really remember too much, although the part of 
dieselboy's set i heat while lucid was rad as hell.....probably the 
reason i like jungle so much.....actually, i had head jungle before, but 
i just thought it was "techno"....oh well, raving is stupid anyway
toM
p.s. and i have NO clue how much $$ ive put into it....turntables are 
expensive (i split the price with my friend, but still) and records 
arent cheap either......plus admissions, etc.....

I really get a kick out of it when djs mix some of the 'old shit' into 
their sets, example was Its a Jungle Sometimes by the robitix at SENSE. 
 Someone did a tripped out ironman a while ago. Does anybody else find this 
cool and interesting? Hearing some older more normal tracks mixed into a 
genre that just wasnt made for it.

The best was "I want to be a hippie" when the gabber cremated it at libad. 
 The vibe was INSANE when people realized what i was. And half of it was 
the fact that everyone was like 'wtf, i recognize this, wait somethings 
wrong, ohh my god its! Then blamo everyone's singing along at 6k miles an 
hour.

Can we say Sinatra with a spacedrum at mskw1's cookout? :)
"Like this guy! I always see this guy! I wanna see some new faces!" (sorry, 
flashback)

Some stuff that I would LOVE to hear at a rave sometime, either alone or 
mixed up well:

SpeedRacer!! (or any AlphaTeam for that matter)
Psychosonic.
Messiah.
Some of the 'classics' that come off of cds like Rave Til Dawn and the best 
of rave volumes.
Ottorongo's Fuck You.
The Movement's Jump
Any pragakahn.
Some 2 Unlimited
Some two little boys.
Any Dynamix II
Apotheosis' O Fortuna
James Brown is Dead (Or any L.A. Sytle)

Or is all of this too geriatric?
Please dont let me be alone in this.  I wont even pretend to say I can mix 
or spin but this is the stuff I used to play on my hour at WRCT when I was 
training (which I never finished cuz im a lazy bastard and never got around 
to turning in the logs/tape). And when I played it I would get all sortsa 
people calling in about 'oh my god I havnt heard that in sooo long, you 
rock'.

So is it like its a bitch to get this stuff on vinyl? Is everyone too young 
to remember it? :) Why is this stuff never heard? Its some damn good tracks 
and fit pretty well into several obvios genres.

i hope you're joking.  i find anything on the "rave til dawn" compilation
embarrassing.  actually i've been a closeted gabber bigot and hardcore bigot
also.  to me, it's all in the same family as celine dion remixes and mtv
party-to-go.

what is it about cheezey music that i am not appreciating?

that other david ... he might be witty, but i don't know about his taste in
music ... :)

don't hurt me -

I just recently moved to Columbus, and decided that I would go
to the trance party Saturday night. I have decided that I am
officially a trance fan. Let me say that this was the best I
have ever seen this location (400 East Second ave) look. Everything 
was blacklit and there was flourescent string all over that looked
like lasers. There was also a table where you could get body 
painted so you would glow in the dark. The night started out on a good 
note when the second song I heard when I walked in was Juno
Reactor. I love that stuff! The guy who was spinning actually wasn't.
He was just playing cds one after another. His selection was good,
but the mixing was non-existant. One strange thing I noticed early
on was several girls in tight dresses and a few white hat looking
guys. No problem, I thought. I danced quite a bit until about 2:00,
and then I found a tab and took it. I'm still not exactly sure what
was in it, but I am guessing that it was a combination of MDE and
MDMA, because I was a bit spaced out at the beginning, but I also
had a lot of energy and felt nice. A little after two, many more
people who looked like they just left the bars started showing up.
It was kind of strange. They would stay in a corner of the dancefloor
and dance in their club-like way, the girls grinding away and the
guys mainly posing. Of course, this made me want to dance all the 
more. There was one girl there who was totally trashed out of her
mind, stumbling all over and slurring at anyone who would listen.
I have to give some credit though, everyone looked like they were
having fun, and there wasn't any trouble. There was also another
girl in a long black dress who was attempting to dance like
the ravers. She would stop and watch for a couple minutes, and then
commence trying to jump around in her high-heels. Pretty funny
stuff. 
  Overall, it was definitely worth the $5 admission for some good
danceable music, and a bit of culture clash.

You could write a book on what the KLF have been doing.  A slightly
outdated FAQ is at: http://www.club.innet.be/~ind1191/music.htm

Right now, I recommend looking for the 2K single "Fuck the Millenium,"
which shouldn't be too hard to find.

"Crystallized 2" - A College Course Guide

By Braden Albert

Geography:  Although I've pretty much grown up in NE Ohio, this was my
first trip to Lorain.  As I drove there down an enjoyable stretch of 90W,
it occurred to me what a good idea it is to have parties in second tier
cities outside of Cleveland, Pittsburg h and Columbus.  There are plenty
of unique spaces just waiting to be discovered in such places and the
prices are probably lower too.  Plus, it's always fun to venture into a
virgin space.  It really adds to the general appeal of the party. 

Architecture:  The Eagle's Nest had a near perfect layout.  There were two
rooms of music, three chillout areas and a hallway that served as a sixth
room.  As dawn ushered in the morning daylight bliss, I discovered a roof
that was easily accessible from one of the chillouts -- essentially a
seventh room.  To watch the sunrise from this vantage point added a
wonderful touch as well as a great view of the clouds and the surrounding
city.  Although I love skating rinks, the option of hanging out in a
semi-l ight, relatively quiet chillout room allows for friend making and
conversation - which as far as I'm concerned is one of the greatest joys
of going to parties.  This space had it in a big way. 

Economics:  In terms of price, I think everything was just right.  $20 is
a fair fee for a two room party these days - especially with a headliner
like Noel Sanger.  What I was especially proud of was the fact that water
was only $1.  This allowed everyon e to stay fully hydrated without having
to go broke.  When the H2O ran out upstairs, the bartender downstairs even
gave water away for free - a nice gesture, I thought. 

Physical Education:  The wooden floor of the main room was a nice bonus. 
Due to the seductive call of overwhelming and compelling beats, there was
no holding back.  And having a floor like that to dance on all night
allowed for a minimal of Sunday aches and pains.  What also got me going
were the cool psychedelic, moving images displayed on the white screen in
the middle of this room.  I'd like to see more of these mixed, ever
evolving, full color graphics at other parties in the future. 

Social Studies:  What made this event so memorable, besides the above, was
the variety of vibes in each of the many rooms.  It was like changing
social channels every time I left one room and entered another.  The
diversity of the group and the wide array of tunes probably allowed for
this.  Whatever the reason, I found it so very easy at this party to meet
and briefly connect with absolute strangers.  And each time I did so, it
took me a little bit higher.  Speaking of which: 

Mathematics:  1 e + 1 e = 5,458 smiles

Music Appreciation:  Although I had a really good time listening to most
of the dj's, the highlight of the show was the singer Nicole who did
soulful things on stage to Noel Sanger's live set that were just goosebump
inducing.  She is absolutely amazing! 

Foreign Language:  I had the pleasure of running into "geekboy" from this
list.  Born in Germany, raised in England and now a native of Pittsburgh,
I had a really excellent time chatting with him.  Henry is anything but a
"geek" and certainly one of the c oolest people I've met in a long while. 
This list seems to be a magnet for outstanding individuals, and the more
we get to know each other, the more meaningful and enjoyable these parties
become.  I also had the pleasure of running into Kate, Lou, Lou D and
Steve Ford.

Definitely....I love it when a dj just drops a sample or a hint of a
tune into the mix...sometimes its just a sample *in* the tune....anyone
else hear that mix MSKW did @ LIBAD where he was cuttin-up between some
funk tune and a Beasties tune that sampled it?  wicked...!

I just love samples and the whole ability to snatch something else
familiar and fuck with it...take a piece from here, another from 
here, add some distortion...

:)  It would be entertaining if the dj had the skills to subtley drop
this stuff in the mix.  There's lots of old tunes that i'd like to hear at
least once in a while......at the same time, alot of djs don't like this
stuff because it was part of the 'rave fad' of a few years ago....

Argh....no 2unlimited though!!!!  why not play c&c music factory then?

Hmmm, I think this stuff is never heard because its 'cheezy' these days...
while most djs like to have fun, very few are actually really goofy on the
tables. :(  You might say theres also the tendancy to avoid 'commercial'
tunes....

     well, i have to say that braden's exuberance was
     certainly infectious, and definitely made my evening
     that much more enjoyable.

     a slight correction on my geographical past, for the
     edification of all and sundry (like you really care:).
     born in hastings, england, of mixed german and english
     ancestry, raised in robertsbridge, england, birnbach,
     germany, rifton, NY, norfolk, CT, uniontown, PA, in
     order. interspersed with various stints in various
     places, europe, etc. at random times. been in pittsburgh
     for almost 2 years now and only just starting to like
     it, mostly thanks to all you wonderful ppl. ihr sind alle
     die beste :P 

     shouts to pb-cle's at crystallize: steve, matt, and the
     rest of you i didn't meet :].

ok first off:

who will be going to the beastie boys show in cle this friday? raise your
hands.

who will be ultra-hardcore and attending both the bb show and phorm? raise
your hands.

*raises both hands*

anyone with any clever ideas about getting together over the course of the
weekend, pipe up now. (like kate's feast of the assumption idea)

i just want to send some love out to my peeps in the 216/440...you know who
you are...respect.

i checked out u4ia on wed nite (nice place, ill be making an appearance
there again shortly --more on that later ;), brillo pad on thurs (very
zythos like vibewise, plus a basement as large as the whole bar for a
dancefloor, pretty fun if you're hanging with your crew, otherwise it might 
feel like you're crashing someones house party...) then, trilogy on fri nite
(and yes it was *fun* and there were no naked strippers dancing in cages),
and crystallized2 on sat...i couldnt handle the rave....the direx were
weak, the space was slammin to be honest, but i just couldn't get my head
around that party...it was an all out laff fest, pix will be developed and
scanned asap, believe. big up the assault photo bizness, seen?

im very happy to hear that other party that was supposed to be in cle the
same nite as phorm isnt happening, only b/c i think it would hurt both
parties, but that point is moot now anyway.

ok, in terms of net meet...i think the best place would be in the back,
under the glass where the lounge is...ie: you walk in, look left, see the
bar, follow the bar all the way to the end and there is a clearing...thats
the quietest, least invasive area i can think of...but like everyone is
saying...after midnite, there really isnt any time when you will want to
pull yourself away from the dancefloor...so i will propose that space for
the net meet, but i wont set a time, thats for you to decide, i doubt i
will be going anywhere but up that nite...

and the drum n bass doesnt stop at 6:30am...at 6:30am in the second room,
pittsburgh's own dj^2 (read dj squared) will be dropping a tremendous set
of afrofunk and jazzy cuts...imagine...over 8 straight hours of top notch
drum n bass..IN CLEVELAND (kate did you faint yet? ;)

viktor wanted me to tell you to PLEASE bring you whistles, lighters, air
horns...anything you can...this party is all about crowd response and
participation and reaction. don't be afraid, prepare to be amazed.

runnin it hot in the nine-eight.

peace,
hossam

    I had my pictures developed ASAP yesterday.....they didn't turn out
that great, but I did get a few great shots (and a lot of okay ones). If
you'd like to see them, meet me at The Avenue in Kent on Thursday or at
Phorm.
    If I had a scanner, I'd do that and put them on my web page, but no
such luck. If anyone has a scanner and would like to do it for me, let
me know and I'll send you the doubles.....

>my first was "that thing" @ washington co. fairgrounds....
woo woo, that was the first party I went to in pgh. I had a good time, 
even though the lines were insane. kimball collins was pretty tasty too 
(gotta love the cheeze)

the first rave I went to was, er, back in the day in seattle. my 
boyfriend in hs was writing for XLR8R (before they moved down to san 
fran.) so we would always get into parties free. "hi, we're from xlr8r 
<blink blink, big smile, wide eyes>" I think the party was called 
evolution... I have no idea who spun, but dubtribe played (I played "air 
volleyball" with sunshine... so crazy) there was a taste lightshow (they 
were doing crazy stuff to charlie and the chocolate factory) and 
excellent lasers. actually, it was also in the warehouse from which my 
analogy of what a killer party is- apparently at around 4 am (I had to 
leave early... parents and stuff) there were so many people dancing & 
sweating that all of the moisture condensed on the ceiling and it 
started to rain. so basically the party was so phat that it generated 
it's own weather system =)

>p.s. and i have NO clue how much $$ ive put into it....turntables are 
>expensive (i split the price with my friend, but still) and records 
>arent cheap either......plus admissions, etc.....
yeah kids, if you want to have any money, don't start to dj. (a lot of 
times it will break down to "well, I could go to that big party or I 
could buy a couple 12"s" and often the 2nd wins)

just announced:

in addition to his set from cheer, andy will be releasing his set from
phunction, remastered to DAT.

it is my favorite jungle tape right now, and having the sound quality
boosted is what i was hoping for.

90 mins of intelligent into hard > steppers > afrofunk > jazzy...some of
the best music thats out there right now...

coming very soon: mixtape from dustin+sine...andy's side is hard (acid)
trance...profiling the resurgence of 'rave' music....(i have heard alot of
rave tracks at parties again...its very baltimore 94-96 for those who
remember)....good shit.

followed by sine's next drum n bass mixtape as of yet untitled...this one
has been months in the making...and will surpass his last tape,
'spectrum'....to be released on bulletproof.

btw, andy was not at sense in pgh last friday, he was playing in buffalo
that nite...did someone possibily confuse him with jay/alaska? :)



peace,
hossam

The problem with getting off the dancefloor will def. be a problem, so
here is what I suggest: we have the first pb-cle net meet directly in
front of the DJ.  It may be tough to manage considering that it will
prob. be really crowded and loud there, but it also might be a lot of
fun.

Good idea, bas idea, what?  If this isn't the case there is a good
chance I won't at the net-meet just because if there is some bomb shit
being played I'm not tryin' to miss it :)

> viktor wanted me to tell you to PLEASE bring you whistles, lighters,
air

Let's just hope people aren't going to blow them as often as they did
at LIBAD, cause if they do, then everyone's gonna be deaf :) 

crawlin' cool in the eight nine,

absolut

i haven't heard anything else by him..  that's the name on the mp3 i

the track is by akenelle...

we sell at least a few copies of that cd-5 at NRM (where i've been working
over the summer) every week...

haven't heard the jungle remix yet, but it sounds like it would be
something cool...


i laughed my ass of the first time i heard that song, by the way... yes,
the lyrics are on the sick/fucked-up side, but *damn*, is it fun-ee... : >

peace,

there were two front page articles today about crystalized being busted. both
of them were ludicrous. it was said that the police called as many police cars
as possible because of the "hostile" environment. they were afraid that a riot
was going to break out. i saw most of what happened and would have to say that
most people left without much protest or question. the entire area was vacated
in about a half hour. 
chalk these articles up to two more things in the media to make our scene look
evil.  nothing was said about dancing or music, just that there were approx.
500 kids from across the state at a nightclub getting high on drugs and
alcohol all night. <shrug> i'm sorry that somehow we have given everyone the
idea that our scene is so simple and revovles so much around drugs. 
12 people were arrested at the party. some of the charges were failure to
dispearse, disturbing the peace, and other minor things, but there were also 4
people charged with drug trafficking (heroin it said), some charged with
possession, and felonious obstructing official business. 
this was the first party that i have been to in 2 years that has been busted.
i hope that i don't experience another one anytime soon.
other than that, i think the party was great. i had so much fun, though i
didn't run into anyone else on the list. the space was near perfect, in my
opinion. with the circumstances, i'm sure there will never be another party
there though. the music kept me dancing almost all night and the vibe was
wonderful. 
hopefully i'll get to see some of you at phorm if i go. i'm still trying to
decide between that and fuck the system. i think i remember reading something
about fuck the system being thrown by shady promoters. is this true? does
anyone else have their doubts about this party?

Man, I dont know about anyone else, but I used to LOVE it when dj's mixed in
the sound bites from porno films, and cartoon episodes (The Jetsons, etc.).
Also, some dj's used to use samples from their own answering machine if they
were funny enough ;-) Anyone who was at Gauthier at Trilogy will remember the
"Fuck ME!" sample,... I am not sure why, but it really fires me up to hear
that stuff mixed in, it sort of "jump starts" my vibe... 

Some other stuff that I would love to hear mixed in again:
-old MC Lyte
-old De La Soul
-Anne Clarke samples  (am I the only one who remembers this girl? Does the
song "Hope Road" sound familiar to ANY of you?) ;-)

I will think of more, I am sure,,, ...to be continued...

I myself was thinking of going to fuck the system for awhile, but now I am
almost positive I am going to Phorm. Not because of potential shady promoters,
but simply because of the lack of desire to travel, and also because I want to
attend Viktor's last party in the States. I think that Fuck the System will be
an incredible party (and so will PHORM), but as has been my experience for
these past 8-9 years, there is always somethin' around the corner. I hope to
see a lot of you at PHORM!!!!  I dont think we have a comprehensive count
going yet, I know that Dave attempted it, but lets get a formal net meet list
going, just so we know who to look for!  Email me if you are going, and I will
post the updated list each day, ok?

 I remember my first rave....

I thought $13 was expensive. I was paranoid as hell my friend Colin told 
me all the drug dealers were out to get me.  And they were I swear.  I 
thought the promoters Sunshine Kids were part of that conspiracy.  I had 
an excellent time dancing and soon I felt drugged up--maybe it was the 
trance later.  The jungle by dieselboy was the highlight of my evening 
and it made me want to continue to go.  I became hooked.

 I remember when I first started this list...

I would just listen to all the details. I would never write.  But now I 
feel a need to express my opinion aloud. I am not scared and even though 
I never officially met anyone I feel like a connection.  I get good 
vibes most of the time.

Now I am addicted to the list and e'mailing in general(cheap 
communication).  I am addicted to raving and dancing etc... if you know 
what I mean.  I gets me horny

mmm.... the smell of the fresh fog and smoke
as the lights flash and coordinate to the beats
the beat sends me away to another place
a place of extreme ecstacy

rave on

Live life with no regrets.....

bEnny

an interesting point about the "lines":)
they werent really lines...they were loads of kids on too many drugs 
just standing around thinking they were in line.....i stood in one 
myself for an hour before realizing that i was really stupid...thats why 
drugs are bad

Thats the plan. :) I told someone the other night "im gunna have to become 
a dj just to have an excuse to buy all this vinyl im falling in love with". 
 But I'm gunna wait till i can set myself up proper. Sudo perminent living 
space, regular income that isnt from my parents or selling dumpster dived 
items.  I dont wanna be 'held back from a love (which im sure it will 
become) because of insufficient funds, nor do I wanna be presented the 
possibilty of accidentally ringing up an even worse debt than I am in now. 
  Thats why I dont read new authors, im afraid ill like their books and 
have to buy the entire series.  As it is im not organizing my Punisher 
comic-book collection because I dont want to know what I dont have, i might 
buy them. :)  Ok so this aint to rave related, but im high as a kite on 
caffeine and thinking/moving/doing a mile a minute.  I think im gunna go 
clean the room and or shuffle and sort a couple of decks of cards.

agreed, this wuz the best utilization of that space i've seen so
far, i think i've been there atleast 3 times now, for mostly ele
mental partys...i think some of the party throwers were art students
because there wuz some interesting glow in the dark pieces hangin
in the dance room...plus the black-light made my star patterned
soccer shirt appear all that much cooler ;P~

other points of interest included a drum circle that went all night
long, a masso-therapist (which i saw amanda utilize...betcha it made
her roll feel all that much better)...soom interesting booths...and a
smart bar that featured 50 cent juices (which wuz much kinder to
the wallet than the $2 water bottles they were sellin)...

<<had a lot of energy and felt nice. A little after two, many more
people who looked like they just left the bars started showing up.
It was kind of strange. They would stay in a corner of the dancefloor
and dance in their club-like way, the girls grinding away and the
guys mainly posing. Of course, this made me want to dance all the 
more. There was one girl there who was totally trashed out of her
mind, stumbling all over and slurring at anyone who would listen.
I have to give some credit though, everyone looked like they were
having fun, and there wasn't any trouble.>>

actually, there was trouble...just outside a group of overly drunk white
supremist jocks made a few derogatory racial remarks to a couple
of black dudes...a fight quickly ensued and security had to break it up
...i'm sorry, but this was just ridiculous!...and this was the primary
downfall of Transfix...it was flyered  to mainly club attendees...i didn't 
see a single flyer at any of the raves i hit...i mean, the only flyer i found 
was one hidden behind a cash register at Rag-o-rama...and usually i get 
handed quite a few flyers for all the local partys...this also explained the 
lack of vibe at the party...i mean the only ravers i saw at the party besides
the ones i brought (amy funkybizz, amy n, & disco), were amanda & her
boyfriend, jack funkdoktah & his friends, and sid of Surreal flyering for
his upcoming party Motive...it's very bizarre to go to a local rave and hardly
see any local ravers!

i think the real reason for the lack of ravers @ Transfix was that Tri-quad 
for some unknown reason chose to throw a 3 keg pool party the same night 
& most of the party kids went there, but the lack of flyering at all the raves
before this party was still unexcuseable...

nevertheless, i thought it was still quite a decent first party for a new cru
...especially at a mere $5 price tag!!...

Argh....no 2unlimited though!!!!  why not play c&c music factory then?

EVERYBODY DANCE NOW! I knew I forgot something. :)

Hmmm, I think this stuff is never heard because its 'cheezy' these days...
while most djs like to have fun, very few are actually really goofy on the
tables. :(  You might say theres also the tendancy to avoid 'commercial'
tunes....

[David Schwanke]  Thats one of the major bummers I have with societies, 
even underground ones.  They have this tendency to say they are the most 
open or the most understanding and yet they look down on a certain style of 
music because of something like who produced it or the worst in my opinion 
is who listened to it.  (Im not saying you do but I know people that do) I 
actually *LIKE* some of that music.  Partially because I heard it so damn 
much and it brings up memories (c&c music factory on the leathal weapon 
pinball machine) and partially cuz its just damn fun/crazy/wierd.

I will not hide my tastes, I love some of the cheeziest shittiest stuff out 
there. Yes, I own the infamous MBOP hanson cd. (If you want a song that 
screams childlike fun and understanding, positive vibe and happyness why 
not revel in a song that was written under these terms?!?!). Yes I own the 
Aqua CD with barbie girl.   I think they are fuckin hilarious.  But then 
this is coming from a guy that listens to  the likes of Pantera, Megadeth, 
Stray Cats, Bon Jovi, Alanis Morissette, Aerosmith, Tchaikovsky, Charlie 
Danniels Band, Primus, Nirvanna, ACDC, Steppenwolf, and (dare I say it) 
ELVIS! and a varietty of other obscure 'tunes'.  I even have country! (well 
ok, country rock).  Not including all of the varios 
techno/house/base/rave/dance/trance/....

When the hell will people learn to listen to what they like and not be 
afraid to standup for it? Learn to show themselves through their music 
tastes, ignore such comments as having bad taste. Make your own damn path!
Rant off.

this list and how we have the c&c tape......also, i was forced to stand 
in line for an hour much earlier this mornin to buy tickets to the 
hanson concert for my mother and sister....and if you want some good 
country, check out jimmy dale gilmoure...hes so rad it hurts...and of 
course, johnny cash.......really anything from the 50's was on a much 
better level than the country-poop of today....big-up mad diversity!

Yeah, that is pretty sick. I guess I just didn't see that. I did
overhear two guys talking while I was cooling off outside the room
with the music. One said to the other as they were going in, "I got

I've just gotta get me a pair of belted up pants with a tucked in
shirt and some wrap-around sunglasses. A funny thing happened to
me while I was in line for the bathroom too. I was just standing
there, kind of dancing in place, when one of the club girls comes
up to me and asks if I'm in line for the bathroom. I tell her, "Yep!"
and keep dancing. Next thing she asks me is, "Do you wanna dance with
me?" I had no idea even how to answer her in the context of a rave.
I mean, if we had been in a club and she had seen me dancing like
that, she would have never asked me to dance. In a rave, there was
simply not going to be a medium ground where we even could dance
with one another. So I just smiled at her and kept dancing. How
do you even go about dancing with someone at a party? I can see
dancing near someone, but too close and there is potential for
bodily injury from knees and elbows...

Yeah, Cleveland promoters could take a lesson from these guys who
manage to find a cool location and dress it up nice and still only
charge $5.

i don't know the system guys from detroit, but i do know JJ from 
untranslatable and JJ is one of the most down to earth guys i've
ever met and far from being shady...he was after all the mastermind
behind the legendary interstellar outback partys...the massive 3 day
outdoor partys similar to family affair, only difference was the
first IO party was FREE, the second a mere $10, and the third $20
(to cover space & sound)...he never made a profit from any of the IO
partys!...talk about doin it outta pure love for the music!!...the reason
he did 'em for free was this was his way of showing appreciation
for all those that had purchased mixed tapes, shirts, drinks, etc.
from his untranslatable booths...in addition scott henry, charles
feelgood, terry mullan, dj dan, dara, and the 2 detroit DJ's are all
personal friends of his and have agreed to play the party for free
...and all the cans of food that will be collected will go toward the
homeless...if that ain't doin it outta love, i don't know what is...

i talked w/ jarred (djthrilla2), part of the untranslatable cru, to make
sure u didn't need reserved tix or anything and he asked JJ and he said
all u need are yur 3 cans of food and proof of out-state ID (driver's
license) and you're in!!!...you really CAN NOT beat that deal, especially
with a stellar line-up of the likes of scott henry, feelgood, dj dan,
terry mullan, & dara!!!

if phorm was any other night me & my friends would definitely have
attended, but call me an old skoolah, but i'm a big fan of JJ's and 
especially his interstellar partys plus 4 of my favorite dj's ever 
will be there for free so...yup the porn cru, the malfunction cru, and
the collective intelligence cru, and a few of my cleveland friends
will be hookin up for cedar point and then fuckthesystem...

what what?
dancing with people at parties is much fun. of course, the way I'm 
thinking is more the breaker/battle style, but still, I love that. (I'm 
just getting more of my friends to take up a challenge too...)

but I have had that strange experience of being asked to dance by 
someone (like, the dancing w/ ravekids just happens. no words 
necessary). I was at this frat (my friend sushi.k was spinning & we were 
representing) and some fratboy asked me to dance. so like I danced w/ 
him for a while (he was probably disappointed about the lack of 
grinding) and then wandered away to talk to my friend (but it was mixed, 
so it's not like the song was gonna end...) poor boy was probably real 
confused...

Hey whats up.  I'm going down for EASY.  I'm from DC and have places where
people can crash if they'd like to go.  I was thinking of renting a Van, or
just driving down.  I can get places for 16 people to crash.  We could make a
whole weekend of it.  We could hit BuzZ on friday, deeP and hit Georgetown and
the record stores on Saturday.  I really hope that some of you consider going
down.  L' Dopah throws wicked parties!!!  It doesn't matter if its a house
party or a full blown production like this.  Weekend road trips like this are
sOooOo much fun.  If you haven't heard of some of the DC local talent, prepare
to be blown away!!  The muthas are B2theA2theD...heeeheee.  Well I'll be at
PHORM this weekend at the net meet.  Hope to see ya'll there on saturday.  

Moze

Alright kids, it's getting nearer....I'm going to start compiling a list of
kids that will be at Sensual here in Cincy. Anyone that's going...drop me a
line and lemme know. I hope as many of you that can make it do, as this is my
21st birthday party! Whoo-hoo! It's gonna be great and you can all help me
celebrate :)

But now here's the big question...where is everyone going later in the
weekend? I think I just might be stuck. I had wanted to drive to Chicago for
their Sunday night party, but my boyfriend has since put his foot down and
said that's too long of a drive for someone who can't do any narcotics that
weekend :) I have heard word that there is going ot be something small in
Columbus that night (?) anyone know of anything else around besides Cleveland.
Damn...if only I could make it to DC...  ;)

BtW...sorry I missed the net-meet at Crystalized...the one time I actually
make it up to a party that kids are gonna meet at, I didn't make it INTO the
party until too late. We didn't get there until 1:30, and the drive up from
Cincy was forever long (we had to go through Dayton first, then through Col.,
and finally on the way to Cleve). Quite a splendid time was had by me and my
kids though...after all I got to see my Max-baby :) Maybe next time....maybe
at Sensual :)

I'm about to leave for the Phish show at Star Lake outside of Pittsburgh. 
Before I got into raves in 1994, I used to be a Deadhead (12 shows in
California, Ohio, Indiana, ect).  Hopefully, this concert will have the
same vibe as the Dead shows used to in the late 80's and early 90's.  I'm
excited -- but don't worry, I'm still a raver at heart.  Techno and trance
are much better imho.  Nevertheless, 20,000 mostly cool people is quite a
scene.  Maybe I'll catch some of you Pittsburgh types in the parking lot
(Tom Cox?  Geekboy?  Geoff?)

Well kids (aren't we all that - kids),

This is my final post on the list (from a temporarty e-mail address as well).
It was fun being on the list, going to some parties in this area over the last
3 years and meeting some of you!

I would also like to thank everyone who supported pHryL. for our US adventures
at Sub Phunc 27 and Phunktion, as well as the brave ones who made it to some
of our Toronto events!

On Saturday night, Aug 15, in Cleveland, pHryL. (and me indirectly) says it's
farewell to the area with the third in the series of PH events in America -
PHORM. After collaborating with House of Styles and Shortarm, this event is
done in conjunction with Teknova. We believe that these 3 crews respesent what
we are interested in, and are closely compatible to us (no disrespect to any
other promoters in the area). They have also had some great talent brought in
the region in the past, and we were happy to have worked with all of them!   

For PHORM you can expect all the good things that are usually present at
pHryL. affiliated events. The only thing we ask you to provide is lots of
horns, whistles, lighters and NOISE for the jungle room in order to show the
UK jungle possee that Toronto is not the only place where the "roof gets blown
off" the bulding. In their maiden midwest appearance, the Formation guys are
going to deliver all their know how. The rest is up to you. Show your
appreciation for the DJ and ask for lots of REWINDs and SELECTAs. They'll be
more than willing to provide them for your pleasure. 

We would also like to inform you that the second set by Detroit's Punisher
(4:30-6) in the third room will be entirely Gabber and Rotterdam based. We
felt that expanding the music variety a bit would please few more of you.
She's still set to play a second room techno set, as originally anounced, wich
will consist of turntables, effects and a drum machine!

The doors for the event will open at 9:45, and the first DJ goes on at 10 pm. 
The slightly altered line-up is as follows:

Room 1:

10-12     Sleepy C
12-1:30  Dieselboy
1:30-3    Shy FX  - Warren G MCing the 1;30-6 time slot!
3-4:30    DJ SS
4:30-6    John B
6-8         Barada and Christian Smith (house tag-team)

Room 2:

10:30-12   DJ^2 
12-1         Free Bass
1-2:30      Locutus  
2:30-4      Punisher (semi-LIVE)
4-5:30      Christian Smith and Barada (techno tag team)
5:30-7:30  7-Up

Room 3:

11-2    Rob Morley
2-3      Pure (live) 
3-4:30  Point Alpha (live)
4:30-6  Punisher (gabber)
6-8      Circuitry (live)

If there is substantial amount of people left, the event may go little longer.
It's all utpto you guys. Make the most out of it for yourself and your
friends! 

Once again, a sincere THANK YOU from pHryL.

Stay tuned for the likes of Adam Beyer, Christian Smith, Joel Mull, Surgeon,
Claude Young, Jay Denham (lot's more of house and d'n'b - mostly from Europe
will be there too) appearing at our anniversary event in Toronto on Saturday,
November 28! 

As always, all the updates, suggestions, comments, reviews and the latest info
can be obtained at

www.phryl.com


A final CIAO!
Viktor

     well, i'm a raver boy, on drugs, and i, uh, don't
     wanna have sex with anyone... right. well, maybe if
     you ask nicely.

     :P

     um, a bunch of my friends are members of fraternities.
     and yes, they can be obnoxious, yes, they do get 
     drunk, and yes, they are still my friends. but i find
     myself connecting with them far less recently. they
     are far from stereotypical, but they _are_ frat boys.
     it's weird. i don't want them coming to raves, not
     because they're evil, but because they don't understand.

     i wear big pants (at parties) and i do non-hardcore drugs
     in fairly responsible quantities. i dress expensively. i 
     don't dance like everyone else. i'm a bass freak. i have
     two jobs and do freelance technical consulting. i go to 
     as many parties as possible in any given time. i listen to
     vangelis and grieg and neil young.

     i AM a "raver", and don't try to tell me otherwise.

     and i'd love to be stereotyped but i think you'd agree that
     100 clones of me might be a damn scary sight. :P

> this

     yeah well - from the 'raver boy' standpoint i think i have
     confused some people at clubs, and i don't really care...

     gotta agree with you. but why did you join a fraternity
     in the first place? it seems to be an invitation to mold 
     yourself. i'm rather pissed at what it has done to some
     of my friends. but i'd be more that happy to be your 
     friend, anyway :] 

     um, i think there _are_ people who are stupid, evil, and
     selfish, not by nature but because that's what they choose 
     to be. humanity in itself is not a redeeming quality, unless
     you're some deity, and i won't get into that.

     but i'm perfectly happy to give people the benefit of the 
     doubt. :)

> sorry.. just had to get that off my chest.. it wasn't specifically
> directed at erica, it just happened to be her post that set me off..
> 
     i can understand why you'd be defensive. but don't try 
     to tell me that the "fratboy" stereotype is undeserved.
     neither is the "raver" stereotype, for that matter. i hate
     stereotypes, but have never been particularly afraid of
     them. you shouldn't have to be either...

     i am a geek who dreams in perl and C, who thinks that
     parallel processing is painfully sexy. i also have bleached
     hair, a two-seater sports car that i drive much too fast, 
     and a penchant for mind-altering substances and cute girls
     in tank tops. i speak german fluently. i would join a 
     fraternity but i can't think of a reason to.

     for me, raves aren't about some vague PLUR, but about
     discovering myself and making many wonderful friends.
     sure, the atmosphere can be great, but people are people
     and we are all fallible.

     HUGS

well tell them, try to explain what it's all about..  i'm sure they can
at least comprehend the spirit of a rave, if not agree with it or feel
it themselves..

believe me, i'm not trying to tell you you're not a raver...  i'm saying
that the stereotypical raver (at least as far as your average american
thinks) doens't work 2 jobs and do freelance consulting...  in other
words, being a part of the rave scene and leading a fairly normal,
upstanding life outside of a rave.

it isn't an invitation to mold yourself..  some people think it is..  i
see a lot of common characteristics with people in my house, but it
doesn't mean we're all from the same mold..  we all dress, talk, walk,
act, and think differently, we just share a friendship because we do
have some things in common, just as you feel a kinship to people on this
list because you share some things in common with them..   it could be
said that being a raver is an invitation to a common mold: big pants,
drugs, crazy dancing, late nights..  it isn't though, because while
ravers share some general characteristics, they are by no means the
same..

true enough, but i just don't like seeing them thrown around with such
disregard for what you're saying..  nobody likes being pigeon-holed with
a bunch of other people becuase they have one or two things in common.. 
especially because stereotypes are typically the negative aspect of a
group, very rarely a positive...  no one thinks of a "fratboy" as
someone who gives back to the community through service projects and
volunteer work, just as no one thinks of a "raver" as a kind and loving
person..  stereotypes only show the negatives..

as far as the whole geek thing goes, i'm a geek, too..  i'm a computer
science major, double majoring in electrical and computer engineering.. 
that would usually disqualify me as a typical "fratboy", while being a
"fratboy" would normally disqualify as a geek...  i don't think ANYONE
fits wholly in any one category, but are always a mix of many things.. i
don't think there exists your typical "fratboy", "raver", or "geek"...  
these stereotypes are too shallowly drawn to hold up in anything but our
imagination and our movies..  ;)

i also know that stereotypes are impossible to avoid, but i think that
they should not be perpetuated...  everyone comes up with an initial
impression when they meet someone, because that person is wearing greek
letters across their chest, phat-ass pants, or coke-bottle glasses.. 
the thing we have to do is get to know that person, not assume anything
about them..

i was gonna say that that was my 2 cents, but it's more like a couple of
dollars, oh well!  ;)

i'll end this whole thing with a quote i'm quite fond of:
"In complete darkness, we are all the same.  It is only our knowledge and
wisdom that separates us.  Don't let your eyes deceve you."

it's from a song called 'In Complete Darkness' off a Happy Hardcore
compilation i have... it's very true...

What the fuck is a "SELECTA" :) ? !

Is that as in, "SELECTA, SELECTA, PULL BACK AND COME AGAIN!"  or what?
 Isn't that the same as a rewind?

     *slap*

     <cough>

     perl is a scripting language most commonly used to extend
     the functions of web servers. it is sickeningly free-form
     and yet amazingly powerful (like you care). C is, well, C.
     ansi C. a programming language. yeah. bell labs, y'know?
     they came up with it. it sucks, pretty much, but java sux
     worse. uh...

     parallel processing is what happens when you make multiple
     computer processors sing and dance in tandem. sorta like a
     rave, more than one person. you know, bigger parties are more 
     fun, whatever. blah.... they also cost more. (!?)
 
     i'm really having a bad day here. excuse the dumb sarcasm.

     yesterday my car dropped its clutch, effectively 
     immobilizing me. today i find out that it will cost $600 
     to fix it. despite the fact that this is straight up 
     bullshit (i'm completely convinced the the actuator arm
     sheared, and i don't think the entire clutch assembly
     needs replacing, oh no thankyou) it means that i have to
     part out my car. rx7 bits, anyone? a nice rotary engine
     for your lawnmower? pop-up headlights for your son to
     play with? alloy wheels for lawn decorations?

     damn. i really liked that car. now i've gotta find
     another one. oh bollocks.

>anything about them..

people identify with a group by the clothes that they wear. whether this 
is a conscious decision is less the issue than the way they are 
perceived by other people because of how they look. I think girls learn 
this fact a lot sooner than boys, in fact, we're told that we can become 
whatever with the right clothes/makeup/etc. now this is not usually a 
positive thing what with all the stereotypes about how women should 
look, but I have benefitted from the knowledge that I am treated 
different depending on how I look. I don't go shopping for work clothes 
wearing big pants and I don't wear business casual to a party. I look 
back at hs photos and crings, because I have changed in many ways and it 
is reflected by the way I look. anyway, I guess my point is that we do 
have control over the image we project (impression management) & in many 
ways can influence people's initial impressions of us. so really it 
isn't quite as shallow as you might think to judge people by the way 
that they dress (generalize), but it is harmful if you think that there 
is nothing more to a person than the characteristics of a stereotype 
(prejudice). anyway, I think that anyone who says that they never 
stereotype is just wrong. generalizations are one of the ways that 
humans cope with abundant sensory information & it is a natural trait. 
however, if one is aware of it, it becomes a tool rather than a problem. 
anyway, I think everyone should try manipulating their image sometime- 
try wearing an outfit that isn't your usual style and then going to say, 
a mall and see how people react. you might be suprised.

okay i think i mentioned something about "confused meatheads with their
miniskirt-clad dates at the bar" after i saw robert delagaulthier at trilogy
so i just want to say that even tho i notice ppl like this, i don't mind them
at all.  i want them to enjoy the party as much as everyone else.  i honestly
wouldn't mind the whole sig ep house any more than a dentist's office staff.
if that's how they want to spend a night out, then ... right on!

also ... i ask ppl to dance with me.  less as courtship, more as fun.  i just
think it's enjoyable to have "someone" (or a group of ppl) you are dancing
"with" ... you can play dancing games with each other ... :)

love and rockets -
david

If you ever want to see something funny read the warning that Microsoft 
gives when installing WinNT4.0 on a pc for java support.  Supposedly 
death can be caused by the product.

Too many geeks around...(oops, me too). Perl and C are programming
languages for computers. Parallel processing is a way of splitting
a computing task between multiple processors.

think in this case, it should be posted again.)

______________________________________________________________________

Usually when you buy E you're going to get one of three things: MDMA, 
MDA, or MDEA.  (If you're really unlucky, it is also possible that you 
might get something that is not any of these, like K, DXM, or 
amphetamine  -- but as a general rule, you're going to get one of those 
first three chemicals).

Here are the descriptions of each separate enactogen (feel-good drugs in 
the methylene-dioxy group -- MDMA, MDA, and MDEA).  Note that each one 
applies to a relatively strong dose:

MDMA: Real ecstasy.  Duration 3-5 hours, depending on dosage.  
Speedy; you feel like you love everyone, no cares in the world; the air 
moving around you feels great; dancing feels great; you have great 
coordination -- you feel basically the best you can possibly feel.  This 
is what everyone *wants* to get.

MDA: Duration 6-8 hours, although after-effects can last up to a day  
for some people.  Less lovey feelings than MDMA, and slightly more 
"stoned- feeling."  Still nice, though.  *Very* talkative, more so than 
MDMA.  (I also consider this to be the only true aphrodisiac, but that 
might be just me).  Slight visuals -- sometimes people mistake this for 
"E cut with mescaline or acid."  If you close your eyes, you might see 
patterns, and it's easy to visualize various shapes when you look at, 
say, clouds or trees. 

MDE: Duration 2-3 hours.  Many people experience slight to severe 
nausea, depending on dosage.  This is what many people think is "smacky 
E," since the effects are the most unlike MDMA.  Not speedy at all, 
actually quite 'stoned' feeling.  Eye wiggles and teeth grinding are the 
norm (although this can happen on any of the three chemicals).  On MDE, 
some people feel unmotivated, but still pretty nice -- you may want to 
sit and observe your surroundings rather than get up and dance.  This 
seems to be the most common substance sold as "E" right now, and I get 
this over half the time I buy in the Pb-Cle area.  One explanation I 
have heard as to why it is so common, that sounds semi-believable, is 
that MDE *may not* be scheduled yet, meaning if you're a chemist, it 
might be safer for you to be making this than the other two.  (Although 
I don't entirely buy this, since there is a law specifically against 
making designer drugs).

Now, the really important part of this whole thing ...

THE PRICE STRUCTURE/POTENCY ARGUMENT AGAINST HEROIN-LACED ECSTASY:
(not written by me)

First of all, heroin is about 4x less effective taken orally than smoked 
or snorted.  Secondly heroin comes in two forms, one is white ("china 
white") and one is tar ("brown tar").  White is more highly refined 
heroin, while the tar is less potent and contains many impurities.  Tar 
is about 4x less potent than white, while white tends to cost about 4x 
as much.  Availability and price of heroin will depend on locale.  On 
the west coast of the USA, white is fairly hard to find, while tar tends 
to predominate and tends to be around $100/gm of tar.  For a heroin 
neophyte the lowest active dose of heroin when smoked would probably be 
around 100mg.  A more usual dose for a more regular user would be 250mg, 
while junkies could use
substantially more than that.  Taken orally, a person would need to take 
about 400mg of tar to be able to feel it and this would cost around $40.  
Now, two important points about this are the cost and the amount.  Most 
important for tar heroin is the amount.  You simply don't generally see 
E pills which weigh upwards of 500mg, which is what would be required in 
order to get a pill with an active quantity of tar in them.  Since most 
E pills don't even weigh much more than 200mg, filler included, there's 
no way that you could possibly get an active amount of tar heroin in 
them.  To emphasize an important point:  EVEN IF THOSE BROWN FLAKES IN 
YOUR E WERE HEROIN, THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD FEEL IT.  40mg of tar is 
going to be 1/10th of an active dose.  Now, even with west coast (USA) 
china white, the cost of a single oral dose of white is going to be 
around $40.  At this price it is going to cost more than the E that 
you're trying to 'cut' it with and it makes much more sense to sell it 
at a higher profit to a junkie, who will come back to you for more and 
be a consistant customer.  It is theoretically possible to sell white as 
E since it's only about 100mg per effective oral dose, but doing this 
will be completely ineffective at getting people hooked on your stuff.  
It makes much more sense to sell heroin users heroin if you're looking 
to create a market.  It has been reported that on the East coast (USA) 
white is substantially more prevalent and cheaper, running more like 
$200/gm or $20 for 100mg.  This is still as expensive as E, and it's 
unlikely that anyone would attempt to 'cut' their E with this -- it 
would probably make for a batch of pills that were weakly E and very 
weakly heroin, or else you'd have to put enough E or heroin into it to 
get the user off of one or the other by itself and then add the cost of 
the other drug on top of it -- making for some fairly expensive pills, 
and a much better profit to be made by just selling the heroin as 
heroin.  Concievably heroin could be pressed into pills by itself and 
sold at raves as E, but again the dealer can do better by selling heroin 
to heroin users.ANALYSIS OF LAB SAMPLES OF MDMA
{mostly just www.ecstasy.org...  needs to be filled in}

ACTUAL ACCOUNTS OF "HEROIN-LACED ECSTASY"
One real-life account of actual heroin laced ecstasy has been passed on 
to me by a source that I tend to belive is reliable.  The story that was 
related to me was that a rave promoter in the Seattle area, circa 1992, 
was lacing their E with heroin.  What they were doing was cutting their 
E at a rate of about 100mg of white heroin to 1/8th of an ounce (3.5gm) 
of E.  This is about 1 effective oral dose of heroin per 35 doses of E.  
It increased to price of the MDMA by about $1 a pill, but the actual 
amount of heroin in the E was barely a trace.  The rationale that the 
rave promoter used was in fact that they were trying to get people 
'hooked' on their E.  Of course, this is as effective as attempting to 
get hooked on cocaine by snorting the 
residue which is present on most of the $20 bills that have been in
circulation.  This was just a waste of some perfectly good china white.  
Another story was related by davey@vii.com on alt.rave, where he claims 
to have had a sample of MDMA tested which turned up as having contained 
heroin in them.  This happened in 1995 and he described it as:
  ``The pill I purchased was in fact a wafer and quite large.  For a 
pressed tab it would have easily have been 650mg or more.  Most people 
taking them in the Portland scene back then were cutting them in half or 
even quarters to take.  Many of the ravers there were regular heroin 
users that claimed the simularities of the effect.'' 
<6jt0j4$ru$1@nnrp1.dejanews.com>

Notice that the pill was *HUGE*.  While davey didn't retain the sample
analysis, this seems somewhat believable as the appearance of the pill 
is highly atypical.  It's strange enough to be true.  The moral of this 
story is not to take drugs that *look* whack.  E pills should be 
150-200mg or so, not 650mg monsters.  Similarly, if you're taking 
*small* pills and still getting off, you aren't taking MDMA.These 
accounts are rare and unusual.

"REAL-LIFE" REPORTS OF "SMACKY E's" WHICH AREN'T.
Many people report having taken "Smacky E."  Under most every 
circumstance it turns out that these people describe effects that could 
easily be accounted for by another drug other than heroin.  Users 
commonly report that they "didn't have the energy to dance" probably due 
to having taken MDEA instead of MDMA.  Some people might get a low dose 
of ketamine and mistake the spacey/dreamy feeling of Ketamine for 
Heroin.  Some people mistakenly attribute normal effects of MDMA to 
being Heroin.  MDMA causes nausea, vomiting and jaw grinding (and higher 
doses or snorting the MDMA may cause increased side-effects), while 
these side-effects are sometimes attributed incorrectly to heroin.  
Nausea, in particular, is a common
side effect of serotonergic drugs (e.g. MDMA, Prozac, LSD, Mescaline) 
and increased doses or faster routes of adminstration (snorting) may 
increase them, along with various other factors (e.g. what you ate prior 
to dosing, how comfortable you feel, and the phase of the moon).
These accounts of "smacky E" are common and almost universally mistaken.

Rolls Royce tabs contain MDE(not heroin). MDE is not addictive. MDE 
is not nearly as fun as MDMA (or MDA for that matter). MDE makes you
feel stoned. MDE gives you 'eye lag'. MDE makes you want to puke
when you drink water. MDE tastes just like MDMA. MDE gives you
very vivid dreams for 2 or 3 days after taking it. MDE makes
you even less hungry than MDMA the next day. MDE manufacturers
should not bother, when MDMA is just as easy. MDE and MDMA are
both contained in Mitsubishis (just an educated guess). MDE makes
it hard to walk through a crowded room. MDE makes you want to
sit in one spot and do nothing for an hour and a half (if you take
too much).

At this particular party, the 'meatheads' lived up to the stereotype
by being racist and starting a fight. I'm just glad I didn't see
it. I've been raving pretty regular for a year now, and have yet
to witness a fight. It's disgusting that anyone would come to a
rave and even think about starting shit.

i agree that C is the god..  but i am not a fan of Java.. it is just
like programming in C with your hands tied behind your back..  no
pointers?  c'mon.. what's up wit dat?  C has got to be the nicest

Well, if your description of MDE is correct, then Rolls Royces do not
containt MDE.  A friend of mine took a RR and had a great time, and
did not experience any of the symptoms you said.  He felt that it was
a very good roll and very clean.

Very true, but from my point of view, rather than "judging" somebody
by what they wear, it is more of a precursor to getting to know them. 
You see the way somebody is dressed and it kind of gives you a quick
peak into what they are like . . . but by no means gives you the right
to "judge" them, only create an interest in further "investigation",

Again, true.  I think much of the problems come from not realizing
you're stereotyping and taking that image too seriously and concretely.

This is definitely a confusing topic.  Some of my observations:
learning to dance at raves has caused me to have a almost complete
inability to dance in a non-rave manner, let alone dance with other
people in a non rave manner.  On the other hand I can, and thoroughly
enjoy dancing with people at raves.

In general there are three ways to dance w/ people at raves.  
1) the way that the "bathroom" guy was dancing with the girl . . . not
really dancing with her, just standing near her and kind of dancing.
2) actually dancing with the person, like arms intertwined etc.  this
is best done to some sort of steady beat music . . . esp trance, but
house or anything else similar works too.  def. more of a sexual dance
than the other two.  you actually touch the person you are dancing
with! ;)
3) breaker/battle style . . . this involves somewhat of a competition
spin on it, but at the same time is really just both people having a
lot of fun.  sometimes both people dance aggresively at the same time,
sometimes they takes turns, but regardless adreniline is rapidly built
up.

As far as I'm concerned any of these are a lot of fun and def. change
up dancing by yourself, but 2 and 3 are no doubt the most exciting. 
For me, the better the dancer the person you are dancing with is, the
more fun it is.

I found the Rolls Royces to be a great experience, the second best I've had so
far.  Some called Angels were by far the most intense.

man... there were a lot of list folkz @ scj last nite. it was like a
giant netmeet :)

the music was pretty gosh-darn good... brent grenda suprised us all
and spun a pretty decent set of hard d+b... sine rolled it out nicely,
i enjoyed this set more than most of his others. things really started
to heat up @ the end of his set, when the bass really started to roll
+ the beats got a littl emore interesting. then came dieselboy.
believe it or not, his set was tight-as-fuck. very hard w/ driving
simple beats and acid/acidbass stabs galore. a nice bit of the
hardsteppy variety as well. i got to witness the last 1/2 hour of his
mixing skillz up in the dj box (cause i'm vip like dat :), where i
recieved a small stack of promo house records, and was offered various
alcoholic drinks by the friendly s.c.j. staff (sine: "you want a
bottle of beer?" me: "no thanks" sine: "you want a draft beer?" me:
"no... i'm cool" *15 second pause* sine: "would you like a mixed
drink?" :) :)

brent grenda + his metromix buddies gave out boxes of cds + posters. i
got hardhoptrickedout by omar santana and it's pretty damn good. what
did everyone else get?

nick bulletproof + jay(alaska) were gettin all kinds of funky on the
dancefloor, bumpin' + grindin like there was no tomorrow :)  i can't
even tell you how many pictures i saw being taken of nick booty dancin
with various people...

got a flyer for "exposure"... being thrown by DNF (dj^2 and his wife
shannon) doran, tommie sunshine, josh ryan, bee dee, tr gen, dj^2....
sept 25. looks promising. >>secret dl info: if all goes well with this
rave, they are gona throw a larger ALL JUNGLE rave. woo hoo!

well - this review was a bit boring, i guess. sorry - i'm tired + @
work.

each day it gets more and more promising that todd + i are gonna be
goin to phorm. as of now our folks are pretty much cool with us
driving to new york to go backpacking! we're pickin up sethCRAZYbaum
from his vacation haus in chataqua and headin off to phorm from there.
we're all insanely excited...

dat's it

geez - is this an incomplete list or what? you left out some of my
favorites

4) 2 or more people dancing like gimps, tryin to see who can do the
stupidest dance
5) booty grindin (a la nick + jay @ s.c.j.)
6) the chill variation of 2) where you dont actually touch the person
you are dancin with.
7) all out boxing/kung fu fighting matches with referees + shit :)
...if you are ever @ a rave and a song comes on with a old chinese
martial arts movie sample, you best be throwin up blocks, cause i'm
bustin out with ninja styles on yo ass :)
8) line dancing
9) variation on 3 w/ glowsticks

damn - there are a whole bunch more, but i'm gonna stop now anyways

Oh, I should have said that I got the Rolls I was talking about at
Sproutin', and they were small yellow pressed pills with a 'RR' on
one side. Also note that the same press can be used for different
tabs, so the actual content can vary week to week.

Hey -- some people love the stuff.  And a smaller dose can be *pretty* 
fun.  What I consider to be the "bad side effects" increase with dose.
However, Both Erik (whose post you replied to) and I MUCH prefer the 
speedy lovey-ness of MDMA.  

Now, Erik mentioned that he thinks the "mitsubishis" which are starting 
to go around are an MDE/MDMA mix.  I will agree with this, but must 
mention that I found the MDMA content to be predominant.  The only 
reason we suspect it may have been cut with MDE is the spacey/stoned 
sort-of feeling we experienced druing the first hour.  Since MDE is 
shorter lasting than MDMA, this would make sense.  These are very fun 
rolls, though -- and I would recommend them to anyone.

--Amanda

Yep, yep, what frankie-g said was completely true.  SCJ rocked
hardcore.  As somebody said, "There are so many party kids here." 
Which was def. an unusual and very nice change.

Very good vibe going on in general.  I wish SCJ could be like that
every week.  The danceflor crews were going nuts, with the most
dancing at SC in a long time.  Brent Grenda, tore it up prety good,
with ncie dark selection.  Then Sine came on, moving away from his
recent afro-funk tip, and rollin hard and dark.  Then dieselboy came
on and tore the spot up.  Great selection, all futuristic tip, with
steppin' beats and bass stabs galore.

Big up all the pb-cle massive in the place: xspyboy, spike, tom,
geoff, phatandy, and everyone else.

And a big shout out to geekboy for shakin' yo' booty and generaly
having a blast with me for the last half hour or so :)

piece,

absolut

ps-two week:troll, mogli, and sine . . . oh yeah.

     no, no e is laced with heroin, and if it was it
     wouldn't do much. your average rolls-royce is
     just slightly cut or impure mdea. quite nice,
     actually, but hardly earthshaking.

     shut up. i program in lisp. tell me i'm evil.
     java is the hell-spawn of a buzzword-addicted
     marketing industry, and has been responsible for
     millions of suicides since it's introduction.

     now lets all talk about raves, ok? we can take

oh yeah..  cybersex..  i never really understood that one...  what is
the point..  it is painfully difficult to masturbate and type at the
same time..  i find it pointless..  gotta love off-topic posts...  and
it doesn't get more off topic than this!

    well, total net-meet at SCJ last night.
    shouts to trouty, andy the pooh, caracutie,
    xspyboy, the PBS massive (tom/geoff/et al)
    absolut (brushing up on my jungle dance 
    skillz) frankie g, benny haha (shame on you
    for not coming up and saying hi :) don the
    soundmeister, spike, liquid (happy birfday
    baby) and any others that i don't recall at
    this point.

    totally tight set by dieselboy, too fast for
    me (still recovering from a wicked weekend) to
    dance to for very long. note of interest - 
    somebody threw on some goofy booty-bouncing
    ghetto house when the place was being shut down,
    and i just couldn't sit still. it's my curse to
    be a house-head in a jungle city :]

    mad ups to the people throwing the party on 
    the 25th of next month, (dj2 + his wife, and
    sessions from what i can tell) for being so
    wonderfully willing to work with anybody. i just
    can't say how much that attitude means to me.
    infighting will kill the scene if we let it, and
    will certainly stop it from growing the way it
    should. 

    on a similar note, i have to express my gratitude
    to all the people in the scene (downlow/pbs/hos
    for starters) who have befriended me and ignored
    my (rapidly-diminishing) semi-outsider status.

    also all the other kidz in the scene, you know
    who you are, who have totally accepted this geek
    from england. luv ya all (in various ways :)

    hugs, and see you all at atomic or phorm and of
    course at the next SCJ. god my feet hurt. :P

     i am perfectly happy making fun of my german

     had to flee germany due to religious persecution,

Hi!

        Well, I had a great time in MD teaching math to kids.  I didn't get
to any parties, or even buzz, but I've decided to keep raving.  Anyway, I'm
still probably not going out to pittsburgh this summer, but if any of you
are out east this weekend or in maryland for cybernature, I'll tell you what
I'm wearing so you can get free coffee/water/luv.  But what bothers me is
that about half of the new messages I got upon resubbing were drug-related.
I'm not straightedge, but geez, how about some music-related stuff?  Being
too cheap to buy CDs or records, I've been listening to netradio and the
BBC, and I've heard this new sound called futura nova, some of which was
from japan.  Can anyone recommend any good artists that make this stuff?
The only one I remember was Luminescent Orange.  Does anyone spin this?  Has
anyone added beats to make it danceable?  That's about all for now, and I
hope to see some of you this fall!

                                                peace,

                                                Jim

OK, all this talk about MDE and MDA and MDMA and MAMA, leads me to the

does anybody know what is in molecules? (no not in your body :)

No, Tom there were lines . . . you just didn't happen to be standing
in one.  The lines were really long because they were looking through
every cigarette carton for shady shit, and there were two rooms so
people were going back and forth a bunch.

Me and 2 friends took Rolls Royces at Sproutin' and had a lovely, dreamy 
time. We reckon it was a mix of MDMA and MDA. 

Makes you horny as hell, though...  ;)

damn.

some of y'all gotta grab me next time, i know about half of you, it'd be
good to meet the rest...i'm gonna be spazzing way too hard to be coherent
this saturday, so i dont have high hopes for the net meet at that one :)

but todd, i think its a decent idea to have the meet right up front...like
someone said about the robert de la gauthier show, there was a bunch of
netters brockin out up front...why not again.

scj was dope last nite, word. :)

and if anyone knows who the blond visor cuties were, let me know ;)

peace,

Any idea if this party will actually bring in all the headliners? From what
I've heard CBS doesn't always bring in all the headliners and paying $30 for
a couple locals just wouldn't be worth it....

are you talking about the gel capsules?

if you are, i would guess MDA (based on 3 seperate occassions)...it
lasts a long time (about 7 hours),  a little dopey, makes you
talkative...

on a related note...taking the gel capsule molecules with a lime turns
you into a drooling idiot...among many other things, you'll set your
pants on fire, you'll think you're smoking when the cigerette is
actually unlit (or even worse, you're not even holding a cigerette),
you'll attempt to light your cigerettes with a blow pop, you'll
constantly  put the cigerette in your mouth the wrong way (trying to
light the filter)...basically you end up being hilariously pathetic
entertainment for your friends...not that i would know personally, it's
just what i've heard...hehe   :P

I've been wanting to say this for a long time, and on the ever growing
wave right before the peak of the summer, namely, Phorm, I feel it's an
apt moment . . .

And it goes a something like this:

I've met more *outstanding* people on this list in the past 6 months than
I've met while living in Cleveland in the past 6 years.  This has been a
ripe summer, chock full of life moments and engraved memories -- but none
of it would have had the same enrapturing glaze if not for the people
involved.  And for me, most of these people I've met through this forum. 

Thanks!

Braden

celebrating Steve Ford's (DaPwezz's) entrance into real geriatric-dom (his
birthday!!) Steve will turn 31 tomorrow (Thursday, August 13th)...that's
right, his birthday this year will be a palindrome (anyone know what that
means?? Let's just say: 31 on the 13th. 
We will start this evening at the Gyro in Kent and move onward to the Cosmic
Cow in Akron for an all night afterhours of some of my best friends (we wont
mention any specific names, but there will be some great surprises!) spinnin
phat mad sets. (doors lock shut @ 2:30am and we rave 'til dawn.) 

There is no admission to this "event", just come down and wish Steve a happy
birthday tonight... Questions? Call Steve or the Cosmic Cow. See ya there!!!

	Actually, that was just a downtempo number Damian wanted to

hehe....at SCJ last night, geekboy(henry) and i came to the realization
that after you listen to "techno" music for a while, everything that you
listen to, regardless weather it's "techno" or not, turns into a potential
remix.  it cracks me the fuck up......anybody else suffer from this?

Subject: crystalized 2 review (short and sweet)


okay, i think i am the only person that didn't have a good time at this
party...but i think it had to do with more personal factors then anything
else.  and it wasnt' the heat...if you can edure the summer you can endure
the heat, and well...buttfuck ohio was never said to be the coolest (temp.
wise) place in the world. 

So, as those of you who know me know, i don't do drugz at parties, it's a
personal preference that i have upheld these long 2 and 1/2 years as a
"party kid."  As those of you also know i always have my sailor moon bag
full of lollipops and other assorted shit to give out at parties...now at
this one, i was left with a feeling that i sort of liken to losing your
soul, perhaps. My bag is still full of shit and candiness just didn't
happen here. I dunno, (pardon the lapse into teenangst, i've only been
20 for a day and well..i keep forgeting :P) maybe that's a bit extreme,
but i felt nothing at this party.  No...check that...sine's set reduced me
to tears and next to Dave Trance's set at Cheer, was one of the most
beautiful things i've ever heard in my life.  And don't get me wrong, the
Chicago House was slammin and i had a bomb time dancing to it, but there
was just this over all "eh" quality to the night. 

But, this is what i think happened.  First of all, why alcohol?  It's a
major dehydrator, and noone in that space should have been drinking.
Aside from the fact that i've never seen alcohol really promote
PLUR...ever.  Second, there was just too much crystal going around...true,
it is rather aprapo for it to be at a  party called Crystalized, but...oh
well...another tagent for another time...needless to say, i HATE crystal!
I have done it and i hate it and i hate what it does to my friends. So i
think these were my major reasons for not liking this party...plus a lot
of personal angstiness that i was dealing with that i'm sure noone here
wants to hear so :P.

anyway, i gotta jet, hope noone was offended, but sorry kidz, i just felt
blah.  Oh...and waiting for two hours for friends to be let out of the
space after the cops came and busted the party SUCKED.  (mad hugz to Don
of WWS for helping us outta that situation :}) oh and to all you kidz i
met who were stranded (if you're on here) i hope you got home safe and
your friendz got out of the "Clampetville" aka Loraine jails.

     uh, quit using my name on the list. in another life i'm
     a straight-edge student organization leader. for real.
     careful with that shit. i mean, sure, most of you know
     my name, but i'd like to keep my posts as frank as 
     they have been. no big deal tho - just keep it in mind.

     um, what was i really going to say? what pooh and me
     were talking about.

     oh yeah. the house i just moved into, one of the guys
     has his record collection from the 60s, all vintage pop,
     and i was going through it, thinking 'damn, this would  
     go good layered over some cruddy breaks' etc.

     then i put on the st. martin in the fields recording of
     peer gynt suite, and the third movement was a version i'd
     never heard before, with like vocals in _danish_ or
     whatever. it was totally slamming, wicked acoustic basses
     and a full choir shouting. mix in a couple kicks and a
     little noise... damn.

     you get the idea. i'm hooked on sonicz. wurked fur meee.

	i wanna say this - anyone who is close to the tour - even if you're

Thanks for your help,

I realize that now I must have been drugged up myself.  I just thought I 
remembered hearing that a rolls royce was bad.  The name made it sound 
that way.  Oh well.  My friend is pretty cool now.  She just isn't 
eating or anything.

I bought a "molecule" at Nocturnal Emission and it was flat-up, 
garden-variety, 4-hour-lasting MDMA (one of the very few times this 
summer I've actually gotten it. grrrr).

I think my point is that you can put ANYTHING in a capsule and call it 
whatever you want.  One batch might have been MDA, one batch something 
else.  I have no doubt that several different pills called molecules 
have been in circulation.

     THANKYOU for that rare bit of common sense
     (not rare for you, but for users in general,
     i mean). what do you think pet names are for,
     the edification of the consumer? drugs hardly
     come with an FDA stamp and a freshness 
     guarantee.

     'oh yeah, i got a bunch of aspirins with the
     bayer stamp rubbed off, i mean, white rabbits,
     straight in from the wilds of borneo. they're
     very pure, with a trace of acetasylic acid, 
     kinda speedy. you'll like them. no nausea'

     yeah whatever. anybody dealing drugs to complete
     strangers was skipped over when they doled out
     the brain cells. what makes you think they can
     be trusted?

     hugs/plur/cheerio

Hell yeah!!  It's soo true.  I've got several ideas like that already,
just waiting for me to get more sample space on my sound card (anyone
know where to get ram for an awe 64 or how much it can hold?).
I'd talk about them, but I don't want anyone stealing my ideas, seen? ;P

massive in the area." :)

hi kids.  no, i'm not getting paid to say this.  it's just an opinion.  the
phryl parties i've been to - subphunk and phunktion - have been excellent.
friendly security, running water, clean bathrooms, all staff and dj's knew
what was going on.  i've also been to trilogy before, and it actually wasn't
hot on the dancefoor!  and the lounges were sofa-padded!  so i'm expecting
another good experience.

the tone of these "concern" posts surprises me.  it sounds to me like amanda
and az particulary just take pills with the intention of "let's see what this
makes me feel like," measuring its color, texture, packaging, stamps, mass ...
then taking notes on their activities, then trying to come to a conclusion as
if they were playing "the price is right."  it's just interesting.  it seems
like you have effectively precluded any placebo effect.  i think i respect
this.

ALSO, and more importantly ... do you kids think it's wrong to assume that two
pills have similar content - perhaps with negligible differences if from
different batches - if they look identical?

 Hey -- some people love the stuff.  And a smaller dose can be *pretty* 
 fun.  What I consider to be the "bad side effects" increase with dose.
 However, Both Erik (whose post you replied to) and I MUCH prefer the 
 speedy lovey-ness of MDMA.  
 
 Now, Erik mentioned that he thinks the "mitsubishis" which are starting 
 to go around are an MDE/MDMA mix.  I will agree with this, but must 
 mention that I found the MDMA content to be predominant.  The only 
 reason we suspect it may have been cut with MDE is the spacey/stoned 
 sort-of feeling we experienced druing the first hour.  Since MDE is 
 shorter lasting than MDMA, this would make sense.  These are very fun 
 rolls, though -- and I would recommend them to anyone.

all this talk about drugs is giving me a weird sense of my place in this
whole scene.  why?  because i've never done any illegal drug in my life.
not even a spliff.

does that make me a prude?  a wannabe preacher?  am i straightedge?  or am
i just scared to experiment?

nope, it's neither of these.  i've just never felt that i needed anything
to enhance myself from the outside.  i know it sounds all-too-corny, but
my highs are generated from within. 

i'm not saying you shouldn't do drugs or experiment with your perceptions,
because a lot of people benefit from it.  but a lot of people don't even
think twice before taking these things into their body, and as we all
know, this can be a very dangerous, and self-destructive path. 
unfortunately, our scene is now almost completely geared towards this
dangerous path, and even the more conemplative reasons for drug use are
only a quaint remnant of a bygone era.

sadder still, a lot of people don't even bother to consider that they
don't really _have_ to do drugs.  they instantly assume you _must_ do
drugs to take part in this culture, and that there are no other ways to be
a part of a social group or to expand your mind. 

so here i am, loudly declaring that IT ISN'T TRUE.  i represent a
different approach.  there are lots of ways you can become part of this
culture, lots of ways to "fit in" that don't involve you risking your
health and mental well-being on some mysterious pills that cost $30 each.

of course, i'm not here to try to change everyone, as much as i might wish
for things to get better.  but i am here to be obvious about who i am.  i
feel i have a responsibility to declare myself as loudly as possible, in
the hope that maybe--just maybe--someone else out there might listen to me
and say: "hey, that guy doesn't use drugs and he's okay...maybe i don't
have to, either..." 

just one option among many.


ps- if this is the first time anyone has ever told you you can be a raver
and NOT do drugs, you need to look for some new friends ;)

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, as well as some somewhat related concert events, just testing
this out and we'll see what the reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

Its kind of funny, I've posted only twice on this list and now I'm 
heading out.  I just wanted to say that meeting up with the few of you 
that I did was very nice and I hope you all have great times this 
weekend.  I'll be packing to move to Philly and money is tight, so no 
fun for me.  To those of you I met take care and the same to those I 
didn't.  Have fun again.

PLUR,
Lou Dee

I know what you are talking about.  I am not so straight but I get these 
AWESOME natural highs. I get them from dancing in general(every one 
always thinks i am on speed), meditating, praying, running(exercising in 
general), and other stuff.  Living it up is a natural high.  But I do 
take stuff occasionally I just like experimenting(to bad it is at the 
cost of my brain).  Although being an artist of some sort it has 
enhanced my creativity.  Unfortunately I will never know if I could've 
done this on my own or not. Oh well.

YOu have my respect
Not everyone should do drugs but if some of you all do already--do it 
moderately and as safely as possible(however that is).
Just my opinion

*Funny* how I totally agree with this.  I was quite militantly straight 
edge for years (wore the sXe's on stuff and everything), and sometimes I 
would get so manic-ly, insanely happy and so full of energy people would 
think I was messed up on something.  I remember when I turned 18 and the 
only place I could get in was Trilogy.  I went on a Sunday night with a 
friend and I danced for hours straight -- where I got the energy, I have 
no idea, but it was there.  (I also remember there were some ravers with 
glowsticks there that night who were making fun of the way people 
danced, and I was afraid to dance near them.  I guess this is a pretty 
damn odd first impression of "ravers.")

I may have changed my personal drug-taking habits, but the philosophy is 
still the same -- it still comes from within -- drugs don't necessarily 
"make" the experience.

Actually, we are always just looking for MDMA. We find a dealer, ask
to taste the stuff. (If they give you shit about tasting it, don't
buy) If it is so bitter you go 'ack!', it's at least not aspirin.
Buy it, and wait. If it feels like MDMA, we stock up so that we will
have some for the next party (or two) without having to look. Sure,
sometimes you will go back and they will be out, but it's better than
spending all of your money on crap.

If it is within a week or two, you can usually assume the pills
are the same. Any longer and all gets are off.

On the subject of natural highs...

If you've taken a fair amount of e, you becomes so conditioned to 
feeling good when the music's pumpin' and the light-show is going
that if you don't take anything at a party and just give yourself to the 
music you CAN feel really high. It's just like Pavlov's dogs I 
suppose...

If you're bummed because your pill didn't work or you couldn't get, 
that's a different story. But if you just decide to go dancing straight 
- it can be good without e - (or perhaps with a small spliff as catalyst 
for the die-hards like me!) You still get that rush and you can still 
trance/trip out if the music's up to scratch.

Just you and the music - your only friend until the end.

Hi all,

Had sub'd to this list to check out what was going on in my old Cleveland and
Canton stomping grounds (was actually in Euclid back when they actually used to
make those monster earth-moving trucks there, back when "The Ghoul" ruled late
night w/e tv (Ron Sweed where are you now?!)... needless to say, I'm an
old-timer!)... thought i might be making a trip back there soon, and thought that I could
get some info... well, the trip fell through, and I'm going to 

unsubscribe

now. Thanks for some interesting thoughts... and if you're ever in the Boston
area, well, let me know... 

Mike

I've got a question for everyone..  There's been a lot of discussion
about drugs lately, some people for them, some against them...   In any
case, I am curious to know various people's reasons for thinking drugs
are bad..

Personally, I think that there are good and bad drugs..  You can tell
which are which by what they do to you...  on the whole, i'm not a fan
of addictive drugs, i like to stick to psychadellics and mind-alterers,
but then again, i get drink frequently and am a smoker..  damn legal
drugs.. of all the substances i've ingested, i firmly believe that the
ones that are the worst for me are the legal ones...  strange, isn't it?
 in any case, i'm curious to hear other people's opinions on why drugs
are bad (or why they aren't)...

Drugs, by their innate definition could just about describe anything. 
When talking about them amongst many people, people tend to skew their
descriptions.  Typically referring to illicit drugs.  The typical
thinking behind a straight edger's mind (not to generalize, though,
sorry) is that if the FDA makes it illegal it is bad.  Some would say
that the FDA are full of it and take it too slowly.  Honestly, they are
slower than most countries' equivalences of the FDA, but taking a look
at those countries, they need medical help much moreso than Americans. 
When talking about drugs, too many facts and what not need to be taken
into consideration.  I admit to taking many types of intoxicants,
actually for quite some time, now I am sober.  As far as I'm concerned I
got the experiences I wanted out of them.  I learned about what feelings
I am capable of and what things I can do.  I didn't do drugs mainly for
this reason, but it was a part of it.  You can take any illicit drug and
analyze why one should try it or not try it.  It then becomes a personal
issue, of which, others' opinions should be freely considered.  The
experienced and knowledgeable user obviously knows more about it.  But
each person IS different and has different personalities, as well as
chemical makeup, which give slightly different effects from drugs.  Ask
any qualified doctor, tis da truth.  But hey, I rambled on enough and
haven't even read most of the emails about what you guys were talking
about.  I just been in too many drug conversations to have a solid
opinion.  PEACE and live the lives meant to be lived.  Sorry if this
sounds like some religous crap...;}

     well, i have my own strange story, i guess.
     i'm not sure that i have [or want] a sense
     of place in the scene or anywhere, but i'm
     just happy to be alive + unique.

     i grew up in a rather repressed and secluded
     environment, intensely religious. that's really
     all i care to say about it, but basically, my
     childhood and it's emotional cues are what is
     responsible for my drug use now.

     it's not in the childish sense of 'making up
     for lost time' or even simple rebellion. i 
     have nothing to rebel against - my past is
     my past and i have left it there - but more
     in a vain and violent attempt to regain a 
     childhood i seemed to have simply skipped.

     i'm not worried about danger - i'm the most
     responsible and informed user i know. i'm not
     afraid of anything - except letting life pass
     me by, not doing or experiencing something 
     because i was told not to, or not making a
     venture because common sense tells me it will
     be wickedly stressful. i can no longer live
     without doing, and without trying something
     you will never know what is truly possible.

     this is why i go to raves. this is why the 
     underground music scene appeals to me.

     i rave, therefore i am alive.


     and drugs are just SOOO much fun! try it, 
     you'll see.

     um, later,
     geekboy

ATTENTION ANYONE WHOSE GONNA BE TAKIN PIX @ PHORM:

i grabbed a stack of mailers for this cheap ass photo place
(mailorder). to get a roll of 24 exp film developed, it is only 59
cents plus 90 cents shipping. i'm gonna bring the stack to phorm so if
anyone wants on, just come up to me + ask. funsaver cameras are the
same price (even the 27 exp ones). 36 exposure film is $2.95, so if
you really wanna save, stick with the 24s.

Personally, I think tobacco is the worst drug. After the first week 
or two(of smoking regularly), the only reason to smoke is to get rid
of the withdrawl symptoms. Really anything that is addictive I 
consider 'bad'. I have to admit, I am a caffeine addict ;-) Mention
LSD to most people and they think it will turn you permanently into
a drooling psychopath who stares at the sun and thinks they are an
orange, that is, if the strychnine doesn't kill you first.

I would say the reason that many people feel that drugs are bad is
simple misinformation. Nobody dies from smoking pot and it's illegal,
while over half a million people a year die from the combined effects
of alcohol and tobacco, which are legal. Most people don't want to
hear this kind of information because they have been fed the same
line of crap for all their lives, and how can it be that ecstasy
kills maybe 6 per 100,000 users while 600 per 100,000 women can
expect to die in childbirth. Withdrawl from alcohol is worse for
your body than withdrawl from heroin. And then there the people who
just believe that anything fun must be wrong. I can't even
comprehend how these people go through life with all of the hedonism
around them! 

Well, there's my little rant.

-Az

Okay, I must have missed this post when it popped up the first time.  So 
here I am replying to the reply.

Az and I will take the "Pepsi challenge" anytime, anywhere -- and be 
able to tell you exactly what's in a particular pill.  We have this 
thing down to a freakin' art, and it's simply because of experience.  I 
know some people are very, very put off by this -- but I'd like to know 
how many of them have been drunk in the last six months.  I sure 
haven't.
(Getting off the subject...)
Anyone care to know what bunk crap we've gotten in the past?
Well, once we got a low dose of ketamine (smacky E, dude!).  Once, we 
got roofies -- which fucked me up for days.  We do our tasting and 
testing thing to make sure this doesn't happen again.  When we find a 
pill that tastes right -- one of us takes it. The other one of us stays 
sober.  When the first person says, "This is good," we'll buy more and 
the other one of us will take one.  This helped save us a lot of money 
at Family Affair -- one of us got some weak MDE, so we didn't buy any 
more from that guy.  When I got some great MDMA -- we stocked up.
While everyone else was rolling on crap at Phunktion (from what I've 
been told), we were enjoying some choice stuff from the week before.

I am planning on ordering an E testing kit sometime in the near future.  
These kits test pills for MDE, MDA, MDMA, 2CB, amphetamine, MBDB, and a 
couple other things.  When I get this bad boy -- it's no more money 
wasted EVER.  

--Amanda

yeah - ben franklin was a bit of a cut-up... we read this list he
wrote in english class called the top ten reasons to marry an older
woman, and number one was that they get old and wrinkly over time
starting from their headz down, so if you put a bread basket over the
top half of your woman in 30 years, you wont be able to tell the
difference while gettin funky

(hey! i didn't say it - ben franklin did!)

Sorry for the cross-post! 'doh!!  =D

Recently, among several of the regional rave lists, there have been
threads dealing with dj names. In addition, now more than ever
before there are many aspiring bedroom DJs out there who look forward to
spinning their first party in the very near future -- and may need a
place to look to see if a DJ name is already in use. A couple of
people have already found this resource to be useful, so I thought that I
would spread the word..

We created a webpage listing all of the dj names we know to exist
(9,744 at the moment) and put it at:

		http://www.ravedata.com/dj/djlist.html

Feel free to link to it directly, or...

If you're not familiar with all that ravedata has to offer, take the "site
tour", one click off of the main page at http://www.ravedata.com

Keep dancin'.

veryveryvery good point. Most ppl live their lives to be successful.  With
success comes money, but that kan onlee get you so far.  If you find something
fun (ie. a drugg) , use it as a pleasure.... but not a way of life.  If it
becomes a way of life, there becomes no escape.  The same goes for partees.

I kno i never post anything (oops) but this was of interest to me and i jus
felt compelled to say something.  anyone drop me line......
(aol=cryolakid,uin=1349201) be safe and keep it real.

This is one sad thing.  While I'm not really interested in drugs, 
the idea of 'mind alteration' was one thing that attracted me to 
the concept of raves.   The ideas of altering perceptions towards some
sort of extra dimensional weirdness, experience and high-tech tribalism -
that we're all basically the same, that there are many layers to
perception and reality. Are these really only ideas from a 'bygone
era'.....to me it seems like yes.  The drug use of the scene is pretty
much for hedonistic pleasure (i'm all for it!)....but even raver-icon-hero
types like Timmy Leary saw that as a pretty low stage in concept (circuit
5, i think - i'm not a big leary fan, but he's an interesting guy).

Am i right about this?  Or do people consider drug taking (theirs or
others) to be truely enlightening or spiritual?  I mean *really*, not
just kinda-sorta.  I dunno really.

On another point....I never really considered this, but its true.

Some people might actually feel that they're not accepted in the rave
scene if they don't do drugs, or the right drugs.  I must speak up with
EdLuna on this one and say that if that's how you feel - you definitely
don't have to. I have no prejudice against kids who 'roll' at every rave,
but alot of us hardcore kids (like 2-3 times out a week) are goin'
straight *EVERY*time and having a ball.  I'm one of em'. :)

i do..   the first time i took acid, i did it with this hippie friend of
mine..  now whenever i dose, it is a very spiritual thing..  i like to
make it a very introspective and mind-expanding (not just mind-altering)
experience..  i've never really thought of lsd as a "party" drug, like
alcohol or pot, or whatever...  it's meaningful to me, and i really
enjoy getting something out of it..  but i may be strange..

i would say that the first-time roll was enlightening and did have a
long lasting positive impact...each roll subsequent to the first one has
been increasingly less so...no matter how intense, recent rolls have
been less memorable than the early ones (in general)...from my
understanding, this is a natural progression to be expected of long term
use...maybe?

Someone asked me to repost this . . . so here it is:

"Crystallized 2" - A College Course Guide
By Braden Albert

Geography:  Although I've pretty much grown up in NE Ohio, this was my
first trip to Lorain.  As I drove there down an enjoyable stretch of 90W,
it occurred to me what a good idea it is to have parties in second tier
cities outside of Cleveland, Pittsburg h and Columbus.  There are plenty
of unique spaces just waiting to be discovered in such places and the
prices are probably lower too.  Plus, it's always fun to venture into a
virgin space.  It really adds to the general appeal of the party. 

Architecture:  The Eagle's Nest had a near perfect layout.  There were two
rooms of music, three chillout areas and a hallway that served as a sixth
room.  As dawn ushered in the morning daylight bliss, I discovered a roof
that was easily accessible from one of the chillouts -- essentially a
seventh room.  To watch the sunrise from this vantage point added a
wonderful touch as well as a great view of the clouds and the surrounding
city.  Although I love skating rinks, the option of hanging out in a
semi-l ight, relatively quiet chillout room allows for friend making and
conversation - which as far as I'm concerned is one of the greatest joys
of going to parties.  This space had it in a big way. 

Economics:  In terms of price, I think everything was just right.  $20 is
a fair fee for a two room party these days - especially with a headliner
like Noel Sanger.  What I was especially proud of was the fact that water
was only $1.  This allowed everyon e to stay fully hydrated without having
to go broke.  When the H2O ran out upstairs, the bartender downstairs even
gave water away for free - a nice gesture, I thought. 

Physical Education:  The wooden floor of the main room was a nice bonus. 
Due to the seductive call of overwhelming and compelling beats, there was
no holding back.  And having a floor like that to dance on all night
allowed for a minimal of Sunday aches and pains.  What also got me going
were the cool psychedelic, moving images displayed on the white screen in
the middle of this room.  I'd like to see more of these mixed, ever
evolving, full color graphics at other parties in the future. 

Social Studies:  What made this event so memorable, besides the above, was
the variety of vibes in each of the many rooms.  It was like changing
social channels every time I left one room and entered another.  The
diversity of the group and the wide array of tunes probably allowed for
this.  Whatever the reason, I found it so very easy at this party to meet
and briefly connect with absolute strangers.  And each time I did so, it
took me a little bit higher. Speaking of which: 

Mathematics:  1 e + 1 e =  5,458 smiles

Music Appreciation:  Although I had a really good time listening to most
of the dj's, the highlight of the show was the singer Nicole who did
soulful things on stage to Noel Sanger's live set that were just goosebump
inducing.  She is absolutely amazing! 

Foreign Language:  I had the pleasure of running into "geekboy" from this
list.  Born in Germany, raised in England and now a native of Pittsburgh,
I had a really excellent time chatting with him.  Henry is anything but a
"geek" and certainly one of the c oolest people I've met in a long while. 
This list seems to be a magnet for outstanding individuals, and the more
we get to know each other, the more meaningful and enjoyable these parties
become.  I also had the pleasure of running into Kate, Lou, Lou D and
Steve Ford.

I suggest to everyone who hasn't already check out the chemistry archives
on www.hyperreal.org.  Especially the on-line book "E is for Ecstasy" by
Nicholas Saunders.  Before trying anything you should defnitley read about
it.Thankfully hyperreal provides the resources.

Several people have e-mailed me in regards to this, and I just want to 
make it clear that I don't have one *yet*.  The few I've seen advertised 
have all been from the U.K., and the going price was around 50 pounds 
for the last one I saw.  The next time I see them advertised I will post 
the information to the list, but in the meantime, I'm kinda still 
looking myself.

The important thing is that they exist at all -- they're getting bigger 
in Europe because the E scene over there is far more prevalent than 
here.  

Also, keep in mind that if you get one you may not want to take it into 
most parties.  I'm sure security won't be too understanding.  (However, 
I've heard of very lenient staff at U.K. raves that had "testing booths" 
where anyone could get a pill tested.  I like this idea a lot, since 
because so many people are going to do them anyway, they might as well 
know that what they are taking is what they *think* they are taking).  
Something big like Family Affair, though, would be the perfect place to 
have and use one, since there are so many pills going around, and of 
course there are going to be some people who are just there to rip you 
off.  I like the idea of these kits because they have the potential to 
keep people safe (safer).

Whats up nuttynetkidz.  I just have a question aboot saturday.  1) Rumor has
it, the partay will be at Trilogy.  If thats true will it still be all ages?
Because @ Robert DelaBlahblahblah it was advertised as all ages.  I brought my
brother along and was turned away because he didn't have a picture I.D. .
2seconds later 2 cute girls with a sob story were let in without I.D., that
was fucked up!  I don't want to bring my brother down there to have his hopes
of dancin' crushed because he doesn't have a nice rack and cute belly.  He has
a state I.D., but I'd still like to know.
My second question do you think that the Trilogy staff would let me bring in a
small cooler?  I want to bring in a lot of FREEZE POPZ for everyone to snack
on.  Because it gets hotter'n fish grease in Trilogy!!  I don't wanna see none
of ya'll fall'n out from a heat injury!  
P.S.
OoOOo I'm soOo excited about saturday,  is there a time set for the net-meet? 
Thankz
Moze

ha ha-i have a funny story about this.  i work at this financial consulting
group doing odd secretarial and clerical jobs.  anyways, i usually don't have
a lot to do some days so this one day i was just looking up stuff on the web
and i came across the entire publication of E is for Ecstasy.  Since i had a
few hors to kill i printed the entire thing out, made two copies of the
document, and then made covers for them and then binded them into two books.
and who says work isn't fun?  :)

okay, here's my deal...i have taken a few things, never in mass amounts
and rarely more then once...i preached for a long time about the
"naughtyness" of drugs and someone called me on in...so i did
some...through out the past few years.  I have never taken a thing at
parties except ginsing and the ocaisional minithin or three to open up de
lungs and the blood vessels, and i am very proud of this.  I go from 10-10
dancing the entire time never stopping to snort shit up my nose or swallow
pills down my throat.  I don't need it.  The true idea of living my life
by the ideals of PLUR and the wonderful people around me are all i've ever
needed.  I don't preach anymore because i realized that this is my choice
and my reasoning...many people are in it for the high, and those are the
people i cant stand, but there are others who do it to inhance and
furthere their experience...i have no problem with that.  I just don't
need to do it.

oh well...just the reasonings of a recently de-teenaged candyraver....

PLUR = the only battle worth fighting..never give in!)

It will be all ages.  If you look VERY young, you may have a problem, and will
want to come after 2 oclock, otherwise, you should be able to get in without a
problem.

In a message dated 98-08-13 17:25:04 EDT, you write:

<< Rumor has

>>

Yes, all ages, as far as I know. I doubt highly that ids will be checked
(Matt, Viktor, and Rob, any comment on this??)

<< do you think that the Trilogy staff would let me bring in a
small cooler? >>

I highly doubt it... but maybe if you arranged something before hand with the
staff... I dont know..again, consult rob sherwood or viktor on this...

<<   is there a time set for the net-meet? >>
<<  so where is everyone meeting at phorm?  i've never met anyone on the list 
before (besides 1 person) and don't know who to look for.  >>

I think we said roughly 2-ish in front of the main stage (in the big, main
room)...but it may have changed... anyone? anyone? :-)

<div>&gt;*** 'Ryan' remains atop hot box office</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;If you wondered where everyone was this weekend - they were at
the</div>
<div>&gt;movies. Early estimates of the weekend box office show the top
three</div>
<div>&gt;movies brought in more than $16 million each in ticket sales.
But</div>
<div>&gt;despite the competition from a pair of openers, Steven
Spielberg's</div>
<div>&gt;&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; retained its top spot on the
box-office chart</div>
<div>&gt;for the third straight week. The film brought in an estimated
$17.6</div>
<div>&gt;million, raising its 17-day take to $104 million. Coming in
second</div>
<div>&gt;was the new thriller &quot;Snake Eyes,&quot; which earned $16.5
million,</div>
<div>&gt;followed by fright-sequel &quot;Halloween: H20,&quot; which
earned $16 million.</div>
<div>&gt;Rounding out the top five were &quot;There's Something About
Mary&quot; and</div>
<div>&gt;&quot;The Parent Trap.&quot;</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;*** CNN star Amanpour weds spokesman Rubin</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;Star CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour and U.S. State
Department</div>
<div>&gt;spokesman James Rubin tied the knot Saturday at a
lakeside</div>
<div>&gt;Renaissance church near Rome. Iranian-born Amanpour, 40, who
has</div>
<div>&gt;reported from Bosnia and many other world trouble spots for
the</div>
<div>&gt;television network, wore white for her marriage to 38-year-old
Rubin</div>
<div>&gt;on the banks of Lake Bracciano. After a Catholic service at
the</div>
<div>&gt;church, they held a Jewish ceremony at the nearby Odescalchi
palace.</div>
<div>&gt;John Kennedy Jr. and his wife Carolyn Bessette attended the
wedding,</div>
<div>&gt;but celebrities such as Jane Fonda and her husband Ted

<div>&gt;*** Michael Douglas denies injuring caddies' testicles</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;Michael Douglas is teed off about a lawsuit blaming him for
injuring</div>
<div>&gt;a caddy's testicles in a golfing accident, and the actor said
Friday</div>
<div>&gt;he would take legal action to protect his name. Douglas issued
a</div>
<div>&gt;statement denying allegations in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit
filed</div>
<div>&gt;Thursday in Manhattan federal court accusing the actor of
striking</div>
<div>&gt;the ball without yelling &quot;Fore!&quot; and before the caddy
was in a safe</div>
<div>&gt;location. He also denied he had made a racial slur about the
black</div>
<div>&gt;caddy. Douglas said another member of his foursome last year at
a</div>
<div>&gt;charity tournament in Westchester County, N.Y., was the golfer
who</div>
<div>&gt;struck the caddy with a drive while the caddy was on the course.

<div>&gt;*** James Bond films getting more violent-UK censor</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;James Bond films are getting more violent in a bid to compete
with</div>
<div>&gt;Hollywood blockbusters, Britain's film censor said Friday.
Chief</div>
<div>&gt;censor James Ferman revealed in his annual report for the
British</div>
<div>&gt;Board of Film Classification that several cuts had to be made
in</div>
<div>&gt;&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; so the board could give it its
target</div>
<div>&gt;classification for 12-year-olds. He said the film starring
Pierce</div>
<div>&gt;Brosnan &quot;followed the pattern of the recent Bonds in being
slightly</div>
<div>&gt;too violent for its intended audience.&quot; This was in
contrast to the</div>
<div>&gt;Bond films which starred Roger Moore, he added. &quot;In an
effort to</div>
<div>&gt;compete with Hollywood's action adventures, far higher levels
of</div>
<div>&gt;violence were injected,&quot; he said. (Reuters)</div>

<div>&gt;*** No blue suede shoes, but Elvis lives at rock museum</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;There may not be any blue suede shoes, but Elvis Presley fans
will be</div>
<div>&gt;treated to an array of &quot;The King's&quot; artifacts, some
never seen</div>
<div>&gt;outside his home in Memphis, Tenn., at the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame</div>
<div>&gt;and Museum's new exhibit that opened Saturday In Cleveland,
Ohio.</div>
<div>&gt;More than 100 items, ranging from the 1942 Martin D-18
acoustic</div>
<div>&gt;guitar on which he launched his music career to daughter Lisa
Marie's</div>
<div>&gt;tricycle, are on display in the rock hall's first major
exhibit</div>
<div>&gt;devoted to a single performer. The display is being presented
with</div>
<div>&gt;Memphis-based Elvis Presley Enterprises, which operates his
former</div>
<div>&gt;home and now museum, Graceland. The rock hall said Elvis was
the</div>
<div>&gt;obvious choice for its first single performer exhibit.

<div>&gt;*** Ravers flock to Europe's number 2 techno fest</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;Close to half a million people swamped Zurich for the annual
techno</div>
<div>&gt;music Street Parade Saturday, Europe's second-largest techno
festival</div>
<div>&gt;after the Berlin Love Parade. Techno fans, called ravers, garbed
in</div>
<div>&gt;flashy costumes or scantily clad for the hot weather, swarmed
from</div>
<div>&gt;across Europe for the parade of 30 booming sound trucks along
2.5</div>
<div>&gt;miles of the city's lakefront. Swiss railway SBB ran 50 extra
trains</div>
<div>&gt;into Zurich from all points and estimated that 200,000 people
came by</div>
<div>&gt;train especially for the parade. Around 900 police and
medical</div>
<div>&gt;officers were on duty, but the only problems reported were
minor</div>
<div>&gt;injuries such as cuts. See</div>

For some reason, I've tried to post two different messages, but neither 
of them posted.  Grrr.  Anyway, here's some info on the testing kits, 
where you get them, what comes with them, etc.  I wrote some people back 
about this, and I was way, way off on the price.  These things are 
actually downright affordable.

Anyway... (this is from ecstasy.org -- I forgot you could order these 
there).  The problem with ordering from here, unfortunately, is that the 
amount in pounds has not been converted to dollars, so you have to call 
the U.K. and ask how much to send.  As soon as I can find a better 
source for the kits, I'll post it.

The Basic Kit consists of the Marquis Reagent testing solution, a scapel

accurately measured, so that it can be compared with pills already

the precise dimensions match.

     well, i can speak for myself, not, perhaps for
     others, and as for myself, a mild manic-depressive,
     drugs have allowed me a rare feeling of happiness
     that, even if artificially induced, i still value
     very highly. that's why i don't do them all the
     time, either. i value all my experiences, induced,
     enhanced, or not, regardless. life is too precious
     to miss.

     yes, i find taking drugs (for purposes _other_ than
     pure hedonism) to be enlightening. for the first
     time since i can remember i was truly happy. i would
     call _that_ enlightenment...

     spiritual? nah. not in the cliched religious sense.
     but try walking through the city on ecstacy at 6 am 
     on a cold autumn morning as the sun is just starting
     to burn away the night haze, and all the buildings glow 
     like big blocks of cinder, and you hear the city start
     to breathe, and you can feel through the soles of 
     your feet this big ball of earth we call home waking
     up and growing, changing, alive...

     and then get back to me on that spirituality shit :]

> 
     add to that the fact that if you go to two or even
     three parties every weekend, plus a couple club 
     nights, the cost of doing drugs at _every_ party
     makes rent look like pocket change. i learned _that_
     one the hard way. :]

     plus i'm bored with just going to parties and getting
     messed up on my own - i don't meet anyone or if i do
     i don't remember them, whatever. if i'm by myself i
     try to stay clean and get a different kind of 
     experience. it works. not nearly as surreal, but more
     useful, in a way.

     but if i have someone along with me that i connect
     with, or feel some attachment to in some way, going
     chemically altered can be a wonderful thing. try it
     once. (try it a whole bunch of times :).

     i think amanda knows what i'm talking about.

     but anyway. the master of digression. <cough>
     ok... my car's clutch imploded, turns out. the
     pressure plate collapsed, and needs to be replaced.
     so i'm without a ride to phorm, i think, unless
     the shop has a pact with the devil and can get it
     done by saturday. anyone?

okay i htink that i'm gonna reitterate some of the things that i
said...aafter rereading my email, i came across sounding a bit militant,
and that, by no means, is what i wanted to do, especially on a subject
that has made some friends of mine hate me.  Anyway, I am a raver, Plain
and simple.  I have adopted the trappings of the lifestyle and the joys
and pains that go along with it.  I don't mind saying that this is what i
am, simply because i think party kidz are the true changing force of the
future, we are what is going to make the change.  

Drugs are things i don't play with that often. I do them ocaisionally,
namely alcohol at christmas (dysfunctional family traditions die hard)
and
i have rolled a couple times.  E is a funny drug, and i don't recommend it
to people who think too much and over analyze everything.  It has changed
me, i have to say, and i'm not upset about that.  But it's something i
save for when i'm with friends in an environment where i am completely and
totally already in love with the people there.  I won't ever  roll at a
party, it fucks up my judgement, and well, i want people to know that i am
sincere in the things i tell them, not just overwhelmed by there new
presence as well as with all the seretonin in my brain.  Hmmm...i think
i'm comming across as a hypocrite...but so be it.

Anyway, i do think that crystal is one of the vilest nastiest things on
the face of the planet along with K.  Why, is all i can say.  Oh well, i
think i'm slowly following the footsteps of geekboy and mastering the art
of digression, but i just feel so weird about this issue.  As for the
walking in the city at dawn and feeling the earth and the air stir around
you and in you while rolling, baby, i know what your sayin.  AMAZING.  and
i can feel that naturally now. 

Blah Blah Blah...kidz just watch yourselves, and don't let things get in
the way of the higer goal that being a "raver" can be.  Fight for the
truth and honesty of a world that can be forever free of the vile bullshit
that is currently scraping away it's beauty.  Fight for life and beauty.
And if that isn't enough, fight for each other.  We are making a
difference, slowly but surely.

There...that's my Henry the Fifth (if i'm wrong, many apollogies) call to
arms...i'm done now.  Sorry...hee hee

this may be a wake up call for some of you out there...

as you know there was a bust @ crystalized 2...

there were 12 arrests...

one person was somebody i knew...the person had in her possesion an
amount of crystal meth...how much, i don't know...she is currently still
incarcerated in the loraine county jail...needless to say, she is in a
world of pain...god knows what kind of people she has to share her cell
with...even worse, she can't afford bail, which is set at $1500...and
since bail is usually 10% of the total fines, she is looking at $15,000
in fines and up to 5 years in jail if found guilty after trial...

this is just a reality check for the folks out there that may have 
forgotten that illegal drugs ARE ILLEGAL...meaning if you are caught with 
them, YOU ARE going to jail...and if found guilty, you will have to pay quite 
a hefty fine...and you will serve time with people you would rather not deal 
with...it will go on your permanent record...meaning that you will most 
probably have to work some shit job for the rest of your life, if any one
hires
you at all...

	Does anyone know where I can find the Johannes Heil LP, Realty to
Midi? Specifically the 'Paranoid Dancer' track? I haven't been able to
track it down as of yet.  I really have gotten obsessed with this track.
You can hear it at this sight:

	As always, any help is greatly appreciated! :)

you need never do such silly things again! : ) 

http://www.xe.net/currency/

is a very easy to use currency converter that defaults to changing
pounds to dollars.  : ) 

hope this saves you some long distance charges.

I am not receiving the messages I post.  Hotmail is saying that they 
were sent, but I haven't gotten the last couple.  Has anyone else ever 
experienced this problem?

for the record. hotmail is right behind aol in "reliability"
....   meaning shit that comes back to me undelivered or with problems.
thing is i get msgs back from hotmail that are error msgs, but dont tell me
the problem.  guess what i do ????   unsub them.  problem solved.
hotmail has not replied to ANY of my requests for info on why i get so many
errors, but what do you expect with microshaft running the show.
my advice, as mean as it sounds, get a real email address.
i had to unsub ~10 hotmail ppl yesterday or the day before because the
accts just "dissapeared" as it would seem.  all at once.
i wouldnt trust 'em, a few ppl have complained about different stuff and it
just dont add up.
trouty.
p.s. hotmail prolly queues up msgs awhile before actually transporting them
out of their systems, so there might be a lag,,,,  you get that alot with
email...

Here I am right, rolling it BIG TIME. Excuse my bad english throughout.  
I don't usually do it at clubs but I was getting bad vibes and I wanted 
to change it. And so it did kinda change the scenery.  Atomic had to 
many not so good people there if you know what i mean. I am not usually 
like this  but I felt like I was at Stratus Nite Club, only worse. I was 
getting my groove on(probably the drugs though).  The music seemed 
right.  Some people made me smile:) And again I did not get to meet any 
of yall. I really wanted to today.  I was about to go around asking. 
Well, the whole time I was looking for geekboy but no he supposedly 
wasn't there(he is very distinguished).  So life is alright and right 
now i cannot stop smiling:)  This was a good drug, a very very good one. 

Anyway if anyone saw me this time, this is what I looked like...
My hair is cut short now and it is dark blond red brown etc..(everyone 
says I look like Sarah Mclaughlin). I was wearing a striped tank, it 
showed my clevage too much and kackies(can't spell presently) jncos with 
a green stripe down the side. I was with my friend who is so damn cute.  
She was wearing a short skirt(I convinced her to be comfy and be 
herself) and a sexy tank.  She is very exotic(medium length brown hair 
with a gorgeous body).  I know some of you all had to be checking her 
out. We were getting stalked by two "weirdos" the whole time. This was 
uncool and it reminded me of this one guy at Mekka in Columbus. He would 
spot me everywhere and follow me throughout the night. 


Well I left a little early 1:45 and that was alright.  I don't think I 
missed much. On my way home here I was driving a little fast listening 
to Portishead and others like her.  I got pulled over.  First time in my 
life.  I was shocked and freakin' scared.  Look I am still rollin' and 
my eyes look like fish tank eyes(as my friend would say). I was driving 
double the speed limit.  The cop took my licence, registration, and 
insurance.  I looked down at my feet--good thing I did not look at him.  
I kept saying sorry but thats all.  He asked me where I came from.  I 
was like a club.  He said,"so your keyed up".  I was like"NO no no". HE 
LET ME GO!!  WHOO HOO  and this is why I cannot stop 
smiling:):):):):):):):):):):):] let me stop

Anyway, I probably will laugh at this later

I simply cannot resist.
NO POINTERS?!?!!? Its done entirely in pointers, thats the beauty of it.
Having C/C++s pointing abilitys with raw calculations being performable on 
them is neat for doing tricks and showing off and what not. But its also 
the source for a major amount of the errors and security violations.  Java 
teaches you how to properly write code that is going to be used by others 
while still giving you enough power to get most anything down.  If you cant 
do it in java most likely it should be done in raw assembly anyway.
I wouldnt so much as say its programing with your hands behind your back as 
keeping the kids away from the chainsaws and handguns.

i agree that C is the god..  but i am not a fan of Java.. it is just
like programming in C with your hands tied behind your back..  no
pointers?  c'mon.. what's up wit dat?  C has got to be the nicest

or ask schwanke about 3dmail, you gotta pay for it, but you can pop3 it AND
read it from a browser.
definately a plus.

(but no mskw1), and cafe2000 (jason) were all there... all *very* cool kids,
might i add.

well, to say it shortly, atomic was once again a LOT of fun and i would
definately recommend it to all you guys... its definately up there as far as
weekly events go in pittsburgh...

before i go, i just wanna say: EVERYBODY HEAD OUT TO ANDY (the pooh)'S BBQ
THIS SUNDAY!!  it's gonna be a lot of fun and will be an awesome time for
all... not to mention an awesome place to crash for all us cracked out phorm
attendees..

speaking of phorm, i'll see everybody there. i can't wait.

Just wanted to mention that the Eagle's Nest is not a virgin space.
I attended a small party there in the spring and had an awesome
time, even though there were probably less than one hundred people
there. (unless you just meant virgin for you...)

This is defanitly NOT a virgin space.  The first party to be held there was a
party called Deliverence back in late march/early april 1995.  It was thrown
by Brian Wheeler, and the then young UPS crew.  I beleive it was the second
UPS party after Imagine.  Pretty good time.  This was the first time I saw
Carlos. I believe it was one of the first partys Carlos played in this area.
Brian used that space 2 other times after that.  
Just a little History lesson.

" (I also remember there were some ravers with 
glowsticks there that night who were making fun of the way people 
danced, and I was afraid to dance near them.  I guess this is a pretty 
damn odd first impression of "ravers.")"

Damn straight. I was at a few raves, where people just mocked the hell
out of people,
outloud, right in front of the person. I have a feeling these people were
so self-conscious
about themselves that they had to make fun of other people.

I don't think that is what the scene is about? I feel it's about loving,
sharing, 
affectionate feelings towards one another? Am I right?

lAter.

I don't think I would agree with this advice.  I might actually say
that E is better for people who think too much and over analyze
everything, because it makes you step back from all that shit and look
at things from a super-happy-couldn't-have-a-care-in-the-world type
attitude which is a nice change of pace.

I'm not saying it is good for you specificaly, liquid, but I wouldn't
go as far to make that generalization.

ps-one day untill PHORM!!!!  This is gonna be the biggest net-meet ever!

I'd like to take a poll:
who on the list has heard a story going something along the lines of a
person having an entire sheet be in contact with their skin for a long
time, sweating a whole bunch, absorbing the sheet through their skin,
going mental, and being put away in a mental institute for a long time
thinking they are some sort of fruit?

Something like this has come up several times, and completely
different people have said, "YEAH!!!  I KNOW THAT PERSON!!"  Or "That
was my friends BEST FRIEND!"

just tryin' to clear up another urban legend :)

i've heard this before..  in the version i heard, the guy was selling
doses, got caught by the cops, and tucked the sheet into his pants and
took off running.  he began to sweat profusely and absorbed all the
lsd..   soon enough he's in a mental ward thinking he's a glass of
orange juice and afraid people are gonna spill him..   total bs... 
urban legends are amusing, tho..

<< Okay for those who were at crystallized2... when did the party get raided?
>>

The party got raided, as close as I know, about 8 in the morning. Actually, I
was upstairs talking to Bizz and helping get things ready to carry downstairs
for the afterhours, when I walked downstairs to find someone and alas,
everyone had been cleared out. Luckily, I missed the brunt of it, but I did
walk down right in the middle of two cops bragging in their beefy cop way
about how the one cop "grabbed some kid by the shoulders and threw some kids
right down the stairs" from the first level of the party to ground level (a
good fall). Needless to say, I was moocho impressed. I just strolled by, gave
them a dirty look and headed out to the street to find everyone. Meanwhile my
boyfriend is screaming at me from across the street, prolly thinking I am lost
and in custody. Well, the bust definately sucked, and I am lucky no one
stopped me as I was chewing hard-core on my pacifier, but at least they waited
until the afterhours to bust it ;)

just trying to look for the postitive...

    I'm going to make a big pb-cle sign and hold it up around 2AM in
front of the main stage. This will help everyone find eachother since
we've never actually met before. So keep your eyes peeled around 2.

hey!  this is a good urban legend; i've got a true story along the same 
lines.  my friend isaac of the gumby ears was at a dead show in portland 
and some guy with a blue bottle asked him if he'd like to tie-dye his 
frontal lobes.  isaac took two gulps from the blue bottle and was a 
glass of o.j.  needless to say, it was nice clean liqiud in that bottle.  
isaac "came to" about three days later, completely naked in a drunk tank 
in seattle, no clue how he got there or where to go from there.  and let 
me tell you, he has not been the same since.  he's not a glass of fruit 
juice anymore, but he's not the same isaac, either.

i've been very happy w/ yahoo mail... it is a bit slow occasionally,
but its a pretty good service. you can have it automatically file your
mail info folders + shit... it dealz with attached files nicely and
you get 3 megs of space. not bad. all-n-all it's pretty speedy, tho

Yeah, I think everyone has heard this one at some time or another.
Actually, there was just a thread on this exact subject in 
alt.drugs.psychedelic, so it must be Very widely known.

Hi kids-for those of you lucky enough to be heading up to detroi this weekend,
here's some info i thought i should pass along.  the party is free to out of
staters.  all you need is a valid state id and three canned food goods.  if
you don't have either of these you're going to have to pay $25 dollars to get
in so don't forget your cans and your id!  have fun this weekend!

i was at trilogy two weeks ago and it was not hot at all!  even on the dance
floor!  but i've only been there once.  but freeze popz are still such a cute
idea - how could they turn that away?  also, about the kids who got turned
away without id ... i think most ofem got in after the boys inside figured out
what was going on.

Whats up nuttynetkidz.  I just have a question aboot saturday.  1) Rumor has
it, the partay will be at Trilogy.  If thats true will it still be all ages?
Because @ Robert DelaBlahblahblah it was advertised as all ages.  I brought my
brother along and was turned away because he didn't have a picture I.D. .
2seconds later 2 cute girls with a sob story were let in without I.D., that
was fucked up!  I don't want to bring my brother down there to have his hopes
of dancin' crushed because he doesn't have a nice rack and cute belly.  He has
a state I.D., but I'd still like to know.
My second question do you think that the Trilogy staff would let me bring in a
small cooler?  I want to bring in a lot of FREEZE POPZ for everyone to snack
on.  Because it gets hotter'n fish grease in Trilogy!!  I don't wanna see none
of ya'll fall'n out from a heat injury!  
P.S.
OoOOo I'm soOo excited about saturday,  is there a time set for the net-meet? 
Thankz
Moze

Attention...Attention.  This is john Matthew's partner in Teknova.  The
Detroit party this weekend is NOT free.  It  is only free if you can answer
3 questions at the door.  nobody knows what kind of questions they are
going to be.  So go at your own risk.   but be forewarned. 
respect
BIG john
p.s.Jungelists are you ready for the rewind!!!!!!!!!!

Well to everyone it may concern.  We took care of the age limit bullshit,
and it is now an all ages show.  So come one come all.  No bottles,
markers, drugs, or FREEZER POPS!  One way to stay cold would be to smuggle
the freezer pops in the club by shoving them up your ass!  All major
arteries and veins run in that area and it will cool your body faster. 
Then if kids still want them, you may pass them out.  (All meant to be
sarcastic, since most people have no sense of humor anymore!)  Also, we
prefer the girls wit' the big phat asses and big phat titties to go along
wit' it.  
I think the stress is hitting me!?

Wondering if anyone can hook me up with any articles/writen pieces (or
sources) on girls in the rave scene, either as djs/performers/promoters or
just the general situation of being a girl in these scenes that are
supposedly so open-minded, but so unbalanced.

thanks much -

Directions for Phorm will be posted tonight.  It will be held at Trilogy
2325 Elm st.  There will also be after hours directly after the party. 
This event will be fucking wicked.  For those of you who have never seen UK
jungle dj's before or a smooth mc like Warren G  (not nate dog's homeboy) 
this is event not to be missed.  And if you don't know what a rewind is,
you better fucking learn real fast, because it is up to you to call for one
to the wicked selecta'.  So bring your whistle's, horn's , or whatever and
prepare for some real fucking bass in ya face motherfuckers!!!!!!!!

T-minus 30 hours and countin'.

All right, 1 day to go before Phorm.  In case you haven't heard the "Free"
party in Detroit has a few catches to it.  It is only free if you can
answer 3 questions at the door.  Nobody knows what kind of questions they
are going to be.  So go at your own risk of paying anyway.

I'm sorry.  I guess the stress IS taking its toll. Perhaps you should see
a doctor.  If you prefer well endowed females, will you be refusing all
Carpenters' dreams at the door.  Do you also prefer boys with big willies
or do the small ones suffice?

Silly, those were Spike's grandparents!  I thought they were WONDERFUL.
They actually knew how to dance.  I wish I could dance like that.  I would
always dance like that at raves.  In fact, I sort of learned how to Swing
last year at school.  Next year, I'm going to learn how to belly dance. =20

The first question is: "Why are you stupid enough to drive all the way to
Detroit when you could have stayed in Cleveland for the best party of the

song by harvey danger (heck i dont even kno the name of it! i wasnt really
paying much attention when they said the name).  In the very beginning, the
lead singer explained how this video was about someone who doesnt fit in. so
eventually there comes a part of the video where kids are dancing with
glosticks.. and a member of the group was like "the kidds with the glosticks
are ravers.  this is what they're like, but we wouldnt know" (iat that point,
i totally became so overwhelmed (sp?) with happiness.

i thought about all you wonderful kidds, and i was so happi to be a part of
this scene, _our_ scene.  i kno im just a new kidd, but i finally feel like i
found my place.  i just wanted to thank all you fantastik kidds for being the
fantasik kids that u are.  i understand there is a lot of negativity going
around these dayz.  thats why a kouple of us kidds are starting a new project.
(more info to come posted by VIBES420 <josh-e> or contact his website).  i
hope for all of you to be a part of it.  

one more thing before i go, id like to make a plea.  i _really_ want to go see
the crystal method in cleveland sept. 19th.  my mom*eE -was- gonna take me but
it turns out shes going out of town that weekend :*(  is there any one that
kan hook me up? pwease ? ill pay for gas and goodies :)  <iM in eRiE>

once again... THANK YOU ! ! and i wuv u all ! !<hUGs>

peace luv and glitterbugs,
       linzEE

OK, we're leaving early tommorrow morning for chataqua so this may be
the last time I check my e-mail before we leave.

Net meet in full effect at the front of the dancefloor all night long
baby.

I'll be wearing a bright orange and yellow reflective running vest, so
it should be easy to spot me.  i'll prob have a hat on too.

The second disk of the Circuit 6 double CD is being pressed, so if you
deserve one for some reason, come up to me and phorm and ask if we
haven't already shoved one in your face.  To all those who don't need
one for promotional reasons, you're just gonna have to wait untill the
ful double CD comes out :)

     well, since i'm depressed, lonely, tired, sick
     of running on zero funds and bad credit, kinda
     pissed at nobody calling me back (but one person)
     and basically not reciving communication from
     _anybody_ about things i _need_ to know, and
     just sitting in the computer lab doing a bad 
     impersonation of a wet blanket, i decided to 
     reply to this horribly joy-filled missive.

     <cough>

     i have to admit that i feel a little the same
     way (altho not just now :) and also have to 
     admit that the rave scene changed my attitude,
     nah, changed my life. not the glowsticks, not
     the music, not the glitter, not the lights, not
     the money/glamour/drugs/chyx/stress(yeah, i like
     it)/energy/acceptance. none of these things.

     it was learning how to tell somebody that i 
     loved them.

     not some stupid cliched hollywood stereotype
     shit. not some huggy feelgood stuv (altho nothing
     against that) nor your average hormonal driven
     instinct-fulfilling stupidity.

     but just telling somebody how i _really_ felt
     because it meant something.

     and if you can believe it, before about four 
     months ago, i had never told a single person, in
     my entire life, that i loved them. talk about 
     fucked up... my upbringing had turned me into an
     emotional ice-cube. it seems impossible now. i
     dunno how people dealt with me.

     anyway. somebody else blurped all over the list,
     now i have to. i'll probably regret it later. 

     but yeah. whatever. i'd literally forgotten how
     to smile, bitterly unhappy, jaded, thinking that
     life and relationships were both shitty AND
     transitory, vaguely wandering toward some hated
     goal.

     and you kids taught me how to smile. i can never
     thank you enough.

     love
     geekboy

Actually this should go for any drug or similar effect. It definitly works 
with lsd.  When you are under the influence of something that is intense 
mentally or bioligically it is ingraned in your mind along with the 
surrounding atmosphere. When the surrounding atmosphere is recreated the 
memories return. As a result the 'memory' of the high is brought back and 
the similar mindset is resumed.

On a side note, there is such thing as a contact high (which would also 
contribute to the feelings).  When someone is high their body language and 
patterns change markedly, when other people come in contact with this 
person their mind automatically tries to 'compensate' by adjusting their 
own mindstate to match the other person's so as communication can be 
achieved eaiser. Violah, contact high.  :) Cool no? Some people are more 
sensative then others (friend of mine gets as high as a kite when he is so 
much as near someone under the influence of lsd and he has never tripped 
himself).

This is all part of the 'vibe' that people talk about.  Ever been to a 
party that was predominantly made up of acid heads? They ROCK because the 
whole party is following the same mental schema, same prolly holds true for 
e and varios other stuff. When the entire group is traveling in the 'same 
direction' everyone feeds off of everyone else and the vibe is rocketed to 
hell and back!

If you've taken a fair amount of e, you becomes so conditioned to
feeling good when the music's pumpin' and the light-show is going
that if you don't take anything at a party and just give yourself to the
music you CAN feel really high. It's just like Pavlov's dogs I
suppose...

Let me start off with the important details:
1) The show is all ages! 
2) We strongly advise getting there early, this event will sell out. 
Besides that the     music gets buck wild from the start.
3) Admission is $20 b4 midnight and slightly more after.
4) No bottles, markers, bad things in general (ya'll no the dilly).  Also
absolutely no     one should come to this event that isn't ready to have an
incredible orgasm (no     masturbation required), the bass will hit you in
all the right places.
5) i think that's all the details for now.  The info line has further shit,
but nothing I       have not mentioned here.
Info Line number - 216.556.2305

DIRECTIONS:
>From the east:
PITTSBURGH - 
	Take the Ohio turnpike west to the 71N exit (exit 11), take 71N to exit
#245 	(Fulton Rd/West 25th St.)  follow signs to West 25th.  Off the exit
ramp 	make a left (North).  Then follow common directions.
ERIE/BUFFALO -
	Take 90W thru downtown Cleveland to the 71S split.  The first exit ramp is
	exit #245 (Fulton Rd/West 25th St.)  follow signs to West 25th.  Off the 
exit ramp make a left (North).  Then follow common directions.
>From the west:
Chicago/Detroit -
	Take 90E to exit 170A (West 25th St.) make a left off of the exit ramp.  
Then follow common directions.
>From the South -
Cincinnati/Columbus -
	Take 71N to exit #245 (Fulton Rd/West 25th St.)  follow signs to West 
25th.  Off the exit ramp make a left (North).  Then follow common 
directions.

COMMON DIRECTIONS:
	Go north on west 25th about 2 miles (~18 lights from 71 exit or ~10 lights
from 90 exit).  you will reach the corner of Detroit and West 25th (there's
a church straight ahead of you) Go forward.  At the first stop sign you
reach you will turn right on Main St. (follow signs to Flats West Bank). 
Continue down Main 2 streets till you hit Center St., make a left.  Go down
Center one block.  You will hit Spruce St., make a right.  And you are
finally there. 

There is a pay parking lot on the left ($6), which I recommend using if you
can.  Right across the street from the lot entrance is Trilogy night Club. 
It is on the corner of Spruce and Elm.  Addy is 2325 Elm.

Please everyone drive safely and use your street smarts, we hope to see a
large positive vibe show up.

Expect to have your bags lightly searched and maybe a minimal pat down upon
entering.   If possible have photo ID for 18 and over, if under just say
you forgot it.  

I have spoken with all performers, all will be there and there might even
be a surprise or two.

Definitely,
Matthew

Well come today (finally) the show will go on!  Around 9 PM tonight my mood
will mellow simply cuz' the fact that I have done all I can do.  The rest
is up to the kids.  Nothing more I can do will change the outcome of the
show.
	Also i have no particular taste in girlies.  Just as long as they aren't
stupid and ignorant as hell, which unfortunately most of the girls (and
boys for that matter) are (to many drugs maybe?). To put it simply
impressive genitals and other features aren't my interest.  Whatever
happened to going for the music, not because the bomb E is there!  I think
I went to far on that one???>

Sorry I posted late, I wasn't sure if I should go to Detroit or PHORM.  But
since I am throwing PHORM I figured I should go there.  So I will be there.
 (Of course joking!)
Matthew <teknova@gte.net>

Qoutes in my mind for PHORM:
"It made me think that everything was about to arrive - the moment when you
know all and everything is decided forever!" Unknown

"A culture and what it produces
is made possible by
and is reflective of
the knowledge that underlies it."

Yo,
 I just wanted to remind everyone that PHORM isn't an all jungle party.  There
also happens to be a very good selection of techno and house, ambient?(we'll
see), and also some trance, and hey, why not some gabber as well.  

 If you can manage to put down the airhorns and lighters for a few minutes, it
will definitely be worth checking out Christian Smith (our main man from
sweden) and Barada (aka Bryan Zentz) spin either one of their tagteams (one
will be techno, and one will be house).

 One more thing, if you are a guy, the staff at trilogy LOVES when you dance
in their cage.  

Lou

<<"Why are you stupid enough to drive all the way to Detroit when you could
have stayed in Cleveland for the best party of theyear?">>

WHAT IS....

#1. Im not a junglist  
#2. I don't want to be at Trilogy for the "best party of the year" I like
Trilogy, but it's just not big enough to have such a huge ass party. ( In my
opinion ) It's gonna be crowded and hot as hell. 
#3. There are some kids I would like to see that I haven't seen in a while
and most importantly #4 THE MUSIC in Detroit, there are going to be DJ's there
that I would rather see over Diesel Boy...Im willing to travel the 4 hours to
go see...surely you guys understand that...
#5 It's not everday I pickup and just go to Detroit, however I have been to
Cleveland a zillion times, to chill, for parties whatever

Because I wasn't sure if I would be coming to the party earlier this week,
I didn't pay attention to when & where it would be.  Could someone send me

Long hair, goatee, minus the robe and sandles. I'll be wearing green pants,
black boots, and a tropical looking shirt over a white tshirt. Chances are
i'll be infront of the stage (jungle room) by the left speaker getting my ears
blown out. So if you see me don't be shy and say hi :) or bring a piece of
paper with "hi" written on it because i'll be too def to hear ya!! :) see ya

I suggest that we move the net meet to the men's bathroom at 2:00 A.M.  At
raves, all the bathrooms are co-ed anyway.  The meeting at the front of
the stage is silly because no one will be able to do anything but nod and
smile.  Hell, we won't even be able to see each other clearly.  In the
men's bathroom it'll be quiet enough to actually talk and light enough to
see to whom we're talking.  We can meet at the front of the stage, but
let's move it to the bathroom (bathroom talk?) afterwards.

i believe Braden's idea is perfect! what's a meeting if you can't talk or see
who you're talking to.

    The time will be around 2AM in front of the main stage. I'm bringing a sign
that'll say "PB-CLE" on it. Look for it everyone! See you up there! Really
lookin forward to this one! (but who isn't??)

Well, I am officially jealous. I cna't makte it up to Phorm tonight :*( For
one, I am beat (I just moved *all* my crap into my college adobe) and for two,
I am broke. As that red-headed orphan said: it's a hard-knock life. You guys
have fun for me though...I wish I was gonna be there. Hopefully, I will get to
meet some of you at Sensual though in two weeks. Drive carefully, drink enough
water, and best of all: know your dealer! Let's not forget that tragedy that
befell some of the kids from Crystalized 2 last week. Have fun and be safe! :)

much luv,
the kitten

feeling that it's going to be the best night of my life-- and frankly, I
can't deal with waiting any longer!  I've put so many expectations into
Phorm that I'm literally going the other way now, namely, I'm getting
nervous, perhaps afraid something is going to go wrong.  I think it has to
do with the fact that there are going to be so many people there who I
know and deeply like (or want to meet).  It's also Viktor's last party --
a symbolic thing, at least for me.

The pre-party jitters are such a mind game.  Anyway . . . that's me.

See ya there,

Braden

To All,
       Recently I have been given the fine pleasure of reviewing one of
Pittsburghs premiere D.J.'s!!!!  Her name is DJ K.A.L.I.     

      She is one of the ORIGINGAL old skool members of the Pittsburgh
Hardcore!!!!  And her sound and style is just as rough and rugged as she
is!!!!  I recieved an email from her today asking what I thought of her demo
entitled, "Rebelgade" And this is what I have to say....

     The quality of the tape was superb!!!!  And if you're into TRUE HARDCORE!
than you'll LOVE this demo!!!!   TONS of 909 and 808 kicks!  and some very
wicked guitar and Godzila samples!!   She has tracks that reminded me of the
days of old when Diselboy spun NOTHING but old breakbeat and when Deadly Buda
announced himself with his infamous intro........Buda........Buda Buda....!!!!

       In short, the tape was very good and only for the head strong!   

               Much Thanks and Props To DJ  K.A.L.I

               Sincerly
                Cafe 2000

i can hardly beleive that i'm typing this, but it looks like i'm not
gonna make it out to phorm tonight...

i'm still trying to figure out what i did to deserve not going to this.

everything was going great up until about 6:30 today. someone had kindly
offered me a ride (thanks tom), and i was all ready to go. i had my
camera, my blow pops, my pop rocks, my water, and my bubble gum.

then, a string of shitty and twisted things started to happen. first
off, i missed getting picked up by my ride. i ended up being 30 mins
late to the pickup stop because of my leaving 10 mins late and then
because of a wreck on route 28... because i was in such a rush to get to
the pickup stop, i didn't bring my ride's pager number or house number
or my cell phone, so i had to call my house to try to page my ride...
needless to say, things didn't work out...

an hour and a half later, i was making the 40 minute drive back home
from oakland, thinking of a plan B.

my plan B was to just drive to the party by myself.. all of my friends
had already made plans for the nite and i just wanted to get there. so
there i was, at 10:15, ready to make the two and a half hour trip
solo...

i'm not even out of my neighborhood yet, and what happens? yep, you got
it. my fucking car starts making this awful grinding noise... i tried to
change into first gear and back and the fucker locks itself into first
gear...

so i was left with the choice of taking my parents car, which was locked
in first gear, hundreds of miles into the unknown, or *sigh* ...staying
here.

i guess i really wasn't left with much of a choice....

anyway, just wanted to let everybody know why i couldn't make it. i just
listened to the infoline one last time, the whole time imagining how
much fun you guys must be having out here... welp, dance a little for
me, k?

i'll probably be happy as usual at the next party you guys see me at,
but till then...

Make some noize! All the pb-cleaves internet massive.

      3 room setup in Club Trilogy in the clevland flats.  So much great
music. Thus, I will only mention the sets that I saw most of.
     Sleepy C was getting things started in the main room, good dancey
house to get in the mood, but it seemed he was having problems a couple
times.  Still, quite fun.  The 2nd room (Triology Backstage) didnt open
until 10:30.  In the 3rd lounge area (w/ 2 tiers)  Rob Marley from
Rochester was setting up and finally played an amwesome set of what
sounded like dancey trance of some sort.  Although the room was small
there were some corners left open for a little dancing.
     I stayed in the lounge (room 3) pretty much most of the time during
Dieslboy's set and things were started to get crowded.  In that room
they were playing more of what sounded like hardcore techno in the
'ambient room'  I did enjoy  what Ithink was
Locutus set on a progressive tip in the 2nrd (backstage) room.
     Finally around 2 or so the UK Jungle orginalist massive landed.The
familiar voice of the McWarrenG filled the space and you could tell things
were gonna get hype!  The net-meet by the dj booth was in full effect with
some bright orange signs.  It was awesome seeing them being held up for at
least a couple hours? Props to you dedicated net-raver heads.  
     Shy Fx was the first DJ and it was incredible.  A couple of Rewinds
(um i didn't notice any selectas) that just had the place going mad with
Whistle blowing, foot stomping lighter carrying kids.   DJ SS lived up to
his reputation and boosted the crowd even more.  To my memory it was sort
of a tag team between Shy FX and SS, but I could be wrong.  Anyways I cant
thank Phyrl enough for bringing these guys to da area.  As far as my
jungle interests and roots are these guys are basically the first jungle
artists I have ever heard and nothing compares imho :)  Warren G was
giving shout outs to all da cities and most importantly a shout out to
the pb-cle-raves "internet massive" (thats us)  I was very proud to see us
in full efect for a better part of this incredible set.  John B and Warren
continued the Junglisms but people slowly started leaving tha dance floor
and Warren started making a sort of complaint by  making a comment to the
effect of you shouldnt goto parties if you can't dance all night. :-)
    After that I was pretty much tired myself and headed out, but want to
send out props to all those that made this night happen (Phyrl, Teknova,
Trilogy, and of course all of you who came and represented the massive)

Jbrick

PS Thanks to whomever gave me the small stuffed Rihno.  I should have been
paying attention.

plur :-)

Wow.

Ok.  That's all I got to say.  If you missed it go dig a hole to bury
yourself in.

Anyhow, mad props going to everybody I met out there:  Casey, Jade, some
guy named Ned or Nate or something-who the hell are you?  The guy who
held the sign for sooo long-you gotta have sore arms or something.  All
the other people who I can't remember from the list and all the people
giving and getting hugs-it was awesome.

Today I'm the unlucky bastard who has to go to work still-all you people
sleeping in: you better appreciate it. So I gotta go. Peace. Out.

PLUR,
Ben

WOW!! WOW!! WOW!!
The party last night was off the hook!! I had so much fun. The music was
awesome, and there were about 3000 wonderful people!! This party was a
reminder for me. Just when I think about not going to raves as often as I do,
something wonderful happens, and I get reminded that "this is why I continue
to go to raves"

Im moving :-)~

Where to start?
Maybe wit' a huge THANK YOU! to everyone and anyone, and hell even if you
didn't come to the party THANXS for not coming.

Truly everything was perfect. Right # people, venue size and security.
I am about to pass the fuck out, but I want to thank those that came.  The
vibe was totally kickin'.  I had a great time.  And I hope all of you did
to.

THANK YOU!!!
 
*****the stress is finally over, the shit went off and all onlookers were
satisfied!  I can now relax.  
I'll post more detailed shit later, when I awake.
Definitely,
Matthew

amen.  all the busters that said they would drive/go up bailed on me 
last minute sometime around 9 or 10 last nite.  all the b-boy action the 
nite before drained their monies and nrg.  since i have a hard time 
finding my way out of a phone booth, i wasn't about to fly solo.  to 
those that got to go, lay out some life-like reviews for those of us who 
almost sortof but didn't make it  ;)

for the cats that didn't get to go, i feel it.

Well first off I gotta give a big thank you to all of the netkidz.  You showed
up gave sugar coated love& incredible hugs.  A big OL "hell yeah" to all of
you that held up the signs!!  I met Matt and his friend Jen and greeted and
hugged many others.  You'll have to excuse me if I can't remember any ofther
names. At 2:00am it seemed that the roof would blow off.  Everyone was
screamin and stompin to the beatz.  It was such a sight!!!  DJ SS and Shy FX
kicked more butt than Pam Grier in Foxy Brown.  Shy FX's set was soOo tight!!
The Punisher laid down some nice tracks.  Barada had a nice sound and kept the
people jump'n.  I couldn't stay back there very long because the heat was too
much!!
I had so much fun last night!  The vibe was awesome, the music was slammin!!
I wish that Trilogy could be like that more often.
If you didn't get to meet me, you may have saw me across the dance floor or in
front of you.  I had my glowing ball that expands and stuff.  Its called a
HOBERMAN'S SPHERE.  I got it while I lived in DC at a store called the
Learning Smith.  It was so much fun watching peoples faces light up.  Others
would scream in terror, I guess we know what substances they had ingested=)
Well anyway I hope to meet more of you next time.  
Thank you PhRYL, Technova and all of you that made last night what it was!!

I'm am soOo happy to be home again in Cleveland!!

It was free, and no questions were asked. We were told to have a good time and
that was it. Im not sure where you are getting your information....

This page is updated every minute, so you can see if someone is on IRC
without logging on.  In case anyone is interested.  It is done by one of the
channel bots.


http://www.erienet.net/~circle/links.html
This page is updated every couple of hours with the most current Efnet
servers.   If you have tried using IRC and can't seem to find anyone once
you /join #pb-cle-raves -- then chances are your aren't on EFnet, or the
server you are using is split.  Choose one from this list and you will find
us.

http://www.isicom.fr/airhitch/ircle.htm <-- IRCle (for mac)
In case you still haven't figured out IRC and are curious, you need to use
one of these "clients" to connect to a "server".  Once you are on a server,
you can find us by typing "/join #pb-cle-raves" or any other appropriate #
(channel).  Trust me, there is a # for just about everything ;)
mIRC is pretty much the standard for windows IRC clients.  I prefer pIRCH -
the main reason being is that its free (no nag screens), and it is much
simpler if you are just beginning.  Additional help can be found by checking
out the links page listed above... or the pages it mentions.

Ok. I understand how a promoter feels when his or her party is on the same
night as another major party and the 2 are just a few hours away.  I have been
there.  But this was just plain rude.  It seems to me these guys were trying
to sway people from going to detroit by making up some bogus story about these
3 mystery questions.  As you have probably been informed, there were no
questions to answer.  I assume it was the intention of these promoters to make
up this lie, just so people wouldn't go to Detroit.  This is not the way to do
business.  This is something that just shouldn't be done.  If there is another
party on the same night as yours, so what?  Go promote as hard as you can.
Don't dis the other guy, especially since he didn't do anything to you.  
just my opinion,
Jason

Amen!! Even though I don't throw parties to me this was very upsetting. I
can't believe someone would be that low..lying?? It makes me think about not
supporting other events. Why would I want to? Their parties will reflect their
minds..pure shadiness. 


As I sat there last night, the one thing that truely fucking amazed me was
that this party was thrown out of love, or something great...I have never seen
so many people happy. I would say about 70-80% of that party was on the dance
floor last night.

Amy said it right when she just said WOW! This party WAS off the hook. And I
had no intention of going to a party at all this weekend. Lemme just give you
a little re-cap of my Saturday...

7:30 in the morning I get up, and along with the help of my boyfriend, his
friend, my little brother, my brother's friend, and my father I shove all my
belongings in the back of a UHaul van and we head down to Lexington, so that
this kitten can move into her college abode. I spend all day lugging furniture
up three flights of stairs, trying to scramble to put things away, whilst my
boyfriend is pouting that he wants to leave that god-forsaken city and head
back to Cincy so he can do something fun. Fine. We get back to Cincy around
5:30, and Joe and I get in a fight. He heads up to Dayton, and I am left
sitting in Cincy bored and upset. 8:00 I call my friend MIchelle to ask her
what she is doing that night, I figure maybe she's going to a club or
something...nope. She tells me to get in the car and book it to her
house...we're heading to Detroit. Before I could think of what I was doing...I
was on my way to Detroit, having never planned on going anywhere that night.

Boy am I glad I did! It was my first Detroit party, and it was
*unbelievable*...one of the best parties I have ever been to. Great music,
great vibe, and great kids! I was sure surprized to see Cincy so well-
represented at the party, but it was good to see. The moon-walking bubble
thing was unreal! I don't know what else to say, but that I will be heading
back to Detroit in the not-so-distant future for another party! The night was
crazy!

Needless to say, I was in a bit of trouble with Joe when I got back, after
just taking off for Detroit...but if I was gonna get in trouble for taking off
and heading to a party, I'm at least glad I picked a worth-while party to
fight over ;)

<< Amen!! Even though I don't throw parties to me this was very upsetting. I
 can't believe someone would be that low..lying?? It makes me think about not
 supporting other events. Why would I want to? Their parties will reflect
their
 minds..pure shadiness.  >>

I have to say I agree with Amy and Jason. Whoever this "Big John" character
is, I'm GLAD I didn't support his party, and I seriously doubt I will in the
future. Trying to undermine other kids when they have invested large ammounts
of time, energy, money and love into a party is just plain low. For those of
you who missed it, you missed out. Fuck the System was *off the hook*,
completely free (no questions asked), and held at a great venue. I can't wait
until the next one I go to.

Anyway.....PHORM was awesome. The vibe was so great I would have to rate 
it on one of the best party lists that I've gone to(and I was mostly 
straight).  I loved meeting everyone from the pb-cle rave list. 

Everyone is so sweet and cool.  I couldn't possibly name all of you in 
fear that I would forget someone.  Well, I trully mean it everyone I met 
was superfly:) I was proud to hold up the pb-cle sign(Jesus {david} was 
hard-core holding that sign for like 3hrs).I hope to see everyone at 
parties again.  I'd be disappointed not too.  Remember I am going to 
live in Columbus now, but i will come back to Pitt and Cleveland and I 
hope to go to Toronto and others also.  

Shy FX and Warren G were my fav that night.   They got me pumped up 
along wit the pb-cle crew. Of coarse I loved seeing dieselboy anytime. 
The music for the most part was tight. Geekboy got me craving house 
though(shame on him--just kidding).

Sorry I did not make it out to the after party. I wanted to go but 
geekboy and i were kinda slowing down. Plus, getting that 50 dollar 
parking tic ruined my mood. I hope I can convince them to cancel it. 
Urgh......:O :< :( 

Geekboy and I went to Andy the Pooh's bar bee que.  I only stayed for 
like 1.5 hours or so but  it was nice meeting Pooh for the first time 
and others again.  And personally talking to others.  Watching "mother's 
day" was da bomb. Too bad I couldn't watch the whole thang. You guys 
crack me up!

Well,  all I have to say is "good stuff".  Sorry if anyone had to miss 
it. 

Luv ya all
bEnny

    Thanks to everybody from the list that was at the party and at the
net-meet. It really made my night. As I told alot of people there, it
was like our own private party right in front of the stage. Mad props to
Dave (jesus) who held up the pb-cle signs for 3 hours or more! It was
great to finally meet some of you guys! Shouts to Amber, Dave, Moze,
Henry, Benny, Casey, Steve, the kid in the reflective vest, and everyone
else I met, but can't remember their names... (you know who you are and
you know how that is....) As you may have noticed, we created an amazing
vibe at our little private party. It was like we had this bond
already...wonderful experience. thanks again to everybody and I hope to
see ya all again soon.

-matt

P.S. I will continue to bring pb-cle signs to every party I attend. So
be on the lookout! If anyone took those signs home with them, keep them
to remember the great time we all had at Phorm!

I'm not 100% up on all their stuff, but i know they do some wicked deep
electro (non-cheezy breakin' music - check interdimensional transmissions)
and they did at least one 12" that was acid-hardcore which was also quite
nice....i think they do a PA when the play out....

[Crossposted to the Pgh goth/industrial list and the Pgh/Cleveland raves
list.  Watch your replies!]

The In Pittsburgh review of the latest Pitchshifter release can be seen
(as of right now) at: http://www.inpgh.com/current/arts/disc.html#3

Although I would only give the new Pitchshifter CD a mediocre review
myself (it is very similar to the new Cubanate), the reviewer shows
incredible ignorance of electronic music in general:

* "Herky-jerky drum machine patterns": it's called breakbeats.
* regarding sampling: "Originality is not the name of the game here." His
  understanding of "sampling" probably consists of ripoffs like Vanilla
  Ice.
* "At least fellow industrialists Ministry and Godflesh concentrate on
  grooves": a comparison to metal bands?
* Perhaps the most insulting of all: "real musicians who have spent time
  and energy to learn how to play real instruments will always win"

It still shocks and saddens me how many Americans think that using
electronic instruments is somehow easier or less creative than spending
hours programming, tweaking, and manipulating.

I plan to write a *polite* but critical letter to In Pittsburgh right now,
and I hope that fellow Pittsburghers will do the same.

i was closed-minded and addicted to the second room.  it's very funny (not
really), on the way up i actually made a schedule of what DJs i would
experience so as to increase the efficency of rave-pleasure based on dj
style, i adhered to nothing, as usual.  i was successful at carbo-loading
before the event.  something told me not to eat any protein.  i had 6
pieces of 12 grain whole grain up yer ass bread, 2cups of oldschool
oatmeal, and megadoses of already large vitamins...i had to skip out on
the potatoes because i was about to vomit.  when we got there [alsion (a
review from her is pending), tom, geoff, john, and beverly] i noticed that
the space wasn't "mean" enough.  but, hey, it's a quasi-all-purpose
nightclub.  there were many people just standing and sitting...that's not
fun.  immediately, i found the second room (i think it was called the
underground, or something with a U in it)  it was the very hot and dark
room for those that dont know.  yeah, hot and dark qualify as mean.  me
and alsion wandered in there, i immediately took my bag off and whipped
out pills.  i still have this horrible shin problem from the intergalactic
circus.  i took about 15 aspirin, more vitamins, ginseng, and gingko....i
never saw those pills or my bag again.  the sound in the room was always
house/tech-house/techno.  i believe it was locutus that was spinning house
as began to dance.  everyone's favourite house-fanatic..henry, was up
front egging the DJ on with profanity and rapid arm gestures.  at this
point (20 minutes later) i was superstaturated and just had to take my
shirt off (awwwll shiit).  if anyone noticed the ectomorphic bald kid w/o
shirt with a preference for his right leg, sometimes just hopping on
it..that me.  i took my shirt back to where my bag and water were (the
station), and it is not there...it took me 3 seconds to realize what had
happened, i thought of spike, prayed, and said fuck it....danced for 6
more hrs.  locutus wasn't as memorable as the other DJs in that room so i
will end discussion of him..but he was slammin' just as well.  then the
punisher came on!  i think this was 1:30-3:00...i really cant remember
what she was playing.  well, i can't narrate it with the english
language...it was hard, primal no frills techno..with the beat that
Everyone loves!  i'm sorry i missed the netmeet, as i stated earlier, i
was addicted to that room.  i'd rather dance than interface at a rave (not
being rude, it's just more fun..and raves are about absorbing pleasure).
anyway, my schedule was pretty much a wave with a water break every 25
minutes.  at some point i went into the 3rd room, the temp was great, they
should have expedited it to the second room with the crazy vent structure.
i saw henry again, and left.  there didnt seem to be any dance going on in
dare.  yea, i'm in the second room again.  i beat the system..i asked for
an empty cup instead of buying that insane water!  there was a drunk guy
on top of the right stack for a while...that was very distracting.  i
thought he was going to jump on us (like he saw on TV or something).  he
vascillated -hard- a few times and finally dropped his bottle.  i had to
clean that up..broken bottles on the floor are just not conducive to a
good time.  he kept saying he was sorry...haha drunk people are dumb.  my
intergalactic legs were fine until i tripped over someone else's leg...dun
dun dun!  i thought i was finished, it was the emotional low.  i couldnt
even stand on it.  oh yeah, i met jade7337 again.  where were the net
ravers in the 2nd room?  where is diversity!? ;)  back to the leg, i sat
down for a while..then it went away.  i went back up and attempted to
bounce and everything was good.  punisher was getting ready to leave.
from that point on, it was about 3 X 3 in the front of the dancefloor for
the rest of the night.  i looked around occasionally, and there were
massive amounts of people just sitting on the now-closed bar and standing
in the back.  people guarding the walls, and there was a constant flow of
people sitting on the front-right couch.  punisher is gone, she filters
thru the crowd.  i thought she was point alpha or pure because i remember
that one of them was girl from FL (someone clear me up)...after four
attempts, i realized that she said punisher.  christian smith came on and
had me in automaton mode the entire time.  i didnt realize that he was the
artist that i was sitting there gawking at during 27.  he has a highly
defined head-bob..so i was like: ohhhhh.  thanks for bringing him in again
because i wasn't ready to rave at 27 and i remember thinking how hard his
set was and how i was not taking advantage of it.  does anyone know how to
contact either 'the punisher' or 'c. smith' for media?  at times in
smith's set people crowded the front just to look, i'd say a max of 27
past the couch.  president clinton was playing with a hoberman sphere as
he walked out of church yesterday.  he sent me a private email about that
death-threat compton thing and i pacified him.  welp, i am still in the
second room...props to the people that were fanning, lending glowsticks,
and doing that discotechesque taunt dance where you rotate in a circle and
swing yer arms low like a monkey while moving in and out of some invisible
center with me.  next comes barada, his style was registering very similar
with my brain and i was beginning to become intolerant of house and techno
(but not really :)) at this point.  i remembered that the punisher was
spinning GABBER in the fabled third room...i walked in, the sound was low
relative to the second room and no one was dancing so i decided to leave
again.  then i heard the most awesome track of the evening, possibly life.
barada was spinning it.  it was techno interlaced with some kind of
resonant atari2600 noise (it didnt seem like it was a product of any of
the normal synths)...does anyone have access to his playlist? ;)  i wish i
remember i could play it back in my head..i guess i'll have to wait.  they
all come back, at least the really good ones, usually while you are eating
dinner or taking a test.  speaking of ears, i had the really odd kind of
tinnitus right after i left.  the kind where everything is sped up so it
sounds like tha chipmonks.  that went away soon, but low sounds are so
amplified.  like, typing and today i opened mail and it sounded like it
was aluminum.  oh yeah, and frankie was in the house room for like a
second..i give him credit, being a junglist and all.  speaking of frankie,
i saw todd and seth in the main room..i think that covers everything.  i
want to go back; bouncing is so fun.  i will be gettin ready for college
during this week (and that *is* serious ;)) so i dunno if i'll be eventing
or not.

or you could've just read the annotated version...

that was so fuckin fun!

that's odd, because the in pittsburgh has been pretty

Unfortunately, mskw1 and I did not make it to phorm.  I'm trying very hard
not to kick myself too hard.  We went to Dunkin' Donuts instead and that's
all I'm going to say about that.

  Personally I haven't checked the Pitchshifter disc, but the one single
  i heard from them was ok production, but really barely so-so in
  musical goodness (opinion of course).  kind of a cheesier form of the
  new cubinate.

  You have to be suspect if their cd title is: www.pitchshifter.com. LOL!

  I don't think its really a product of being 'american'...just a product
  of being a clueless reviewer.  InPgh has done some ok stories on
  electronic/industrial stuff in the past like Ryu said...but rarely if
  ever have they done electronic disc reviews.  

  Segueway....(heh heh)....which brings me to a point:  i'm finishing up
  the next issue of Technology, which has lots of reviews of
  the spectrum of techno-industrial music from people who are a bit more
  informed than this bloke + lots of event reviews + dada-tronic wholesum
  ness.  Issues are free of course, and should be out next week.

  l8s,

     and now, for the short encapsulation of the party
     weekend, from our journalist in the field.

     <pause>

     um... atomic this weekend was cool as usual, a little
     too much trance for me, but a nice crowd without a 
     large proportion of inebriated civilians.

     nice seeing pooh, spike, liquid, shade[lurker], cara,
     and jen there. many thanks to jen for being so nice
     and making my evening that much more fun. hope mike
     gets better soon, rgdz.

     <fade to black>

     ok, phorm. first off i have to give a big virtual hug
     to the list's benny haha for giving me (and lilsarah)
     a ride up to phorm while my car was in the ICU. thanks.

     got there around 9:45 pm, the doors weren't open yet,
     and didn't open till about 10. there were at least 100
     kids outside waiting, with a large number of net-heads
     there as well. 

     the door was really nice and was totally cool about
     getting me on the GL even tho i had difficulty 
     communicating with the promoters about it previously.
     props to teknova/phryl, those of you i met were really
     friendly.

     it got continually more crowded and hotter as the night
     progressed. the second room was literally unbearable 
     which was a pity as the sound/music in there was slamming.
     they should have had a few intelligent fixtures in there,
     or something, tho.

     i started getting paranoid around 1am as victor/2 tigers
     wasn't around and he was supposed to bring a large number
     of preflyers for me. around 2 or later i found him tho,
     and got a box of 2500 preflyers out of his car. so i could
     relax for the rest of the party, at least.

     there were tons of netkids at this party. i met my fellow
     CIS deviant, jeffrey brick - geeks know how to party. also
     met amanda and eric, a sickeningly cute couple. you two
     are the luckiest ppl in the world - i am totally envious.

     wanted: 1 (one) cute raver chick to accompany cute raver
     boy on long party weekends. must be willing to travel long
     distances in search of the perfect vibe. should appreciate
     quality chemicals and good house, gabber, and trance. must
     have cropped, bleached hair and a large supply of tiny
     tank-tops. strange piercings not a problem, strange sexual
     habits even less so.

     yeah, whatever. <giggle>

     my brain is pretty fried right now.

     i have to say that the main room was slamming, the vibe
     was decent, although some friends got their bags stolen
     and i almost fucked some drunk guys up for harassing my
     friends. mad drugs everywhere, noticed some guys inspecting
     a heavy chunk of herb by holding it up and illuminating
     it with a flashlight, etc. judging by some people's 
     violently happy activites, some nice and pure x in 
     circulation. cool. note that i was totally clean the 
     entire evening for essentially financial reasons, sorry.

     loved the MC ('let's hear the whistle massive', 'oh my
     gosh, this record is fucking great') and had lots of
     fun dancing up front with jbrick, absolut, et al. got 
     my terminator shades right here :].

     shouts to: benny, lilsarah, xspyboy, jbrick, absolut,
     frankieG (bummer about your bag), andy toth (bummer about
     YOUR bag), liquid, seth baum, braden (and your girlie,
     i keep forgetting her name), eric, amanda (please clone
     yourself, NOW), jesus, don (wizard workshop), tom, geoff,
     john, the guy with the glowball, steve ford (saw you, is
     all), matt, and all the other people who said hi to me
     and whose name my overloaded brain failed to register.

     toth, fix that leg. nice seeing a non-junglist raver
     boy. smile, liquid. cool shirt, absolut. spike, mskw1,
     cara, pooh, jen, we missed you :|. next party?

     l8r

That would be me.  Christian Smith's set took the night for me, though
Punisher was great too.  Christian's set was harder and tighter than any of
the other 3 times I've heard him.  He kept his eye on the crowd almost
constantly, locked on one dancing person to see what effect his tricks
would have.  I know pHryl has a mix tape of his for sale from Progress in
Toronto.  His label, Tronic, is at www.tronicmusic.com .  I'd like to hook
up with a Punisher mix tape too..anybody have any leads?

Anyway.  Good party, good kids.  Made for a great weekend.

Ken

really?  i wonder if he was experimenting on me.  i gave him a goofy face
and he returned it and i was like "wow, communication with the DJ!"  

has anyone else classified their "levels" of dance intensity?  level one
would be just a foot stomping or a body gesture just to keep the tempo
(this is either a sign of rest or malinterest in the particular track).
level two would be nominal dance with synchronized feet and arm movements
(flailing arms, crossing feet, formation of geometric patterns with arms).
i busted into level three about six times during the morning.  it was
completely uncontrollable, violent, creative, new, movements that i can
only compare to aggressive african dance.  i doubled the dance-radius and
violently arched my torso in both directions.  it was raving, i guess.
they lasted for about 2 minutes; highly pleasureable, mind-fusing.

i was also handed my first pair of glowsticks...yes, horribly sad that i,
a double-digit event goer, haven't used them.  i just never felt the need,
and there is something about them.  when i got them i was inclined to
dance-harder and i felt that i was on partial display.  this was
distracting.  however, i did gain some feedback from watching my own
glow-trajectories.  i loved the one light in the second room, thanks for
beaming us, (viktor? dude with digital camera)

	i kinda got the notion that a few of us acted as
second-room-vibe-pilots. ;)

Techno Music Saves Wildlife!

                                                                      

  LONDON (July 21, 1998 08:52 a.m. EDT http://www.nandotimes.com) -- After
hip-hop, fish-hop. Britain's water
               companies are broadcasting "rave" music underwater to try
to boost fish stocks.

 With numbers dwindling and anglers facing a rod-and-line ban next year,
the water companies are turning to music
 to reduce the number of fish that die after swimming into treatment works
and reservoirs. There's only one snag:
                         the dull, thumping beat can be heard on the river
bank.

    Thames Water admits that the heavy bass is audible "when the water is
calm," but says that the music is
                          successful in keeping fish away from treatment
pipes.

      Britain's biggest water company denies that its new deterrent will
disturb the quiet of the countryside.

 "I admit you can hear the beat, but it is rare," a spokesman said.
"Besides, there are very few people living along
   the areas where we are using the technology. We have had no complaints
so far and do not anticipate any."

    Thames installed the $21,000 "acoustic screens" in seven reservoirs in
London and Southeast England after
                   thousands of fish died after swimming into pipes and
treatment works.

  Salmon are in particular danger and are drawn to the pipes because of
the strong currents created by reservoir
                               pumps. Most die after snagging on filters.

 However, when they are confronted by a heavy pulse, they turn tail and
swim against the current back upstream,
                                        where they spawn.

Andy Turnpenny of Fish Guidance Systems, the company which has spent 20
years developing the shield, says fish
                                  react in the same way as humans.

"It is just like standing in front of a very loud speaker at a rave. It is
very uncomfortable and fish, like most people,
                                   head in the opposite direction."

 Turnpenny describes his underwater composition as "a sort of whoop,
whoop, whoop with a thump between each
                                             whoop."

  "I am not very good when it comes to modern music," he says. "I am told
it is techno, but that does not much
              matter. What counts is what the fish make of it -- and they
absolutely loathe it."

                              By JOHN ARLIDGE, London Observer Service.

phorm was phabulous!!!!  i have not been to a better party in cleveland, 
ever.  the vibe was beautiful, high energy and good kicks.  i, like all 
the other kids i know, danced my little tootsies off.  big hugs to all 
of you net kidz that i met (what, like three of you???)  i was too busy 
in the music to meet anymore.  geekboy, we'll catch each other next 
time!  i have to admit that i thought that trilogy was a bad idea (i've 
been goin there since i needed a fake id, and that has been a few years, 
and then some!) but it turned out sooper, though hot!!! and crowded.  i 
think that i met more great kids because i couldn't avoid bumping into 
them.  next time, i'll avoid the emotional hijinx that plagued me this 
time and i will eat my pill a little later (who bought up all the tweak 
and left none for me???).  all in all, woW!!!!
a special thank you to the little prince, david.  you saved my sanity 
and made my night!  i love you.

This was a totally bogus post and I can't believe it was done by a "promoter".
Why spread TOTALLY untrue rumors about someone else's party??????

If any of you listened to this post and didn't go to Fuckthesystem in Detroit
last weekend ...you missed out.   It was sooo phat!!   And all for 3 cans of
food...
no $20, no major security hassles, no "Are you 21?, no hot and cramped
dancefloor, etc...   Just ` 2,000 kids dancing ALL night under the stars and
right next to the bridge to Canada.   It never rained a drop and the
temperature was perfect.   Great music and a beautiful vibe!

	Phorm.  Good Lord! Thank you so much to everyone who was involved
in throwing this event.  Dieselboy was killer as he always seems to be :)
Here's where my question was...does anybody know what that track was at
almost the very beginning of his set? Very smooth with the female vocals?
It was like within the first 5 mins of his set.  Anyways...
	I had my girlfriend with me, and a friend from work, it was her
first event.  Boy was it a doozy for her! Talk about your fucking
introduction to the rave scene! So we missed the very begining of Shy FX's
set.  We were talking about dancing and stuff...I mentioned that I don't
dance just cuz I never do...I just dig listening and watching everything
unfold...and told her my friend Dave (jEsus) don't dance either.  So about
20 mins into Shy FX's set we head down to the main floor..."Where's Dave?"
they ask...I look in amazement...There's Dave surrounded by about 20-30 of
you netheads dancing his ass off pumping that sign in the air! I had to
look again to belive my eyes! I said "He's the one with the sign!" My
girlfriend's and my co-worker's jaw drops! Followed by the hugest smiles
you can imagine!!  That memory will forever be with me.  :) I got some
photos..tho they didn't come out great...but I scanned them and sent them
to Trouty.
	Speaking of memories...this was the last of my summer parties.
ANd this has been the most fun and memorable summer I've ever had.  And
it's not only due to the fantastic parties (tho that's a big part of it)
it's due to the fact that I've finally stepped out of the shadows and have
been meeting you guys.  I've met so many intersting people off this
list...it just makes everything in the scene/environment mean so much
more.  Thank you to everyone who took the time to talk to me and get to
know me...and allowed me to get to know you.  You've brought so many
beautiful memories without even trying...just by being yourselves.  Big
end of summer shouts to Braden, Casey, Steve, Eric, Todd, Tom...even those
whho just introduced yourselves...and I'm horrible with names...thank you.
:)

happiness,

brian

What a bunch of lies...   I PERSONALLY  went to Detroit  (I mean I was
there...not as in I heard from someone who might know someone and an now
passing it on to you as fact)  and I personally  got in with 3 cans of food...
no questions, no hassles.    It was an awesome party!   Great space, great
music, nice people!
I will not hesitate to go to another one of their parties. 

AND PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE this post as a cut on Phorm.   That looked like a
great line-up too.   It just makes me sick that a promoter would pass along as
FACT  a  lame RUMOR that they either made up or heard from someone that didn't
know what they were talking about.

Dear Fellow Space Cadets-

	Perhaps for some of you new to the “rave” scene, it might be surprising to
know that the subcultural artistic movement we belong to, started in England
during what was called “The Summer of Love”, back in the late 80’s as an
underground movement.  A movement based on House, Techno, and Acid music, but
most importantly,  based on a feeling of LOVE.  Ever since then the raves were
supposed to be a safe arena where all people can come together to share and
celebrate through the music, leaving behind our differences on race, color,
national origin, age, social status, creed or religion, gender, sexual
orientation, or any kind of social intolerance or antagonism that do nothing
but lower the quality of the human spirit.  In a rave, you are supposed to
leave your attitudes outside, and join your fellow brothers and sisters hoping
to participate in a mind-expanding experience, in unity with all.
Unfortunately, this is a utopia premise that is bound to fail.  Our scene has
been the target of plenty of attacks by the authorities and the media all over
Florida, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the planet.  In Orlando
Florida, The Club @ Firestone became the epicenter of the massive Florida
scene.  This club has been an influential breakthrough in the development of
underground music in the area, and it is also a favorite spot of figures such
as Paul Van Dyke and Sasha, just to top a long list of outstanding
international and local DJ’s and musicians.  By prohibiting the legendary
Saturday late nights, imposing curfews (curfews that are more suitable of a
fascist or communist regime), along with closing The Edge in Ft. Lauderdale
and not allowing some other events, the reactionary groups and the media have
definitely hurt our scene.  These are the act of arrogant ignorance that even
seem to be endorsed by the so called alternative and progressive older crowds
by just remaining silent, failing to realize that when some of us loose our
freedom, everyone else does also.  It is rather ironic that these people call
our music “non-melodic noise”, where as the generation before them call
rock’n’roll “non-melodic noise”.  If you are able to vote, get informed, know
your enemy and go out and vote next time.  Do it!  Yet, the saddest part is
the attacks we are inflicting on ourselves.  What’s up with that attitude
kids?  What’s up with those kids ready to stamp a Nike logo on someones face
just for more room to spin on the dance floor?  What’s up with the nasty
attitudes the B-boys throw at the Club Kids just because they are too
outrageously dressed or pierced?...Nobody has ever made fun of the way you
dress....What is up with that snotty cliquish attitude of some that have been
in the scene for very long and are at the cutting edge? ...Does that make you
any superior? ...Don’t think so!... Or those so called “mature” ravers who
look down on Candy-Bubble-Gum ravers and quote them as “cheesy”.  We need to
understand the cultural value of the Pop-Art iconography this brings, our
freedom of choice and the fun factor (yes, even pacifiers and backpacks.  Just
think of Andy Worhal!)  The last thing we need is a dress code.  Think- isn’t
this shit pretty much against all what we stand for?  Aren’t we as intolerant,
mean, prejudiced, and ignorant as those who attack us??!  What’s up with the
scammer promoters who screw up DJ’s and ravers?  What’s up with the nasty
security?  Or those who claim that “everyone needs something to believe in”
and then don’t give a shit about safety, overcrowding, overheating, and our
political problems?... What’s up with some places letting ate-up  under 16
year olds to come in just so they can make more money?  The media just loves
it!!  ... ”What’s up with that South Florida lame ghetto attitude where girls
beat up girls, or raves that end up in fights or even gun shots?  DJ’s need to
check out the intentions and the vibes in their record bags!  How about those
DJ’s that sell-out to music that induces Unity and a general groove, but play
what promotes attitude and competition?  A big thank you and respect go out to
those promoters and DJ’s, and the “boys” who are true to the scene and who put
out quality stuff.  We love you, please don’t give up!  What’s up with those
who haven’t learned to respect their bodies and abuse them carelessly?  You
are at the core of our problems... Please be careful, remember that less is
more, if you respect yourself and your body, you will get more out of the
experience.  Getting fucked up is not what it is all about!!!  It’s about
having a good time, opening your mind, connecting with others, and reflecting
the positive experiences onto your everyday life.  Dropping that extra roll or
mixing shit is not going to resolve your personal problems!  The answer will
come from within, not from without.  How about those who can’t find a roll
that one time and then stay pissed off all night long?... You are missing the
point!  And also, who isn’t tired of the rude and pushy drunk frats and
trendies who come to our scene just because it is “cool”?... What’s up with
those who bitch, yet do nothing for the scene.  You forget that you are the
scene.  You, me, all of us who are looking for the key, the key that will open
up the door to the world, the world of love.... It is very simple:  if you
love our scene, do something constructive about it.  If you don’t like our
scene, stop bashing it, get out of it, and get a happy life.
	Many have jumped onto the novelty wagon of the raves without realizing that
we actually have a philosophical base:  PEACE, LOVE, UNITY, and RESPECT.  Yet
maybe we, the veteran ravers to accurately pass on the message of P.L.U.R. to
the new kids.  True, the scene is not what it use to be.  Of course not!  It
will never be, and that’s okay.  Our scene, as our music, is based on an ever-
changing dynamic, we must learn to guide it in the right directions.  If the
scene ever stops involving it,  it will certainly die.
	Nevertheless, the overlooked facts are the positive effects the RAVE SCENE
has had in many of us;  our scene is still a positive, friendly scene.  We
need to recognize the fact that we are the last significant youth movement of
the Decade, the Century, and the Millennium.  An underground movement that
belongs to the young people and that connect us at a global level.  Technology
has opened the door to countless young creative minds as never before in
history.  Minds that have produced outstanding, beautiful music never before
imagined, as well as quality Graphic Design Art as it is seen in out flyers,
magazines, and 3D Computer graphics, many of which deserving to be at any Pop-
Art gallery.  Our fashion designs are awesome and very influential to street
sport-wear.  This is all unique cultural expression that  is full of
innovation, energy, and rich in diversity... and it is ours!
	We are the ones who will take the SPIRIT into the next MILLENNIUM.  because
in the end it’s all about our people.  Those who make the music, the graphics,
the gatherings, those who dance to celebrate life.  Fortunate are those who
look at the world with the eyes and the heart of a child.  The UNDERGROUND
COMMUNITY, you know who you are, the space cadets, true to the scene, the
music, and most importantly their selves.  To those who are here to make real
friends at the scene, cultivate that friendship, it may be one of the most
valuable things in your life... This letter is for all of you, because you are
not alone.  We are scattered and divided.  We need to unite, reach out and
make contact.  Educate ourselves and others.  We are not the slacker losers
they want you to believe we are.  We are creative, dynamic, young, peaceful,
evolving, beautiful people.  Keep it alive, you are the underground!  We are
the children of light... Next time on the dance floor, on the playground, turn
around, look at the person you might even have fear of, smile, reach out,
share a hug, you might even make a friend.  Prove to those who would like to
poison and kill your young spirit that we are far beyond their pathetic
destructive negativity.  We are the children of the millennium.  Dancing the
groove with everyone instead of one.  Spread the joy around you with the heart
of a child!
				~Take care and respect yourself and others ~

before this review, i must say that it was quite wack, the technova
post about "fuck the system" - an event that seemed really, really pure at
heart.  why be like that?

now on to phorm.  oddly enough this was my first time @ a Cleveland event,
and as such me first jaunt into the world of Trillogy.  For you kids who
don't know, my impression was that Trillogy is the Metropol of Cleveland.
Maybe a bit bigger and a bit darker, and a much higher % of raver kids on
saturday, but still a similar type of space.

Our crew got together on schedule to bombard the space for the core hours
of 12-6am, whistles and lighters (but missin' the elusive airhorns) in
hand...if anyone was gonna make a ruckus it was us.  In the place, the
pb-cle massive was quite present! ;)  Somehow i missed alot of kids
because the music sucked me in...the time went so fast!  Shouts to all the
kids i saw and grooved with - the dancefloor love-lighter massive was
quite a sight....many smiles and hugs there...that's what a jungle fing'
should be like...jumpin' screamin and kids on the dancefloor being
friendly as hell!  

Overall the music was wicked....but i have to say one thing from the jaded
junglist perspective:  what were them uk kids thinking?   The US may be a
bit behind the UK, but not that far....maybe its just me, but i was
waiting to hear all fresh new rockin' material, with maybe a few classics
in the mix...and i was a lil' disappointed.  (damn picky kids!)

I think Dieselboy rolled it out quite nicely...in fact his set was
fuggin' amazin' upfront ebony-funk chunkyness that had my jaw dropping 
open a bunch of times.  Dark, evil and funky.  Shy FX came up with some
nice specials "CNN reporting that Shy FX will be playing in
Cleve-land"...and Warren G sure warmed it up nicely...again his selection
was awesome groovy stuff I'd kill for, but i think he was relying a bit
much on the MC rather than tight mixing....or mixing at all....:) 

Then we had the set of the night...the man SS!  This is the 2nd time I've
heard him, and to suffice to say, he's the wickedest dj I've ever
heard...the best selection, superb mixing skills, and he has probably the
most elusive skill - knowing what the crowd wants.  I say - no other
jungle dj has been able to make me jump and go beserk on hearing just the
first measure of a mix, but SS did it over and over - massive energy and
love was coming through there...some crazy new tunes, a few necessary
recent tunes (shadowboxin!!!), the lighter - i'm amazed the pb-cle sign
didn't go up in smoke at that point, and i almost pissed myself
when i heard champion sound!  

I know alot of kids were excited to heard John B - I sure was - he put one
of the better drum + bass albums this year and has an amazing style of
jazzy-trancy to darker material....sadly his set was really
disappointing...good mixing from someone who concentrates on producing,
but his selection seemed to be dissing on the american/cleveland
crowd...he played alot of tunes for the 2nd or 3rd time that night, and
his overall selection was something you probably heard @ SCJ 6 months
ago...not to be hard on him, it was fun to dance to, but it was more like
listening to a "greatest jungle hits 98" cd than one of the freshest uk
producers.  What was the deal with that...i think i only heard maybe 1
tune from their new Jazz + Bass LP, which is great stuff...

I caught bits of the 2nd room throughout the night - a good 1/2 hour of
slammin' stuff from the punisher, and i looked for the gabber around
5...but all i found was a really quiet soundsystem in the packed 3rd room,
so i had to vacate....

Hannibal i believe said the place wasn't particularly packed...but it
sure seemed full to me...dancing was a bit ruff at times, with alot of
kids walking around in the middle of the dancefloor and probably 1/2 of
the crowd just standing around, although i don't know how you could
possibly stay still...

Sure this review is a bit negative and a bit positive...and i guess that's
how the whole thing was for me, a fun time...wish i was there
longer so i could have chatted with more pb-cle kids...maybe i'm expecting
too much?  - props to Victor and Technova for putting on a great show and
bringing talent that we'd never see w/o you! Good luck back in Can-adia -
keep it up.

Many tanks to Tom and the PBS crew for the transportation: yins are my
saviors...

I guess that's it for the summer?  I don't know about anything in pgh
before school starts...Tod & Frankie: what happened to your park thing?
Anyone into a pb-cle renegade to finish off the summer?

well, while i had a great time at this, and witnessed one of the best 
sets ive ever heard (from ss), i really have not much to say. the vibe 
was tight, the space was mediocre, the sound was good but not fantastic. 
i just cant say what it was that i enjoyed about this party...it was 
just plain fun. shy fx couldnt mix at all, but his tunes were 
slammin...john b. played some unneccesary tracks, and wasnt that great 
at mixing either....dieselboy threw down a set 100 million times phatter 
than the one he dropped on tuesday.....thats all the dj's i 
witnessed...i stayed in the same area of the main room all night...i 
managed to miss alot of you, but i was tired as hell......it was nice 
meeting all you that id never met before/...big up alla the massive from 
my van.....
boy, was that a depressing review of a party that i had a good time at 
..i just have the strangest feeling about it overall.....a good feeling, 
but a strange one
sorry we couldnt help you out spike
sorry you couldnt make it out jen and mskw1
sorry you like house geekboy and andy toth;)
peace,
toM

Hey kids, now...here I sit looking at this outrageously phat flyer for this
Detroit party (one of my new favorite cities to party in...) and I am a bit
distressed. Although the flyer looks tight and the line-up is close to unreal,
I have doubts about going to the party. Lemme tell you why....at
FuckTheSystem, *three* different kids came up to me on *three* separate
occasions and warned me against going to this party because of the promoter.
Apparently, this promoter is not too well-liked in Detroit by many kids. One
kid in particular told me that the promoter in question works along with the
police to get his parties busted early, right before major headliners are
supposed to come on. Now please understand, this is just coming from some
random little raver kid that I met for the first time that night! As we are
all well aware, vicious rumors fly rampant...my question is this: does anyone
have any inside knowledge on this? Anyone know what the truth really is? Now,
I talked to another one of my promter friends here in Cincy, and she assured
me that for all she knew, the promoter of Freaks was a nice guy, and in fact
he got arrested at one of his own parties not too long ago, but she
acknowledged that many Detroit kids do not like this promoter. One kid even
went so far as to tell me that several other promoters in the Detroit area
were organizing a free party that same night to deter from Freaks, and that
his lighting compnay was going to do free lighting because the felt so
strongly about it. 

Now please, like I sid, this could be COMPLETE bullshit, but I just wanted to
know if anyone else had heard anything about this. I would LOVE to go to this
party if it is legit and safe...I'm just not about driving all the way to
Detroit for a shady party that would get busted. 

BUT, if that party goes off...it's promising to be off the hook :)

searching for facts,
HoUsKiTteN

Hey I know this isn't the best place to ask (so don't flame me)but I'm 
going to be in Detroit tomorrow nite and was wondering if anybody knows 
a good place to go.

The last time I was there, Alvin's (Family Funktion), was pretty cool on 
a Wednesday. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks...

so....after being mia for a week and then going directly to the party i came
home to find 507 messages i cried for about two days and here is my
review.....dope.  i was exhausted and really couldnt keep up with the
music....but i was quite happy to just stand there and let the bomb sounds of
the uk hit me...and go nuts with the wistle and lighter....the only down side
for me was that  it seemed like they gave Americans no respect...i mean two
plays of shadow boxing and brown paper bag???? good toons but still twice in
one night?????? oh well stilll a great party...shouts out to the rsp crew,
dapwez, and everybody else i bumped into...spike sorry what happened brother?
oh well im out like buster douglas

oh oh oh boys and girls, can i just say that i finally must admit that i had
the bessst roll of my entire life at phorm ... in case you haven't noticed,
i've never been to keen about announcing my substance prefereces in this
forum, but ... really, it's beyond anything in the english language anyways...
the alien-literate might understand what i'm talking about?

my weekend didn't end until i finally woke up this afternoon ... and i got
lots to say, but right now can i just sum it up like this:

OHHHHHHH SHIT.

luv luv luv
spyboy

ps one more thing ... i didn't get to truly experience the party itself -
dancing and meeting allyall had to take a backseat to quality bondage time
with a few individuals, but it's not something i regret in any way.  so i
gotta send MAD MAD MAD luv to those kids: alethea, lerone, amber, rachel,
chojin, seth, and the kids in the corner who shared my best hand-holding, toe-
biting, finger-twisting, bear-hugging, indian-burning, vapo-rubbing, lip-
kissing, vibrator-on-my-booty spooning session ever ... these boys and girls
really made my summer.

First of all this is matt the one that did not write the message!

pHryl and I would like to apoligize to system and everyone else that the
email offended.  We did not know John was going to send that message (I
wouldv'e crashed my computer if I had to, in order to have him not send
that).  i hate drama.  I try and stay on good terms with everyone.  
We did hear that rumor about the questions and John felt it necessary to
post it.  If it were any other kid he wouldv'e just been thought of as
looking out for someone.  But as a promoter that is something that should
not have been done!  Once again i apoligize.  Just to let you know I am
still very bitter with John about this whole ordeal.

A thousand apoligizies,
Matthew

I'm sorry, but I refuse to believe that teknova was maliciously
posting that to get ppl to go to phorm instead of FTS.  Some reasons:
1)  Teknova seemed like great people who wouldn't want to do that to
another promtoer.
2)  Phorm was in NO danger of not having enough people, so they would
have no need to steal ppl from FTS.  they knew it was going to sell
out, so why would they want more ppl to show up?
3)  They were prob. just informed that from somebody else and passing
along info to help people from possibly avoiding a scam.  Seems like a
decent thing to do to me.

I heard numerous rumors (WELL before john's post) about the validity of the
free admission to the party in detroit, from sources in detroit, as well as
those in ohio, so I know that Teknova John and Matt weren't making anything
up.  As any of you should know, most information that doesn't come directly
from the source of the promoter should be taken lightly, and as an opinion or
belief, and not as fact.  Drama occurs on this last way more than necessary
for this simple reason

Wow!  Phorm was the bomb!  I still cant get over all the great music
and people at this party.  Shy FX and SS were my two personal favorite
acts followed closely by Dieselboy.  I'm not usually to excited about
mcs, but Warren G was really good.  The vibe on the dance floor was
great especially during the net meet.  Everyone was soooo nice and
seemed to be having just as much of a party as I was.  I have a really
hard time remebering names, so I wont name anyone for fear of leaving
others out.  I do want to send out a big thank you to everyone tho!  I
had such a good time!

I gotta give Dave props for holding that sign up for so long.  At one
point I said "boy you must be gettin tiard of holding that sign up for
so long!"  And he said "I'm goin down before this sign does!"  I luv
that determination!  Also, thank you Andy for letting Frankie G,
Absolut, Seth Crazy Baum and I crash at your crib afterwards.  That
movie "mother's day" was so cut-up!  

Thanx all for the great time!
much luv,
Josh 

ps.  Shoutz out to all that received back massages from the crazy back
massager thing!

Hi all:-)

I made it to Phorm at 12:30 am.........plopped down against a wall and the
next time I looked at my watch it was 3 am:-(   I missed our meet.  Did anyone
happen to see me?  (the old lady:-) ?)  I was passing out Blow Pops all night.
Anyone going to Liquid on Sept 5th???  Maybe I could try this again!?!?!

   Well ok its not really a party.  But the band MACE are making their
re-debut 2nite at Laga (scj on an off week hehe)  They have a phat new
cutie female lead singer nad hear are getting into some more
sampling/trip-hop/jungly kinda sounds.  They start at 8 doing a 30 mins
set or so before Jack off Jill and Psychotica two gothy bands.  So if you
have nothing better to do 2nite or know some old fanz of MACE get the word
out.  Its nice to see a local band going out on the edge a little. (Guess
thats why they dont't play mkt. sq)
  And of course The Pollinator above the beehive with dj -brian and dj
freeze aftawardz. (Plus his much talked about CD mixer :) )
Have a good one kidz and again thanks to all for making Phorm such a bomb
ass party!
hmmm CyberNature w/ Sasha anyone? (email me)

And anybody who shows up with a ticket stub from the MACE / JOJ /
Psychotica show will get in with no cover charge.

Suckily, it's still 21+.  =(

okay, i guess i'm gonna have to say that i had a really good fucking time
at PHORM.  There is no particular reason that i can pin point either.  It
was just good clean fun that even MOM would approve of =) tee hee.  I
think it actually had to do more with the people i ended up going with
than anything,though.  There was no drama and there was no bullshit. We
just went to have a good time and enjoy each other's company. 

Of course meeting some of the netheadz was a plus...Josh, Amanda, and
anyone else i forgot (i was the kid in the cure t shirt with soooo much
glittr on my face that i looked like a 70's version of the Tin Man=) and
of course the music was excellent.  I've been wanting to see ShyFX for a
long ass time, and i can easily say that the goodz were provided.
HRMmmm...yeah...and i think that is all this little candykid has to say
for right now.  I still haven't slept more then a wink since sat. so my
mind is a weeeeee bit scattered.  Hope to see y'all at LiQuId.

<< pHryl and I would like to apoligize to system and everyone else that the
 email offended.  We did not know John was going to send that message (I
 wouldv'e crashed my computer if I had to, in order to have him not send
 that).  i hate drama.  I try and stay on good terms with everyone.  
 We did hear that rumor about the questions and John felt it necessary to
 post it.  If it were any other kid he wouldv'e just been thought of as
 looking out for someone.  But as a promoter that is something that should
 not have been done!  Once again i apoligize.  Just to let you know I am
 still very bitter with John about this whole ordeal.
 
 A thousand apoligizies,

hold on a sec.  Weren't you the one who REPOSTED and REAFFIRMED the message
that your partner posted?  I am almost positive of this.  if I remember right
you said, "In case you haven't heard, the party in detroit is not free. there
are 3 questions you have to answer..."  Correct me if I am wrong, but i am
pretty sure this was posted in addition to BIG Johns post.  Still wrong if you
ask me.

<< I heard numerous rumors (WELL before john's post) about the validity of the
 free admission to the party in detroit, from sources in detroit, as well as
 those in ohio, so I know that Teknova John and Matt weren't making anything
 up.  As any of you should know, most information that doesn't come directly
 from the source of the promoter should be taken lightly, and as an opinion or
 belief, and not as fact.  Drama occurs on this last way more than necessary
 for this simple reason
 
 Lou
  >>

This is all well and good. However, the post did not say "I heard a rumer that
the party in Detroit was not free..." the post said "Attention. The party iin
detroit IS NOT FREE!"   If it was a rumer that this person heard, express it
as such.  I am not creating Drama, just expressing my opinion.

Just tryin' to get your attention:
Ok, my computer crashed before as I was just finishing up this post,
so I'll try and make this shorter than it was before (that doesn't
mean it'll be short tho :):

FIRST OFF: THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST PARTIES I'VE EVER BEEN TO. 
ABSOLUT-LY INCREDIBLE.  GOOD JOB EVERYBODY INVOLVED.

MUSIC:
[mainroom]
dj^2: he started off with some jazzy rollers before sleepy-c arrived.
good stuff.
sleepy-c: pretty damn good . . . lot's of tribal drums.  One song was
only a four to the floor beat with the most insane computer generated
congas you've ever heard.
dieselboy: like everybody said, this set was much better than SCJ. 
"Stomp" got the rewind, and dieselboy does not give that often let
alone without an MC, so that shows you what the crowd reaction was
like.  His mixing was incredible, and as always hoards of people were
looking on as he worked the decks.
shy fx: Great selections, odd mixing, and bad attitude just about sums
it up.  His tracks were superb.  His mixing didn't involve too much
actual mixing, but a lot of dropping the song at the break (which
worked pretty well dancefloorwise).  But his attitude really pissed me
off.  He stood up there and just had this nasty look on his face the
entire time, like he couldn't stand anybody, and he was the best thing
that ever walked into this club.  He just looked swole/pissed the
whole time, and it never let up.
ss: Best set of the night by far, everything was on point perfectly. 
Everything that is except his attitude.  He didn't have AS much of a
scowl on his face as shy fx, but he would walk around the club barely
aknowledging anybody else's existence.  I tried to tell him that I
loved his stuff, and he just kind of nodded and walked away.  Whatever
. . . he threw down, and he didn't need to exude any energy to get the
dancefloor moving.
john b: Good as well, but with some obvious screw-ups.  He played alot
of his own tracks that are just great, like starburst, brazil etc.
etc.  Very good performance in all.
warren g: great MCing . . . not too much not too little . . . just
right.  I didn't realize before that his voice was the one that the
VIP dubplate business sample's taken off of . . . but it is!  He was
the one UK guy that really cam across as being nice, caring about the
fans and really giving a shit.  He shook my hand and I gave him a CD
of ours and he just seemed cool.
barada & christian smith: hmmm . . . i wasn't impressed.  It was just
kind of mellow slow house.  It was nice though.

[secondroom]
dj^2: more of a techy set that he played after he got kicked off the
main system when sleepy-c arrived.  Technicaly nice, but not quite
dancefloor friendly enough for the first set of the night.
(whole bunch of people missing)
7-up: I wasn't in this room from 12-6, but when I came in at 6 or so,
he had the place jumpin with some high energy house.  The vibe was
ALMOST as thick as the air in that room :)

VIBE:
Although many people seemd to think the vibe was incredible . . . I
had mixed feelings.  When the net-meet was in full swing the vibe was
off the meter insanely good.  but at other times I just felt this lack
of vibe.  this lack of unity between the cleveland heads.  I didn't
see people greating people with big hugs or large groups of heads just
letting loose and being crazy. It seemed more restricted and solo . .
. def. not a pgh vibe, but not a bad vibe either . . . more of a lack
of a vibe.  At first I thought it was just me too, but then Geoff
practicaly read my mind, and said exactly what I was thinking, so I
knew I couldn't be too out of it.  One thing was though, that the
party got started soon.  By 11:00 there was a packed dancefloor, and
there was a steady stream of people.  why doesn't this happen in pgh?

DANCING:
I couldn't stop myself from dancing from the time shy fx came on
untill the time john b stopped . . . and I was dancing for most of
dieselboy's set too.  An incredible experience.  The sets flowed
together so well, and everything just went great.  I'm afraid that I
didn't get to meet as many people as I would have liked to just
because I secluded myself so much by dancing the whole time . . . but
the music always comes first.

PEOPLE/SHOUT OUTS (is it shout outS or shoutS out?):
The reflective vest I was wearing really helped other net people to
find me . . . I'll prob. be wearing it in the future.
"KATE": write me an e-mail . . . i didn't get a chance to talk to you
much there, but you stopped me because of the vest, and we talked
briefly.
J-Brick: I love the "pumpkin camo"!
Braden: Nice to finaly meet you, glad you had such a great time.
Amanda and Ellis Dees: Wassup?
A guy with blonde hair that stopped me because of the vest: who are you?
JESUS:  I know everybody else has written about this, but I gotta put
my two cents in.  This guy held that fucking sign up forever!  I saw
him at the begining of the net meet, and then after a while the
commotion calmed down and I got back to dancing.  Then I happened to
look back like two hours later and he was still just as siced and
holding that sign just as high!!  BIG UP YA CHEST!
Andy the pooh: thanx for letting us crash . . .
benny haha: too bad you're movin' to cleveland . . . 

And of course the usual suspects: da RSP, xspyboy, tom, geoff, casey,
dapwezz, don, geekboy, etc etc you know who you are.

OH YEAH: big up viktor for running around with that blue light!  That
was awesome, and you really got the crowd going.

see you next time,

absolut

ps-one of my favorite conversations: 
	"Is there anywhere in clevelend that isn't ghetto?"
	"hmmmmmmmmmmmm . . . nope."
pps-hopefully by the next major event I'll have a laser pointer with
12!!! different attachment :)

Hi, every1;

I too will be upstairs in the bar on Thursday night at Metropol (the 
Danes call it "Atomic"), and the same rules as Hossam originally stated 
apply for me as well, except you'll have to buy my 'nutz-in-yo-mouf'.  
Don't really get me wrong, I've enjoyed plenty of midori sours in my 
day, but I truly prefer my 'nuts-in-yo-mouf'.

woo-Hooooooowh!

-colby

so you had this empty feeling after reading all those phorm posts and
you weren't quite sure what it was, right? that's cause i haven't gone
on for about 5 kb's of text about my bizarre take on everything yet,
but now its time to let the madness roll...                           
 :)

so this was my (and the entire RSP's) first cleeveland rave and i
would have to say it was a good one. i wont go into the space, cause
it seems like everyone knew that place inside out like a muthafucka
cause they had been there weekly for the last coupla years.

the music was supergroovycool. unlike most of the other folks who
reviewed, i thought sleepy c was pretty poop. dieselboy rocked it out
with the rolllllllin selection, and ended on the hard tip with test 2a
by da 1 like dillinja (which is my shit of tha week :)  - that was his
second track that got a rewind... the crowd was mad hyped as dieselboy
stepped off the decks and shy fx and the warren g started droppin
craz-e bombs on the dancefloor. now, if you are a junglist, you gotta
love shy fx. he's just the shit - he's written some generally
important tunes over the years, and he's always progressing... but in
england, he's not a very big dj (mainly just a producer). i think this
is what gave him his "i'm playin for the us crowd" sound, cause he
didn't really have the super-high-dj-standards that ss has to live up
do, so he just rinsed out track after track that would hype the crowd
- and he did a fuckin great job (minus a dodgy mix of 2, but
whateverman). about 20 minutes into the set (when the dancefloor vibe
was crazy large) someone busts out a "pb-cle" sign about 6 feet in
front of me and the dancefloor goes crazy!!!!! people start being
crazily enthusiastic and jumping up and down blowing whistles and
giving each other hugs. the music was relentless, but there was still
a net-meet (the best net meet i've been to, i think!) people briefly
stopped dancing to give each other super-big-hugs... everyone met
someone new and everyone was really happy, cause this list is gettin
more and more like a bighappyfamily every day. dave (who has my vote
for the most hardcore pb-cle member) held that sign up for i'd say at
least 3 hours. every time i looked behind me, jesus was still in full
effect (big up :). because my vibe was at ALL TIME high (it was my
first uk junglistic x-perience ferchrissake!) and i was really vibin
off the people around me, i really didn't give a shit that only 10% of
the people in the venue cared about the music @ all. man, you shoulda
seen geoff + i flip out when ss rinsed it out with
"d-d-d j-j-j s-s-ssssss-s-s
dub--ppplate--b-b-b-bizzzz-n-n-n-nnnnneess... as we roll with the
soundsofthe..." everyone who knew what was up just flippin out! the
vibe was so fuckin thick it was wild. ss layed down a technically
tight-as-fuck set with KILLER tracks. geoff + i musta been linked
somehow vibe-a-lly cause champion sound hit me like a ton-o-bricks as
well, and we both started runnin around makin crazy-spanish-guy noises
when brazil came on, too :) :) :) :)     <----sorry this above
paragraph doesn't make much sense to non-junglists, but...

thruout shy fx and ss's sets warren g was flowin NICE! he didn't say
much, and VERY occasionally he would bust it with a flow, and his
timing was just supurb. he knows his shit WELL. john b was next, who
threw down a kinda strange set, so the crowd kinda dispersed. warren g
kinda yelled @ the crowd, askin em why they came to the rave if they
weren't gonna dance (which i thought was pretty funny), but eventually
didn't say much at all during jb's set. the vibe significantly
decreased, but it was still fun as nuts.

the second room looked cool for the 10 minutes total elapsed time that
i was in there for... thanks for the props anyways, suge :)

i also went lookin for the gabber once the vibe started to leave the
main room, but like everyone else - i didnt find it, so i went back to
watch john b rock it.

oh yeah... i got my bag stolen. now i know why they call it
thieveland... that's too bad :(   what's up with spike, andy, + i all
getting out bags stolen? fuck that. it was a shitty situation cause
the nite had been four stars for me, you know - like everything was
fuckin' perfect and then you gotta deal with that bullshit.  ...and i
had a fuzzy green stuffed animal alien guy that i was going to give as
a present to some random happy raver kid, too :(

afterward we headed back to pgh to chill @ the phatandyafterparty
which was all about pullin tubes, watchin' mother's day (horror
flick... 2 thumbs up :), conversin about technology, and talkin about
shit that was "pimp" and "tits" :)

_________________________
SPECIAL SHOUT OUT SECTION
_________________________
hossam - cause you run tings inadejungle :)... jbrick - hehe, that was
me who gave you the rhino... glad you liked it :)... everyone else who
got a stuffed animal - hope you liked em... josh da backrubbin
fiend... amanda for bein right on the same vibe and givin me hugs
every 15 minutes like we hadn't seen each other in years!... everyone
i met and forgot there names (and believe me, there are A LOT of ya
:)... sarah k, benny HAHA, jade33773773, tom, jon, da pwezzident of da
yoooonited states + his homey who i always forget his name, geoff and
the rest of the stamina kru for makin the dancefloor a very fun place,
geekboy and his funky pointing booty dance (sorry you didn't get to
kick it in the cage!), casey (hi!), braden (dammit! everyone else met
you - why didn't i?), the 2 rolls royce massive, phatandy - thanks a
shitload for lettin us chill/crash - much appreciation.... spike -
sorry you couldn't make it! sorry to all i missed (i love you all just
as much :)

about that party - it aint happenin for a while - seth was the main
organizer of it, then he left on vacation and left it in our hands and
we let it fall apart, unfortunately.

so that's the end of my fragmented rambling.

um.

i hope our next camping trip involved goin to hyped in toronto the
weekend before skool starts!

funny how this parallels a current thread on mw.

guys, none of this would ever have been brought up if anybody actually
KNEW jj haws, the primary force behind FUCK THE SYSTEM.  i don't blame
anybody for being new to the scene, or for not knowing jj personally.  but
this kind of disrespect (accidental, or otherwise) is exactly why the rave
scene is sinking like a rock, and QUICK. 

jj haws was one of the midwest's shining examples during his 3 years of
event-coordination from 1992-1995.  if his status were to be judged on the
positive impact of the first INTERSTELLAR OUTBACK (1993) alone, he would
still deserve our utmost respect.  in case you didn't know about that
event, IO was an outdoor event held in kentucky in august of 1993, and it
featured most of the midwest's rising stars.  i myself was hoboing around
the west at the time so i missed it, but by all reports it was a stunning
success...a rave to remember.  and if i recall, it was dirt cheap to get
in, too.

since withdrawing from promotion, jj has continued to represent the best
we have to offer in our scene, with his UNTRANSLATABLE booths, mixtapes,
and merchandising.  with his return to promoting, FUCK THE SYSTEM became
both a rave and a political statement.  how dare anybody question the
"freeness" of this event!  if the flyer said it was free, then it was
free, period.  anybody who knows jj and what he stands for, would never
even question this.  i liken it to somebody shit-talking an ele_mental
party for being too expensive (yes, raping the scene with those $5 and $8
admission prices!). 

nevertheless, i accept teknova's apology at face value (for whatever my
opinion is worth).

but please--and i mean everyone on the list here--let's re-examine where
this scene is headed.  i may personally want little part of it anymore,
but for those of you who care about the scene (or those of you who
actually think it can be "saved"), it's reckoning time. 

sink or swim...

phenomenal to say the least!
i got there just in time to catch the end of sleepy c's set as he busted =

extra-orgasmic sets. there's prolly a dozen reviews before this with =
actual content and dj critiques so i see no reason to bother |P
the vibe wasn't spectacular there, but it was really intense with the =
people i actually interacted with (mostly you net kids).

at 8am managed well enough, though). the only other complaints i had =

phryl has a review of the party ye might wanna check out at =

a little quote from it that i like: "net ravers are often thought of as =

This is how I feel exactly.  JJ is one of the nicest guys in the world.  His

however i just ask one thing from the newer promoters.  Make sure you give
respect where respect is due.

just wanted to let everyone know that, as of yesterday, i'm now settled
into my new home, hopefully for the next four or so years, here at
Carnegie Mellon... i'm having lots of fun meeting new kidz and am loving
my 10-base-t hookup to the net... *grin*  it gives streaming media a
whole new meaning... needless to say, i'm going to be visiting a lot
more techno sound sites... (caugh.. caugh, MP3, *grin*)

anyway, i just wanted to see how many other CMU (or even pitt, or hell,
any greater-oakland area) ravers were out there... i know that jeff,
erica, dave, and matt are on here (from cmu), but is there anybody else?

anyway, if you guys aren't busy, we should all get together some time
this week. i'm pretty free this week. all that i have going on is
orientation and it would be awesome to meet a few new raver kids,
especially from the list.

so, get back to be!! hope to hear from some of ya soon....

*hugz*

peace,

--spike

p.s. i'm glad everybody had fun at phorm! from reading the posts, it
sounds like it, and fuck the system were both awesome parties...  sorry
to all that had there bags taken too... i feel for ya and i know what
that shit's like...

In a message dated 98-08-19 01:24:11 EDT, you write:

<< the post did not say "I heard a rumer that
 the party in Detroit was not free..." the post said "Attention. The party iin
 detroit IS NOT FREE!"   If it was a rumer that this person heard, express it
 as such.  >>

EXACTLY!!!       "John" screwed up by making that post.   From this side of
the monitor it looks pretty shady.   Bullshit rumors hurt everyone because
people may disregard  legitimate information that is posted in the future.

Miami pirate radio bust is largest ever in U.S.

By Harvey Solomon
WASHINGTON D.C. (Variety) - Miami has just set a record, but it's a rather
unenviable one: the city is the site of the FCC's largest shutdown of
unlicensed radio stations ever. 

After ignoring warning letters and visits by agency personnel, 15 broadcast
stations -- mostly dance, techno and rave -- operating illegally in Miami,
Miami Beach, North Miami, Coconut Grove, Davie, Hialeah and Homestead were
shut down in late July. 

Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard praised the effort,
calling it the ``most successful, large-scale enforcement action against
unlicensed operators to date.'' 

Violators face monetary penalties of up to $11,000 per violation, seizure of
all radio equipment and potential criminal fines of up to $100,000 or
imprisonment of up to one year, or both, for first time offenders. 

Equipment seized included homemade transmitting components and illegally
imported professional equipment, including two 2,000 watt transmitters. Such
equipment can potentially cause serious interference to licensed
communications like aviation and other public safety frequency transmissions. 

The FCC has previously estimated that about 100-120 radio stations are
operating illegally in the U.S., with as many as 50 concentrated in Florida.

Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Wed, 19 Aug 1998 16:15:17 PDT
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

Well, what can I say?  I am on the floor after reading this review!!!
I don't even think I am that good!  I am glad about the sound quality of 
the tape, I only receive one report of a complaint, but then again the 
brand I sent out to Hi-Octane probably wasn't the best.  I tried it, now 
I know for real it doesn't work so he gets a new one.

I did send some up to Hypervinyl, but I don't know if anyone bought one. 
There seems to be so many good tapes up there, it sort of was like "WOW!  
LOOK AT THESE CHOICES, HOW CAN YOU CHOOSE?"  Same with everything else 
in Hypervinyl.

It was good to hear this review!  I don't know how good my sets are 
compared to others, but if someone likes them great!!! I always want to 
do a good job.  (Even though Hi-Octane kinda got a poopy tape, but I'll 
fix it!)  

I have an index box just full of addresses and keep track of who got 
what.  I know I will frame the review of REBELGADE!  

Anyway, I received a box from Deadly Buda.  He wants me to put His life 
story into a Book, or some sort of organized way of reading, so in 
payment He gave me His mixer. My name is K., but here is how The Deadly 
One put the message:

"TO KAY!!!  THE MIXER THAT STARTED IT ALL TO PITTSBURGH'S #1 RAVER
--DEADLY BUDA"

After visiting Hypervinyl, the day I dropped off the tapes, I did what I 
used to do when Turbozen ruled, the last flight of stairs I put my 
fingers to my lips, kissed them and touched the stairs.  That is what I 
used to do and will continue to do so.  Then that night I sat with THE 
MIXER.  The room was dark, I had two lantern lights on that I bought for 
myself, and just sat with THE MIXER.  THE MIXER was at Turbozen back in 
the day!  I used to dance in front of THE MIXER like every party Deadly 
Buda was at, and now THE MIXER is sitting in my room!  

When Deadly Buda gave it to me I asked Him to take me immediately to 
Culture Shop, where I bought a covering to place over THE MIXER.  The 
covering has embroidered Gods on it, and looks really nice.  Deadly Buda 
liked that a lot.  I even bought Deadly Buda a lantern.

I gave my tape to Deadly Buda and he liked it a lot.  A lot of the stuff 
on there, he hadn't listened to in awhile, so that was nice.

Well, I can't say enough about the review, I mean I tried so hard, and 
have gone through a lot of money with tapes etc. and this says it was 
sooo worth it.  (Secretly I know it is, but the check book says 
different) but for a review like this, I guess not everyone gets.

To say I am rough and rugged--1/2 of that is true.  You have to put up 
with a lot of expense and still find a way to do it.  You have to have 
nerve to dress like 100% into it and have a Technical difficulty make 
you feel like a failure.  You have to put up with things being in Radio 
Shack for repair, knowing full well YOU NEED TO PRACTICE!!!
You have to put up with no car, sometimes, but depending on where it is, 
your folks may help out.  You have to go through the realization that 
most parties are for FREE and only FREE and exposure is very priceless.  
That is what makes a better advertisement anyway. Parents and some 
friends who are not in the scene won't understand this, and trying to 
explain, well, they don't want to hear it.  They want to see results 
that may come very slowly.  Money wise they think you are a fool and are 
totally wasting your time.

Patience in this practice is never ending.  You don't get to play at all 
the parties, but it doesn't hurt to remind people you exist anyway.  You 
can even say "if so and so won't come I will be there, just let me 
know."  Either way, it is fine, dance or play whatever! 

But there is also another thing, even if you do play a party that says 
they will pay you, you may or may not get paid.  It could be the party 
did not bring enough people in, or that the Promoter was shady.  (Who 
does that remind me of?  Starts with an S.)

I have gone through a lot of interesting times and now expanding the 
addresses every time I see a post on who wants to do a site and they 
need tapes.  

The 1/2 part that isn't true about me being Rough and Rugged, is that 
well, I don't and never will go to a bar and get into a fight, and also 
a lot of nights I have been staying up late, (I love working on the 
computer late at night when everyone is in bed) only to be REALLY DEAD 
the next day!  Also a lot of hot days I have been in a BLOBBY mood you 
know, ooozing about the house, kinda move, then go back to sleep, but I 
really have to break that pattern.  That is why I am seeing a 
chiropractor who is Really Big on Vitamins and stuff.  (It is so good 
that I still can't find work right now.  It takes awhile for everything 
to work, so I am glad I still have some time off.)

I did go back to weightlifting, I really like it, and I feel so good 
after I come out.  It has cooled down considerably so tommorrow I'll 
work out even harder!

I got in touch with Tom Cox, overnighted his tape, I was going out of my 
mind looking for him, but all along he had me in mind!!!  Andy gave me 
his pager nbr., and I tried it forever!  Finally Tom got in contact with 
me and all is good!!!  I sent him my playlist to show it is an hour, and 
I hope for a decent time slot.  If Deadly Buda is not there to see me 
play, then it would be sort of hopeless!  I would feel really sad, but 
we'll see how it all goes!!!

Thanks for the review CAFE 2000 hope to see your Smart Bar soon, 'cause 
I miss those yummy drinks!  

Peace,
DJ K.A.L.I.

Hey, anybody want to buy a laser pointer?  I have one, and I just
bought a new one, so I'm tryin to get rid of my old one.  Here's the
lowdown:

-I don't know the power, but it's pretty similar to most out there.

-it has two attachments you can screw in . . . one makes the dot a
line, one makes it a whole bunch of dots in a circle pattern.  because
of the way it is defrating the laser, it doesn't go as far, but is
still cool.

-it takes lr44 or sr44 watch batteries . . . three at a time.

-the on button is a little funky and doesn't work perfectly, but isn't
really a problem . . .sometimes you just have to press it once or
twice before it turns on.

I'm not trying to sell it for very much, so make me an offer.

stop, drop, and rolllllllllll,

absolut

yahoo is the latest free email place to start bouncing.   30 ppl have
hotmail and 8 have yahoo, and they both keep bouncing for whatever reasons.
 i'm not sure what to do about hotmail and yahoo as far as the list is
concerned, they are causing more headaches than aol at the moment.  i guess
you get what you pay for.

Alright, so I was debating whether or not to review this party, but since
I am always complaining about not getting enough dnb in Cleveland, I
suppose I should. I want to preface this review by giving a sincere thanks
to Viktor, Phil, and the Teknova people although I did not meet them, for
taking the risk and throwing this party. I truly appreciate your efforts
to bring dnb to Cleveland in a proper fashion. 

I had been anticipating this party ever since Viktor dropped me a hint
about it back at the beginning of the summer at Forward in Toronto. In
fact, this party was pretty much set up as the pinnacle of my summer,
with nothing left to look forward to except going back to school. That
being said, I cannot tell you how excited I was for this party: great
lineup and in my own city! Unbelievable! 

Well, the time flew by, and finally, Saturday, it happened. Now maybe I
built this party up to an untouchable ideal, or maybe I am just plain
crazy, but I did not have a phenomenal time like most of the other people
I have talked to on this list, or in general. Don't get me wrong, I had a
really good time, I just didn't have the BLAST that I had worked up in my
head that I would experience.

The most important aspect of the party for me is the music. And
personally, I was not blown away by ShyFX, SS, or John B. ShyFX had a few
crappy mixes, and I noticed that a lot of his mixes weren't even
mixes--they were just cuts over to the next track. SS was the tighest of
the three, and I had the best time dancing during his set. John B's set
was a nice change of pace, especially with Warren G chillin out from the
mic the majority of this time. Although the music was fun, and they played
a lot of tracks that everyone knows and loves, I guess I was expecting
more. I wasn't expecting to hear a bunch of records a few times each
(especially when we have been hearing those records for quite some time
now). (And I cannot tell you how much I detest the salsa song, but what
can I say when John B's on the lineup ;). Aside from the actual techniques
of the djs and the fact that I wasn't terribly impressed with their
selections, I felt that the whole "show" was just that, a cookie-cutter
tour/show. I had been following other reviews on other lists as well as
heard from other people little tricks and special things they were
"supposed" to do, and when those things did in fact happen, I was like,
ugh, how gimmicky, how unoriginal. I felt like all of their sets were
preprogrammed and exactly like (or very similar to) what they had played
in every city of their tour. Maybe that is true, maybe it isn't, but I
didn't think any of the djs conveyed any kind of energy that would
convince me otherwise. Even Warren G wasn't able to entirely hype me up,
although I did appreciate and felt the comment about not thinking they
would get this kind of response in Cleveland of all places, because in all
honesty I myself was very pleasantly surprised by all the people having
such a great time, all the whistles, lighters, screaming, etc... =D

In any case, I tried my hardest to have a good time, and I did have a
really good time, just not the BEST time in my life, like I am hearing
from tons of other people. And please don't think I am trying to bring
anyone's good time down. I am just relating my personal, subjective
experience--my opinion. Since Sunday, I have been trying to think of all
the illegitimate excuses why I might not have had a good time: the space,
my earplugs were annoying me, I was in a funky mood during the day, tired,
whatever...but I guess it doesn't really matter. I got my money's worth, I
got to dance for a long time to my favorite kind of music, I got to hang
out with a bunch of really, really wicked people all weekend long, and I
finally succeeded in getting my best friend of 10 years to finally go to
her first rave! (She loved it, by the way). That alone made my night.

Thanks again to Phryl and Teknova for providing such a good time to so
many people, including myself and my friends. 

Oh, and BIG UP THE LEFT FRONT SPEAKER MASSIF


Kate






PS - This is just a warning for people with pants big enough for OTHERS to
trip over: please please please, don't bring fire hazards to parties; I
almost killed myself tripping over someone else's pants on Saturday! And,
no, I'm not kidding =P

I don't know about Pittsburgh on Saturdays, but I'm going to that folk
festival-- Joan Baez and Nanci Griffith, right? I guess I'd see you there
if I knew who you were...

I know I always write crazy posts.  ALWAYS drama!!  I can't help it, 
ya-know.  

Thats why my name is BENNY'HA HA. 
anyway my story today is not about raves at all.  Its about me doing a 
huge mural thing all by myself right before I leave for school in 3 
days. 
Sucky facts....
#1 There is no way I will get it done. I am painting a whole room by 
myself I just started yesterday. 

#2 The place where I am painting is inside.  There is no venilation and 
I am using oil paint so right now I am very, very dizzy.  NO BRAIN 
CELLS, no brain cells, no brain cells the walls are screaming at me! MY 
eyes keep falling back, deeper.  This cannot be good!?!

#3 I have been painting for 12 hrs.
Remember my last post awhile back about my driving experience well I 
feel worse.  I could not drive home worth crap this evening. I kept 
seeing flashing lights red & blue lights as if I were having a flash 
back of that experience

#4 My ex boy and his girlfriend were there watching me.  Urgh....
And to top it off I look like sh*$!  

#5 This place is worse than any rave (compared in temp). You don't have 
to dance or move to feel faint, turn red or to sweat perfusely(can't 
spell).  The masks weren't happening tonight.

I really need to sleep it off, spin my way into unconsciousness..

Dave Coulier...wasn't he on that show on Nickelodeon way back when?  You

Okay, I've been TRYING to send Phorm reviews since Monday, and none of
them have posted.  Sometimes my Hotmail account is so dead that it
won't let me log on, other times I can get on, but I don't get
messages.  So, I got this Yahoo account -- and it sucks too.  Just my
luck.  I can't get on it from Explorer, only Netscape, which means I
can't check mail while I'm at work.  Oh, and the messages go backwards
-- from most recent to least recent, which I thought I had fixed, but
it didn't stick.  Sucks sucks sucks.  (And I refuse to post from my
school account, since that would involve showing off my last name
right next to where I go to school.)

Anyway...

I'm not even going to bother with a real Phorm review now, because
it's Thursday and pretty much everything I was going to say has been
said already.  I just want to throw in that 1. I am not a jungle fan,
yet still found myself going nuts dancing to jungle, and 2. Those of
you who I had the pleasure of finally meeting made my night.  I felt
like I was a part of some huge, elite, hard-ass group.  Thanks guys!

sup everyone... i needed to kill some time @ work so i scanned the net
meet picture that spike let me borrow @ i.g.c. and put it up on the
web. i put a letter on everyone and i wrote in the names that i knew
below. please help me fill in the blanks. 

todd + i have been thinkin that it would be cool to have a webpage
with a picture of every person on the list, so you could try to match
names with faces when you AREN'T at a rave trying to figure out what
the fuck people are saying over the music while rollin your face off
:)  i guess this is a good start.

http://136.142.104.123/netmeet.html

trouty... feel free to grab the filez and put em up on the pb-cle page

much love...
...frankie g

I had to go to the airport, I let John use my computer for an hour.  I just
got him on the system and showed him how to send posts.  When I get back
from the party I read it and flipped.  needless to say he will not be
sending anymore messages.

i did not say anything about it.  My name was on the message (I think, but
I did not type it). I heard the rumor but I knew if a promoter said it, it
would be considered shady.

In a message dated 98-08-20 12:09:59 EDT, you write:

<< Anyway...  I'm not even going to bother with a real Phorm review now,
because
 it's Thursday and pretty much everything I was going to say has been
 said already.  I just want to throw in that 1. I am not a jungle fan,
 yet still found myself going nuts dancing to jungle, and 2. Those of
 you who I had the pleasure of finally meeting made my night.  I felt
 like I was a part of some huge, elite, hard-ass group.  Thanks guys!
--Amanda >>

Very well put, Amanda. I am also very sorry I didnt post something about Phorm
before now. I have been so busy at work, blah, blah, blah. Everyone has been
so very proficient in detailing the night, that I really dont have a whole lot
to say either, except what Amanda here has said about jungle and meeting
people, though I had met MOST of you before. I love hanging out with most of
you, and I DO feel like we have sort of a little Partridge Family thing going,
actually its more like a hippie commune of sorts (which I grew up in until I
was 14, so I know what its like), and I love it!! Doesnt seem to matter that I
sometimes go several weeks without seeing most of you, we seem to pick things
right back up where we left off the last time!  And I have never had such
*great hugs* as I get when I see all of you. ;-) Well some people are afraid
of posting the names of the people they saw, but I am not... I may forget
some, but these are the ones that still stick in my memory after five days:
Amanda (great finally meeting you!), Geekboy, Brian Reynard, Dave (Messiah
boy), Jade (candy-girl), Matt/Ratfink, Matt/Teknova (great to meet you, and
great job on everything), Steve (thanks ;-), Frankie G. (ok, so you DONT wear
a hat:-), Todd/Absolut (nice haircut), Danielle, Ken, Hossam (thanks for the
tick, boyee), Tom Cox (nice hair also ;-), Kolbi, Benny, Aaron (great to see
you again), Leon (glad to see that old bike helmet), Braden, David/Xspyboy,
David/Schwanke, Jeff, Lou, Viktor (thank you so much for such a wonderful
time) and Ron ;-). Quite the list, wasnt it? But I do actually remember all of
you. Well, I think the next event I am going to is Clockwork, on Sunday, the
6th at the Red Zone in Columbus (look for the flyer!)...gonna take it easy for
awhile. But I miss all of you already... I had a great time, and I hope to see
you all soon. Love, Casey
P.S. Can anyone help me out with something? I have had two job offers to teach
near San Jose and San Francisco in the last few days,,,what is the cost of
living there compared with Ohio? Anyone have any idea? Thanks...

i'm gonna do a 'ditto' to this....this is the first night i've even had a
chance to attempt at catching up to e-mials which i'm o-so good at
collecting....
but i definatly have to say i've never gotten into jungle as much as i did at
phorm, ..the second room was hot, and blissful...and i have no real opinion on
the third room because i spent almost no time in there.........and 'hi' to all
you kiddies that i ran into.....names are basically pointless anymore...but
anyway...it was a great party and thanks to teknova (it was nice to meet you
matt)  and phryl ....

(and piglet was stolen
...so no side kick *sob*)

It makes me cry to think that since the age of 12 I so wanted to be in 
the scene.  But I was only 12 and the scene was mainly new york city. 
And i did not get into it until I was 16 or 17.  Why, why,why.........

Before I go, I must bring forth a thought that has been lingering in my 
mind for like 3 months. A rave right, a rave at Sandcastle waterpark in 
Homestead. After it shuts down and the water is drained, it would kick 
ass. I have been dreaming this for too long.  See I worked there, today 
was my last day. I was even thinkin' of names and back-up plans to use 
warehouses nearby or under the bridge.  Look at all the parking that 
area has to offer. Hmmm...and I wonder what it would cost or if it could 
be done another way. Maybe if I get the courage I can set up this baby.  
What does anybody else think?

wow, that's my area.  i live across the river and over that hill (pretend
you are sitting on a sandcastle loungechair).  that whole area (mon
river/vacant homestead industrial parks) is prime rave location.  how
would you gain access to the park?  do you know something?  

you could have it in the parking lot if park-access fails.  if you venture
further down the river (away from the city) there is one HUGE LOT of land
that is going to be classified residential and/or commercial (you would
have to work fast before they build).  if you go the other way down the
river....[i'm excited], you have an abandoned AMOCO oil storage-stack
field.  there used to be tanks of oil just restin there.  the place is
prime because it is somewhat near a bridge, there is nothing around it
(minus a rowhouse, but it would probably sound like someone tapping
lightly on a window to them).  to further the techno/industry feel, as you
glance across the river as you dance you can see downtown and an abandoned
steel mill that still has night lights in the same picture.  this would be
great on a cold mid-december to mid-january evening.

good luck...is it time for a pb-cle community "thrown" rave?  we could do
theas!

I have a similar idea.  When I used to work at Kennywood a few years 
ago, about 3 or 4 times out of the year, after the park closed, the 
employees would gather in the groves behind the Jackrabbit and have kick 
ass parties!  The picnic grove we normally used had 2 levels.  The upper 
level was normally the dance floor and DJ booth.  The lower was for food 
'n' stuph.  They might go for a party of non-employees, I'm not sure, 
but I'm sure if the right people were contacted (which I know 
personally) they'd go for it. :)  This is just an idea, I've never 
actually put together one of these before, but if anyone's interested, 
I'd love to help make this thing into a reality.  Lemme know if anyone's 
interested.  
Also, Andy, I could probably talk to some peoples for ya to get access 
to the park after hours.  We used to have the same kinda parties there  
when I worked at Sandcastle. :)  TTYL! :)

wow, that's my area.  i live across the river and over that hill 
(pretend
you are sitting on a sandcastle loungechair).  that whole area (mon
river/vacant homestead industrial parks) is prime rave location.  how
would you gain access to the park?  do you know something?  

you could have it in the parking lot if park-access fails.  if you 
venture
further down the river (away from the city) there is one HUGE LOT of 
land
that is going to be classified residential and/or commercial (you would
have to work fast before they build).  if you go the other way down the
river....[i'm excited], you have an abandoned AMOCO oil storage-stack
field.  there used to be tanks of oil just restin there.  the place is
prime because it is somewhat near a bridge, there is nothing around it
(minus a rowhouse, but it would probably sound like someone tapping
lightly on a window to them).  to further the techno/industry feel, as 
you
glance across the river as you dance you can see downtown and an 
abandoned
steel mill that still has night lights in the same picture.  this would 
be
great on a cold mid-december to mid-january evening.

good luck...is it time for a pb-cle community "thrown" rave?  we could 
do
theas!

I worked there on the stage(river plex) and inquired about that a year or so
ago and got told of the noise violations they are facing now .
there are houses on the other side of the river and they make a habit of
complaining about concerts I hate to think of the complaints from an all
night party.
all though it would be fun :)

i forgot to mention 2 things:

1) it was really funny to see shy fx and dj ss go out onto the
dancefloor as soon as john b went on for the sole purpose of pickin up
some girlies... they were standin there and wouldn't acknowledge
anyone except for good looking girlies to whom they would give the
english version of "the look". hehehehehee.

2) warren g led a brief tribute to stevie hyper d:
"junglists are you reEaAdy?"
"aaaahhh... lordhavemercy-i"
for those that dont know... stevie hyper d was a jungle mc from the uk
who kicked major ass that died recently of a heart attack.

Well I was all fired up to enjoy the Detroit scene, on a Wednesday 
(arguably not the best night-out of the week) and ended up sorely 
dissappointed.

I read the Detroit Metro, a weekly free newspaper, and was pleased to 
find four venues nominally spinning either house, techno or jungle. As 
it happens NONE of these places delivered.

Alvin's advertised house and funk. I'd been there before on a Wednesday 
and it had been fun. Well we arrived their and it was closed! The next 
stop was Magic Sticks advertising techno and jungle At the door we heard 
this awful gothic music. We asked the bouncer if any form of dance music 
was to be played and he guffawed explaining that house music scene had 
died out a long time ago in Detroit. I told him what I thought of his 
opinion and left. Next stop Bo's Loft in Pontiac. We phoned ahead and 
were informed that (although an ad appeared in Detriot Metro announcing 
2 house DJ's on Wed 19 Aug) the loft was closed. 

The woman pointed us in the direction of Cargo Clutch in Pontiac where a 
party called Equation was on the go. Nice venue - big club, three dance 
floor playing mainstream house, hip-hop, and jungle. But the place was 
FULL of frat boys and sorrority girls and had an awful meat-market type 
vibe going down. The dancefloor was full of people doing nothing else 
but grinding. It was awful. 

The point of this rant is (1)

The point of this rant is (1) don't read the Detroit Metro paper. It's a 
rag. If they can't even tell you what's on - what's the point.

(2) It made me realize what a good thing we have going with all the cool 
kids and dope events going down in the pb-cle...and the local scene 
should be nurtured.

I've always tons of respect for the Detroit scene - guys like Derrick 
May, Carl Craig, Moody Man etc. so I hope next time I find myself up 
there - I'll have a better experience of the city.

This seems like a pretty personal message that really has nothing to do 
with anyone else on the list.  Do you think we could keep messages like 
this off the list?  It's a little annoying.

Again, I don't think it's necessary for this post to be on the list.  If 
it's not about the scene then why is it?  Maybe they have a 'mural 
painting/no brain cell/ex-boyfriend with new girlfriend' chat room you 
can find to talk about this stuff.  Most of us are on this list to 
exchange information about the pgh/cle scene, so please stop wasting our 
time.

Today at 2pm on Beta Lounge (http://www.betalounge.com) the first episode
of the new television show Freak City will be webcast live on the Net.

This week's show will feature a club profile on San Francisco's Spundae and
will include an interview with DJ's Sasha and John Digweed from their
recent appearance there. There will also be features on the Hardcore Techno
scene, the Ibiza party scene and a rundown of notable upcoming parties and
new record releases. Upcoming shows will feature world-premiere music
videos from the likes of Massive Attack, Crystal Method and Aphex Twin.

Freak City will also be airing bi-monthly on local TV in 16 cities around
the country. I'll email out local info info when it becomes available.

Cheers,
chris

Your whining about the other post (without trimming it) is even
more a waste of space. If someone on the list wants to write about
their day, nothing forces you to read it.

Well, it doesnt look as though I will be making it out tonight (unless I get a
sudden urge to leave the house in a few minutes here, and just go)...my
boyfriend's mother is in town from Tampa for a wedding we all have to attend
tomorrow, and I am kind of expected to hang around here tonight as well. ;-(
I would have liked to see you all again, but I guess its not going to happen
this weekend. So everyone out there...have a great time... Phreak Show appears
to be at the Whiskey/Smart Bar/Aquilon/The Lift tonight, so be careful with
your cars (my brother and I have had our cars broken into about five times,
respectively). I was going to come out also to hand out Clockwork flyers, but
I think I will hand them out next weekend somewhere. If you want one before
then, I will be dropping them at various record stores (Fame, Bent Crayon,
Grand Poo-bas, Record Exchange, Record Revolution, and Platter Puss) and
coffee shops (Arabica, The Red Star, Caribou) tomorrow and Sunday. I am
planning to do a net meet for Clockwork, so I hope not TOO many of you are
heading anyplace else that night!  Welp, signing off for now... Be safe and
have fun ...talk to you all soon! -Casey-

Since there's like a 5% chance I *might* go tonight, how much is this
party?  I think the price is going to be the deciding factor ...

Also, could someone send me the infoline?

     sorry, but i think this attitude is inappropriate
     for this list. granted, the post was off-topic.
     but it's not as if that's a rare occurrence or 
     anything. if you have a problem with one of the
     list-member's posting habits it would be more 
     appropriate to take it to personal email.

     this list is for ravers. not just promoters, DJs,
     or whatever, but for everyone. if the S/N ratio
     leaves a little to be desired at times, please
     try and remember why we are here. i certainly hope
     it's not only to 'discuss the scene'.

     PLUR?

now sounds like a good time to run trhu the guidelines that i use--
its for talking about parties and socializing a bit on the .net (as much as
you can)
i dont like spam or outside solicitations on here.  j's from san fran
looking for bookings, glowstick sales, dj jow blo in england trying to sell
his "new, wack mixtape", you know that sort of thing, coz if i let it
happen this list will turn into a free for all flea market, i really dont
want to see that happen, there are MANY www.sites that sell mix tapes so i
dont feel bad at all about keeping the list closed that way.
promoters only need post once for their events, then it usually ends up on
the rom if its in the area.  more often is by my definitions spam(like).
i dont say much about off topic stuff unless it gets out of hand.  flame
wars are fun to watch for a little while but bad for the list as a whole.
its a relatively low-traffic list (try mw-raves for more traffic!) so we
can get away with a little extraneous email here and there.

Well, me and Frankie headed down to youngstown to check out Wierd
Science.

All in all it was a fun night except for one thing: the party got shut
down at 4:00 because somebody got "busted" walking across the steet
because of curfew laws.  Don't ask me what kind of curfew it is, or
why that had anything to do with the contiuation of the party, but
whatever.

But other than that it was a lot of fun.  The bar it was in had a
whole bunch of "locals" at it, just because they wanted to drink beer
etc.  So those people were quite shocked, and as you may well imagine,
not very friendly either.  There was one guy who walked around all
night poking at people's backpacks and saying, "Are you sleeping over
or something?"  or "Are you going on vacation?"  It was stupid.  Then
there were the people who were asking the DJ (dj squared at the
time)"Do you have any COUNTY music?"  Then there were the hick owners
working the door who were just complete bitches.  Whatever.

The music was pretty good.  When we got there Deep Blue was playing in
the second room.  This guy is TALL he's gotta be like almost 7 foot. 
And in the main room "darius" was playing.  This dude was siced, and
was generaly excited that he was DJing and shit.  He had "Darius"
written on his car super ghetto style :)  Then DJ^2 came on in the
second room, and he did a good job.  Lotta techy jungle.  And Ian
Morianni (or something like that) came on in the first room (which was
waaay to smokey and it hurt your eyes).  He played pretty much just
trance, and did a good job too.  Then Hazey came on in the main room. 
His scratching is getting better, and is pretty good . . . but his
selection, mixing, and flow of set needed some work.  At this point,
TIK-TAK and KEVIN CUNNINGHAM! started playing in the second room. 
they just showed up cause there were open turntables and they like
spinning . . . we need more ppl like that.  But they brought their own
vestax pimped out mixer and I'm sure their own needles, and they
completely tore it up.  K. cunningham was rocking some of the best
scratching I've ever seen live.  Doing the crrrab and all sorts of
other rough tricks.  Their selection was superb too.  Kind of techy
jump up.  Obviously I was disappointed when at 4:00 about an hour
after they started playing, it got shut down.  Everybody just kind of
milled around inside, and then outside, and then they finally made it
to their cars.

Well, big up all the pb-cle in the place . . . you know who you are.

stop, drop, and roll,

absolut

I was thinking (no, it doesnt hurt).  Seems there are two major 
contigincies of views of what this list represents.
One being that the list is for the pb-cle-raves and things related only to 
raving. Reviews. Rides, music, etc. This one feels cut and dry to me. When 
you read you are just reading random names, when you post you are 'one of 
the masses'. This is a fine way to handle things, many lists are like this. 
But it doesnt seem to quite fit what I think is one of major positive 
aspects of the rave scene, community and friendship.

Little rantish here.
The other is the pb-cle raving community.  The community seems to have 
become much more close knit in the time that I have been active in reading 
it.  May have been closer knit before then, but my impression was that it 
was VERY low volume until we started getting hard on netmeeting and such. 
 We are starting to feel like a family I think. We know each other in real 
life, we know each other in email.  We ask each other 'whatever happened to 
so and so i havnt heard from him in a long time'. We have our rumors, we 
have our secrets. At times we act a little cliqish but I think in our 
hearts we are always looking to accepting new members. I know when it comes 
to netmeets im a little shy considering I dont wanna look like an ass and 
half to explain what a net-meet is all the time. (Alright, so im not a 
proud geek, but ill admit im geek :) I know for some of us its a mild 
ego/acceptance trip. But damn, it does feel good to go to a party and 
realize you know a good portion of the crowd not just by face but by name 
and personal. Knowing people out of state that you cant quite visit 
'whenever' but still consider friends.  Yah, the community aspect is a good 
thing. But as a result we are also getting much more 'friendly' on the 
list. Almost treating it like a chat room/irc channel.  Announcing little 
tidbits about ourselves. Moving out of the scene into real life not 
directly scene related happenings. (If I throw a regular non-rave party I 
would post it to the list because so many people on the list are friends of 
mine and it would be eaiser PLUS I like the list members in general and 
would enjoy their company as well) Look at some of the birthday parties, 
they only 'turned rave' because there were dj's. Projecthouse was not a 
'rave' by the typical definition but it was a blast and definitly scene 
related. How many 'raves' have you been to that had zero fees, no promotor, 
no specialized sound/light (no guest list :) and potlucked grilled to boot! 
To me *THAT* is what the scene should be about, the friendly get togethers. 
 Fellow men and women helping each other.  Variety of races, variety of 
ages, no real gender issues.  I like the idea of being friends with people 
from ages 14 to 50+ (hope I didnt miss anyone and make them feel too old 
your young :) gives you a wide variety of view points.  The best raves ive 
been to are the ones where I have been able to go 'hangout with my friends, 
dance and listen to kickass music'. Everyone has their reasons for going to 
yer stereotypical 'grungy in a warehouse, with blasting music and thousands 
of people you dont know 10hours straight' party. But for me its music + 
meeting cool people.

My point here is there are two different 'scenes'. There is the 
party/massive scene. Where you are just one in the crowd. Going to parties, 
getting high (for some people), dancing/djing/whatever and going home.  You 
meet some cool people do some fun things.

Then there is the pb-cle-family scene. Where everybody knows your name :) 
Where you care about everybody and everybody cares about you.  Where people 
really are friends.

*I* think its much cooler for the list to respect the family more then the 
'scene'. Its a much higher goal. Itl be a grand day when both are one and 
the same. (Dear god just look at our representation at phorm)  So next time 
someone post something 'offtopic' think about it. But at the same time the 
next time you post something that isnt 'rave related' maybe you should just 
post it to your friends?

Just my two cents. I think if someone complains that a post is 'off topic' 
and irrelevent they should get to know the family better. Become a part of 
it. Im sure once they do they will see the relevency of the post.  If 
nothing else, isnt it just faster to hit delete then type  an email 
explaing why you just hit delete?

Just my two cents.

Maybe we need a second list? pb-cle-raves-family

Again, I don't think it's necessary for this post to be on the list.  If
it's not about the scene then why is it?  Maybe they have a 'mural
painting/no brain cell/ex-boyfriend with new girlfriend' chat room you
can find to talk about this stuff.  Most of us are on this list to
exchange information about the pgh/cle scene, so please stop wasting our
time.

starting one called pb-cle-raves-alt.flame.flame.flame awhile back.

yep thats the kinda place it is,  when brian told me where it was i laughed
at him and told him thats not a good place to have it.   here's some
geography for you out of town folx:
boardman, rich well to do community with a well funded po-po department
right next door.  beaver, bored hick cops who like to sit RIGHT at the
outer limits looking for drunks.   oh and an added bonus of a state po-po
barracks right there.   not a popular bar for the ppl to travel to.  well
at least if you plan on drinking ANYTHING. 

>Well, big up all the pb-cle in the place . . . you know who you are.
not us coz jade was 17 and they wouldnt let us in.   i kinda saw this
coming, but brian told me it was a bar and didnt say 18+, nor did the
flyer, nor did either of their "info lines"  well the one didnt say
anything other than mailbox full.  anyhoo we just bought some wine coolers
and hit my place for us to play on my 12s.   it was either that or cinci,
which is ummmm 4.5 hrs away.  oh well...

Yeah . . . me and frankie almost had a problem with this, until we
talked to one of the promoters and it was set that we would spin, and
even then they didn't want to let us in . . . but they did eventually.

Schwanke, I agree with like everything you said except the fact you are a
geek.  Id say you are a raving lunatic  ;)

You have a point here, perhaps a second list could be made something to the
order of pb-cle-raves-announce which would be moderated and only serve the
purpose of dissemenating the cold hard facts, ie the ROM, Lineup times,
directions etc.  Of course we all know that these dont always pull through
as lineups change etc, but it would quell any  arguments about casual vs.
formal postings.  Personally, i dont really sense widespread dissatifaction
in da first place.

thats my 2

rave on

jbrick

PS props to dj smalls (dc) who gave an x-cellent performance of da funky
beatz at soba last night despite the mostly lackadasial crowd.

Just wanted to tell that you have been saved to my pb-cle file.  It's kind
of my refrigerator.  I slap the things up there that I might want to read
again because I feel they're well written or express an interesting point.
Many of you have already been saved and notified.

I don't know about that.  If it were any other event where alcohol was to
be served, under the same circumstances, the outcome might have been the
same.  I do not, however, know the politics of the area.  For all I know,
it WAS just a window of opportunity for the police.  At least they didn't
say 'We don't need people crossing (U.S.) 15 in the dark, on
hallucinagenic drugs.`  Just a thought.

Hmm, it got busted? Amanda and I left before then. We just weren't
having that much fun. There were far too many people just sitting
around, and too few dancing :( I thought the party was 18 and
over, how could there have been a curfew violation? (They neglected
to mention the 18 and over thing until the night of the party on
the infoline.)

Yeah, we saw that old dude too. How about the bridal party that showed
up? There were like 5 girls (one in a veil) sitting at the bar doing
shots, I think she may have been the one making requests to the
dj. And did you see the Hank Williams look-alike at the bar with
the pipe? Entertaining at least.

Yeah, they gave everybody a hard time.

Hey, I finally got to hear Underworld played at a party. That alone
was worth the $5 for me.

I heard one of the dealers telling someone that 'this was their party'
and his girlfriend was collecting money at the door.

Still, I didn't feel ripped off just because of the $5 admission.

it means someone used HTML in their email, something frowned upon on these

Hey everybody,

I was wondering if anyone could help me.  I've been wanting to go to scj
@ laga for awhile now but I don't have any id saying i'm 18.  From the
way u guys talk it sounds as if they don't check id's but I have a few
friends who are regulars @ the wed. night goth/industrial thingy and
they tell me that they all get carded, _every_ week, and the people at
the door not only glance at them, but stare at them for a pretty long
time.  I don't get it.  Are there different promoters different nights,
or more relaxed people @ the doors on tues. or what? 

also about other weeklies:  soba's 21+ right?  and awhile ago I read
something about club chameleon in the strip having an electronic night
but I haven't heard anything since.  does anyone know anything about it?



thanx:)
jesse

Here's the situation as I've experienced it.
Originally it was advertized as 'all ages' - like totally all ages, no
stipulation about a picture id, or being 18 or whatever.   After a few
months though, and perhaps some sort of visit by the LCB, they started
requiring the pic id thing.  Truthfully, you don't have to be 18 to get a
pic id, and i'm pretty sure that's all you need.

Lately I've noticed they're not even enforcing the id thing...i think the
last 3-4 times i've been they just took the money and that was it.  But
there's still that risk.

If you don't have an id, i might suggest getting a state id.  The cost is
minimal, and you can get them @ the same place as driver's licenses.  I
believe it does say your age/d.o.b. since a friend of mine uses her's to
get into bars.

I think its different people at the door/different security feeling.
Its pretty stupid if you asked me.  They have all-ages shows there all the
time with the bar open (they just check ids at the cage or give you a
stamp or something), and there doesn't seem to be any problem.

Yeah soba is 21+ i think...of course i've never been there.
Chameleon...if it still exists (i'm not sure) gave up on its techno night.

As far as other all ages things - friday night NATO @ soba is still
running - 100% all ages in a nice coffeehouse...both dance stuff and
eclectic downtempo stuff is played.   and atomic...its the same situation
with SCJ, but 100% id enforced.

the PBS crew is workin' to put together some sort of 100% all ages
weekly...but its all up in the air right now....

hey everybody:

ok... here's the deal. my mom was bein' shady and decided to look
around the internet for info on me (that's not the kinda shit she
normally does, but...) and found a whole bunch of messages by todd + i
talking about all of the wacky shit i've pulled on her + my dad
recently, such as the "camping trip" to phorm and us going to
youngstown to spin. so anyways, just so they can't dig thru and find
out even more incriminating shit about me + todd, trouty has VERY
GRACIOUSLY taken the archives offline temporarily. he is going to redo
the scripting, and in the process he will change anyone's email
addresses and names who wish to use a fake name in the archives so
similar bullshit wont happen to them. trouty'll post more info about
that, i guess. for the mean time, thanks for dealing with this
inconvenience. 

...??????? ?

I've been off of this list for a few months while I chilled up in Seattle
for the summer (worked lots, partied more).  Anywayz, I'm back trying to
learn geek stuff at cmu and hopefully going to lots of parties in the pgh
area (I hope to make it up to cleveland lots too!).  Hope I get to see all
the familiar faces and some new ones soon.  How has it been while I've
been gone?  Last pgh party I went to was ghetto-booty-battle (which was
...interesting) and I'm very curious as to how the scene has changed or
whether it has at all.  Hope all of you had a great summer.

pEace,
jP

What's up people? This is Brian from Sphere, and here comes some
explanations about Weird Science on Saturday in Youngstown...please keep
on reading...
  Ok, here's the delly, when we first got the space, The Outer Limits, we
got it because of the location right by the highway off ramp, so no need
for driving through the city or anything...When I talked to the owner, he
asked, "how many people will be over 21?" And then he asked, "How many
under 18?" I answered, "a few, is that a problem?" and he said, "no."
Well, after we promoted, and set up the infolines, on Saturday about 7pm,
he told us, "no one under 18, and no one without an id allowed." I tried
to work out something but no luck...We have never had problems with this
before, and our other events have been in clubs, So I acted as quick as
possible to change to infoline, but a few people must have called prior
to the correction. Sphere deeply apologizes to anyone and everyone who
had problems because of this.
  Now against what Trout Soup had said, the space was perfect, it was
right off of the highway, it was a club, so it had all the necessary
permits to keep Youngstown 5.0 off our backs, and the owner "seemed"
perfectly cooperative and aware, after some explaining, as to what would
go on.  Well, when people started to show up around 9pm, we actually
opened and had music going an hour early, he saw the "scary" raver kids
lining up to come in and began to get nervous.  And after a few hundred
people had come through the door, and he remembered that he wasn't
getting a cut from the cover charge, only alcohol and water sales, he
began to get very upset. He was giving us a hard time all night about
stupid shit...and oh, by the way, before the party had even started, he
made a comment that if there were only a few people here, would we still
have to stay open until 8am?, I told him there will be more than a few
people here,  it just showed he still didn't know what to expect...So
anyway, we owed him some money for security and such, and we figured that
if we payed him now, which was around 3:30am, he would calm down and
relax, well little did we know that after we payed him, that cops
mysteriously busted someone in the parking lot who was 16, although none
of Sphere of Happy Head saw the police when we had continually check the
parking lot throughout the night...We the owner then said that the cops
will issue him a citation, and upon asking him "for what," he couldn't
give me a straight answer, after 4am for who knows what.  And he said
there is no way he is going to get a citation, that the party is over at
4am, and if we don't cooperate, he will have his security pull the plugs,
and literally "throw" people out.  And prior to this event we informed
the local police, actually the locals, and the county, about what would
be going on and they said no problem, and the even offered to patrol the
parking lot to watch the cars, they were very cooperative to say the
least.  But it just seemed to us that the owner of the club realized that
his liqueur license expired at 2:30am, and he had to be there all night,
and his people had already been paid, that it was time to shut the place
down, basically he didn't give a shit about us and you guys, he wasn't
making anymore money, so leaving it open for us was pointless... 
  Well, there's the scoop, we apologize greatly to the people who could
not get in, and to everyone that expected to be there until 8am and were
greatly disappointed, trust me, I did not want this to happen as much as
the next dude, I had to work the door and got to dance for about 15min
after we found out we were getting shut down. It also sucked, because
Kevin Cunningham and Tic Tak decided to come down and spin on the open
tables, and they were cut after an hour, and Free Bass, Circuit 6, Da
Mofo, and Eric D didn't get to play at all...sorry to all, but we are
actually in the works to possibly take this guy to civil court for this,
which might end up to be a major landmark  for the whole rave
scene...I'll keep you posted.

Thanks.
Sphere

to protect the anonymity of a friend, i stripped the headers of the mail 
they sent me...and forwarded their post to the list just cos i think its 
pretty fucking funny...

they said:

> What the fuck is going on with this list
>first it's exboyfriend mural painting shit and 
>now this.  Give me some history, is this the worst it's
>been, or was it worse in olden times


================

the answer is:

in 1992 we had a spell were ppl were posting messages, 10, 20 a day 
sometimes...AND NO ONE WOULD USE THE SPACE BAR!

this of course made for strained eyes...and seeing as how many of us 
were using GOPHER or even worse ftp'ing from UNIX boxes (none of this 
hotmail bullshit thank you very much...oh wait, i have a hotmail acct 
now, nevermind ;) - well, that summer 12 list members went blind.

so yes, dear mystery person, it was MUCH worse in the olden days, back 
when we all had timex-sinclair 1000's with the little shit-ass gel 
keypad (think cheap sports illustrated calculator quality) and the 
whopping 4K of RAM!

we had 1200 baud modems and we liked it.

seriously tho, i emailed frankie privately and warned him if he ever got 
the list involved in his little personal DRAMAS that i would pull rank 
on him and demote him to 'cub-junglist'...i have half a mind to kick out 
of the clique outright...first that little 'email my moms' business, now 
this? ;)

sorry im posting so much, this lack of steady net access has me jonesin' 
yo.


you would be smart to believe *everything* i wrote.

peace,
hossam

hey...

i am in cleveland right now.

later on tonite is steel city jungle...anyone in the north ohio/maybe 
even youngstown area planning on going?

i just dont want to drive there and back (i have to come back to 
cleveland on wed.) when i already drove up here and have to go back, 
etc.

i can get you (and probably even a guest) in for free, if you're over 21 
i can sort you out with a free drink ticket or two, etc. etc. all in 
addition to the usual help with gas & tolls crap.

it's dj sine, alongside the dj's mogli and troll from cincy...should be 
a fun nite, esp following on the heels of the stormer we had two weeks 
ago.

i promise it'll be fun...email me back @ this acct and let me know asap 
please.

peace,
hossam

    My friend Jenn wants me to write an article about the pb-cle list
for the next Fame Records (Akron, OH) newsletter. Anyone have any ideas
on what I should include? I thought it'd be a good idea to ask you guys
cuzz it will be about all of us (in general). thanks for the help and
I'll make sure I put the final article up on the list.

Come and join us this Friday, August 28th at Trilogy for the sounds of:

*********JENO (Wicked San Francisco)************

"Born in London in the mid-sixties, and citing his "Mum's far-out record
collection" as a major early influence, Jeno has always had a magical
relationship with his music. A relationship that has only been strengthened by
his unconventional upbringing, his five chaotic years as a punk musician and
then his head first fall into the London warehouse party scene of the mid-
eighties. It was here that he begged for, borrowed and even stole his first
tunes and turntables, developing a passionate love for dance music that led to
many memorable gigs (including his own heady "Whoosh" parties) and spontaneous
adventures, often with his old mates with the now infamous Tonka Sound System.
After heading to San Francisco in '91 in search of a more psychedelic
perspective, he and several close friends began the now legendary Full Moon
parties. The friendly vibe and crazy hedonism found at these free outdoor
events attracted a large and extremely diverse group of heads, who it seems
were destined to collectively help create and shape the future of the so-
called underground dance scene in Northern California. Inspired by the acid-
drenched, jazz layed, funk driven and disco'd out glory days of San
Francisco's past, Jeno, along with the other Wicked DJ's, has helped define an
eclectic and soulful music style that has become known as the San Francisco
Sound. " 
**Taken from the United DJ's of America, Volume 7- Jeno- CD Cover**  

Experience Jeno this Friday, August 28th, at Trilogy, along with:

*Rob Sherwood*
*Mike Filly*
*Rob Black*
*McQ*

Hey Everyone...
Obviously you all know where I will be this Friday night... 
Is anyone else planning to go, or think they might go? 
I am starting a list of people who are going, so please email me... 
I am still trying to work out just what this list will mean, (VIP room drinks,
or what), but I would like to gather the list anyway! Hope to see many of you
Friday!!

i'm sure most of you read frankies post, thats the reality of it.  WATCH
WHAT YOU POST HERE, IT CAN BE FOUND AND CAN BE READ BY ANYONE.  i tried
putting in the spider stuff so they'd would ignore the archives, but lo, it
appeared on hotbot not a week later with the new URLs listed.
so i'm thinking of a ONE TIME DEAL, i'm not sure how i'm going to go about
it or when, i've got alot to do since my home dir got trashed at
hyperreal...  but doing a awk or sed on the ENTIRE ARCHIVES for email
addresses and replacing them with null emails.  i only intend to do this
once since some people didnt seem to realize that the archives were there.
now when you sub it says straight off that there is one.   i'll post more
when i get it all sorted out.

     well, as is my wont, i got myself into a bigger deal
     than i can handle, by convincing my editor that i should
     do the cover story for the first issue of 'impulse'
     magazine (the weekly entertainment issue of the pitt 
     news). the subject? you guessed it: raves.

     soooo... 

     i have to come up with a 15000 char. story, plus a two
     page photo spread by september fifth or so. lucky me :P

     questions: does anybody have any particularly phat 
     photos they'd like to see in this article? i'm going
     to break out some fuji 1600 and my trusty canon AE-1,
     but i'm not sure i can get enough diverse pics by that
     time.

     also, i need interviews with people within the scene,
     from places other than pittsburgh. if there's anyone
     who's been raving for a while, anywhere, and can get 
     articulate about it, lemme know. or in pgh, for that
     matter.

     'mkay?

First off shout outs to Matt--Ratfink--.  We conducted a two man net-meet!!
Word up Pb-cle-raves reprezent.  Heeheheh. Well anyway for the short time I
stayed at the party I had a blast.  My sinuses made me leave
early(4real4real!!), and if this wacky weather would stop I could stay out
longer.  Instead of staying home on cold and sinus medz.  Anyway I love I love
7up.  The bottom room was hotter than a mutha Fu*ka, and all of ya'll rock.
The more I go out here in cleveland the more I like it!!=)

to go.  I love Troll, dnb. Excellent, I suggest everyone go there 
tonight.

     what does _that_ mean? you don't sound too certain 
     of it, either. as far as i'm concerned, my week looks
     like this: SCJ tues, atomic thurs, be there fri, and

	one.

ok.

if you live in or near cleveland/akron/youngstown.

you should go with me to steel city tonite.

i will drive to where you are...i just dont want to drive to pgh and 
back when i already am up here...i will meet you wherever. let me know.

if you are on the fence about the issue, consider this to be a 
figurative nudge forward.

(in other words...just GO)

i'll introduce you to most of my semi-alcoholic yet suprisingly cool 
friends...and i will let you punch josh in the nose as i pin his arms 
behind him. but then you have to let me punch him as well, just cause he 
attempted to mock me today.

for the love of god and all that is holy -- someone please HELP me.

whine,
hossam

ps- geekboy, under NO circumstances should you even consider allowing 
josh to be anywhere near you...before you know it he will be pounding 
his fist on the table & unleashing a torrent of rage-fueled spittle 
(while quite probably hyperventilating)in his eagerness to show that he 
is the man. and we all know the truth about THAT one, eh joshy? :*

     to quell the rumors:

     due to massive personal and financial problems,
     the date on this event will most likely be 
     changed. it is not, at this point, canceled.
     we are going ahead with preparations, however,
     since we would like to ensure that this party
     goes as smoothly as it should, we intend to
     take more time to work on it.

     this in no way reflects on the integrity or
     ability of PBS and the future consortium takes
     full responsibility for this unplanned occurence.

     thankyou

i appologize for the tardiness of this review, but i have not been able to get
online to check/send out emails due to a lack of enthusiasm on the school's
part for getting the network up and running.  anyway, enough babbling.

Phreak Show was a great party.....the people were awesome (more on that later)
the music was out of this world and the venue wasn't half bad....other than a
little overcrowding at times...some problems w/ heat....and an overly sticky
floor (i almost broke an ankle due to this one)....but all in all i would have
to say lovebomb put together a party to remember......now comes the part on
the people and yet another reason i won't forget this party any time soon.....

just let me say HANSLGRETL i really wish i would have gotten your email before
i went to the party....as my friend and i tried to leave around 3:30am we
noticed that another car had replaced it and that ours had apparently been
stolen!!!!  after calling the cops 4 times and waiting until 8:00am for any
type of police officer to show up...we were kinda pissed off to say the least.
 this also made for a long nite since we're from north of pittsburgh.  thank
you to all of you who tried to help us or gave us free cigarettes, offered us
a place to crash, etc. to help ease our troubles, but most of all i have to
say THANK YOU...AND WE OWE YOU BIG TIME to kelly and rich....they gave us a
ride back to pittsburgh....put up w/ my friend whining most of the way
home....and still managed to treat us better than we've ever been treated
before....my friend actually told me "if it weren't so damn expensive, i would
recommend that everyone have their car stolen at a rave...the people are
sooooo wonderful." we really do appreciate it....kelly and rich...if there's
ever anything we can do up here in meadville....let us know!!!

as for the results of the story...the cops i guess found his car (totally
stripped of the $1100 brand new subwoofers, all 400 cds and my wallet)...and
he's being told that he won't be able to get more than $200 reimbursement for
the cd's and almost nothing for the sound system....gotta love life!!!  but
all in all the party itself was kickin'...we both had a great time and met
some awesome people....kelly and rich thank you again.....i'm now done
babbling.

peace

Hey_You

ps...rich....what's up??

<< whats the sound?  much to my chagrin, i've never heard any of them  >>

Jeno is one of the best dj's I have evr heard.  He plays deep funky house with
a slight west coast touch.  If you get a chance pick up his UNITED DJ'S OF
AMERICA cd.  It is the green one.  this is one of the tightest cd's i have
ever heard.  This is one of the guys responsible for the scene in SanFran.  He
was part of the crew who through the legendary free Full Moon Parties out
there, not to mention the founding partner of the wicked crew.  highly
recomended!!!

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 NEGATIVLAND STOPPED DEAD (see also
http://www.negativland.com/riaa/index.html)
   Contacts: mailto:mark@negativland.com (Mark Hosler, Negativland)
             mailto:hrosen@riaa.com (Hilary Rosen, President and CEO,

             mailto:ray.thomas@rtmark.com (Ray Thomas, RTMARK)
 
 The career of recording artists Negativland may be over.
 
 Negativland's CD plant has told the group that it will no longer
 manufacture their CDs, and Negativland has so far been unable to find
 another factory willing to do so. The reason, according to Mark Hosler
 of Negativland, is the RIAA's recent guidelines to compact disk
 pressing plants, which inform the plants that they risk huge lawsuits
 if they manufacture CDs with even one uncleared sample.
 
 Negativland uses uncleared samples extensively, and consider this to
 be Fair Use under the 1976 U.S. Copyright Act. Still, the group has
 had to establish their own label because other labels consider
 Negativland music too legally risky to distribute. With this new
 offensive by the RIAA, CD factories feel they cannot afford the risk
 either, which effectively silences Negativland.
 
 Many bands besides Negativland--including Beck, Beastie Boys, Public
 Enemy, Nine Inch Nails, etc.--routinely use uncleared samples, but
 only Negativland, Illegal Art (which with RTMARK's help produced
 Deconstructing Beck), and a few others do so openly, and as an
 essential part of their esthetic.
 
 According to Ray Thomas of RTMARK, whose Intellectual Property mutual
 fund (http://rtmark.com/projectlist.html) is managed by Negativland,
 "The industry saw how much bad publicity Geffen and BMG suffered for
 trying--unsuccessfully--to clamp down on Deconstructing Beck. They
 realized public opinion would not let them get away with such
 high-handed tactics, so now they're cleverly targeting production,
 which has a much lower public profile than distribution, but is even
 more important. The RIAA is putting CD manufacturers in the position
 of policing what is and is not acceptable art, and is thus very
 effectively practicing censorship."
 
 The problem is a fundamental misunderstanding of copyright law,
 according to Thomas. "The music industry says copyright law protects
 artists. But copyright law as applied to samples serves only to
 protect corporate money. As the recording industry forces this issue
 to a head, we hope that the facts will finally become clear, and that
 the groundwork will be laid to change copyright law so that it
 benefits artists and consumers, not corporations and capital."
 
 Negativland's full press release, including e-mail addresses of many
 RIAA employees, as well as a response by Hilary Rosen, President and
 CEO of the RIAA, can be found at
 http://www.negativland.com/riaa/index.html.
 
 
 RTMARK was established in 1991 to further anti-corporate activism, in
 some cases by channelling funds from donors to workers for sabotage of
 corporate products. Recent and upcoming acts of RTMARK-aided
 subversion are documented on RTMARK's web site, http://rtmark.com/.

This was my last scj for quite some time.  Off I go to the land of
Indians and the -ton of Blooming.  If my breaks and scj's are oriented in
the same way they were last year, it'll probably be my last for at least
four months.   Unless they shut it down (then it'll be never again), and
from the looks of things, I think it's a possibility.

Tonight was a little anti-climactic.  I guess I shouldn't have tried to
expect the moon.  It was very nice seeing the PBS crew.  Guess what...I
saw toM DANCE!!!!  And I thought he was just a wall groover.   I was also
wondering if the mc for Mogli was having shampooing problems.  He kept
wanting us to rinse it out.  I may be wrong, though.  He may have wanted
to rinse the grape juice out of the carpet or the soap out of his mouth.
Last but not least, on the way to the car, one of the 'soliciters', shall
we call them, accosted Michael and me.  He tried to get change out of
Michael because he could see that he was the man of the house because he
was wearing a Calgon shirt.  I wonder why that made him the man of the
house.  Too bad Michael didn't have any money (he had to borrow two bucks
from Geoff for ear plugs).  Funny how I was the one with the cash.  I
guess he should have asked me, but then again, I'm not the man of the
house.  

Dancing and socializing in general sort of mystify me, nowadays.  I watch
people, as I'm sure all of you do, and I find myself categorizing certain
traits.  Depending on what I'm watching, it might be dance style, hook-up
style, put-up-a-front style.  I categorize and I wonder if someone else is
checking me down for a group.  Is all of society just pretense?  I wonder
if I've just started to notice it because I've had such a long time to see
the different types in this particular scene.  Maybe it's a good thing I'm
going away.  I won't be able to reflect on the Pittsburgh scene for awhile
and when I get back I'll be too grateful to care.

Jenifer Foulmood

ps I've forgotten.  What exactly is the job of an mc?  Is it to hype the
crowd or hype the dj?

The INFO LINE said "Freaks" is in a 100% legal venue and all dj's are
definitely confirmed".
What follows is a letter from one of the promoters (?)  that was posted to
midwest raves:
 
 Hi - I would just like to inform everyone on the list about the problem 
 with our fellow - so called - "plur" kids - which I feel is very ironic 
 considering their name stands for something they obviously are not.  I 
 am a partner in the ANALOGUE SYSTEMS party - FREAKS BELIEVE IN BEATS.  
 In fact, it is my money that is going into throwing this event which  - 
 by the way - I too have a full time job and am a student on top of the 
 promotor business. We have worked for months on this party and spent 
 upwards of 25,000 to throw this party - with a line-up that is extensive 
 and one of the tightest I have ever seen in Detroit - let alone 
 anywhere.  While I go to school on the east coast, I come back to 
 Detroit for the kids and for the music and for the vibe that I brag 
 about to all my friends that have never experienced anything near the 
 motor city.  They are amazed that we are only charging 25 dollars for 
 presale and even more amazed that people who promote love and unity and 
 respect and peace would go to the extent that they are going to to 
 DESTROY other people that care about the scene and their efforts.  
    Analogue systems is having our two year anniversary party - bringing 
 in another TIGHT line-up just like in the past.  Look at the facts - a 
 25,000 dollar event - it will take at least 1,000 people to break even - 
 a hard thing to do in Detroit.  Do you think me or my partner are in it 
 for the money?  We will both tell you we are not  - we can't possibly 
 when budgets are what they are these days for quality events.  
   So, I thank the PLUR kids for making me stress out and I thank all of 
 you on this list for reading over this and maybe seeing the perspective 
 of the promotor's side.  Yeah - we can cut costs at places - get DJs for 
 free - but we reinvest that money in other areas to bring a quality 
 event - and as I have on my video tape of one of our last events in MAY 
 - when the cops were raiding it and everyone was leaving - people were 
 sad, but they are quoted as walking out the door and saying, "Well, it 
 was one of the phatest parties I have ever been to even if it did get 
 busted" - and everyone around them cheered as the cops pushed them out 
 the door....that is the kind of vibe that we are able to give to people 
 - that shows the effort pays off.  
 Please, if you are going to Detroit this weekend - think about that - 
 think about what people's reasons are - because now you guys know mine - 
 it is not the money - it is not the presteige - I help throw parties and 
 work my ass off and stress because I know that we can do a quality job 
 and there are not that many people out there that care to and respect 
 the scene that much to do so for PURE reasons like that alone and not 
 just to "player hate" others.  Sincerely, maureen Mcinerney, Analogue 
 Systems, Detroit, USA

Hi - I would just like to inform everyone on the list about the problem 
with our fellow - so called - "plur" kids - which I feel is very ironic 
considering their name stands for something they obviously are not.  I 
am a partner in the ANALOGUE SYSTEMS party - FREAKS BELIEVE IN BEATS.  
In fact, it is my money that is going into throwing this event which  - 
by the way - I too have a full time job and am a student on top of the 
promotor business. We have worked for months on this party and spent 
upwards of 25,000 to throw this party - with a line-up that is extensive 
and one of the tightest I have ever seen in Detroit - let alone 
anywhere.  While I go to school on the east coast, I come back to 
Detroit for the kids and for the music and for the vibe that I brag 
about to all my friends that have never experienced anything near the 
motor city.  They are amazed that we are only charging 25 dollars for 
presale and even more amazed that people who promote love and unity and 
respect and peace would go to the extent that they are going to to 
DESTROY other people that care about the scene and their efforts.  
   Analogue systems is having our two year anniversary party - bringing 
in another TIGHT line-up just like in the past.  Look at the facts - a 
25,000 dollar event - it will take at least 1,000 people to break even - 
a hard thing to do in Detroit.  Do you think me or my partner are in it 
for the money?  We will both tell you we are not  - we can't possibly 
when budgets are what they are these days for quality events.  
  So, I thank the PLUR kids for making me stress out and I thank all of 
you on this list for reading over this and maybe seeing the perspective 
of the promotor's side.  Yeah - we can cut costs at places - get DJs for 
free - but we reinvest that money in other areas to bring a quality 
event - and as I have on my video tape of one of our last events in MAY 
- when the cops were raiding it and everyone was leaving - people were 
sad, but they are quoted as walking out the door and saying, "Well, it 
was one of the phatest parties I have ever been to even if it did get 
busted" - and everyone around them cheered as the cops pushed them out 
the door....that is the kind of vibe that we are able to give to people 
- that shows the effort pays off.  
Please, if you are going to Detroit this weekend - think about that - 
think about what people's reasons are - because now you guys know mine - 
it is not the money - it is not the presteige - I help throw parties and 
work my ass off and stress because I know that we can do a quality job 
and there are not that many people out there that care to and respect 
the scene that much to do so for PURE reasons like that alone and not 
just to "player hate" others.  Sincerely, maureen Mcinerney, Analogue 
Systems, Detroit, USA

Hello Listees,

after Transfix we have taken a little break to catch up with all the
things that had been put aside for the success of the party. Now it's
time to get back to the construction of the website.  While this
happens it's a good time to submit suggestions on what content you
would like to see appear on it, and to make contributions. Go see the
website and see the various sections and let us know if you are
interested in helping us in our project. Send us party reviews, record
reviews and so forth... help transdimensional create a great website.


Thanks to all that have supported us so far.


Al.

Pay no attention to the subject line.
SCJ was quite wicked last night...musically, it was killer.
Top sets all around that didn't forget the hardsteppers -

do check out MOGLI if you haven't before...this guy has got to be the 
midwests best kept secret.  On my personal list, i'd put him pretty high 
up there.  TROLL was quite nice and diverse too, and (MC) SINE roughed up
the remaining (PBS) kids with mother-like brutality. ;) we loves the
abuse.

still...i'd say anyone into jungle: come out to this!  The music is so
consistantly excellent, but the crowds are consistantly smaller...

Big-Up the Schenley-High Stamina Massive!
Big-Up all pb-cle kids in the place!
Big-Up the natural echo effect!
Big-Up mysterious mind-chemical treated pizza!

errr...

- cutup

     *sniffle*

     so, no SCJ for me. i didn't have the cash,
     can you believe it? actually, i think i'm
     more distressed over the family problems 
     i'm having, and didn't even care.

     that's bad.

     well, i'm glad all you others had fun.

I have only one made-up word that can describe last night at 
SCJ.....BADASS!!!!!!

>From the moment i entered the glorious shrine known to most as club 
Laga, i couldnt stop dancing...sine was tearin the shit up from the 
git-go....Then Mogli....OH MOGLI....started up with Sine MCin and i was 
goin mad...I was completely lovin it...

When all us PBS crew took the stage, we were goin mad like insane 
mongooses. Troll held it down as well....

this was the absolute most fun id ever had at SCJ....even though i have 
a ball every other tuesday of the month....

Shouts to all the PBS kids...the schenley massive...even though most us 
graduated already....
 
Now on a more depressing note....the turnout last night, id seemed to me 
was rather poop..not very amny people there for sucha hype night..If 
anyone reading this, has heard a lot about SCJ and hasnt come down 
yet...DO IT...you will not regret it at all....Ill gaurantee you a good 
time or you can punch me in the stomach...

By the way...if you were there...I was the semi-rotund gentleman with 
the blue flowered print shirt who just couldnt stop grovin...if you see 
me say hi id love to meet more people....

predicate monkeys,
andythejew

WHATTHEFUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, you don't have to be a raver, actually.

Anyway, a friend of mine in the Cleveland area who buys houses is in need
of several people who can paint (experience preferred but not required).

He's paying a rate that is pretty impressive.  If you are interested,
please call Rob @ 216-795-1815.  If you get the voice mail, leave a
detailed message as to how he may reach you.

Since the houses are in Cleveland, living in NE Ohio would be a good idea.

Good luck,

Braden

P.S. For all you soon to be college grads and young professionals, my
company's next job fair is October 5 at the downtown Cleveland Sheraton
Hotel.  It's free and hors d'oeuvres will be served.  Keep it in mind.

So, I went to my first scj last night w/ my friend dave and danced my
ass off!  thanx to all the people who responded to my post, I really
appreciate the help.  

anyway, even tho we could only stay 2 hrs. we both had tons of fun.  I'm
sure I saw a bunch of u guys but seeing as how I don't know what any of
u look like...I didn't get to meet anyone.  oh well.  If anyone's
interested I was the guy in the eraserhead shirt, who had no rhythm
dancing (which is really embarassing considering that I'm a musician:P 
)

it's too bad more people didn't show up.  hopefully i can go in two wks.
and I'll bring new recruits:)

c ya,
jesse

p.s.  my back hurts and I have a cold:(  *whine*

Did he play 168 (Club Joy) a lot a few years ago?  Is he slight of
build, medium height, light colorings, and does he have glasses?

I REALLY want to go to "Freaks Believe in Beats".    My one car is sick and my
other car I wouldn't leave alone in detroit.   I am looking for a
ride....anyone have room??????        or thinking of renting a car for a
day...anyone interested?????

The line up is in-freakin-credible!!       (I don't recall seeing the line up
posted... was it?)    

"Sunshine.."  in Baltimore looks good too.   I talked to some ravers in the NY
area and it appears most everyone in that area is going to be at that party.

hi jennifer, no actually scott henry is a dj/promoter from dc who has 
been instrumental in helping the scene take shape since day one.

this brief, unauthorised bio is by no means exhaustive and only 
represents the small bit of knowledge that i have that i can remember at 
this time.

stemming back to early 1991, he has planned, put together, promoted, and 
played at numerous raves, parties, and clubs. starting with weekly 
events in baltimore such as orbit and citrus, going forward to the first 
incarnation of buzz, the long running club nite fever, playing 
ultraworld and catastrophic parties in dc/baltimore, playing raves all 
up and down the east coast and now all over the country, the man defined 
the scene for many of us back in the day.

he had a way of playing that absolutely rocked you. he would *regularly* 
induce tears on the dancefloor. you knew when scott henry was playing, 
because thats when you would be dancing the hardest you ever had in your 
life, having the most fun you could ever imagine. you would be hugging 
strangers just as readily as you would your best friends. 

this is not hyperbole. ask around.

while being totally immersed (literally 24/7/365) in the scene for 
almost 9 years will undoubtedly take a toll on anyone, the man can still 
rock a dancefloor at the drop of a beat.

come check him out tonite at metropol.


peace,
hossam

delete if you don't care about the effect of this list on one person's party
habits.

i think i subscribed to this list about six months ago.  i used to check
hyperreal occasionally, and i didn't feel it was necessary to get the tips on
parties.  but i joined anyways.  i can't remember why.  i remember not posting
for a while, secretly wanting to say, "get a hobby, all of you."  well i still
want to say that sometimes, but anyways.  i just wanted to know about parties.
i deleted posts about your equipment, clothes, attitudes, drugs, and ex-
boyfriends.  

after a while i got less snotty.  i realized that, believe it or not, i could
get information more efficiently and effectively here than from any other
source ...

well anyways, i'm just gonna say that this list really does make me feel more
welcome at parties - after my first netmeet at <<phunktion>> about two months
ago, i made friends with a lot more kids.  it's strange because i've become
really really interested in parties lately, and i know that some of it has to
do with you all, and i didn't want to get so involved that i did the whole
netmeeting/spending-hours-driving/"come to my house after the party" thing.
parties have become a big part of my life, and i never wanted that before.  i
still maintain my other interests, but right now i feel healthier than i can
remember feeling.  it's like what schwanke was saying, how some of us just
take it all in, and some of us join in the pb-cle fambly.  so those if us who
care to share about how we lost our jobs/cars/houses, ran into our exes,
fought with fambly, etc ... well, let's all be supportive.

i also realized that the reason why we don't talk much about events in dc,
detroit, chicago, or cinci - even tho each of these is about four hours from
either pittsburgh or cleveland - is because we've established a network.  if i
have this right, trout the list administrator lives halfway between cleveland
and pittsburgh.  so it's all his fault.

so.  that's my story of how i got conned into this subculture by listmembers.

no fighting no biting -
david spy

now the only place i've heard scott henry is on mixtapes but...

i think he's pretty amazing. he plays at 9 out of 10 buzzes and i hear
the crowds eat it up every time. i saw on a flyer that he was spinning
outside for 8 hours straight, going thru the history of his musical
progression + all that. 

that would be pretty amazing. 

then again, buzz is so large that richie hawtin was probably spinnin a
3 hr set in the main room @ the same time.

*drool* ...big raves

buzz is his party. he and lieven degyndt are the two promoters 
responsible for this amazing club. thus, his resident status @ buzz.

sometime.

what're you gonna do if i move to arizona?   yikes!
for listing on the rom i've gone by a rule of thumb of a 4 hr or so drive
from youngstown, since i'm in between pb & cle....  and theres the dc-raves
list, 313-list, cinci i put on the rom, but noone ever really talks about
it.  i dont think there are many events there really.  dayton as well.

>so.  that's my story of how i got conned into this subculture by listmembers.
resistance is futile.  prepare to be assimilated.

synthvortx@aol.com doesnt like the way i run the rom and says hyperreal is
a joke and is concerned about the state of the rom with the beastie boys
and front 242 listed on it.  comments to trout@hyperreal.org

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, as well as some somewhat related concert events, just testing
this out and we'll see what the reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

signed. i think it will be fun anyway.
david...go to detroit.

You know how you forget things or memories become fuzzy as you become
older and have to learn and store more and more bits of information?
Well, I vaguely recall meeting someone at 168 a long time ago that fit the
description below and had a very similar name.  He was also from Baltimore
or DC (I can't remember which).  I seem to have insulted many people
judging from the amount of private horrified posts I've received!
Terribly sorry.  I'll try never to not know again.

If anyone out there is sitting on the fence about
going to Metropol to see Scott Henry, maybe this will
help you decide. 

The first time Scott played in Pittsburgh was at 
Metropol(Superfresh Feb 96).  We had him play last,
5-7am.  I don't think one person out of the 1000+
who were there left early.  He rocked it for the whole
two hours, and left the crowd in a sweaty mess.  This
is one of the reasons that he is one of the most respected DJs in the country.  

If you have never heard him spin, don't let this chance
pass you by.  Reading about it later is not the same as being there.  Too bad I'm 3000 miles away.

MATT

figure that like maybe, 3-4 out of 36 pictures will come out

Yes, Matt, we here in Pittsburgh still acknowledge how ground-breaking 
your parties were.  How could we ever forget?  You're a legend in these 
parts.

He's around.  You can find his e-mail address on any of the House of Styles
flyers.  He designs them.

Man let me tell you I wish that I could see Scott Henry tomorrow.  I lived in
DC for three years. It was a rare occassion if I missed buzZ. I'd didn't know
it at the time, but DC kids are spoiled.  Buzz week after week brings in the
best and biggest names!  Scott Henry&Lieven are like godfathers of the DC
scene.  Scott Henry when hes behind the table can be called a "GOD".  Someone
mentioned his sets he used to spin on the patio.  They called the Bit-o-honey,
and was it ever SWEET. All that get to see him are in for something special!!!
ahh I miss DC. Only 10 months before I get back for good.

Anyone going to Easy? I'll cya there!!

Moze
reliving happy BuzZ memories

we'll be setting up turntables here at carnegie mellon (in pittsburgh)
starting at noon...we hope to go on through the night as late as
possible...hopefully campus cops will leave us alone...we have DJs
slotted through to 8pm...after that, we're opening up the tables so
bring some records if you wanna spin...

if you plan on coming, don't wait too long before showing up...we're
really not sure if and when we might get shut down by campus cops...if
we get turned off before midnight, i'll post to the list to let people
know...

where we'll be:

we'll be set up in an area next to what is known as the Fence at
CMU...this is more or less in the center of campus, between forbes ave.
and schenley park...go down south on morewood towards
forbes/cmu...morewood ends when it hits forbes, but if you continue
south over the grass/pathways past the construction site, you'll hit the
Fence...in case you get lost, if you ask any CMU student where it is,
i'm sure they'll be able to tell you...there's free parking after 4pm
behind the dorm (morewood gardens) at the corner of forbes and
morewood...the entrance to the parking lot is on forbes, a little past
morewood ave, as you head towards pitt/oakland...

hope to see some of you guys there,

jeff

     Here's just a short article/book review.  I don't think it was posted to
this list, so I figured I'd send it.  My Grandma cut it out for me.  I don't
know who wrote it.  I think it came from either the Friday (8-21-98) or
Saturday (8-22-98) Cleveland Plain Dealer.

Rave on

  Has rave culture gotten too big for its baggy britches? What was once a
subculture based on spontaneous happenings and anonymous DJs playing the
latest in house, techno and drum' n' bass grooves for tripped-out ravers has
become a niche by and large accepted by the mainstream. After all, you can buy
rave wear--tight T-shirts and baggy jeans--at shopping malls; even pop stars
such as U2, David Bowie, Janet Jackson and Madonna have hopped the rave train.
According to author Simon Reynolds, when rave enters mass consciousness and
when its musical practitioners become stars, the happening will have died.
Reynolds, in his just-released book, "Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of
Techno and Rave Culture," constructs a timeline of the music-from 1970s German
synth group Kraftwerk to the early-'80s Detroit scene to the present--where
"electronica" is but a meaningless catch-phrase used to describe the scene's
vastly different substrands and offshoots. Reynolds offers great insight into
the revolutionary aspects of rave culture: the egalitarian relationship
between audience and DJ and the scene's most prevelent drug, ecstasy.
Usually, books that "examine" subcultures tend to be dull, sociological
tracts. This one isn't.

to anyone interested...
this post concerns "freaks believe in the beats" party in detroit this
saturday.
i was SOOOO psyched for this party but things don't seem to be working out and
i may just go to Trilogy(cleveland) on friday and be happy with that.   
the first post is from a dude in detroit i met at "fuckthesystem".   he seems
very  sceptical of this party.   IT PAINS ME TERRIBLY to send this post as i
thought this was going to be one of the best parties of the year(totally
incredible line-up).
he doesn't go into much detail about their  last party except that it wasn't
laid out very well and it was hot....he never mentions if the dj's showed up
or anything about the quality of lights and sound...
DISCLAIMER:   I personally do not know this promoter and did not go to their
last party ...the line-up for this party is incredible!! (if they show)
i personally am still debating on whether to go......
just thought you should know what some people in detroit are saying about the
promoter and their last party

todd



In a message dated 98-08-27 

<<    I've been watching this debate between promoters for weeks now and 
 haven't said shit, but this post seriously pissed me off.  I went to 
 this party in May that she is speaking of, and it was without a doubt 
 set up worse than any other party i've ever been to.  with the lineup 
 that was there you had to figure on a fairly good turnout.  so i'm 
 wondering why the hell you put it in a venue with two giant rooms and 
 only a ten foot wide little door to get between the rooms.  there was no 
 ventilation and while i was sitting near the outside door one time i saw 
 three people getting carried out that had dropped from heat exhaustion.  
 you only had one table selling water so it ended up taking about 
 fifiteen minutes to get one bottle of water.  this was ridiculous seeing 
 that the tables selling capri-suns or whatever the hell it was had 
 nobody near them.  on top of it all, you ended up running out of water 
 abouit four a.m. right before the party got busted.  thank god it got 
 busted too or there would have been people dropping left and right from 
 the heat with no water.  four carloads of my friends from toronto came 
 to that party to check out the detriot scene, and needless to say they 
 have not been back since.  also, please don't act like 1000 is that 
 unreal of a turnout for the D.  fuck the system had an estimated 4500.

    I've been watching this debate between promoters for weeks now and 
haven't said shit, but this post seriously pissed me off.  I went to 
this party in May that she is speaking of, and it was without a doubt 
set up worse than any other party i've ever been to.  with the lineup 
that was there you had to figure on a fairly good turnout.  so i'm 
wondering why the hell you put it in a venue with two giant rooms and 
only a ten foot wide little door to get between the rooms.  there was no 
ventilation and while i was sitting near the outside door one time i saw 
three people getting carried out that had dropped from heat exhaustion.  
you only had one table selling water so it ended up taking about 
fifiteen minutes to get one bottle of water.  this was ridiculous seeing 
that the tables selling capri-suns or whatever the hell it was had 
nobody near them.  on top of it all, you ended up running out of water 
abouit four a.m. right before the party got busted.  thank god it got 
busted too or there would have been people dropping left and right from 
the heat with no water.  four carloads of my friends from toronto came 
to that party to check out the detriot scene, and needless to say they 
have not been back since.  also, please don't act like 1000 is that 
unreal of a turnout for the D.  fuck the system had an estimated 4500.

just got back from metropol and all i have to say is *WOW*!!!

scott henry definately laid down one of the best sets i've ever heard.

it was one of those sets when just when you wanted to stop dancing, the
dj's would lay down an even phatter track, and you just couldn't help
but to keep dancing... that cycle happened again and again and again...
his sense of knowing what the crowd wanted was just awesome and i'd
definately enjoy seeing this guy again anyday.

you could tell how much the guy meant to the crowd when his set was over
because everybody was cheering for a solid 5 minutes at least...

well, just wanted to let everybody know how it was...i'd love to make
this longer, but i gotta get up for class in a few hours. : >

hope a few kids come down to cmu tomorrow to check out the dj's... it
would be great to see some of the net-heads there.

oh yeah, a few quick shout outs to: jen (pittsburgh's gonna miss you. :
<  you better come visit) + mskw1, liquid, geekboy, jeff (see you
tomorrow), hossam, phatandy, andy/sine, bob (thanks for the ride down),
and to all the people i met...

peace...

*hugz*

--spike


p.s. 7up also had a *nice*-ass set from what i heard of it (which was
the second half) nice tracks...

Ok its late so I will make this a short one but ATOMIC really pumped
tonight. I am quiet suppressed it keeps pulling the large numbers that it
does but I ain't complaining especially when we get a treat like tonight!

    I first heard BDee's set of smooth trance which I was really impressed
with by 10:45 he had a sizeable crowd grooving away.

I have heard 7-up a few times and honestly find his music so-so.  Tonight
his set seemed a little harder than I have heard and he was really
energetic seemed to be really enjoying himself as was the packed dance
floor!  He ended playing a mix of the old skewl techno tune 'Dominator' a
fitting welcome for who was to follow.

Scott Henry took the tables playing a mixture of what sounded like house
and techno including a few track which I never heard before that really lit
the place up.  These included a dance track with some sort pseudo-news
piece that you would probably hear about raves on the 700 club (a good
laugh), a tune using a lot from that "Da Da Da" song in the popular car
commercial, and some good hip-hop sampled grooves.  The crowd cheered and
clapped at the end and Scott Henry was very modest pointing to the crowd as
if we had just played our own kickass set.  A great guy! :)  At the end the
stage was packed with fans and talk of 'Easy' was everywhere.

Props to the ATOMIC crew (House of Styles) for getting this thing going, I
had a mavellous sweaty time.

hi to those pb-cle-ravers I saw there as well :)

plur :-))

Sounds cool - all CMU dj types?  It really seems like CMU should be a
fertile garden of eclectic djness.  I'll definitely try to come down and
at least hang out for a bit...i'd bring records (i'm itchin to spin -
anyone want to book some jungle/happyhc/gabber?), but i'll probably have
to leave before 8pm.  I might bring some records i'm willing to swap
though....

....which leads into this:  I just picked up a comp from the Shut Up and
Dance label - its their first 20 singles on a 2 record lp...some raw
low-fi protojungle, ragga, and rave tunes from the likes of the Ragga
Bros, Shut Up + Dance, Codine, etc...it strikes me as something a
collector kid might want, so i'm offering it up if there's anyone that's
really into this stuff.  Or maybe its really easy to get?  I dunno.

Shouts to all Atomic punters - WOO HOO - that was a fun one.

Anyone buy/read this book yet?  I gave it a once over @ Barns &
Nobles....it looked like it was good for a laugh at least, with i think
more than one chapter devoted to drum + bass.  Simon Reynolds
writes for 'the Wire' and the stuff I've read of his is well written but
damn annoying in some way or another.  He's overanalytical of
something that needs to be experienced to be understood.

on da porn tip...

so i'm on my lunch break @ work (lemme tell yah friggin workin 12
hour daze as an account executive sucks!) and i notice on the cover
of THE OTHER PAPER Columbus's News & Entertainment Weekly...
TOPLESS at BROAD & HIGH - Police Stand By as Dancer Struts Her
Stuff...apparently Porn Star Adaka Michaels walked through downtown
completely topless handing out flyers, promoting for her show @ the 
Excalibur Club...the best part wuz that the cops didn't do anything about 
it because 3 years ago, the police arrested 6 topless females at the 
1995 Gay Pride Parade...the columbus's public indecency law says: no
person should "recklessly"...expose private parts...and in 1991 Hamilton
County Court of Appeals ruled that breasts are not private parts...the
police not only had to drop the charges, but ended up paying five of them
$15,000 in out-of-court suits...it was a women's right issue: if men can
take off their shirts in public, it's only fair if women could do the same...
of course, HARD COPY, INSIDE EDITION, and REAL TV were in on the action!

oh shit, i forgot i've got to make this rave related for the list, uhm, ok...

Titonton Duvante with the Marzipian Ensemble will be doing a live P.A.,

everything i've read by that guy seems like a whack-ass academic

more about through such methods.

i agree that rave culture needs to be experienced to be understood, but as
a communications major, i'll probably be doing a similar study on the
channels of communication and power in the scene. you can call it
overly analytical, but i call it scholarly and interesting. it's a closer
look at something we all know and love, but rarely take the time to
*really* think about.   sorry...i just
feel the need to defend this type of study/writing. i've never read the
book, and i don't know if it's any good, tho.

I don't mean to put a damper on any writing on the rave scene - hell i do
it myself!  If that moves you - do it!  I'd rather see it done from the
inside out than outside in.

I just think Simon Reynolds extrapolates and generalizes in
ways that, while are interesting, miss 'essense' of what he's trying
to talk about in favor of being 'discrete theories'. And sometimes i
plain disagree. But that's ok.  I'll prob get his book from the library if
they ever get it. His stuff is about 10 million times better than stuff in
say 'Time' or 'Newsweek' or 'Fox News with Leslie Polatta'.

Ok kiddies, I'm posting from the bee-yoo-tee-fool computer cluster in
Baker Hall (I think) at CMU, courtesy of our beloved Spike.  The tables at
the Fence closed down around 8:30 or 9pm because there weren't many people
there.  Now we're going over to Sip on Spahr St. in Shadyside.  Ed Ummmm
will be spinning (always a pleasure).  Dan Strange will be spinning
(man,he's the strangest).  MSKW1 will be spinning (come see his new
haircut).  Coffee is great.  Food is great, especially for you vegans in
the crowd.  Music is great.  You know you want to.  Besides this will be
the absolutely last chance you burgher ravers will get to see my gorgeous
baby blues until Winter break.  Talk about incentive!

Maaan! None of you guys have seen Tom dance unless you've seen him do
the "fat guy dance" behind the tables while mixing out of some jazzy
song into "No Diggety"  It brought a tear to my eye ;)

I don't even know who to describe it except that it involves a little
pointing and moving like a fat guy :)

Hey Everyone.... 
I so wish that I could.... I had the most terrible thing happen to me last
evening. I was loading my stuff into my car to go to a high school football
game, and I left my organizer on top of my car just for a second to load my
stuff. Fate would have it that I left that organizer on top of my car, and I
forgot all about it. Now, I have no: money (cash, atm card, credit cards,
checkbook all in there), ID (Driver's License, Social Security card, all
Student ID's all in there), and various other stuff.  I am so mad at myself,
how could I be so stupid? A split second lapse in judgement, or thought,
whatever, has cost me all of this. I only had eighty bucks in there, and the
person who finds it cant use any of the cards (had them all reported) or
checks (had them stopped), but now I am penniless til Monday when I can get to
my Credit Union/Bank. This just sucks. Sorry I unloaded on all of you, but I
needed to do it somewhere. 

I hope those of you that go have a great time, wherever you go tonight. I was
either going to go to Detroit, or to Bauhaus here in Cleveland... Did anyone
go to see Jeno last night??? How was Be There? Everyone be safe!!! Peace..
Casey

Hey kids!! 
   I had a wonderful time at this party:):) I cannot stress how much I 
enjoyed the re-entry and being able to chill outside and cool off!! The 
music was "off the hook"!!!! It was kinda crowded, but the vibe was 
pretty good...except for the rude,obnoxious,perverted guys in the womens 
bathroom, that either would try to hit on every girl that stepped foot 
into the bathroom or make fun of them really rudley,but other than that 
it was great!!!
pLuR,
jessica

black backpack. I'll be wearing very dark blue (almost black) pants and
a black button-up shirt with flames on the sleeves. I'm about 5'6" with
bleach-blonde hair,  goatee,  and sideburns. (How about that for a
little descrip) How about the usual 2AM, main stage deal...ok? I'll be
there then. Hope to see some of you guys up there! Look for the orange
pb-cle sign! peace

i brought my friends to this event to support walt & the local
ohio dj's, but instead i was completely dismayed as to how
completely shady the scene has become...

some time last night, i don't know when because i took drinks
from so many people's water bottles...i was slipped some, what
i believe to be K, i spent most of the night sitting on a chair,
because i found it so difficult to move...my fingers became numb
and i had a difficult time communicating with people who were
trying to talk to me...finally when i mustered enough will power
to get off my ass & make it to the car, i noticed i had lost alot of
my motor coordination skills...i spent the rest of the night in my car 
in a k-hole...i'm sorry, but this is straight up, fucked up!!!...

i don't care what degree of shade u may be involved in or how 
greedy u are or what kind of wack lies u want to believe in, but this is
just completely EVIL!...i wouldn't even do this to my worst enemies...

open your eyes people...to what's REALLY going on...

it's not worth selling your soul over...

Had a prety good time at "Be There", I passed out candy with my girl friend
and got to meet a lot of people.  I wished there was more room for dancing but
in general the vibe made up for it.  This rave should have been called get wet

I think I'm gonna be in detroit this weekend. Any happenings there? 
I dunno, how about the weekend after labor day, anything going on 
here is Cleveland? I'd love to goto something, haven't been to a party
all summer. :(

I also will be able to give rides to eastsiders, in areas like Chardon,
Wickliff, WIlloughby, Eastlake, Chesterland, Mentor, Mayfield, and places
on the way to cleveland from chardon. 

Yeah, later guys.

ps. i start school monday, senior year - hopefully going to new york on 
      our senior trip (please please please god).

     this is the first week since LIBAD that i haven't
     been to at least one rave over the weekend. trust me,
     it's a change for the worse, and i don't intend to
     let it happen again for a while... :]

     well, atomic was nice, anyway. scott henry spun a fast,
     tight set, which altho not quite to my taste was none-
     the-less tasty :] mega ups to randy for working the 
     lights very nicely throughout his set. more of this, ok?

     for some reason i had the bright idea to consume a hit
     at approximately 12:30am, and spent the rest of the 
     night in my apartment watching the floral patterns on
     the rug nibble at my feet, and cursing myself for 
     leaving my tangerine dream collection in my old apartment.
     instead, i had to settle for the prodigy, which kept 
     conjuring up visions of rows of shouting, dancing, 
     black-clad figures all wearing oakleys and grinning.

     note: driving a stickshift coming on to acid sucks 
     big-time. becoming one with your car is one thing,
     becoming one with oncoming traffic is another. however,
     i've never done acid, so i wouldn't know. <cough>

     um.

     other than that, my life has pretty much sucked. i've
     been preoccupied with my family: my dad showed up last
     weekend and has alternated between shouting at me,
     going on mad guilt trips, and throwing my phat pants in
     the trash. it's been very emotionally distressing and
     i haven't been able to concentrate on much else. it 
     might sound amusing but it's not. BTW that's the main
     reason behind the postponement of 'ancient history'.
     sorry guys. hopefully it'll be over by tomorrow; we
     managed to reach an agreement this weekend. this won't
     happen again, i promise.

     the reason behind this i guess is my religious 
     background, which i will not expound on here. 

     anyone go to sunrise festival? somebody tell about
     detroit, please? tell me they both sucked and i'll 
     feel better.

     hugs
     sad.geek.boy

That sucks pretty bad! Amanda and I went and had a pretty good time.
We didn't stay too long because it started raining again and the 
inside of the building got too crowded to dance anymore, but it
was still a reasonably fun party. How did someone wind up slipping
you enough K to fuck you up? It seems like you would have noticed
the taste or something if it were in a bottle you drank from. Just
wondering. Nobody should have that kind of shit happen to them
at a party. I don't know, everyone there seemed pretty friendly to
me, maybe you just had some bad luck.

Hey, try to watch Telebellies on acid, (not that i ever did it {;-)  I heard
that it is the silliest thing you ever saw, if you are looking for something
more intellectually stimulating try "Talk Soup" on E-television network.  I
also wanted to say hi to Wendy who I ran into at BE THERE, I hope she knows by
now I am not a NARC. By the way to the person that got slipped some K in the
water bottle, I would suggest remembering where you put your bottle, you might
have taken someone's planed K trip.

    Well....here's how it went down kids...

    Benny (Ha Ha) drove up saturday afternoon from Columbus to meet me
in Kent. We hung out for a little while and decided to leave at 7PM for
Detroit. We had no idea if it was going to "sell out" or not. We hadn't
heard anything about the venue and neither of us even had a flyer for
the party. So we start driving and everything is great (Benny's the
best) until we get right outside of Toledo and POW!, one of my back
tires bursts. So, we pull off the side of the Turnpike and I put the
"donut wheel" on the car. We get off at the next exit to find a
replacement so we could still make it to Detroit. We eventually make our
way to a truck stop/ service station and the guy there calls some other
guy that sells tires, 24 hr service, for a price.......It ends up
costing $120 for the new tire and the "service call". I basically did
all the "service", though, except changing the rim. I ended up taking
$160 out of my bank account, leaving about $15 in there. After the tire
expense, I had about $45 and Benny had about $55. We finally make it to
Detroit around 1:30AM (6 1/2 hrs later) and we didn't even know how much
tickets were.....we promptly found out that they were $40!!! But it was
our lucky day.....on the way to the entrance a scalper asks us if we
want to buy tickets for $20 each and we said, "yep"! Considering our
financial situation, we had no other choice. After that we had just
enough money for "other things" and water. We left the party with about
$5 between the two of us....luckily someone bought a mask off me for $2.
That helped for the tolls on the way home. So, we finally made it back
to Kent around 10:30AM and Benny and I stayed up til around 2PM and then
finally went to sleep.......isn't it funny how things just work out
sometimes?

-matt

P.S.  The party was great! Lots of cool people, great space, and
wonderful lights and music! It was both Benny and mine's first Detroit
party and we had a blast!

P.P.S. I made sure that everyone there knew pb-cle was in the
house......orange signs were wavin' high in the air again and I had
another one attached to my backpack. We certainly showed those Detroit
kids how to party!

     i'm a little rushed right now but:

     this is basically an APB for the photos people 
     offered me for the rave cover story i'm doing. the
     deadline is basically this wednesday. please, could
     everyone who offered me photos (who is in a 1-hour
     radius of pgh) email me a time and a place when i
     can meet you to pick them up? thanks.

     also email me with your name as you would like to
     see it credited, plus the name of the rave where
     the pics were taken, and the date of same.

     i'll return the pics in reverse order once we get
     the story to press, probably friday.

     thankyou all in advance,
     geekboy

missing Jeno and Be There was truly upsetting Friday, but Save the Farm

basement was close to 80 degrees hotter than the upstairs, but the music 
was so much larger down there.  The vibe was really positive.  Everyone 
that i talked to seemed to be having a good time.  Akshun and Conspiracy 
got me up and movin and i didn't stop till 6 in the mo'nin. i still 
wanted to dance, but my back, legs, AND feet were failing on me!  blah.  
it was good though cuz i got to meet more ppl sittin along the wall 
restin.  when i couldn't stand anymore pain, there was only 2 kids 
dancin, one girl(Jill?) doin some beautiful dancin to the groovy beats 
and my boy Matt.  my only regret was missin out on the DJ's 
upstairs--the bits of sets i heard were tight, but there was no dancing 
room at all.  
I'm still hopin (barely) to go to Sensual, but i'm so drained right now 
that i probly shouldn't say for sure.  i'll be out of town saturday and 
sunDAY, but is anything goin on sunday night?  
i'm glad so many of you had a good time this weekend, and my heart goes 
out to anyone that didn't--i danced some for you too!

-Mike

:] ?

> There is the physiological death from the chemical itself and a death by

i think what this means is the 1st example is dying as a direct physical
reaction to a drug (fatal overdose), and the 2nd is the person on it dies
indirectly by either freaking out so much they have a heart attack or that
type of thing or thinking that they can fly or walk thru fire or something
and then trying to do something impossible.

the first type cannot happen on acid but the 2nd type definitely can, and
has many times. that depends almost totally on the mental state of the
person on it, and the amount of the dose is not so important, except in
the case of something like driving under the influence. but in the case of
bad acid, none of this applies probably.

is there any relation between the possiblities of physical addiction to 
any drugs and of fatally overdosing on them?

well at first it looked bad.  we got to the space, it was a small narrow
warehouse dividing a huge lot in half.  2 rooms outdoors and it started
raining to boot.  this was at 4pm.  the ppl there gave us direx to
recordtime so we headed there and killed time (alot, i felt bad for hednist
coz we took forever in there!) and ate and got to the lot at 9ish to be
charged 5$ to park.  and a line was forming already.  they didnt start
letting ppl in for 2 hrs and we met lots of ppl there.  i guess its true
what they say about detroit kids not going to detroit parties, coz most
everyone i met wasnt local????  the door was 40$, thats kinda what i
expected (35$ was my guess) coz there was no price on the flyer/book.  most
djs were good, but there were a couple really lousy ones, didnt get most of
their names.  RITM was awesome, i forgot how good their stage show &
presence is coz its been a few yrs since i've seen them.  r.a.w. ripped
shit up in the jungle room. and ectomorph was pretty good, but a rather
short set.   monk should have been shut off, he couldn't stick to one style
of music and was all over the place with no apparent attempt at a coherent
set.  but at least there was 2 other rooms to watch...  the best thing i
saw the whole nite was a guy and a girl dancing on the porta-shitters, i
even took a piss in the one the guy was on and was banging on the roof at
him.  damn crazy kids!  it was a blast but kinda real pricey, but i've
always wanted to get up there to see what it was really like.
trouty.

Kiddies:

Finally put the effort into making a slightly better looking 
TECHNOLOGY website, and adding some new content.  The 'damn it took
forever to make this' paper style issue will be out soon - and it will be
personally delivered to those who've been promised one for so long.

http://www.pitt.edu/~gmmst22/technology.htm

I'm a bit behind on events...i left some things off for this weekend
because I wasn't planning to release the site till then.  

If anyone wants to write reviews or have reviews posted, just let me know
- I appriciate it and you get credit of course.  Also, if you've got any
info to pass along or demos/tapes/cd/vinyl that you want reviewed, send
em' my way.

One thing that I'm trying to do in here is have 'police reports' - ie.
what encounters with law enforcement happen at an event.  I'm looking to
at least have a record of what went down at events that were shut down, or
positive things that cops have done if it happens.  Lemme know if you have
any tales to tell.

Of course, you shutter-bug kids and graphics phreaks - send me your
creations and i'll put them up.  I have access to about 5 different
scanners as well as a VHS to avi digitizer.  

Oh yeah i'm also adding the DJ top 10's and soon a dj contact list - so
djs send me your picks.

Gotta for now.

Subject: {pb-cle} Disney hoax (was: Disney, let's go!)
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

AAAGH!  Another fucking imbecilic chain letter.

This is a HOAX.  I've received this from three separate people now,
all with more good intention than knowledge as to how the internet
works.  Or maybe I should say, with more greed than common sense.
No, wait, this message in my inbox is 669 lines... let's make it
laziness and ignorance as to why forwarding or replying to text
without trimming headers is baaaad.

I trimmed the headers and read all the comments.  "This seems to be
real", "someone checked this out", "it's worth a try seeing that the
big shot of MS is into this...".  It goes on and on.  Do any of you
remember the chain letter about forwarding so many thousand times
and then the Cancer Society would pay for the treatment of some
incurable illness for some poor kid?  Or how about so many thousand
forwards and Bill Gates himself will send you a check for who knows
how much.

Ugh.  It goes on and on.

Let's break it down into four issues and then analyze the letter
itself:

First of all, good scams work on the principle of being based on
something that people would want to believe anyway.  Like the
richest man on earth wanting to give away some of his money to you.
So stick Bill Gates' name or Microsoft in there somewhere.  Or pick
a huge corporation that people can identify with, like Disney.  Add
the human factor of laziness (not wanting to bother to try to figure
out if it's real), doubt ("well, it might be true...") and
nettiquite ignorance ("...and what harm is there in sending it even
if it isn't") ... and you have a guaranteed hit.

Secondly, it's technically _impossible_ to track what happens to
your mail after it leaves your ISP using current internet mail
transport technology.  It simply doesn't work that way.  I don't
care what claims they make or what fancy software they're using on
their end... unless every single message header is full and kept
intact, and then every letter is cc'd back to some collection
engine, it can't possibly know who got what.

Third, $6.5 million US cash and 11,7000 all-expense paid trips
(at another $23+ million) paid out... all to test some mail tracking
software?  Whatever.  If Microsoft and Disney are laying out $30
million in incentives for a world-wide testing program, you'd hear
about it elsewhere.

And finally... under the presumption of this fancy tracking
software, you wouldn't have to keep track of the headers... SO
FUCKING TRIM THEM.  Ugh.  This is what irritates me more than
anything.  Doing some rough calculations, if this thing were to go
out to 13,000 people it would take up something like 260 megabytes
of total text sent (assuming no or little trimming of headers)!
What a stupid waste.  Next time you try to access a website during
peak hours sometimes and notice how slow the net has become, when
compared even to a year or so ago, thank these assanine wanks and
their cool little chain letters... it's crap like this that makes
things more difficult for everyone.

The net is _not_ an infinite bandwith pipe.  We must all work
together to intelligently moderate our use and share our resources.
That being said...

The last two included text segments before the letter itself were
not attributable; that is to say, there wasn't an address or name
associated with them (gee, I wonder why):

>>>> >I called Disney my damn self.  It's no lie.  GET IT DONE!  You all
>>>> owe me.

>>>> >>>we've checked up on
>>>> >>>this and this is no joke of a chain letter or something

Umm-hmm.  And here's the letter... not "from" any address, just
included in someone else's letter:

:	My name is Walt Disney Jr.
:
:	Here at Disney we are working with Microsoft which has just
:	compiled an e-mail tracing program that tracks everyone to
:	whom this message is forwarded to. It does this through an
:	unique IP (Internet Protocol) address log book database We
:	are experimenting with this and need your help.

Unless you're running your own server or otherwise have made
arrangements with your ISP to provide you with what's known as a
"static IP", the IP that gets stamped on your outgoing mail is that
of the ISP's mail server.  That IP in no way is directly mapped to
your userID; you share it with who knows how many other people.

:       Forward
:	this to everyone you know and if it reaches 13,000 people,
:	1,300 of the people on the list will receive $5,000, and the
:	rest will receive a free trip for two to Disney World for
:	one week during the summer of 1999 at our expense. Enjoy.
:
:	Note: Duplicate entries will not be counted. You will be
:	notified by email with further instructions once this email
:	has reached 13,000 people.
:
:	Your friends, Walt Disney Jr., Disney, Bill Gates, & The
:	Microsoft Development Team.
:
:	The following is an attached File item from cc:Mail.  It
:	contains information that had to be encoded to ensure
:	successful transmission through various mail systems.  To
:	decode the file use the UUDECODE program.

There wasn't any file attached.  Not all mailers handle attachments
properly, especially in rebroadcasting (forwarding, replying, etc).
Even if they did, it wouldn't matter... because mailers don't
uuencode/decode during normal processing of mail.  The file would be
(hopefully) sent untouched... THEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE FILE?

Smoke and mirrors.  Greed and ignorance.

I've tried to provide some balm for the second ailment; you're up to
your own on the first.  ;)

Rave on.

hey, i was there ... it was pretty fun ... yeah, the basement was really hot
and stuffy - except for the few moments when i felt like going down there and
sweating from just standing there, i spent most of the time upstairs; that's
ok though because i really liked the music up there - for awhile it got turned
off; the cops showed up and the upstairs music had to be turned off and the
downstairs music turned way down - but once they left, it all got going again
- all and all, a fun night and a good experience - a good small intimate party
- i was wearing a v-neck white T-shirt and khaki cargo pants in case you saw
me; im like 5' 10", 165 and have brown regular boy hair - what did you look
like?

Just an update on the Tour.  I apologize in advance to any of you not
intersted in the tour or thinking this is some kind of ad or spam to the
list, because it's not.  Yes we are looking for promoters to hire the tour
in their city and yes we'd like to see all of you come out and enjoy.  We
are all energetic people interested in good vibes and fun times, and want
to share it with all of you.  Not all the dj's are "big" names in the
"industry".  They are all amazing, talented, devoted people that love what
they do, and it shows in their music.  We hope that you all can see it when
they play.  We are all involved in the internet and want to give internet
users a first look at what is coming together with the tour...

The tour is setup to make it easy on promoters. I can give anyone intersted
in details all the information they need.

Tour dates are coming together, so if your interested, please contact me as
soon as possible.  The tour is set to start on New Years Eve and run until
early march.

    Well....once again I'm settin' up a net meet. This time it's for
Liquid on saturday. It's the usual drill. E-mail me if you're going and
we'll have another wonderful net-meet in front of the main stage around
2AM. This party is gunna be great and rumor has it it's at the skating
place, one of my favorite Cleveland spaces. The orange pb-cle signs will
again be wavin high in the air. Look for me, I'll have one attached to
my backpack. Make and bring your own too to let everyone know that
pb-cle is in the house.
