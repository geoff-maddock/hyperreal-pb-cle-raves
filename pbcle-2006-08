Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Yes the sound will be going the entire time.  You will not be able to park next to your tent, but the camp area is next to the parking area.  Depending on the flow of traffic during the time people come in you may or may not be able to drive your vehicle to your camp spot to dump your gear.  It is at our descretion at that specific time.  Whatever works out to be the safest & most efficient for everyone.  The same goes for the staking of camp area.  If there is plenty of room for you to do it at that time, then that's fine.  But if we start running out of room for tent set ups & your area isn't filled in yet then you would have to remove the stakes.  If for some reason some one feels like bitching about your researved camp area, then you would also have to allow other campers.  See you at Frequency & bring the good vibes!
                                                                                     Peace, Cathy

  Thanks for the reply :)

I guess I havnt figured out yet whether the sound is going 72 hrs
straight or what?

After the dissapointment of wemf shutting down all the stages at
midnight friday, that's the only thing that makes me even want to
think about bringing renegade stuff. There are so many pimp djs here
anyways. It much easier just to not have it though. I hate the damn
generator noise anyways.

Whatever happens its all good :) I think I'll be in front of line
anyhow :) I think I'll prolly know half the people there anyways so I
dont think It'll be possible to be isolated or anything. Heck if I did
wemf I can do this much better :) I'll prolly just bring a few tarps
to throw down for my ppl next to my tent and it'll be all good :)

One last question: Do you know if we'll be able to drive to our tent
spot, dump our junk then park or are we hauling it all on foot from
the parking lot to the camping spot? I just want to know how to pack
all my gear :)

I'm so psyched for this...

<div>Yes the sound will be going the entire time.&nbsp; You will not be able to park next to your tent, but the camp area is next to the parking area.&nbsp; Depending on the flow of traffic&nbsp;during the time&nbsp;people come in you may or may not be able to drive your vehicle to your camp spot to dump your gear.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;at our descretion at that specific time.&nbsp; Whatever works out to be the safest &amp; most efficient for everyone.&nbsp; The same goes for the staking of camp area.&nbsp; If there is plenty of room for you to do it at that time, then that's fine.&nbsp; But if we start running out of room for tent set ups &amp; your area isn't filled in yet then you would have to remove the stakes.&nbsp; If for some reason some one feels like bitching about your researved camp area, then you would also have to allow other campers.&nbsp; See you at Frequency &amp; bring the good vibes!</div>

 bringing a 6kwatt<BR>&gt; generator, A few of us are bringing blenders... I have a lantern and<BR>&gt; stove. I wish someone had a stand alone ice maker? Anyone? Anyhow<BR>&gt; there's gonna be a bunch of us there, a mix of PBCLE people and<BR>&gt; friends of PBCLE people, alot of my younger pgh friends as well.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Basically this all started out from about a dozen of us that all<BR>&gt; managed to find eachother at WEMF and actually got our tents next to<BR>&gt; eachother. We partied hard and vowed to repeat at FF and have even<BR>&gt; more fun. (I'm POSITIVE we will!) The name of Kamp Krater is derived<BR>&gt; from what happened within a few hours of getting our tents set up at<BR>&gt; wemf, and later at our hotel after we left wemf before we rode back.<BR>&gt; Anyhow all PBCLErs that party and have an open mind are welcome to<BR>&gt; join us... I'll be with my wife Adrienne in a beige with blue rainfly<BR>&gt; tent that's 20'x10' and slightly triangular
 shaped. I shouldn't be far<BR>&gt; from the Kamp Krater Flag. Please come say hi! (And introduce yourself<BR>&gt; if we havn't met!)<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; BrandyMandyCandy is making a flag / banner that will say 'Kamp Krater'<BR>&gt; and may or may not say PB/CLE as well. If you want to party hard, find<BR>&gt; that and get kinda close but not too close cause all the inside spots<BR>&gt; are prolly already taken by those of us planning this and carrying<BR>&gt; over from our WEMF tent circle. maybe park your tent with enough room<BR>&gt; to put another tent between you and the middle. If you're not looking<BR>&gt; to party hard or want some peace and quiet, then look for our flag and<BR>&gt; put your tent far far away from it.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Anyhow alot of us are buying $20 sets of 2-way radios so we can keep<BR>&gt; in touch on the way to the party, and once you get there to find the<BR>&gt; tent circle, and during the party to locate friends, and etc... it<BR>&gt; was tons of
 fun with these at WEMF and probably will be too at FF.<BR>&gt; They have 10 mile range and are $20 for a set of 2, the ones we got<BR>&gt; take AAA batteries although the package doesnt say... So go in with a<BR>&gt; friend and they are 10 bucks each. We'll be on channel 21 subchannel<BR>&gt; 0.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; You can find more info about the exact brand / model of radio most of<BR>&gt; us have, and everything else about the tent circle at<BR>&gt; http://groups.myspace.com/FrequencyFest that's a group for<BR>&gt; the Kamp<BR>&gt; Krater tent circle.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Plz let me know if you wanna join our circle? so I can try and reserve<BR>&gt; a big enough spot. maybe include how big ur tent is and if you're<BR>&gt; bringing anything else that has to go outside of your tent that's<BR>&gt; bigger than say 2 camping chairs.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; I would love to get permission from someone associated with the event<BR>&gt; to get in early and stake out our spot if possible? Id like
 to have<BR>&gt; that staked out until like 11pm on friday and after that if the area's<BR>&gt; not full remove the stakes and let everyone come who wants... either<BR>&gt; that or as soon as the place starts getting full of tents, remove our<BR>&gt; stakes. Does anyone know anyone affiliated with the event that might<BR>&gt; have the capability of granting this small request? We'd just like to<BR>&gt; be as far away from the stages as possible in case we make too much<BR>&gt; noise or want to do a little renegade stage. It would also be nice to<BR>&gt; be kinda close to some trees... I'm not asking for prime location just<BR>&gt; contiguous space. If thats not possible I totally understand, it's all<BR>&gt; good :) I dunno how crowded it's going to get? I'm just raelly nervous<BR>&gt; after wemf when basically every single plot of land that could<BR>&gt; possible fit a tent or car had a tent or car on it. no one could tent<BR>&gt; by eachother... With the sick ass lineup
 and very reasonable price for<BR>&gt; FF I wouldnt be surprised to see it PACKED!<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Does anyone know if we'll be able to drive our cars up to our tent and<BR>&gt; drop stuff off or are we hauling it all by hand from our car to where<BR>&gt; we want to pitch?<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; If anyone has the capability of making on site, a baloon that floats<BR>&gt; so that we can tie our flag to it, and tether it down, and you plan on<BR>&gt; getting there early, that would be awesome, get at me.<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt; Anyhow, most of this is alot of dreaming... whatever happens Im gonna<BR>&gt; have fun and hope ppl come introduce themselves to me... many of you<BR>&gt; I've been to more than one party that you were at and I never<BR>&gt; recognised you or were introduced (Jea leigh, boompsie, few others).<BR>&gt; I'll look just like my myspace pic at<BR>&gt; http://www.myspace.com/raver_dan_K so come up and say hi<BR>&gt; plz if you<BR>&gt; see me there.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Frequency Fest - Roll Call, Kamp Krater Tent Circle

Yeah i remember at everyone gets laid having to lug a huge cooler  
full of ice to the campsite.  That reminds me, are there going to be  
any "hidden" fees like a corking charge that was at EGL?  that was  
super annoying, not because there was one, but because no one ever  
mentioned until we got there and was like "ohh, you have a case of  
beer?" *calls in to whoever* "7 bucks" (or whatever parking + extra  
cost was).  I'm guessing they did that at EGL because they plastered  
FREE all over the flyer but then charge for everything else.

So I have my ticket in hand, could I theoretically drive up there  
without a penny to my name and not have to worry about a parking/ 
camping/corking/whatever fee?

There are definetly no hidden fees.  If your coming with not a penny to your name, then make sure your stocked up on food & H20.  Please keep hydrated.
                                                                              Peace, Cathy

So I have my ticket in hand, could I theoretically drive up there 
without a penny to my name and not have to worry about a parking/ 
camping/corking/whatever fee?

I have a lantern and<BR>&gt; &gt; stove. I wish someone had a stand alone ice maker? Anyone? Anyhow<BR>&gt; &gt; there's gonna be a bunch of us there, a mix of PBCLE people and<BR>&gt; &gt; friends of PBCLE people, alot of my younger pgh friends as well.<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; Basically this all started out from about a dozen of us that all<BR>&gt; &gt; managed to find eachother at WEMF and actually got our tents next to<BR>&gt; &gt; eachother. We partied hard and vowed to repeat at FF and have even<BR>&gt; &gt; more fun. (I'm POSITIVE we will!) The name of Kamp Krater is derived<BR>&gt; &gt; from what happened within a few hours of getting our tents
 set up at<BR>&gt; &gt; wemf, and later at our hotel after we left wemf before we rode back.<BR>&gt; &gt; Anyhow all PBCLErs that party and have an open mind are welcome to<BR>&gt; &gt; join us... I'll be with my wife Adrienne in a beige with blue <BR>&gt; rainfly<BR>&gt; &gt; tent that's 20'x10' and slightly triangular shaped. I shouldn't <BR>&gt; be far<BR>&gt; &gt; from the Kamp Krater Flag. Please come say hi! (And introduce <BR>&gt; yourself<BR>&gt; &gt; if we havn't met!)<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; BrandyMandyCandy is making a flag / banner that will say 'Kamp <BR>&gt; Krater'<BR>&gt; &gt; and may or may not say PB/CLE as well.

 you and the middle. If you're not <BR>&gt; looking<BR>&gt; &gt; to party hard or want some peace and quiet, then look for our <BR>&gt; flag and<BR>&gt; &gt; put your tent far far away from it.<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; Anyhow alot of us are buying $20 sets of 2-way radios so we can keep<BR>&gt; &gt; in touch on the way to the party, and once you get there to find the<BR>&gt; &gt; tent circle, and during the party to locate friends, and etc... it<BR>&gt; &gt; was tons of fun with these at WEMF and probably will be too at FF.<BR>&gt; &gt; They have 10 mile range and are $20 for a set of 2, the ones we got<BR>&gt; &gt; take AAA batteries although the package doesnt say...

sweet, thanks.

Also I've found ensure is great stuff when you know you should be  
eating but don't feel like it.  although it may be me but I have to  
down a bottle of gatorade right afterwards because my mouth feels too  
dry.  At least it doesn't look like it's going to be too bad this  
weekend (like mid 80s).  At least it's not going to be this humid 90+  
weather.

It was $7/car to get in.  They had five or so areas of sound.

Near as I can tell, they realized that they were waaaay short on cash
to pay for things like 'generators' and 'speaker rental', as they got
about 500 people, and they expected more.

So they tacked on a few extra charges, like a few bucks if you brought beer.

All around, an awesome fucking night...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Frequency Fest - Roll Call, Kamp Krater Tent Circle

i still remember the sky from that night... it was clear and had
really cool ass high atmosphere clouds with a full (almost full?) moon
out that night.  i remember listening to some glitch techno on the
"house/breaks" stage at around 3am, just staring at the sky.  that was
worth the money.

i actually donated 10 dollars to the party above what i paid to get in
cause i knew they didnt have a great turnout vs. expectations.  it's
one thing to accept donations, it's another to impose a corking fee
when you didnt say anything about it prior to that.

that's the promoter's fault for not planning accordingly, and shouldnt
be a burden placed upon the party patrons.

it's just bad business.  you deliver what you promise, if you're not
organized enough to take precautions if turnout is low (like
pre-mentioning additional fees), then you need to take the loss.  as a
worst case scenario, ask for a corking fee _donation_ as well as
asking for additional donations from the patrons during the party.
(but not going around and around, just hitting each area once during
peak hours or announcing during DJ swaps).

Being constantly asked for money was very annoying as well as being 
repeatedly told to go to the stage to watch the dj that lost money spin. and 
those annoyances were the worst hidden fees of all. other than that i had a 
decent time.

Well, upstairs is Breaker Kelly's new thursday night weekly event, and
downstairs is the everynight type thing, usually residents mostly.
Upstairs is never residents, usually special events. I'll try like
hell to make it to support you and kelly but somehow I know there wont
be enough time to get ready for FF (Just like WEMF was).

Oh yeah, not that it makes much of a difference to me, upstairs is $3
cover and downstairs is free :)

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

champ)
DJ Sparechange will go head to head against Dj Topspeed in an
exhibition dj battle. The two are close friends and the results of the
battle will be up to the crowd. Undoubtedly both of them will come
with the OG heat and the match will be to close to call.

LA QUEST
La Quest is a band that recognizes its roots, yet comes completely
fresh by combining the respect for where they came from with a newness
and vitality unique to the Urban scene of their time. They combine
influences that range as far back in the past as 1950s Motown, Soul
and Blues, to present day Hip-Hop, R&B and Jazz, and to the future
with an original vision thats a synthesis of whats to come. The unique
sound that results was explained in a recent article in Columbus Other
Paper by staff writer Rick Allen:

Opening a night full of musical and artistic bliss:

Phatts McNatt (Live Drum & Bass / Breakbeat / Funk)

Read on from their MySpace profile:
A two man group that got this distinctive sound by conglomerating a vast 
amount of their influences into a funnel that is constantly evolving and 
digesting their musical hypotheses. They have taken different recipes 
from the Red hots, Fishbone and Primus. They have then taken aromatic 
and flavorfull spices from all around the world from the likes of Aierto 
Moreira, Ray Brown, Horacio Hernandez, Herbie Hancock, The Police, Bob 
Marley and the Wailers, Aphex Twin, Parliament, Bootsy Collins, Trilok 
Gurtu, DJ Shadow, Miles Davis, Freddy Hubbard, Eric Dolphy, Bjork, 
Living Colour, Paul chambers, Elvin Jones, Kenny Garret, Steve Gadd, 
Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Dre and Snoop, along with many, many others - 
construing them together ending up in a thick, chowder-like mass of 
groove oriented , wrongfully right, high octane sounds.

Artist Biography: Dustin Zahn

After being influenced by mix-tapes of artists such as Richie Hawtin, 
Dustin began writing music purely for fun. Dustin met future-partner Ian 
Lehman, who was established in the mid-west rave scene. Ian explained to 
him that music similar to his was played at parties called raves. Ian 
invited him to one of his shows and Dustin took his offer to see what he 
was talking about. After being exposed to just one party, Dustin knew 
this was his future. He started doing Live PA.s at various local parties 
and quickly became a favorite. After a year Dustin stepped up to the 
decks and won just as much respect as he did with his productions.

    In early 2001, Dustin and Ian both agreed to take things to the next 
level. They put a halt on bookings and concentrated on the studio. A 
year later their work had emerged onto vinyl and all over the internet, 
creating a serious buzz. Abiotic was born and the duo formed The Attack 
People.

A few words can easily describe Dustin Zahn's style: moody, tribal, 
dark, and hypnotic. Since Dustin co-founded Abiotic Recordings with Ian 
Lehman in 2001, he's finished projects for labels such as Invasion, 
Mankind, Compound, GFR, Humanoid, and many other labels. His tracks have 
received support from techno DJs such as Adam Beyer, Ben Sims, Chris 
Liebing, Dave Clarke, Umek, Cari Lekebusch, Patrik Skoog, and countless 
more. Together with partner Ian Lehman they perform a Live PA under the 
moniker "The Attack People." A project concentrating on moody, 
futuristic funk for both the mind and dance floor. Zahn is also known 
for his diverse DJ sets which have brought him all over the U.S., to 
Europe, and South America.

ZOMFGBBQPIEBANANAPHONE!!   so what records are you going to have him  
sign :)   hmm.. what records could I bring for him to sign :D

Dude, you should do it reverse trout-core style (heh, kinky), where  
instead of starting with a slow tempo and working up, start playing  
like gabber and stuff and then towards the end play a couple stay up  
forever tracks :)

Or I guess keep the tempo up high and see if he rides it :D

Of just play rockabilly

i dont think it would be possible for me to slow down a set!

> Or I guess keep the tempo up high and see if he rides it :D

haha yeah

> Of just play rockabilly 

i do have a few cowslinger records that would be pretty appropriate for 
a party (stripbars liquor and fireworks by the cowslingers comes 
immediately to mind)

looking at the timeslots this way I made a quick spreadsheet with all
the stages lined up and exported it to a PDF file.

Vegas played a phat set.
Had a good time talking about the physics of nitrous.

I thought Vegas was boring as fuck.  Mayhem was ok, I would have been into
it had the system been bangin.  I wanted to kill Ewun after about an hour.
God I'm such a hater anymore ;)  I caught about a half hour of the band the
Boogie Hustlers (I think) they were accually pretty dope.  Didn't catch any
other headliners.

All in all I had a good time, I was pretty much hammered the whole time.
Mushrooms, Skunk, Hemp cookies, quarter barrel and 4 different kinds of
liquer did the trick for me.

Didn't see Trout or much of the oh-10 crew at all.  Did you guys not make
it?

RAVE ON,

Adam

yeah, we were there from friday to sunday, there were alot of akron 
heads there, saw some ppl from youngstown but not sure if you know them, 
newer ravers.  we were kamped out by the BBM stage. maybe about 150 feet 
from it?

i had a really awesome friday, and was in a poopy mood sat for no reason 
in particular so kept to myself alot because i didn't want to bring 
anyone down. but by late sat/earlier sunday was in a better mood.  we 
ended up watching pretty much everyone else leave and were some of the 
last to leave.  it was just a chill afternoon talking to everyone.  all 
in all a great party, alot of great music, this video clip of nate makes 
me laugh a whole lot, after this he was running around the field chasing 
ravers with the light saber, i should have followed him around.  all in 
all it was alot of kraziness the whole weekend.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Just added!
Opening a night full of musical and artistic bliss:

Phatts McNatt (Live Drum & Bass / Breakbeat / Funk)

Read on from their MySpace profile:
A two man group that got this distinctive sound by conglomerating a vast 
amount of their influences into a funnel that is constantly evolving and 
digesting their musical hypotheses. They have taken different recipes 
from the Red hots, Fishbone and Primus. They have then taken aromatic 
and flavorfull spices from all around the world from the likes of Aierto 
Moreira, Ray Brown, Horacio Hernandez, Herbie Hancock, The Police, Bob 
Marley and the Wailers, Aphex Twin, Parliament, Bootsy Collins, Trilok 
Gurtu, DJ Shadow, Miles Davis, Freddy Hubbard, Eric Dolphy, Bjork, 
Living Colour, Paul chambers, Elvin Jones, Kenny Garret, Steve Gadd, 
Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Dre and Snoop, along with many, many others - 
construing them together ending up in a thick, chowder-like mass of 
groove oriented , wrongfully right, high octane sounds.

Artist Biography: Dustin Zahn

After being influenced by mix-tapes of artists such as Richie Hawtin, 
Dustin began writing music purely for fun. Dustin met future-partner Ian 
Lehman, who was established in the mid-west rave scene. Ian explained to 
him that music similar to his was played at parties called raves. Ian 
invited him to one of his shows and Dustin took his offer to see what he 
was talking about. After being exposed to just one party, Dustin knew 
this was his future. He started doing Live PA.s at various local parties 
and quickly became a favorite. After a year Dustin stepped up to the 
decks and won just as much respect as he did with his productions.

    In early 2001, Dustin and Ian both agreed to take things to the next 
level. They put a halt on bookings and concentrated on the studio. A 
year later their work had emerged onto vinyl and all over the internet, 
creating a serious buzz. Abiotic was born and the duo formed The Attack 
People.

A few words can easily describe Dustin Zahn's style: moody, tribal, 
dark, and hypnotic. Since Dustin co-founded Abiotic Recordings with Ian 
Lehman in 2001, he's finished projects for labels such as Invasion, 
Mankind, Compound, GFR, Humanoid, and many other labels. His tracks have 
received support from techno DJs such as Adam Beyer, Ben Sims, Chris 
Liebing, Dave Clarke, Umek, Cari Lekebusch, Patrik Skoog, and countless 
more. Together with partner Ian Lehman they perform a Live PA under the 
moniker "The Attack People." A project concentrating on moody, 
futuristic funk for both the mind and dance floor. Zahn is also known 
for his diverse DJ sets which have brought him all over the U.S., to 
Europe, and South America.

18 to enter

Ive been noticing a bit of bad feelings in the scene lately so we at 
goodvibes decided that its time for another go, another reminder that 
the vibe is still here, that it doesnt have to be found in a warehouse 
or under a bridge. It can still be found right here. Its the people that 
make the vibe, not the venue. So I urge you, once again and feel the 
vibe. No drama, no hate, just old fashioned good vibes.

This is pretty cool, but I'm rather dissapointed that it was DJ Tiesto
that was performing in this.  Shouldn't a rave in Rotterdam have some
fucking hardcore?!

Subject: {pb-cle} Create music using a cd player

Create music using a cd player?

http://www.realmdekor.com/products/accessories/randomCD.htm

Which is a pretty cool Idea I wish I had thought of first.

I'm thinking you could extend the idea with each track being a short
loop/sample... each CD creating a certain tempo / style. mebby that
wouldnt work so well with real cd seek times though...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Create music using a cd player

I'd so get that.. if it wasn't $21.  Although that's about par for a  
cd in Japan, maybe a little more.  I remember seeing dvd prices  
equivalent to $35 and that's the normal price, like 19.95 is here,  
now I see why anime dvds are so expensive (although still not $35).

I've thought about dan's idea though, having like 4 cdjs all with  
just a part of the song and mixing parts in and out.  Similar to when  
you see techno djs using 3 turntables, and actually using all 3 where  
all 3 are "live".  Which is extremely hard to pull off.  Figured it  
would be simpler with cdjs and make the tempo the same for  
everything.  Has anyone ever pulled off 4 turntables going at the  
same time? and not just using the 4th one for scratching or something?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Create music using a cd player

well, i'm pretty sure that i saw Barry Harris use at least 4 at a
time, he was playing on 8 decks (yes, rediculous - i know).. .he had 4
behind him and 4 in front of him.  Axis bar in columbus circa 98-99?

i dont know why you need 8 turntables for gay house (still the
cheesiest and most fun - like 80's music of EDM), but he was using
them.

nothing artistic about it though.

i'm now gonna go Dive In The Pool

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Jazz-e (SF) looking for a gig in Ohio 09.21-09.27

This is a little last minute but didn't finalize this
till a couple of days ago. I'm going to be in
Cleveland Ohio Area from August 21st thru the 27th and
was looking for a club to play at (Tues, Weds, Thurs,
Fri, Sat, even Sun). I was supposed to play in
Cleveland 6 years ago for DJ Mike Love but fell victim
to United Airline's strike and never made it out
there. Would love to pick up a couple of gigs last
minute if possible since no plane flights would be
necessary. If you are interested please contact via
e-mail at contact@jazz-e.com. If you would like to
listen to some mixed demo's you can listen online at
www.jazz-e.com or visit my myspace page
www.myspace.com/djjazze Hope to hear back from some of
you whether it be comments on the music or contact
info for a promoter. 

P.S. I owe Mike Love a dj set so if anyone can forward
this to him or give me his contact info I would
greatly appreciate it. Lost his info years ago and
would like to get back in touch.

Thanks Jazz-e

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Artist Biography: Dustin Zahn

After being influenced by mix-tapes of artists such as Richie Hawtin, 
Dustin began writing music purely for fun. Dustin met future-partner Ian 
Lehman, who was established in the mid-west rave scene. Ian explained to 
him that music similar to his was played at parties called raves. Ian 
invited him to one of his shows and Dustin took his offer to see what he 
was talking about. After being exposed to just one party, Dustin knew 
this was his future. He started doing Live PA.s at various local parties 
and quickly became a favorite. After a year Dustin stepped up to the 
decks and won just as much respect as he did with his productions.

    In early 2001, Dustin and Ian both agreed to take things to the next 
level. They put a halt on bookings and concentrated on the studio. A 
year later their work had emerged onto vinyl and all over the internet, 
creating a serious buzz. Abiotic was born and the duo formed The Attack 
People.

A few words can easily describe Dustin Zahn's style: moody, tribal, 
dark, and hypnotic. Since Dustin co-founded Abiotic Recordings with Ian 
Lehman in 2001, he's finished projects for labels such as Invasion, 
Mankind, Compound, GFR, Humanoid, and many other labels. His tracks have 
received support from techno DJs such as Adam Beyer, Ben Sims, Chris 
Liebing, Dave Clarke, Umek, Cari Lekebusch, Patrik Skoog, and countless 
more. Together with partner Ian Lehman they perform a Live PA under the 
moniker "The Attack People." A project concentrating on moody, 
futuristic funk for both the mind and dance floor. Zahn is also known 
for his diverse DJ sets which have brought him all over the U.S., to 
Europe, and South America.

Ive been noticing a bit of bad feelings in the scene lately so we at 
goodvibes decided that its time for another go, another reminder that 
the vibe is still here, that it doesnt have to be found in a warehouse 
or under a bridge. It can still be found right here. Its the people that 
make the vibe, not the venue. So I urge you, once again and feel the 
vibe. No drama, no hate, just old fashioned good vibes.

Sep 15-17                      Earthdance 2006                  Central Il.

September 15, 16, 17 2006
Central Illinois, U.S.A.

E*A*R*T*H*D*A*N*C*E**2*0*0*6

We?ve come a long way and have found the reason we are who we are, and the
reason we do what we do. We have found many long-lost friends, and have made
so many new ones along the way.  Words can never describe the journey and
the journey will never be forgotten.  In commemoration of Earthdance 2006,
we have created just the right place, the right sounds, the right imagery,
and the right cause.  In beautiful rural Illinois, from Friday September
15th until Sunday September 17th the Trance Psyndicate invites YOU to be a
part of who we are, and to come see us inside.


A E S  D A N A   // LIVE - Lyons, France
Exclusive 3 hour Sunrise Set

Vincent Villuis, composer, deejay and Ultimae co-owner. His current project
::  Aes Dana :: stands as a coherent fusion of deep sounds rooted in the
atmospheric and psychedelic tradition, and a fluid down tempo morning
trance. Evocative sound textures, opening as a travelling over his
analogical dreams.  Short tales made of samples and waves, energised by
tribal beats. After the success of his latest album [ Memory Shell ], Aes
Dana continues to treat natural elements and weave kaleidoscopic sounds with
groovey and spacey backgrounds. He currently works on a musical score for 4
DVDs of NASA space imagery.


Yann - Tech Safari - Montreal, Quebec



Formerly known as DJ Dew, Yann was introduced to the underground electronic
scene in the early  90?s. These events were an eye opening experience and
filled him with a new musical sense. 1996 was a turning point for Yann, as
he started spinning and organizing parties with E.O.M.F. and subsequently
founded Cosmogony Concept.

At this point, the promoter has evolved into one of the most respected DJs
in Eastern Canada and is an active member of Techsafari Productions (Eclipse
International Festival). Today, Yann has a performance history that boasts
of over 200 major events throughout Canada. Additionally, he has been
resident at the Outer Limits monthly events at the legendary club
Playground, as well as at Yantra events (Interchill Records) and is
currently resident at the celebrated Amazone monthly events at the Society
for Art and Technology. On an international level, he has also been
contracted for events in Canada, the United States and in Morocco (Rythym of
Peace, Music of the Spheres, Full Moon, Club Darlah, Club Theatre O) and is
the North American representative for the German label Headroom Productions.
He is currently working on a compilation, Beta Sense, for the label, which
will be out in 2006.

Yann can read any crowd and each set he?s performed has provided him with
the opportunity to play alongside world-renowned talent such as X-Dream,
Hallucinogen, Astral Projection, Tim Shuldt, Absolum, Infected Mushroom,
Midmiliz, Dino Psaras, Son Kite, Deedrah, Ticon, Talamasca and many others.
His engaging unique sound blends groovy psychedelic trance with original,
percussive, banging beats and an impeccable mixing style.



Mahiane - Ultimae.Com - Lyons, France



Mahiane aka Sunny, co-owner and manager of Ultimae. Deejay and composer, she
participates to Aes Dana and occasionally H.U.V.A. Network. She recently
released [ Oxycanta ], a mix embodying the works of pioneers in the
exploration of a new style of electro-atmospheric ambient.


Gift Culture // LIVE - Dallas, Texas



The Gift Culture project is based on sounds, imagery, and art derived from
DSP technology, analogue synthesis, and computer-based non-linear editing.
As Gift Culture mastermind Michael Hale explains,

In this day and age, it is possible to sculpt light and sound as if they
were clay. Throw a midi-digitizer, sensors, and a video-sampler into the mix
and suddenly, you have the power to create fully immersive audio/visual
multimedia environments.

Gift Culture is the result - his attempts to share his explorations in this
multi-dimensional space; to evoke sonic textures from samplers,
synthesizers, and DSP algorithms that can only come from those things; a
journey to discover their "voices", so to speak, using such techniques as
granular synthesis, spectral resynthesis, FFT/IFFT based spectral morphing
and interpolation, and whatever other exotic algorithms he can coax out of
his myriad machines.


Psymbolic // LIVE - Chicago, Illinois



This catalytic duo (Julee & Troy) create Live Interactive Visual
Environments. Since 1999, they have become large-scale A/V event curators
and they continue to push their means of expression through their video
compositions and the realtime surrounding spectacles. Always providing a
customized thematic projection/performance of synchronous moments of meaning
and inspiration.



Cafrine  // LIVE - Tech Safari - Montreal, Quebec


Cafrine has been producing and mixing live video since 2001 and has been an
active member of the electronic music scene since 1998.

She first entered the field as a promoter for Felix the Katz, an underground
production company that threw a various number of events, from intimate
chill parties to larger ones, ranging from 100 to 1000 attendants and
focusing on audio-visual interactions. As a student of film and
communications, Cafrine was determined to marry her knowledge in video
production to these events.

Her goal as a VJ was to bring an imaged-based dimension to the music she
loved. She now creates and manipulates visual elements to live settings
using a variety of techniques, working simultaneously with several video
sources. Following her interest for new concepts, she has also worked in
with a variety of artists, such as DJs, musicians, painters, singers,
dancers and circus performers in order to create and even broader
interactive experience.

Cafrine has now performed at over 100 events for up to 10 000 participants
and developed a passion for a mix of colorful, organic, urban and dreamy
images. Now resident VJ for Techsafari?s legendary monthly Amazone nights at
the Society for Art and Technology, she has been working for three years
with the collective and has presented her creations in Montreal and on an
international level.


Alberto - Cosmic Traveler - Milano, Italy

Alberto has unique style, flawless performance skills, he is true
connoisseur of emotional driving tribal music. talented and methodical, he
creates intelligent soundscapes alternating melodic intensity and
compositional depth. Dance floor mayhem is guaranteed! Creative visual
artist and well known organizer, driving force behind Cosmic Traveler.  He
rocked our last full scale party, Cosmic Outset to no end and we are
extremely pleased to bring him back to invoke the madness all over again.


Dan Efex [D.N.X.] - Chicago, Illinois



dan efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out of
even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed shoulder
to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an energetic and
intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who consider him to
be one of the founders of the Midwest?s trance scene, a scene that is still
strong and growing today. He was one of the first to introduce the Midwest
to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions characteristic of some of
his styles of trance. But although Dan is perhaps best known for his trance,
do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as he is skilled! His repertoire of
past events includes sets with progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard
techno, hard core, hard house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it
up and keeps it interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and
know precisely what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind
on his musical excursions.


Professor X - Trance Psyndicate - Yuma, Arizona



The Professor is the leading authority on genetics, mutation, and psyonic
powers with considerable expertise in other life sciences.  He possesses a
strange, twisted fixation for inducing mental illusion.   As an integral
part of the Trance Psyndicate and its origin, we welcome him back to the
Midwest for digitally corrupted full-on madness.  :-)

Scotty Rotten - Trance Psyndicate - Miami, Florida



Did someone say Rotten?  One of the Trance Psyndicate?s long lost mentors
comes back to the Midwest for the first time in nearly 5 years.  Starting in
the Windy City, Scotty has been involved in the EDM culture since the early
nineties.  Working with several production crews in the Midwest, including
one of his own, he has played alongside some of the biggest names in the
United States Trance scene.  Hard. Trance. Redefined.  We?re glad to have
one of our main members BACK IN THE MIDWEST for this rare first-time
performance with his home crew.

This is being held on private rural property.  Please respect the venue, its
owners, and any neighboring towns and their laws.

The location is just outside of Metamora, Illinois -- We will be providing
the exact location, internet maps, and GPS coordinates very shortly.  Stay
posted to this page for that info.

There will be full-service vending, plenty of room for camping, hot showers,
a pond for swimming [if the weather is warm enough], room for children to
play safely, and plenty of open space for those beautiful midnight walks.
While there are no RV hookups, you can bring one or a camper for an extra
charge.  Advance arrangements will have to be made by contacting us
directly.

THIS IS A LEAVE NO TRACE EVENT.  Our mission is to return the venue to its
owners in the same, if not BETTER condition than it was.  As the owners have
said, ?leave only your footprints behind?.

Be prepared for rugged conditions.  This is on private property.  While we
have taken every single precaution to ensure that everyone will be able to
participate safely, we cannot emphasize enough how important plain common
sense is.  Be safe, be sensible, be considerate, be aware.

Absolutely no pets and no glass.  Be your best, and bring your best.

Due to the nature of the venue, we ask that all ins-and-outs be kept to a
bare minimum.  While we will not prohibit you from leaving, nor will we
refuse to let you back in, we do ask that everyone please make your trips in
and out of the venue as minimal as possible.  Please come prepared to stay.

Earthdance Concept:

The Mission
Our mission is to promote peace by joining participants worldwide in a
synchronized Prayer for Peace and to support humanitarian causes through the
global language of music and dance.
The Goal
Our goal is to inspire participation from promoters, clubs, artists,
musicians and peace-lovers worldwide to dedicate one day to support
humanitarian efforts and help unite people from all nations in a day of
peaceful celebration and harmony.  This year we are expanding the circle to
include anyone interested in world peace, even if you can't make it to an
official event.
The Objective
Our objective is to create as many Earthdance events around the world as
possible.  From public stadium concerts to private living room gatherings,
there are no conditions on how big or small an event has to be.  The spirit
of Earthdance is participation on whatever level possible.
In the spirit of "Think Global, Act Local," each local promoter must donate
at least 50% of their profits to a local charity related to one of the
following categories:

	?	The Welfare of Children & Urban Youth
	?	Indigenous Peoples
	?	International Relief and Development;
	?	Environmental Sustainability & Protection
	?	Organizations that help Promote Peace

Each promoter also commits to include that charity in their event by giving
them space to display information, and time to speak at the event.

The Trance Psyndicate is in the process of selecting the best possible
charity for this event.  If you have any ideas you would like to share, or
if you represent a charitable organization, please contact us.  We are
committed to the Earthdance concept and will do anything we can to give back
to the community.
Stay tuned to our website, http://www.trancepsyndicate.com for developing
updates.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Give me a couple days and I'll have that collabs set up in a semi proper 
form.  I'll run it thru some analog gear that has no businesses being in my 
possession and clean it up a bit.  When I post it it will be for 1 day only.

no, I want the scripts to the movies, then don't have to worry about  
actors throwing in their own little "enhancements" to make it sound  
better to them.

O wait, we already have the people the complain when movie is made  
from a book that the book is better.

Yeah, but the script is edited so much that it's really worthless.
You should buy the scripts before production closes, so you have the
true-to-form original.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

make the vibe, not the venue. So I urge you, once again and feel the 
vibe. No drama, no hate, just old fashioned good vibes.

Sep 15-17                      Earthdance 2006                  Central Il.

September 15, 16, 17 2006
Central Illinois, U.S.A.

E*A*R*T*H*D*A*N*C*E**2*0*0*6

We?ve come a long way and have found the reason we are who we are, and the
reason we do what we do. We have found many long-lost friends, and have made
so many new ones along the way.  Words can never describe the journey and
the journey will never be forgotten.  In commemoration of Earthdance 2006,
we have created just the right place, the right sounds, the right imagery,
and the right cause.  In beautiful rural Illinois, from Friday September
15th until Sunday September 17th the Trance Psyndicate invites YOU to be a
part of who we are, and to come see us inside.


A E S  D A N A   // LIVE - Lyons, France
Exclusive 3 hour Sunrise Set

Vincent Villuis, composer, deejay and Ultimae co-owner. His current project
::  Aes Dana :: stands as a coherent fusion of deep sounds rooted in the
atmospheric and psychedelic tradition, and a fluid down tempo morning
trance. Evocative sound textures, opening as a travelling over his
analogical dreams.  Short tales made of samples and waves, energised by
tribal beats. After the success of his latest album [ Memory Shell ], Aes
Dana continues to treat natural elements and weave kaleidoscopic sounds with
groovey and spacey backgrounds. He currently works on a musical score for 4
DVDs of NASA space imagery.


Yann - Tech Safari - Montreal, Quebec



Formerly known as DJ Dew, Yann was introduced to the underground electronic
scene in the early  90?s. These events were an eye opening experience and
filled him with a new musical sense. 1996 was a turning point for Yann, as
he started spinning and organizing parties with E.O.M.F. and subsequently
founded Cosmogony Concept.

At this point, the promoter has evolved into one of the most respected DJs
in Eastern Canada and is an active member of Techsafari Productions (Eclipse
International Festival). Today, Yann has a performance history that boasts
of over 200 major events throughout Canada. Additionally, he has been
resident at the Outer Limits monthly events at the legendary club
Playground, as well as at Yantra events (Interchill Records) and is
currently resident at the celebrated Amazone monthly events at the Society
for Art and Technology. On an international level, he has also been
contracted for events in Canada, the United States and in Morocco (Rythym of
Peace, Music of the Spheres, Full Moon, Club Darlah, Club Theatre O) and is
the North American representative for the German label Headroom Productions.
He is currently working on a compilation, Beta Sense, for the label, which
will be out in 2006.

Yann can read any crowd and each set he?s performed has provided him with
the opportunity to play alongside world-renowned talent such as X-Dream,
Hallucinogen, Astral Projection, Tim Shuldt, Absolum, Infected Mushroom,
Midmiliz, Dino Psaras, Son Kite, Deedrah, Ticon, Talamasca and many others.
His engaging unique sound blends groovy psychedelic trance with original,
percussive, banging beats and an impeccable mixing style.



Mahiane - Ultimae.Com - Lyons, France



Mahiane aka Sunny, co-owner and manager of Ultimae. Deejay and composer, she
participates to Aes Dana and occasionally H.U.V.A. Network. She recently
released [ Oxycanta ], a mix embodying the works of pioneers in the
exploration of a new style of electro-atmospheric ambient.


Gift Culture // LIVE - Dallas, Texas



The Gift Culture project is based on sounds, imagery, and art derived from
DSP technology, analogue synthesis, and computer-based non-linear editing.
As Gift Culture mastermind Michael Hale explains,

In this day and age, it is possible to sculpt light and sound as if they
were clay. Throw a midi-digitizer, sensors, and a video-sampler into the mix
and suddenly, you have the power to create fully immersive audio/visual
multimedia environments.

Gift Culture is the result - his attempts to share his explorations in this
multi-dimensional space; to evoke sonic textures from samplers,
synthesizers, and DSP algorithms that can only come from those things; a
journey to discover their "voices", so to speak, using such techniques as
granular synthesis, spectral resynthesis, FFT/IFFT based spectral morphing
and interpolation, and whatever other exotic algorithms he can coax out of
his myriad machines.


Psymbolic // LIVE - Chicago, Illinois



This catalytic duo (Julee & Troy) create Live Interactive Visual
Environments. Since 1999, they have become large-scale A/V event curators
and they continue to push their means of expression through their video
compositions and the realtime surrounding spectacles. Always providing a
customized thematic projection/performance of synchronous moments of meaning
and inspiration.



Cafrine  // LIVE - Tech Safari - Montreal, Quebec


Cafrine has been producing and mixing live video since 2001 and has been an
active member of the electronic music scene since 1998.

She first entered the field as a promoter for Felix the Katz, an underground
production company that threw a various number of events, from intimate
chill parties to larger ones, ranging from 100 to 1000 attendants and
focusing on audio-visual interactions. As a student of film and
communications, Cafrine was determined to marry her knowledge in video
production to these events.

Her goal as a VJ was to bring an imaged-based dimension to the music she
loved. She now creates and manipulates visual elements to live settings
using a variety of techniques, working simultaneously with several video
sources. Following her interest for new concepts, she has also worked in
with a variety of artists, such as DJs, musicians, painters, singers,
dancers and circus performers in order to create and even broader
interactive experience.

Cafrine has now performed at over 100 events for up to 10 000 participants
and developed a passion for a mix of colorful, organic, urban and dreamy
images. Now resident VJ for Techsafari?s legendary monthly Amazone nights at
the Society for Art and Technology, she has been working for three years
with the collective and has presented her creations in Montreal and on an
international level.


Alberto - Cosmic Traveler - Milano, Italy

Alberto has unique style, flawless performance skills, he is true
connoisseur of emotional driving tribal music. talented and methodical, he
creates intelligent soundscapes alternating melodic intensity and
compositional depth. Dance floor mayhem is guaranteed! Creative visual
artist and well known organizer, driving force behind Cosmic Traveler.  He
rocked our last full scale party, Cosmic Outset to no end and we are
extremely pleased to bring him back to invoke the madness all over again.


Dan Efex [D.N.X.] - Chicago, Illinois



dan efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out of
even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed shoulder
to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an energetic and
intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who consider him to
be one of the founders of the Midwest?s trance scene, a scene that is still
strong and growing today. He was one of the first to introduce the Midwest
to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions characteristic of some of
his styles of trance. But although Dan is perhaps best known for his trance,
do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as he is skilled! His repertoire of
past events includes sets with progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard
techno, hard core, hard house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it
up and keeps it interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and
know precisely what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind
on his musical excursions.


Professor X - Trance Psyndicate - Yuma, Arizona



The Professor is the leading authority on genetics, mutation, and psyonic
powers with considerable expertise in other life sciences.  He possesses a
strange, twisted fixation for inducing mental illusion.   As an integral
part of the Trance Psyndicate and its origin, we welcome him back to the
Midwest for digitally corrupted full-on madness.  :-)

Scotty Rotten - Trance Psyndicate - Miami, Florida



Did someone say Rotten?  One of the Trance Psyndicate?s long lost mentors
comes back to the Midwest for the first time in nearly 5 years.  Starting in
the Windy City, Scotty has been involved in the EDM culture since the early
nineties.  Working with several production crews in the Midwest, including
one of his own, he has played alongside some of the biggest names in the
United States Trance scene.  Hard. Trance. Redefined.  We?re glad to have
one of our main members BACK IN THE MIDWEST for this rare first-time
performance with his home crew.

Earthdance Concept:

The Mission
Our mission is to promote peace by joining participants worldwide in a
synchronized Prayer for Peace and to support humanitarian causes through the
global language of music and dance.
The Goal
Our goal is to inspire participation from promoters, clubs, artists,
musicians and peace-lovers worldwide to dedicate one day to support
humanitarian efforts and help unite people from all nations in a day of
peaceful celebration and harmony.  This year we are expanding the circle to
include anyone interested in world peace, even if you can't make it to an
official event.
The Objective
Our objective is to create as many Earthdance events around the world as
possible.  From public stadium concerts to private living room gatherings,
there are no conditions on how big or small an event has to be.  The spirit
of Earthdance is participation on whatever level possible.
In the spirit of "Think Global, Act Local," each local promoter must donate
at least 50% of their profits to a local charity related to one of the
following categories:

	?	The Welfare of Children & Urban Youth
	?	Indigenous Peoples
	?	International Relief and Development;
	?	Environmental Sustainability & Protection
	?	Organizations that help Promote Peace

Each promoter also commits to include that charity in their event by giving
them space to display information, and time to speak at the event.

The Trance Psyndicate is in the process of selecting the best possible
charity for this event.  If you have any ideas you would like to share, or
if you represent a charitable organization, please contact us.  We are
committed to the Earthdance concept and will do anything we can to give back
to the community.
Stay tuned to our website, http://www.trancepsyndicate.com for developing

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

It's that time of the year again kids! That's right, Gothcoming 2006 is 
just around the corner (Friday, September 22, 2006). Time to dust of 
that tux, dry clean the crinoline and start getting ready for the 
biggest Goth Industrial event of the year!

This year's theme is "Tales from DeCrypt", so you have a lot of 
latitude. It's Gothcoming, so school themes are always in. It's a play 
on words, so you can be Ghetto Goth Fabulous, Undead, or even a Math 
Teacher. Hell, why not do all three?

Once again Outland plays host to our party, and we get to celebrate it's 
first official year at the new location. If you haven't been there yet, 
you really need to check it out!

This is YOUR party so you need to make it the most fun that you can. 
Once again, we have Voltaire performing, and he will once again, be 
crowning this years King and Queen. We'll also be giving away a ton of 
cool prizes, so make sure your mark your calendars.

200 riot police break up illegal rave

 One officer suffers severed finger, eight more injured
 Patrol car set on fire as CS gas used to disperse 1,000

Paul Lewis
Monday August 28, 2006
The Guardian


Two hundred riot police from five counties used CS gas, dogs and batons to
disperse 1,000 ravers at an illegal party in Essex on Saturday night.
Riots broke out in a corn field next to the village of Ickleton, near
Saffron Walden, as partygoers clashed with police in scenes reminiscent of
the zenith of the free party movement in the late 1980s.
The violence, which flared up sporadically until early yesterday, was
sparked when a small delegation of officers tried to negotiate the
break-up of the party but met "unprecedented and ferocious" resistance,
police said. A police car was set on fire and nine officers were wounded
during the clashes, with injuries to police including a suspected broken
collarbone and a severed finger. At least two revellers were also injured.

Police blockaded the M11, a string of patrol cars lining a half-mile
stretch of the road, and officers later enforced a 40mph speed restriction
after ravers tried to cross the motorway to get into the heavily guarded
fields where the party took place.
A minority of revellers attacked officers, hurling broken bottles,
scaffolding bars and other missiles, police said.

Partygoers allege that officers used unnecessary force to close down the
party. One of the organisers described the police's approach as a "proper
fascist act of complete inhumanity".

By 6am officers had arrested 35 people on suspicion of causing a public
nuisance and seized vehicles, generators, a sound system and a small
quantity of drugs. Six hours later, as officers began to clear debris from
the site of the previous night's battles, a hardcore group of between 50
and 100 people refused to leave the field in protest at the tactics used
by police.

"It was terrifying," said Katherine, 21, from Norfolk, who left earlier in
the morning. "Suddenly we were surrounded by policemen in full riot gear
with shields and batons. They just came tearing through the field,
battering people and even using pepper spray. Several of my friends
suffered head injuries when they were hit and some were trampled underfoot
as the police advanced.

"All we want is to have a good time. The authorities may have won this one
but there will be other [parties] this summer."

Another raver, Billy, 29, from Suffolk, said: "There were hundreds of riot
police surrounding a sound system, which isn't normal at an event like
this, and a police Land Rover was being smashed up. The riot police were
everywhere, surrounding the whole field. There were still people dancing.
Then a helicopter came over and through a loud-hailer told us to leave the
area right away. Police charged everyone; it was heavy-handed."

The party is understood to have started on Friday night and comprised a
large dome, several tents and four separate music stages powered by a
generator.

"I heard music on Friday but I thought it was coming from somewhere else,"
said Robert Fairhead, 69, the farmer who owns the field used for the rave.
"I never expected to see anything like this in my lifetime here."

At about 7pm on Saturday, after Mr Fairhead contacted police, officers
blocked the entrance to his fields and some tried to negotiate with the
organisers.

"We went there with the intention of negotiating the implementation of the
Criminal Justice and Public Order Act," said Chief Superintendent Graeme
Bull, from Essex police. "We wanted to maintain the peace and ask people
to disperse. The majority of people were compliant and prepared to leave,
but there was a significant minority who met police with unprecedented and
ferocious resistance. Their conduct was disgraceful - weapons were used,
missiles were thrown."

As tension increased, riot police were hastily drafted in from
Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Suffolk and Norfolk to contain the rave, he
said. "These sorts of raves are quite unheard of in this county - I have
not seen this sort of violence since the old days of acid house."

He added that the level of aggression was "so intense" that police were
investigating the possibility that there was an organisation behind the
violence. But complaints about police brutality would be taken seriously,
he said.

Police also sealed off a farm near Heston, Cornwall, yesterday after
receiving information that the site was to be used for a rave.

In Gloucestershire, two officers were injured and several people were
arrested when police broke up an illegal party at a business park early on
Saturday.

well, at least these people didn't give up without a fight.  Tossing
their "missiles" at police and all.  Noticed how they mentioned a total
of nine officers were injured, but how many kids were?? must have
overlooked that little bit of information.  I'd say they should call
their next party "unprecedented and ferocious" :) .  I think it was
unprecedented because they've broken up enough raves to know that kids
will just go "oh.. that sucks.. I'm going to go rant on myspace (or
whatever the UK equivelent is)" and leave.  For once they weren't going
to go so easily.

Although, admittedly, the severed finger is a little too far.. a nice
touch, but too far.  Just leave it to tossing some missiles at them.

Sounds like it was a bunch of junglists.

We all know tranceheads wouldn't put up "unprecedented and ferocious"
resistance, other than needing to be carried out of the party, probably
while trying to suck the cops' "nightstick".

Sorry Trout, not coming to see your ass spin. So far as I know this is
the only Hype appearance this side of the big pond this year... I
wanna see him bad. Anyhow the event capacity is 6000, and I expect it

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sun Sep 03                    CHARLES FEELGOOD                   Pittsburgh

Charles Feelgood
www.charlesfeelgood.com | Fever

Legendary for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the 
Baltimore/Washington D.C. area, Charles Feelgood has built a reputation 
as a DJ in the international dance community through his ingenious remix 
skills and a dynamic brand of funky disco house.

In 1992 he joined forces with fellow DJ Scott Henry to launch Fever, a 
club event that introduced the sounds of electronic music to his 
hometown. The first event of it's kind in that region, the night 
exploded in popularity almost immediately, attracting upwards of 25,000 
people. Featuring such top-notch, internationally renowned talent as 
Paul Van Dyk and Carl Cox, the biweekly event ran through May 2001. The 
consummated dance floor rocker, Feelgood sums up his musical mission in 
one sentence: "I just want to do what the name implies, to make people 
have a good time and go home with a great feeling."

GoodvibesEnt. Proudly presents:
GOODVIBES!
Sunday, Sept. 3rd 2006
8:00pm-2:00am
18 to enter
21 to win! [and by win I mean get uber intoxicated]

Ive been noticing a bit of bad feelings in the scene lately so we at 
goodvibes decided that its time for another go, another reminder that 
the vibe is still here, that it doesnt have to be found in a warehouse 
or under a bridge. It can still be found right here. Its the people that 
make the vibe, not the venue. So I urge you, once again and feel the 
vibe. No drama, no hate, just old fashioned good vibes.

Sep 15-16                        ART DAMAGE                      Cincinnati

Announcing the 2006 Art Damage, Inc. Fund-Fest

It's been a year of good deeds from Art Damage Inc... Hurricane relief: 
we paid tribute, and nearly a grand $$$, to New Orleans (the epicenter 
of the "noise" music of its heyday) now in its time of need with the 
Samadi Gras benefit in February. Fire relief: with the news of the 
conflagration at our compatriot's Nautical Almanac headquarters in 
Baltimore, we immediately released from the Art Damage radio archives 
the Nautical Almanac/Leslie Keffer broadcast of June '04... $200+ and 
counting has thus been raised towards the restoration of Tarantula Hill. 
It might be said that no good deed goes unpunished, what with the recent 
cancellation of the Art Damage radio show on WAIF? But there is a good 
chance that "the damage" will be returning to the beleaguered station, 
if not by name, then by format. Meanwhile, a variety of experimental 
noise/music shows has been
presented at a host of venues around town, along with a weekly Art 
Damage DJ night Tuesdays at Kaldis. With all of this activity, expenses 
have incurred & funds are low, so it's time for another A.D.inc benefit, 
now to the support of experimental noise/musics in the good old 'Nati. 
Funds raised shall go toward the continued promotion of events featuring 
local, national & international acts, reaching new audiences therewith 
at venues hitherto unutilized... Eden Park Pavillion? Union Terminal? A 
showboat tour down the Ohio River? To the making realizable of these 
possibilities, we thank in advance the many local, regional and national 
acts who will be entertaining with their noise, music, art, science, et 
cetera at this lively event....

Sep 15-17                      Earthdance 2006                  Central Il.

September 15, 16, 17 2006
Central Illinois, U.S.A.

E*A*R*T*H*D*A*N*C*E**2*0*0*6

We?ve come a long way and have found the reason we are who we are, and the
reason we do what we do. We have found many long-lost friends, and have made
so many new ones along the way.  Words can never describe the journey and
the journey will never be forgotten.  In commemoration of Earthdance 2006,
we have created just the right place, the right sounds, the right imagery,
and the right cause.  In beautiful rural Illinois, from Friday September
15th until Sunday September 17th the Trance Psyndicate invites YOU to be a
part of who we are, and to come see us inside.


A E S  D A N A   // LIVE - Lyons, France
Exclusive 3 hour Sunrise Set

Vincent Villuis, composer, deejay and Ultimae co-owner. His current project
::  Aes Dana :: stands as a coherent fusion of deep sounds rooted in the
atmospheric and psychedelic tradition, and a fluid down tempo morning
trance. Evocative sound textures, opening as a travelling over his
analogical dreams.  Short tales made of samples and waves, energised by
tribal beats. After the success of his latest album [ Memory Shell ], Aes
Dana continues to treat natural elements and weave kaleidoscopic sounds with
groovey and spacey backgrounds. He currently works on a musical score for 4
DVDs of NASA space imagery.


Yann - Tech Safari - Montreal, Quebec



Formerly known as DJ Dew, Yann was introduced to the underground electronic
scene in the early  90?s. These events were an eye opening experience and
filled him with a new musical sense. 1996 was a turning point for Yann, as
he started spinning and organizing parties with E.O.M.F. and subsequently
founded Cosmogony Concept.

At this point, the promoter has evolved into one of the most respected DJs
in Eastern Canada and is an active member of Techsafari Productions (Eclipse
International Festival). Today, Yann has a performance history that boasts
of over 200 major events throughout Canada. Additionally, he has been
resident at the Outer Limits monthly events at the legendary club
Playground, as well as at Yantra events (Interchill Records) and is
currently resident at the celebrated Amazone monthly events at the Society
for Art and Technology. On an international level, he has also been
contracted for events in Canada, the United States and in Morocco (Rythym of
Peace, Music of the Spheres, Full Moon, Club Darlah, Club Theatre O) and is
the North American representative for the German label Headroom Productions.
He is currently working on a compilation, Beta Sense, for the label, which
will be out in 2006.

Yann can read any crowd and each set he?s performed has provided him with
the opportunity to play alongside world-renowned talent such as X-Dream,
Hallucinogen, Astral Projection, Tim Shuldt, Absolum, Infected Mushroom,
Midmiliz, Dino Psaras, Son Kite, Deedrah, Ticon, Talamasca and many others.
His engaging unique sound blends groovy psychedelic trance with original,
percussive, banging beats and an impeccable mixing style.



Mahiane - Ultimae.Com - Lyons, France



Mahiane aka Sunny, co-owner and manager of Ultimae. Deejay and composer, she
participates to Aes Dana and occasionally H.U.V.A. Network. She recently
released [ Oxycanta ], a mix embodying the works of pioneers in the
exploration of a new style of electro-atmospheric ambient.


Gift Culture // LIVE - Dallas, Texas



The Gift Culture project is based on sounds, imagery, and art derived from
DSP technology, analogue synthesis, and computer-based non-linear editing.
As Gift Culture mastermind Michael Hale explains,

In this day and age, it is possible to sculpt light and sound as if they
were clay. Throw a midi-digitizer, sensors, and a video-sampler into the mix
and suddenly, you have the power to create fully immersive audio/visual
multimedia environments.

Gift Culture is the result - his attempts to share his explorations in this
multi-dimensional space; to evoke sonic textures from samplers,
synthesizers, and DSP algorithms that can only come from those things; a
journey to discover their "voices", so to speak, using such techniques as
granular synthesis, spectral resynthesis, FFT/IFFT based spectral morphing
and interpolation, and whatever other exotic algorithms he can coax out of
his myriad machines.


Psymbolic // LIVE - Chicago, Illinois



This catalytic duo (Julee & Troy) create Live Interactive Visual
Environments. Since 1999, they have become large-scale A/V event curators
and they continue to push their means of expression through their video
compositions and the realtime surrounding spectacles. Always providing a
customized thematic projection/performance of synchronous moments of meaning
and inspiration.



Cafrine  // LIVE - Tech Safari - Montreal, Quebec


Cafrine has been producing and mixing live video since 2001 and has been an
active member of the electronic music scene since 1998.

She first entered the field as a promoter for Felix the Katz, an underground
production company that threw a various number of events, from intimate
chill parties to larger ones, ranging from 100 to 1000 attendants and
focusing on audio-visual interactions. As a student of film and
communications, Cafrine was determined to marry her knowledge in video
production to these events.

Her goal as a VJ was to bring an imaged-based dimension to the music she
loved. She now creates and manipulates visual elements to live settings
using a variety of techniques, working simultaneously with several video
sources. Following her interest for new concepts, she has also worked in
with a variety of artists, such as DJs, musicians, painters, singers,
dancers and circus performers in order to create and even broader
interactive experience.

Cafrine has now performed at over 100 events for up to 10 000 participants
and developed a passion for a mix of colorful, organic, urban and dreamy
images. Now resident VJ for Techsafari?s legendary monthly Amazone nights at
the Society for Art and Technology, she has been working for three years
with the collective and has presented her creations in Montreal and on an
international level.


Alberto - Cosmic Traveler - Milano, Italy

Alberto has unique style, flawless performance skills, he is true
connoisseur of emotional driving tribal music. talented and methodical, he
creates intelligent soundscapes alternating melodic intensity and
compositional depth. Dance floor mayhem is guaranteed! Creative visual
artist and well known organizer, driving force behind Cosmic Traveler.  He
rocked our last full scale party, Cosmic Outset to no end and we are
extremely pleased to bring him back to invoke the madness all over again.


Dan Efex [D.N.X.] - Chicago, Illinois



dan efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out of
even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed shoulder
to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an energetic and
intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who consider him to
be one of the founders of the Midwest?s trance scene, a scene that is still
strong and growing today. He was one of the first to introduce the Midwest
to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions characteristic of some of
his styles of trance. But although Dan is perhaps best known for his trance,
do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as he is skilled! His repertoire of
past events includes sets with progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard
techno, hard core, hard house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it
up and keeps it interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and
know precisely what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind
on his musical excursions.


Professor X - Trance Psyndicate - Yuma, Arizona



The Professor is the leading authority on genetics, mutation, and psyonic
powers with considerable expertise in other life sciences.  He possesses a
strange, twisted fixation for inducing mental illusion.   As an integral
part of the Trance Psyndicate and its origin, we welcome him back to the
Midwest for digitally corrupted full-on madness.  :-)

Scotty Rotten - Trance Psyndicate - Miami, Florida



Did someone say Rotten?  One of the Trance Psyndicate?s long lost mentors
comes back to the Midwest for the first time in nearly 5 years.  Starting in
the Windy City, Scotty has been involved in the EDM culture since the early
nineties.  Working with several production crews in the Midwest, including
one of his own, he has played alongside some of the biggest names in the
United States Trance scene.  Hard. Trance. Redefined.  We?re glad to have
one of our main members BACK IN THE MIDWEST for this rare first-time
performance with his home crew.

Earthdance Concept:

The Mission
Our mission is to promote peace by joining participants worldwide in a
synchronized Prayer for Peace and to support humanitarian causes through the
global language of music and dance.
The Goal
Our goal is to inspire participation from promoters, clubs, artists,
musicians and peace-lovers worldwide to dedicate one day to support
humanitarian efforts and help unite people from all nations in a day of
peaceful celebration and harmony.  This year we are expanding the circle to
include anyone interested in world peace, even if you can't make it to an
official event.
The Objective
Our objective is to create as many Earthdance events around the world as
possible.  From public stadium concerts to private living room gatherings,
there are no conditions on how big or small an event has to be.  The spirit
of Earthdance is participation on whatever level possible.
In the spirit of "Think Global, Act Local," each local promoter must donate
at least 50% of their profits to a local charity related to one of the
following categories:

	?	The Welfare of Children & Urban Youth
	?	Indigenous Peoples
	?	International Relief and Development;
	?	Environmental Sustainability & Protection
	?	Organizations that help Promote Peace

Each promoter also commits to include that charity in their event by giving
them space to display information, and time to speak at the event.

The Trance Psyndicate is in the process of selecting the best possible
charity for this event.  If you have any ideas you would like to share, or
if you represent a charitable organization, please contact us.  We are
committed to the Earthdance concept and will do anything we can to give back
to the community.
Stay tuned to our website, http://www.trancepsyndicate.com for developing
updates.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

It's that time of the year again kids! That's right, Gothcoming 2006 is 
just around the corner (Friday, September 22, 2006). Time to dust of 
that tux, dry clean the crinoline and start getting ready for the 
biggest Goth Industrial event of the year!

This year's theme is "Tales from DeCrypt", so you have a lot of 
latitude. It's Gothcoming, so school themes are always in. It's a play 
on words, so you can be Ghetto Goth Fabulous, Undead, or even a Math 
Teacher. Hell, why not do all three?

Once again Outland plays host to our party, and we get to celebrate it's 
first official year at the new location. If you haven't been there yet, 
you really need to check it out!

This is YOUR party so you need to make it the most fun that you can. 
Once again, we have Voltaire performing, and he will once again, be 
crowning this years King and Queen. We'll also be giving away a ton of 
cool prizes, so make sure your mark your calendars.

Subject: {pb-cle} escape from planet monday by dj fresh - u.s. release :)





been waiting for this one to drop here :)

out 9/5  :)

System Recordings and HUMAN Imprint are proud to present 'Escape From
Planet
Monday' - the first full length artist album from UK drum and bass producer
extraordinaire, DJ Fresh. Featuring DJ Shadow, Apollo 440, Pet Shop Boys
and
the massive drum 'n' bass anthem "All That Jazz VIP", 'Escape From Planet
Monday' delivers everything you would expect from the man behind Bad

'Escape From Planet Monday' is a rollercoaster ride through all of the
facets of DJ Fresh's imagination. DJ Fresh links Apollo 440 for "Nervous"
and the Pet Shop Boys for "Throw". He experiments with DJ Shadow for
"Closer" and brings in d'n'b sensations Pendulum for "Babylon Rising."
Couple that with all new mixes of club favorites "Submarines", "All That
Jazz" and "All Strung Out" and an album with many dimensions starts to
shape
up.

>From Planet Monday'!
