             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

HIGH TECH SOUL is the first documentary to tackle the deep roots of 
techno music alongside the cultural history of Detroit, its birthplace. 
>From the race riots of 1967 to the underground party scene of the late 
1980s, Detroit's economic downturn didn't stop the invention of a new 
kind of music that brought international attention to its producers and 
their hometown.

Featuring in-depth interviews with many of the world's best exponents of 
the artform, High Tech Soul focuses on the creators of the genre -- Juan 
Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson -- and looks at the 
relationships and personal struggles behind the music. Artists like 
Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Eddie Fowlkes and a host of 
others explain why techno, with its abrasive tones and resonating 
basslines, could not have come from anywhere but Detroit.

With classic anthems such as Rhythim Is Rhythim's "Strings of Life" and 
Inner City's "Good Life," High Tech Soul celebrates the pioneers, the 
promoters and the city that spawned a global phenomenon.

The film features: Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Eddie 
(Flashin) Fowlkes, Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, John Acquaviva, Carl Cox, 
Carl Craig, Blake Baxter, Stacey Pullen, Thomas Barnett, Matthew Dear, 
Anthony "Shake" Shakir, Keith Tucker, Delano Smith, Mike Archer, Derrick 
Thompson, Mike Clark, Alan Oldham, Laura Gavoor, Himawari, Scan 7, Kenny 
Larkin, Stacey "Hotwax" Hale, Claus Bachor, Electrifying Mojo, Niko 
Marks, Barbara Deyo, Dan Sordyl, Sam Valenti, Ron Murphy, George Baker, 
and Kwame Kilpatrick.

The film's soundtrack includes: Aux 88, Cybotron, Inner City, Juan 
Atkins, Mayday, Model 500, Plastikman, Rhythim Is Rhythim, and more. 


"Bredow's cast of alumni -- the holy trinity of Atkins, May & Saunderson 
at the front -- fill out this tale with passion, pride and, oddly for 
music of the future, nostalgia too."
- Dazed and Confused
 

"An enjoyable education into the music, the city and the main players 
past, present and future."
-DJ Magazine
 

"Defines the myths and the magic of Detroit techno from its beginnings 
right up to how it has evolved to become High Tech Soul."
-Derrick May
 

Location: Cleveland

Tek-know? will be hosting a screening of the movie High Tech Soul to be 
followed by another night of Tek-Know madness.


They will also have Gary Bredow, the film's writer, director, and 
producer, in for a Q & A session after the screening.<br>

Alan Oldham (T-1000)

One of Detroit's most talented and venerated techno mixers, DJ T-1000 
has been instrumental in the Motor City scene as a label-head and 
producer as well as DJ. Born Alan Oldham, he spent time as a 
graphic-design specialist and comics illustrator while studying media at 
Detroit's Wayne State University. Hired by Derrick May to illustrate the 
sleeves on a few Transmat releases, Oldham became interested in 
Detroit's electronic scene, and gradually transformed his Fast Forward 
radio program on WDET from industrial and fusion into techno. During the 
show's run, from 1987 to 1992, Oldham introduced thousands of area 
listeners to Detroit techno via productions from May, Kevin Saunderson, 
Juan Atkins, Underground Resistance, and Carl Craig . as well as other 
techno figures like Joey Beltram, Moby, 808 State, and LFO. The show 
ended in 1992 when an offer to tour with Underground Resistance as the 
replacement DJ for Jeff Mills proved too difficult to resist. Also in 
1992, he formed his own Generator label, the origin of seminal releases 
by Oldham projects like X-313 ("Interferon," "World Sonik Domination") 
and TXC-1 as well as tracks by Dave Clarke and Woody McBride. In 1996, 
Oldham closed Generator and opened a new label, Pure Sonik. He also 
began DJing around the world, gaining a reputation as one of the best 
Detroit DJs among considerable competition. The DJ T-1000 mix albums 
Supercollider (a Generator label retrospective) and Live Sabotage: Live 
in Belgium displayed his mixing genius, while his debut production 
full-length, Progress, appeared on Tresor in 1999. Oldham also began 
recording another album, for Astralwerks. In addition, he has recorded 
for Djax-Up-Beats, Matrix, and Communique, and done remix work for Terry 
Lee Brown, Jr. and the Punisher.

With an intent of building the positivity in the electronic music
scene in the midwest and Bowling Green, Electronic Enlightenment and
associates are hosting Jungle Love, a celebration of good music and
good vibes. Jungle Love is loosely a Valentine's Day-themed event, and
it will host two stages with 20 DJs, contrasting "rave" and "jungle"

Recordings:
The entire night will be photographed (by Sarah Asti of GSP) and
recorded on camera (by Jerrod Mercer and company), so be sure to act
and look your best for the cameras! In addition, both stages will be
recorded and the recordings will be available online for download
after the party.

Nourishment:
There will be reasonably priced snacks and drinks for sale for your
enjoyment. There also will be very light refreshments available for
free, as well as a drinking fountain for hydration. WBGU, Total Street
Knowledge, and other organizations/businesses will have booths setup
selling merchandise and spreading knowledge of what they do.

Benefit:
This event is a benefit for both WBGU (WBGUfm.com) and UCF. Though
there is no door charge, we encourage you to bring a few dollars to
donate to the cause of an underground college radio station and a
haven for positivity. Both of these organizations are underfunded and
struggle to survive to provide their unique and rare services to the
community.

Venue:

UCF:
The event will take place at UCF, a "Community and Spiritual
Development Center". UCF is a "shelter" that has an amazing aura of
respect and understanding. There is a lounge upstairs, a roomier
basement downstairs, and a tiny chill room for quiet and relaxation.
There are bathrooms and a drinking fountain inside the venue with easy
access. There will be areas provided outside specifically for smoking.

Sat Mar 24                        FUSION 2                          Detroit

Saturday, March 24th, 2007
D.P.S. (DETROIT PARANORMAL SOCIETY) also known as..... Local 313 presents....

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

HIGH TECH SOUL: THE CREATION OF TECHNO MUSIC
Director:Gary Bredow.
High Tech soul: The Creation of Techno, is a documentary film that traces
the conception of Techno music. This film digs deep into the roots of Techn=
o
as well as the culture of a city, answering questions of how and why this
music came from Detroit. Featuring Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin
Saunderson, Eddie Fowlkes, Richie Hawtin, and many of the other innovators
that continue to take the music to new levels today. High tech Soul also
explores the relationships and personal struggles of the individuals who
created this global phenomenon. From the riots of 1967 to the underground
party scene of the late 80's, the film invites you to take a walk around th=
e
globe and back to one of the richest and most challenging cities in the
world. The artists explain why Techno with it's driving beats, abrasive
tones, and resonating bass lines could not have come from anywhere else
other than Detroit. Techno is much like the city itself, deprived and
emotional yet continuing to set trends around the world, touching lives no
one could have ever imagined.
We will also have Gary Bredow, the film's writer, director, and producer, i=
n
for a Q & A session after the screening.

Alan Oldham (T-1000)
One of Detroit's most talented and venerated techno mixers, DJ T-1000 has
been instrumental in the Motor City scene as a label-head and producer as
well as DJ. Born Alan Oldham, he spent time as a graphic-design specialist
and comics illustrator while studying media at Detroit's Wayne State
University. Hired by Derrick May to illustrate the sleeves on a few Transma=
t
releases, Oldham became interested in Detroit's electronic scene, and
gradually transformed his Fast Forward radio program on WDET from industria=
l
and fusion into techno. During the show's run, from 1987 to 1992, Oldham
introduced thousands of area listeners to Detroit techno via productions
from May, Kevin Saunderson, Juan Atkins, Underground Resistance, and Carl
Craig =97 as well as other techno figures like Joey Beltram, Moby, 808 Stat=
e,
and LFO. The show ended in 1992 when an offer to tour with Underground
Resistance as the replacement DJ for Jeff Mills proved too difficult to
resist. Also in 1992, he formed his own Generator label, the origin of
seminal releases by Oldham projects like X-313 ("Interferon," "World Sonik
Domination") and TXC-1 as well as tracks by Dave Clarke and Woody McBride.
In 1996, Oldham closed Generator and opened a new label, Pure Sonik. He als=
o
began DJing around the world, gaining a reputation as one of the best
Detroit DJs among considerable competition. The DJ T-1000 mix albums
Supercollider (a Generator label retrospective) and Live Sabotage: Live in
Belgium displayed his mixing genius, while his debut production full-length=
,
Progress, appeared on Tresor in 1999. Oldham also began recording another
album, for Astralwerks. In addition, he has recorded for Djax-Up-Beats,
Matrix, and Communique, and done remix work for Terry Lee Brown, Jr. and th=
e
Punisher.

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Oddly enough, I expect that because I see high school kids in jean  
jackets with metallica patches sewn to them that rave is just  
sleeping and will be back perhaps 5 years after these kids are done  
with this fad.

Then, we'll all be the old guy at the back of the club.

All bitching because we did it better, harder and more authentic.

Subject: {pb-cle} Steve Porter at Palm Photos

Wow, this club gets more fun every week.  It's a great group of 
people, most of whom are "grown-up ravers", old school people who 
don't go to parties anymore because they're twice as old as the 
little annoying kids that can be found there nowadays.

Anyway, Steve Porter tore the place up and the more real techno i 
hear in there, the more I fall in love with the place.

Here's my shots from last night, Enjoy!

Alan... you were one of the coolest random ppl I met in the 'rave' scene... not to mention the first gay dude friend I had haha..

'rave' has been dead since 2002-2003... yep.  And this is just a formality....

...in my HUMBLE opinion.

I miss those days.  For as much shit as that time put me thru and how long it took me to mentally recover... I shouldnt miss them as much as I do.  I would never trade them, though.

I gotta check out is11.net... 11 is my hockey number... thatd be a sweet email address... CNichols@is11.net...

my luck itll be a gay site haha.  

Later Alan, hope youre doing well.

Peace Pb-Cle

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

HIGH TECH SOUL is the first documentary to tackle the deep roots of 
techno music alongside the cultural history of Detroit, its birthplace. 
>From the race riots of 1967 to the underground party scene of the late 
1980s, Detroit's economic downturn didn't stop the invention of a new 
kind of music that brought international attention to its producers and 
their hometown.

Featuring in-depth interviews with many of the world's best exponents of 
the artform, High Tech Soul focuses on the creators of the genre -- Juan 
Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson -- and looks at the 
relationships and personal struggles behind the music. Artists like 
Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Eddie Fowlkes and a host of 
others explain why techno, with its abrasive tones and resonating 
basslines, could not have come from anywhere but Detroit.

With classic anthems such as Rhythim Is Rhythim's "Strings of Life" and 
Inner City's "Good Life," High Tech Soul celebrates the pioneers, the 
promoters and the city that spawned a global phenomenon.

The film features: Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Eddie 
(Flashin) Fowlkes, Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, John Acquaviva, Carl Cox, 
Carl Craig, Blake Baxter, Stacey Pullen, Thomas Barnett, Matthew Dear, 
Anthony "Shake" Shakir, Keith Tucker, Delano Smith, Mike Archer, Derrick 
Thompson, Mike Clark, Alan Oldham, Laura Gavoor, Himawari, Scan 7, Kenny 
Larkin, Stacey "Hotwax" Hale, Claus Bachor, Electrifying Mojo, Niko 
Marks, Barbara Deyo, Dan Sordyl, Sam Valenti, Ron Murphy, George Baker, 
and Kwame Kilpatrick.

The film's soundtrack includes: Aux 88, Cybotron, Inner City, Juan 
Atkins, Mayday, Model 500, Plastikman, Rhythim Is Rhythim, and more. 


"Bredow's cast of alumni -- the holy trinity of Atkins, May & Saunderson 
at the front -- fill out this tale with passion, pride and, oddly for 
music of the future, nostalgia too."
- Dazed and Confused
 

"An enjoyable education into the music, the city and the main players 
past, present and future."
-DJ Magazine
 

"Defines the myths and the magic of Detroit techno from its beginnings 
right up to how it has evolved to become High Tech Soul."
-Derrick May
 

Location: Cleveland

Tek-know? will be hosting a screening of the movie High Tech Soul to be 
followed by another night of Tek-Know madness.


They will also have Gary Bredow, the film's writer, director, and 
producer, in for a Q & A session after the screening.<br>

Alan Oldham (T-1000)

One of Detroit's most talented and venerated techno mixers, DJ T-1000 
has been instrumental in the Motor City scene as a label-head and 
producer as well as DJ. Born Alan Oldham, he spent time as a 
graphic-design specialist and comics illustrator while studying media at 
Detroit's Wayne State University. Hired by Derrick May to illustrate the 
sleeves on a few Transmat releases, Oldham became interested in 
Detroit's electronic scene, and gradually transformed his Fast Forward 
radio program on WDET from industrial and fusion into techno. During the 
show's run, from 1987 to 1992, Oldham introduced thousands of area 
listeners to Detroit techno via productions from May, Kevin Saunderson, 
Juan Atkins, Underground Resistance, and Carl Craig . as well as other 
techno figures like Joey Beltram, Moby, 808 State, and LFO. The show 
ended in 1992 when an offer to tour with Underground Resistance as the 
replacement DJ for Jeff Mills proved too difficult to resist. Also in 
1992, he formed his own Generator label, the origin of seminal releases 
by Oldham projects like X-313 ("Interferon," "World Sonik Domination") 
and TXC-1 as well as tracks by Dave Clarke and Woody McBride. In 1996, 
Oldham closed Generator and opened a new label, Pure Sonik. He also 
began DJing around the world, gaining a reputation as one of the best 
Detroit DJs among considerable competition. The DJ T-1000 mix albums 
Supercollider (a Generator label retrospective) and Live Sabotage: Live 
in Belgium displayed his mixing genius, while his debut production 
full-length, Progress, appeared on Tresor in 1999. Oldham also began 
recording another album, for Astralwerks. In addition, he has recorded 
for Djax-Up-Beats, Matrix, and Communique, and done remix work for Terry 
Lee Brown, Jr. and the Punisher.

recorded and the recordings will be available online for download
after the party.

donate to the cause of an underground college radio station and a
haven for positivity. Both of these organizations are underfunded and
struggle to survive to provide their unique and rare services to the
community.

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS

Let the buyer beware.  I tried to buy $75 of stuff from him, and it
never arrived.  He said he got it packaged it at a UPS store, but then
mailed it from the post office (why not just mail from the UPS
store?).  Was not able to provide me any receipts or anything.  All I
got was "they're looking into it," followed by 2 months of silence and
then he got offended and stopped responding after a while when I said
to his friend that I wanted to meet him.  In all fairness, he did
offer to refund "part" of the money in the beginning, but then became
non-responsive about post office inquiries.

NOTE: This is my experience.  It may not be yours.  And if anyone on
here is friends with him please do not get insulted. I am just
relaying my experience, and cautioning others.  I had let this matter
go and forgotten about it.  But don't want anyone to experience the
same.  So, to be sure, I highly recommend getting a tracking number
for any and all internet purchases regardless of who it is from.

no drama - im just simply stating that those records were sent out. they 
arent here in my apartment. i know how shitty the situation is, and im 
friends with both parties. honestly - the entire ordeal shouldnt even be 
brought up here on the list. it should be between the two parties in 
private emails. =)

no drama at all. i just know those tunes were sent out. thats all..  <3

Possibly guilt from being attached to the Kevin Federline album?

No, I seriously don't mean any disrespect...he was a young guy with a

It's a shame no one caught it before it was too late.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Two stages: "Jungle" and "Rave"

Substance-free (No drugs, alcohol, or smoking)
No weapons, markers, or dangerous chemicals.
Also, no fighting, bad attitudes, bad vibes, negativity, sex,
nakedness, or malicious intent.
Also, in the spirit of a gag gift-filled Valentine's Day there will be

step-children.
---

With an intent of building the positivity in the electronic music
scene in the midwest and Bowling Green, Electronic Enlightenment and
associates are hosting Jungle Love, a celebration of good music and
good vibes. Jungle Love is loosely a Valentine's Day-themed event, and
it will host two stages with 20 DJs, contrasting "rave" and "jungle"
music. The event will simultaneously act as a promotional event for
WBGU 88.1 FM, the underground college radio station located nearby,
and UCF, the venue. Come help us have a good time and support good
causes.

Info:

Giveaways:
There will be giveaways throughout the night, including CDs and
glowsticks. Be sure to get there early to get them while they last.

Recordings:
The entire night will be photographed (by Sarah Asti of GSP) and
recorded on camera (by Jerrod Mercer and company), so be sure to act
and look your best for the cameras! In addition, both stages will be
recorded and the recordings will be available online for download
after the party.

Nourishment:
There will be reasonably priced snacks and drinks for sale for your
enjoyment. There also will be very light refreshments available for
free, as well as a drinking fountain for hydration. WBGU, Total Street
Knowledge, and other organizations/businesses will have booths setup
selling merchandise and spreading knowledge of what they do.

Benefit:
This event is a benefit for both WBGU (WBGUfm.com) and UCF. Though
there is no door charge, we encourage you to bring a few dollars to
donate to the cause of an underground college radio station and a
haven for positivity. Both of these organizations are underfunded and
struggle to survive to provide their unique and rare services to the
community.

---

Venue:

UCF:
The event will take place at UCF, a "Community and Spiritual
Development Center". UCF is a "shelter" that has an amazing aura of
respect and understanding. There is a lounge upstairs, a roomier
basement downstairs, and a tiny chill room for quiet and relaxation.
There are bathrooms and a drinking fountain inside the venue with easy
access. There will be areas provided outside specifically for smoking.

Parking:
There is no parking on any of the three surrounding streets (Pike,
Thurstin, or Ridge) but there is a large overflow parking lot (Lot E)
on the other side of Pike Street.

Address:
313 Thurstin Ave.
Bowling Green, OH 43402

Saturday, March 24th, 2007
D.P.S. (DETROIT PARANORMAL SOCIETY) also known as..... Local 313 presents....

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters

1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)

night every Sunday night, starting Dec. 4, at the Spy in Downtown 
Cleveland's Warehouse District. Explicit Productions (Old School, 
Columbus) has come out of hibernation and into Cleveland to produce a No 
Bullshit, scene supporting, killer club night at one of Clevelands best 
venues for a great sunday of bangin' beats.

We're bringing in some Fresh Blood with some hot new resident DJs. You 
might not have heard of them, but you Definitely need to hear them. 
Check out:
DJ Howse Mowse
DJ Jason Damman
DJ Spyral
Robert Van Helsing
These guys are talented, spin some great music, and are down with the 
program to bring together a killer club night without a fifteen dollar 
cover. Moonshine will have a $5.00 cover ($8.00 for ages 18-20). We will 
bring in guest DJs. We will bring in special acts. We will try our 
damndest to do it all without raising the cover charge.

Subject: {pb-cle} Finally going to WMC

Hey strangers.

I'm just wondering who else will be down there for a possible meetup. I 
don't think I'm going to get too deeply into the conference but I just 
want to hit a few afterparties and basically just be a beach bum for a week.

So... who am I going to see down there?

Subject: {pb-cle} Photographers going to WMC?

Hey guys -
Just checking in to see who is going to be heading
down to Miami for Conference. I'm looking for a couple
photogs that would be interested in documenting the
events for our online photo gallery. Photo credit
would of course be given, but I can't promise much
else at the moment. :(  I'm not going to be going this
year unfortunately. (Saving money for London trip this
summer.)

I'd say I could get you in on some lists, but Lindsey
and I couldn't even really swing that last year except
for the Contagious party.

But, if anyone is willing, please drop me an e-mail to
stephanie@basslinemagazine.com. I don't check this
account much.

Thanks in advance,
Stephanie/ BasslineMagazine.com
(now in the dirrty Dayton)

P.S. For all of you wondering, Issue 004 content from
the last print issue is VERY close to going live
online (finally, I know right?) and Issue 005 online
will be up after that. Start sending any feature/
spotlight/ product etc. etc. ideas to me too.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

D.P.S. (DETROIT PARANORMAL SOCIETY) also known as..... Local 313 presents....

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

Who all is going?
http://hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/event?event=07-02-24-candy.4.kids

I'm not sure what all the times lots are, but here's when the psytrance DJs
are playing in the second room:

Eryn Evans 2am-3am
Meghan 3am-4am
Orange Mantis 4am-5am
Cykadelic Co. 5am-6am

Here's where it's gonna be:

Delonzo's
1151 Oakdale Rd.
Wellsville, OH 43968

Saw this posted on lolli:

If you're driving from Pittsburgh or I guess places south of the venue,
Mapquest may get you lost on the last couple turns!

So, if you get mapquest directions the last couple turns should be:

Follow OH-45
turn right onto OH-45 (lisbon street) 1.1 mi
turn right onto Mick Road/ Twp Hwy 911
Then IMMEDIATELY turn left onto Esther Ave
Then left onto Oakdale Rd
Dalonzo's will be on the right. Look for signs the last couple miles marked
C4K!

Meghan:  Thanks for your response. 
All:  Since car-pooling is economical, I'm offering some seats in my 
Prelude.  If anybody needs a ride down from points around Cleveland, 
you're more than welcome to join me.

Subject: {pb-cle} Question for all you Canada-fuckers.

Do I need a passport to drive across the border or is that just for air 
travel right now?

I know that the land and sea phase is part of the Western Hemisphere 
Travel Initiative but I'm thinking it hasn't been implemented yet.

Who knows what?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Question for all you Canada-fuckers.

I dunno. When I went on my honeymoon up there in canadia I didn't  
even have to show ID going in. Come to think of it, I've never had to  
show ID going in during the dozens of times I've been there since I  
was 19 or so. The hassle has always been coming back in, which in  
June I was able to show photo ID and a birth certificate. My Dad  
crosses the northern and southern border quite a bit and swears by  
his passport.

I hate crossing the border, it's probably the one thing that keeps me  
from going to Canadia more often. Even though I've never had reason  
to worry, I always have these visions of someone blasting NWO by  
Ministry as I get beaten profusely with a bunch of tire testers by  
heavily armored border guards.

That is a great song to get your ass beat to though!

Right now, it's just air travel requires a passport.  Land and sea
travel (avaste ye, err.. something like that.. yarr) still doesn't need
a passport.  They say to bring two forms of id though (drivers license
and birth certificate would work).  If you have a passport, that's all
you need.  I believe the date that land and sea need a passport is "as
early as" 1-1-2008.  It hasn't been set in stone and keeps getting
pushed back because families are complaining about getting passports for
all their kids.  Although I thought I saw something saying that children
under some age won't require a passport.

We used to go to canadia all the time (still do, just not as often) and
I always hated going though US customs.  Canada customs was pretty much
how you explained it.  They welcome people into canada.  I may have been
asked ids once or twice, but I think they did it just to do things by
the book and didn't really care.  US customs on the other hand.  Damn.
You feel like you are getting interrogated to enter your own freakin
country.  Of the dozen or so times I've come across the border, maybe..
maybe once was it not stressful.  Every other time you feel like they
they think you're a terrorist or something when you are just there
because there's a much better hardcore scene in canada and canadian
chicks are hot.

Maybe one of these times they won't let us cross the border and we have
to stay in canada, darn.  Even though I know that could never happen.
They couldn't deny us entry back in to the country, but that doesn't
stop them from blasting NWO and beating us down once we're in the country.

taken from The Us Dept. of State

*Under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI)*

The proposed implementation timeline has two phases:

   - Beginning *January 23, 2007*, ALL persons, including U.S. citizens,
   traveling by *air* between the United States and Canada, Mexico,
   Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Bermuda will be required to
   present a valid passport, Air NEXUS card, or U.S. Coast Guard Merchant
   Mariner Document, or an Alien Registration Card, Form I-551, if applicable.
   - As early as *January 1, 2008*, ALL persons, including U.S. citizens,
   traveling between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico, Central and South
   America, the Caribbean, and Bermuda by *land* or *sea* (including
   ferries), may be required to present a valid passport or other documents as
   determined by the Department of Homeland Security. While recent legislative
   changes permit a later deadline, the Departments of State and Homeland
   Security are working to meet all requirements as soon as possible. Ample
   advance notice will be provided to enable the public to obtain passports or
   passport cards for land/sea entries.

Nope that's not until 2008.  You just need one if you are going to fly.

Hey all... it's been a while since i posted anything on pubicle... but i
figured some of you may be interested in this update.

If anybody is interested in contributing, feel free to contact me directly.

:D

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey there!

It has been a really, really long time since we've emailed you and we hope
you don't take this email as "spam" and you give it just a second to read
this latest update from The Selekta! (We haven't sent one in a couple of
years!)

We are emailing you because at one time or another in the last 10 years,
you've written to us or signed up for our mailing list. (Yes, we realize
that was a really long time ago!) We are writing to you now because we've
got some exciting news to share!

As you know, The Selekta (www.selekta.com) was launched online in 1998. In
that time, we've operated with the sole intention of bringing the best new
electronic music and culture information to the Web, and in this time,
we've been very lucky to have participation from all sides of the
electronic music industry. From 1998-2003, we were considered to be one of
the best sources for in-depth information about artists, events and new
music releases.

We admit it, we've slowed down over the last couple of years... but in
that time we've received thousands of emails from people asking us to
"step it up" and keep the information flowing, especially interviews,
articles, music and event reviews, artist and record label profiles... and
of course... our streaming audio database.

So... People have spoken up, and we've listened! It's taken a bit of time
to get things back in order, upgrade our databases and web technology and
implement some new features that will make the Web site easier to use and
long-lasting. The reality of it was that the Selekta.com Web site still
gets a lot of online traffic, and it would be a shame to not do something
to use that for the advantage of the overall community.

As many people have made the request that we "bring it back", we finally
decided to bite the bullet and make something happen.

That's where you come in! (Well, we hope anyway!)

We are looking for people who love music and culture and who want to make
their voices (and their music) heard by our international audience. We
have made the commitment to once again dedicate ourselves to exposing
great new music and relevant information about independent music to the
world audience. This time, however, we aren't going to be strictly focused
on electronic genres. While we have our roots in house, techno, drum n
bass, and breaks, we are now committing ourselves to cover music that's
just "good", regardless of genre or classification. "Why not?" (that's
what we said!)

You are getting this email because we are hoping you might be able to help
us! How can you help? It's Easy...

First off, you can tell your friends that we are back and that we are
going to work really hard in making The Selekta (www.selekta.com) better
than ever. In addition, there are a variety of other ways you can be more
directly involved with us:



Stream Your Audio
Are you a recording artist, DJ, producer, or record label? We originally
launched our streaming media archive in 1997 as a way to help promote
music that we thought should be heard by all. We are actively seeking

audio database, just fill our our contact form and let us know how you'd

distribution system that let's people add content to their own Web site by
including just a single line of code inside your Web Site pages. Drive
traffic to your Web site by including links to our articles on your pages
and be part of the crew without having to do much of anything other that

Selekta.com to spread the word about the best in underground music.

Selekta.com on your own Web site, just fill in our contact

Become a Sponsor!
We get traffic! And that traffic costs a lot of money to support
(especially the streaming audio!)

Selekta.com has been a part of the online music community for close to 10
years, and we don't plan on stopping any time soon! Are you looking for a
way to reach an audience of smart, interesting, and information-seeking
music fans, producers, record labels, artists, DJs, bands, and others with
a real taste for what's truly unique in the ever-changing music industry?
We can help! We offer a variety of sponsorship opportunities that can help
you get the word out, and a system in place that let's you monitor the
results of your ad-banner campaigns using a Web-based sponsorship
management tool.

our audience to you! Just contact us and let us know of your interest.

We are well aware that it's been a long time since you've heard from us,
and in the spirit of helping us to keep the information flowing, we hope
this email was well received. If you don't care to hear from us anymore,
please just unsubscribe from the mailing list. What we really hope,
however, is that you are happy to hear what we are up to and excited about
possibly helping us step things up and get back to our previous place as a
"goto" source for new music information. We promise to work hard at it for
you... and we do it because we are a bunch of people who really just love
music and want to help stimulate interest in the independent music
community.

We hope to hear from you!

In music,

The Selekta Crew

Subject: {pb-cle} TWT Afterparty... come celebrate Trout's Birthday!

TWT = Train Wreck Tuesdays.

It's held at Deja Vue lounge in the strip district in Pittsburgh.

Afterwards, everyone is invited to come to the Dan K's from 2am on on
tuesday night.

That's Tuesday the 27th, as in tomorrow.

We're gonna try and see exactly how fucked up we can get Trout.

Be SURE to buy your alcohol / whatever early and bring it with you. I
am dead broke and dont have a cent to buy any beer.

.REPEAT.

BRING YOUR OWN BEER/WHATEVER!

There is a slight chance that a few of us may start early without
Trout, that is if a friend of mine can't get into TWT, we'll head back
to my place and start around midnight?

You can follow people back from TWT or just message me for the
address... It's in the south side, a few doors down from Primanti
brothers. ( Message me before 9pm tomorrow)

Dan K

p.s. Trout: Didn't you know it was cool to hate? There can be no in if
there is no outside. (to quote the formerly great Peter Gabriel)

Cell phone companies are charging us $1.00 to $1.75 or more for 411 
information calls when they don't have to. Most of us do not carry a 
telephone directory in our vehicle, which makes this situation even 
more of a problem. 
When you need to use the 411 information option, simply dial 1 (800) 
FREE 411, or 1 (800) 373-3411 without incurring any charge at all! 
This is the kind of information people don't mind receiving, so pass it 
on to your family and friends. This works on your home telephone as
  well.

  and why would anyone report $150K of equipement to get $20K? I mean thats shady but if BT does like three shows he could buy it again..and doesn't he have backups of all his stuff in alot of places.. I wonder if this isn't just an attention scheme..opinions?

The way he's saying that, he's making it sound like that laptop has  
the only copy of that stuff.  I hope that's just for dramatic effect  
and not true.  Seriously, who would have their primary money making  
job on a laptop and not have backups anywhere?  My work machine is a  
laptop and it backs up every week more or less and all the really  
important code and stuff are stored in subversion on a separate  
server so if my laptop spontaneously combusts (no, it's not a dell)  
I'm not going to lose everything.

Been waiting for TrueCrypt to come out with a mac version.  Then I  
could have a usb drive with an encrypted storage area that works in  
windows, linux and mac.  Right now it's either create a truecrypt  
file that works in windows and linux or make an encrypted disk image  
on the mac.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} BT got robbed!

BT had his shit stolen quite awhile back, I believe while recording
R&R or 10 Years in the Life.  Including the shit that was stolen were
master tapes to the album he was working on, among other things.

Unless this is a second set of shit going awry, I don't think those
tapes are coming back.  :-/

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} BT got robbed!

I'm sure its difficult to do backups with his road schedule. Even if  
he DID have backups, wasn't this a studio robbery and wouldn't have  
mattered a whole lot (backups could have been jacked as well) I know  
that when I'm doing work in Live, I tend to generate a LOT of audio,  
and if I'm not home the Subversion backups to the home server would  
take a long time, even on a fast connection. I could burn a disk  
image off of a self contained Live set, but shit, it's going to sit  
with everything else I own. In BT's case, I doubt there'd be anyone  
he'd want to send his tour material to for a backup.

He's actually kind of lucky... the gear that guy owns that COULD have  
been jacked that's priceless is still intact. Although that Neuron is  
probably irreplaceable with his patches in it given the complexity of  
the damn thing.

When you get those little registration cards with gear, that's what  
you're supposed to mail in to have it recorded when this shit  
happens, but it really never does a whole lot of good.

If anything, I'd have tried to have as many items backed up as I  
could, like the Live sets, then just have torrented the entire thing  
to make it all worthless as anything more than hardware.

love for his toddler daughter.  i hate that this has happened to him again,
but especially time around.  mary =(

Maybe it is karma though.  I've heard some stories about him acting
like a total rockstar and smashing other people's gear that had to be
acquired per contract for his performances  and then just leaving
without any apologies...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} BT got robbed!

yeah, as a buddhist, it's definitely karma, even if from a past lifetime,
but it's still sad.  i heard he'd gone thru a "rock star" period but i
never heard about him breaking anybody's stuff?  in any case, he seems to
be out of his "rock star" phase ...

anyway, it crossed my mind that maybe the loss of stuff before, how
devastating something like that can be, might have contributed to the
beauty of This Binary Universe - it is incredibly beautiful to me, so much
depth of feeling - it reminded me of the story of green day getting an
album stolen then pulling out American Idiot.

i just feel bad for the guy.

spiritually he seems to be in a good place, though, from the
community-minded things he says at the end of the announcement ...
