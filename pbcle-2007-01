Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm

http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

I heard Saddam's got a new sitcom on the WB... sure to stir controversey, 
especially when pitted against the Gilmour Girls.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Well, all in all, I had a GREAT time at this event.  The highlight of the night was Rob Riddum's set downstairs which had the floor HOPPIN!  Bagel was also off the hook tearing out one old school classic after another. (Original WarHead etc.)  Good to see some familiar old faces...Pete, Kelly, Brendan, and nice to meet you Amanda!  Just wish there would have been a few more people...

Subject: {pb-cle} Kenya Dig It - Toronto NYE pics

http://parties.vrillusions.com/gallery/2006-12-31-kenyadigit

Always have a good time in Toronto.  Although paying for it now.  Always
lose my voice afterwards, but I don't really scream or anything.
Coworkers find it entertaining, though.  The venue was really packed and
there was no ventilation in there, to the point the walls and ceiling
were dripping from condensation.  It was also nice walking around
Toronto in a spring jacket.  I think it was warmer in Toronto than it is
in ohio (probably from lake effect).

Props to Dan, Adrian, and Brittany for letting us chill at their hotel
the next day.  Even away from their house their great hosts.  And the
hilton kicks ass compared to Days Inn (I guess the goes without
saying?).  Didn't have maids constantly knocking on the door, the
elevators actually worked, I think there was some sort of internet access.

How did you like Jimni Cricket, I've always known her as a Seattle local, kinda interested how she did as a headliner in Toronto on NYE. If I'm not mistaken this is one of the first times she has made it out of the pacific northwest.

Always have a good time in Toronto.  Although paying for it now.  Always
lose my voice afterwards, but I don't really scream or anything.
Coworkers find it entertaining, though.  The venue was really packed and
there was no ventilation in there, to the point the walls and ceiling
were dripping from condensation.  It was also nice walking around
Toronto in a spring jacket.  I think it was warmer in Toronto than it is
in ohio (probably from lake effect).

Props to Dan, Adrian, and Brittany for letting us chill at their hotel
the next day.  Even away from their house their great hosts.  And the
hilton kicks ass compared to Days Inn (I guess the goes without
saying?).  Didn't have maids constantly knocking on the door, the
elevators actually worked, I think there was some sort of internet access.

Subject: {pb-cle} D&B tagteams at a house party this sat

Any of you spin D&B and might be willing to tagteam at our house party
this saturady? The occasion is Rachel's Birthday and Daisy's Birthday.
So far we have:

Dr Rockso vs Ricki Skullcrusher.
RyuRy the Traveller vs ?

and a couple of maybes.

Anyhow if you just wanna come by and watch the mayhem, drop me a line
and I'll send the address. It's in the southside right off 19th
street, the party will be Saturday night, starting somewhere between
9-11pm.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Jan 19                        MO PRESHA                         Detroit

|| --Paxahau presents Mo' Presha-- || January 19th, 2007


Troy Pierce - M-nus
Raised in cornfields and brought up on the Midwest sound,
Troy moved to Berlin and started making a name for himself as
both a DJ and Producer 4 years ago. After extensive touring
with the M-nus crew both as part of the min2MAX tours and
opening slots for Mr. Hawtin he has the experience of the
world circuit under his belt. You don.t want to miss Troy.s
unique style of minimal goodness, mixed to perfection.

Marc Houle - M-nus
Undoubtedly fueled by the golden age of synthesizers,
Houle is captured by early 80.s synth pop and the underground-
turned-anthem classics of Acid House. There.s also no doubt that
the early years of minimal techno had their share of influence as
well (.Clock Width. is a subtle tribute to Dan Bell) inspiring his own
model of rhythm and resonance. Marc has been touring extensively
since his appearance at the Movement festival last year, fine-tuning
his live show as well as unleashing new gems onto the dance floor.
Quality techno, pristine soundscapes of rhythm, unabridged machine
grooves. Marc Houle represent.

Rich Korach - Paxahau
PaxaResident extraordinaire returns to let loose on the decks to warm
up the crowd for this dynamic duo of minimal tastiness. Come early and
peep the vibes at this new joint, you.ll dig it.


Esko - 201 Michigan Ave.

WINTERDELICA  - SAT. JANUARY 20, 2007 - Kin 127: BLUE PLANETARY HAND

Goahead Productions presents:

"Winterdelica"

A psychedelic winter celebration!

Live Sets:

*Mubali - (Trishula Recs, Mistress of Evil Records) California/Chicago, 
IL

Greg Farley has been involved in the psychedelic trance scene in
Northern California for over 5 years. After several years of being a
dj and event coordinator, he began to produce his own music in the
summer of 2003. Assisted and influenced by San Francisco artists such
as Quasar, Ocelot, the Nommos, Chromatone, and Penta. Mubali's music
began appearing on various labels like Mistress of Evil Records,
Geomagnetic TV, Trishula Records, Insomnia Recs, and Manic Dragon
Recs. In March of 2006, Trishula Records released Mubali's debut full
length titled "Cats at Play." His music style can be called nighttime,
aggressive, psychedelic music, and this year he has been doing a lot
of collaborations with many artists such as Naked Tourist, Highko,
Arahat, Bodhisattva 13:20, and Electrypnose. Be prepared for his sonic
onslaught and holographic textures.

*Xyla - (Mistress of Evil Records, Shaman Films) San Francisco/Medina, 
Ohio

Dark, abrasive, aggressive, and beautiful; these are words that
describe the sound of the well-known producer from San Francisco.  Her
experimental style draws upon several genres including industrial,
power noise, and trance.  Xyla brings us a new concept in what we call
dark electronic music. She has recently relocated from San Francisco
to Medina, Ohio, and we are very happy to have her here with us! For
those who missed her epic live set at Chimera, here is a rewind for
you with new tracks from her album.

Dj's:

*Lauryn - (Peak Records, 28thDay) New York City

This Goahead date with Lauryn is long overdue! Lauryn's passion for
music has been a constant all her life. She began playing the violin
when she was 9 years old. Her love of music led her to begin djing and
producing her own psytrance radio show while attending college. In
2002, Lauryn moved to Boston where she helped start Psyforia. Recently
relocated to New York City, Lauryn is a label dj with Peak Rec
(Switzerland) and is affiliated with 28thday(NYC) and Mistical
Productions(Texas). In the past six years, Lauryn has played across
the US and in Europe, sharing the stage with many well-known
international acts. She is known for her energetic, nighttime, funky
full-on, psychedelic sets, as well as the occasional morning
progressive grooves. Check out one of Lauryn's mixes at:

http://www.zia-trance.com/mp3s/lauryn-pinot-grigio.mp3

*Sweet Chaos - (Sidetrakkt, Be Here Now Collective) Pittsburgh

Well-known psytrance veteran, Sweet Chaos, comes to play for
Ohio, bringing a mish mash of mind bending, spirit mending, good ol'
fashioned shoe stompin' psytrance!

*Meghan - (Goahead) Cleveland/Akron

Our Meghan needs no introduction. She has been tearing it up all over
the U.S this year! Meghan will get things started and set the proper
mood for the evening. You can check out her live mix from Philadelphia
at the Gaian Mind monthly.

Fri Jan 26                        EXPANSION                         Detroit

United & famzine.com present...

EXPANSION

Alan Oldham / T-1000 - (chicago / berlin)
The proud Detroit thoroughbred of heralded quality and consistency, 
recording appearances with names such as Woody McBride, Dave Clarke, The 
Advent, and Marco Passarani; all of whom have recorded in a variety of 
sonically-challenging genres all on one ambitious record label. In 
addition to his Stateside appearances on Pure Sonik, Oldham struck close 
alliances with Tresor Records. DJ T-1000`s "Jetset Lovelife" EP was the 
first fruit of this all-new cooperation. The follow-up debut on Tresor, 
exclusive work entitled "Progress" became a cult classic. Owner of his 
new record label "Xfive", DJ T-1000 has always consistently turned out 
the most flexible documents to his personality. Whether DJ'ing worldwide 
or within his own productions, this fearless operator truly encompasses 
all that is "Electronica".

Bryan Zentz / Barada - (pdx)
Bryan is set to be at the forefront of the next wave of DJ / Producers. 
His DJ skills and live P.A.'s have to be witnessed first hand and the 
labels for which he has recorded for read like a Who's Who of techno 
music: from early output as Barada on Richie Hawtin's Definitive label, 
Dave Angel's Rotation, Felix Da Housecat's Clashbackk, slamming techno 
on mega-labels Primate & Jericho, dark electro as Bryan Never on 
Electrix, and many more. He has also recently completed a full length 
album for Carl Cox's label Intec. In 2004 Bryan started his own record 
label "Disruptor". Recent activity includes remixes of "My Life With The 
Thrill Kill Kult" with Ken Ishii, a mix CD on Germany's label Monoid, 
and upcoming singles on Gourmet and Intec Recordings.

MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters

1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Kevin C. Smith is a musician and (bedroom) producer who also turns
obsolete toys and children's keyboards into unique musical
instruments through circuit bending. He will give an overview of
circuit bending including what to bend and basic techniques. He will
also present and demonstrate such circuit bent instruments as the
voice changing megaphone, Speak & Spell, and Casio SK-1.
http://panafonic.blogspot.com

Garth Zeglin is a professional roboticist and a journeyman artist.
His day job is developing legged robots at the Carnegie Mellon
Robotics Institute, but his quest is finding his artistic voice in
more poetic machinery. His current projects include robots suspended
in the air, talking mirrors, and pneumatic percussion instruments. He
is fascinated by elegantly simple technology and dynamic behavior,
and he seeks to balance his love of gadgetry with the expressive
needs of the work. The talk will include a short overview of past
projects, then zoom in on current work, presenting both technical and
artistic rationales, and culminate in a live demo during the break.

There's also a Paul B track entitled You and Me that Yana Kay sings the
vocals on.  Its on his label Step 2 Zero.  I think its the first release so
the catalog number is s2z001 or something like that.

I need to buy a set of 1200s. Broke, used, whatever. I can buy one at
a time too if needed.

I already got mixer and sound.... I'm just sick of having to borrow
Trouts, and dont wanna mess them up.

It took me about 15 minutes to download, but I know Luke was having problems
and it took him a couple tries.  Maybe it's because a lot of people are
trying to DL it at the same time.  We both posted the mix on a lot of
different sites.  Keep trying. ;)

Just tried again:
Forbidden
You don't have permission to access
/files/goahead/meghan_instill-furor.mp3 on this server.

Looks like something is up with your hosting.

If I can get a full copy, I'll mirror it on my site for you. I have a
sick amount of bandwidth per month (plus I work for the company, so
they kind of tend to "look the other way" anyway...)

i'll keep trying.

I sent the link (digitalpetals) to my friend, Georg who is the director of
the goa/psy channel on di.fm and he was sent the following message from
Henry.  He's the one who put up my mix on digitalpetals:

'ok;

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE can you wait until after business hours to download
this?
i'm getting in trouble because our entire t1 is being saturated by my
webserver.

i will move the file downtown to our colo after work, and put up a 128kbps
version
for those that don't need/care for the 256k version here.

until then, you're cut off. now i'm getting back to doing something useful
:)

bye now,
henry'

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE can you wait until after business hours to download this?<br>
i&#39;m getting in trouble because our entire t1 is being saturated by my webserver.<br>
<br>
i will move the file downtown to our colo after work, and put up a 128kbps version<br>
for those that don&#39;t need/care for the 256k version here.<br>
<br>

Subject: {pb-cle} Nothing to do this Saturday? Check these out

If you're over 21, I'd suggest heading down to Deja Vu lounge to check
out Shock with The Breakbeat Militia come help get this new night off
the ground!

Not 21? or want to extend the night? Want to drop off your not-yet 21
friends and hook up with them later?

Come check out our house party, it's for Daisy and Rachel's Birthdays.
Probably starting between 9-11pm Saturday night, and ending Sunday
around 5pm.

There will be DJs, and music, the music of choice will be Drum and
Bass (Daisy and Rachel's favorite!)

We're gonna have some D&B tag team action.

So far the lineup is:

* RyuRy the Traveler vs. Damian Lauderbach (Ragga D&B)
* Dr Rockso vs. Ricky Skullcrusha (D&B)
* Doverspike vs. Rukkus (D&B)
* DJ Trix vs. ?
* More TBA, got quite a few awesome D&B DJs in the pending status.

Bring your own party supplies!

As always:
* No drugs.
* No minors.
* No underage drinking.

Hit me up for the address, it's in Pittsburgh, in the south side, a
few steps from 19th and Carson.

Yeah t1 is teh suck for file downloads.

Let me know once it works and I'll mirror it on my server (still  
getting the forbidden message and it's after 5:00 [!!]).  The only  
real limit my boss has told me is to keep the bandwidth under 10 mbit/ 
sec [sic].  He said no to running torrents on it it, pfft.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

I'm not sure if the club nights thing is more that there are an
overabundance of clubs and not enough patrons to go around so there's
more room for semi-successfull club nights with techno then there used
to be? Seems like the parties have good attendance if it stays down to
one a month. Last oct/nov there were a few parties with sad
attendance... I really expected to see more people make it out for
Paladin 5.1 than attended, but I think there had just been too many
parties in such a short time.

I've got my fingers crossed that things will pick up though... I think
people are sick of classic rock and hip hop... I know I am.

Thanks! Nice to meet you too! :) This was actually the first party I've
been to in about 2 years, which is dumbfounding. I kept having deja vu
feelings throughout the night, especially after spending time with a
newbie raver for a while ... I kept thinking 'This was me 10 years ago.
Nothing's changed.'

Eh, too many more would have made the place too hot. Thanks in part to my
low expectations, I had a perfectly great time.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} blitzen review

I prefer non-destructive silverware bending, as odd as a moment as it  
was, I did get a rise out of Amanda a few years ago at that akron  
pizza dive.

Bending spoons is a bitch, but check out http://youtube.com/watch? 
v=5rzysHrEOg0 sometime. Morgan Strebler, who performs walk-around  
magic at the Bellagio has a method of bending silverware ala Uri  
Gellar, but he really makes are of the silverware when it's done.  
He's a master at it, and while there is instructional material from  
him on his methods, no one does it better.

I doubt someone was doing that though...

I finally got it. after like 2 hours

http://files.vrillusions.com/download.php?id=goahead_djmeghan_instillfuror

It appears to be the full download, 114mb.  The length is jumping around
in media player classic (probably a VBR mp3) but looks to be around
1:17.  Is that about right, meghan?

heh that would explain why my bandwidth peaked to 8.8mbits/sec  
(around 1mb/sec) at one point :) Just happened to be looking at the  
traffic graph and saw this huge spike and was like "O NOES I R BEING  
HaX0ReD!"  Then I figured it was just you.  Surprised it didn't go  
higher, although glad it didn't either :)

There was a psytrance room at bring it back 3... tons of people loved it....

Anyhow this thread is just starting to suck... PGH has tons of good

to come check out local upcoming  D&B talent (plus an akron guy thrown
in for good measure). tomorrow at my house.

* Konstant vs RyuRy the Traveler (D&B)
* RyuRy the Traveler vs. Damian Lauderbach (Ragga D&B)
* Dr Rockso vs. Ricky Skullcrusha (D&B)
* Doverspike vs. Rukkus (D&B)
* DJ Kilo (D&B)
* DJ Trix (D&B)
* DJ Ende (D&B, possibly Trance at sunrise to calm us all down)

Ahh... This is the first I've heard about a psytrance room at BIB3.  Searching 
through my pb-cle-raves folder, I see that nobody bothered to announce BIB3 
here on the list.  And the rave-o-matic posts to the list never mentioned any 
psytrance DJs.

And, now that I look into it, BIB3 was in Wellsville.  Which, to someone 
carless like me, might as well be in another state.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

Yeah the night before BIB3, the local psy djs got together and made a
lineup for a room, borrowed sound, and did it all themselves for free.
So yeah there wasnt much time to announce it. Anyhow there were many
cars going that way with open seats. I actually missed it cause I was
down with the mad flu.

Anyhow not many people on this list even go to raves unless they are
getting paid so this aint the place to keep in touch with it all
anymore (sadly).

I'll post the next time I hear of some psytrance spinning in 412.
There IS a growing local psytrance movement though, with Erin spinning
it now, and Acid Dave, and the Orange Mantis. They are all motivated
to move the scene forward here, and I've heard talk of possibly an
upcoming psytrance party.

im talking about all the djs ive seen who play nothing but cds..  stolen 
music that is.

and you can tell since the quality of each tune changes when theyre 
playing their set.

in the past few months, ive seen it more than a hand full of times.

just saying. gotta keep it real there buddy.

<playing devil's advocate>

why is an import record 12 dollars for a single?  why is a double EP 17-20?

if the only people that you can get excited about electronic music is the
poor youth, then why knock em for at least wanting to play the music?

so yes, going cd is the only viable option for these kids, but why not
educate them on how they can still play digital music and pay for it?  there
are plenty of places that sell digital audio and most electronic groups
nowadays have some sort of digital presence.  They are kids, they need
direction, take em aside and let them know what's on your mind, but dont be
a jaded music snob about it :) ...

but also, if it's drum and bass we're talking about here, i cant blame em
for just downloading and pirating the music, cause the lifecycle of the hot
tracks is about 3.5 weeks.  :)

So playing music from a 1930s format (vinyl) on 1970's technology  
(turntables) is 'keeping it real'?  HAHAHAHA, yeah, whatever you say,

So if Im playing a gig that Im getting PAID FOR, and play music which 
was downloaded on some shit software for FREE.. then thats okay?..

copied - stolen.. whatever its fucking called. Dont sit back and candy 
coat it for them. Its obvious that's what these guys do. I wont mention 
names there in Pitt - but I played a gig and watched a number of these 
guys (who played before me) do an entire set of this shit. What makes it 
right?..   Seriously.

Oh wait - youre number one dj in the world. *rolls eyes*

candy coat my brown eye punk.

How do you know that they didn't simply buy the mp3's or whatever from 
Beatport or another online music store?  I mean, it's possible that 
they're doing this legit, correct?  I'm not saying that this is the case 
in most instances, which I'm sure it's not, but don't blame the medium, 
blame the people.  There are ways to play cd's, mp3's, final scratch, 
serato, whatever without stealing the music.  It may be obvious that 
this is what these dj's are doing, but it shouldn't be a blanket 
statement for everyone who uses cd's.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

Ed - You and I both know trying to educate is almost pointless anymore. 
Altho - I will say I pulled one of them aside last month (who Ive been 
friends with for a couple years) and politely said something to him. 
Really.. I just boil it down to this. I personally, will not support any 
promoter who thinks this kind of play is right, and or fair. I know, 
that there isnt a record store in Pitt anymore, but there STILL is no 
excuse for this kind of play at all. I never said that "strictly playing 
12 inch records was and will be the rules" because I play cds myself. 
BUT - I have never played music stolen, "copied" or anything in that 
nature.

Now - I do know alot of labels are releasing mp3s for use such as this, 
at a MUCH lower cost than say.. a imported 12" - but that still doesnt 
explain the sound quality theyre buying at (if they are)..

Do the math man. Ill take you out one night Ed, just to show you...  and 
its not just dnb either. Ive caught a breaks dj, and a house dj out 
there doing the same thing.

I think its insane.

http://www.bmi.com/licensing/

OK.  Then why not blame the promoters of raves who don't buy the proper 
licenses for the music being played?  I know for a fact there are bars 
and clubs and other venues that simply won't pay the licensing fee, yet 
continue to hold music events there.  In reality, there are a lot of 
people to blame for artists not getting their fair share of profits.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

I completely agree that it is bullshit that people are being booked to 
play sets of stolen music.  However, I'm also saying that there is a 
chain of responsibility.  Just because somebody buys some vinyl, it does 
not give him/her the right to play it out in front of a crowd for 
money.  Even if the DJ pays for all the music that they bring and plays 
a set of all store bought records, the artist is still getting ripped 
off because of the promoter (in many cases) not having the proper 
license.  I think this hurts producers of electronic music the most 
because they are not in the spotlight like pop stars are and if their 
music is played without a license there is not a team of lawyers on the 
case.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

I just think it's fucking hilarious that you care about such stupid shit  
and run around and
take notes and "catch" DJs doing what DJs do:  play music.

You're not going to be convinced the copyright is nothing more than big  
government protectionism, so I'll just laugh at you for running around  
clubs with a notebook asking DJs if they paid for the song they're  
playing.  hahahahaha

I think the deal is that people are making music and trying to make a 
living out of it, and even if they're good, they still can't make a dime 
because people aren't paying for it.  It hurts small time people from 
little labels, not big records labels from big corporations that have an 
assload of money.  I think the point is that if you like the music, 
support the artist, otherwise the music from that artist will dry up.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

Ill laugh at your next cry about getting paid for being a producer too..

I am a girl, who plays music and is very involved in my scene as well. 
Its not like I go to events to catch these fuckers doing this on purpose.

I dont even know why replying to you anyways. Your valid placement in 
the music industry is pointless anyways.

Good day

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

Honestly.. IF thats what it REALLY boils down to, then I guess they'd 
have a HUGE case on their hands. Im sure not every karaoke dj buys the 
music they play - know what I mean? Regardless if its country music or 
whatever, I just find it to be completely wack that its even allowed.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

Actually, it helps music as a whole, because it gets rid of those little  
indie crap labels that put out nothing but shit anyway (and are certainly  
in the wrong business being that it's 2007).  The quality of music as a  
whole goes up.

If you want to support an artist, GO SEE THEM PERFORM.  Pretty easy  
concept, huh?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

I've never once expected to get paid for producing.  I started producing  
in 1999 because the dnb scene went to complete shit (and still is complete  
shit) and I wanted good music to play out.

I still think it's funny that you actually care about this stuff,  
hahahahaha

Hrmm.  Perhaps an artist doesn't have the money to go on a tour that 
will take him/her into my area at all.  Maybe I can't afford to fly 
around the world to see an artist not from the US of A.  What is the 
plan then?  What about producers who don't PERFORM in front of crowds?  
Just leave them to rot?  Tell them they have to go out and perform even 
if their music speaks for itself?

Ha.  I thought being a musician would be the music first.  That being

BINGO

ASCAP and BMI fees, the 1001 difference licenses you are supposed to  
have to be anywhere they play music, etc.

Who the fuck cares. If you don't do a good job, there's no reason for  
someone to hire you again.

Only one thing matters: I'm working on a hardstyle version of the  
song from the first level of Altered Beast.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

look all im gonna say is dj's used to get paid to play....cuz promoters back 
when understood buying vinyl was a big investment...then all the nujacks  
came along...and decided to start spinning for free....now the promoters 
have this big ass pool of pretty much substandard talent that'll play for 
free...which hurts the real djs cuz now they cant buy as much vinyl....so 
they started producing...and getting mad LEGIT tracks for free cuz they were 
in the loop...all the little nujacks saw the real djs spinning cds and 
thought it was ok....so they jumped on soulseek or SOUR or whatever and 
started jacking tracks left and right...cuz they figured it was ok cuz they 
saw DJ whoever playing a cd of something they made themselves or got from 
producer whoever.

just my .02

and btw....whoever said ppl wont come out unless they get paid...fuck 
you...setting up a sound system is hard work...especially a big one...ill be 
damned if im gonna leave my sweet ass studio and setup a system i probably 
wont get to play my music on for free....shit used to be super professional 
in the pb-cle way back when....everyone was taken care of that put in the 
time/effort to put on a rave...now its just shady ass promoters(except for a 
few exceptions)trying to get everything for free ....expecting everyone to 
bow down to them cuz they're giving out comps if u spin or loan them 
something....i can count on 1 hand the number of professional crews in the 
pb-cle right now...oh yeah...and professional doesnt mean taking all the 
profits and getting some crack and smoking it behind the stage of the eagles 
nest.

p.ut

yeah like those guys really wanna bring their whole hardware rigs across the 
pond...when paradox was performing live in the states, he made every city 
dig up an atari st and an akai s-3000...he dont play live anymore cuz those

The licensing is questionable at best.  Most of the nearly unknown
artists that we all love and cherish are not under any kind of
protection by these agencies.  BMI was the main reason we killed off the
Chemlab internet radio station back in the day, even though I made
exactly ZERO dollars from the project (and violently refused requests
for us to advertise for anything but the music/labels we played).  The
majority of the music we played was donated by artists, or paid for by
myself.  They threatened us with lawyers, threatened our ISP, even
contacted my parents (who were like HUH).

These agencies use a lot of heavy handed tactics and are only motivated
by money.

I'm not saying stealing music is okay, but with everything involved, its
certainly a gray area.  Performance licensing is totally bogus though, IMHO.

Subject: [CastroKids] music trivia

So here we go.

I was watching "Evil Dead 2" on Friday night, and there's a scene
about 3/4 of the way in where two zombies are saying to the live
humans:

"We want what is yours -- LIFE!"

"Dead by dawn!"

And I remember that in the late 80's/early 90's, there was some sort
of dance track that sampled these.  Upon doing some research, what
comes CLOSEST is a track by Front Line Assembly, but I can't be sure
that's the one.  (No speakers at work.)

Does anyone have an idea of the song?  It's been so long, I can't
remember -- all I know is that they used to play it on WBER in
Rochester (the alt-rock station I dj'd for) waaaaay back in the day.
It was also a staple at a couple of the dance clubs I went to.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} is it just me....

<<and you can tell since the quality of each tune changes when theyre
playing their set.>>

when i switch back and forth between broken beat tracks that i've
ripped from vinyl/cd and the ones i've made myself in reason/ableton,
there's an audible difference (because i'm not skilled in the ways of
mastering yet).

i'm certainly not saying it doesn't happen, and i'd venture that even
50% of the time you're probably right, but just be careful that you
don't dismiss someone legit (like me) because some cheap assholes
can't be bothered. some of us out here are trying to do the right
thing.

in fact, i haven't played house/broken out-and-about since april-ish
because i haven't had the loot to spend on new music. expect that to
change soon. (new recorded set forthcoming.)

Subject: {pb-cle} Anyone have a gameport to Midi adapter cable

hey all.

I'm trying to help a friend get his Virus all MIDI-ified and the 
soundblaster card I gave him has the older style restangular gameport 
midi connection and the Virus has the newer style round connector.  I 
thought I had the adapter cable sitting around here (probably came 
with a "retail" box soundblaster at some point) but I don't have one.

Anyone got one of these sitting around or know where we can locally 
get one?  (Impatience! don't want to order it online, but here is 
what I need: http://www.podcastingnews.com/items/M-Audio/MIMSCMA6.htm )

Thanks.  Rest assured that it is NOT for me, so the music being made 
with it will come from a musically talented mind! haha.

wow. i had no idea. i always wondered what made chemlab go
bye-bye's...i thought it was just the demise of stargate....

so here's what i don't get...on what grounds did BMI have a case
against you if you were playing music that wasn't from their artists?
were they claiming some sort of "unfair competition" argument? or was
it simply harassment?

Nope, the physical server is still up and running at the same facility.
 We did catch some flack for the sheer amount of bandwidth we were
using,   though.

That's the thing, they had no case, they couldn't even provide example
violations.  But try telling that to their lawyers, without piles of
cash to pay for your own lawyers, while they are telling your ISP (where
I also worked at the time) that you are violating brodcasting
regulations.  It was just like the RIAA DMCA takedowns that get sent
daily to every ISP, but more personal.  You just can't fight them
without someone like the EFF backing you.  I didn't want to get fired
over it either.

I'm not sure what the regulations are like today.  This was before all
of the legislation, CARP, etc.

Okay kiddos...you have less than one week to purchase presales for
Winterdelica.  Presales are $10 and are available until January 15th.  You
can go directly to our website to purchase them (www.604head.com).  For
those who are are coming to our event, we highly encourage buying one
because the capacity of the venue is limited and we are getting a lot of
out-of-state response from: IN, WV, PA, MI, IL, WI and IA!  If you do not
buy a presale then we encourage you to please arrive as early as possible.
The event starts at 9:00 SHARP!  Hope to see a lot of you out! :)

Also, feel free to RSVP on myspace:

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Jan 19                        MO PRESHA                         Detroit

|| --Paxahau presents Mo' Presha-- || January 19th, 2007


Troy Pierce - M-nus
Raised in cornfields and brought up on the Midwest sound,
Troy moved to Berlin and started making a name for himself as
both a DJ and Producer 4 years ago. After extensive touring
with the M-nus crew both as part of the min2MAX tours and
opening slots for Mr. Hawtin he has the experience of the
world circuit under his belt. You don.t want to miss Troy.s
unique style of minimal goodness, mixed to perfection.

Marc Houle - M-nus
Undoubtedly fueled by the golden age of synthesizers,
Houle is captured by early 80.s synth pop and the underground-
turned-anthem classics of Acid House. There.s also no doubt that
the early years of minimal techno had their share of influence as
well (.Clock Width. is a subtle tribute to Dan Bell) inspiring his own
model of rhythm and resonance. Marc has been touring extensively
since his appearance at the Movement festival last year, fine-tuning
his live show as well as unleashing new gems onto the dance floor.
Quality techno, pristine soundscapes of rhythm, unabridged machine
grooves. Marc Houle represent.

Rich Korach - Paxahau
PaxaResident extraordinaire returns to let loose on the decks to warm
up the crowd for this dynamic duo of minimal tastiness. Come early and
peep the vibes at this new joint, you.ll dig it.


Esko - 201 Michigan Ave.
18 & up - Doors @ 10

WINTERDELICA  - SAT. JANUARY 20, 2007 - Kin 127: BLUE PLANETARY HAND

Goahead Productions presents:

"Winterdelica"

A psychedelic winter celebration!

Live Sets:

*Mubali - (Trishula Recs, Mistress of Evil Records) California/Chicago, 
IL

Greg Farley has been involved in the psychedelic trance scene in
Northern California for over 5 years. After several years of being a
dj and event coordinator, he began to produce his own music in the
summer of 2003. Assisted and influenced by San Francisco artists such
as Quasar, Ocelot, the Nommos, Chromatone, and Penta. Mubali's music
began appearing on various labels like Mistress of Evil Records,
Geomagnetic TV, Trishula Records, Insomnia Recs, and Manic Dragon
Recs. In March of 2006, Trishula Records released Mubali's debut full
length titled "Cats at Play." His music style can be called nighttime,
aggressive, psychedelic music, and this year he has been doing a lot
of collaborations with many artists such as Naked Tourist, Highko,
Arahat, Bodhisattva 13:20, and Electrypnose. Be prepared for his sonic
onslaught and holographic textures.

*Xyla - (Mistress of Evil Records, Shaman Films) San Francisco/Medina, 
Ohio

Dark, abrasive, aggressive, and beautiful; these are words that
describe the sound of the well-known producer from San Francisco.  Her
experimental style draws upon several genres including industrial,
power noise, and trance.  Xyla brings us a new concept in what we call
dark electronic music. She has recently relocated from San Francisco
to Medina, Ohio, and we are very happy to have her here with us! For
those who missed her epic live set at Chimera, here is a rewind for
you with new tracks from her album.

Dj's:

*Lauryn - (Peak Records, 28thDay) New York City

This Goahead date with Lauryn is long overdue! Lauryn's passion for
music has been a constant all her life. She began playing the violin
when she was 9 years old. Her love of music led her to begin djing and
producing her own psytrance radio show while attending college. In
2002, Lauryn moved to Boston where she helped start Psyforia. Recently
relocated to New York City, Lauryn is a label dj with Peak Rec
(Switzerland) and is affiliated with 28thday(NYC) and Mistical
Productions(Texas). In the past six years, Lauryn has played across
the US and in Europe, sharing the stage with many well-known
international acts. She is known for her energetic, nighttime, funky
full-on, psychedelic sets, as well as the occasional morning
progressive grooves. Check out one of Lauryn's mixes at:

http://www.zia-trance.com/mp3s/lauryn-pinot-grigio.mp3

*Sweet Chaos - (Sidetrakkt, Be Here Now Collective) Pittsburgh

Well-known psytrance veteran, Sweet Chaos, comes to play for
Ohio, bringing a mish mash of mind bending, spirit mending, good ol'
fashioned shoe stompin' psytrance!

*Meghan - (Goahead) Cleveland/Akron

Our Meghan needs no introduction. She has been tearing it up all over
the U.S this year! Meghan will get things started and set the proper
mood for the evening. You can check out her live mix from Philadelphia
at the Gaian Mind monthly.

United & famzine.com present...

EXPANSION

Alan Oldham / T-1000 - (chicago / berlin)
The proud Detroit thoroughbred of heralded quality and consistency, 
recording appearances with names such as Woody McBride, Dave Clarke, The 
Advent, and Marco Passarani; all of whom have recorded in a variety of 
sonically-challenging genres all on one ambitious record label. In 
addition to his Stateside appearances on Pure Sonik, Oldham struck close 
alliances with Tresor Records. DJ T-1000`s "Jetset Lovelife" EP was the 
first fruit of this all-new cooperation. The follow-up debut on Tresor, 
exclusive work entitled "Progress" became a cult classic. Owner of his 
new record label "Xfive", DJ T-1000 has always consistently turned out 
the most flexible documents to his personality. Whether DJ'ing worldwide 
or within his own productions, this fearless operator truly encompasses 
all that is "Electronica".

Bryan Zentz / Barada - (pdx)
Bryan is set to be at the forefront of the next wave of DJ / Producers. 
His DJ skills and live P.A.'s have to be witnessed first hand and the 
labels for which he has recorded for read like a Who's Who of techno 
music: from early output as Barada on Richie Hawtin's Definitive label, 
Dave Angel's Rotation, Felix Da Housecat's Clashbackk, slamming techno 
on mega-labels Primate & Jericho, dark electro as Bryan Never on 
Electrix, and many more. He has also recently completed a full length 
album for Carl Cox's label Intec. In 2004 Bryan started his own record 
label "Disruptor". Recent activity includes remixes of "My Life With The 
Thrill Kill Kult" with Ken Ishii, a mix CD on Germany's label Monoid, 
and upcoming singles on Gourmet and Intec Recordings.

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Kevin C. Smith is a musician and (bedroom) producer who also turns
obsolete toys and children's keyboards into unique musical
instruments through circuit bending. He will give an overview of
circuit bending including what to bend and basic techniques. He will
also present and demonstrate such circuit bent instruments as the
voice changing megaphone, Speak & Spell, and Casio SK-1.

Garth Zeglin is a professional roboticist and a journeyman artist.
His day job is developing legged robots at the Carnegie Mellon
Robotics Institute, but his quest is finding his artistic voice in
more poetic machinery. His current projects include robots suspended
in the air, talking mirrors, and pneumatic percussion instruments. He
is fascinated by elegantly simple technology and dynamic behavior,
and he seeks to balance his love of gadgetry with the expressive
needs of the work. The talk will include a short overview of past
projects, then zoom in on current work, presenting both technical and
artistic rationales, and culminate in a live demo during the break.

Subject: {pb-cle} Not a hoover, but a dyson!

so i was at doverspikes the other day and we were fiddlin with the 
Virus he got for Xmas.

Not only is there a "Hoover" setting, which produces the expected 
response, but there is a "Dyson" setting that sounds ALMOST like a 
hoover but not quite.

I wonder which came first? the synth or the vac?

haha

Jaded? Who's jaded?

www.goaheadproductions.com

Thursday (1-18) evening

$15 reservation tickets can still

The door price will also be $15. *This is an informal,
white party. Attendees arriving in all white
will receive the $10 presale price at the door.

Hope to see you!

Whoa man.  I didn't know you were so all about whitey.  I mean, just 
because the demographic of raves is usually suburban white kids 
doesn't mean others aren't welcome to attend!

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

For the opening night of Ritual we have prepared a rare
and special treat, a reunion of sorts not only in bringing
these scratchmasters back together from the cities where
they now reside.  But also a long overdue reunion with
Pittsburgh to put on a show not seen here since the
Zodiac parties of 2001 once again deliver a 4 turntable
tag teamset, stage show and music that can take you
places that will touch your mind body and soul for a lifetime.

Fri Jan 19                        MO PRESHA                         Detroit

|| --Paxahau presents Mo' Presha-- || January 19th, 2007


Troy Pierce - M-nus
Raised in cornfields and brought up on the Midwest sound,
Troy moved to Berlin and started making a name for himself as
both a DJ and Producer 4 years ago. After extensive touring
with the M-nus crew both as part of the min2MAX tours and
opening slots for Mr. Hawtin he has the experience of the
world circuit under his belt. You don.t want to miss Troy.s
unique style of minimal goodness, mixed to perfection.

Marc Houle - M-nus
Undoubtedly fueled by the golden age of synthesizers,
Houle is captured by early 80.s synth pop and the underground-
turned-anthem classics of Acid House. There.s also no doubt that
the early years of minimal techno had their share of influence as
well (.Clock Width. is a subtle tribute to Dan Bell) inspiring his own
model of rhythm and resonance. Marc has been touring extensively
since his appearance at the Movement festival last year, fine-tuning
his live show as well as unleashing new gems onto the dance floor.
Quality techno, pristine soundscapes of rhythm, unabridged machine
grooves. Marc Houle represent.

Rich Korach - Paxahau
PaxaResident extraordinaire returns to let loose on the decks to warm
up the crowd for this dynamic duo of minimal tastiness. Come early and
peep the vibes at this new joint, you.ll dig it.

WINTERDELICA  - SAT. JANUARY 20, 2007 - Kin 127: BLUE PLANETARY HAND

Goahead Productions presents:

"Winterdelica"

A psychedelic winter celebration!

Live Sets:

*Mubali - (Trishula Recs, Mistress of Evil Records) California/Chicago, 
IL

Greg Farley has been involved in the psychedelic trance scene in
Northern California for over 5 years. After several years of being a
dj and event coordinator, he began to produce his own music in the
summer of 2003. Assisted and influenced by San Francisco artists such
as Quasar, Ocelot, the Nommos, Chromatone, and Penta. Mubali's music
began appearing on various labels like Mistress of Evil Records,
Geomagnetic TV, Trishula Records, Insomnia Recs, and Manic Dragon
Recs. In March of 2006, Trishula Records released Mubali's debut full
length titled "Cats at Play." His music style can be called nighttime,
aggressive, psychedelic music, and this year he has been doing a lot
of collaborations with many artists such as Naked Tourist, Highko,
Arahat, Bodhisattva 13:20, and Electrypnose. Be prepared for his sonic
onslaught and holographic textures.

*Xyla - (Mistress of Evil Records, Shaman Films) San Francisco/Medina, 
Ohio

Dark, abrasive, aggressive, and beautiful; these are words that
describe the sound of the well-known producer from San Francisco.  Her
experimental style draws upon several genres including industrial,
power noise, and trance.  Xyla brings us a new concept in what we call
dark electronic music. She has recently relocated from San Francisco
to Medina, Ohio, and we are very happy to have her here with us! For
those who missed her epic live set at Chimera, here is a rewind for
you with new tracks from her album.

Dj's:

*Lauryn - (Peak Records, 28thDay) New York City

This Goahead date with Lauryn is long overdue! Lauryn's passion for
music has been a constant all her life. She began playing the violin
when she was 9 years old. Her love of music led her to begin djing and
producing her own psytrance radio show while attending college. In
2002, Lauryn moved to Boston where she helped start Psyforia. Recently
relocated to New York City, Lauryn is a label dj with Peak Rec
(Switzerland) and is affiliated with 28thday(NYC) and Mistical
Productions(Texas). In the past six years, Lauryn has played across
the US and in Europe, sharing the stage with many well-known
international acts. She is known for her energetic, nighttime, funky
full-on, psychedelic sets, as well as the occasional morning
progressive grooves. Check out one of Lauryn's mixes at:

http://www.zia-trance.com/mp3s/lauryn-pinot-grigio.mp3

*Sweet Chaos - (Sidetrakkt, Be Here Now Collective) Pittsburgh

Well-known psytrance veteran, Sweet Chaos, comes to play for
Ohio, bringing a mish mash of mind bending, spirit mending, good ol'
fashioned shoe stompin' psytrance!

*Meghan - (Goahead) Cleveland/Akron

Our Meghan needs no introduction. She has been tearing it up all over
the U.S this year! Meghan will get things started and set the proper
mood for the evening. You can check out her live mix from Philadelphia
at the Gaian Mind monthly.

United & famzine.com present...

EXPANSION

Alan Oldham / T-1000 - (chicago / berlin)
The proud Detroit thoroughbred of heralded quality and consistency, 
recording appearances with names such as Woody McBride, Dave Clarke, The 
Advent, and Marco Passarani; all of whom have recorded in a variety of 
sonically-challenging genres all on one ambitious record label. In 
addition to his Stateside appearances on Pure Sonik, Oldham struck close 
alliances with Tresor Records. DJ T-1000`s "Jetset Lovelife" EP was the 
first fruit of this all-new cooperation. The follow-up debut on Tresor, 
exclusive work entitled "Progress" became a cult classic. Owner of his 
new record label "Xfive", DJ T-1000 has always consistently turned out 
the most flexible documents to his personality. Whether DJ'ing worldwide 
or within his own productions, this fearless operator truly encompasses 
all that is "Electronica".

Bryan Zentz / Barada - (pdx)
Bryan is set to be at the forefront of the next wave of DJ / Producers. 
His DJ skills and live P.A.'s have to be witnessed first hand and the 
labels for which he has recorded for read like a Who's Who of techno 
music: from early output as Barada on Richie Hawtin's Definitive label, 
Dave Angel's Rotation, Felix Da Housecat's Clashbackk, slamming techno 
on mega-labels Primate & Jericho, dark electro as Bryan Never on 
Electrix, and many more. He has also recently completed a full length 
album for Carl Cox's label Intec. In 2004 Bryan started his own record 
label "Disruptor". Recent activity includes remixes of "My Life With The 
Thrill Kill Kult" with Ken Ishii, a mix CD on Germany's label Monoid, 
and upcoming singles on Gourmet and Intec Recordings.

HIGH TECH SOUL is the first documentary to tackle the deep roots of 
techno music alongside the cultural history of Detroit, its birthplace. 
>From the race riots of 1967 to the underground party scene of the late 
1980s, Detroit's economic downturn didn't stop the invention of a new 
kind of music that brought international attention to its producers and 
their hometown.

Featuring in-depth interviews with many of the world's best exponents of 
the artform, High Tech Soul focuses on the creators of the genre -- Juan 
Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson -- and looks at the 
relationships and personal struggles behind the music. Artists like 
Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Eddie Fowlkes and a host of 
others explain why techno, with its abrasive tones and resonating 
basslines, could not have come from anywhere but Detroit.

With classic anthems such as Rhythim Is Rhythim's "Strings of Life" and 
Inner City's "Good Life," High Tech Soul celebrates the pioneers, the 
promoters and the city that spawned a global phenomenon.

The film features: Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Eddie 
(Flashin) Fowlkes, Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, John Acquaviva, Carl Cox, 
Carl Craig, Blake Baxter, Stacey Pullen, Thomas Barnett, Matthew Dear, 
Anthony "Shake" Shakir, Keith Tucker, Delano Smith, Mike Archer, Derrick 
Thompson, Mike Clark, Alan Oldham, Laura Gavoor, Himawari, Scan 7, Kenny 
Larkin, Stacey "Hotwax" Hale, Claus Bachor, Electrifying Mojo, Niko 
Marks, Barbara Deyo, Dan Sordyl, Sam Valenti, Ron Murphy, George Baker, 
and Kwame Kilpatrick.

The film's soundtrack includes: Aux 88, Cybotron, Inner City, Juan 
Atkins, Mayday, Model 500, Plastikman, Rhythim Is Rhythim, and more. 


"Bredow's cast of alumni -- the holy trinity of Atkins, May & Saunderson 
at the front -- fill out this tale with passion, pride and, oddly for 
music of the future, nostalgia too."
- Dazed and Confused
 

"An enjoyable education into the music, the city and the main players 
past, present and future."
-DJ Magazine
 

"Defines the myths and the magic of Detroit techno from its beginnings 
right up to how it has evolved to become High Tech Soul."
-Derrick May
 

Location: Cleveland

Tek-know? will be hosting a screening of the movie High Tech Soul to be 
followed by another night of Tek-Know madness.


They will also have Gary Bredow, the film's writer, director, and 
producer, in for a Q & A session after the screening.<br>

Alan Oldham (T-1000)

One of Detroit's most talented and venerated techno mixers, DJ T-1000 
has been instrumental in the Motor City scene as a label-head and 
producer as well as DJ. Born Alan Oldham, he spent time as a 
graphic-design specialist and comics illustrator while studying media at 
Detroit's Wayne State University. Hired by Derrick May to illustrate the 
sleeves on a few Transmat releases, Oldham became interested in 
Detroit's electronic scene, and gradually transformed his Fast Forward 
radio program on WDET from industrial and fusion into techno. During the 
show's run, from 1987 to 1992, Oldham introduced thousands of area 
listeners to Detroit techno via productions from May, Kevin Saunderson, 
Juan Atkins, Underground Resistance, and Carl Craig . as well as other 
techno figures like Joey Beltram, Moby, 808 State, and LFO. The show 
ended in 1992 when an offer to tour with Underground Resistance as the 
replacement DJ for Jeff Mills proved too difficult to resist. Also in 
1992, he formed his own Generator label, the origin of seminal releases 
by Oldham projects like X-313 ("Interferon," "World Sonik Domination") 
and TXC-1 as well as tracks by Dave Clarke and Woody McBride. In 1996, 
Oldham closed Generator and opened a new label, Pure Sonik. He also 
began DJing around the world, gaining a reputation as one of the best 
Detroit DJs among considerable competition. The DJ T-1000 mix albums 
Supercollider (a Generator label retrospective) and Live Sabotage: Live 
in Belgium displayed his mixing genius, while his debut production 
full-length, Progress, appeared on Tresor in 1999. Oldham also began 
recording another album, for Astralwerks. In addition, he has recorded 
for Djax-Up-Beats, Matrix, and Communique, and done remix work for Terry 
Lee Brown, Jr. and the Punisher.

Saturday, March 24th, 2007
D.P.S. (DETROIT PARANORMAL SOCIETY) also known as..... Local 313 presents....

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Subject: {pb-cle} Winterdelica Venue and Directions

The Venue address is:

170 W. Tallmadge Ave.
Akron, OH 44301

General directions:

There are many ways to get here, but
the best way to locate the venue without
getting lost is from Ohio State route 8. and
exit from the north on Tallmadge Avenue.
or from the south on Gorge Blvd towards
Tallmadge Ave. Once you are on Tallmadge
Ave. the venue is very easy to find.

>From the North (Cleveland):
Take the ramp onto I-77 S toward Akron
Merge onto I-80 E via the I-80/
OH-21 exit 146 to Ohio Tpke/
Toledo/Youngstown, Merge onto OH-8 S via
the I-90/OH-8 exit 180, Take the Tallmadge Ave exit
Turn right at E Tallmadge Ave

>From points east take 1-76 W (Pittsburgh)
Merge onto OH-8 N via exit 23B to Cuyahoga Falls
Exit at Gorge Blvd toward Tallmadge Ave
Turn left at E Tallmadge Ave

>From points south ( Columbus)
>From 71 north, Merge onto I-76 E/US-224 E via
the I-76/US-224 exit 209 to Lodi/Akron
Take the exit onto I-76 E toward Akron
Merge onto OH-8 N (exit will be on left)
Exit at Gorge Blvd toward Tallmadge Ave
Turn left at E Tallmadge Ave


>From points west (Chicago/Toledo)
I-80 E, Merge onto OH-8 S via the I-90/OH-8 exit 180
Take the Tallmadge Ave exit, Turn right at E Tallmadge Ave


Continue on Tallmadge avenue down the hill. The Venue
will be on the left hand side. It is a white garage/warehouse
with a big advertising sign on the top of the building and
located next to a small auto sales dealer. If you drive past
a gas station (located on the right hand side of the road)
you have gone too far.

Parking will be very limited at the venue so please park on
sidestreets and please respect the neighborhood.
Also do not park in the Metroparks parking lot down
the street.

The event starts at 9 p.m. We recommend getting here as early
as possible due to limited capacity.

This event is 18 and over. Please remember to bring your id
with you. Do not bring any drugs, markers, or weapons.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Xone, Mixed in Key

So...I'm confused...

Is it a plugin for other software, a standalone program that scans
your files and appends its info to the ID3 tag, or is it actually its
own mixing software??

I think it's weird that there's not screen shots...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Xone, Mixed in Key

 From http://mixedinkey.com/HowTo.aspx:

The Mixed In Key Ritual

1. Use Mixed In Key to scan your music before every gig.

2. Write down your results on CD labels and vinyl sleeves. Change  
your file names if needed. When you're playing live, you will have to  
reference this key.

3. While you are playing, pick compatible songs using the Camelot  
notation. Avoid key clashes.

4. Remember the crowd response and write down which songs performed  
the best.

5. Use the same mixes on your music CDs for maximum impact!

You can use this ritual to improve your DJ mixing.

Would be awfully nice if they'd build something to change keys into
Serato or Final Scratch, on the fly.

As opposed to sucking, I guess.

Have you even looked a squirrel in the eyes? Solid. Black.

And you know about the trouble I've been having with squirrel eyes.

from same page:

"Many famous DJs use harmonic mixing to supplement their beatmatching  
technique. From Sasha to Paul Oakenfold..."

That's all I need to see, I'll pass.  K? thx.

I find it easier to just mix what sounds good.  If two songs sound  
good together, keep track of it.  Whether they sound good because of  
key harmonics, or the basslines don't clash with each other (which I  
guess could be different keys), doesn't really matter.  I've never  
talked to anyone about a dj and they say "That guy really knew his  
key harmonics."  It's either "that was awesome" or "Who in their  
right mind would ever book such a POS"

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Xone, Mixed in Key

I think it's purely dependent upon what type of music you're mixing,
and there's a lot more in play than just key...

OK, maybe not for Oakenfold's cheese-trance tendencies of years past
(he's on a more electro tip now). This would work perfectly if you had
a crate full of homogenous schlock.

But I've heard many a set for many a year that existed before this
sort of technology, and they kicked all KINDS of ass without needing
to match key. Even all the way back to the disco years, when records
had gobs and gobs of vocals and melodies...

A lot of people mention when mixes are in key more often than not, though 
these people are usually the sober ones who are actually paying attention.

Mixing in key generally sounds better, and any DJ who knows his tunes just 
knows what tunes go together best, and a lot of the time it is because they 
are in the same key.

Seems to me like you are hating on what you consider to be "pop techno"; 
Whether you like their record taste, Sasha and Oakenfold are where they are 
at because they have a pretty solid grasp on what sounds pleasing to the 
ear.

In teh case of more melodic music, key makes a huge difference, which is 
probably why more "trancier" styles (Oakenfold, Sasha) are much more 
dependant on key. Two clashing melodies sounds like complete garbage if its 
not in key.

Have you ever heard a live set from Oakenfold? trainwrecks do not  
sound pleasing to the ear.  I have yet to hear a LIVE set from  
oakenfold that sounded like shit.  Key word is "live".  His studio  
mixes are pretty solid, though.  Also he's put out some good tracks.   
Just don't ever put him in front of a couple turntables.  I haven't  
heard any live sets from sasha, so can't comment there.  I really  
think Oakenfold was just extremely lucky to get where he was at, it  
wasn't by talent.  I've heard several local djs that could blow  
Oakenfold out of the water in both technical skills and just  
generally not being assholes.  While that includes people that don't  
spin trance, I've heard some great trance sets in Toronto on more  
than one occasion.

...Damn, maybe I have become jaded already?  Nah, I always thought  
Oakenfold sucked

What's interesting is that it seems like those who worry about mixing in ke=
y
tend to also be the ones that are completely tone deaf and/or have no taste
in music and are playing garbage to begin with.  If you have a good ear for
your tunes you won't clash, and anyway, you are playing your tunes at +/-
the zero point in pitch anyway, so if someone who had perfect pitch was
listening, they would find it unbearable anyway.

the only time i actually paid money for a show involving oakenfold was when
i went to chicago a couple years back and saw him, sasha & digweed, and the
chemical brothers (remember that tour?)... he actually played a pretty
killer set there, but i had reservations that he was playing it off DAT
since it didnt appear he was doing much in terms of mixing...  so the only
time i heard him live it was decent.  but i've heard other stories that fit
more with your description todd.

Yeah, I've heard the DAT stories, too.  Ironically enough, just find  
a set he played on radio 1.  I don't think it was his first "big  
break" mix I listened to but I've listened to a couple of those and  
it sounded bad, and this was before I knew what trainwrecking was.  I  
just know it "didn't sound right" between a lot of the tracks.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Xone, Mixed in Key

I've actually never heard Oakenfold live, I have heard the same about his 
live decks mixing. I was more referring to his studio experience. I honestl 
ytthink he knows that trainwrecks sound bad, just as much as key clashes, 
but I am skeptical to whether he gives a shit or not.

Sasha on the other hand does a pretty good job in the mix, though recently 
hes been using his custom designed Abelton controller. He probably 
pre-fabricates the sets that he knows are going to be widely distributed, I 
don't really know.

I don't ever listen to Oakenfold, and Sasha's music taste I enjoy about 50% 
of the time.

Regardless, when it comes to harmony and melody, keeping things in the same 
key is a pretty big deal more often than not, and shouldn't be looked over, 
whether you like using those guys as exxamples or not.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Xone, Mixed in Key

That sounds like a harsh generalization to me, but I am pretty confident 
most DJs & producers who care about what they are doing are playing music 
they like; whether you think its good or not is irrelevant.

A good ear for mixing and personal taste in music are two different things; 
Its pretty pompous for you to tell people what they enjoy is either good or 
bad; there always seems to be a consistent "clash of beliefs" when this 
topic comes up...

Well, I don't know about you, but some people when they talk about key
matching, they're not even really clear on what a "key" is or how it can
possibly be matched, or how playing an entire set in one key might
completely exclude a decent portion of one's selections.  I don't really
care so much about what a DJ enjoys, rather what they are subjecting my ear=
s
to, and if it's pompous to have a harsh opinion about what I consider
garbage, then call me pompous.  I think it's much more interesting for
people to have strong likes and dislikes than to like everything mildly, or
even worse, like everything strongly.  And all I was saying, was  based on
my my limited, anecdotal experience with people who were excited about "key
matching," which I found amusing.

And I agree with you, there is no cure for bad taste.  At least, that's wha=
t
I think you were saying.

<br>&gt;<br>&gt;What&#39;s interesting is that it seems like those who worr=

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Xone, Mixed in Key

As a non-DJ who took piano for 5 years and clarinet for 8, the very term
"key matching" sounds strange to me. One can create unpleasant, dissonant
tones within any key. Maybe "chord matching" would make more sense to me.

Anybody play in a jazz band? Ever do improvs? I had a brief stint as a
tenor sax player but without knowing the instrument backwards and forwards
I had a hard time doing improvs that didn't sound like ass. Any musician
should know what does and doesn't sound good ... this 'key matching' thing
sounds a little too obvious to be discussed this seriously.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Xone, Mixed in Key

To be honest, I personally don't even pay attention to keys. I just play 
whatever tunes I feel should be play at that particular moment in time... 
but it really sucks when t he "keys end up clashing" and the strings, 
chords, or melodies sound absolutely terrible together.

If this program could accurately tell me what keys my tunes were in, I could 
test it, and possibly try to use it to my advantage when selecting records. 
It might help me to be more decisive when selecting tunes, but it might 
psyche me out and hinder me... maybe I might start limiting myself to keys, 
etc. like you said? This would of course be a responsibility I would have to 
be aware of if I want to keep my set enjoyable (in my eyes, hopefully 
yours).

Ideally I would like to be able to mix melodies and strings together and 
have them sound good, or have to worry less if said melodies or strings may 
pose a problem to an incoming mix. I may be more bold in my mixing if I 
don't have to worry about these "key clashses". I'm sure you know more than 
me about keys and such, I wasn't claiming to be an expert.

Yeah you're right... and sometimes those dissonant tones sound cool!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Xone, Mixed in Key

I've seen Oakenfold a handful of times...he was pretty great back in
the days of U2's Zoo TV tour.

Last time I saw him was @ Metropol (00 or 01...i think it was the tour
promoting his "Tranceport" release)...and I thought (at the time) that
his mixing was "meh" at best. I'd like to hear a copy of that show to
find out if I was right or it was the booze and [other]. I thought the
two openers he had were better (one of which was D'Fuse from TX...).

I question the validity of letting the key of the song determine what
you're going to play next rather than reading the crowd (assuming you
have one) and choosing a song appropriate to where you want to take
the set.

But that makes me 50% a hypocrite, because there are plenty of people
around here who say that about me DJ'ing with the computer...where I
have all the BPM's and everything right in front of me, and with one
touch, I can match the tempo of a song within 1/100th of a beat.

I suppose, like anything else, if you use it to help your creativity,
it's good. If you use it as a crutch, it's bad.

i think you both are slightly misunderstanding each other.

i see what you're both saying here, Adam is saying some people just pick
garbage tunes (not from a preference standpoint, but tunes that just aren't
produced very well or that don't have many true musical qualities) what mos=
t
would either consider 'gimmick' tunes or 'filler' tunes.  and these tunes
are garbage because sometimes the levels were just not right for the
instrumentation that the song was produced with, or the equipment that the
tune was made with was not to the quality that it needed to be to match the
intent of the track.  Paul is coming from the preference point (and i don't
think Adam is attacking the genre, even though in the past the progressive
sound has taken a hit here from genre snobs [tom "you have bad taste in
music" cox for example]).  now putting together both of these ideas is what
is at the root of this tangent, it's not about bad music, it's about poorly
produced music, and furthermore if poorly produced (or poor sound quality
digital) music is then put through a key analyzer, it still will end up
being a poorly produced track and will probably sound like shit in a mix,
but will sound somewhat better if it's mixed in key.  AND then add in the
element of WHO is playing it and how they program their sets.  some newbie
cd-dj (no i don't mean you mark) playing the hot tracks that they downloade=
d
that have different levels of quality in sampling rate / normalization / or
anything that contributes to a 'lossy format' is going to sound more like
garbage, than say, someone who is a seasoned veteran playing records that
are produced well and mastered well (and even ripped all with the same
process to digital for use with final scratch/serato)... and to get back on
subject - i don't think that any software can replace experience of a dj in
knowing how to select a program, but key can help.  In my opinion, you'd be
better off buying a Casio keyboard and learning your popular keys of
whatever genre you use, that way you can really learn more about your music=
,
and even use it to classify your vinyl without having to rip it to
digital... if you get really good on the Casio keyboard you could even one
day become popular like Wesley Willis (rip - my 2007 tribute).

Subject: [dorkbotpgh-announce] dorkbot pittsburgh is next Thursday, 25 Jan
To: dorkbotpgh-announce@dorkbot.org

Next Meeting: 7:30pm, January 25, 2007

We have three (yes, three!) speakers this month, so we will start at
7:30pm sharp. Our speakers are:

Kazuhiro Jo, Ph.D. student researching auditory interaction design at
the University of Tokyo. Kazuhiro is a co-founder of dorkbot tokyo
and acts as a member of The SINE WAVE ORCHESTRA, a member of Monalisa
project, a member of a performance unit "aeo" with eye (e.g.
Boredoms) and Taeji Sawai(e.g. portabole[k]ommunity).

Jacob Ciocci, Paper Rad. Jacob is a founding member of the art group
Paper Rad. Paper Rad synthesizes popular material from television,
comics, video games, and advertising, allowing these materials to
contextualize and cross-reference each other. Within Paper Rad,
Jacob's animations, web art, music, and performances address the
relationship between belief, transcendence and popular culture.

Roger Dannenberg is an Associate Research Professor in the School of
Computer Science and School of Art at CMU. He is internationally
known for his research in the field of computer music. His current
work includes research on computer accompaniment of live musicians,
content-based music retrieval, interactive media, and high-level
languages for sound synthesis. Among other projects, Dannenberg and
his colleagues created "McBlare", a robotic bagpiper.

dorkbot pittsburgh meets at Brillobox (meeting info and maps).
Admission is always free and open to the public. dorkbot pittsburgh
is a non-smoking event, but you're free to smoke downstairs in the
bar.

I'm hoping that on-dash GPS will merge with on-dash radar detectors,
integrate to your cellphone as a bluetooth wireless headset, and let

The technology's been there for a few years, but no one seems all that
interested in integrating more than anyone else.

That'd be sweet.  A few months ago someone did that so they can  
interact with Second Life using VR [sic] headsets  and stuff.  Used  
some wireless internet service that I guess is faster than using a  
regular cell phone connection and stuff.  I've always wanted to have  
one of those little screens that you put over one eye so basically  
the picture "floats" in your vision.  And then come up with some wild  
answer when someone asks what I'm watching in that viewfinder.  And  
in reality I'll just be playing tetris :)

True. Though I do think that you can make generalizations about 
needing things to at least be in a Major or Minor mode.

Some DJs take the stuff purrrrrty seriously....I've shown this to 
a lot of people before, but here's the homework Anthony Pappa does 
on his music - peep the photo: http://tinyurl.com/yw3552

Don't know if any of you will be playing this, but someone hacked the bonus
tracks (before the game is even out).
 
And apparently, one of the bonus songs will be none other than "TROGDOR"

I spent the week with some road warrior type vendors, and as smart  
phone carrying types for decades, they had a resounding opinion on  
the iPhone.

Retarded.

They really screwed the pooch with no third party apps. SSH'ing to a  
server and a lot of other activities made possible by third party  
apps are the reason smart phones really took off.

The on screen keyboard? Rediculous. I've got a Nokia 770, and an on  
screen keyboard is difficult if best to use -- and it's 2x - 3x  
bigger than the one on the iPhone. You're going to be using that  
keyboard a lot, for inputting those google directions, etc. and it's  
just difficult to use.

The video? It's NOT 16x9, stuff is going to be letterboxed.

It's going to be a small fortune to operate one. $500 for the cheap  
one, and I'm guessing around $120 a month for the voice +  data plan  
($100 for my treo on verizon, cingular's data is slightly more  
expensive). An expensive way to read your email and show everyone  
pictures of your dog. The voicemail is about the only productive  
thing on it.

  With Arrest of DJ Drama, the Law Takes Aim at Mixtapes


By KELEFA SANNEH 
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/kelefa_sanneh/index.html?inline=nyt-per>
Published: January 18, 2007

In the world of hip-hop few music executives have more influence than DJ 
Drama. His Gangsta Grillz compilations have helped define this 
decades Southern rap explosion. He has been instrumental in the careers 
of rappers like Young Jeezy and Lil Wayne. He appears on the cover of 
the March issue of the hip-hop magazine XXL, alongside his friend and 
business partner T.I., the top-selling rapper of 2006. And later this 
year DJ Drama is scheduled to make his Atlantic Records debut with 
Gangsta Grillz: The Album.

Now DJ Drama is yet another symbol of the music industrys turmoil and 
confusion.

On Tuesday night he was arrested with Don Cannon, a protg. The police, 
working with the Recording Industry Association of America 
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/recording_industry_association_of_america/index.html?inline=nyt-org>, 
raided his office, at 147 Walker Street in Atlanta. The association 
makes no distinction between counterfeit CDs and unlicensed compilations 
like those that DJ Drama is known for. So the police confiscated 81,000 
discs, four vehicles, recording gear, and other assets that are 
proceeds of a pattern of illegal activity, said Chief Jeffrey C. Baker, 
from the Morrow, Ga., police department, which participated in the raid.

DJ Drama (whose real name is Tyree Simmons) and Mr. Cannon were each 
charged with a felony violation of Georgias Racketeering Influenced 
Corrupt Organization law(known as RICO) and held on $100,000 bond.

i wish this would have happened in the late 90's with DJ Clue.

it would have saved me many painful experiences where "Clue...clue...clue"
echoed through my head.

http://parties.vrillusions.com/gallery/2007-01-21-winterdelica

Was really doubtful if some of those would come out.  Also first shot
at trying to remove noise from a couple pictures.

The archetype always has been a cool little place, and it got deco'd
out like crazy for this.  All the DJ's were great.  Which was nice
since the only one on the lineup that I've heard play before is
Mubali.  I really liked Zyla's set (insanely dark), unfortunately
there were some sound issues with her set.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} RIAA guns for mixtape artists.

Talk about shooting yourself in the foot:

"Record companies usually portray the fight against piracy as a fight
for artists' rights, but this case complicates that argument: most of
DJ Drama's mixtapes begin with enthusiastic endorsements from the
artists themselves."

I hope this means the beginning of the end for this generation of
sub-par rap artists.

Rap in 2007 is akin to where rock was 20 years ago in the
mid-80's...desperately in need of a challenger...something to
rejuvinate and change the paradigm.

The moment "Yo! MTV Raps" became a cultural phenomenon in 1988, rock
started to change...it exploded in 1991 when Nirvana blew up and
changed the landscape again.

Subject: {pb-cle} Winterdelica Photos are up!

Well, this party was quite a challenge, photographically 
speaking.  It was VERY dark in here and lit only by blacklights.  So 
I needed to use the flash while still showing the blacklit ambience 
of everyone's great costumes and decorations.

I think i made it work, but most importantly I had a blast!  Luke had 
to start turning people away at the door because it had reached 
capacity and everyone there had a great time and the music was 
incredible as we've all come to expect from the Goahead events.

Enjoy!

Those photos came out great!  (How did we not realize you were there??)

About time did it reach capacity. We ended up leaving early-ish---but it was pretty packed then.

Yeah, they came out better than mine, although I guess having a speed  
of ISO 1000 [sic] is a good start :)

The picture of me is hillarious
http://www.silverraver.com/photos/Winterdelica/100_4567

I guess that's the key to not always looking mean in pictures, make  
some r tard face instead.  YAAAY, I LIKE GOA!!! YAAAAY!

I'm pretty hard to miss.  6' tall gnome-like character running around

You should see the ones of you that DIDN't make the cut.  yea, those

Yea, ISO 1000 and a $4k camera make a difference.  8 years of 
experience doesn't hurt either!

Oh, I AM a pompous snob aren't I.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

United & famzine.com present...

EXPANSION

Alan Oldham / T-1000 - (chicago / berlin)
The proud Detroit thoroughbred of heralded quality and consistency, 
recording appearances with names such as Woody McBride, Dave Clarke, The 
Advent, and Marco Passarani; all of whom have recorded in a variety of 
sonically-challenging genres all on one ambitious record label. In 
addition to his Stateside appearances on Pure Sonik, Oldham struck close 
alliances with Tresor Records. DJ T-1000`s "Jetset Lovelife" EP was the 
first fruit of this all-new cooperation. The follow-up debut on Tresor, 
exclusive work entitled "Progress" became a cult classic. Owner of his 
new record label "Xfive", DJ T-1000 has always consistently turned out 
the most flexible documents to his personality. Whether DJ'ing worldwide 
or within his own productions, this fearless operator truly encompasses 
all that is "Electronica".

Bryan Zentz / Barada - (pdx)
Bryan is set to be at the forefront of the next wave of DJ / Producers. 
His DJ skills and live P.A.'s have to be witnessed first hand and the 
labels for which he has recorded for read like a Who's Who of techno 
music: from early output as Barada on Richie Hawtin's Definitive label, 
Dave Angel's Rotation, Felix Da Housecat's Clashbackk, slamming techno 
on mega-labels Primate & Jericho, dark electro as Bryan Never on 
Electrix, and many more. He has also recently completed a full length 
album for Carl Cox's label Intec. In 2004 Bryan started his own record 
label "Disruptor". Recent activity includes remixes of "My Life With The 
Thrill Kill Kult" with Ken Ishii, a mix CD on Germany's label Monoid, 
and upcoming singles on Gourmet and Intec Recordings.

HIGH TECH SOUL is the first documentary to tackle the deep roots of 
techno music alongside the cultural history of Detroit, its birthplace. 
>From the race riots of 1967 to the underground party scene of the late 
1980s, Detroit's economic downturn didn't stop the invention of a new 
kind of music that brought international attention to its producers and 
their hometown.

Featuring in-depth interviews with many of the world's best exponents of 
the artform, High Tech Soul focuses on the creators of the genre -- Juan 
Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson -- and looks at the 
relationships and personal struggles behind the music. Artists like 
Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Eddie Fowlkes and a host of 
others explain why techno, with its abrasive tones and resonating 
basslines, could not have come from anywhere but Detroit.

With classic anthems such as Rhythim Is Rhythim's "Strings of Life" and 
Inner City's "Good Life," High Tech Soul celebrates the pioneers, the 
promoters and the city that spawned a global phenomenon.

The film features: Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Eddie 
(Flashin) Fowlkes, Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, John Acquaviva, Carl Cox, 
Carl Craig, Blake Baxter, Stacey Pullen, Thomas Barnett, Matthew Dear, 
Anthony "Shake" Shakir, Keith Tucker, Delano Smith, Mike Archer, Derrick 
Thompson, Mike Clark, Alan Oldham, Laura Gavoor, Himawari, Scan 7, Kenny 
Larkin, Stacey "Hotwax" Hale, Claus Bachor, Electrifying Mojo, Niko 
Marks, Barbara Deyo, Dan Sordyl, Sam Valenti, Ron Murphy, George Baker, 
and Kwame Kilpatrick.

The film's soundtrack includes: Aux 88, Cybotron, Inner City, Juan 
Atkins, Mayday, Model 500, Plastikman, Rhythim Is Rhythim, and more. 


"Bredow's cast of alumni -- the holy trinity of Atkins, May & Saunderson 
at the front -- fill out this tale with passion, pride and, oddly for 
music of the future, nostalgia too."
- Dazed and Confused
 

"An enjoyable education into the music, the city and the main players 
past, present and future."
-DJ Magazine
 

"Defines the myths and the magic of Detroit techno from its beginnings 
right up to how it has evolved to become High Tech Soul."
-Derrick May
 

Location: Cleveland

Tek-know? will be hosting a screening of the movie High Tech Soul to be 
followed by another night of Tek-Know madness.


They will also have Gary Bredow, the film's writer, director, and 
producer, in for a Q & A session after the screening.<br>

Alan Oldham (T-1000)

One of Detroit's most talented and venerated techno mixers, DJ T-1000 
has been instrumental in the Motor City scene as a label-head and 
producer as well as DJ. Born Alan Oldham, he spent time as a 
graphic-design specialist and comics illustrator while studying media at 
Detroit's Wayne State University. Hired by Derrick May to illustrate the 
sleeves on a few Transmat releases, Oldham became interested in 
Detroit's electronic scene, and gradually transformed his Fast Forward 
radio program on WDET from industrial and fusion into techno. During the 
show's run, from 1987 to 1992, Oldham introduced thousands of area 
listeners to Detroit techno via productions from May, Kevin Saunderson, 
Juan Atkins, Underground Resistance, and Carl Craig . as well as other 
techno figures like Joey Beltram, Moby, 808 State, and LFO. The show 
ended in 1992 when an offer to tour with Underground Resistance as the 
replacement DJ for Jeff Mills proved too difficult to resist. Also in 
1992, he formed his own Generator label, the origin of seminal releases 
by Oldham projects like X-313 ("Interferon," "World Sonik Domination") 
and TXC-1 as well as tracks by Dave Clarke and Woody McBride. In 1996, 
Oldham closed Generator and opened a new label, Pure Sonik. He also 
began DJing around the world, gaining a reputation as one of the best 
Detroit DJs among considerable competition. The DJ T-1000 mix albums 
Supercollider (a Generator label retrospective) and Live Sabotage: Live 
in Belgium displayed his mixing genius, while his debut production 
full-length, Progress, appeared on Tresor in 1999. Oldham also began 
recording another album, for Astralwerks. In addition, he has recorded 
for Djax-Up-Beats, Matrix, and Communique, and done remix work for Terry 
Lee Brown, Jr. and the Punisher.

Info:

Giveaways:
There will be giveaways throughout the night, including CDs and
glowsticks. Be sure to get there early to get them while they last.

Recordings:
The entire night will be photographed (by Sarah Asti of GSP) and
recorded on camera (by Jerrod Mercer and company), so be sure to act
and look your best for the cameras! In addition, both stages will be
recorded and the recordings will be available online for download
after the party.

Nourishment:
There will be reasonably priced snacks and drinks for sale for your
enjoyment. There also will be very light refreshments available for
free, as well as a drinking fountain for hydration. WBGU, Total Street
Knowledge, and other organizations/businesses will have booths setup
selling merchandise and spreading knowledge of what they do.

Benefit:
This event is a benefit for both WBGU (WBGUfm.com) and UCF. Though
there is no door charge, we encourage you to bring a few dollars to
donate to the cause of an underground college radio station and a
haven for positivity. Both of these organizations are underfunded and
struggle to survive to provide their unique and rare services to the
community.

Venue:

UCF:
The event will take place at UCF, a "Community and Spiritual
Development Center". UCF is a "shelter" that has an amazing aura of
respect and understanding. There is a lounge upstairs, a roomier
basement downstairs, and a tiny chill room for quiet and relaxation.
There are bathrooms and a drinking fountain inside the venue with easy
access. There will be areas provided outside specifically for smoking.

Saturday, March 24th, 2007
D.P.S. (DETROIT PARANORMAL SOCIETY) also known as..... Local 313 presents....

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

i picked up the Behringer BCD-2000, and i'm still futzing with it.

Sort-of....
If the hardware is sending reliable data, it's then up to the host
program to do something with that information. There's a propensity
for communication errors and a bit of latency, sure, but it all
depends on what you want to do with it.

Problem I'm having now with the BCD-2000 is that the pitch control
isn't sending incremental data when you move it....sometimes the pitch
jumps +.1, sometimes +.3, sometimes up to +.4. I'm working on tweaking
the XML mapping doc. to get the "scratch wheel" more precise, but it's
only as good as the hardware...which, in true Behringer fashion, is
decent, but not amazing.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Interesting NAMM things

im tend to agree with adam....you only get 127 steps per cc to use....there 
is no way its gonna ever be smooth like a tech or decent cdj when you are 
pitch shifting or trying to scratch...they need to come up with a better way 
to do it...but dont ask me how.

"they need to come up with a better way to do it...but dont ask me how."-
nick.s

They have.  Its called OSC or OpenSound Control.  Its a high resolution
control protocol.  Its actually a networking protocol. On the hardware end
the lemur multitouch control surface and the monome both utilize OSC.
Software...Max/MSP, Reaktor, CSOUND, Pure Data, SuperCollider, Traktor,
Bidule, and a few others allow the use of OSC.
