Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM ASSUMING ALL
*** LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS, YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED
*** WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org

	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT ON THE WEB AT
HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND
THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO
ANYONE WHO CAN USE A SEARCH ENGINE.  I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE
OR OTHERWISE.


okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 5 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,

includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} it's all over

   For some time I've thought the fate of techno would parallel that of
disco. Never really thought of the political/cultural parallel, but I
like it. 
   I think the country is definitely more conservative than liberal
right now. The overwhelming tide of nationalism/patriotism that has
swept over the majority of the american populace is being instigated by
a conservative administration and the lap-dog mainstream media.
   I went to a movie the other day (first time in a long time) and they
actually inserted the catch phrases "In God We Trust...United We Stand"
on the screen in big white letters on an all black background,
repeatedly, during the pre-movie trivia crap. That seems like some
rather Orwellian indoctrination to me.
   "In God We Trust" - what god? in a predominantly christian society,
most people, who may identify themselves as christians or as coming
from christian backgrounds, will think of the Christian idea of God.
They may even, at some level, be strengthened in their christian
identity and become more aware of the christian/islamic division that
is being used in this campaign of conquest.
   "United We Stand" - it's the whole "you're either with us, or
against us" thing from bush's speech. It calls for unity, it doesn't
specify within what limits, it suggests total unity, which would make
alternative views and debate impossible.
   Anyhow, when's the last time we had patriotic messages on the movie
screens, and has anyone else noticed the large number of hollywood
films glorifying the U.S. military since 9-11?
   I'm not going to get into the next election. There's still 2 years.
If the current trend continues, he'll be re-elected. If something
changes, he could be ousted.

   Anyway, I'm drifting off topic. That's the beginning of my evidence
for the conservatism of the U.S. right now.

   SO...Yes, I believe the parallel is there. Techno will continue to
be sucked into the mainstream. And perhaps it will, like Disco and most
"fads", be rejected within a couple/few years.
   I see some evidence for this rejection begining allready. My friends
who listen to rock or hip-hop are becoming increasingly negative
towards techno. This could be the seed for the rejection. The social
influence of the rock and hip-hop scenes could eventually force this
invading genre out of popularity, if the dislike for techno at the
consumer level spreads and is communicated to the music industry
through album sales and radio requests (or lack thereof)
   I hope so.
   Techno, edm, whatever you want to label the broad genre, I hope it
"dies". I firmly believe that total rejection by the mainstream culture
is necesary to force the evolutionary stream of electronic music back
"underground" where it can morph and move, free from the comercial
profiteering formulae that bind it now.  

   anyhow, that's my 2 cents.

if i had more than 3.5 hours of sleep, right now id rattle off a list of a
few hundred electronic music artists that exist today that youve never
fucking heard of. to claim that commercial profiteering controls dance music
either means that you totally ignore huge portions of the music, or you just
dont know what youre talking about. personally, id love to hear some kit
clayton on B-94. ya'll need to quit worrying about manstream and underground
and just go listen to some good fucking timeless music.

I guess I should have rephrased.  There is a remix that "Ruff" Ryder did =
that I picked up that is more of a medley of 'Joy' and 'We Do It Ruff'.  =

  look, im not a purist most times, but a song that good shouldnt be

  Tom is right.  Yes thats right I said it.  There is so much more going on in electronic music than most of you can even fathom.  Electronic music never stopped progressing.  But the progression of the dance "rave" scene has declined.  While electronic music continues to move forward the majority of the "scene" is completely nieve to this progression and has continued to embrace what the media perceives as electronic music.  
  
But yeah like Tom said just go out and find good music.  Listen to what makes you happy but always know there is so much more out there.  Its almost impossible to keep up with all the good stuff coming out nowadays.  During your searches of course you will come along allot of pretentious crap but you just have to keep looking cause something out there is bound to please you.

i agree with both jeremy and tom, the old underground is no longer 
underground, hence the bitching about mainstream etc...the rules changed and 
most ppl didn't even notice.  there is SO much good quality underground 
electronic music, i can't even keep up and i try hard to stay informed.

check out grooves mag, a great resource for cutting edge electronic music of 
all genre's:
http://groovesmag.com/

and igloo mag:
http://www.igloomag.com/

good places to start.

im confused though, at the end of this article, it says traditional radio
stations dont pay performance royalties because they have proven promotional
value. i could swear that those station have to pay ascap and bmi or
whatever theyre called for each time a song is played. i might be on crack
though.

Subject: {pb-cle} the hives.  garage rock.  blah  

yeah, they sound just like the strokes and the white stripes and every other 
no wave lo-fi garage rock band that is popping up all over everywhere.  
steady yourself, kiddies.  garage rock is the new pop-punk.  it has been 
around for a long time, but now be prepared for it to infiltrate your radio 
and become annoyingly infectious.  it's been absolutely blowing up college 
radio for the past two years, and it's totally hit it's high point on that 
medium, and it's about to spill over into the mainstream.  my advice?  buy 
all of the out of print vinyl at the hives show, wait two more years, and 
then sell it on ebay to finance your second home in the hamptons.  oh, and 
one more thing, you're going to want to bring earplugs.  the hives have a 
notoriously loud live show, and get there early to see the mooney 
suzuki...they kick ass.  daniel.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} web radio protest

it probably has to do with the payola system thats currently in place, the
labels pay money to do all sorts of promotional stuff and give most stations
free music that says "for promotional use only".

the record labels do not even fundamentally understand the internet.  i've
talked to these 2 people that worked for one of the labels locally.  they
were pretty in tune with what was going on in the scene but the people they
answered to were just suits and really had no clue other than basic
accounting and whatnot, they crunched numbers and came up with really dumb
ideas.   their jobs were basically to "convince" radio stations to play
various music...

Yeah, I thought they did too.  Something like 5 cents a song or 
whatever.  I know that college radio doesn't pay anything, but 
that's because they're non-profit.

im confused though, at the end of this article, it says 
traditional radio
stations dont pay performance royalties because they have proven 
promotional
value. i could swear that those station have to pay ascap and bmi 
or
whatever theyre called for each time a song is played. i might be

though.

i'm pretty sure traditional radio stations don't have to pay a cent to play
their music as long as it's one of those promotional copies the record
company sends them.

the record company is telling them what to play anyhow. why would they have
to pay when they're being told what to play? and i know this is going on...
where do you think the "autographed guitar to the 5th caller!!" is coming
from?? you think the radio station bought that guitar? no, it was delivered
to them with a piece of paper that said "play a certain song X amount of
times".

they have to pay the RIAA for each time they play a song
but they make it up in advertising revenue

does anyone own the copyright to classical music?
what about blues and folk songs
does the copyright expire after a period of time

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} what is musical copyright

noone owns the copyrights to the actual music, but modern recordings are
protected....   say the trout soup orchestra records mozarts ala turka, we'd
have the copyright on our rendition/recording, but no claims on the actual
piece.....

copyrights used to expire after 14 years or something, but disneys assfuck
lawyers buy politicians every now and again to extend the copyrights so they
can keep their disney archive safe.....   gotta love disney, regurgitating
the same movies over and over.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/clbevents.htm

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Cinco De Mayo
 05/04/02
 Washington, DC
SYMPTY AND GHM PROUDLY PRESENT 
CINCO DE MAYO 
SATURDAY MAY 4TH. 2002 


We humbly step into our Nation''s Capitol to do our first ever DC event!!! We 
are very excited to be here and feel honored to be accepted with such loving 
arms. Teaming with GHM, one of DC''s "up-n-coming" production companies, this 
night plans to be a truly unique event. From the line-up, to production, to 
the surprises to be discovered at the party, "Cinco de Mayo" is a completely 
fresh, new & exciting party that will bring together some of the best of the 
North East area and the DC area under one roof! 


TECHNO ROOM - hosted by Sympty Productions 



Chris Liberator 
(Stay Up Forever, London UK) 
***First Ever DC Appearance*** ***2 Hr. Set*** 
Chris is a long time friend and featured artist at Sympty parties; he is part 
of our family. Chris is one of the 3 Liberator DJ''s, whose Stay Up Forever, 
Cluster and 4x4 record labels form the backbone of the London underground 
techno scene, whilst his DJ''ing takes him to the four corners of the earth! 
It''s a rare moment when Chris can be found in the country without a gig to 
play, a track to remix or a record review to write for Wax Magazine or 
Update. It''s this dedication to the music and the club/free party scene that 
he helped create, that has found him being placed in the Top 50 of DJ 
Magazine''s poll of the best DJ''s in the world. He also records under a huge 
range of pseudonyms (on his own & with other producers such as D.A.V.E. The 
Drummer, DDR, Paul Harding & Guy McAffer) including Halo, Creeper, Cosmic 
Trigger & Star Power (to name but a few) & was also responsible for the 
massive acid techno anthem ''London Acid City'' as Lochi with Lawrie Immersion. 
His studio output can also be found in the present and back catalog of every 
other self respecting label in the genre including Solid, Prolekult, Noom, 
Boscaland and Eukatech such is the demand for his high standard of work, & 
his production includes everything from hard acid & techno through to funky 
house & trance. 



Function 
(Sympty / Infrastructure / Synewave / Downwards, NYC) ***Live PA*** 
We are proud to announce our newest addition to the Sympty Family. Function 
has been involved in the NY techno scene for many years. Beginning as a DJ 
in NYC, it was not long before Dave tried his hands at producing. Since that 
time, Function has developed as one of the most respected and recognized 
techno producers/DJs on the East Coast. With releases on techno''s 
prestigious labels Synewave & Downwards (which also hosts other techno giants 
such as Regis, Damon Wild, Advent, Joe Mull, etc.) Function was able to take 
his acclaim to new heights as he opened his own record label Infrastructure 
in the 1990''s. Aside from performing, Function is also known for his widely 
popular "Tresor" parties at the Limelight where he introduced NYC to 
performers such as Jeff Mills, Oliver Ho, Surgeon, etc. Still producing, 
performing, and spinning all over the globe Function''s dedication to the true 
techno sound has found him both respect and admiration from within the 
industry. Tonight, he comes to educate our Nation''s Capitol to educate us on 
the sound that started this whole thing - pure, driving, sick, techno! 



Jevic and DJ Pauly 
(Sympty Productions / www.sympty.com, NYC/NJ) ***CD 
Release - "SYMPTIFIED"*** 
Jevic exploded onto the scene during the late 90''s. Since that time, Jevic 
has maintained his reputation as one of the most skilled and professional DJs 
in the North East. Technically, his skills are world-class; there are very 
few that DJs that can produce tighter mixed sets. Add this to a track 
selection that always produces an incredible amount of "train spotters" and 
you have the formula that has made Jevic such a success. Truly a pure talent, 
Jevic''s sets have frequently garnered the praise of "best set of the night". 
Humble and quiet Jevic always lets his music do the talking and what a loud 
statement it makes! Aside from DJ''ing, DJ Jevic is the second main component 
behind Sympty Productions. Teaming with DJ Pauly over 4 years ago, he sits at 
the right side of the helm overlooking multiple business aspects integral to 
the success of the company. Silent and focused, Jevic''s responsibilities and 
contributions can often go unnoticed to the untrained eye. Yet, that is the 
way he prefers to do things. DJ Pauly is one of the most recognized people in 
the scene. Recently adding a new dimension to his popularity, DJ Pauly has 
quickly become one of the most booked DJs in the North East. Playing a 
diverse range of sounds from Hard Progressive Trance to Techno to UK Hard 
House. Aside from DJ''ing, DJ Pauly is the founder and main component behind 
Sympty Productions. Building the Sympty brand from scratch... DJ Pauly has 
dedicated himself to providing the most memorable events in recent history. 
Direct and intense, DJ Pauly''s has earned an impeccable reputation that 
always proceeds him. Truly a "larger than life figure" in the North East''s 
scene it is very rare to find someone that has not been touched by this man''s 
contributions. DJ Pauly has developed into a formidable presence within the 
DJ community. With nothing to stop their powerful climb to the top, Jevic & 
DJ Pauly continue to build their following through hand raising sets that set 
the dance floors jumping!

(Sympty / Hard to Swallow / Park Rave Madness / Natas, Philadelphia)

manager of 611 record''s vintage vinyl shop in Philly, a member of Rob Gee''s

renowned DJ playing coast to coast. The godfather of the Philly hardcore 
scene will drop some old school smart bombs on your brain. 



Mindbender 
(Sympty, Philadelphia) 
Mike''s diverse musical style sets him a side from most DJs. His musical 
selection ranges from 150 BPM, high-energy acid trance to uplifting 
progressive trance. His mixing style consists of smooth transitions where the 
tracks seamlessly blend together. Mike''s enthusiasm and energy behind the 
decks is projected onto the audience during every performance. 



Matt Ward 
(GHM Productions, DC) 
Matt Ward, founder of Washington D.C.''s GHM Productions, has been perfecting 
his own blend of hard funky house and funky break-beats for the last three 
years. Whether he''s dropping house or dropping breaks on a crowd, he''s sure 
to stir up the funk. 



Justin Smith 
(GHM Productions, DC) 
Justin Smith brings his unique blend of tribal and funky house to the 
forefront in DC. With his sharp cuts and clean mixes, Justin never fails to 
hype the crowd. Almost always in the mix, he produces a creative collage of 
pure house music. Be on the lookout for free copies of his new CD, "Give Me 
the Music" at this party. 


JUNGLE ROOM - hosted by GHM 

Stakka and Skynet 
(Underfire Recordings / www.stakka-skynet.com, UK) 
Creating a sound that could be dubbed as post millennium, Brighton based drum 
n bass artists Stakka and Skynet, over the last few years, have fully emerged 
as two of the hottest producers on the drum n bass scene. Tracing their ro 
ots, the Brighton crew began their musical careers in 1994, producing and 
remixing tracks with labels such as Ram/Liftin Spirit, and working with such 
legendary drum n bass masters as Andy C. Living in Brighton, far away from 
the London scene, has allowed Stakka and Skynet to interpret drum n bass from 
a different perspective, helping them to manipulate and twist their sound 
into a unique style of futuristic sci fi drum n bass, that has become their 
trademark. Stakka and Skynet joined forces in 1997, to create a genius that 
has become the mastermind behind the creation of the drum n bass labels known 
as Audio Blueprint and Underfire. Influenced heavily by science fiction 
films, their music has taken on a very visual feel. With the intention of 
expressing a strong mood, they break the mold by creating a story that takes 
the listener on a journey through a barrage of strange tech noises, 
manipulated basses, and solid beats. Their recent release of the Clockwork 
LP has been the topic of discussion among drum and bass fans worldwide. Be 
prepared for a wicked set of forthcoming tracks, high intensity, and deep 
emotions! 



Kemal 
(Cryptic Audio Recordings, Glasgow UK) 
Kemal, half of the infamous Kemal and Rob Data aka Konflict duo, will be 
coming in from the United Kingdom to play some serious drum and bass for the 
DC massive. Drawing on his early love of acid and Detroit techno, Kemal 
found that mixing it up with Rob''s hardcore-breakbeat roots has proven to be 
the essential element in the development of their astoundingly unique sound. 
With their unreleased bits continually being hammered on dubplates by the 
world''s most prominent djs, and their constant touring schedule, Kemal and 
Rob still find time to drop anthemic releases and remixes on a wide variety 
of labels from Audio Blueprint to Timeless and now their own imprint 
Negative. Under the alias Konflict, Kemal and Rob released "Messiah" on 
Renegade Hardware''s Aftermath LP. The opening track from Dieselboy''s "6ixth 
Sense" album, this anthem is one of the most recognizable tunes in drum and 
bass, destroying dance floors around the world. 



Myster Mason 
(Local 13 / Gasm Recordings / GHM, Philadelphia) 
One of Philadelphia''s most respected djs/producers, Myster Mason always comes 
cross with a fierce blend of self produced drum and bass tracks, and those of 
other Gasm artists. Never a disappointment, Mason will once again show DC 
what''s up. Check out www.mystermason.com to hear his forthcoming releases. 



Deinfamous and 


Tittsworth (The Syndicate / Netwerk || 5" Taint / www.tittsworth.com , DC) 
Linking up for a special tag team set, Deinfamous and Tittsworth are two of 
DC''s most beloved drum and bass artists. Expect to hear a hard hitting blend 
of the hottest drum and bass out, in addition to a few forthcoming bits and 
original tunes. Combining the forces of The Syndicate and 5" Taint, this 
will surely be a set to remember! 



Caz 
(Sympty / GHM, DC) 
Caz combines the dark and technical side of drum and bass with his own unique 
brand of scratching. With his new CD, INTROSPECTION, and countless 
performances up and down the East Coast, Caz always comes correct. Go to 
www.djcaz.com for Caz''s mixes, schedule, and info. 



Bobby Jae 
(GHM / District Soul / Antidote, DC) 
Bobby Jae''s unique style of deep, groovy drum n bass has made him a favorite 
in the east coast jungle scene. As a pioneer of the soul-revival sound, he 
brings forth an incredible audio experience not to be missed. Be prepared to 
take a journey into the funkier, more organic sounds of drum n bass! 



Akasha and Ricky Ricardo 
(The Syndrome, Abyss, NF:eckt, Baltimore) 
Hailing from the Baltimore area, these two djs have been representing the 
Baltimore drum & bass scene with their biweekly drum & bass event, Syntax. 



MC Armanni 
(Ill Skillz / Gasm Recordings, Philadelphia) 
Considered one of the USA''s best MC''s, Armanni is in constant demand by 
promoters and artists alike. Often in request by UK artists during American 
shows, he has established a strong presence in the drum and bass community 
here. Armanni will be making sure DC stays hype all night long!

Sat May 04                   WISHING ON A STAR 2                     Dayton

Wishing On A Star 2
Dayton, Ohio
May 4th, 2002

"Celebrating our music, our lives, and our freedom"

Sandra Collins(Kinetic Records, CREAM, Florida)
Sandra will be making her first Dayton appearance in a long time and will 
be setting you free with a beautiful set of mind-blowing trance. She is so 
amazing and flawless and will leave you wanting more, and more, and more. 
Her latest cd, Cream, has sold thousands worldwide and is definitely one 
not to pass up at your local Media Play.

Total Science(Metalheadz, CIA, UK) Making one of only 8 total stops in the 
US and their only Midwest appearance in 2002, that's right Paul and Quiff 
better known as Spinback and Q Project will be in Dayton on my birthday to 
lay down dubs and white labels to no end. These guys are the hottest drum 
and bass producers on the planet right now and if you miss them you need 
to be examined. With over 12 years of experience these guys will 
definitely throw down the newest, most innovative shit, and it is mostly 
theirs'.

Dj Brisk w/ Mc Jumper(Next Generation Records, UK)
Ranked 82 (DJ Mag 1999 Poll) Paul ‘Brisk’ Smith has been DJing for over 15 
years starting with local residencies in his home town of Southampton, 
England and progressing through the ranks landing more prestigious gigs 
and appearances as time went by. 1992 saw him take on the role of in house 
musical consultant and main resident at the now legendary Club Kinetic, 
Stoke On Trent where he performed every week alongside such luminaries as 
Carl Cox, Sven Vath, Westbam and numerous headliners. This lead to playing 
at all the major dance events across the UK putting him firmly on the map 
for years to come. This will be his only Midwest appearance in 2002 so 
make sure you are there to catch this legend.

Andy Hughes(MAFDDAP, Bliss, Balance Promote Group, Orlando)
Since leaving his post as a highly awarded and promoted electrical 
engineer for the Kennedy Space Center (yep - that one!), Andy fast became 
known as a consistent DJ who would throw down a thumping yet varied set 
suited to the moment and to the crowd's needs. He has been surrounded by 
music for 36 years and his sets definitely show it. His progressive house 
and breaks mixes make you do nothing more than dance your ass off. He 
hasn't played around here in awhile so make sure you are here for his set 
as he sets Sandra up to take us into outer space.

Titonton Duvante(Residual, 7th City, Palette, www.wellknowndjs.com, 
Columbus)techno live p.a. w/Ian Jessee(Violin)Charleston, WV and Dawn 
Weber(Flugelhorn)St. Louis
If you have not had the chance to catch the well known live p.a. from 
Titonton Duvante you have to make it out on this awesome night. He has two 
very talented artists coming to throw some music on top of this already 
dope set. He will also be throwing down an hour of drum and bass on the 
one's and two's for all your dnb fans.

Kid Entropy(Semiconscious Media, Canvas, Well Known, Chicago) vs 
Ariel(Prophecy, Well Known, Cincinnati) vs Voigt-Kampff-live 
p.a.(Zeropoint Records, Well Known, Cincinnati)w/ Mc Kwest-On
That's right 4 decks, 2 mixers, some keyboards and beat machines and there 
ya go. These 5 drum and bass gurus will be ripping it for an hour and a 
half, dropping new track after new track making you happy to the new 
innovative sounds.

Flagrant(Isaiah Clothing, Mattic Records, Mustard Records, 
www.wellknowndjs.com, www.hip-hop.com.au, Australia)
This hip hop turntablist will be making a special trip from "the land down 
under" to rip it on the wheels of steel. He finished 4th in the DMC's in 
Australia and is about to make a name for himself in the states.

Tommie Gunn(Boom, WWW.NETWERKONE.COM, Joy Resident, Tampa)This tech house 
master will be making the trip up from Tampa for his first ever Ohio 
appearance to rip it up just like he did in New England for many years. If 
you have yet to hear his mix cd SCREAM you need to, it's dope. Hopefully 
Mr. Gunn will bring some to give out!!!!

Dj Booth(www.natefx.com, www.djbooth.org, www.wellknowndjs.com,UFO 
Clothing, Kansas City)
This speed garage/funky house maniac will be bringing his raver girlie 
following and will be on his Rock The Cock tour. On of his latest tracks, 
Up To You, has been remixed by Robbie Hardkiss and will be debuted at this 
year's Winter Music Conference. What party isn't complete without a DJ 
Booth, and the UFO clothing he will be bringing to throw out.

Vixen(LateNight, Outer Limits, www.wellknowndjs.com, Nashville)
This trance goddess has blown it up at past Wishing Well events and after 
leaving the crowd with tears at Wishing 1 she is ready to tear them down 
again. Show some love for a girl making a name for trance in Nashvegas.

2x4 Nautigroove vs Digital Psykosis(In the Groove, Cincinnati)Two of the 
best trance djs in the Midwest are coming together on this awesome night 
to lay down the nicest, most beautiful set. Their flawless mixing and 
crowd pleasing tracks have made them what they both are today.

2x4 Shiva vs React(Subterror, Subsonik, Indy)(Subsonik, Silent Corperati, 
Cincinnati)Randy and Shiva are bringing the heat just like they do at 
every event they perform at. What is different you ask on this night, they 
are coming with the ruckus together on four decks, hell yeah.

Matt Freeman(Buckwyld, Flashpoint, Jomama, Dayton)
This house mechanic has been one of the strong points in the Dayton scene 
for some time now. His sets are full of enthusiasm and dope tracks. He 
rocked it at the last Wishing On a Star and this will be no different.

Urbane vs Vibe Raider(Wishing Well, www.wellknowndjs.com, Wisconsin)
This drum and bass, hardcore, hip-hop tandem has been slowly tearing up 
the Midwest with their dope track selection and overall great 
performances. These girls work off of each other so well to give you a 
mind-blowing experience. 

Bobby Bedlam(Wishing Well, Ideal Muzik, Sarasota)
Bobby is slowly making a name for himself in the Midwest with his funky 
ass breaks and his scratching ability that just adds something extra to 
every set. Being in Florida it is very hard for us to get him up here as 
much as we want so let's cherish every minute of it.

The Drunken Deathmatch
Nostalgic(Floorgasm, Dayton) vs D8A(Buckwyld, GrooveReactor, Dayton)2x4
These two crowd rockers will be coming together to rock it double fisted 
on four decks, imagine that. You never know what they will pull out as 
this will be their first appearance together ever.

Ali Obvious(Bounce Theory, Dayton)
Dana will be making his first appearance for Wishing Well and a long 
awaited one at that. This guy has been rocking decks for years and we are 
proud to let him come rock it for us. 

Kid Chaos(Mythodic, Planet Nine, Columbus)
This funky house technician has molded himself after the likes of Donald 
Glaude and Bad Boy Bill and has now been rocking decks and floors since 
95'. His mix of funky and bangin house make him an Ohio favorite.

Cyberspeed aka Todd Allan(Wishing Well, Cincinnati)
This dj has been there a lot longer than most of us and got his first 
experience of the music in Detroit when he found his first rave. Now his 
blend of progressive house and breaks is moving people all around Ohio. 
Give some love to the man that never stops.

Jam Deuce(Glowin-A-Fuse, DPM, Columbus)
This Columbus native has a lot of energy on the decks, be it scratching, 
or just doing crazy tricks, he always tears it up. Be sure to catch this 
set because you never know what he will pull out of his magic bag.

Clay-Born(Wishing Well, Louisville)
Making his last appearance of 2002, give this man some love. Clay is just 
starting to rock it and now has come across some problems with hearing 
loss. After undergoing some operations let's hope to have him back rocking 
with those filthy dirty breaks sets he was starting to be known for. Make 
sure to check him out in Columbus at Smoke em Toke em also.

Cameo(Wishing Well, Cincinnati)
You want two-step, that is just what Matty will give ya. He rocks the drum 
and bass almost every Tuesday night at Gravity Bass but on nights like 
this he can't hold back the basslines that two-step produces.

Tease(In-The-Groove, Cincinnati)
This young trance prodigy is becoming a household name in Ohio with his 
bangin' sets you can hear almost every weekend. Show some love for the 
newest member of In the Groove.

Christopher Owens(Glowin Family, www.glowin-a-fuse.com)
Christopher can rock it any way you want but on this night he will be 
bringing the hard house just how you like it, smooth and silky. 

Ben Davidson(In-The-Groove, Cincinnati)
This newcomer to the Ohio scene is starting to make a name with his tribal 
house sets that will leave you in awe. Awesome track selection and 
flawless mixing will speak for itself when he has thrown down his last 
record of the night.

Ben West(Wishing Well, Cincinnati)
Ben plays some of the best tribal anything and he will be accompanying his 
set with his drums. This will start off the day and there shouldn't be any 
reason you are not at this event when he goes on.



Outdoor Chill Area 8pm-4am

Mowgli(Sweat Sessions, CBS, Wishing Well, Cincinnati)
Ria will be playing a nice set of intelligent on the outside to chill you 
down and get under your skin. The music he plays is righteous, and his 
experience shows through every set.

SKL(Spiritual Krack Laboratory)
Featuring, strange.loop, tig, theChef, MarkyMark, and Lou Rawls. This all 
night extravaganza of ambient, idm, experimental, and punk rock music will 
have you jammin. These guys are celebrating 10 years of making the scene a 
little weirder.

Foursqare(Za's Pizza, Metronomix, Louisville)
The Lady Foursqare made noise at both Chix with Dex and Stargazing. People 
are starting to love what she throws down. Whether it is idm, two-step, or

This is an event celebrating our awesome local talent- who needs a big 
headliner anyways? Back when I started partying (though it's not THAT long 
ago) kids like jedi & guru blew away any national/international talent 
booked for the event. Speaking of, I tried to book jedi & guru, but due to 
certain circumstances beyond my control, I couldn't book em.

You know to expect the only the raunchy best from Northern Virginia’s 
Syndicate crew.  Their tag-team patio sets are traditionally one of the 
stand-out nights of the summer season.  Expect outrageous behavior, 
boorish men, lewd women and of course excellent music, with styles ranging 
from house to drum ‘n’ bass to neo-electro to breaks to techno.  On top of 
it all, it’s Sinestro’s birthday — longstanding ringleader of the 
Syndicate.  Make sure to spank him silly.  And from Luxx in NY it’s the DC 
debut of Linus, “The World’s ‘Worst’ Rapper.” Some things have to be heard 
to be believed...

5" Taint is an established crew in the greater Washington, DC area.  5" 
Taint was founded by Jason Plank (nooch) and Timothy Hilke with a mindset 
that they would support most genres of Electronic Music (House, Techno, 2 
Step, D'N'B, and UK Hard House are currently supported).   5" Taint held 
one of the most successful weekday weekly parties in the metro area last 
year and helped organize and present "United We Stand 2001" (along with 
4Twenty4 and Stellar), a charity event whose proceeds went to the Red 
Cross to help the victims of the September 11th attack on America.  On 
their plate this year they have two weeklies:  one a Tuesday night party 
in Sterling, and the other, a Saturday night weekly named Stereo which 
begins Saturday, June 22nd.  For more information on 5" Taint check out

Buckwyld Entertainment presents...
PHREAKY DEAKY 2
Saturday, June 1, 2002
SW Ohio
Buckwyld One Year Anniversary!!

Founded in May 2001 by DJ D8A, Buckwyld Entertainment has expanded to
include Matt Freeman and JJ Boogie. Our goal is to bring you nothing but
top-of-the-line events with national and international artists from
around the world. 

DJ IRENE : UC Music : SHR Group : Los Angeles, CA : Americas #1 female DJ
and her first performance in Dayton - this is a special stop on her
Global House Diva 2 Live from Ibiza North American tour. Irene is a World
Class DJ/Producer who has left her mark at clubs and parties the world
over. This is a limited 30 city tour so be sure to see it while you can!
www.DJIRENE.net. HARD HOUSE

WOODY MCBRIDE : Communique : Wall of Bass : Minneapolis, MN : One of the
founders of the scene and quite frankly one of the people responsible for
us being able to have a show like we have planned tonight, Woody has been
and continues to be one of the most respected and sought after techno
artists. From his early classic tracks such as "Basketball Heroes" and
"Comedy Tragedy" to his works today - which included work on the
soundtrack for Ralph Nader's Presidential Campaign, Woody continues to be
one of the techno's brightest stars. www.djesp.com. TECHNO AND ACID HOUSE

PAUL BIRKEN : Tone Wrecker : Catalyst : Minneapolis, MN : LIVE P.A. Paul
is an International techno hero, as if you didn't know by now. Starting
with his acidic Son of Gonzo releases in the mid-90's, up to the
launching of his own label, Birken has always worked his ass off to get
people groovin. His records on Communique (that's Woody McBride's label)
have sold out here and in Europe and it's our pleasure to bring you one
of the world's finest dj/producers. www.ToneWrecker.com TECHNO/LIVE PA

DJ DRAGON : N'Telligence Recordings : Denver, CO : Well our buddy Dragon
tore it up so much at Phreaky Deaky 1, we just had to bring him back.
He's played shows out west with DJS like Micro, Frankie Bones, Oakenfold
and many more. A blended mix of hard and epic trance not to be missed -
shaken not stirred. www.DJ-DRAGON.com EPIC TRANCE

MEGHAN vs. MS RED : Goahead Productions : Cleveland, OH : Get ready for a
super tec-house tag-team between two Cleveland all-stars on the decks. A
pounding hour and a half taking you higher. 2x4 TEC HOUSE TAG TEAM

DJ NOSTALGIC : Downtown Entertainment : sundayLIVE : Dayton, OH : Roger
is one of our area's top DJS and is a funky disco house master of the
highest degree. Get ready for the funky-mix-master. FUNKY DISCO HOUSE

MATT FREEMAN : Flashpoint : Buckwyld : Dayton, OH : This DJ/producer has
been banging tracks out since before many of us had ever heard our first
electronica track. Back from his recent tour of Australia with Paul
Birken, Matt always pleases with his head-bobbing sounds. HARD HOUSE

ALI OBVIOUS : Bounce Theory : Dayton, OH : Dana has been at the forefront
of the Ohio drum and bass and jungle movement from the beginning. He's
teamed with Bounce Theory to bring some of the best events ever to the
Midwest and will be bringing a full crate of the sickest beats around.
DRUM AND BASS

JJ BOOGIE : Groove Reactor Records : Buckwyld : www.groovereactor.com :
Cincinnati, OH : Owner of Groove Reactor and this is a support stop for
his first vinyl release - The Slipstream E.P., you can expect nothing but
the hardest hitting trance and house from this veteran. HARD TRANCE AND
HOUSE

DJ D8A : Buckwyld : Groove Reactor Records : www.groovereactor.com :

Fri Jun 07                SHIMON & ANDY C @ groove               Pittsburgh

Friday June 7th 2002
Pittsburgh PA

Red Tape Productions Presents


SHIMON & ANDY C.
   Live @ Groove


Featuring:

ANDY C.     Ram Records, Liftin Spirits, Uk

The Chiefs in charge of the entire Ram Operation are, as you should know 
by now, none other than Andy C. and Ant Miles.  Ram Records kicked off in 
early ’92 with Andy’s now highly collectable “Sour Mash” EP. Around this 
time, Ant was expecting his first child, forcing Andy to go solo on such 
singles as “Bass Logic” and “Elevation” in ’93. Once Ant got back in the 
studio, the bond known as “Origin Unknown” blew up with the classic EP 
“Valley of the Shadows”. RAM Records reputation only grew, especially 
after the track won Best Hardcore Tune at the 1993 Hardcore Dance Awards; 
as well Andy received the award for ‘Best Newcomer). In ’94 and ’95, work 
came thick and fast for Origin Unknown with tracks like “Truly One” and 
“Cool Down”. Threw various alias’, the duo released timepiece tunes such 
as “Beyond Bass” and “Here and Now”. Around this time, Andy hooked up with 
Randall to create “the Sound Control” 12”.  Andy also found himself DJing 
at major bashes such as Innovation, Desire, Dreamscape and Jungle Fever. 
Around ’96, Andy hooked up with Shimon to create “Quest” and “Nightflight” 
that took their names to greater acclaim.  1997 marked a new Era in Ram 
history as Andy C. & Shimon’s tracks “Recharge” and “Quest VIP” hit 
worldwide markets, bringing them the award for ‘Best Album’ at the 1996 
Hardcore Dance Awards; Andy received ‘Best Producer’.  In 1998, the birth 
of Ram Trilogy marked three classic EP’s, with this Andy went on to host 
London’s Kiss FM as well as performing at Ram Sessions at the End, 
Movement, Helter Skelter, Metalheadz, Warning, One Nation and other 
locations all around the world, bringing him the Status as ‘Best Dj’ at 
the 1999 Knowledge Awards.  



SHIMON  Ram Records, Liftin Spirits, Uk

You cannot mention the name Shimon without the images of his long time 
compatriots, Andy C and Ant Miles, instantly filtering into the same 
picture. Although the outline of Shimon is often blurred by the notoriety 
of his Ram Trilogy clique, he remains one of the primary colours of the 
Ram Records rainbow, and is very much an individual. Certain DJ's and 
producers within our scene have attained celebrity-like statuses through 
their outstanding and revolutionary work. Due to this it becomes 
increasingly difficult not to herald them on the lofty platform from which 
their achievements derive, and harder to converse with them on a level 
that does not smack of inferiority. Talking to Shimon helps to ignite the 
set stereotypes that have evolved from the upper tier of drum and bass; 
quashing any preconceived notions of a fixed social hierarchy in an 
instant. Requesting an interview from him can be paralleled to asking any 
one of the smiley faced, enthusiastic junglists you associate with your 
typical rave for a bottle of water; such is the honesty and enthusiasm of 
his reply.



MC GQ        Emcee Recordings, UK

MC GQ has been a figurehead and spokesman for the scene for years. 
Originally GQ was most known as the voice of the legendary AWOL, at the 
Paradise Club. Since then he has evolved in stature, becoming quite 
possibly, the most well respected and requested MC in his field.
Through the years he's broadened his horizons, venturing world wide, 
representing and promoting the cause. With a view to the future, he is 
currently establishing his record label 'Emcee Recordings', which is 
striving to encompass the entire spectrum of Drum 'n' Bass. 
Randall, Andy, Hype, Bailey - they all make him work differently. He tries 
to switch his style to read the music, "All the DJ's give you different 
energy". To GQ the inspiration comes from everywhere, It would be 
impossible to narrow it down to any particular source. Music inspires 
everyone, so listen and understand...

Subject: {pb-cle} CLEVELAND:  Scott Henry - Saturday @ Spy

For those who don't know...

This Saturday, May 4th,

The Spy Bar presents....

SCOTT HENRY

Doors open @ 9pm for ages 21+

Open DJ Doug Burkhart

Deep House in the basement courtesy of Mike Metz

Cover charge, I'm guessing, is $10.

Spy is located...
1261 West 6th Street - Downtown Cleveland - 216.621.7907
http://www.spycleveland.com/

Parking is $5-$10, so take that into consideration.


Also, comming on May 25th,  DJ Lego from Chicago.  With
Urbanic and Chad DownBeat in the basement

this evening for a seriously good time with house music.


Have a good weekend....

Doug Burkhart

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Warning - KLEZ.H variant (apology)

yep, I got 4 emails with various attachments that were all filtered 
by norton and they are all that klez virus.  Here's the list of 
attachments that I had that contained the virus:

class.scr
17live[1].exe
image34[1].pif
carro_pratagl[1].exe

and they all were around 80-90 kb in size.  Tried to get more 
information on them without luck.  O well.

Subject: {pb-cle} ADMINISTRATIVE VIRUS WARNING..... (re: blake)

okay.....

i know virus alerts are against the rules, but this isn't one of the bullshit
ones that people sometimes pass around.....

anyhow that klez virus is hitting pretty hard, the newest variant the klez.h
is claiming to be a fix for the klez.e virus.....

the short of it is that it sends itself with a spoofed email address and i
found out that someone just got one sent from pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org...

THIS IS NOT SENT BY ME OR THE LIST, it is a forged address.

alot of people don't know they have this one, since people are alot of the
time replying to a bogus address.   if i were you, i'd get a virus scanner or
use the online one at http://housecall.antivirus.com/ at the very least....

infos @
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.h@mm.html
and
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.e@mm.html

please i beg of the general population TO USE FUCKING VIRUS SCANNERS.  our
firewall at work blocked some 500 klez virus emails this week.
i get 3-4 a day at this address......

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} what is musical copyright


Actually, a lot of times the orchestra has to pay for the rights to perform 
a piece of music.  I don't they would ever have to pay for something that's 
a century or two old, but there's a lot of contemporary orchestral music out 
there.  The orchestra I played in during high school managed to get rights 
pretty easily, since we were a youth orchestra and we were also attached to 
the Columbus Symphony.. But I'm fairly certain we needed to get the rights 
to play Libby Larson, Adolphus (??) Hailstork, I think possibly even for 
Shostakovich.  We were certainly using music purchased from publishers, and 
not Xerox copies.

Choirs have to buy one copy of the music for each member of the group in 
order to perform a piece, too.  I think there's a lot of rules pertaining to 
legally performing music written by other people.. but I can't claim to know 
exactly what they are.

of course, we could also have "The Pink Parade" or the "Rainbow Rave" with 
an all gay lineup -- but that's likely already been done (although probably 
not intentionally)

I think Tevie already reported on an all-Asian lineup in Columbs.

I've seen many many all-white lineups, just no one has the stupidity to =
advertise it like that, much like no one would advertise the Country =
Music Awards as "all-white".

Or the Acadamy Awards for decades.

I don't see a difference between this and the Soul-Train Awards, or =
B.E.T.

well most raves today are all-male, all-white lineups.

when i go to local raves, the demographic homogeneity is striking. (white,
middle class, 15-19 yo, heterosexual.)

even in pittsburgh, it didn't used to be like that.

i think it's a good idea.

out-of-print sheet music or certain editions are really expensive. it's
common for choirs and symphonies to rent it from other choirs and
symphonies. 

the mendelssohn choir and the pittsburgh symphony orchestra performed
mozart's requiem last weekend. we used scores stamped with "property of
minneapolis symphony orchestra"

performing and recording new renditions of classic tunes is common in jazz.
i don't think you have to pay for that right, you just have to acknowledge
the authors/composers.

tooting my horn: yesterday we got back from nyc. we performed at carnegie
hall. heinz hall is better. but there are not many pittsburgh hotels better
than the parker-meridien :) european tour will rock hard.

It's going on again this year, gonna be like the pb-cle all stars summer
hang out party.

I am 5 days away from signing a contract for my new job, so I'll have more
money than I thought for the party.

Free Food
Free Beverage

21+ event with exceptions only made for those people that I know will be
responsible

Let me know if you plan on coming.  It's steaks, brats, chicken breast,
dogs, burgers, etc.  Last year I ate flesh every night for about 2 weeks
following the event, I don't want to have left over food again.  So far I
know myself and Tom Cox are spinning, cause soniq is a bitch and is spinning
in portland that night.  Let me know if you want to spin, and let me know
that you are coming.  

If you don't know, this is a free event, my event that I throw to give back
to the scene and allow for people to enjoy good music and a great social
atmosphere.  Email me privately with any questions and/or reservations.

of course, we could also have "The Pink Parade" or the "Rainbow 
Rave" with 
an all gay lineup -- but that's likely already been done (although 
probably 
not intentionally)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} what is musical copyright


I can't remember which piece it was.. maybe Mahler 1st symphony.. But we had 
to make all these corrections to our parts, because the people that 
published it had ripped their copy off another publisher.. and then 
intentionally thrown in misprints so it would look like thay hadn't stolen 
it.

Or at least, that's the story our conductor told us as he went through and 
listed all the changes. :)

Hahaha, Erik and I went to that Asian Night down there once, only we
didn't know *going in* that it was Asian night ... we were a little

I think all female events are pretty neat though.

Something like all black party is just kinda beyond the point though. Im not
going against it, but I just dont like the idea of where that could be
heading.  I dunno

It's segregation... Noone would intentionally throw a party with all
white dj's and call it "White Out." That was my whole point in the last
post... It's obviously a dumb white kid throwing this... 

I wonder if they'll have separate drinking fountains for the black djs
too?

wow, for once i actually agree with brian. thats amazing. this weeks of
exploitation. THATS why im pretty fucking irritated about it. and its called
fucking PITCH BLACK. jesus christ. are they gonna have a fucking al jolson
cover band? whew. obviously i have no problem whatsoever with a lineup of
all black deejays, especially considering how many of my favorite deejays
are black compared to how many are white. but to try and exploit it like
this to sell to silly shite suburban raver kids is so totally offensive to
me.

I have a 1.6A doing 2.5 right as we speak, with stock intel cooling.  The
temps are tad high (52C), but I am buying a water/peltier cooling setup next
week, soooo....

The northwood chips are AMAZING OCer's!!!  Especially with my motherboard,
epox 4dba2+, it can lock the PCI/AGP bus to 33/66, while taking the fsb to
rediculous levels...

some asian dudes hit above 4 Ghz with these chips, that is above a 100%
increase!!!

your stupid if you buy that shit from those guys, trust me....


1.) good luck not getting ripped off
2.) good luck finding something decent
3.) you can destroy their prices if you bought on the net
4.) Those vendors are the SHADIEST people I have seen in a while (not all,
but most)

Go abit, Asus is over priced.   But you should look at Epox, MSI, or
Gigabyte.   Make sure you get the VIA kt266a or 333 chipsets.  DON"T get an
AMD chipset.

Don't buy your RAM thier, all they have is crap.  You want Crucial, or
Corsair.  Samsung 2700 is really good too....

Get the slot load Pioneer DVD player.  I believe it is the only 66 Mhz
player out there

what you should be paying:

130 mobo
230 for a 2100+XP
300 for 1 gig DDR (heard they went down this week though, check out
crucial.com)
150 for a plexwriter
60 for the DVD
rack case, good question, they range all over....

don't forget a 80gig 120GXP IBM deskstar...

just buy your shit from newegg.com.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} computer show today at the ix center in cleveland

the computer show is for little kids trying to get porn, and cheap video
games. I used to think it was the shit when i was 14 but then i got ripped
off many times over. save your time and the 5-10 they charge you to get in.
Btw is there still the guy their selling the "over 1000 games" cd rom there
where all he did was went crazy on download.com in the shareware game
section?

Russians computer vendors are shady as fuck, if i ever see AtoZ computer guy
anywhere i'm going to put my size 10 boot right up his ass.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} computer show today at the ix center in cleveland

i use an audigy and live 5.1

the audigy is for sonar only, i let windows use the 5.1 for beeps and bells
and crap and turn that channel on my mixer off when i'm playing with the
audio.

now the recording/ playback quality is okay for me, but other people seem to
hate 'em so YMMV.

the audigy is 65$ OEM w/o the drive, the 5.1 is 35$ OEM w/o the drive.  i
don't see boxed versions of them at the shows.  expect to pay around 150-200$
for them with the drive.  there is the extigy that is a USB version of the
audigy but doesn't have ASIO driver support.

some of the pro grade cards are getting pretty cheap, but still expect to pay
200$+ for the bottom end of those...

i use the audigy because i mostly need the midi port and don't use the audio
on it for music so much and when i do it's buried in a mix enough that the
quality is just fine.

again, YMMV.

as for computer shows, i love buying off russians and greeks!!!
living on the edge!  um, yeah.

I remember getting the original Quake, euro version a couple weeks before it 
came out in america for like 30 bucks at one of those computer shows...  I 
was pumped, got a different looking cd and a box too.

Boy am I cool. pfft.

Subject: {pb-cle} George Acosta Slammed The Red Zone!!!!!!!



If you missed George Acosta last night at the Red Zone you missed
a hellified set. GEORGE slammed so serious shit last night.
I can't wait for JOSH WINK for CLOCKWORK Sunday. Track after track
pure exctasy......

I usually don't dance becuase dj's have a hard time keeping the flow after 3 
songs but George produced 1.5 hours of serious track pounding last night. He 
spun longer then that but he got on a tear at one point.

Well I'm looking forward to JOSH WINK at the Red Zone for Memorial Day.

OUT!

Subject: {pb-cle} anyone in the market for these items??

some things I am willing to dump, some I fear my life to sell (like the
tables), but I am sooooooo busy right now, that these things are just taking
up space, and I can buy them again in the future, and I need $$ to get my
business off the ground, plus some "domestic" things ;-]

I have:
          a korg electribe drum
          a korg electribe synth
          1 technics 1200 (possible, if the price is right)
           2 technics 1200MK2's (possible, if the price is
           right, just paid trouty 100 bux to fix one)
          a older Dell 17" PC monitor
          a older Sampo Alphascan GL 19" semi-
          widescreen monitor.
          like 3 486 PC's
          2 MTX AAL 830 speakers
          a HP Officejet LX printer/Fax
          Samsung M301 DVD player (NICE!!)
          a pool table ;-]  (not totally joking here, but it is a
          very expensive slate table, that needs professional
          movers)

let me know if any of these peak an interest, and if you have the loot for a
reasonable offer, sorry, no "IOU" type stuff.

And remember, if you need a PC, I am the man!!

Yes, the sound was excellent. But the music was just lame. The whole night
before Bailey had went on, im thinking to myself,..  I hate raves, I hate
raves, I hate raves...
I was cranky anyways due to being up 24 hours to make this last minute drive
down there.
Thanks to the man himself, he had to replace Total Science because they
cancelled, but it was well worth it...  Hopefully next time Ill get the call
in advance and not so last minute.

>about 2:50 bailey came in...jessie introduced him to mr dea and myself(i
feel >special)....mr bailey stepped to the dex about 3am...oh gosh 1 1/2

Yes, Id have to say he did lay it doooown. Alot of new Dillinja. He knows
what i think about the Thugged out Bitch track, so when he played it i just
laughed at him. =P
The crowd was definatly screaming for the rewinds, it was actually kinda
nice to hear the crowd screaming it, and not an MC. For the most part, I was
impressed.

>anyways....jessie got the deadline vip from bailey on dub...NICE ONE...so

Man,..  I didnt even expect him to do that, and I really didnt want him to
just give it away like that either. He did it in front of everyone, and i
got the look like "who the hell are you!"..  His words "Dont complain.. just
take it"..     what could i say.  ugh.
Im just glad he's awsome enough to send me the Carlito - Just Wanna Be.. in
the mail.
I definatly would scope out this track if you are a Carlito/Dj Addiction
fan.

>anyways....after the party is said n done me and mr dea find jessie and
bailey in my >car...basically we end up at bailey's room...bailey is spittin
his game to jessie, she >werent having it and we dip....leaving bailey
drunk, half passed out, and probably with >blue balls...

Yes, we went to the car to put the plates in there, I didnt want to walk
around all night with it either. We chatted for some time.  He's real layed
back, thats what i like about him too. He doesnt have that "IM Bailey from
Metalheadz" attitude.
Spittin game.. heh...   I wasnt having it due to the amount of respect i
had. What can i say? Although the man is fine...    atleast I tucked his
booty into his bed before i left.
Not to mention when I came home he had all ready called 2 times....    I
needed to sleep.
I was talking retard mode most of the time, so i had to jus call him back
later anyways.

I didnt leave the man with blue balls, he did that to himself.  :P

All and all, I had a fabulous time, even though I hate Dayton with a
passion. (Sorry Soniq =P)..  This one defintaly goes down in my books for
the time being.

Im tired and have to work at 5am..  ugh.

Ez

weak. the hardest possible metroid reference for a deejay name was that
boston guy Justin Bailey. anything else is weak. though "Mother Brain" would
be a dope porn name for a chick.

I am sure no one really gives a rats ass, so I will keep this short and 
sweet. I spend too much time reading list mail, even though I learn a lot 
from it. I am unsubbing to free up some time. If anyone wants to get hold of 
me you know how to do it. Thanks for the drama!

If you REALLY think The Hives sound just like The Strokes, you're either 
listening to the wrong music, or you've become too entrenched in electronic 
music to tell the difference.

I have been searching for someone by the name of Hiram Abiff. If anyone 
knows who this man is, please hit me up.

Ben

I'm not at home, so I can't check and make sure, but I think I have that.. 
is it a jungle remix?

If so, I got in a 2 record set that also has "The Way 2K" and a remix of 
Horns2000.. and some other track, can't remember what it is.

Got it in Boston. :)

  Yes, the sound was excellent. But the music was just lame. The whole =

  I was cranky anyways due to being up 24 hours to make this last minute =

  Thanks to the man himself, he had to replace Total Science because =

  Yes, Id have to say he did lay it doooown. Alot of new Dillinja. He =
knows
  what i think about the Thugged out Bitch track, so when he played it i =
just
  laughed at him. =3DP
  The crowd was definatly screaming for the rewinds, it was actually =
kinda
  nice to hear the crowd screaming it, and not an MC. For the most part, =
I was
  impressed.

  >anyways....jessie got the deadline vip from bailey on dub...NICE =

  Man,..  I didnt even expect him to do that, and I really didnt want =
him to
  just give it away like that either. He did it in front of everyone, =
and i
  got the look like "who the hell are you!"..  His words "Dont =
complain.. just
  take it"..     what could i say.  ugh.
  Im just glad he's awsome enough to send me the Carlito - Just Wanna =

  I definatly would scope out this track if you are a Carlito/Dj =

  Yes, we went to the car to put the plates in there, I didnt want to =
walk
  around all night with it either. We chatted for some time.  He's real =
layed

  Not to mention when I came home he had all ready called 2 times....    =
I

  I was talking retard mode most of the time, so i had to jus call him =
back

  I didnt leave the man with blue balls, he did that to himself.  :P

the best dance music version of that track was wookie's "whats going on?"
12". he's producing the new Soul II Soul LP, and his garage label was put

wow, for once i actually agree with brian. thats amazing. this weeks of
exploitation. THATS why im pretty fucking irritated about it. and its called
fucking PITCH BLACK. jesus christ. are they gonna have a fucking al jolson
cover band? whew. obviously i have no problem whatsoever with a lineup of
all black deejays, especially considering how many of my favorite deejays
are black compared to how many are white. but to try and exploit it like
this to sell to silly shite suburban raver kids is so totally offensive to
me.

because im feeling way too much shit to make only 10. these are the mad
early summertime jams:

1. Mundo + Jade - "Come to Me" - White
2. PD Syndicate - "Ruff Like Me" - London Republic
3. DJ Narrows - "Dreams" - Resurrection White
4. Vincent J. Alvis - "Show Me the Way (United Grooves Remix)" - Public
Demand
5. So Solid + Beenie Man - "Reality Check" - So Solid White
6. ????? - "Wanting Me Tonight (Wookie Remix)" - White
7. Tubby T - "Tales of the Hood" - Social Circles
8. Lorraine Cato - "Did It" - Social Circles White
9. The Surgery - "More Weed" - Social Circles
10. Mundo + Lifted MC - "Broadcast" - White
11. Seal - "Crazy (Marconi Brothers Remix)" - Marconi Brothers
12. Darqwan - "Friday at the Limit" - Texture
13. Stush - "Dollar Sign" - Social Circles
14. Fyrus - "Mission 5" - Social Circles
15. Qualifide - "Holding On" - Qualifide White
16. Heartless Crew - "Superglue" - East/West

i really love the social circles camp right now. all the different emcees,
and they all have such distinctive sounds, and then with sticky's
production, i get this vision of them all as pirates of bass or something.
but im on crack.

Ah yes, the Rollerdome.

 The Rollerdome, and the Gym Club.  A small club called 'One 8 Up' is =
fast becoming a third.

For those in the Dayton/Cincy/Columbus area, FYI, I will be spinning at =
a free weekly in Dayton's Oregon District at the Nite Owl.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} demf - hotels

I just reserved my room, priceline is not happening, period, I was bidding
like 130, and still got rejected.  The Marriott Renascence [sp?] had 2 rooms
for me last night at like 10PM (Sunday), 179 plus tax.  They could not get 2
double beds, only one king, and **maybe** a roll away for each room (I got 2
rooms).  $15 a night for parking.  One thing I recommend, is getting the
rooms for both friday and teusday.  It's pricey, but the hassle you save in
trying to make a camp during the day on moday is huge!!  Checking in on
friday is way better too...

OK, now hold on a second, lets give you some stats:

my car, the anal probe, has been in its exact configuration (or lack of) in 
shitty parts of: Toronto, Washington DC, Chicago, not to mention cleveland, 
akron, canton, indianapolis, philly, youngstown, and NEVER had ANY problems 
for 4, yes count them little boy, 4 years, (i understand that this is 
longer than you've been driving,) but I put 120,000 grief free miles on 
that car and it gets broken into in a private parking lot in friendship (at 
3 on sunday afternoon) and then on a public street only blocks away 12 
hours later.

NOT to mention the third time near PITT.

Fuck you, pittsburgh, and all the low expectation having motherfuckers 
living here

Brian

PS, i know enough to not be stupid with my sound system like the pencil 
dicks that have big "Alpine" stickers on their windows blasting distorted 
gangsta rap.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} looking for apartment

I know exactly where he lived - the end of Friendship towards the PJ's.
His car was yes, in a private lot. I trust my car more on a well-viewed
street,
than in a lot behind an apt. building, where nobody can witness it getting
gaffled.

I will say though, Brian is the first one I have heard ever having probs in
Friendship.
I know lots of peeps that live there and they love it.
I would also agree with Lawrenceville....not a real pretty hood, but cheap
as
hell, and close to downtown and highway access.

Lots of safe places  within the city. One place to mosdef avoid, is
Shadyside.
WAY over-priced, ,and I know a couple people who not only had their ride
fucked with,  but their APARTMENT broken into, on a SUNDAY AFTERNOON!

Of all the places I have lived here, I would recommend Squirrel Hill the
most.
Find a decent roomie or two,  and get a nice townhouse. You will stay well
within
that budget, and live in one of the youngest, most ethnicly diverse, and
accessable
neighborhoods in the city.

Now about that "Fuck you, ,Pittsburgh" comment....I would just like you to
know,
that I personally take offense to this. I am pretty sure I know this isn't
how you really
meant to come off... Please don't insult the entire populace of out home,
because
some fucking dopers gaffled your whip. Generalizations are bad m'kay?

Brian - hit me up on my home phone....

Good luck Blake,

it was 90$...  that was for my area on the 3rd floor, the downstairs rooms
were 100$ a month on the 2nd floor, i think the whole apt on the 1st floor
was 250.....

i got lucky that the landlord wouldn't make me pick up the slack on the empty
rooms on the 2nd floor!!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} looking for apartment

funny, i was just arguing with zone about how much
more safe it was to live in friendship than
wilkenhood. i didnt want to leave my car infront of
his house while we went to cleve for that party two
weeks ago cause i was afraid of it gettin jacked.

now, after reading this shit about friendship and what
not, i just realized that one week after my ex (we
were dating at the time) moved in on s.pacific we went
over to her place after flytrap one early saturday
morning. i had brought all my gear in from my car so i
wouldnt get jacked. i put it in the dining room, like
a dumbass, in view from the windows, cause she lived
on the first floor. anyway..... i was woken up at 7am
by our neighbor, who happened to be the boyfriend of a
girl that my girl worked with, and he told me that he
had been up all night "waching tv" when he heard our
window open. he looked down at our window, and saw
some smack junkie halfway in it. thats when he grabbed
his shotgun, pointed it out at him, cocked it and told
the dude he had 3 seconds to get the fuck out of
there.

thats living proof of the biggest downside of a
drunken coma.

youre not safe anywhere 'roun here. guess you just
gotta deal with it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} looking for apartment

First off, I don't live in Wilkenhood...it's edge-a-da-hood.
4 years living in the same house...never a single problem.
(unless you count the time some guy asked Ted while walking
home "hey white boy, ain't you afraid to be walking thru here at night?")
LOL!

My car has never been messed with,  or my house...ever.

Hell, the cops over here even pulled up one day when I
was standing in front of my house, to harass me about my
inspection sticker. They know what cars belong on what
streets here, and if they see an odd one,  they run the plates.
It used to bug me out,  and yeah, it's a little overbearing,
but it sure beats worrying about my shit getting gaffled by
some crack head.

I know I sure as hell have never had a fuckin' dopehead try
to climb in my window! Holy Shit Dave!

The biggest criminals around here are the cops - now under
federal investigation for the second time since I have lived here,
for racism and corruption...go figure. Last time, the chief of police was
indicted.

haha... that's probably because you live 2 blocks away from the 
edgewood po-po station... criminals would be wise to stay away 
from there!

seriously though, the east end isn't a bad place to look for 
apartments. lots of places in the 'bad' neighborhoods in town 
aren't really that bad, but the rents are cheap because of their 
rep. i'd say check out the wilkinsburg/regent 
square/edgewood/swissvale area. i guess i'm biased cuz i live over 
there, but there are plenty of decent spots over in 
friendship/highland park as well... also try greenfield (if you're 
white :), sq. hill, point breeze, oakland...

Zone..

Dont you live by a Burger King, where some guy came in and started shooting
up the place?!?!  I could have swore when me and Craig came down last year,
that you were telling us a little story about that, and how there were
helicopters and what not surrounding  the area.    As I recall, I even think
that made the news here in Cleveland.

Subject: {pb-cle} bsp: cleaning out my closet

...so I recently revisited some of my tracks on mp3.com and felt compelled 
to share some of the more interesting ones with y'all before I take them off 
of the site. FOR THOSE WHO'VE NEVER HEARD MY EFFORTS...

CHECK THESE OUT BEFORE THEY'RE GONE!!!!

http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/2203/2203202.html
BURNIN UP- breakbeat with funky techno flavor and odd time switchups

http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/2203/2203109.html
NOW EAT- haha; uppity up drum n' bass with a few drills and porno samples. 
one of my favorites in terms of length and content

http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/2203/2203079.html
OLIVE HO- yeah, for those into mental techno the title has an obvious 
reference to you know who, but I couldn't help think of how simular it 
sounded to his style when I was making it!

http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/2203/2203060.html
SLOOMOOV- starts off with some Boards Of Canada-esque trip hop & moves into 
a trancey speedcore segment after you think the whole thing is a loop. 
pretty sweet

http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/2045/2045156.html
TITJAC- here's a melodic breakbeat that chugs along with some strange and 
totally unrelated samples jumping out along the way. created just to defy 
any sense of composure

http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/2009/2009326.html
KEEPIN IT REAL- one of my first attempts ever and obvious, but should hold 
your attention overall. I personally favor the 'junkyard' drum n' bass 
segment

http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/2045/2045146.html
PROUD- I took a sample of Bush's speech concerning sending troops to 
Afghanistan and mixed it with an organic breakbeat. yeah, i guess some 
things were just not meant to be.



enjoy.

In the city, try:
Greenfield, Squirrel Hill, North Oakland, Friendship, South Side, the east 
part of South Oakland.

Avoid:
Hill District, certain areas of the North Side, certain areas of South 
Oakland, Lawrenceville, Wilkinsburg,

Outside the city:
LOTS of stuff.  Cheaper.  More of a drive to anything.  Very much depends on 
what you're looking for.  I like Dormont, Carnegie, North Hills, 
Monroeville, Turtle Creek, South Hills, Robinson, Blawnox, Crafton, and a 
bunch more.

Most of the cheaper stuff in decent neighborhoods is in the vicinity of the 
University of Pittsburgh.  Might want to dig through pitt.edu and find where 
they list nearby landlords.

Where are you working, what do you like to do, how old are ya, and stuff 
like that?  It's easier to recommend specifics with that in mind.

This is all in my opinion, which is unbalanced, biased, and often wrong.  :)

Yeah, I think I was there that night. A whole bunch of shit happened - 
wasn't that the same night the stabbing occured?

Anyways, one week before that my windshield wipers got bent backwards while 
I was at laga... for no apparent reason. I was parked in that parking lot 
behind the Exxon too.

I sure hope they felt better after busting my wipers up... anger management 
people...

obviously you dont know enough to stop it from getting jacked. what probably

shite car with a soundsystem. and they had no fear of taking it from you at

greenfield is like the whitest fucking place. anyway, i know plenty of
people who live in very "hood" like neighborhoods and who have a ton of nice
stuff and have never worried about shit. from bloomfield to hazelwood,
wherever. i like point breeze, lawrenceville/bloomfield, and highland park
alot. i might be moving out of squirrel hill soon though : (     i love this
neighborhood.

watch out for friendship, you might get your car broken into if you have a

this is silly. i can feel you on the hill, and on central northside (whew,
thats one place even i dont really like to be around), but wilkindsurgh isnt
really all that bad. certain parts of it are run down, but other parts are
rather nice. lawrenceville is a wonderful neighborhood, though i once heard
this whiteass girl call someplace in it "the ghetto". i almost pissed myself
laughing. and i cant ever imagine anyone not being "safe" (whatever the hell
that means) anywhere in oakland. thats just a joke IMO.

have you ever been to those places? i work in dormont/mt lebanon and i would
rather kill myself than live with all those racist white fucks that populate
almost all those neighborhoods just just mentioned. turtle creek is more run
down than most of the city is, and its right next to the "hood" of
wilkinsburgh. i spent the first 20 years of my life living in the south
hills, and i wil NEVER voluntarily move there again. i guess if you like
white trash rednecks (im looking at you silverponytail) you might love it.

i dont know, in oakland you can pay through the nose for a not very nice
place. you gotta watch out down there, they try to gouge students any chance
they get.

?? Shit, I had no idea. Sorry about that...

I think I remember opening it, but I was using a Macintosh at work so I 
didn't think anything of it... but that was last weekend? Its hard to screen 
mails using a hotmail account...

I'm not exactly sure what the deal is, any site I can go to for a free 
cleanup?

thanks for the alert...

hasnt the northside shaped up at all recently? hell, i
know some people who live there in some AMAZING houses
and i thought that this neighborhood was on the up and
up..at least getting to that point. i guess it is
still taking a while to clean it up..or maybe im just
confused.

and for the hill, what a sad place to live..why the
fuck has this city totally neglected the area closest
to downtown?

MOMENTUM: SATURDAY MAY 11th @ THE SHADOW LOUNGE

PITTSBURGH, PA -- Element 5 presents episode 2 of
"MOMENTUM" on Saturday, May 11th, 2002 at The Shadow
Lounge in Pittsburgh, PA.  Poetic funk resonating from
wave-like transmissions of energy provide warm
vibrations for a unique night of live music. The night
will feature a smooth blend of performances by Shawn
Rudiman, Middle East, Cultivator, Christiane Leach,
Soy Sos, Light Fantastic, Jitesh Ensemble,
Technoir-Audio, and other guests.

"Momentum is about the intersection of people, ideas,
places and spaces," said Jwan Allen, co-founder of
Technoir-Audio, "and it's really represented in the
music. The last event went anywhere from funk to
hip-hop to house to poetry to techno to jazz to outer
space and it was all live and inspired by the moment."

"We're really excited about playing this Saturday,"
said Nathan Peck, member of the jazz-funk ensemble
Cultivator. "What's especially exciting is the element
of surprise that this night brings." 

"The energy from the last party really drove the music
played on stage in a way that trancendended time and
space," tells Christiane Leach, member of local band
Soma Mestizo.

Shawn Rudiman, local electronic musician and member of
the Technoir-Audio crew explains. "Our last event
seemed to take on a life of its own, as if 'The Force'
decended and took over. We were a diverse array of
musicians who were locked on a vibe that was beyond
us. I found it really spiritual, especially when we
found ourselves performing live house music with heavy
african percussion and chants of soul power. It was
like we were taking it back, but also up there - ya
know?" 

Element 5 was created by a local collective of
aspiring musicians, artists, and creative who began
Momentum as an intiative to help unlock the potential
energy of the local underground. "We've taken a lot of
inspiration from the many fine groups who've been
organizing really unique cultural events in the city,"
said Arnie Pannell, a volunteer for the Element 5
project. "Like the Bridgespotters' Midnight Expresso
Series or Ground Zero's Flux parties or the new Dark
Night Cabaret Series, we hope Momentum can make a
similar contribution to the local urban scene and
provide a real home-grown forum for people to
connect."

That connection is expressed by the many people who
have lent their support to the Element 5 project,
including groups such as Ground Zero, Sun Crumbs, WRCT
88.3 FM, Bridge Spotters, local independent DJ shops
[720 records, Hypervinyl, Milk Records], The Natural
Choice, Brewhouse, Quiet Storm, and 7th Movement.

Momentum will be taking place this Saturday, May 11th,
2002 at the Shadow Lounge. Doors open at 10pm, $6 at
the door. The Shadow Lounge is located at 5972 Baum
Blvd at the intersection of Baum and S. Highland in
the city of bridges [Pittsburgh, PA].

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} looking for apartment

Ive been to the Burgh a few times, but not enough times to say where is
better.
I know out of the places I have been, I was most interested in Mt
Washington.
Especially with some of the houses that have the bay view over Pittsburgh
itself.
Ive been to Shadey Side also, but wasnt as interested as I was with Mt
Washington.

Zone lives in the semi ghetto..   one side of the streets nice, and the
other is questionable, but I gotta say the little store around the corner
had some good subs. ;)

Im sure you've had it turned up at some point for someone shady to hear the 
damn thing. Ans it was probably the same person too that has done it 
everytime here in pittsburgh its almost like they know what kind of car you 
drive.
But seriously I don't think anybody has put an Alpine sticker on their back 
car window since the late 80's early 90's.
Thats so out of style not to mention cheesy.

Far be it for anyone to do anything out of style and cheesy to their =
car.

Like the guy I saw at a gas station who had the black SUV with chrome =
trim and tinted windows and the sticker on the back saying "Black =
Gotti".  Not to mention that the sticker was individual letters, all =
poorly spaced.  Gets out looking like the love child of a three way =
between Elvis, Mr. T, and Pootie Tang.   I bet he wonders why he gets =
pulled over all the time.

  Im sure you've had it turned up at some point for someone shady to =
hear the
  damn thing. Ans it was probably the same person too that has done it
  everytime here in pittsburgh its almost like they know what kind of =
car you
  drive.
  But seriously I don't think anybody has put an Alpine sticker on their =
back
  car window since the late 80's early 90's.
  Thats so out of style not to mention cheesy.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} looking for apartment

Allentown isn't as bad as it seems. I am there every night, and my car 
doesn't get messed with. Its a pretty ghetto neighborhood, not too bad,  but 
I get a lot of hellos on the street and people are outside quite a bit. Who 
these people are, are quesiotnable though.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} looking for apartment

I used to live on Tyalor Avenue, near the Mexican War Streets, and the house 
was really nice. There are a lot of old, nice homes there, but the 
neighborhood got progressively worse, and my dad eventually moved out due to 
gunshots, and now I've heard its pretty bad to be in the park at night.. 
which is pretty sad, I learned how to ride my bike down there.

They are planning on cleaning up a lot of it- I believe the hold up at the 
moment is getting rid of the Garden Theater. Yeah, I hang out there.

 I asked Adam the same thing last year at DEMF.  The DEMF people are trying to avoid any repeat performances.  But I noticed Juan Atkins is playing again this year.  This Adult / Daniel Wang show is gonna be great.   I think the best phrase to describe this show is "tottaly radical".  Im so excited...i just cant hide it!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} looking for apartment

Yes, but that was because one of the tenants decided to bring two strangers 
into the home. I'm not suggesting hanging out with any of the Allentown 
natives...but most don't seem to want to bother anyone. I see lots of 
handicaps and people who just can't afford better places. Though poor, 
possibly mentally handicapped dudes tend to get desperate.

           ...and I totally forgot about that, so I will change my view. 
Just glad my car hasn't been broken into, knock on wood...

So what's up with all these remakes of old tunes into house white labels?
Damn producers cant think of their own shit to make so we get all these
GREAT cheesy tracks... Some that I found today that I plan on picking up...

**All are 2002 White Labels**
Dee Lite - Groove is in the heart 
Michael Jackson - Billy Jean
Interactive - Forever Young 2002(Kosmonova White Label) (female sampling
original by rod stewart)
Starship - Nothin's gonna stop us
David Bowie - China Girl
Level 42 - Something about you
Michael Sembello - Maniac (from flashdance)
Zanzibar - Long Train Running
Bill Medley & Jennifer Warnes - Time of My Life (dirty dancing is what comes
to mind with me)
Chaka Khan - Feel for You

Plus there is a remake of Faithless - Insomnia Hard House style on white
label...

Hi there!  I was just wondering if there are any good fabric stores in the Pittsburgh area that I should check out.  I am looking for quality, durable materials, at the cheapest prices possible...of course. Also, I haven't really been to the burgh since all this crazy construction I have heard about started.  I will be coming to the burgh tomorrow morning from the North on 279 South bound heading to Penn Center (job interview)....anything I should know about traffic/detour wise?  Thanks!   Smile on...

the Ft Pitt tunnels outbound are closed, as is the Mon wharf between the
north side and 376 east. the detours that they have placed are totally
overbearing, theyre meant to keep traffic flowing a very specific way, and
it makes it totally undriveable at times. my mom used to have a 10 minute
drive home, and its up to over an hour. and shes NO WHERE NEAR where the
construction is going on.

bent crayon had some older environ stuff.  speaking of which, morgan geist
'into a separate space' on phono/environ is fawking gorgeous.  bent crayon
has a CRAZY backstock of techno and house.  you just need to have 10 hours
to sift through 4000 records.

Subject: {pb-cle} Breaks track id

I have a track id question:

Does anyone know the artist/name of the track on the Koma & Bones Nu Horizons vol.2 mix that has a woman singing "I'm all alone"?....There's also a sample of a guy saying, "You're afraid of us, you're afraid of change"...

I love it...such hard depth and a bomb ass beat...My copy of the mix is really poor sound-wise, so I'd like to get it on its own.  Any help would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
---Laura---

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/clbevents.htm

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat May 11                    LOCAL ANESTHETIC                   Cincinnati

This event is 18+ with valid I.D. It'll be held at Club Venus on Vine St. 
in Cincinnati. I will post directions soon...Admission is 8 dollaz- free 
admission to those with a birthday on may 11th! (thanky grlboogie for 
making the suggestion!) This party is gonna start early- like 8pm or so, 
cuz us old-timers start fallin asleep after 5am, hee hee!

This is an event celebrating our awesome local talent- who needs a big 
headliner anyways? Back when I started partying (though it's not THAT long 
ago) kids like jedi & guru blew away any national/international talent 
booked for the event. Speaking of, I tried to book jedi & guru, but due to 
certain circumstances beyond my control, I couldn't book em.

The lineup is complete! WOOHOO!

Ariel & Kwest-on-

Watch the area's favorite dnb/jungle act & mc rip it up like no others

like Bones, Funk, Hardware, Dieselboy, DB, Christopher Lawrence, and will 
be returning from his performance in Wisconsin where he opened up for 
Micro, Deep Dish, DJ Rap, and Humpty Vission.

Ali Obvious-
bounce theory...dayton
Long time member of the party scene, Ali can show you how it's done with 
some wicked Drum & Bass! Watch for his upcoming release "Motion1"- an 
emotional fusion of d&b.

Shaggy Love-
pimp-o-tron ind...love ent...groveport, usa
Yes that's right- superstar dj Shaggy Love will be droppin beats like 
panties on prom night- so all you little girlies bring a pen, cuz this 
pimp 
is taking dj hoe applications!

Headstrong-
subsonik...cincinnati
He's back! A very special treat for you guys! Headstong hasn't played many 
events in a while, so be sure to give him a warm welcome back as he blows 
your mind with a rare hiphop set!

Matt Freeman-
flashpoint...jomama...dayton
Work it into the early morning with some funky house- Matt Freeman style!

Vinny Bricks-

You know to expect the only the raunchy best from Northern Virginia’s 
Syndicate crew.  Their tag-team patio sets are traditionally one of the 
stand-out nights of the summer season.  Expect outrageous behavior, 
boorish men, lewd women and of course excellent music, with styles ranging 
from house to drum ‘n’ bass to neo-electro to breaks to techno.  On top of 
it all, it’s Sinestro’s birthday — longstanding ringleader of the 
Syndicate.  Make sure to spank him silly.  And from Luxx in NY it’s the DC 
debut of Linus, “The World’s ‘Worst’ Rapper.” Some things have to be heard 
to be believed...

5" Taint is an established crew in the greater Washington, DC area.  5" 
Taint was founded by Jason Plank (nooch) and Timothy Hilke with a mindset 
that they would support most genres of Electronic Music (House, Techno, 2 
Step, D'N'B, and UK Hard House are currently supported).   5" Taint held 
one of the most successful weekday weekly parties in the metro area last 
year and helped organize and present "United We Stand 2001" (along with 
4Twenty4 and Stellar), a charity event whose proceeds went to the Red 
Cross to help the victims of the September 11th attack on America.  On 
their plate this year they have two weeklies:  one a Tuesday night party 
in Sterling, and the other, a Saturday night weekly named Stereo which 
begins Saturday, June 22nd.  For more information on 5" Taint check out

top-of-the-line events with national and international artists from
around the world. 

DJ IRENE : UC Music : SHR Group : Los Angeles, CA : Americas #1 female DJ

founders of the scene and quite frankly one of the people responsible for
us being able to have a show like we have planned tonight, Woody has been
and continues to be one of the most respected and sought after techno
artists. From his early classic tracks such as "Basketball Heroes" and
"Comedy Tragedy" to his works today - which included work on the
soundtrack for Ralph Nader's Presidential Campaign, Woody continues to be
one of the techno's brightest stars. www.djesp.com. TECHNO AND ACID HOUSE

PAUL BIRKEN : Tone Wrecker : Catalyst : Minneapolis, MN : LIVE P.A. Paul
is an International techno hero, as if you didn't know by now. Starting
with his acidic Son of Gonzo releases in the mid-90's, up to the
launching of his own label, Birken has always worked his ass off to get
people groovin. His records on Communique (that's Woody McBride's label)
have sold out here and in Europe and it's our pleasure to bring you one
of the world's finest dj/producers. www.ToneWrecker.com TECHNO/LIVE PA

DJ DRAGON : N'Telligence Recordings : Denver, CO : Well our buddy Dragon
tore it up so much at Phreaky Deaky 1, we just had to bring him back.
He's played shows out west with DJS like Micro, Frankie Bones, Oakenfold
and many more. A blended mix of hard and epic trance not to be missed -
shaken not stirred. www.DJ-DRAGON.com EPIC TRANCE

super tec-house tag-team between two Cleveland all-stars on the decks. A
pounding hour and a half taking you higher. 2x4 TEC HOUSE TAG TEAM

DJ NOSTALGIC : Downtown Entertainment : sundayLIVE : Dayton, OH : Roger

Fri Jun 07                SHIMON & ANDY C @ groove               Pittsburgh

Friday June 7th 2002
Pittsburgh PA

Red Tape Productions Presents


SHIMON & ANDY C.
   Live @ Groove


Featuring:

ANDY C.     Ram Records, Liftin Spirits, Uk

The Chiefs in charge of the entire Ram Operation are, as you should know 
by now, none other than Andy C. and Ant Miles.  Ram Records kicked off in 
early ’92 with Andy’s now highly collectable “Sour Mash” EP. Around this 
time, Ant was expecting his first child, forcing Andy to go solo on such 
singles as “Bass Logic” and “Elevation” in ’93. Once Ant got back in the 
studio, the bond known as “Origin Unknown” blew up with the classic EP 
“Valley of the Shadows”. RAM Records reputation only grew, especially 
after the track won Best Hardcore Tune at the 1993 Hardcore Dance Awards; 
as well Andy received the award for ‘Best Newcomer). In ’94 and ’95, work 
came thick and fast for Origin Unknown with tracks like “Truly One” and 
“Cool Down”. Threw various alias’, the duo released timepiece tunes such 
as “Beyond Bass” and “Here and Now”. Around this time, Andy hooked up with 
Randall to create “the Sound Control” 12”.  Andy also found himself DJing 
at major bashes such as Innovation, Desire, Dreamscape and Jungle Fever. 
Around ’96, Andy hooked up with Shimon to create “Quest” and “Nightflight” 
that took their names to greater acclaim.  1997 marked a new Era in Ram 
history as Andy C. & Shimon’s tracks “Recharge” and “Quest VIP” hit 
worldwide markets, bringing them the award for ‘Best Album’ at the 1996 
Hardcore Dance Awards; Andy received ‘Best Producer’.  In 1998, the birth 
of Ram Trilogy marked three classic EP’s, with this Andy went on to host 
London’s Kiss FM as well as performing at Ram Sessions at the End, 
Movement, Helter Skelter, Metalheadz, Warning, One Nation and other 
locations all around the world, bringing him the Status as ‘Best Dj’ at 
the 1999 Knowledge Awards.  



SHIMON  Ram Records, Liftin Spirits, Uk

You cannot mention the name Shimon without the images of his long time 
compatriots, Andy C and Ant Miles, instantly filtering into the same 
picture. Although the outline of Shimon is often blurred by the notoriety 
of his Ram Trilogy clique, he remains one of the primary colours of the 
Ram Records rainbow, and is very much an individual. Certain DJ's and 
producers within our scene have attained celebrity-like statuses through 
their outstanding and revolutionary work. Due to this it becomes 
increasingly difficult not to herald them on the lofty platform from which 
their achievements derive, and harder to converse with them on a level 
that does not smack of inferiority. Talking to Shimon helps to ignite the 
set stereotypes that have evolved from the upper tier of drum and bass; 
quashing any preconceived notions of a fixed social hierarchy in an 
instant. Requesting an interview from him can be paralleled to asking any 
one of the smiley faced, enthusiastic junglists you associate with your 
typical rave for a bottle of water; such is the honesty and enthusiasm of 
his reply.



MC GQ        Emcee Recordings, UK

MC GQ has been a figurehead and spokesman for the scene for years. 
Originally GQ was most known as the voice of the legendary AWOL, at the 
Paradise Club. Since then he has evolved in stature, becoming quite 
possibly, the most well respected and requested MC in his field.
Through the years he's broadened his horizons, venturing world wide, 
representing and promoting the cause. With a view to the future, he is 
currently establishing his record label 'Emcee Recordings', which is 
striving to encompass the entire spectrum of Drum 'n' Bass. 
Randall, Andy, Hype, Bailey - they all make him work differently. He tries 
to switch his style to read the music, "All the DJ's give you different 
energy". To GQ the inspiration comes from everywhere, It would be 
impossible to narrow it down to any particular source. Music inspires 
everyone, so listen and understand...

the most great adventure !

(singing stops here)

now that i'm the proud owner of a ridiculous mp3 player//recorder :}   i've
been downloading ultravox, berlin and YAZ, with selected alphaville, abc and
bronski beat (not that there's much to select from here).

i ran across this bizarre remix of one of my favorite songs of all time -
sinead o'connor "i want your hands one me".  mc lyte was involved and it was
just too weird.

i think i'm going to wear my alison moyet t shirt this weekend.  miss kittin
may be it now, but nothing beats alison.

Subject: {pb-cle} pb-cle psychology

I found this list of 'listening blocks' in an article I read today and it totally reminded me of how the people on this list tend to communicate:

Go ahead, pick your favorites:  =)
---Laura---

"For the (significant) people in your life, which of the follwing listening blocks do you typically use?

-Comparing:  You're always trying to assess who is smarter, more competent, more emotionally healthy.

-Mind Reading: You're always trying to figure out what the other person is really thinking and feeling.

-Rehearsing:  You're rehearsing what to say next.

-Filtering: You listen to some things and not to others.

-Judging: Negative labels have enormous power.

-Dreaming: Something triggers a chain of private associations.

-Identifying: You take everything a persona tells you and refer it back to your own experience.

-Advising: You are the great problem-solver, ready with help and suggestions.

-Sparring: You are quick to "put down" or discount what the person is saying.

-Being Right: You will go to any lengths to be right.

-Derailing: You change the subject when you get bored or uncomfortable.

-Placating:  You agree with everything to avoid conflict and be nice, pleasant, and supporting."

Subject: {pb-cle} No More Bucket O' Techno...

Well, tonight was the last one.  I'm out.  I am graduating from CMU and
moving to DC.  WRCT also changed their setup which makes mixing
exceptionally difficult (the speakers can't be switched to monitor the
sudio signal, it's always on the AIR signal which introduced a 30-40ms
delay).

Anyway, if I get enough requests for one last show, I might do it.  but
right now with about 4 phone calls and 2 emails I'm not.  if you want one
last BOT just reply back to me.

So, I guess that's it.  I'll miss you raver chicks, baggy pants boys,
electronica fans, e-tards, jaded and non-jaded, fans, haters of trance,
DnB heads, everyone.  Thanks for trying, listening, and dancing.

One last thought to share.  Time never ends, today never stops, right now
is the time of all time.  Humans can not grasp the infinite.  This is why
we look to circles to capture the infinite in a finite space, we
understand cycles.  Each day has a morning, afternoon, evening, and night.
Each week starts and ends, months in the year.  the years themselves
within the numbers.  music only follows these patterns.

And the cycle starts again.

So i know mp3.com has that thing where suposedly they pay you for how many 
times people listen to your music. There's a trance group on there with 4.5 
MILLION plays to date, and their page shows they've made like over $140k!!! 
Is this shit for real??

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} mp3.com question

i don't know how real that one is, i know you have to get an assload of plays
to make ANYTHING.   i've seen a few make a nice slab of money (astral
projection, skylab 2000, bent frame)

basically, you gotta pay 20$ a month to be in their P4P program (pay for
play)

so really you've gotta hustle like MAD to cover that 20$ a month to make
anything.

to really get any plays on there you've gotta have a HELL of a following or
partake of mp3.coms "payola" where you buy expensive ad space/links.

like when you do a search there, you'll get a "sponsored link" with every
search.  prominent placement on the genre pages also cost mad loot.

i guess if you want to put the effort and money into the promotion end of
things.....

but on the down side, what has happened is people had their accounts revoked
and any money in it frozen.   i know this happened to analogue pussy, and
they lost out on 30k$ or so.  i guess if you start making money they are
likely to freeze or cancel your account.  i'm not sure how or why this
happens.

basically i used them for free streaming & hosting of my mp3s until they
started the popups on the artist pages, since i figured it'd be too much work

 Um...sorry not trying to be an ass here.  But I really must know whats so cutting edge about any of the music on the lineup.  I mean honestly.  I mean I understand if someone was listening to country last week this may be cutting edge to them.  I'll come out to support my girl Boompsie.  If anything there is cutting edge it will be Sherry's new future electro tracks she has been hunting down.  If I'm there Sherry you better be droppin that shit.  You should consider spinning by your lonesome too.  Your too good for tagging girl.  But anyways you still got a good lineup going on wether my pretentious ass thinks its "cutting edge" or not.

i made a deal with a troll i met while i was taking
out the garbage about a month ago. he told me that he
would get me promos from 5 years into the future if i
would burn the hemroid off his lumpy ass with my
cigarette. i dont know if he was doing this for fun or
if it was strictly medicinal. either way... ive got
some pretty cutting edge shit now. and you know i
heard hutch has been pressin plates for about 16 years
now. ill ask him if its time to bring them out. im
sure there are enough tracks there for our whole crew
to share.

i dont know, thats just me and my crew. i hope
everyone else on the line up has some new shit.

 No man thats not it at all.  I got respect for Luke and his events.  I was just stateing that IMO, "cutting edge" was a poor choice of words.  I tried to make it clear that I wasnt putting down his event or its Dj's in anyway.  Just because I dont think something is cutting edge doesnt mean I dont think it is good music.  Some of my favorite tunes coming out right now are stripping it down to more primitive techniques, just doing over it again.  Ahh the forgotten sound of tomorrow.  But anyways dont listen to me...im just a pretentious asshole.

I understand if someone was listening to country last week this may be

anything there is cutting edge it will be Sherry's new future electro tracks
she has been hunting down. If I'm there Sherry you better be droppin that

Take note of the words...
Cutting-edge-to-hit-Cleveland. Maybe that is just
a statement saying that Cleveland is way behind
the times...I can guarantee that people will
hear fresh sounds. Anyway, a little controversy is
good. Differing oppinions is good. That stimulates
conversation and drives results.

Peace,
Luke

Just to add what Luke has said...

Donnie and the Funk Detective have been busy producing some killer
techno tracks and are soon getting another record pressed.  Check them
out under the Moonplastic label.  I'm sure you will be impressed.
Cutting Edge as far as techno is concerned?  They definately are.

If you never heard Jeff Storm perform live, you definitely don't want to
miss him here.  He's added some new hardware to his performance.  It
meshes so nicely with his spinning that you would think he is just
spinning studio produced tracks when it is so much more.  You won't hear
anything like it around here.

You know what Boompsies sound is like, now take that to the next level
in a 2x4 with Meghan.  I've seen them perform it for a group once, and
people are still talking about it.  

Breakbeat Militia... I don't even need to say more really, but when was
the last time you saw a performance of 4 people on 5 turntables and were
totally impressed?  They don't just spin records, they create a sound
and a vibe together.

I could go on... but I'm not.

Cutting Edge?  Maybe not to some... but it sure beats the same old stuff
I've been hearing at parties in Cleveland lately.

I'll definitely be there!  ;-)

Plus there are like 8 responses to the kiss the sky party, hence making it
the most talked about party this weekend on the pb-cle... Might have 10-15
more people show up now.  Great marketing strategy.  Someone needs to reply
to my post so that kiss the sky is in the subject again.

Just helpin out luke, ya know.

Subject: {pb-cle} Ratfink has left the building....

Well, guys....as of Sunday I am now living in California. Right now I'm 
in the San Jose area, but will be moving to Sacramento very shortly.

I know most of you are saying, "Who the hell is this guy?", but my old 
school friends know who I am. If any of my buds from the "good-old days" 
of the list ever need a place to crash out here....feel free to get in 
touch with me.

Thanks for all the great times Pb-Cle....I'll miss ya.

Who really gives a shit if it's physically two objects/People versus two
styles? If yer in it for the music, it wouldn't matter.

Goahead deserves to be respected and their events supported.

Nothing is "UP" with it dude...
two different styles of music, listed
under two different names. Does it matter
if it's the same person? JFC!

There is no "Headliner"  This is a twelve hour
event that will feature some great talent from
some different area's. That word headliner is over
used.

Peace,
Luke

Subject: {pb-cle} I'm done, hope to see you

So anyway.. here's the deal. We are throwing this
party. If you want to come great..if not, that sucks.
It's only $15 (if you come before midnight) for 12
hours of music. I'm not posting another thing about it,
except for maybe a reminder a couple days before the event.
I'm out..talk amongst yourselves.

Peace,
Luke

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Kiss the sky Sat 6-15

I hope to see all of you out there for this.  You all know how hard Goahead 
and DXM strive to throw great events, this party will be no different.  As 
to the skill of the DJs and track selection, I believe their names and 
experience speak for themselves.  Besides this party will be taking place at 
a fresh new venue and lighting and sound is being done by experts.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Denon DP-DJ101 tables question


I use DPDJ151's, and I love them!  They're great for personal use.. I 
wouldn't rent them out or use them for parties all the time, though.  I just 
don't think they would stand up to as much abuse as techs do.. although I 
could be wrong.  I don't want to try my luck, though.  As far as their 
quality, I don't know if they're better than techs, but they're not worse.  
They're just different.  The only big drawback is the lighter construction, 
which makes them feedback a little more easily when there's ons of bass.

If you're on a budget, they're possibly the best tech1200 alternative out 
there.  Plenty of torque (possibly more than techs, although I haven't 
tested it scientifically) and the pitch slider control is superb.  the 
conversion from +-8 to +-12 takes a couple seconds, but it's easy enough.

If you opt for the 151, you also get digital out and Key adjust, both of 
which are pretty nice features.. if you intend to use them.  I tend not to, 
because I know that when I go to a gig those features aren't going to be 
there.  Still, DPDJ151's are going for about $300 nowadays, and I think 
that's a great bargain.

I'm sure tons of people will tell you not to buy anything besides techs.. 
and that's one viewpoint.  I just don't happen to agree with it. :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} get yer FREAK on!!!

This woman is so full of bullshit, it's ridiculous....

IF you had the best intentions of the children in mind, then maybe...just
MAYBE partially disrobing them, and forcing them to lift their skirts in
front of classmates and police officers was not the best route to go??

Call me crazy, but opening your students up to sexual harassment by peers,
officers of the law, and their own TEACHERS is as far from acting "in their
best interest" as you can get....

And the whole "freak dancing" thing? Pure, unadulterated, steaming piles of
bullshit.

Guys, how many times has YOUR dick accidentally fallen out of your pants on
the dance floor?? Much less, fallen out of your pants and INTO the "naughty
bits" of the person you're dancing with?? Underwear or no, most high school
kids do not have the range of experience of your average porn star when it
comes to "interesting positions"...it doesn't just "fall in there".

Some people deserve to lose their entire careers over a single issue, if
that issue is serious enough. She's one of them.

Yeah, I took this quiz a couple days ago on the geriatric list.
Apparently I'm the sf-list resident crackhead "DaisyJunglist," which
is funny, because I don't hang out in e-puddles OR listen to jungle
...

We definitely need a pb-cle quiz.

Subject: {pb-cle} Vertebreak

First off, a GIANT THANK YOU! for anyone that came to the
club cafe tonight! I had a shitload of fun, and I know I speak for the
whole crew of peeps I was around all night when I say that.

A big Hell-fucking yeah, to my boy, my partner in crime on this one, Clevr.
It starts here, bro. It starts here. nuff said.

Mad props to Devin, for coming out and impressing me once more,
with some positively ill selecion, and smooth ass mixing.

Anyone that missed it - Vertebreak was a fucking BLAST!
We've been working hard to find our own little niche, for a couple years
now.
Whether or not we have found it, tonight sure felt damn right.

The people that came out tonight were nothing short of
inspiring to me....I love seeing kids I have never seen before, out on the
floor, just shakin' it and having a great time! Oh yeah, Blake, I met your
friends, where the hell were you? (I think they offered to beat you down
for us, for not coming :)

Stay tuned for more vertebreak events in the future....we have just begun
a wonderful journey, my friends. Thank you, once again.

wow, so funny to see dennis posting about this on here when MP3.com was the
first place i ever heard of and listened to skylab2000 which was one of the
first steps i took getting into electronic music.



i think that was the only time i ever used that site too.

Subject: {pb-cle} Cook da Goose: RSVP now motha$%@^az

Trying to get a good feel for how many guests i will be entertaining this
summer on July 20th.  RSVP to me if you want to come and what you want along
the lines of food, if you want a steak, say "I's be needin me some
motherfuckin cow cuts, yo!"

5pm-? (looks like around 4am) will be the event, with following lineup:

Tom Cox - pittsburgh - uk garage/2 step 

Moose - cleveland - nu skool breaks 

DJ Lemma - columbus - drum n bass - repeat performer from CDG I 

Osmotic - hard trance, breakbeat trance - pittsburgh 

Gravity - NRG, breaks - youngstown - repeat performer from CDG I 

Skillz - speed garage - cleveland 

Jea Leigh - drum n bust - cleveland 

MGS - deep/tech house - columbus 

Ms. Red aka Boompsie - hard tribal techno - cincinnati 

V-el v-et Jones and Vinnie Bricks - funky house tag set - cincinnati 

Goose - columbus - mainly cheese, mixture of dnb, breakbeat, old school hip
hop and classic mexican salsa

As always, those with a mullet have priority on the grill.

Subject: {pb-cle} technics 1200s

If anyone of you aspiring DJs is looking for a good deal on turntables, I
have two brand new technics 1200s (store demo models). All accessories and
paperwork are intact in the boxes. I'm asking $750, and I'm throwing in a
brand new pair of ES DJ Co. slipmats. Email me back privately at
cindycitrus@earthlink.net or cindycitrus@hotmail.com.
Thanks,
Cindy

5pm-? (looks like around 4am) will be the event, with following lineup:

Tom Cox - pittsburgh - uk garage/2 step 

Moose - cleveland - nu skool breaks 

DJ Lemma - columbus - drum n bass - repeat performer from CDG I 

Osmotic - hard trance, breakbeat trance - pittsburgh 

Gravity - NRG, breaks - youngstown - repeat performer from CDG I

Ms. Red aka Boompsie - hard tribal techno - cincinnati 

V-el v-et Jones and Vinnie Bricks - funky house tag set - cincinnati 

Goose - columbus - mainly cheese, mixture of dnb, breakbeat, old school hip
hop and classic mexican salsa

well, the obvious difference is that if he's playing live, you can use EFX
on different channels and split signals to make it actually close to
surround. but since most of the synths and drum machines that ive seen are
only stereo at best, its still not gonna be a true surround unless you have
someone stright up mixing it crazily while hes playing....

some samplers have more than one output and could be setup for quad.

theres also people that have done quad sounds and shite with the nord
modular.

the rack and keyboard version have 4 outs, so you can do quad stuff if you
program it right.....

there's those quad mixers that i think vestax makes?  never seen 'em but i
believe they have the joystick type stuff, theres other gadgets along those
lines.

well you could, but that'd be the hard way to do it, there are controllable
xfader & panning type modules,  you'd use 3 of them.   say the first one to
set front/back, then split the front & back again with the other 2 to get
your front/right, front/left, back/right, & back/left....  they could be
controlled by....  hmmm, LFOs, velocity, aftertouch, continuous controllers,
note, & a some other stuff....

yeah, but AFAIK they don't work quad exactly......  they are for outputting
more than one sound to be processed separately....

aw crap, just forget it. i didn't mean to send that one email to trout to
the whole list but it went anyway, and I REALLY am not trying to have a
public discussion about this. I'm just a person, not a company or something.
For everyone interested in the tables, they are sold and sorry about my
posts-mix-up.

havent seen those. that is still only going to pan a sound one of 4 ways.
true stereo is a sound that is different in the left and right channels.

thats still like panning. true stereo or surround in this case is going to
be different than that.

i just dont think anything is truly made to be quad sound, aside from dvd
audio, which is actually surround not quad but still the sound is different
for each channel, its not just the same sound panned around the 6 speakers.

surround 5.1 is just quad sound (4 speakers with the sound panned around the
x/y plane), a bass speaker to handle the bottom, and a speaker to handle the
"on screen" dialogue.

bass is omni directional, you cant tell where its coming from, your ear can't
pick up the subtle phasing differences on the low frequencies so it cant
determine a location.  i'm not really sure of the advantage to the front
center speaker....

i read an article in some keyboard rag that had herbie hancock or someone or
other that setup their concerts in 5.1 and went into great detail about how
they did it and what they used.....   it was some heavy duty digital mixer
and alot of production level gear....

Wow, now I have something to prove.  What a wondeful thing for somebody with 
a name like "Lemma."

Umm.. so am I supposed to start talking shit now?
So like, yeah.. I'll kick your ass, man.. and stuff.

Ed, you should get some of those gigantic q-tip things so we can have 
jousting tournaments on the porch.  It'll be like American Gladiators!

for any interested here is the first review of my new album...recorder.

http://www.electronicmusicreviews.com/

click through the splash screen and then click on the album, it's in the

they compared the album to Tortoise's "Millions now living will never die", 
Pink Floyds “Set Your Controls for the Heart of the Sun” , KLF's "Chill Out" 
and Borges "Infinite Library"....all good company to be in for sure.

available for purchase here:

i'm not going to demf, but i might go drive up for that one night 
like a true idiot, just for the crowd and the vibe i think will be 
up there in that room.
i always fucking forget how long the drive to detroit is, but this 
pink floyd
sound system shit is worth investigating. last year i had so much 
hedonistic fun it would be worth risking a let down this year.

i just want to hear substance abuse ONE FREAKING TIME coming out 
of a sound system like that. last year the sound blew my mind away 
so i can only imagine what this year would be like.

we'll see

because they were store demo models (but were never even used, the boxes
were just open) from the store my boyfriend used to work at. we got a good
deal on some, but now that we're moving, we can't keep them and we need the
money. OK??????????????????????????????? And besides, I already sold them so
what's it to you? (and you really don't have to answer that, it's a
rhetorical question).

we had this discussion a while back, you might have missed it. quadraphonic
records were not really quadrophonic and they required different decoders to
use them which would rip a slightly delayed second set of stereo programs
from the vinyl to send to the close speakers while the first one went to the
far away speakers. and there were 4 major companies making quad records,
each with their own decoder. so if he did it  today, hed have to pick a
decoder and then (likely) pay the manufaturer for the ability to use their
format, and then find a place that would cut the records, if one even
exists. so i HIGHLY doubt that hes just making new quad records.

and darwin and nanotek, you guys still need to get off the guy's jock. if he
was playing stuff reminiscient of "consumed" i would understand, but hes not
do i dont.

but there are prerecorded pans in there, like a car moving from left to

going to sound quite as awesome as something prerecorded specifically for
dobly surround, like a movie is.

i dont understand this, i can tell where bass is coming from just fine, even
if its just by the severity of the vibrations.

i think i read something about that too, herbie hancock is a crazy crazy

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP: If Funky Charms 3 was a superb experience, wait for this yaaaaalz

Greetings from the Euphorix Profunk summer portal,
In early July, the creators of the Funky Charms series will soon co-host
a 100% female lineup, as alluded to on the bottom back section of the
Funky Charms 3 flyer. When flyers for PowerPuffin Girls hit the street, it
will be sure to please any and all supporters of this idea less frequently
tried in the N.E. Ohio region. As we continue to endlessly collaborate and
explore new and exciting realms of possibility, it is now time to give
sole spotlight access to our valued female population. Although there are
some who may consider this an extremist or sexist endeavor, we want to
emphasize that this is not to make female talent stand out as outcasts,
nor is it an exploitation of the gender itself. Rather, this event very
simply expresses that there are some females in the woodworks who may feel
unsure of the support they would get if stepping out into the public eye,
which is occasionally critical. We already know who the local talents are
who have a following, and we most definitely intend to include the
obvious, yet similar to Funky Charms visions, we enjoy bringing new
prospects to the stage, thus helping the scene evolve as veterans get
older, get famous and move on, or simply become lurkers in shadows.
Whatever the case, the time is now to fill the shoes and remind our
community how important diversity is to culture and history. 
Our lineup is still open for spots....any contacts for female talent (DJ,
Live PA, etc) from this list are greatly appreciated. Any requests or
insight is also welcomed and needed. We look forward to providing top
quality events to the very best of our abilities; we assure nothing short
of a memorable time in history for all involved.
Keep Learned and thanks in advance for any additions to our intelligence
pool.
Euphorix Reprozent,
Alien Gonzales
4Rilla!!!

Why?  I just want to know why it has to be an all girls lineup?  It's
reminiscent of the way that j-brick set up lineups last year ie) the twins,
making everything a tag... I just wish that people would be happy with
booking solid talent, gender has no bearing on it.  If you want to lure
people with females, then just exploit them with applesauce wrestling, a la
hookers on ice.... Mmm speaking of... Hey person that was gonna send me
those pics, did you ever get a chance?

Greetings from the Euphorix Profunk summer portal,
In early July, the creators of the Funky Charms series will soon co-host a
100% female lineup, as alluded to on the bottom back section of the Funky
Charms 3 flyer. When flyers for PowerPuffin Girls hit the street, it will be
sure to please any and all supporters of this idea less frequently tried in
the N.E. Ohio region. As we continue to endlessly collaborate and explore
new and exciting realms of possibility, it is now time to give sole
spotlight access to our valued female population. Although there are some
who may consider this an extremist or sexist endeavor, we want to emphasize
that this is not to make female talent stand out as outcasts, nor is it an
exploitation of the gender itself. Rather, this event very simply expresses
that there are some females in the woodworks who may feel unsure of the
support they would get if stepping out into the public eye, which is
occasionally critical. We already know who the local talents are who have a
following, and we most definitely intend to include the obvious, yet similar
to Funky Charms visions, we enjoy bringing new prospects to the stage, thus
helping the scene evolve as veterans get older, get famous and move on, or
simply become lurkers in shadows. Whatever the case, the time is now to fill
the shoes and remind our community how important diversity is to culture and
history. 
Our lineup is still open for spots....any contacts for female talent (DJ,
Live PA, etc) from this list are greatly appreciated. Any requests or
insight is also welcomed and needed. We look forward to providing top
quality events to the very best of our abilities; we assure nothing short of
a memorable time in history for all involved. Keep Learned and thanks in
advance for any additions to our intelligence pool. Euphorix Reprozent,
Alien Gonzales 4Rilla!!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} this looks interesting...


Your ears are actually incapable of telling where subwoofer frequencies are 
coming from.  We're talking about stuff that's below about 100Hz here.  If 
you're able to figure out where a subwoofer is by the vibrations, that 
probably means you're hearing some upper range frequencies from rattling, 
etc.  It could also be that a crossover was set too high.  You can also 
usually see subwoofers in a venue, so you may already know where the bass is 
coming from, and thus *think* that you can *hear* where it's coming from...

Some of the more knowledgable people can correct me here, but I think PA 
subwoofers are often crossed over at higher frequencies than home theater 
subs, because they're usually put in the same place as the full range 
speakers (albeit on the floor) so the non-directionality isn't as much of a 
factor as distributing the frequencies to the drivers that can play them 
best.

That sounds more like a rationalization to me than a good reason. So, you're going to throw people already hesitant of criticism under greater scrutiny by putting them under a bright "gender-only" spotlight? If a woman hesitates to spin under the genderless anonymity of a "regular" line-up, what makes you think that she would be even more willing to put herself in the limelight of a lineup that is scrutinizing her simply because she is a woman and draw even more attention to that fact? So basically you're capitalizing on what you perceive to be her primary insecurity?

I by all means would support anyone trying to help an up-and-coming artist, regardless of circumstance. 

But I really believe we should be supporting each other regardless of race, gender, economic status, sexual orientation, or whatever. One of the fundamental, idealistic "core beliefs" of our scene is / was that all those other labels that you were known by on the "outside world" were stripped and checked at the door the minute you entered the party/club/venue and you were known for whatever unique gifts your spirit brought, and not what the material world graced you with.

Please leave it to Hollywood and television to use tits and ass to sell entertainment. I highly doubt Irene or Sandra Collins or Baby Anne or Misstress Barbara made their big breaks at a "Pow(d)er Puff" event. If you really want to support women trying to make it, then put them in a "regular" party at a "regular" lineup.

Hello all;

Over a year has passed since my last CD release, so I decided to 
put together a mix of some of my favorite music. As with the 
majority of my previous mixes, the new mix 'expo' features 
numerous styles of techno. Please feel free to download the mp3 at?

?or respond to this email and I?ll gladly send you a copy on CD. 
Please include your current address cause it may have been a while 
since I?ve been in touch with many of you.

  Greetings from the Euphorix Profunk summer portal,
  In early July, the creators of the Funky Charms series will soon =
co-host a
  100% female lineup, as alluded to on the bottom back section of the =
Funky
  Charms 3 flyer. When flyers for PowerPuffin Girls hit the street, it =
will be
  sure to please any and all supporters of this idea less frequently =
tried in
  the N.E. Ohio region. As we continue to endlessly collaborate and =
explore
  new and exciting realms of possibility, it is now time to give sole
  spotlight access to our valued female population. Although there are =
some
  who may consider this an extremist or sexist endeavor, we want to =
emphasize
  that this is not to make female talent stand out as outcasts, nor is =
it an
  exploitation of the gender itself. Rather, this event very simply =
expresses
  that there are some females in the woodworks who may feel unsure of =
the
  support they would get if stepping out into the public eye, which is
  occasionally critical. We already know who the local talents are who =
have a
  following, and we most definitely intend to include the obvious, yet =
similar
  to Funky Charms visions, we enjoy bringing new prospects to the stage, =
thus
  helping the scene evolve as veterans get older, get famous and move =
on, or
  simply become lurkers in shadows. Whatever the case, the time is now =
to fill
  the shoes and remind our community how important diversity is to =
culture and
  history.
  Our lineup is still open for spots....any contacts for female talent =
(DJ,
  Live PA, etc) from this list are greatly appreciated. Any requests or
  insight is also welcomed and needed. We look forward to providing top
  quality events to the very best of our abilities; we assure nothing =
short of
  a memorable time in history for all involved. Keep Learned and thanks =
in
  advance for any additions to our intelligence pool. Euphorix =
Reprozent,
  Alien Gonzales 4Rilla!!!

Subject: {pb-cle} Misunderstood on Girl Issue..........

ANYWAY.....................
     Obviously, one would be quite the buffoon to try and CAPITALIZE on
insecurities of women that are hesitant of stepping on to a scene, and
then expect a stellar performance. The "gender-only" spotlight is not the
focus of the evening, and thus is not the subject of scrutiny. Let me
explain further. Fact: There are far less female performers than male in
our scene. If a female newcomer is hesitant about performing at a
"regular" event for the very first time, it is most likely due to
"regular" butterflies as any first-time performance may produce for any
female or male newbie,  AND  ,  ALSO   the lack of gender representation
.... I think both of these things play some part in her hesitation. If she
decides to play at this "regular" event, and she gets scrutinized by the
audience, MORE attention is drawn to her gender since almost all other
heads on the lineup are of the opposite gender, hence she is possibly seen
as an outcast or even lost cause in certain cases. 
If she is unsure of what support she would have in general, surely fellow
female newcomers on the same lineup can relate to her insecurities and
together these women can shake any scrutiny, if any arises, by showing
their audience that talent is NOT gender related and an all-girl event can
be considered a "regular" party, too. Furthermore, if she's unsure of how
much support she would have, we want to be the people to show her support,
too, and we want for the population to rate this talent intelligently
without sexist overtones. If she was good, then she was good because she
made the crowd move, had a great track selection, smooth mixing, etc. etc.
and not because she's a girl. If she was bad, she was bad on technical
mishaps, wrecks, etc. and not because she was a girl...............
I've heard ignorant remarks at several shows, like " Oh her? She
sucks.....just look at her," when actually she threw down a smart-assed
set; or "Damn! That girl was the best DJ ever! Damn she hot as f$#k!" when
she couldn't match a beat to save her ass. No T&A sales here nor Hollywood
sugar coating on any level- 
My core belief is that no one can ever avoid labels and stereotypes that
come from the "outside world", however by standing in unison and
supporting each other's goals, these labels stand for nothing and will be
disregarded- surpassed. In other words, you cannot control what others do-
you can only control yourself and your response to difficult situations...
either let stereotypes, regularity, and words get the best of you, or do
yourself a favor and be the master of your own destiny.

As much as people like to hate on DJ Rap (and i'm no exception) .. I have
a bunch of old skool sets from her that are pretty sick.. and no
trainwrecks either. yeah plenty of anthems, but she was a pretty good DJ
back in the day. not to mention that she's been around longer than most of
the people who talk shit on her, even if trying to go "pop," having people
engineer her tunes, and running her own label aren't necessarily
considered "credits" to her name.  Gotta give her credit enough for going
far to the point where people will pay money to see her and think she is
a sick DJ even if now she sucks.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Misunderstood on Girl Issue..........

Its funny, the ROM posting for this party says that if you're a female
and want to be considered you have to send a picture and demo to Chris
Hardman.

Heh... They gonna be modeling for us too?!  Or is he just hanging them
on his bedroom wall?!

<The "gender-only" spotlight is not the
focus of the evening,<

But it certainly was the focus of your post, the theme of the party, and the "hook" of your bsp. 

(Unless, of course, the "Power Puff" name somehow refers to a drag queen theme, in which case I would refer you to Crobar Miami's "back door bamby" theme on Mondays for ideas)

The point under scrutiny is the a priori assumption that you're making that you feel women need to somehow be separated out, featured, or otherwise sheltered or nutured from the "average" kind of event in order to be given a fair chance to play or be given criticism on a level playing field.

So while you are trying to level the playing field for individual dj's at an all-female event, you escalate the sexist problem by bringing more spotlight to the fact that it's an "all-female" event. You also segregate them from other male talented dj's that might otherwise flow well into the female's styles and genres. 

Any music critic worth his or her salt won't give a damn whether or not the person behind the mixer is male, female, or trans-gendered. 

If you personally care enough about the opinions of someone ignorant enough to say that a girl got a gig only because she's cute, or of a promoter who gave a girl a gig only because she's a girl, or that a girl trainwrecked just because she's a girl, then maybe you need to re-examine who you need to ingnore and let fester in their own small little world.

You will not change attitudes of ignorant or otherwise classless individuals by emphasizing the problem. You will change attitudes by not buying into their assumptions.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Misunderstood on Girl Issue..........

please don't insult our intelligence by saying that it is anything but a way
to stack some loot by exploiting women.  i can tell you that many female
dj's refuse to play 'all female raves' because they know it too.  want a
list?  no problem - how about magda, minx, mistress barbara, and shiva.

taken from the ROM
<<<
Needs to contact Chris at Hardmanmusic@hotmail.com with a picture and
demo.
>>>

you need a picture?  are you fucking kidding me?  ARE THEY APPLYING FOR A
JOB AT HOOTERS???  if you're a female dj playing at this party, shame on
you.  i hope you're getting paid a lot, because i'm sure euphorix will.

the party is completely whack - END OF STORY

rave on or something.

Subject: {pb-cle} to trinity powerhuffin and powerpuffin'..............

The Powerpuffin Girls kick ass, as will the ladies performing at this
event. The focus of the subject line was party hearty people. The focus of
the post was to engage the idea that there are some talented females who
have yet to get out there and express their musicianship- in light that
it's POSSIBLE that some of them might not have the confidence to answer to
our request for talent to complete the lineup, we want them to know that
they can count on us for support and we intend to make this party fun and
memorable. I never once said that a lineup with all females was absolutely
necessary for these women to get a fair crack at playing; I also never
said anything about nurturing women from the "average" event for the sake
of equal critique. Again, the spotlight is not on the "all-female" event
itself. The only spotlight around is the one shining on their talents
respectively as individual people. You are making this an issue and it
isn't an issue. I don't understand why you feel that it's so wrong to
celebrate and regenerate diversity in this scene, but this event does not
entertain any "emphasis of a problem." 
You are right in one sense- Anyone who is classless and ignorant enough to
make such remarks is certainly not changing their attitude if you
emphasize that problem. The problem is that you make it a problem by
continuing to be so pessimistic. 
I do not buy into any igorant assumptions, however, you change people's
attitudes by sharing with them new ideas and goals; this can lead to
better opinions. By having an all-female event, it does not emphasize that
women are being hated on, it emphasizes that respect should be given where
respect is due. I care about EVERYBODY, no matter how ignorant I feel
their opinion is- by sharing my views and offering alternate solutions to
people's hangups on women or whatever the issue, maybe I can make an
influence and help someone to better themselves by finding new respect in
others. I said the LABELS would be disregarded- not the people, if we can
stand beside diversity and create more tolerance for everything and
anything. If a person still outputs such negative nonsense, then karma
will lead them in a different direction, but there's no need to ignore
them altogether.
Don't misread what I'm saying. I'm not trying to level a playing
field...I'm not trying to protect or rescue anyone... we are happy that
girls kick ass and that's final.
Have a nice Euphoric day,
Alien G

Then please address the requirement that the women send in a photo in addition to the demo.

Or why men are excluded from the lineup (if it's about diversity).

I will say this... I have not been to a bad Euphorix event yet.   I'll
trust their judgement on throwing a quality event.  I'm certainly not
gonna pass up on an opportunity to watch a bunch of female DJs either.

I still think they should book Moke with a wig though.  :-)  (well, on
second though, maybe not, I'm not sure I'd wanna see that!)

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} to trinity powerhuffin and powerpuffin'..............

Why send in a photo with a demo? Hmmm... maybe we like to have pictures
for every performer on our flyers if possible--Funky Charms flyers give
you any indication that photo inclusion is generally Euphorix habit? We
ask all DJ's to give us a photo if they can.

OK, fine. What is going on in your head? What judgement are you passing in
my direction anyway? Do you think we want an all-girl party so the kids
will think it's cool enough to pay money for a glitzy flyer and girls
being put on a faulty pedestal so our crew can profit from poking fun at
the minority status of women in electronic music artistry? What kind of
person do you take me for?    "Look at the girls...They are so
cute....They are so great and we want everyone to see how cute and silly
the girl DJ's are all in one shot.....Look at em up there being all girly
and cool..." I have survived enough promotional setbacks to carry an
intelligent mindset and a fairly acute awareness of my surroundings. My
crew and I have been very lucky to have been an influence in this region
as long as we have thus far... we have succeeded with that for far greater
reasons than throwing parties and balling on profits. I know what I do
affects other people, so don't treat me like I am blind to these issues
that you are choosing to manifest in this conversation. We have a vision
that everyone gets stimulated with extreme positivity when cultivating
vibe at our events... patience, understanding and optimism are the
lifelines of what our group is all about. Yeah, there are things in
culture and general life that aren't the most joyful of situations, such
as sexism and glass ceilings and whatever, but calling attention to
everything that's wrong for you is a great way to get nowhere fast. My
attention is on positively throwing a good party, positively respecting
the talents we bring in for it, and most of all, positively sharing love
of good music with the community with which I belong. Sometimes shitty
shit presents itself, and I choose to use it as an opportunity to better
things instead of wallowing in the thought if its existence. I know women
are treated unfairly in all realms of business and pleasure. I know some
women are shafted so bad it affects everyone around them. OK? You act like
I don't realize where I live. So what if there are no male performances at
this party? As much diversity as there is in the male DJ realm, from Carl
Cox to Dieselboy to KnifeHandChop, there is just as much diversity in
female artists, from Rap to Mistress Barbara to Madonna to Yabette.
Whatever. Females are human beings with the ability to decide and choose
what is best for them. If someone has issues with our perspective on
things, they can choose not to perform in our festivities. Just remember
that we have purpose behind what we do... haphazardness - ignorance and
greed are not part of our big picture. We appreciate women and the
diversity within their abilities. There is no need to negate, criticize
and cause drama with doubt and suspicion. Instead of taking part in being
AGAINST OUR idea, maybe you can attend to being FOR something else. Honor
the importance of positivity- it's a much more rewarding experience in
this short life on earth.

Well, that is such a big revelation, now isn't it! 

If you have had success with the parties you've thrown to date, then stick with what you have done, pick good women and men both for your line-ups, and the rest will evolve. 

Please. Advance the scene. Rise above. Push the envelope. Do your thing. But keep sex and gender out of it.

m.g.s. was right: Whack. Completely Whack.

Subject: {pb-cle} For the love of Powerpuff..*sigh*

I felt that you were hinting that I was ignorant, so I felt an urge to say
the obvious so you would understand that I'm not a bloody numbskull. I
wasn't trying to teach you a lesson or reveal secrets of enlightenment in
the 4th dimension. I sense an eventual conclusion to this ping pong match
we've been playing: I am keeping sex/gender out of it. Sex and gender to
me make no difference. They are conceptualizations. Deep down inside, it
is personality and charisma and generosity and good-heartedness that
matter. You see sex and gender as important factors on whether a party
will succeed or not, however I do not. You continue to take this stand
against our promoting lineups with all females, yet it has been going on
with males forever. I don't think you care to acknowledge the musically
inclined women out there who actually feel underappreciated. Yes, there
are female DJs who refuse to play where they feel exploited if all the
other performers are of the same sex. If that's how they feel, then best
of wishes on all future endeavors, and thanks nonetheless. Those females
with such an opinion are but a piece of the whole, thus some girls have
different feelings on the issue. We lay a open booking out to a new girl,
and it's her call. We stand by our word and will support her with every
fiber of our bean. If that still conflicts with her values, we wish her
well and that's that. Because you make it in issue, you see it as sexist
and not taking women seriously. Because I don't make it an issue, it is an
opportunity for people to integrate and communicate in new ways. Sticking
to a routine is complacency, and that is devastating. We do rise above
whenever times are right. We advance the scene and cultivate positive vibe
by staying on its track. Sex and gender are issues you brought to the
table by taking a stand "as if it were an issue". I choose to surround
myself with open-ended possibilities and nothing less. I cannot afford to
spend energy determining who's right and wrong on issues... I think your
points make sense in someways...in other ways, I feel that your
sensitivity toward this dramatic issue you've produced in your mind is
fruitless in the end. I wish you the very best despite our perspectives
clashing so much, and I'm sorry if you are offended by our actions...
Politics are just not my cup of tea.
Good night

Subject: {pb-cle} LIVE TONIGHT! Sunrize/DJ Tronic/DJ Reese! [INFECTIOUS RADIO!]  <bsp>

This week on Infectious, we will feature America's hottest happy hardcore 
producer, along with two of our famous (infamous?) residents for your 
listening enjoyment. No gimmicks this week (well, except for DJ PRANK 
CALLS!), just straight up music!

TUNE IN @ http://www.liquidvinyldjs.com/live.pls

On WEDNESDAY night, 5/15/02, INFECTIOUS will feature the following lineup:

6:00pm - 7:00pm (9:00pm - 10:00pm EST):

DJ Reese (Liquidvinyldjs.com, SF):

In our regular rotation is our co-founder, always bringing you the finest in

Sunrize (SC Hardcore, Rave'N Beats USA; Pittsburgh, PA):

Right now, no happy hardcore producer in the USA is hotter than this guy. 
With upcoming releases like "Memories" (Pitched Up Recordings), "Dream 
Forever" (Rave'N Beats USA), and "Still Love U" (Rave'N Beats USA), he is 
quickly making his mark as both a talented DJ and composer. He's put 
together a slammin set featuring some of his music, so make sure you're in 
tune for the future!

8:00pm - 9:00pm (11:00pm - 12:00am EST):

DJ Tronic (Liquidvinyldjs.com, Resistance Recordings; SF):

Now that his schedule has slowed a bit after Overload, Tronic is coing 
at'cha again to bang that U.S. hard house into your dome! Expect a gabber 
tune or two as well, as he always keeps you on your toes!

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} For the love of Powerpuff..*sigh*

<You continue to take this stand
against our promoting lineups with all females, yet it has been going on
with males forever.> Maybe I missed this chapter in the "History of the Dance Music Scene" somewhere, but I don't recall too many promoters deliberately saying, "Hey--let's keep the girls outta this one and make it all dudes heh, heh"

<I don't think you care to acknowledge the musically
inclined women out there who actually feel underappreciated.>
Yes, I do, because I am one of them. I get told all the time in this part of the country that my penchant for hard, deep, epic trance is because I am a woman. Ever see those "trance is for pussies" t-shirts? It's very hard to convince people who have never experienced the genre in Europe or some of the larger US and Canadian cities that there's so much more to it than the latest pop anthem.

I wish you the best of luck with your promoting endeavors, because good events can only result in good vibes all around. But I hope that some of our discussion has made you (and others) aware of how pejorative and condescending the all-female concept can be. At the end of the day if we haven't learned anything... (then it's time to stay up longer)

I'm out.

Subject: {pb-cle} Non Standard Venues

When';s the last time a party's been at a venue not normally a club?

Seems liks forever, or maybe I've just been away too long....

Also, can someone hit me back privately with the web info relating to the
detour2 party last fall...my harddrive crashed last week, so I've lost most
everything, and wanted to keep that link.

Well..Irene exploits the female thing pretty good herself - Ever seen her
"#1 Female DJ" posters..T&A all over em.
(not hers of course,  lol)

Madame Mercury though...she won't even play at an all female event.
Her reason - exploitation of gender is bullshit.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Misunderstood on Girl Issue..........

Hmm...Can we hear some opinions of some of the female DJ's on here?

Or just listen to a male promoter/DJ rationalize the exploitation of gender
for his event?

If you are promoting an "all one gender/race/ethnicity" event, you are
exploiting that as a marketing tool....Otherwise, just book all females,
based on their talent...then promote it based on such, not advertising
it as "All Female" or whatever...

If the "Gender-only spotlight" is not the focus, then why promote it as
though
it is? You made it the spotlight, and now you are saying it isn't?

hmmm.

actually on this point there was a promoter that threw a party recently in
cle that was interested in demos from djs, they wanted basically a promo
pack--a cd, a headshot, & a bio.....

they i guess did concert promotions or something previously so i guess thats
where they had the idea from???

anyhow, just a different spin on it.

Subject: {pb-cle} all female lineups

just wanted to add a few thoughts...

i was part of a crew that threw an all female party in pgh in 2000. when we
decided to do it, it was because 90% of the lineup were male, and there are
a lot of really great female artists out there who aren't getting as much
exposure.

almost every performer asked us about our motives and made us explain why we
were throwing the party before they agreed to play. and apparently a lot of
female djs won't play at all female parties if they don't think you are
doing it for the "right" reasons.

i have no problem with people wanting to expose new talent. and i think a
lot of our point was that there are a large number of female djs who are
just as skilled and talented, but maybe just don't have the name status of
the headliners yet. though there are quite a few women headliners
nowadays...

before i continue rambling... the whole point is, try not to judge people's
motives until you ask a few questions. and promoters, if people have
questions, answer them. you should have nothing to hide from the people
paying to come to your parties. and i guess, i just don't think that all
female lineups are a bad idea. would you bitch if it was an all male lineup?
highly unlikely, because that's what 90% of the time ((or hopefully less
now)) happens anyway.

have a goodnight,
dori

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

You know to expect the only the raunchy best from Northern Virginia’s 
Syndicate crew.  Their tag-team patio sets are traditionally one of the 
stand-out nights of the summer season.  Expect outrageous behavior, 
boorish men, lewd women and of course excellent music, with styles ranging 
from house to drum ‘n’ bass to neo-electro to breaks to techno.  On top of 
it all, it’s Sinestro’s birthday — longstanding ringleader of the 
Syndicate.  Make sure to spank him silly.  And from Luxx in NY it’s the DC 
debut of Linus, “The World’s ‘Worst’ Rapper.” Some things have to be heard 
to be believed...

in Sterling, and the other, a Saturday night weekly named Stereo which 
begins Saturday, June 22nd.  For more information on 5" Taint check out

"Comedy Tragedy" to his works today - which included work on the
soundtrack for Ralph Nader's Presidential Campaign, Woody continues to be
one of the techno's brightest stars. www.djesp.com. TECHNO AND ACID HOUSE

PAUL BIRKEN : Tone Wrecker : Catalyst : Minneapolis, MN : LIVE P.A. Paul
is an International techno hero, as if you didn't know by now. Starting
with his acidic Son of Gonzo releases in the mid-90's, up to the
launching of his own label, Birken has always worked his ass off to get
people groovin. His records on Communique (that's Woody McBride's label)
have sold out here and in Europe and it's our pleasure to bring you one
of the world's finest dj/producers. www.ToneWrecker.com TECHNO/LIVE PA

DJ DRAGON : N'Telligence Recordings : Denver, CO : Well our buddy Dragon
tore it up so much at Phreaky Deaky 1, we just had to bring him back.

shaken not stirred. www.DJ-DRAGON.com EPIC TRANCE

super tec-house tag-team between two Cleveland all-stars on the decks. A
pounding hour and a half taking you higher. 2x4 TEC HOUSE TAG TEAM

DJ NOSTALGIC : Downtown Entertainment : sundayLIVE : Dayton, OH : Roger
is one of our area's top DJS and is a funky disco house master of the
highest degree. Get ready for the funky-mix-master. FUNKY DISCO HOUSE

MATT FREEMAN : Flashpoint : Buckwyld : Dayton, OH : This DJ/producer has
been banging tracks out since before many of us had ever heard our first
electronica track. Back from his recent tour of Australia with Paul
Birken, Matt always pleases with his head-bobbing sounds. HARD HOUSE

ALI OBVIOUS : Bounce Theory : Dayton, OH : Dana has been at the forefront
of the Ohio drum and bass and jungle movement from the beginning. He's
teamed with Bounce Theory to bring some of the best events ever to the
Midwest and will be bringing a full crate of the sickest beats around.
DRUM AND BASS

Fri Jun 07                SHIMON & ANDY C @ groove               Pittsburgh

Friday June 7th 2002
Pittsburgh PA

Red Tape Productions Presents


SHIMON & ANDY C.
   Live @ Groove


Featuring:

ANDY C.     Ram Records, Liftin Spirits, Uk

The Chiefs in charge of the entire Ram Operation are, as you should know 
by now, none other than Andy C. and Ant Miles.  Ram Records kicked off in 
early ’92 with Andy’s now highly collectable “Sour Mash” EP. Around this 
time, Ant was expecting his first child, forcing Andy to go solo on such 
singles as “Bass Logic” and “Elevation” in ’93. Once Ant got back in the 
studio, the bond known as “Origin Unknown” blew up with the classic EP 
“Valley of the Shadows”. RAM Records reputation only grew, especially 
after the track won Best Hardcore Tune at the 1993 Hardcore Dance Awards; 
as well Andy received the award for ‘Best Newcomer). In ’94 and ’95, work 
came thick and fast for Origin Unknown with tracks like “Truly One” and 
“Cool Down”. Threw various alias’, the duo released timepiece tunes such 
as “Beyond Bass” and “Here and Now”. Around this time, Andy hooked up with 
Randall to create “the Sound Control” 12”.  Andy also found himself DJing 
at major bashes such as Innovation, Desire, Dreamscape and Jungle Fever. 
Around ’96, Andy hooked up with Shimon to create “Quest” and “Nightflight” 
that took their names to greater acclaim.  1997 marked a new Era in Ram 
history as Andy C. & Shimon’s tracks “Recharge” and “Quest VIP” hit 
worldwide markets, bringing them the award for ‘Best Album’ at the 1996 
Hardcore Dance Awards; Andy received ‘Best Producer’.  In 1998, the birth 
of Ram Trilogy marked three classic EP’s, with this Andy went on to host 
London’s Kiss FM as well as performing at Ram Sessions at the End, 
Movement, Helter Skelter, Metalheadz, Warning, One Nation and other 
locations all around the world, bringing him the Status as ‘Best Dj’ at 
the 1999 Knowledge Awards.  



SHIMON  Ram Records, Liftin Spirits, Uk

You cannot mention the name Shimon without the images of his long time 
compatriots, Andy C and Ant Miles, instantly filtering into the same 
picture. Although the outline of Shimon is often blurred by the notoriety 
of his Ram Trilogy clique, he remains one of the primary colours of the 
Ram Records rainbow, and is very much an individual. Certain DJ's and 
producers within our scene have attained celebrity-like statuses through 
their outstanding and revolutionary work. Due to this it becomes 
increasingly difficult not to herald them on the lofty platform from which 
their achievements derive, and harder to converse with them on a level 
that does not smack of inferiority. Talking to Shimon helps to ignite the 
set stereotypes that have evolved from the upper tier of drum and bass; 
quashing any preconceived notions of a fixed social hierarchy in an 
instant. Requesting an interview from him can be paralleled to asking any 
one of the smiley faced, enthusiastic junglists you associate with your 
typical rave for a bottle of water; such is the honesty and enthusiasm of 
his reply.



MC GQ        Emcee Recordings, UK

MC GQ has been a figurehead and spokesman for the scene for years. 
Originally GQ was most known as the voice of the legendary AWOL, at the 
Paradise Club. Since then he has evolved in stature, becoming quite 
possibly, the most well respected and requested MC in his field.
Through the years he's broadened his horizons, venturing world wide, 
representing and promoting the cause. With a view to the future, he is 
currently establishing his record label 'Emcee Recordings', which is 
striving to encompass the entire spectrum of Drum 'n' Bass. 
Randall, Andy, Hype, Bailey - they all make him work differently. He tries 
to switch his style to read the music, "All the DJ's give you different 
energy". To GQ the inspiration comes from everywhere, It would be 
impossible to narrow it down to any particular source. Music inspires 
everyone, so listen and understand...

I have to say, even if I was not involved in the production of this event, I
would be there full steam.  The lineups are incredible and anytime you have
crews of this nature coming together, you can guarantee a good night.  So
many positives are coming out of this.  For only $15 bones as well.

I simply cannot wait.

We've said it before, and we'll say it again, we are
COMPLETELY revamping the club for this night(All 6
rooms).  Even though the space is phat enough itself
in size and sound, each production crew has put a
theme of there own into each room.  I can also tell
you that the light shows are gonna be on point.  We'll
be giving out over 1000 cd's, tons of posters, shirts,
stickers, hell I think i might bring a couple thousand
condoms again!  DC REPRESENTING THIS NIGHT!!! GET YOUR
TICKETS SOON.

NOTE:Tickets will be sold @ all the listed ticket

I'll second this.
I'd support any endevour that Euphorix decides to promote.
If you know this crew, or know anything about this crew....

I remember that party. I was 23 at the time, and one of the ravers
working the door carded me. I didn't have my ID on me, and this chick
was actually NOT going to let me in since I could not prove that I
was over 17. I ended up having a fellow listie who knew the door
chick verify that I was, indeed, not 17 or younger. I guess it was a
good sign that the people throwing this party were so conscious of
not letting young kids in, but damn, if I hadn't been able to get in
I would have been pretty pissed ...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} all female lineups

it was a good time, they had some goofy stuff that i didn't really understand
....  the singing bit.   but otherwise a good party.

i think that was the night bennie ran amok with a toilet brush, or was that
dan sidetrakkt's party out there at that venue (west oak athletic club or
something like that)

i remember being tired as hell though and not lasting very long that night, i
think we dipped out around 4.

whatever happened to shell?  i haven't heard from her in a minute???

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} all female lineups

I dont see what the problem would be with an all female line-up.  I would 
actually like to see it done again!  People are paying to go to parties to 
hear good talent....whether it be male/female, that shouldnt matter.  I 
guess its all in what someone likes, and a promoter cant make every person 
goin to parties happy.  If you dont like the line up....dont go!  Its your 
decision to spend the money on that party or not.  Go and listen to the 
dj's....you might find out that you actually enjoy what you are hearing.  
Dont seclude yourself to one genre or hate on the dj for their gender!  Just 
my 2 cents!

Peace,
Jen

NO! I do NOT mean Don's sound. Were you at this party? It was held in
a high school gym and the acoustics were horrible. The best sound
system in the world would have sounded like ass in there.

You do mean Don's sound though, because he provided the sound that 
evening.

There were probably less than 10 parties in the last 5 years that 
happened in Pittsburgh that Don didn't do sound for.


but the acoustics did suck dick, they always did there.

Does anyone here use Nuendo or any other 5.1 capable mixing software?  I 
haven't started too yet, but I here it does Dolby 5.1 mixing and I'm sure 
there are pleanty of other better virtual mixer software apps that could 
handle some quad tweaking of active monitor channels from external input.  
Just how realtime it is, I have know idea yet, sounds like fun.  Few more 
jumps in processor speed and this shit will be childs play / no latency / 
external controlllers.  droool..... gear jones

Do any of you 216'ers have any leads on some good studio lofts, like 
wherehouse style.  Hit me up private style, if you do.  I am very very loud 
and need a mad scientist type lab to live and such.  I don't think any 
normal places would allow my noise level and my cats.

Subject: {pb-cle} all girl line ups / dj irene is the anti-christ


not really.  but she's like the rock star lesbian version of armand or bad
boy bill.  i don't think she represents the general female dj population.
she's fonkay ....

anyway....

the fact that most of the top female djs ignore these sorts of events is
your answer.  there's no market for it and there are no players to
participate.  given the high concentration of gay males in your crowd, i'd
say that there's no audience either.  perverted, testosterone driven males
are not only the minority, but they usually transform into rainbow clad
passives in an effort to "blend".  i don't predict any future movement based
on giving the 25cent draft crowd incentive to come around.

most djs are very serious about their music.  they aren't going to want to
be flaunted around like a circus act.  if they want to show up looking
gorgeous in addition to playing well, awesome.  but it shouldn't be a
requirement.  tis tacky.

"it is now time to give sole spotlight access to our valued female
population."

why ?  or at least, why mention it ?  why not simply book female djs.  i'm
sure people will notice the pattern and draw their own conclusions based on
how the event has been promoted and how the performances are.

look around you and you will see #1 heterosexual females, #2 homosexual
males, #3 some of the most feminine straight males on the planet, and #4
heterosexual males.  females don't need "support".  they aren't kept down by
the white dj man.  the industry is run by straight women and gay men to a
great degree.  definitely not low on the female energy end of things.

as for the photo thing...there are two possibilities :
#1 you think there are so many technically excellent girls out there that
you just have to start taking other things into consideration in order to
narrow it down.
#2 you're willing to book someone based on the way she looks, regardless of
skill.
i know that the first isn't true.  poop.

as for djs working the sex angle....

most girls i know play down their sexuality when trying to communicate
important ideas, especially dealing with the opposite sex.  usually, showing
off your body is a distraction and might make someone take you less
seriously for the simple fact that it usually takes time and effort to look
good, and that means you've spent less time on 'the important stuff'.  a lot
of people are going to assume that you're trying to make up for a lack of
skill with a hot outfit.  if you can pull off both...fucking nice :)  rock
it out.  you're the minority.

people like dj rap, kemistry, storm, sandra collins, mistress barbara -
they always look (looked) hot, dress (dressed) hot, when they play.  the way
they look is a bonus.  i'm not going to mention the other side, but they're
there and they're embarrassing.  but they're no more embarrassing than a
shitty male dj who might step up to the tables wearing some glittery cowboy
hat and end up trainwrecking through his set.  the pseudo live pa guy who
tinkers around over a dat is lame.  the pseudo live pa girl who dresses like
a hooker and tinkers around over a dat is lame with bonus reasons to make
fun of her.  that's all.  if you're going to take that unnecessary step to
draw attention to yourself, you'd better have the skill to back it up.
everyone is always going to assume that the most attractive people have the
lowest levels of intelligence.  if you take two hours to get dressed and do
your hair, that's an extra hour and 45 minutes another guy is going to
practice.

> My core belief is that no one can ever avoid labels and stereotypes that
> come from the "outside world",

' if you can't beat them, join them".  but maybe you should leave that up to
the girls themselves.  this sounds more like "if you can't beat them, maybe
the male promoters will help us."  if they want more representation i'm sure
they can put their own event together.

out of curiosity...what's the flyer going to look like ?

grirl,
kelly

Hey Kel, 
We do not assume that female djs absolutely need our support to get rich
and famous, nor do we think they are kept down by the man. We feel like
throwing a party to acknowledge women in electronic music and we are not
ashamed of it- I will not sugarcoat my opinions to avoid conflict from you
or anyone else, so please don't insult me and my crew with your guilt
trips. Those who aren't so holier-than-thou will come as they are, ready
to kickit for kickit's sake. If passing judgement and making
generalizations prevents you from attending or supporting this party, well
then peace the fuggout. 
Euphorix,
Alien G

People used to get confused about which style I was
playing when I would get booked for an event, so I
created a separate name for the D'n'B gigs to help
alleviate the confusion.  

Dionysos = techno, DJ Mythic = D'n'B.  

To be honest this is the first time I've been booked
for both at the same event, so I could see how it
could cross some wires.  I don't think Luke was
intending to mislead anyone.

ive got the original seals and croft version on wax if someone needs to

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} all girl line ups / dj irene is the anti-christ

im just going to comment that i think it speaks volumes about the makeup of
this list that such a huge deal is being made over the all female party, but
when i posted about being offended by the "pitch black" all black deejay
event, no one noticed. you all need to go watch "bamboozled" a few times,
let it sink in.

hey alien,

first off, your name is really really really fucking stupid. thats not my
point at all. for the past few months ive found your comments and ideas have
run the gamut from annoying to stupid, touching all points inbetween. and
now this exploitative rave is just fucking ridiculous. i just wanted you to
know that i really dont like you, and i think you need to quit being such an
idiot.

peace the fuggout,

tom

$20 for this... That's insane.  I wish I wasn't so damn busy that weekend
already, oh well... Now here's something to ponder... The old astrological
visions parties that were all 20 bucks for locals or this... What is a party
worth nowadays?  Why cant we just expect fair prices for parties with good
talent?  FUZE and Groove seem to have no problem keeping their prices down
for their weeklies, so why is it so much more for a party?

Fuze is always cheap because the budget is minimal.

Groove on the other hand, i dont know what you mean by keeping 
their prices down. its $10 on a weekly basis. thats not down, 
thats mighty pricey in my opinion. 
Especially when there are all locals and one guy you never heard 
of playing.

just my opinion,

Having never been to either, I will toss this out merely from my humble =
experiences of weeklies in Dayton/Cincy.  Being that they are both at =
clubs, I'm sure the cost of venue is significantly lower, as well as =
probably little or no added sound or lights.  You don't need the extra =
cost of dance hall permits, etc.  They're also not 20 DJ's in two rooms =
going from 8pm - 6am.  It's usually 4 or 5 great DJ's.  Good weeklies =
are great bang for your buck.

However, for really cheap fun, come to Dayton on Tuesdays to Pimpin' =
Tuesdays.  No cover, damn good talent (Titonton, Eye-D, React and =
Ariel), and open tables downstairs.

I don't see how you guys are bitching about groove.  you know what, I
think groove is awesome.  $10 bux for pretty good sound for the most part,
good djs, and so what if you've never heard of the "headliner" , go check
them out if you want.  When they get the big dawgs yeah they charge more
but think maybe they will break even on that and it will help finance all
the other nights where its only $10 and they might be losing money.  Plus
they pay the locals pretty well too, so I think all around Groove is dope,
and people hoping to get their rave fix on, on a sat night when tehres no
raves going on can go there when they have BBB etc.

quit your bithcing. 

if you don't think these line ups aren't worth $20, then don't go. 
the lineups for most of the afterparties are world class, and that 
talent costs money, never mind hotles, plane ticktes, etc.You 
really can't compare fuze, groove or any other club night to a 
festival afterparty. and since we were trying to organize our own 
afterparty for the festival this year, i know first hand how much 
venue owners wanted to charge promoters. so to borrow a phrase 
from a popular fox tv show, they wanted .....mo money, mo money , 
mo money!!

Okay, so I've been reading about Mayor Jane Campbell's Artists' Summit, and have a few questions running through my head:

1. Did any promoters in the area attend to represent the electronic dance music genre/scene?

2. If not, should they have? If they did, was it a mistake?

3. Is EDM considered to be part of the "arts?" Should it be? Do people consider it to be "entertainment" instead?

4. Should we be involving ourselves more in these kinds of civic matters to get support from local authorities? What about getting grants to support the creative process? Would it help to better the reputation of the scene? Allow more opportunities for better venues? Let clubs stay open later?



"On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;
"No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
"To chase the glowing hours with flying feet."

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Tronic Treatment @ DEMF

I wasn't bitching at all, I think that for 20 bucks it was an insane steal,
Hell, I would pay 40 or 50 to see that lineup, it's worth it... Not
bitching, rather, I was praising the fact that it was so cheap!

Misconstrued thought process,

quit your bithcing. 

if you don't think these line ups aren't worth $20, then don't go. 
the lineups for most of the afterparties are world class, and that 
talent costs money, never mind hotles, plane ticktes, etc.You 
really can't compare fuze, groove or any other club night to a 
festival afterparty. and since we were trying to organize our own 
afterparty for the festival this year, i know first hand how much 
venue owners wanted to charge promoters. so to borrow a phrase 
from a popular fox tv show, they wanted .....mo money, mo money , 
mo money!!

gee, you finally get a substantive, well thought out response to your post 
and you bash it all to hell and back.
guilt trips?  what are you talking about?  too much catholic in your life?

while i would agree that there are some great female djs out there, i would 
rather see a lineup of good talent, not just a lineup of all-this or 
all-that.  make a good lineup of all-good talent and if that just happens 
to be all-female the so much the better.

Thomas,
I am crushed that you wanted me to know that you really don't like me.
Over these past couple months, I've been sitting at home alone....waiting
and longing to hear you tell me that you liked my name and what I've had
to say. I wanted so bad for you to just like me. What's the point of even
living if Thomas Cox thinks I'm annoying and stupid?  Just give me one
more chance. I'll change my name, I'll cancel the party; I'll do ANYTHING
if I knew it might get you to be my best friend.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} More Female DJ crap

apples n oranges. the winner is not playing in an all-female lineup, she's being selected out of an all-female pool. it's different though still somewhat exploitative. perhaps they could have ended the contest with the selection by professional and public jury, then put the winner in a more general lineup. i don't know that i'd want to be the winner of that contest, then have to be paraded around like a beauty pageant queen and give interviews afterwards...

Subject: {pb-cle} regarding misinterpretations of good intention

This is in response to conversation regarding the Powerpuffin' Girls party 
on July 5th.

The proposal of theme and eventual efforts involved in making a Euphorix 
event happen are thoroughly exercised with great importance, notably within 
our proud manner of promotion which highlights the skill to be exhibited by 
the talent showcased. Considerate regards to informing potential attendees 
of these facts are in high regards and prioritzed from the beginning of the 
event's conception, and in effect truly makes gender an inferior issue due 
to the extent of biographical and background information shared within our 
various promotions strategies. The comments that have been shared on the 
list contrast greatly from our stance as professional hosts employing their 
services, and suggest more negative impression than neccesary when we are 
making an truly honest, unbiased effort in supporting their talents for 
others to enjoy.

True, our creative attempts that stem from our abilities are recognized as 
being unusual (Funky Charms, for example... why attempt a full scale event 
with a local lineup, some had questioned), but the intent lies within why 
we're here in the first place: fulfilling our group's collective motivations 
and goal of offering alternatives to the common paint-by-numbers standard, 
as well as hopes to install faith in the growing numbers of the jaded and 
yet to be impressioned.

This party exists FOR the vitality and enlightened observance that makes our 
scene so great, not to mention those who've identified our goals and 
appreciate the active attempt to diversify and expand upon the familiar. The 
reaction of concern that has been voiced is thoughtfully concerned as 
always, but will ultimately be responded to by strengthening the various 
elements that will ultimately secure a fun and impressive experience 
regardless of prejudice. We invite those who attend events for their love of 
the music and support the positive message that surround our events. Respect 
from those of us involved who assure and encourage the headstrong to witness 
and participate in the outcome itself.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} retarding misexpressions of good obfuscation

I didn't really give a shit about this thread a minute ago, but I'm now
compelled to respond the the overly verbose message of one Audio Pilot...

-

{{ Audio Pilot <noizia@hotmail.com> }
The proposal of theme and eventual efforts involved in making a Euphorix
event happen are thoroughly exercised with great importance, notably within
our proud manner of promotion which highlights the skill to be exhibited by
the talent showcased. }}

Spoken like a true politician. You have said absolutely nothing here. It is
also clear that you are attempting to present yourself as being rather glib
and eloquent, but you end up being decidedly prolix. To wit, stop
pussyfooting around and give these conversational carnivores some meat into
which they can sink their proverbial teeth...

-

{{ Audio Pilot <noizia@hotmail.com> }
Considerate regards to informing potential attendees of these facts are in
high regards and prioritzed from the beginning of the event's conception,
and in effect truly makes gender an inferior issue due to the extent of
biographical and background information shared within our various promotions
strategies. }}

Hitherto, it has encircled the "all girl party" motif since the inception of
this thread or family of threads. Trying to soft-pedal the issue once it has
become the focus of discussion is futile.

-

{{ Audio Pilot <noizia@hotmail.com> }
The comments that have been shared on the list contrast greatly from our
stance as professional hosts employing their services, and suggest more
negative impression than neccesary when we are
making an truly honest, unbiased effort in supporting their talents for
others to enjoy. }}

This is indeed the pith of the issue. The impression of your efforts is
anything but unbiased. The predominant opinion about the "all girl" party or
the "all black" party of any other type of event done in the spirit of
"affirmative action" is one of cynicism. Those kinds of things have been so
overshot in western culture that any attempt at imitating such a phenomenon
is seen as being tiresome or even spurious.

-

{{ Audio Pilot <noizia@hotmail.com> }
the intent lies within why we're here in the first place: fulfilling our
group's collective motivations
and goal of offering alternatives to the common paint-by-numbers standard,
as well as hopes to install faith in the growing numbers of the jaded and
yet to be impressioned. }}

The jaded have already been "impressioned" - that's why they're so jaded.
I'd also use this opportunity to reiterate that the female showcase has in
fact become a "paint-by-numbers standard." It has almost become an
institution unto itself, much akin to intellibeams and glowsticks.

-

{{ Audio Pilot <noizia@hotmail.com> }
This party exists FOR the vitality and enlightened observance that makes our
scene so great, not to mention those who've identified our goals and
appreciate the active attempt to diversify and expand upon the familiar. }}

Again, I'd challenge the word "diversify" because there is nothing diverse
about an all female lineup. Things like this stifle diversity.

-

My intent here is not to disrespect, but rather to humbly counter some of
your weaker points. Thank you for participating in the internet community.

Time for a nap,

I love you, Kelly Carter.

Is this considered a "me too" post? Shit!

-

{{ kelly carter <kelly@downlow.net> }
the industry is run by straight women and gay men to a great degree.
definitely not low on the female energy end of things. }}

I would add, then, that the Rave concept (in its purest form) is a
characteristically feminine concept. It is the influence of male dominator
culture that has perverted it into its current dysfunctional state. Where's
the applesauce?

gentlemen and ladies - more quality pb-cle sig file material.  traut, it's
your call.  you should consider doing a signature of the month thing
though.


' there probably was a lot going on in the underground party scene if you
knew where to go.  but to me it just looked like one dodgy club, which
you'd go past and there'd be people eating kebabs and beating each other
up outside.  that was my introduction to english club culture.'

We feel like throwing a party to acknowledge women in electronic music

I bet it's gonna be the same ole local female DJs that get booked around 
here all the time anyway. i'd give you all mad props if you spent some 
cash and brought some female headliners, especially ones that haven't 
been around here all that much before, but somehow I don't think it's 
gonna happen.

We're not particularly influenced by the previous attempts that have been 
made at this sort of theme in the market, only to the positive perception of 
those who'll attend and promotional advantage and consideration that the 
performers will be receptive of.


the female showcase has in

In regards to any previous references of this issue, the scale of production 
and amount of talent performing is what we are aiming to surpass; this is 
where we felt a certain sense of attraction and attention could be acheived.


I'd challenge the word "diversify" because there is nothing diverse
>about an all female lineup.

My use of the term was in reference to exercising our goals with ideas on a 
scale that we haven't seen before.

Thanks for your time in responding. Sorry to be be brief, but the weekend 
calls...

This is why I refrain from going into great detail on certain things. I 
always come across to others as sounding like a nerd!

I'd like to know exactly what words you had problems with in his post. I
didn't see anything in there that went beyond an 8th grade reading level.
The name of the rave was probably the hardest word there.

Of course people don't talk like that: spoken word by its nature takes a
different form than written text. But what he wrote wasn't far off from
how a lot of people I know speak, and they don't spend their time "making
speeches all day".

I mean, c'mon people: just because w3'r3 4ll l33t h4x0rz d00dz doesn't mean
it makes any sense to rip on people who dare to use words with more than
two syllables in them.

Yeah, I remember...
It was the skit with Damon Wayans talking to that little boy...
I can't remember exactly what he said, I think he was either going off about oppression in big 'adult' terms, or else women... not sure.  But he got the kid to start talking like him too... Either way, he wasn't making any sense.

pain.

it took a couple minutes for anybody to help me too because everyone =

my ligament is completely torn and there's a bone fracture in my knee =

Trout went ahead and perverted my quote to only say "where's the
applesauce?" This doesn't capture the irony of the male dominator comment
because the applesauce comment was a reference to Hookers on Ice, a very
clear manifestation of male dominator values imposed upon rave culture. It's
kind of like the idea of Kosher hot dogs; I mean, what the fuck is that?

Of course, I'm just being a little fucking bitch right now. I'm so oppressed
that I must be Asian. I still enjoy the idea of lesbian sluts naked in a vat
of MottsT (if they're hot), but I'm certainly not prepared to call it a
rave. Given the opportunity, I would probably lick applesauce out of
Xe54.Holly's poophole.

This shit is definitely OT, but it's time for bed because I'm a hardcore
all-night raver type.

BOTH...

It was full of action, exciting, beautiful, and more.

What it did lack in acting and plot development...it
MORE then made up for in action, scenery, special
effects, sound, emotion, action, sound, Portman's
tummy....and the ending fight scene. 

Try not listening to the asshole critics and let
yourself enjoy this.

What action?

I fought to keep awake for the first hour and a half of the movie. And what 
action there was... I mean that whole scene in that  droid facility? What 
was the point of that? Seemed like an excuse JUST to put action in there.

Computer graphics weren't anything I haven't seen before, and they 
are/were/will be way overused. Lucas definitely throws all of his money into 
making everything look nice and pretty (and utterly fake and stupid) as 
opposed to - plot, acting, directing, and anything else that makes a good 
movie a good movie. I thought I was playing Jedi Knight II. The entire thing 
was filmed in front of a blue screen, we were lucky to even see the 
characters interact with something other than a cartoon.

Emotion? There was none. You can't have emotion when the actors are making 
sure they are standing at point X rather than playing a part with feeling. 
Anakin Skywalker was the biggest freakin pussy ass I have ever seen.

Ending jedi battle was completely ruined when Yoda started flying around 
like a freakin tree monkey. Way to ruin a badass character by making him 
bounce around like a beach ball on crack.

Natalie Portman's tummy did look good, much better than that freakin moron 
with the eye patch.

Just my opinions though, lots of people seemed to have enjoyed it and thats 
cool. It honestly made me feel sick to my stomach.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} nrr - attack of the clones...

It was the best Star Wars yet! People have to understand though that it
IS a kids movie! Yeah, some of the shit is dumbed up so the kids
understand what's going on! Why do you think there are so many Star Wars
toys and shit for it???

The special effects were as good as they get!! The one thing you can
always count on from George Lucus, is the best special effects, highest
quality video and sound! He prides himself on that shit, and even has
his own sound quality certification, "THX." And he also own Industrial
Light and Magic, which almost every other film made hires to do the
special effects... and you know he saves the good shit for Star Wars! 

Star Wars has always been cheesy, with now classic, cheesy lines, "I've
got a bad feeling about this!" and "May the force be with you." And has
always had the C3po and R2 as the stereotypical clueless and witty duo.
Every movie R2D2 will save the day somehow with his little spinner
thing.

I guess if you don't like that type of shit, or tolerate it, then you
don't like Star Wars period! All the movies have been that way, but have
had the most cutting edge special effects, and characters and shit. 

Noone has ever done what Lucus has in creating all those worlds, and
making a saga like he has. People need to pick up Phantom Menace on DVD,
and watch the making of... You get to see George Lucus's day to day
activities, and what he goes through to make the movie. No other
filmmaker does what he does, period.

     i'd also recommend not listening to all that
    clay bertrand has to say as well.

    go with an open mind and expect nothing.

    disappointment is the difference between 
    expectations and reality.

    i am glad that i saw the movie on the big screen
    and i personally enjoyed it. however, i wasn't
    expecting anything in particular out of the movie.

    there are a number of people who though the
    movie sucked. i have to wonder if you were
    major star wars fans growing up or something.
    i thought george lucus redeemed himself fairly
    well after the phantom mentace.

    i don't remember this much critcism after phantom
    mentace and i thought episode 2 was much better
    than the first.

    anyway, how was spiderman?

    i don't know why this would be a question for
    a pittsburgh - cleveland raves list.

    i don't know diddly about bucky and snert except 
    for the fact they send too much fucking spam.

    and also, i think bucky and snert are pretty stupid
    names.

    that's about all i have to say.

    here's another one..

    where is this party? it's got a 703 area code.

    i see the zelch brothers are playing, so i guess
    that makes it a pubicle sort of party, or something.

    oh well, pittsburgh and cleveland have nothing
    going on, so why not post parties within an 8 hour
    driving distance.

    blah, this may weather sucks!

Nothing is ever 100% shade free. It would suck if it
was. Just make sure if you go, to wear your shades :]

Subject: {pb-cle} Belt drive speakers?




I want a few of these:
http://www.servodrive.com/servo/bt7.shtml
Servo driven loudspeakers.. I had that idea a while ago, but I couldn't 
figure out how it could be done.  Well, these guys figured it out way before 
it even occured to me.. I just didn't realize it.

And of course, for my home system, these would be nice:
http://www.codrive.com/bassp.htm

The CoDrive people say they are creating pro sound subwoofers in their 
'secret labs.'  Seems like a good concept.. I wish they would sell drivers 
by themselves, though.  Oh well...

i was irratated all nite by morons, from sum guy getting head in the girls
bathroom, to idiots standing and chatting in stairwells/small hallways...
and i wanted to jam whistles down throats...
and again, white boys should not mc.

highlights: 15min of speedcore i heard, 10min of dnb, chattin with jes and
watching her get soaked :)

Sorry to all. 2 weeks ago a few people, including myself tried to post to=
 the regional board about the event being 18 and over and not 16, only to=
 have the post deleted or bashed. Several promoters have had a long term =
relationship with the venue, which by the way rocks and have always known=
 it to be 18 and over for this type event. Even when they took he venue a=
nd flyers were done over 4 weeks ago, it still said 16 and over. I have n=
o idea what they were thinking by doing this and I know they were told at=
 their first meeting the bottom line about the rules of the venue...So th=
at may remain unanswered. I just want to apologize that some of us forgot=
 to post this to this list since we never assumed kids from Pitts would o=
f been there. I hear about 20-30 were turned away from your area due to a=
ge... Once again sorry. The venue rocks and other promoters do not want t=
his to reflect upon them when they utilize it in the future for this acti=
on.

Hahaha, well I don't know what you're like when you're drunk (though I can
imagine) but I know I'm gonna be causing some trouble.  Last night I got
drunk and played twister with myself...I think that was the highlight of the
evening...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} review on{pb-cle} tonite in cleveland

lets see...

last night some girl pissed me off with some flyers she had.. (long story)
so i dumped them on the floor to show her how much i cared about her
attitude..

then later that night she puts them back up for me to throw down again..
thats when i wanted to not be so harsh and put them to actual use, and make
paper airplanes to throw at her. Oh yea, she left her clothes behind the bar
too, and i told her i lost it.. cocky
b-itch.  Thanks to VR, he refreshed my memory on how to make the airplanes..
After that we decided to save some airplanes to throw off the balcony of the
eagles nest, which we did, but that lead to Nick (Gary Condit) throwing ice
off the balcony, but that was my idea..   not to mention him screaming at
everyone being crazy...  i think we scared VR.. haha..    Afrocore loves me
man..  i swear i cause them trouble all the time..
they came up and we basically got in trouble..    i felt bad after that
tho..

later that night, someone decided to put ice down my pants, so my conclusion
of the story was to get pitchers of water, to throw at everyone behind the
bar. that lead to beer, and red bull fights.. which lead to everyone teaming
up on me..    im glad i brought some clothes man.. ugh.

after all that...  i got to be super drunk, and kicked everyone out at 6am.
somethings are popping up as they come, plus im still getting some phone
calls from friends telling me some other things i did, that i didnt really
remember.

jes

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} reid speed... interesting


I'm rpetty sure it's a normal mix CD.. I read a review of it in some 
magazine at Barnes and Noble, and they said it was good technically and it 
had a spectacular track selection... I think it was the highest rated album 
they reviewed..

Not sure which mag, though.. Musik, maybe?

Right.. mixer gave it a 9, but mixer is also promoting her tour,
interesting?

The track selection seems pretty mediocre in my opinion, but I haven't
heard the actual CD yet.

Yeah, the bitch's agent wanted 1500 for her to play at cook da goose cause
she knew her tour was 'gonna blow up' after her cd release.  Even after I
explained the event was free and it was something to give back... I had even
offered to pay for her airplane ticket from new york, food while she was in
town, and hotel room.  I understand making your living off deejaying is some
people's way of life, but when she didn't have anything booked that weekend,
kinda left a salty taste in my mouth as to her true intentions.  It's all
about that bling bling I guess.  Remind me never to get an agent.  Playing
for free food and gas will always be plenty for me...

Right.. mixer gave it a 9, but mixer is also promoting her tour,
interesting?

The track selection seems pretty mediocre in my opinion, but I haven't heard
the actual CD yet.

digital juice is searching for instrumental type music (ie electronica) for

agreed

on of my favorite records of all time : Drexciya- the journey home 
(warp) stellar stuff!

akufen's album is dropping this week, and from what i've heard 
thus far it's the shit! and for those of you who don't actually 
buy music you know who you are;) check out his live set on 
www.klubradio.de for your downloading pleasure.

also check recloose's new album, on planet e/k7 and the entire 
emoticon catalog (www.emoticonrecordings.com), I haven't been this 
impressed by a label in a very long time, every record they've 
released thus far has been top notch. and the latest release: 
scape one: fuzzy soda ep, is an electro masterpiece!

Jwan

bsp: portion of the message

"tuesday" my latest live mix cd was completed recently, and as 
soon as I have it duplicated, i'll be giving copies away at milk 
records.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} some of the dopest jungle that i just totally forgot about for no reason

listen to some klute...
the new joint from klute and john tejada is a lot more detroit vs 
london than omni trio I think... as is a lot of klute's stuff.

polar/k is also an incredibly innovative producer.

these guys constantly come through with innovative tracks, unlike 
many many other dnb producers who either never come up with 
anything new, or come up with something new and then re-hash that 
for all the $$ they can.

still wondering what comes up in the end.....

Subject: {pb-cle} Rob Black set

Hy, 
	Does anyone know the which remix of War - Lowrider that Rob
Black played on his wish set (I heard it Saturday on 92.3)? It was
definitely cool, and I cant find it on audiogalaxy (narrowed it down
from it NOT being Mellow Trax vs War remix (though I like his remix of
it too)). 	
	Usually some of his tracks are too commercial for me, but then
again he's getting airplay and sending "techno" to the masses, right?
Danks,
Alex tweak

Your complaining about tracks being too commercial and you want that one?
I made fun of him all day for picking that rubbish up.... check yourself :-)

It was indeed mellow trax vs war on EDM.

and rob, who is standing beside me, says that is the most commerical track
he plays.

If butt pumping trance/hard house remakes of old cheesy tracks aren't
considered commercial, then I am confused.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Rob Black set

Mellow trax is the shit... I used to play 'alpha' all the time at high
volumes to piss off the neighbors... I think the other cool tracks were
'future vibes', 'psychopath' and of course, the played out 'outer space'

Your complaining about tracks being too commercial and you want that one? I
made fun of him all day for picking that rubbish up.... check yourself :-)

It was indeed mellow trax vs war on EDM.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rob Black set

the same tracks that will get played at a "party"  - NEXT YEAR -  by the
flavor of the month dj that everyone new to the scene thinks is a superstar
underground dj.  Every style of dj has his place... there are those who
constantly break and play new records, and there are those who copy them and
reap the rewards.  One day all the hating will stop, and people will see
what is what.

I mean... it is debatable... but rob believes he can't sacrifcie the flow of
his club to constantly play new music.  if it were a radio show without
regard to a nightclub -- it would be an entirely different story.  while it
is in the club, most of the new stuff gets broken before and after the time
which he is on air.  the time on air happens to co-inside with the peak rush
where in a club the crowd needs to hear something familiar.  if you pay
closer attention to that show, elminate the stuff you already know, you will
see what i mean.  you will also notice that he intentionally drops one of
the "anthems" every week and replaces it with a new one.  He also plays many
new records in that rotation every week.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to stick up for rob... I would like
to see the radio expose more of what is out there.   I think we need to show
support for what we have and push forward.   There are quite a few area djs
who don't get any of the exposure that they should... but for now be
thankful you aren't listening to one of the "superstars"  who plays last
years tracks and still tries to get a residency.

that album is so good it hurts...especially 'deck the house'.  akufen is my
favorite new artist.  his music is such a kick in the ass to all the clicky
dubby shite that has lost the funk over the last few years.  it goes to show
that IDM can be fun too.

i haven't gotten this one in the mail yet, but from the sound clips i heard
this will be one of the best records to come out of detroit this year.

So, I was pondering cheesy music and remixes and such, and came to this =
conclusion:

The ultimate would be to hear a dnb remix of "It's Not Unusual" by Tom =
Jones.

Either that, or a clubby house remix of "Desperado" by The Eagles.

Anyway, another request would be a hard house track utilizing a guitar =

That would be Huey Lewis & The News. And yes, I'd pay good money to be
somewhere that spun that.

 No not this year.  They were trying to get something together but opted against it due to heavy afterhours competition because of the weak demf lineup.  Im trying to talk them into coming to Ohio for an electro event (anyone wanna get in on this investor wise, contact me) Im attempting to get together but they seem to have something against Ohio for some reason.  Maybe they have warrants or something.  They do plan on doing something in the Detroit area sometime soon though.

Ok all, y'all.....laugh at me if you will, but I am here alone attempting to change my car stereo (yay!  I finally will have more than just the radio!!!) but anyways, I have never done anything like this and am trying to get the stereo out, I am almost there.  I encountered 2 screw type things(not philips, not flat head) they don't have a place to use a screw driver and they are placed such that I can not use a wrench.  How do I get them out?  I have my father's workshop full of tools, so just give me a good description of what to look for......pretty please!!!!I think I will be fine with it, once I get passed this little roadblock.  Thanks, all tips are welcomed and appreciated!

no doubt, i really enjoyed ep2 over ep1 .. at least 10 times better.  some
of the scenes were over done with computer animation or backgrounds which
stood out and were more of an eyesore to me than anything .. but i imagine
it would look awesome with a digital projection system.  and what's up with
the beasts in the arena scene?  the jedi were so un-zen, i was very
disappointed.  though the critic in me found flaws, yoda's scene really did
kick.  i think the whole jango fett fight sequence was my favorite part of
the movie.

spider-man rocked out, i want to see it again.  willem dafoe is perfect for
the roll of the green goblin.  i was surprised with tobey maguire, he did
much better than i expected.  kirsten dunst wasn't all that and i wasn't at
all surprised there .. some of her lines had entirely no 'umpf' to them.
once again i am happy to say that sam raimi is the man.  i'm really looking
forward to the next one (which raimi is doing as well).

yes, the droid factory scene was really irritating .. seriously.

i think he did well in specific scenes where he needed to project the creepy
and sinister fall from grace into the dark side.  he was -supposed- to be
whiney, reckless, and insubordinate.

it was a little far out there, but i still think it was good.  what i
really, really hated was the jedi involvement with the clones .. it was too
smooth of a transition with them.  what, not one of them had precognition
enough to know that what they're doing is dangerous for them?  i mean sure,
they always have difficulty with seeing the future because of the dark side.
however, on that note, i wish lucas had explained the sith a little more
this time around .. mystery is nice and all, but bah.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rob Black set

I've been recording those mixes ever since the first broadcast and 
only have missed a couple.  It's practically all automated now, just 
have to hook up PC to radio and make sure it's on the right station 
before I head out for the night.  I actually have an FM tuner for my 
computer that I haven't messed with, but then Iwould just have to 
make sure the computer is on and I'd be set :)  Anywhoo, the latest 
mixes can be found at http://vrillusions.dyndns.org:888/xtrnl/  I try 
to get the latest mix up there the next day or so and I leave the 
last 2 or 3 up there.

it's only on RR, so don't complain if it's slow :)

ive played huey lewis and the news records at raves before. and genesis/phil
collins. you cant fuck with my selection dropped at andythepooh's rave or
the night i played upstairs at metropol during atomic. drunk pittsburgh
chicks are ready for "strangelove" by depeche mode, and theyre even ready
for the "ready or not" acapella by the fugeees dropped over an instrumental
by dj shadow from the quannum spectrum LP. but theyre not ever ready for
fripp + eno's "an index of metals" or "timesteps" by walter carlos.

Your hip to quannum..  can i steal that LP?.  I have it here with  vocals
and everything. I want INSTRUMENTS..  dammit.

Id say "Storm Warning" is by far the best track on the album.

:i: still jam out to Quannum..

> listen to some klute...

ah yeah, i do love the klute as well, i even bought the "fear of people" LP
on vinyl and cd, plus all the techno tracks from the CD on the 12" release
they got. hes good, but my main problem with him is that he uses the same
couple of synths on every track, and you can so totally tell and its kind of
annoying.

eh, he's got that detroit feel in there, but check omni trio's "nu-birth
(relick)" or "twin town karakoke" or really anything especially off not the
most recent LP but the one before that. and 4 hero definitely have more
techno sounds in them than any of the drum and  bass stuff. their "creating
patterns" LP owns my soul. i do really wanna hear tejada's drum and bass
business.

i dont necessarily think that their stuff is all that "innovative", since
these guys in particular do rip off alot of detroit sounds, but the thing is
that the music from detroit for the most part relies heavily on synthesized
melodies, and that kind of music is just more timeless than a grating drummy
rythmic track. so these tunes are better, and stay good longer than the
other tracks. the last year i spun jungle, that "nu-birth" track by omni
trio and "the way you make me feel" by marcus intallex never left my record
box, not even for a second. those borrowed heavily from detroit and chicago.

i think you can still find the instrumentals on CD and LP if you look hard
enough, try www.turntablelab.com i think it is.

thats a good one, it made it on the dope hiphop tape in my car. i really
like the first track with J5, and the divine styler track, and the
blackalicious tracks, and well, basically every track on there.

its not rave related, but i want to make it rave related. :P

there's this song by some girl ive been hearing on the radio lately, and =
every time they play it, they never mention who sings it.

the chorus part it something like

"...and im not built like a super model but i learn to love myself =
unconditionally, because i am a queen...."

When I saw her in LA I was HARDLY disappointed. She rocked the roof off. And her Spundae party at WMC rocked, too. But you're not the first to say they weren't moved. Anyway, also want to turn out and support what's going on my own back yard.

 Anyone want to meet up somewhere?. Say in front of the fountain on Saturday or Sunday around 4:00pm, or whatever time is cool.. I don't have a  lineup infront of me so I don't know who's spinning then.. Just a thought!

Ive been downloading and listening to Enigma alot lately for some odd =
reason. Its rather chill in some cases, but they also have some tracks =
that seem cheesy.

I think my most fav one ive downloaded was    "Between Mind and Heart"

can you find tracks like this on vinyl still?. I never really thought =
about it.

 So Tom,  I guess that means you will definitly be there :)
For anyone who wants to meet, how does 5:00 PM Sunday sound, in front of the fountain... Plus for anyone interested I am sure there will be parties in the Ren Cen after the festival shuts down.. People should come on up and get even more liquored up and mingle before heading to the official afterparties... Oh boy this weekend is gonna be fun..

I've never looked too hard for the vinyle because I always thought Enigma
was a bit too mainstream, commercial.  It can be rather cheesy, but overall
I believe it's good mood music.

Finding some of the older stuff is difficult, although every now and then
Ebay has a couple of real gems..  The most popular song you're going to find
are remixes of "Gravity of Love" from their most recent album.  Some of the
remixes I have on wax are pretty good and tend to get folks at house parties
moving.  It is a good song, but it, like the album as a whole, doesn't have
quite the same feeling as the earlier works.  I beleve this is mostly due to
the fact that the female vocalist on the fourth album, Ruth-Ann Boyle from
Olive, has a more commercial and "pop" feel than the the vocalist from the
first three albums, whose name currently eludes me.  Maybe it's something
about the accent... I dunno.

Oh well, more than you asked for and probably wanted to know.  It's just
that I've been a fan of Cretu for as long as I can remember and was one of
the influences that brought me to eletronic music in my late junior high
years.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rob Black set

Well said, Doug!  The economic reality is that a club coupled with a live 
radio broadcast needs constancy and a bit of familiarity in order to 
maintain viable.  Rob's doing a great job, and still exposing a few gems at 
the same time...

Subject: {pb-cle} <INFECTIOUS RADIO!>Sunrize/DJ Tronic/DJ Reese! LIVE Tonight!  .bsp.



Coming off an insane marathon broadcast from this past weekend
Infectious is back! This week we'll try to get it right, unlike last
week's failed broadcast due to Pac Bell issues.  This week on
Infectious, we will feature America's hottest  happy hardcore
producer, along with two of our well known residents for your
listening enjoyment. No gimmicks this week (well, except for DJ PRANK
CALLS!), just straight up music!

**TUNE IN @ http://www.liquidvinyldjs.com/live.pls

On WEDNESDAY night, 5/22/02, INFECTIOUS will feature the following
lineup:

6:00pm - 7:00pm (9:00pm - 10:00pm EST):

DJ Reese (Liquidvinyldjs.com, SF):

In our regular rotation is our co-founder, always bringing you the
finest in new hardcore every week. Let him know how he's doing during
the set! Expect to hear some tunes from his forthcoming mix CD!

7:00pm - 8:00pm (10:00pm - 11:00pm EST):

Sunrize (SC Hardcore, Pitched Up, Rave'N Beats USA; Pittsburgh, PA):

Right now, no happy hardcore producer in the USA is hotter than this
guy. With upcoming releases like "Memories" (Pitched Up
Recordings), "Dream Forever" (Rave'N Beats USA), and "Still Love U"
(Rave'N Beats USA), he is quickly making his mark as both a talented
DJ and composer. He's put together a slammin set featuring some of
his music, so make sure you're in tune for the future!

8:00pm - 9:00pm (11:00pm - 12:00am EST):

DJ Tronic (Liquidvinyldjs.com, Resistance Recordings; SF):

Now that his schedule has slowed a bit after setting up his first
release on his new label, Tronic is comin at'cha again to bang that
U.S. hard house into your dome! Expect a gabber tune or two as well,
as he always keeps you on your toes!

**Tune in at: http://www.liquidvinyldjs.com/live.pls ! ... or... if
that doesn't work.. try this: http://mp3stream.halogen.org/cgi-
bin/nph-listing and click on the *INFECTIOUS!* Link!

**We are on the AIM Instant Message System.. you can reach us
throughout the show at:

AIM: happycore510 or Infectious510

As always, we will be doing our usual giveaways, shout outs,
dedications and a bunch of other random stuff throughout the
broadcast. Expect the good times that we've brought you in the past!

**Much thanks to the Halogen Radio Network for the space! Visit them
at http://www.halogen.org !

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Rob Black set

	Yah, I totally understand why he plays what he plays, so I
wasn=92t dissin him in any way, cuz you cant expect one of the hottest
stations in Cleveland allow someone to come on and play like speed
garage or gabber (<<--I'd like to see that)[or even just new no-name
traxxx], since its not as appealing to the majority of the public as
perhaps trance or house. I don=92t care how "extreme" they are, people
wouldn=92t be tuning in and they lose $$. Though it is also true there =
is
a lot of stuff I could do without hearing every Saturday (*cough cough
Sandstorm or Ian van Dahl*), but his set is well worth listening too in
comparison to "Club Kiss"...now that=92s cheese to the 4th.
	Thanx also, I downloaded the A side part 2, it obviously must be
part 1 or on side B ;-) Do you guys have it in stock at Puh Bas, it=92s =
a
pretty cool remix (just because I love the original and Mellow Trax)?
Danks agen,
Alex tweak

P.s. Didn=92t rob graduate from Strongsville? This girl I know with used
to know (of) him when he went here. Tomorrow is also last day for
seniors (I'm not a senior, but looking forward to a few pranks :-p)...

Your complaining about tracks being too commercial and you want that

It was indeed mellow trax vs war on EDM.

thats pop music, they play it on b-94. that shouldnt even count as club or
dance music, i dont care how long deejays were playing them before they were

That or "Tresor meets Mantovanni"

Anyway, another request would be a hard house track utilizing a guitar

  So, I was pondering cheesy music and remixes and such, and came to this
conclusion:

  The ultimate would be to hear a dnb remix of "It's Not Unusual" by Tom
Jones.

  Either that, or a clubby house remix of "Desperado" by The Eagles.

<snip>
stations in Cleveland allow someone to come on and play like speed
garage or gabber (<<--I'd like to see that)[or even just new no-name

Gabber, no, but speed garage was a very commercial format.  Janet Jackson
and Puff Daddy all had speed garage remixes, and had 96.5 a mixshow in that
era you would have heard it on there.


<snip>
part 1 or on side B ;-) Do you guys have it in stock at Puh Bas, it's a
pretty cool remix (just because I love the original and Mellow Trax)?

The first week, there were listings for two seperate 12" with different
mixes, but one of them did not come in.
This week, we got another version (not on colored vinyl) wich rob says is
the same as his.  It  should be back in stock on friday.

<snip>
P.s. Didn't rob graduate from Strongsville? This girl I know with used
to know (of) him when he went here. Tomorrow is also last day for
<snip>

Rob graduated in 1990, but I don't what high school he went to.  You can
email him at black@visn.net

Your complaining about tracks being too commercial and you want that

wouldn't gabber be much more approprate for the "extreme" radio station?

pussy trance isn't very extreme at all...*well unless you count how it makes
me extremely ill*
but neither is anything else they play on the station...

i've caught bootyhouse/ghetto tech on 107.9, "blazin hip-hop and r&b" a

Subject: {pb-cle} Groove is moving...

If anybody has not heard the rumor that Groove is moving yet... you have
now. And its true!! :)
We are very excited about the change.

We have our final meeting on Friday to lock down the new club. I will let
you know how it goes and the details asap. I can tell you right now that
the rules will be a bit different. The biggest one being that it will be
18 and over.

Also Twin Productions will be bringing headliners to Rock Jungle the last
Friday of every month. The first one is FRANKIE BONES on June 29th. Wizard
Workshop will be providing the sound.

We do ask that you continue to support the night Laga... EAST COAST
BOOGIEMEN this Friday on 6 decks. These guys are definitely something not
to be missed.

Peace
Twin Productions

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rob Black set

I don't know much about how things work, but why does it seem necessary for 
DJ's to spin anthems? Why do the crowds 'need' to hear something familiar?

It's easier to dance to something you already know, for one thing.  Also, if 
the majority of the crowd already has good associations with a particular 
song, playing it will bring back all those good associations.  That's part 
of what music is about..

Of course, I tend to enjoy the excitement of hearing something new about as 
much if not more than the joy from anthem-enticed memories. :)

What I really hate is dropping the needle on something brand new with an
"athemish" feel and having people come up to me afterwards give me shit
about why I played an anthem.  Maybe it's just because it all sounds the
same after awhile. :)

Count me as at least a lone vote for the opposite. I like their earlier
stuff, but after they came out with their last album, "The Screen Behind
The Mirror", I haven't been able to put back on any of their older ones, as
much as I still do like them. "Push the Limits" just floors me every time
I hear it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Rob Black set

Funny, BC and I were talking about something similar
tonight - at least with regards to different styles of djs
and how they play.

In this discussion you need to define what an athem is.
While many trance tracks are described as "anthematic", they
do not reach anthem status until they are well known.  At
least that is my opinion.  So an anthem is synonymous with a
"hit".

Now you have to look at these hits.  There are hits in the
commercial sense.  There are hits which are regional.  There
are hits which are global.  And, most importantly, any good
dj developes his own hits/anthems.  Then again not all djs
play anthems, but if you are a dj with a "signature"
track... that is still one of your anthems.

This is where I get confused and need go get some sleep... I
have a hard time explaining the rest of this.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

the double-stuff foam machines.  Tonight is the first one of the year — 
don’t be a sitting duck and miss out on the fun!

5" Taint is an established crew in the greater Washington, DC area.  5" 
Taint was founded by Jason Plank (nooch) and Timothy Hilke with a mindset 
that they would support most genres of Electronic Music (House, Techno, 2 
Step, D'N'B, and UK Hard House are currently supported).   5" Taint held 
one of the most successful weekday weekly parties in the metro area last 
year and helped organize and present "United We Stand 2001" (along with 
4Twenty4 and Stellar), a charity event whose proceeds went to the Red 
Cross to help the victims of the September 11th attack on America.  On 
their plate this year they have two weeklies:  one a Tuesday night party 
in Sterling, and the other, a Saturday night weekly named Stereo which 
begins Saturday, June 22nd.  For more information on 5" Taint check out

"Comedy Tragedy" to his works today - which included work on the
soundtrack for Ralph Nader's Presidential Campaign, Woody continues to be
one of the techno's brightest stars. www.djesp.com. TECHNO AND ACID HOUSE

PAUL BIRKEN : Tone Wrecker : Catalyst : Minneapolis, MN : LIVE P.A. Paul
is an International techno hero, as if you didn't know by now. Starting
with his acidic Son of Gonzo releases in the mid-90's, up to the
launching of his own label, Birken has always worked his ass off to get
people groovin. His records on Communique (that's Woody McBride's label)
have sold out here and in Europe and it's our pleasure to bring you one
of the world's finest dj/producers. www.ToneWrecker.com TECHNO/LIVE PA

DJ DRAGON : N'Telligence Recordings : Denver, CO : Well our buddy Dragon
tore it up so much at Phreaky Deaky 1, we just had to bring him back.

shaken not stirred. www.DJ-DRAGON.com EPIC TRANCE

Birken, Matt always pleases with his head-bobbing sounds. HARD HOUSE

ALI OBVIOUS : Bounce Theory : Dayton, OH : Dana has been at the forefront
of the Ohio drum and bass and jungle movement from the beginning. He's
teamed with Bounce Theory to bring some of the best events ever to the
Midwest and will be bringing a full crate of the sickest beats around.

Fri Jun 07                SHIMON & ANDY C @ groove               Pittsburgh

Friday June 7th 2002
Pittsburgh PA

Red Tape Productions Presents


SHIMON & ANDY C.
   Live @ Groove


Featuring:

ANDY C.     Ram Records, Liftin Spirits, Uk

The Chiefs in charge of the entire Ram Operation are, as you should know 
by now, none other than Andy C. and Ant Miles.  Ram Records kicked off in 
early ’92 with Andy’s now highly collectable “Sour Mash” EP. Around this 
time, Ant was expecting his first child, forcing Andy to go solo on such 
singles as “Bass Logic” and “Elevation” in ’93. Once Ant got back in the 
studio, the bond known as “Origin Unknown” blew up with the classic EP 
“Valley of the Shadows”. RAM Records reputation only grew, especially 
after the track won Best Hardcore Tune at the 1993 Hardcore Dance Awards; 
as well Andy received the award for ‘Best Newcomer). In ’94 and ’95, work 
came thick and fast for Origin Unknown with tracks like “Truly One” and 
“Cool Down”. Threw various alias’, the duo released timepiece tunes such 
as “Beyond Bass” and “Here and Now”. Around this time, Andy hooked up with 
Randall to create “the Sound Control” 12”.  Andy also found himself DJing 
at major bashes such as Innovation, Desire, Dreamscape and Jungle Fever. 
Around ’96, Andy hooked up with Shimon to create “Quest” and “Nightflight” 
that took their names to greater acclaim.  1997 marked a new Era in Ram 
history as Andy C. & Shimon’s tracks “Recharge” and “Quest VIP” hit 
worldwide markets, bringing them the award for ‘Best Album’ at the 1996 
Hardcore Dance Awards; Andy received ‘Best Producer’.  In 1998, the birth 
of Ram Trilogy marked three classic EP’s, with this Andy went on to host 
London’s Kiss FM as well as performing at Ram Sessions at the End, 
Movement, Helter Skelter, Metalheadz, Warning, One Nation and other 
locations all around the world, bringing him the Status as ‘Best Dj’ at 
the 1999 Knowledge Awards.  



SHIMON  Ram Records, Liftin Spirits, Uk

You cannot mention the name Shimon without the images of his long time 
compatriots, Andy C and Ant Miles, instantly filtering into the same 
picture. Although the outline of Shimon is often blurred by the notoriety 
of his Ram Trilogy clique, he remains one of the primary colours of the 
Ram Records rainbow, and is very much an individual. Certain DJ's and 
producers within our scene have attained celebrity-like statuses through 
their outstanding and revolutionary work. Due to this it becomes 
increasingly difficult not to herald them on the lofty platform from which 
their achievements derive, and harder to converse with them on a level 
that does not smack of inferiority. Talking to Shimon helps to ignite the 
set stereotypes that have evolved from the upper tier of drum and bass; 
quashing any preconceived notions of a fixed social hierarchy in an 
instant. Requesting an interview from him can be paralleled to asking any 
one of the smiley faced, enthusiastic junglists you associate with your 
typical rave for a bottle of water; such is the honesty and enthusiasm of 
his reply.



MC GQ        Emcee Recordings, UK

MC GQ has been a figurehead and spokesman for the scene for years. 
Originally GQ was most known as the voice of the legendary AWOL, at the 
Paradise Club. Since then he has evolved in stature, becoming quite 
possibly, the most well respected and requested MC in his field.
Through the years he's broadened his horizons, venturing world wide, 
representing and promoting the cause. With a view to the future, he is 
currently establishing his record label 'Emcee Recordings', which is 
striving to encompass the entire spectrum of Drum 'n' Bass. 
Randall, Andy, Hype, Bailey - they all make him work differently. He tries 
to switch his style to read the music, "All the DJ's give you different 
energy". To GQ the inspiration comes from everywhere, It would be 
impossible to narrow it down to any particular source. Music inspires 
everyone, so listen and understand...

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight - Club Havana 05.23

Thursdays at Havana
Tonight 05.23.02

After the 'big' Maxim Magazine / Bud Light (blah) bash at the Zoo Aquarium 
last night, I think I've had my share of bad mixing and hip hop.  (Don't get 
me wrong, I like Hip Hop but I heard enough P. Diddy last night to last me a 
lifetime)  I am so ready for a night of house, breaks and techno.

10pm - DC Space - Deep house grooves
11pm - Clevr - You know, breaks and more breaks.
12am - DJ Society - Playing one hour to warm-up the Detroit crowd and one 
hour to please the San Fran crowd.

100% free, no cover, 21+ ID Required
Drink Special: $2 Yuengling
Back Patio Open (cross your fingers)

See you in Detroit,

Jason C.
Club Havana
5744 Ellsworth Avenue
Pittsburgh (Shadyside) PA 15232
412 661 2025

Upcoming DJs:

05.30  Bassclown and Bedlam

06.20  Darby and DJ Society

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} zoo

> After the 'big' Maxim Magazine / Bud Light (blah) bash at the 
Zoo Aquarium last night, I think I've had my share of bad mixing 
and hip hop.  (Don't get me wrong, I like Hip Hop but I heard 
enough P. Diddy last night to last me a lifetime)  I am so ready 
for a night of house, breaks and techno.

Hahaha.... it was the wierdest thing, last night @ the BBT a whole 
bunch of hot girls showed up later in the night.  And not that 
there aren't hot girls @ the BBT ever, but they certaintly aren't 
in abundance.  Anyhow, we were trying to figure out why, and 
someone somehow came the conclusion they all came from that 
party.  It made so much sense :)

Supposedly one of the girls was from the April issue of 
Penthouse... anyone have a copy??

its gonna be on this Sunday night. i hope to see you all there.

if you didnt go to jak last year, you fucking missed out on the 
best rave ever in the history of mankind.

imagine Integral times 50 in a room about the size of a large 
lecture hall and you begin to get an idea of what it was like. the 
crowd was perfect too. the energy  could only be measured on the 
richter scale...new limits in partying were being broken. it was 
the best.

only hard techno could begin to get you to that level of 
calculated intensity, all others genres pale in comparison. 

 the only one that was there that i know personally besides my 
friends was Dan Sharp. 
Dan, you ever get that tattoo finished? it looked so fucking 
awesome, thats a ballsy move too, getting that giant ass 
plastikman over your whole back.

anyway, i will be there and i hope you people think that the 
hawtin party alone would be worth your trip to demf.

thats all.
i just wanted to say i told you so beforehand.

Mos definitley.
No one throws a party like Ultraworld.
Last year's was awesome, and the lineup this year is much better (at least 
to my tastes, anyway)
It's vintage East Coast stylee with Scott Henry and Feelgood.
Throw in some John Acquaviva and what more do you need?
Ultraworld's really outdid themselves with this venue, too.
It's absolutely awesome to hear Scott Henry playing as the sun
comes up over the B'more harbor.
I'll be there for sure.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} +8+8+8



i'll be sad if this is a superstar dj ego trip. dude, hawtin 
doesnt "control" anything that has to do with me.
i just like his fucking music. i'll close my eyes and face a wall 
to avoid freaking out about hawtin trying to be a superstar dj 
because i truelly fucking hated thinking that when he was in 
pittsburgh last time. its just when i listen to old plus 8 records 
and fuse records that i start forgiving him.

hahaha, but tom, i totally know what you are saying and no i am 
not on his nutsack. dude can just fucking jam.
i just hope and pray it wont be some disgusting ass rave, i just 
want to hear some good hard techno without being grossed out. i 
may be throwing rocks in a glass house here but i dont care 
because its true.

btw, dan's tattoo looks bad ass. it looks cool on its own 
regardless of what one may think about what it symbolizes, thats 
why i had no problem mentioning it. for a long time i wanted one 
too until i had this epiphany about hating hawtin's superstar dj 
ego. 

i gotta go to work.

have a good day!


-hayden

( i think to cure hawtin's ego, maybe he should do a whole show at 
gunpoint. that'll cure his ego for a night)
=0
i'm out

Subject: {pb-cle} ** DirtboxRadio - Broadcasting tonight 8pm-12am EST - Remix Renegades!! **

** http://www.sessions1.com/sunday **

JUNGLE!

08-09pm EST - Hooligan (Seven Dead Hookers, Partners in Crime // MD) - One 
of the bright spots in DC's DNB future, Hooligan has shown strong at parties 
from Adams Morgan to our very own College Park. His mixing is both intuitive 
and fluid, and a pleasure to listen to, and we're more than happy to have 
him on to start the show this week.

09-10pm EST - ODJ (Partners In Crime, DirtboxRadio // CP) - Hey, what can be 
said about your faithful host? At least he can't talk while he's spinning:)

10-12am EST - STAMINA {Joey Migraine & Jon E Kwest} featuring MC Legacy 
(RemixRenegades/Oneman1! Prods./RnR Records // MD) - STAMINA has played all 
over the DC/Baltimore area, at too many parties and places to list. They'll 
be bringing a bag of goodies, and the MC Legacy too:) These guys are cool, 
make sure you tune in for this set!

[NOTE]: to all those who stopped by the page to listen last sunday the 19th, 
miscommunications between myself and the webmaster resulted in the link 
pointing to a dead stream... Those who I sent the direct link to, and those 
who tuned in later on, were able to listen. However, I apologize to those 
who didn't.

[NOTE2]: we've switched over to streaming mp3, via shoutcast. So, no more 
RealPlayer SoundInACan style DNB. *whew* Bitrate will increase soon - the 
current ISP providing the studio has been pretty lax on the upload tip.

peace
ODJ

Subject: {pb-cle} My SDMF review :)

--0-1832682015-1022517274=:86118
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


where to begin... well, if anyone knows me they know im a pretty open minded person with a lot of understanding about peoples flaws. but, this email isnt an understanding one....

 

i personally had the worst time at SDMF according to how i was treated, from start to finish, by a promoter at any party, in this case brian conti (sphere productions). now brian, i know you really dont give two fucks about what i have to say but i thought maybe id vent publicly since it would be pointless venting to you.

 

a pgh dj coming to cleveland to play for free, again, for sphere. just like i did at blossom in twenty degree weather a year ago around halloween. i thought i learned my lesson there, at blossom, when we werent even thanked for playing, but i never got a chance to personally interact with sphere. so when moose told me that we had a chance to play at SDMF i was a little reluctant, but agreed to play cause i thought anything could be better than blossom. well the difference was that it was warmer inside wish night club.

 

i asked for gas money to come to cleveland. denied. i had to sell tickets to make my gas money. wich means for $20 of gas i would have had to sell 20 tickets. no one from pgh was coming to this event especially on friday. at least not 20 of them. so i think hmmm thats pretty fuckin jive, but brian keeps blowin smoke up my ass saying how fun its gonna be, and moose has a positive attitude about it as well. so i arive in cleveland after i spent $30 to get an oil change, and $15 in my gas tank, just because it was gonna be so fun.....

 

i arive at Wish. nice club. but i find out that spinning in the basement means im stuck in the coat check. the whole room was a little longer than my garage and twice as narrow. well, im thinking this sucks real bad now. so i just wanna get a drink at this point. i find brian and ask if i could get some drink comps. "no". but he said hed see what he could do. alright, cool, ill be floatin around up here bro. i saw you three times after that and no drink comps. damn.

 

now i know that nothing was promised to me bri, but im just venting about how much of a shitty promoter you are. and remember, this is just my opinion. so lets recap...

 

i play at blossom for free. no thanx from sphere.

i play at SDMF for free. no thanx from shpere.

i am denied gas money.

i am stuck in the closet of the club i played at, where there was at one point a total of eight people down there.

i am denied any free drinks.

and oh! i almost forgot, my name wasnt even on the flyer because of a misprint.

 

i was hoping to see you before i left to tell you this shit personally but not in so many words brian. and again, by me calling you and telling you personally wouldnt ease any of my frustrations. so i hope you understand.

Hehe, double header of Andy C.  TRUE.

For anyone doubting how good Andy C will be two nights in a row... 
you can rest assured he will be just as entertaining.  During the 
Winter Music Conference I saw him like 5 nights in a row... and 
not only did he ripped it everytime, his sets were still exciting 
everytime.

 Renegades!! **

Damn that's funny. I've never heard of an anus referred to as a "dirtbox", 
but I have heard the vagina called a "box", so dirtbox would definitly be a 
good word for anus.  dirtbox packing, stuff the dirtbox, pack the dirtbox, 
handling instructions for the dirtbox...

hahaha, I almost apologized in my 1st response for thinking it was 
funny/encouraging it, but I didn't because I dont think there's anything 
wrong with humoring immaturity every once in a while. Right after I sent my 
response I remembered a book I had read, when I was about 13 or 14, that I 
thought was the coolest thing...it gave a bunch of different words/slang for 
male/female anatomy. Most of the words I hadn't heard of, some that I had, 
and a few I've never heard anyone ever use. One that I remember was fur 
burger. Ok, I'll stop acting immature. And with that closing statement, I 
think brown box is a good word for it too....:P

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} My SDMF review :)

Posting this on a public list is ignorant... if you couldn't express
your concerns at the event, you should have called or written me to let
me know. 

If your going to post this to a public list, you should inform the
public of all the details. You could have also told Moose, "no, I don't
want to play," and that would have been the end of it. But also
remember, that I didn't book you for the event, it was arranged that you
would play by your counterpart in Cleveland, Moose. And I NEVER even
talked to you until like Wednesday or Thursday before...so there wasn't
even time to "blow smoke up your ass." 

And no, I don't understand why you would post to a public list before
speaking about your concerns to me personally beforehand... besides just
being unprofessional. Not every event will go off without a hitch, and
it's important to express your dissatisfaction to the promoter, but you
should have done that by calling or writing to me first.

My apologies though for not having the PR that I should have had on
Friday, but running 4 clubs is time consuming, and impossible to be 4
places at once. I had someone managing the time schedule, and making
sure all the artists where there and such because of that. Unfortunatly,
you didn't give me but one day to send you over a thanks... Keep in mind
that the event was at 5 clubs, over 2 nights, with like 40 DJ's
playing... There were some DJ's I never even had the chance to see or
say one word to while they were there...

That sucks that there weren't more then 8 people down there listening to
your set, because there were a lot more people at the event than that.
Unfortunatly, I can't tell the people who they should and shouldn't
listen to... but that room has been set up with DJ's before, and worked
out to be a very cool addition.

But honestly Dave, I do greatly appreaciate you playing! And too bad you
didn't give me the chance to tell you... I am in the process now of
calling all the DJ's that played who I didn't get the chance to thank on
Friday and Saturday, and find out what they liked or disliked about the
event. But your purpose for posting this to a public list is obviously
to try and damage my reputation, what other reason would there be?? It's
just too bad you didn't even bother to contact me, or give me the chance
to contact you.

Subject: {pb-cle} My SDMF review :)


where to begin... well, if anyone knows me they know im a pretty open
minded person with a lot of understanding about peoples flaws. but, this
email isnt an understanding one....

 

i personally had the worst time at SDMF according to how i was treated,
from start to finish, by a promoter at any party, in this case brian
conti (sphere productions). now brian, i know you really dont give two
fucks about what i have to say but i thought maybe id vent publicly
since it would be pointless venting to you.

 

a pgh dj coming to cleveland to play for free, again, for sphere. just
like i did at blossom in twenty degree weather a year ago around
halloween. i thought i learned my lesson there, at blossom, when we
werent even thanked for playing, but i never got a chance to personally
interact with sphere. so when moose told me that we had a chance to play
at SDMF i was a little reluctant, but agreed to play cause i thought
anything could be better than blossom. well the difference was that it
was warmer inside wish night club.

 

i asked for gas money to come to cleveland. denied. i had to sell
tickets to make my gas money. wich means for $20 of gas i would have had
to sell 20 tickets. no one from pgh was coming to this event especially
on friday. at least not 20 of them. so i think hmmm thats pretty fuckin
jive, but brian keeps blowin smoke up my ass saying how fun its gonna
be, and moose has a positive attitude about it as well. so i arive in
cleveland after i spent $30 to get an oil change, and $15 in my gas
tank, just because it was gonna be so fun.....

 

i arive at Wish. nice club. but i find out that spinning in the basement
means im stuck in the coat check. the whole room was a little longer
than my garage and twice as narrow. well, im thinking this sucks real
bad now. so i just wanna get a drink at this point. i find brian and ask
if i could get some drink comps. "no". but he said hed see what he could
do. alright, cool, ill be floatin around up here bro. i saw you three
times after that and no drink comps. damn.

 

now i know that nothing was promised to me bri, but im just venting
about how much of a shitty promoter you are. and remember, this is just
my opinion. so lets recap...

 

i play at blossom for free. no thanx from sphere.

i play at SDMF for free. no thanx from shpere.

i am denied gas money.

i am stuck in the closet of the club i played at, where there was at one
point a total of eight people down there.

i am denied any free drinks.

and oh! i almost forgot, my name wasnt even on the flyer because of a
misprint.

 

i was hoping to see you before i left to tell you this shit personally
but not in so many words brian. and again, by me calling you and telling
you personally wouldnt ease any of my frustrations. so i hope you
understand.

Mike Q-Burns Rocks!
I'd never thought I'd say this, but back at Summer Solstice,
he played at the same time as Derrick Carter and completely
blew him out of the water.  I think this man has completely gone mad,
and it shows in his sets, which is definitely a good thing.
His energy is unparalled, except maybe for Carlos or Donald Glaude.
Check him out if you've never seen him, it's worth it.

    dave clarke blew my mind.

    that set alone made my weekend.

    we found a cool restaurant in windsor that
    i've been told resembles a german beer garden.

    getting the car searched not only on the way
    to canada but back was an experience. 

    i wouldn't hesitate to do it again.

    i can't wait to hear more reports on the richie hawtin
    after party. from what i heard, the sound system was
    a meat grinder and a number of people vomitted from
    the sound being so insanely loud. did anyone make it
    until noon?

Remix Renegad





hahaha, I almost apologized in my 1st response for thinking it was 
funny/encouraging it, but I didn't because I dont think there's anything 
wrong with humoring immaturity every once in a while. Right after I sent my 
response I remembered a book I had read, when I was about 13 or 14, that I 
thought was the coolest thing...it gave a bunch of different words/slang for

male/female anatomy. Most of the words I hadn't heard of, some that I had, 
and a few I've never heard anyone ever use. One that I remember was fur 
burger. Ok, I'll stop acting immature. And with that closing statement, I 
think brown box is a good word for it too....:P

Posting this on a public list is ignorant... if you couldn't express
your concerns at the event, you should have called or written me to let
me know.

 

like i said brian, it wouldnt satisfy me to just tell you. and honestly im not trying to tarnish your impecable image but rather draw more attention to the subject wich hopefully will make you think and take action about what you did instead of apologizing to me in private and then saying thanx. your thanx and apologies dont mean anything to me now.

 

If your going to post this to a public list, you should inform the
public of all the details. You could have also told Moose, "no, I don't
want to play," and that would have been the end of it. But also
remember, that I didn't book you for the event, it was arranged that you
would play by your counterpart in Cleveland, Moose. And I NEVER even
talked to you until like Wednesday or Thursday before...so there wasn't
even time to "blow smoke up your ass." 

 

the truth or at least an assumption of what the night might be in the basement would have been appreciated. instead i heard you say "hey, its gonna be a really great time man." nope. but really i dont want to sound too much like a complainer. i made a promise to moose. i kept it. 



And no, I don't understand why you would post to a public list before
speaking about your concerns to me personally beforehand... besides just
being unprofessional. Not every event will go off without a hitch, and
it's important to express your dissatisfaction to the promoter, but you
should have done that by calling or writing to me first.

 

i hope you realize that im not a flamer. and i usually never get into caddy shit on this list. i always try and be professional when doing business with others. in this case its monkey see, monkey do. yes, im a monkey. this subject is a dead horse bra. you understand why, right? it prolly would be worse if i expressed this all personally, to your face. i was furious. i went walking around a little bit looking for you. i went to spy and mercury. even though mercury wasnt your thing. but none the less i was hoping id see you to tell you to your face.

My apologies though for not having the PR that I should have had on
Friday, but running 4 clubs is time consuming, and impossible to be 4
places at once. I had someone managing the time schedule, and making
sure all the artists where there and such because of that. Unfortunatly,
you didn't give me but one day to send you over a thanks... Keep in mind
that the event was at 5 clubs, over 2 nights, with like 40 DJ's
playing... There were some DJ's I never even had the chance to see or
say one word to while they were there...


 

i know youre busy man but ive thrown events/booked people and have been very busy. but i would never ever just blatantly mistreat my talent. especially talent that drove two hours to get there with there own loot.

 


That sucks that there weren't more then 8 people down there listening to
your set, because there were a lot more people at the event than that.
Unfortunatly, I can't tell the people who they should and shouldn't
listen to... but that room has been set up with DJ's before, and worked
out to be a very cool addition.

But honestly Dave, I do greatly appreaciate you playing! And too bad you
didn't give me the chance to tell you... I am in the process now of
calling all the DJ's that played who I didn't get the chance to thank on
Friday and Saturday, and find out what they liked or disliked about the
event. But your purpose for posting this to a public list is obviously
to try and damage my reputation, what other reason would there be?? It's
just too bad you didn't even bother to contact me, or give me the chance
to contact you.

 

brian. im glad you didnt call and thank me because it would enrage me more. too bad? for what? i see who you are now and its jaded me to do favors for anyone now. thats whats too bad.

 

i am now done with the public posts on this matter everyone. brian, if youd like to talk in private... feel free.

dissapointed with most of the people there..

i can understand a late thanks being less-appreciated than a timely
one, but not this.  and apologies are ALWAYS after the fact.

if bc did indeed screw you over, be at least willing to acknowledge
what he has/may have done to rectify the situation.  otherwise, you end
up sounding like a hothead.

i made this a public topic blake, feel free to get involved. and you are correct that statement is unfortunate. but it really is how i feel, even after my head cooled down.



i can understand a late thanks being less-appreciated than a timely
one, but not this. and apologies are ALWAYS after the fact.

 

im sure you could understand better if you were me, or there with me. after the fact is too late for me. for five bad things of this magnitude to happen to anyone on a booking is uncalled for. and really, im a very understanding person. but im not going to try and manipulate you to feel how i feel.



if bc did indeed screw you over, be at least willing to acknowledge
what he has/may have done to rectify the situation. otherwise, you end
up sounding like a hothead.

 

thanx for your concern about what i sound like blake. i guess you cant tell via email but i am always willing to anaylize and acknowledge everything before i let my emotions take over. this post was carefully thought through and the main thing meant by it was to call out the wrong that i felt was done to me so maybe other promoters will see it and try to stay away from doing it. so, rectify, smectify. its done. and im really not mad about it. i was. but i still feel the same. but, brian if youre reading this... i love greygoose. i can give you my address in private. thanx.

clevr

so i find myself at home today instead of at work....i musta left the =
state last weekend

getting to demf was only 1/4 of the fun...what happened to leaving at =
noon? so a trip to the mall, tops, ames, jessies house, and a dead car =
battery later we are on the turnpike headed to detroit...so we get there =
and smuggle in our beer (3cases worth one of the bags broke from the =
weight of 48 cans) and start iceing that shit down in the tub....the =
smart ones in the crew(jes, rich, mike, and myself)didnt run down to the =
festival immediately...we slammed a bunch of brew....then left(after the =
rain let up for good)...good thing we did the slamming at the hotel, we =
get down there to find that beer is 5 bux a cup!  so 40 dollars later we =
are wandering the festival...caught a bit of paul johnson, headed to the =
main stage, dont know who was playing, but we were standing directly =
infront of a wall of speakers and we could talk to each other without =
screaming....so we went back to the beer stand...wandered over to the =
mgd stage for a min...dont know who was playing, but the crowd loved =
it...back to the beer stand again...it should be noted at this =
point...that every trip to the beer stand meant that jessie and mike =
came back with two beers a piece(and one of those went down my =
gullet)...so we head to the underground stage...man like drama on the =
decks...oh god....the way to end the nite for me...banging dark drum and =
bass...the room was packed and the crowd was eating that shit up....all =
the tunes of the moment i guess, metrosound, thugged out bitch, pacman =
rmx....but what amazed me was drama's skills, every mix was on =
point....no emcee =3D no rewind...but i was screaming for a few =
anyway(which i didnt get)....after that some how we stumbled back to the =
hotel generally making asses of ourselves and not caring cuz the blood =
alcohol level was about 2.3....

so we get back to the telly, and starting drinking the nice and cold =
beer...bathtub fulla ice is the best cooler...its self draining...3 of =
us were doing an ice line...one person at the machine, one person =
between the door and the machine, one person at the door of the room...i =
hope next year our room is directly infront of ice machine...this was =
nice setup...we start riding the elevators looking for parties...the =
only thing i can compare the reinsance hotel to last weekend would be a =
hippie festival indoors with no hippies...drunks everywhere looking for =
the party...at one point we rode the elevator past every floor looking =
for the party...we get back to the hotel room at some point and get into =
chill mode...

sunday morning we get breakfast from a bomb buffet...and it was =
bomb...everything you could possibly want for breakfast from apricot =
waffles to yougurt...the extra 10 bux for the breakfast package was =
worth it...good service at the renisance...back upstairs for a shower =
and down to the festival...i smuggled beer on on saturday...and nothing =
tastes better than free warm beer...i think i met blake from the list =
saturday, but im not really sure...i met somebody and he came back to =
the room to chill for a bit....anyways i took a cat nap at this =
point...and it was nice...when i woke up it was time for a beer run...we =
headed across the walkway to some tiny ass liqour store in the lobby of =
the courtyard...whats up with 20 bux for a 12 pack and 11 bux for a 6 =
pack?? fuckers....so we headed back to the room and iced that shit =
down....we headed back down to the festival around 6 or 7 i think...when =
we got back there it was JUMPING....had to be at least 25,000 ppl in the =
plaza with 10 or 15 crowded into the main stage area for man like george =
clinton...so we gyros and beer and head in...mr clinton was like 50 mins =
late to the stage...so we passed the time by making general drunken =
asses of ourselves and all that...saw a few ppl go down from heat booze =
or drugs on the floor of the main stage area...the one dude looked =
pretty bad...eyes rolled back and foam from the mouth....i must give =
props to medical staff at demf....they went above and beyond all =
weekend...george clinton finally comes on...and like i said, the sound =
in the main arena was quiet if you were on the floor...if you were back =
aways it actually seemed louder....so we could barely hear him...at this =
point it was 910 and time to head over to krust...but not without more =
beer and a bathroom break...on the way over some shady fuck flipped my 5 =
dollar "jungle juice" outa my hand...grrrr....fucker....so we get there =
and some tech dj is on....and finally 937pm man like krust steps to the =
decks....jesus christ....the whole reason i came out to demf was for =
this set...and it did not dissapoint...krust straight laid it =
down...plates plates plates....he teased the fuck outa tracks too...it =
was great...i think the crowd for krust was the most hype crowd all =
weekend too...everyone was getting down...and ppl were packed in tighter =
than down at george clinton...i dont think ive brocked out like that for =
3 years at least...everyone at the dnb stage was super friendly =
too...unlike some of the dicks around the tech stages....krust finishes =
the job and we head back to the hotel room...we had to smuggle in more =
beer and two extra ppl...we get that done and finish drinking it =
down....at this point i hafta send a big fuck you to JOCKO...you are a =
piece of shit dude, you drank all of jessies zima saturday nite then all =
of her smirnoff sunday nite....first off, you didnt pay for any of =
it...second of all you didnt ask, third of all you are a dude drink beer =
pussy....anyways sunday nite ended at the telly for me...some ppl went =
to the hawtin party...but i was about broke at this point...the hawtin =
ppl got back about 6am with a sac of white castle...which was =
awful...but at that point it was the best food in the world...it should =
be noted that ms jea leigh used the toilet as a pillow that nite..i =
would have pictures but i couldnt find a camera...JESSIE YOU PUKED...

monday morning and i find myself signing a forged named to the breakfast =
check and charging it to someone elses room....like i said i was =
broke...get back to the room and try to clean it up a bit....washed up =
and checked out...in the parking garage i slammed a few warm ones and =
headed down to the festival....wandered around for a bit....found out =
that there was dnb going on in the underground stage again....man like =
matt clark on the decks....this dude was laying it down too...he had an =
emcee and we heard at least 5 rewinds...the crowd was eating up...saw mr =
tik tak(and family) down there too...i think alex was the only person i =
actually saw breakdancing in detroit...everyone else was doing pops and =
shit...monday was a mellow day...i spent my last 5 bux on a cuppa beer =
and we headed up to catch some of t-1000....he was playing some downbeat =
tech...me and jessie went to check out the computer center during his =
set...guitar center had some nice g4s setup and had ppl showing kids =
howto use reason....back up to t-1000...he finished up and it was =
decided to leave...half of me wanted to stay and see dialated peoples, =
but the other half just wanted to go home, i was tired and broke....

all and all i had a great time...best time ive had at a festival in i =
cant remember how long...i wish there would have been more dnb...but it =
was a detroit and detroit is definately a techno town...next year im =
sure beer will cost more(fuckers)..but ill be there for sure...and next =
year i will get that case of 40s before i get there...


man like nick s

dave clarke was absulotelyfuckinginsane.  when i found out he was playing on
the "underground stage" (it's literally "under ground") i was so pleased.
it's the best area at the festival, i think.  so i was front and center like
the dave geek that i am, and he completely tore it up.  amazing.  again,
he's confirmed that he's the best dj on this planet.  it was pretty much a
2000 person two hour orgasm ending with classic electro.  god - it was so
sweet.  i'd pay $1000 for that set.  (then i'd make adam ratana wait three
years for a copy of it ;p)

other stuff happened too.

Posting this on a public list is ignorant... if you couldn't express
your concerns at the event, you should have called or written me to let
me know.

 

like i said brian, it wouldnt satisfy me to just tell you. and honestly
im not trying to tarnish your impecable image but rather draw more
attention to the subject wich hopefully will make you think and take
action about what you did instead of apologizing to me in private and
then saying thanx. your thanx and apologies dont mean anything to me
now.

 

If your going to post this to a public list, you should inform the
public of all the details. You could have also told Moose, "no, I don't
want to play," and that would have been the end of it. But also
remember, that I didn't book you for the event, it was arranged that you
would play by your counterpart in Cleveland, Moose. And I NEVER even
talked to you until like Wednesday or Thursday before...so there wasn't
even time to "blow smoke up your ass." 

 

the truth or at least an assumption of what the night might be in the
basement would have been appreciated. instead i heard you say "hey, its
gonna be a really great time man." nope. but really i dont want to sound
too much like a complainer. i made a promise to moose. i kept it. 



And no, I don't understand why you would post to a public list before
speaking about your concerns to me personally beforehand... besides just
being unprofessional. Not every event will go off without a hitch, and
it's important to express your dissatisfaction to the promoter, but you
should have done that by calling or writing to me first.

 

i hope you realize that im not a flamer. and i usually never get into
caddy shit on this list. i always try and be professional when doing
business with others. in this case its monkey see, monkey do. yes, im a
monkey. this subject is a dead horse bra. you understand why, right? it
prolly would be worse if i expressed this all personally, to your face.
i was furious. i went walking around a little bit looking for you. i
went to spy and mercury. even though mercury wasnt your thing. but none
the less i was hoping id see you to tell you to your face.

My apologies though for not having the PR that I should have had on
Friday, but running 4 clubs is time consuming, and impossible to be 4
places at once. I had someone managing the time schedule, and making
sure all the artists where there and such because of that. Unfortunatly,
you didn't give me but one day to send you over a thanks... Keep in mind
that the event was at 5 clubs, over 2 nights, with like 40 DJ's
playing... There were some DJ's I never even had the chance to see or
say one word to while they were there...


 

i know youre busy man but ive thrown events/booked people and have been
very busy. but i would never ever just blatantly mistreat my talent.
especially talent that drove two hours to get there with there own loot.

 


That sucks that there weren't more then 8 people down there listening to
your set, because there were a lot more people at the event than that.
Unfortunatly, I can't tell the people who they should and shouldn't
listen to... but that room has been set up with DJ's before, and worked
out to be a very cool addition.

But honestly Dave, I do greatly appreaciate you playing! And too bad you
didn't give me the chance to tell you... I am in the process now of
calling all the DJ's that played who I didn't get the chance to thank on
Friday and Saturday, and find out what they liked or disliked about the
event. But your purpose for posting this to a public list is obviously
to try and damage my reputation, what other reason would there be?? It's
just too bad you didn't even bother to contact me, or give me the chance
to contact you.

 

brian. im glad you didnt call and thank me because it would enrage me
more. too bad? for what? i see who you are now and its jaded me to do
favors for anyone now. thats whats too bad.

 

i am now done with the public posts on this matter everyone. brian, if
youd like to talk in private... feel free.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} demf




i have 2 of clark's tracks that i heard there in my top ten 
records list. i am glad to finally have the chance to check a live 
set out of his. i liked it and it renewed my faith in the music 
i'm into. i thought i was the only one there for awhile. ( no dj 
in pittsburgh aside from myself and i'm not even anything yet is 
into the type of techno dave clark is) 
did dude have a 505 up there? he was doing all that stuff in the 
air with his hands to control his pieces..i only know of the one 
thing on the 505 with the infra-red sensor on it that does that.

anyway, i am not going to review "Control" unless someone wants to 
know what i thought about it.in a nutshell, if you were'nt at Jak, 
you missed it. Jak reigns supreme. if you werent there then you 
will never know.control was fucking cool though. that is my idea 
of a fucking rave. totally underground music.

demf was cool minus all the trash people threw everywhere. what 
they need are big fines for litterbugs and more giant in your face 
garbage bins.


alright yall

spitting into a corvette convertable(no one was inside, it was inside the gm
bldg)
seeing boobs while i was waiting for george clinton
seeing the flasher kiss another girl(they were both on dude's shoulders)

Hopefully, now that the state got its $6 mill for added terrorist security

funds (most of which will go to the military and the cops to increase the

nazi like martial law like military state of security, not education

or local funding mind you!), it can stop trying to set me up as a gang lord 

or a friggin spy, when the whole city knew what was going on!...and 

completely illogical since i was born here (3rd generation mind you!) and 

have had no military training and studied architecture and art history at 

case western (which boots students for doing drugs!) god damned war 

mongers still think it's WWII!!...i'm not even japenese!!...friggin retards 

runnin this nation!!...i have to do their homework for free!!...too bad all the 

terrorist  propaganda cost the state $1.77 BILLION in losses from the 

recession after 9/11!!...i am proud to say that i *did not* vote for Bush, who 

looks like he's trying to start Armageddon!!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} My SDMF review :)

So is this dave clevr like some whiny eight year old?

I've been gone for a week, and it sounds like it to me.

I'd have to say read whatever was in the contract you signed if you
expeceted anything.  Oh, wait, let me guess, you never bothered to get a
contract either, even after you were "screwed" at blossom last year.

Ooh it cost me 15 bux in gas.  Ooh I needed an oil change (didn;'t realize
it was 3000 miles from CLE to PIT).

Ok maybe seven years old.

sheesh.

Sphere's events are about the only thing keeping cleveland alive, if you
don't realize that, stay in Pittsburgh.  (and of course Goahead as well
keeps it going...)

I only wish I didn't have to leave cleveland this weekend to see the family,
or I'd a certainly been around.

And I never even got a thank you.  What now, some co-dependent chick too?

All from a letter that starts out "now I know I was never promised
anything...."  So to summarize you are pissed you never got what you were
never told you would get.  That makes sense.

Ignorant people piss me off.

when moose told me that we had a chance to play at SDMF i was a little

blossom. well the difference was that it was warmer inside wish night club.

keeps blowin smoke up my ass saying how fun its gonna be, and moose has a

me too.

i love how you ignorantly throw out your opinion your entire post, and end
with that. it is just so fitting.

if someone is upset because of how they were treated, should they say
nothing? or voice their opinion to a group of their peers? or should you be
the only one allowed to have an opinion, and so of course it is right?

personally, i think all djs should have a contract, whether they are playing
for someone they have never met, or for their best friend. and you know what
is so sad is the fact that it has come to that.

when we used to throw parties, we never, NEVER, needed a contract. not with
our friends, not with headlining djs. but people have been screwed over so
many times that it has come to that.

i think it is extremely sad to hear that a dj was asked to play out of town
for free and then not even offered gas money. once again, when we threw
parties, we never asked someone to come from out of town and not offer at
least gas money, some dinner (be it pizza or whatever), and some drinks. but
then again, maybe that is just how it is nowadays.

but hey, if someone is "keeping the scene alive" they should do it, no
matter what that entails, right?

i guess i am just living in fantasyland where people threw parties to have
fun and give other people a cool new experience, and didn't have an excuse
for treating people badly, because they didn't treat people badly in the
first place...

the sun is so pretty over here...

good point dori, but i know plenty of people in the area still tryin to keep
it real and just have fun.  I'm throwing my event (cook da goose ii, july
20) for free again this year and giving food and beverage to everyone that
comes to spin (and attend) and i actually feel bad for not being able to
offer up gas money, although i was thinking about having a tip jar (idea
stolen from lenny mack) at the dj booth that could be split up afterwards,
but not sure yet.  But on the other hand, i'm giving right back 2 weekends
after by driving to cleveland to spin for free (field day, august 3, i
think) to repay the favor and just have fun and have food to eat.  I just
look at it this way, i spun alot of shit for free last year, i havent got a
raise at my job in 18 months, so i just view it as my dj career being on a
raise freeze as well, so i'll spin for free this year too until someone
wants to give me a raise :o)

yes yes....

Saturday..   before we leave.. car trouble. Entered Detroit at 5pm, nice =
hard rain. Got to the hotel to register in, saw Roxy and the crew right =
off the bat. After settling in for a while, we left to hit up the scene. =
Real chill,..  I had a nice time scoping beats on Saturday. Dj Drama =
gave a nice set though in the basement room. After that we went back to =
the hotel and hung out for a while. Got to visit Roxy and her crew =
again, who were a couple floors above us... after a while.. slept.


Sundaaay..   was the shake down night. I think after waking up at about =
8am, and not leaving the room till 2. Things got pretty intense down at =
the park. I finally met up with Blake after almost not recognizing him. =
I accidently bumped into him.  Went back to the hotel room, and chilled =
out for a little more. Oh yea, i caught some sun.
anyways..  after about 5 or 6, we headed back down, and damn was it =
getting crowded.
yea yea.. i did start drinking early, but it all adds up to seeing krust =
later. George Clinton took to damn long to get on stage..       Krust... =
  was....   niiiiiiiice.=20
Thanks to me jamming out, i did fall,..  yea..  not once, but 2 times. I =
didnt care though.
Some how, made it back to the hotel..  clowning around with more drunk =
people in the elevator, we hit every number to the floors on the way =
up,.. so i could strike a pose for everyone else trying to get in. It =
was pretty interesting seeming how everyone else was screaming for me. =
:P      after that got back to the hotel room finally, and saw Dez in =
the room. It was nice seeing him for once...    then later..  passed =
out.  Yea.. I literally passed out. No nick, i didnt get sick in the =
bathroom..  i was just.. um..   trying to brush my hair?!?!  :P    but =
really... there was no way i got sick...   afterwards, passed out till =
the next day.

Monday...  woke up, packed our stuff.. and basically headed for the =
event again.. drinking a little again we did, but it was mostly left =
overs from the night before...    caught Matt Clarke, and damn this dude =
was slamming..  I wish i could find a way to get ahold of him...
Caught Dennis Cox, who is the nicest guy in the world. He was passing =
out stickers that said..  "I Love Cox"..  i didnt get any though.. i was =
trying to get them for Tom Cox, since everyone loves tom cox.. :P
Caught some of Frankie Bones, who really didnt impress me that much. =
Although I have to say Green Velvet was kinda funny to watch. I know =
there's a ton of things im missing, but im sure to squeeze it in later =
maybe...

oh yea.. missed Dilated Peoples, thanks to some whiney ass turds....

went home..  fell asleep.=20

um, you would need access to LSD (which i do not) and 
training from the CIA on brainwashing foreign leaders with that

>anyone else ever notice that tech mixes are all about cutting the 
bass for a
>32 then cutting it back in? am i nuts?

not nuts, maybe stupid. i dont know. aside from deiselboy, the 
best technical dance deejays ive ever seen were all techno 
deejays. 

>it seemed to me everytime a deejay cut the bass back in after it 
had been
>off for 32 beats the crowd went nuts

it seems to me that every time a jungle deejay mixes a record, he 
mixes it right up to the breakdowns/bassdrops that every jungle 
record has. alot of techno records have no cues like that, making 
the buildups, breakdowns, etc is left up to the deejay. you cant 
be as creative with jungle records as you can with techno, mainly 
because 2 jungle basslines going over each other sounds like 
asshole. 

anyway, jungle today is becoming laughably irrelevant to me. even 
the current dope producers (especially high contrast, his LP is 
too fucking dope) couldnt get me back into it enough to want to 
buy records. im gonna be ebaying another batch of 300+ jungle 
records. i cant believe driving all that distance to detroit to 
even care about krust above the other people playing. the reviews 
ive read elsewhere of the UR and planet e afterparties made me sad 
i didnt go. and most reviews i read for the hawtin party called 
it "boring". im guess im not the only person on the face of the 
earth who thinks techno like that is shite. 

jungle and hard techno still suck in '02, 

tom

yeah, well i know how many times ive signed contracts. ive played 
for alot of the bigger Pgh people over the years, Downlow, House 
of Styles, etc etc, and i never once signed a contract with them. 
i played in cleveland in a situation similar to dave's where i was 
added late and didnt appear on the flyer, and i didnt sign shit. 
and i got paid (this was 2 tigers' rave, cant remember the name, 
it was september 25th 1999) and i didnt have to worry about a 
thing. 

>Ooh it cost me 15 bux in gas.  Ooh I needed an oil change 
(didn;'t realize

car maitenence is very important before a long trip, stupid.

there's a very general loose code of conduct involved when 
deejaying is involved:

#1 FREE DRINKS - if this isnt there, someone is a fuckup. i cant 
believe that someone would ever expect to not give deejays as much 
alcohol as they want/need. that is offensively ignorant

#2 GAS $$$$ - the deejay doesnt need to come out on top monetarily 
when he spins for you, but he should NEVER come out in the hole on 
general principle, unless its agreed upon beforehand. 

#3 APPRECIATION - there's no excuse for a promoter to not meet who 
is playing at his/her rave. i cant even imagine that. dave did see 
brian, but was ignored by him after requesting #1. that is 
bullshit, and the epitome of assholicness. 

#4 PLACE TO CRASH - this wasnt an issue here, but a place to stay 
for the night should always be offered to out of town people, even 
if its just at the promoter's house. 

these things are all immidiately understood when someone is 
spinning at an event, unless details are worked out beforehand 
specifically. the promoter should be held directly responsible for 
any violations of these rules.

it really is sad that so many people are out to fuck people over 
that it is almost necessary. again, i still dont sign shit like 
that, but i deal only with people i know personally and i havent 
been let down by one of them yet. until then, ill keep it real. i 
have signed contracts with people booking me that i didnt know at 
all.

thinking about it, i dont think PBS ever signed a deejay contract 
either.

that is just totally asinine. when people played for PBS, they got 
the whole package: the city tour, room and board at the nicest 
house that one of us was living in (i had venetian snares in my 
basement for a week : ), free beer while they were in town, and 
especially at their performance. 

>but hey, if someone is "keeping the scene alive" they should do

i could be wrong, but doesnt brian throw and promote club 
nights/raves/concerts for a living? if he does, and he's shorting 
people to do that, he's one of the biggest turds ive ever heard 
of.

there's no excuse for that.

it's one thing to play for free for something free or cheap, but another to
play for free for something geared totally at turning a profit and is

Nope...It's 'pretty much' all Goahead and Digital
Xtreme in Cleveland. 

SDMF wasn't ONE BIT geared to the 'scene'. 

Maybe the Club Scene...that's about it.

Agreed...however, let's get back to what event started
all of this madness. SDMF. An event in no way shape or
form of having intention to 'keep it real' and 'have
fun'.

It was a business move. To make money.

Subject: {pb-cle} the now written, "unwritten rules" :)

Looks like Tom has gone and written the "unwritten rules of conduct"
I only expect these as a DJ, because I was a promoter for years
before I got behind the decks...

Yeah, it is a business...which really sucks sometimes. Nobody
ever said that we had to stop treating people like friends, just
because it's business....did they?

Heh, there's a little saying, a philosophy even...Something from
back in my longhaired, sleepin-in-the-woods, nomadic days...
(yeah,  I was a fookin hippie, and there's some damn funny pix to
prove it, and laugh about now,  haha) Anyway, it's just two words,
call it cliche' if you wish, but it sure does seem to make life better,
and misunderstandings almost non-exisstant...

Be Kind

Wishing you all a beautiful day,

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} quick demf re:view

vibration was loud enough to cause pain at the time, and i had some serious
hearing loss for 2-3 days after.  luckily it came back, that was my wakeup
call that loud speakers are bad for the ears.

at engage it was loud enough that breathing near the speakers in the jungle
room was difficult and i found that i breathed in between beats to make it
easier.

damn you ultraworld, damn you all to hell!

Subject: {pb-cle} looking for demos - house, techno, electro

Hey, I'm looking for demos from people to play at a club night starting up
in a little bit:

   * House - deep, tribal, funky.  Not really interested in hard house,
bad boy bill house, etc.  A little progressive may be okay as long as
its not really cheesy.

   * Techno - deep, tribal, funky, detroit, etc.  If you play bangin hard
techno, that's cool, but show me your diversity, I dont want to hear a
demo of pure hard techno.

   * Electro - can't really be too picky since not too many people around
here play it, so I'm interested in hearing whatever you got.

   * Soulful DNB - do you wanna be Fabio?  If so hook it up.  Not too
interested in booking DNB but if you can run w/ the soul and the class,
then I'm all for hearing it.

Think mature. Think "class."

Qualities I am interested in hearing:
----------------------------------
   * Tight mixing - slips are okay, we are all human, just no trainwrecks
every mix

   * Good phrasing

   * Selection/ability to build a set - shouldnt sound like a whole bunch
of tracks mixed together, each should have a logical place in your mix.
"take me on a journey from point A to point B"


---
If you have a downloadable high quality mp3 online, hook up a URL,
otherwise send me a CD or Tape to:

Adam Ratana
5719 Elwood St. Apt. 7
Pittsburgh, PA 15232

Get me these ASAP if you can.  Forward this message on to anyone you know
who fits this category and can send a demo.  Thanks.

If you play any of these and you don't have a demo, _please don't email
me_.  Instead, throw a cassette in your tape recorder, play for 90 minutes
and then mail it to me.

Curt?  What are you adding to this discusion?  You are not attached to this
subject in any way--an outsideer.  Why would you even post?  I am a dj who
happens "work" for sphere and who certainly has an opinion on this issue,
however, i withheld my comments.  I abstained, that is, until i saw your
silly post.  I especially like the last line where you say, "ignorant people
piss me off",  as a suffix to the rest of your email, it certainly makes a
powerful statement!

Began the holiday weekend Saturday at Touch in Cleveland for SHIFT around 11pm. No one was there. No one. Sat in basement with David (HeadRush, NYC) for an hour before heading to Metropolis. Finally a couple martini-drinkers ventured down. Good beats, yet no one dancing. Am betting there were some good sets the rest of the night. mgs -- where were you?

Metropolis/SDMF Saturday was a great time. Was a little surprised at the "order" of the evening; Ryan Matthew's track selection was very happy/spiritual/anthem-y -- sounds I would have expected to hear at end the party, not at midnight, but it was a great set for that kind of trance. 

Sandra Collins' set was fantastic, though short. I knew we'd be in for a treat when she dropped a Portishead remix early on. Good energy, dark and driving. For anyone who wanted to put her in the "pussy trance-anthem" category, I believe she proved otherwise.

And Ian Mariano's set was also fantastic and put together well. Thanks, Ian! Great way to end the party. (Music is the Answer). If that first track is any indication of where N Space is headed, I know we can expect great things from you.

The crowd there seemed also to be quality. It was sparse, but the majority of those in attendance seemed to be there for the chance to hear quality sets.

That party was the highlight of the weekend.

DEMF was, frankly, a disappointment overall. We arrived Sunday late afternoon/early evening. (Sorry we missed the netmeet, Roxy. I called and left you a voice message). I immediately felt a bad vibe. People were: Sloppy. Rude. Trashy. I heard everything BUT techno for the first two hours I was there. Finally got down underground for Dave Clarke, and 20 minutes into the set was hit right on my spine by some guy who wasn't paying attention to the fact we were packed in like sardines. He hit me squarely with his elbow while dancing, and didn't even miss a beat, let alone stop to apologize. I felt like I was in a mosh pit. He hit me so hard, the pain shot straight through my body and I started to get sick. We had to leave. (I now have a bruise on my spine). But what I did hear of Dave was bangin' good techno (minus some slips that seemed like the equipment either wasn't responding to him fast enough or there was an echo delay in the room).

So, the bottom line is that I was hurt pretty bad and missed the Hawtin party. I was so ticked off! We got back to the festival around 4:00pm Monday and talked to a guy who had just left Hawtin. It ended at 3:30pm. He said the end of the party was quality. About 20 people left, room to dance, great end to the journey. I don't care if I have to be wheeled in on a stretcher next year. I'm not missing it.

Monday afternoon, caught Frankie Bones and T-1000. Good stuff. Much better vibe. Much better. 

Tronic Treatment party on Monday night was off the hook. Old school abandoned-looking building. Didn't get there in time for all of Christian Smith, but Adam Beyer/Marco Carola tag team was unbelievable, as was John Selway's set. Only disappointment was that John Selway ended at 6am, and didn't keep going until 7am! :-) Selway gave me energy to keep going on the dance floor even at that hour.

I will definitely be more selective about parties and stages when and IF I go to DEMF next year. I was not feeling a whole lotta love at that festival, and felt it was a lot of work to try to get to the music.

That's entirely possible.  The government has been working on a 
weapon that does just that.  It sends ultra low (or maybe ultra high, 
not sure) frequencies and it upsets the attacker(s) stomac so they 
either start puking or dump a load in their pants.

Subject: {pb-cle} my demf

first off, I wanna say wuzzup to one mistah darkcube who hooked me up for 
the weekend. (THANKS!!!!!!) As for the weekend itself, it's still sort of a 
blur. I went to motor on friday night, heard a very disappointing set by 
freaky flow. Saturday, we checked in to the hotel, saw t. linder's kickass 
electro set (zone, you would've loved it), and somehow managed to escape 
getting rained on. That night we went to the majestic, and made in time for 
aphrodite's last track :-(, but by then I was so tired I didn't care 
anymore....sunday was sort of a blah day, I wondered around for a bit trying 
to find anyone from pb-cle (the only person I saw isn't even on the list), 
and the complete mass insanity of waaaaay too many people made doing 
anything difficult. I didn't end up going to richie, I was so tired, I just 
passed the fuck out.....Monday was fun, saw Matt Clarke first, and he 
fucking rocked my socks off (hey, jungle mike, I gotta get you a demo), then 
wondered around for a bit, the nefarious.net tent was slammin all day long. 
at night, the auxmen!!! I had so much fuckin fun dancing, that I didn't want 
to go.....
Anyways, I had a really good time, it was my first demf, and def. not my 
last. I met a ton of really cool people that I hope to see again many times 
over the summer.....

peace,
trish

Subject: {pb-cle} DEMF review (a.k.a. my weekend as a rockstar)

Well, I thought I'd throw in my DEMF review here...

Friday:
Drove up to Columbus to hitch a ride with friends from there.  Our hotel was in Windsor, got to the bridge, found a sleeping toll-booth guard with a six inch string of drool comin' from his mouth, priceless.  Too bad he woke up before I could snap a picture.  Crossed the bridge, got sent to Customs/Immigration since none of us had brought our birth certificates.  Had our entire van searched, that sucked.  Got to the hotel, slept, woke up. 
Saturday:
Waited for our ride to call to pick us up(they stayed with a friend), they didn't call til 2.  We didn't get across the border until 6(more hassles at the border).  We decided to not go back to Windsor the rest of the weekend.  Headed over to the C-pop stage eventually to hear Paul Johnson spin(knew a friend of mine would be there, was trying to find a place to crash the rest of the weekend...).  Found him, lodging for the rest of the weekend was secured(in a suite at the Omni, no less).  Danced my ass off to Paul's set(been trying to hear him spin for over a year now with no success).  Did some stage hopping the rest of the day at the festival, then headed out to the Urban Takeover afterparty with Aphrodite, Adam Beyer and Colette.  It was fun, was good to hear some Drum and Bass, despite it being Aphrodite.  Adam Beyer was good, dug some of his set(Techno isn't my thing, I'm very picky about what kind of techno I like), but most of it wasn't my style.  Was mainly there vending(tshirts, tapes, glowsticks, etc) to help pay for the rest of the trip.   Got back to the hotel, slept for a little bit.  

Sunday: 
Woke up and got a little bit of breakfast, found out that Heather Heart was in the room next to us and had been rather rude and noisy the night before to Kyung(thats who's hotel room I was crashing in...). We decided that we'd try and throw a hotel party to basically piss her off that night.  Headed over to the festival with my old roommate Amanda and she hooked me up with an restricted access artist pass for the day(she works for Dustraxx).  I enjoyed the benifits of that(access to all stages all day long, free food and drinks, clean porta-pots).  Checked out Boo Williams' set on the C-pop stage(I came for the House mostly at the festival), got up on stage took some pictures.  Headed over to the Tower for a bit, checked out Adam X for a little while, got to hang out up in the tower and look down on the masses.  Did some more stage hopping until George Clinton went on.  Got to sit in a nice little grassy area fairly close to the stage(this is the only time that our passes wouldn't allow us onstage).  Enjoyed the set, headed back to the hospitality area backstage for a bit, talked to one of the members of P-Funk and invited them to our hotel party.  Kyung spoke with George Clinton's mama and wife at some point and invited them as well(although they didn't show up).  Found some turntables, sound and DJs over the course of the day, had a pretty dope lineup.  We had Paul Johnson, DJ Drama, Foursqare and some friends from Louisville spin.  It was fuckin' surreal.  Paul spun for three hours in our hotel room.  I danced my ass off in my socks, got into that groove where you feel like the music is controlling your every move.  It was an absolutely amazing experience and I haven't danced like that in ages.  I could have went home then and been absolutely content.  I don't think I'll be able to fully describe that night until I have time to take it all in and some parts of that night I don't think I'll ever be able to describe in words.  It was completely surreal.  

Monday: 
Got to the festival in time to catch Green Velvets live set, got to hear the Perculator, Lala land, The Answering Machine thing and the Camera's ready prepare to flash track.  I was happy, still buzzing on the adrenaline from the night before.  Went backstage during T-1000 for a while, saw Carol Marvin.  You'd think that someone who has trouble walking would think to wear comfortable shoes instead of 4 inch heels.  But then again, it is Carol Marvin...she's all about image and you can tell...they had to have two security people help her up the stairs.  Went over to one of the booths to say thank you to Paul for the hotel thing and to say some goodbyes a little ways into the Advent's set.  Had to miss the Dilated Peoples, unfortunately.  

Thats pretty brief, I could go on for hours about the weekend.  The festival itself wasn't as good as last year, but my personal experience was better.  My knees are still recovering from the beating they took during our hotel party, but it was worth it, times like those are the reason I got into this whole thing.  

Still in awe, 
   Heather

nah, nothing new.   the nazis did work on this i believe.

like 9 hz at 120 decibels or something.  another frequency makes you shiver.

problem was the speakers that could move this amount of air were semi trailer
sized or something insane.

and to me thats what all events seem like more or less. Thats why i dont
push myself to play. Id rather play for someone who's doing the event for
the people, and not so much for themselves. I get so tired of seeing the
BS.. why not do something healthy for everyone rather than have everyone go
against each other.

Another reason why i dont push myself to play..  Im tired of seeing all the
shit talking "cleveland dnb headz here, and its mostly the ones who arent
out playing all the time"...  basically talking shit on others to get
themselves some where. Im not here for the competition, nor will i EVER be.

anyways.. back to the subject, yes i agree on travel expenses.. its
rediculous to have someone play at your event thats hours away, and not
expect atleast a little something.
Not to mention, would someone like to take the blame if that dj had to drive
home because he or she drank a little ..  and boom..

i duno..  im ramblin on.

From: "*** trinity" <trinity@ravermail.com>


Began the holiday weekend Saturday at Touch in Cleveland for SHIFT around
11pm. No one was there. No one. Sat in basement with David (HeadRush, NYC)
for an hour before heading to Metropolis. Finally a couple martini-drinkers
ventured down. Good beats, yet no one dancing. Am betting there were some
good sets the rest of the night. mgs -- where were you?

<<<

sorry, we got there a bit late.  we decided to bbq before we left and it
threw the timetable off.  i looked for you but i figured we had missed you.
you're right, nobody was at shift at first.  i was there for a few minutes,
then i left for a few minutes.  when i walked back in at 12:30 it had filled
up considerably.  zip and sammy d were nutty.  they played some twisted
weird german techno for a bit before going into deep house.  unfortunately
they liked to drink and the mixing got a bit sloppy towards the end.  i was
pretty drunk too so it was the correct speed for me  ;)

john selway will be at shift next month.  he said he'll be playing some of
that new electroclash shite.  not sure how i feel about that, but it might
be worth checking out.

    -mike

Subject: {pb-cle} Help with track ID

Just heard  a track on bassdrive that I NEED...

It's by Ray Keith...It was listed as "unknown", but it's pretty easy to pick
out.

It has that old "when I think about you....my feelings can't explain" sample
that, I think it was, Acen used for Trip II The Moon.

I _NEED_ this track.

Any info is greatly appreciated....

Its funny, these are the very same things I try to make sure happen for my 
guys, but you know what it doesnt always happen.
Promoters now and days think that since they have to pay a dj they don't 
have to respect them. I blame age and a lack of knowledge for that.
Its a shame really considering that dj's tend to be completely indifferent 
to what is ever badly said about promoters.
Then they go and play for them and find out the truth for themselves.

I found a quick cure all for that problem.
Its called beat the shit out of the promoter.
Burn down his party.
Steal the promoters decks.
Shake the promoter down for every dime he has.
Defyle their women.
Kill their family.

That will teach them!
;)
Mwhhahaahahahahahahahaaha

I thought I felt like I was going to lose my hot dogs at Dave Clarke because I was hit so hard. Maybe not. I've talked to other people who were sick at the same party. They guy in line in front of me almost lost his hamburgers on me.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} My SDMF review :)

And exactly what did YOU add to this discussion, Mr. Disck [sic] jockey?

I am an outsideer [sic]?  I've been supporting many of the local promoters
here for years now, and NEVER have asked for anything free, always paying my
way, and thanking the DJ's and promoters at the end of the night when I've
had a good time.  Hell, I've given promoters run of my garage house and
storage areas to borrow any lighting, decorations, generators and such they
may be short on...they know who they are, and they know they are always
welcome to ask.  I don't really consider myself an outsider.  I don't go
around telling everyone how great I am or what crew I'm a part of like so
many others, maybe then that does make me an outsider, but so be it.  I
participate beacuse I enjoy the general sense of community and the music,
not because I want free drink comps and an oil change.

And I've never had a bad time at a Sphere event, so I feel the need to show
the GOOD side of the whole topic, and call someone who starts out by saying
"I was never promised anyhting" but... and tries to smear a decent
hard-working promoter.

Yeah, I have an opinion, just like you.  It's my opinion that Sphere does
good things for our community.  It is my belief that Brian is not a "shitty
promoter" and I think that can be proven by the caliber of talent he
regularly brings our way.

The point is, if you've got a beef with someone, you should FIRST discuss
the issue privately and then take it public if there is not satisfaction
given.  THAT did not happen here, and I felt Sphere should be given its
props for the support of our community in the Cleveland area over the years.

Sounds like you both have forgotten that you should be doing this for the
love and enjoyment of it all, and if you're in it for the freebies, and
expense reimbursements and such, then call it a business, you can't have it
both ways.  I personally see nothing wrong with calling it a business in any
matter whatsoever.  That's among the reasons why I live in America rather
than Cuba or some other repressing country..

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} quick demf re:view

  Richie Hawtin must have a thing for causing pain...
When I was at Epok in Detroit for millenium new years, the system he had set up was so loud that it pretty much prevented all enjoyment.  My eyeballs were vibrating, and when I turned my back to the walls of speakers, I could feel air coming out of my eye sockets from the pressure.  I remember there were 2 guys on the dancefloor in wheelchairs (taking up a hell of a lot of space I might add), and the metal on their chairs was rattling.  I spent the majority of the party looking for a corner to sit in so that I could have some kind of insulation from the 7-hour set from hell.  Plus, I was verging on nausea the whole time and needed to sit.    

**Note to anyone planning on seeing Hawtin when he provides his own sound--BRING EARPLUGS!!** (goggles too if you're a freak... hehee)  

I think my ears rang for 2-3 days straight after Epok...

i dont fuck around with any online radio stations except bassdrive... other
than that, you're better off looking for prerecorded mixes online from
dj's... i know soniq has a couple online www.djsoniqstylz.com, ratana has
some online ratana.chemlab.org, who else has some full sets out there?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} diary-review SDMF/DEMF

i know who he is.  i own a few of his records.  most of his stuff (usually
with christain smith) is a bit too proggy for my tastes.  like i said, he
will be playing that new electroclash shite.  that's what he told me anyway.
me saying 'i don't know how i feel about that' is a nice way of me saying
'electroclash 80's revival drivel makes me wish i had a gun so i could
fucking shoot myself in the face'.

not that his usual flavor of techno would be appropriate at shift, but i
sort of wish he would be playing something....well, other than electroclash.

Subject: {pb-cle} Looking for good music?=)

The Pacific Northwest's fastest rising DJ, Aaron Simpson,  has just launched 
his new website celebrating the release of his latest CD, Volume IV! His 
energy infused sets range from driving trance to progressive breaks to sexy, 
vocal drum n' bass, and are blowing up the west coast. For free downloads of 
all of his CDs, pictures, and more information, please visit 
www.aaronsimpson. net. 

You can also catch Aaron live every Thursday from 6-8 pm PST at 
www.syndicaterecordings.net!
You might be able to call Aaron Simpson an overnight success- but the night 
was very long. 

Since hearing the Trance Anthem Children by Robert Miles over 2 years ago, 
Seattle Trance DJ Aaron Simpson's waking moments have been filled with small 
steps chipping away at his greater goal- to move people through music. 
During the early days, Simpson would toggle his vehicle's turn signal to 
match the rhythm of the blinker in front of him. Now he finds himself 
matching real beats, and moving audiences with every set. 

Aaron started spinning in early 2000, under the direction of "The Funkist" 
(aka Dj Flave). Eight months later, he had landed a job at the only store 
dedicated to the trance movement in the United States - Frequency-8. Before 
long, Aaron became a buyer, and had an infinite amount of music at his 
fingertips. 

Starving to be heard, Aaron began work on a series of mix cds. Not looking 
to make a profit, thousands of cds were passed out, to anyone who was 
willing to listen to what Aaron had to offer. Before long, the name became 
familiar locally, and his career started to slowly snowball. 

It was the cd release of Volume III, which celebrated Aaron opening up for 
trance legend - Paul van Dyk. Jerry Bonham, Kimball Collins and Doran, are 
just a few of the recognizable names Aaron has opened for, not including all 
of the headliners he has been billed with. Headlining in Hawaii, Oregon, and 
Boise, Aaron has been able to spread his music through out the Northwest. 
Previous residencies include Groove Technologies, where Aaron had a weekly 
time slot playing for an international audience via internet radio, and 
Electrobox on C89.5- Seattle's only FM dance music station. Aaron has also 
received recognition in the Lotus, for his work with the infamous Remedy 
club nights (Showbox), and local newspaper - the Stranger, as "Seattle's own 
trance protégé." 

A style all his own- driving basslines, suspenseful, uplifting buildups and 
emotional, energetic breakdowns- combining trance, breaks, and now 
occasional drum and bass make his sound unique to the world of trance. Fast 
paced mixing, with loads of energy behind the decks- Aaron brings an 
intensity uncommon in trance. His latest mix, Volume IV journeys through 
twenty-two seamlessly mixed tracks in 72 minutes. Featuring such favorites 
as Miss Shiva's "Dreams", Sharaz' "Madagascar", and the Warp Brothers' 
floor-filler "Blast the Speakers". Continued studies in MIDI Music 
Production/Audio Engineering have enabled him to produce the intro on Volume 
IV, as well as perform all post-production and engineering. He is also 
currently collaborating with producers on tracks. 

Maintaining residencies in both rave and 21+ venues, with the city's most 
prolific promotion groups such as Next Level Productions, Beatlabs, 
Frequency-8, and the Last Supper Club has left Aaron one of the busiest DJs 
in Seattle. Nationally, Aaron's music is reaching the masses via North 
Carolina's Deep Breath Nation and Seattle's Syndicate Recordings. 
International boundaries were crossed when Volume IV debuted in the 
listening rotation on Digitally Imported, a European-based online radio 
station. Watch for the release of Volume 5 in September 2002. 

Aside from achievement, there is a message: "I just want to show the world 
the amazing things I have felt through music. Music has moved me 
emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually, more than any other 
force I have ever encountered. Music is life, be the music." -Aaron Simpson

OVER 2 YEARS AGO? wow, that guy sure has access to some seriously 
underground shit. i can see why his music must be so dope. was he 
hiding under a rock in 1996 when MTV was playing this track? is 2 
years after you heard a cheeseball pop trance tune enough time to 
make a valid track in any electronic genre? im going to say hell 
no. and i dont care to listen to find out if im right or not.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weekly.html

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Jun 07                SHIMON & ANDY C @ groove               Pittsburgh

Friday June 7th 2002
Pittsburgh PA

Red Tape Productions Presents


SHIMON & ANDY C.
   Live @ Groove


Featuring:

ANDY C.     Ram Records, Liftin Spirits, Uk

The Chiefs in charge of the entire Ram Operation are, as you should know 
by now, none other than Andy C. and Ant Miles.  Ram Records kicked off in 
early ’92 with Andy’s now highly collectable “Sour Mash” EP. Around this 
time, Ant was expecting his first child, forcing Andy to go solo on such 
singles as “Bass Logic” and “Elevation” in ’93. Once Ant got back in the 
studio, the bond known as “Origin Unknown” blew up with the classic EP 
“Valley of the Shadows”. RAM Records reputation only grew, especially 
after the track won Best Hardcore Tune at the 1993 Hardcore Dance Awards; 
as well Andy received the award for ‘Best Newcomer). In ’94 and ’95, work 
came thick and fast for Origin Unknown with tracks like “Truly One” and 
“Cool Down”. Threw various alias’, the duo released timepiece tunes such 
as “Beyond Bass” and “Here and Now”. Around this time, Andy hooked up with 
Randall to create “the Sound Control” 12”.  Andy also found himself DJing 
at major bashes such as Innovation, Desire, Dreamscape and Jungle Fever. 
Around ’96, Andy hooked up with Shimon to create “Quest” and “Nightflight” 
that took their names to greater acclaim.  1997 marked a new Era in Ram 
history as Andy C. & Shimon’s tracks “Recharge” and “Quest VIP” hit 
worldwide markets, bringing them the award for ‘Best Album’ at the 1996 
Hardcore Dance Awards; Andy received ‘Best Producer’.  In 1998, the birth 
of Ram Trilogy marked three classic EP’s, with this Andy went on to host 
London’s Kiss FM as well as performing at Ram Sessions at the End, 
Movement, Helter Skelter, Metalheadz, Warning, One Nation and other 
locations all around the world, bringing him the Status as ‘Best Dj’ at 
the 1999 Knowledge Awards.  



SHIMON  Ram Records, Liftin Spirits, Uk

You cannot mention the name Shimon without the images of his long time 
compatriots, Andy C and Ant Miles, instantly filtering into the same 
picture. Although the outline of Shimon is often blurred by the notoriety 
of his Ram Trilogy clique, he remains one of the primary colours of the 
Ram Records rainbow, and is very much an individual. Certain DJ's and 
producers within our scene have attained celebrity-like statuses through 
their outstanding and revolutionary work. Due to this it becomes 
increasingly difficult not to herald them on the lofty platform from which 
their achievements derive, and harder to converse with them on a level 
that does not smack of inferiority. Talking to Shimon helps to ignite the 
set stereotypes that have evolved from the upper tier of drum and bass; 
quashing any preconceived notions of a fixed social hierarchy in an 
instant. Requesting an interview from him can be paralleled to asking any 
one of the smiley faced, enthusiastic junglists you associate with your 
typical rave for a bottle of water; such is the honesty and enthusiasm of 
his reply.



MC GQ        Emcee Recordings, UK

MC GQ has been a figurehead and spokesman for the scene for years. 
Originally GQ was most known as the voice of the legendary AWOL, at the 
Paradise Club. Since then he has evolved in stature, becoming quite 
possibly, the most well respected and requested MC in his field.
Through the years he's broadened his horizons, venturing world wide, 
representing and promoting the cause. With a view to the future, he is 
currently establishing his record label 'Emcee Recordings', which is 
striving to encompass the entire spectrum of Drum 'n' Bass. 
Randall, Andy, Hype, Bailey - they all make him work differently. He tries 
to switch his style to read the music, "All the DJ's give you different 
energy". To GQ the inspiration comes from everywhere, It would be 
impossible to narrow it down to any particular source. Music inspires 
everyone, so listen and understand...

duh www.chemlab.org

our electronic station plays a wide range of electronic music (not just
rave)
we also have industrial (which is off the hook), soon to be added metal,
local music, and punk.

not to mention allot of archived dj set.

my highlight's of the past weekend:

ricke wade
jerome Syndam
George clinton
Record shopping
promos
hanging out with some of our international friends.
beatdown sounds after party
planet e afterparty
hanging out shake
meeting up with ppl from pgh and having them realize (i hope) why 
we speak so highly of detroit

lowlights

commercials in between sets, what the fuck was that about?
hitting a piece of debris on 75 on our way up, and having the rear 
tire on the driver's side blow out
not being able to find a rim, since it was memorial day weeked and 
every store was closed
spending entirely to much money over the weekend, looks like i'm 
eating nothing but pasta for the next week or so


overall a great weekend, but the festival wasn't as good as the 
first 2

and before i forget.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Anyone know anything about this mag??

goose's description is about right.  its basically full of ads for nudie
bars and trendy clubs.  the rest is pictures of hoochie mammas dancing with
their arms up in the air (what ARE they reaching for, anyway?) and brad the
fuckface whiteboy in his shiney silver shirt.  every once in awhile you'll
see a weak article between ads.

plus, look at who sent you the email.

mr. jesus christ superstar and america's most wanted asian by both the cia
and fbi, STEVIE T

I've seen it here in columbus for two years cause I used to know the guy who
distributed the magazine and did sales, the magazine doesn't have a lot of
substance to it at all, it's mainly short write ups about club events with
lots of pictures, I'd say that 10% of the magazine is readable material, the
rest is pics of people dressed to impress at club nights and advertisements.
It is nice that it's free, but I think it would be a much more valuable
resource if it had record reviews, music news, bio's on dj's that will be in
the area playing club nights or parties, etc...

  hahaha, I almost apologized in my 1st response for thinking it was

anything

sent my

that I
  thought was the coolest thing...it gave a bunch of different =
words/slang for

  male/female anatomy. Most of the words I hadn't heard of, some that I =
had,
  and a few I've never heard anyone ever use. One that I remember was =
fur
  burger. Ok, I'll stop acting immature. And with that closing =
statement, I
  think brown box is a good word for it too....:P

Subject: {pb-cle} cleveland saturday night

i'm going to be playing at abasso(sp?) in cleveland again this saturday
night with travis owens (arecibo).  we'll be playing from 10pm - 6am and the
music will cover many flavors of techno ranging from glitchy house to some
more bangin stuff.

the space is pretty nice with a decent sound system ringing the entire bar.
the bartender makes strong drinks at a good price too =D.  the only bad
thing is most of people there SUCK HAIRY BALLS.  so if any of you might want
to come out for a bit email me and i'll see if i can get you comped or
something.

yay

    -mike

I love it when people try to promote themselves by listing "headliners" they
have "opened" for, or been on the same bill with. Like this somehow
mystically makes them better.

LOL, "slowly"?  The kid hasn't been spinning for 2 years yet!

Hawaii,   Oregon, and Boise? Is Boise a state now? and since when is Hawaii
in the Northwest? Oh yeah, he's from Seattle, right? He hasn't headlined in
Washington?

Sounds like the description for most clubby trance to me. blech.

Actually, the most recent Now It's Dark issue has no nudity, we do have one ad 
with Columbus Gold.  I'm not gay, so I have no problem, with pics of club girls 
shaking their booty.  I don't know who brad is, so I can't comment on him. 
And there are more pages of article and pictures then ads: 21 pages of articles 
& pics and 10 pages of ads.  It's ads that keep the magazine free, so we need 
them.  And there *are* articles of music reviews, dj top 10's, as well as reviews 
of concert events and art.  The most recent issue features: 
* interview of dj essex (vibe productions)  - columbus's drum n bass dj 
* vinyl reviews of ian pooley's since then & jori hulkkonen's when no one is watching 
  we are invisible 
* 10 list by dj james brown (black & blue) 
* interview with blake seo - owner of amnesia, NID's pick for club of the month 
* review of the Run DMC Planet of the Drums Tour @ the Ohio Expo Center 
* pics of various concerts 
* interview of Queensryche's Scott Rockenfield 
* review of local bands Marblehead, Season's End, and the Johnson Brothers 
* blurbs by local artists jiminy cricket and musselboi36 
* spotlight on local artist jimmy descant @ duff lindsay gallery 
* nocturnal fashion shots by Matthew Roahrik for Cricket West and Plush 
* club list for columbus 
* event calendar for may 
* pics of Winter Music Fest in Miami, Florida 
* review of Mexican Cuisine - Beyond the Border 
* movie reviews of Spiderman, Scooby Doo, Star Wars Episode II, and Insomnia 
* and yes, a few pages of pics of many club girls cuz we love our women!! 
 
Actually, the one called Jesus Christ past away over 2000 years ago.  My 
name is Steve t.  Some people think I am the return in the spirit since I am 
credited for providing over 40 world solutions in a 4 year period (basically 
doing the work of the CIA for free) as well as being one of the founding fathers 
of the Ohio underground scene aka the rapture.  But opinions of me vary from 
person to person and I can not speak for them.  I try to let my work speak for 
itself, despite the obvious smeer campaign (launched by columbus's notorious
source of evil - jinx!) to try to shut down the scene!
 
thanks for remembering me, 
stevie t 
now it's dark magazine 
 
  "mike salamon (m.g.s.)" <mgsalamon@columbus.rr.com> wrote: goose's description is about right. its basically full of ads for nudie

their arms up in the air (what ARE they reaching for, anyway?) and brad the

see a weak article between ads.

plus, look at who sent you the email.

Has anyone else ever wanted to steal screen names from an AOL commercial and
use AIM, Trillian, or whatever to constantly IM them to death?

It's the lifestyles of the broke and lifeless.

Subject: {pb-cle} clockwork review


When I got there, it was about 12. there was a lot of people there, mostly 
the club variety, a lot of drinking, the usual scene in a large club. None 
of these kids knew who josh wink was, nor did the staff, and I thought tht 
was pretty amusing seeing as he was the headliner. ButI met doughboy and 
he's a cool guy, got a cd from him, pretty cool stuff. I found out when josh 
wink was on and ten I sat down  with the kids selling tapes during his set. 
I danced some, but I spent most of my time drawing, I get inspired by good 
live music :). A guy came up to me and asked for some paper and drew with 
me. He was amazing. Turns out it was UFO and he is really nice guy. I had a 
pretty good time,  met some cool people. I'm looking forward to their next 
event there, and I'm gonna try to flyer in pitsburgh for it.

You will go deaf even quicker, if you are thinking it's the
low freq.s killing your hearing, and opt for more highs and mids.

Those low frequencies, that make you nauseas, are doing
the LEAST amount of damage to your eardrums.

Subject: {pb-cle} DEMF - My LATE Review

--0-381642279-1022848494=:1195
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Yet another awesome weeeknd in Detroit. Although I must agreee the festival was better last year but hey.. The weekend was still amazing, the weather was awesome and I am already thinking about next year...
 Highlights:
Krust's set
Gyros downstairs in the food court - but WHERE WAS THE ROASTED CORN VENDOR!??!??!!?!
Kicking it with my crazy Cleveland crew - Webster, Joni, Brent, Amy, SPaz, Zack, Lucky, Mark and the rest of those fools.
Running into Jes and Halle right in the hotel lobby upon check in
Hotel afterparties - and all the mayem that entails
Seeing our whole bathroom filled with beer and champagne
Hanging out outside listening the great music in sunny weather drinking a cold beer - does it get any better!?
Making fun of the drag queens and making them engage in strange poses for pictures
Dancing to the last house set  at the Detroit Free Press stage Sunday night

Lowlights:

Missing the PB-Cle get together - was there one?
Security in the Rennaissance Center - escpecially Saturday night
Taking 2 hours to check in cuz our rooms were messed up
Being stuck in a bottleneck on the way to see Krust's set (and losing my girls briefely)
Missing the Hawtin party, AGAIN!

All in all an awesome weekend with a few baubles, but with 24 people and 4 rooms, things can get hectic...Hope to see everyone out next year for another amazing Memorial Day weekend!!!!

~~~ ROXY

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} clockwork review


Were you in the jungle room for the beginning of Essex's set?  MC Zero did 
this long monologue (sans music) that went through  and dropped names of 
every major jungle DJ he could think of.  I stood there laughing constantly, 
partially at the clever name tracks, and partially at the fact that nobody 
in the crowd knew what was going on until he said "If aphrodite's such a 
goddess why the fuck is he a guy?"

Anyway, I was in the Jungle room for a large portion of the evening.  I'm 
gathering you weren't in there for UFO!'s set, which is a loss.. he was 
awesome!  I want to get into that laptop of his.. mmmm..

My only problem with the event was the technical difficulties.  At the end 
of Titonton's set one of the turntables stopped playing correctly, and they 
had to swap it out.  I'm glad they had an extra tech 12 sitting around, 
that's for sure.  Also, after MC Zero did his little speech, his microphone 
stopped working.  For probably 45 minutes they scrambled around trying to 
figure out what was wrong before finally fixing the problem.  By that time, 
the crowd didn't seem to be so much in the mood for an MC any more.. and 
Zero didn't seem to have a whole lot of flow at the time either.

Got to hear some of Wink's set, and I admit that I didn't know who the DJ's 
were that preceded him.  I did my spastic dancing thing, which was difficult 
with the big crowd of sweaty people.  They had some fairly attractive girls 
dancing on the cubes, unfortunately they put them in costumes that just 
didn't work for me.  I figured I'd like having a strip-club feel at a dance 
club, but when I actually got it, I wasn't very pleased.  Oh well...

Oh yeah, and I'm spinning at a house party tonight.  If anybody wants to 
come, e-mail me for info/directions.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} clockwork review

Yes, by the time I got there I wanted to at least get to see the headliner 
perform and I was kind of afraid to leave the main room because if I got 
into the set in another room, I woulda stayed there and missed him. I did 
venture into the jungle room for awhile but I had no idea who was spinning. 
Not one person I asked had a clue about anything. It was a typical club 
scene, which I'm not that keen on but hey, if there's good music I can hang. 
When I was in the main room tho, I felt kind of akward since the crowd was 
led by the people dancing on those platforms, it was weird to be standin 
there surrounded by a ton of clubbers, dressed all sexy and dancin with 
eachother, they were all buzzed up and gettin in on, lol, and there I was, 
not dressed up at all, doin my own thing in the square foot of space I had, 
and if I took one step I was running into someone, haha. Not that they made 
me mad or anything, they were havin a good time, but it's not quite my 
scene. On the dancefloor you would get bumped, stepped on, ran into, fallen 
on, and nobody bothered to say excuse me or sorry. They didnt even give you 
a look at all. I can understand that because after being in that kind of 
scene you would eventually just get used to it and it wouldnt matter, but I 
always try to at least give someone an apologetic look. But those platforms 
bothered me. Most of the time it was some sexy girls on them, or some guy 
dancin like saturday night fever, and it made me feel weird. It was kinda 
like the music was right but I didnt fit in with the crowd. But I did meet 
some people that talked to and josh wink had a kick ass set

Subject: {pb-cle} Metropolis


I hate Metropolis. I have went 3 times this year so far. I am tired of 
stupid kids on drugs and shitty music. Anyone recall the song " Down, Down, 
Down, Down" Thats where Cleveland is headed.

I had to bitch.

Anyone headed for Chicago this weekend? See you at Max Graham's party at Red No Five on Saturday night. 

Will fortunately or unfortunately miss Timo Maas at Crobar on Friday. I didn't care for "Loud" like I have his other compilations.

Am I nuts? SDMF to DEMF to Chicago. Not missin' a beat.

yee-ah.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Metropolis

I quit metropolis 2 weeks ago, but am interested in why you are unhappy with
it.  When something else pops up, it would be good to have your feeedback.
How old are you?  What night did you go recently that you were unhappy with?
If you were looking for an alternative to Metropolis, what would you be
looking for in regards to music and atmosphere?  Do you go to the warehouse
district clubs, and if you do which ones do you like?  There are a few new
clubs opening, and a few kick ass nights taking place in the city.  If you
are into house, expecially the west coast vibe, definately check out Nectar
@ Funky Buddah this thursday.  Last month's event was quite honestly the
best thime I have had out in Cleveland in years.

Subject: {pb-cle} Twisted Frequency Tour

Hello all, for those of you who recognize the SN, its been about 2 years 
since my last post, and due to AOhelL, I rarely recive full list mail and 
have seen nothing about who might be attending this party.  I remember a long 
time ago there used to be Net Meets, at 2:33 always in a slick place (in 
front of the bathrooms mostly) and every once in a while have some great 
people draw up a large poster board with "Pb-Cle Net Meet Here."  Am I lost, 
or does this still happen?  I know I dont see all list mail, but its even 
more rare that I see the social partiers setting up the net meet. (I cant 
even recall the last time)  If this does still happen, even on the list, 
please tell me.  I have been silent to long I think.  Anyway, back on topic, 
not that i had on in the first place, but....  Who is going to be attending 
this party?  I just might sport the old school Pb-Cle badges, so for all who 
are going, look for me...most likley that guy who looks out of place.  If 
anyone who recognizes my SN, hit me up with an Email.  Would love to chill 
with some old friends, and for those who would like to meet, and chill, feel 
free to Email me as well.  Peace all.

Hugh D

P.S. If you want to respond to me, please do it privately, cause I might not 
get the message if you post it on the list.  Thanks

That's what you get when you try to squeeze implants that are too
large into the tiny space they have to fill. Reputable doctors won't
allow you to go any bigger than what your body can handle.
