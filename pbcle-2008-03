Probably the travel and tourism board of dubai thought that a weekly =20

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Grooverider? From what I've seen, his fans are not low sodium, they're
rather salty.

Extra spicy Clamato kicks V8's ass, especially in a Bloody Mary. Trouble
is, I can never find it anywhere.

VIRUS ALERT!!!

There is a new virus circulating. It is called "WORK." If you receive WORK
from your colleagues, your boss, or from anyone else, do not touch it under
any circumstances.? This virus wipes out your private life completely. If
you should happen to come in contact with this virus, take two friends and
go straight to the nearest bar. Order drinks immediately and? after three
rounds, you will find that WORK has been completely deleted from your brain.
If you don't drink, check out the Dairy Queen Hot Fudge Brownie Supreme!
Chocolate is a good substitute!
Forward this virus warning immediately to at least five friends.
Should you realize you do not have five friends, this means you are already
infected by this virus and WORK already controls your life.
If this is the case, go to the nearest bar and stay until you make at least
five friends. I think I have five friends, but I am not entirely positive,
so I'm headed for the bar anyway...it never hurts to be safe.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

I HATE TECHNO!!!!!!!

After a long hiatus, Full House Productions is back and proud to 
announce our eighth event here in Pittsburgh, 'I Hate Techno'.

In an on-going effort to expand musical horizons and educate people on 
the music we love so much, we are throwing an event focusing on possibly 
the most important genre of electronic music- techno.

>From acid to Detroit, minimal to tech-house, we have all the bases 
covered to help you explore the different sounds of techno, and 
understand how the sound has evolved and its impact on every genre of 
electronic music.

Our line-up will feature live PAs, as well as 4 DJ's, all right here 
from Pittsburgh.

The full line-up is:

Shawn Rudiman- Live PA/Technoir Audio/7th City Recordings 
(Detroit)/Finest Blend Recordings (Stockholm)/Pittsburgh

Thumptek- Live PA/Iron City Acid/Pittsburgh

Paul Alexander- Humanaut/Pittsburgh

Jason Cuban- Full House/Pittsburgh

Sat Mar 15                      BLANK ARTISTS                     Cleveland

As part of countinuing effort to bring in some of the biggest names in 
techno along side of some of the fastest rising talents in the game we 
again tap some of our massive regional talet to unleash their sound on 
Cleveland for the first time.

We proudly present:

Blank Artists
[Josh Dahlberg & Drew Pompa]
Blank Artists Website

Josh Dahlberg
Josh Dahlberg spent his awkward teen years in his bedroom with a drum
machine, sampler, and records, only coming out for school, soccer, and
the occasional visit from label mate, and close friend, Josh Cummings.
Despite growing up in a rural Michigan town, Dahlberg kept his ears on
Detroit as a reference point for his creativity. While attending
university in northern Michigan, Josh founded the record label, Blank
Artists. Now based in Detroit, Josh has reached many goals that far
surpass his years. In 2006, Josh worked with one of his oldest . and
most important - influences, Underground Resistance/Submerge at their
famous base camp on Grand Ave., which served as a learning experience
that will impact him forever. As a music producer and DJ, Josh has
shared stage time with some of electronic music's elite - which has
afforded him the privilege of playing shows from New York to
California. With upcoming releases that are sure to please, check out
why XLR8R has called him "a refiner of the Detroit sound...this
breakthrough artist is well on the way to making an impact on dance
music".

Drew Pompa
Drew Pompa, a.k.a Blank Artists' resident DJ extraordinaire, can
shock, stimulate, and excite all without physical encounters, but
rather by neuron transmitters that convey information through conduit
superhighways of the brain. If this bio is indicative of Drew's
personality, then strap yourself into the mother ship and be prepared
to take a journey to the backwaters of the mind. Throughout the
voyage, you will be presented with an array of dance friendly
electronica, described in the least as being deep, dark, funky,
quirky, yet remaining almost fully embedded within house and techno
sounds. In addition to Drew's passion for spinning records, he is also
a fixture behind the record

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April

room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Sat May 03                    HEAVY ARTILLERY 2                       Akron

Ewun
(Lifted Music, Human Imprint, Evol Intent) - Rochester, NY

Ewun tha Gun delivers tracks that sound like a robot with Turrets 
syndrome on a very serious mission. A hint of early 90s ragga-styled 
breakbeat hardcore percolates deep underneath the crust of industrial 
twisted metal mayhem and hardcore hip-hops sibilant cadence. Ewun's 
transatlantic influences have appropriately led to partnerships with 
UK-based labels Barcode Recordings and Lifted Music UK, as well as 
Dieselboy's Human Imprint. The upcoming year promises to reveal several 
tracks of grimey jungalist haze and aggressively smelt percussion. His 
latest tour entitled the Levitation tour is smashing across the U.S. 
sponsored by Lifted Music.

Nino Anthony,(portamento)-Columbus,OH

Nino Anthony, dj/producer and co-label owner of Portamento Records has 
always had a love and passion for music of all genres. He first made a 
name for himself in 2006 as a producer by releasing tracks on his newly 
formed label at the time, Portamento Records. His first single .Dance 
All Night. was remixed by Italy.s respected producer, Alex Kenji and was 
charted by several dj.s including Donald Glaude. Shortly after, his 
remix of David Farlow.s .How I Roll. was charted and supported by Sucker 
Dj.s. Since then Nino has released a whole slew of releases and remixes 
on some of the biggest labels in the world in including Subliminal, 
Juicy Traxx, Pacha Recordings, Eden Recordings, Play Digital, Movement 
Music, Curvve, BugEyed Records, New Era, Cubic, Wagram & Vendetta among 
many others.

We rocked out to a dope set from Nino @ May Daze 2 lets welcome this 
incredible dj back to NEOHIO!

Plus:

New Ascension's own Mark Roscoe droppin some hot electro flava's.

Also Men Of Leisure, Lovethang house duo Rick Allen and Arun, will be 
doing the house/turntabalism thing!

To accent the beats and the bass we have the graffiti stylings of the 
legendary WEBS, who will be showing and selling some of his original 
works!

This event will be going down at a unique art/music space in downtown 
akron, the Musica!

Beer and wine for those 21 and over with propper I.D.

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008        HULLA REUNION 2008 *cancelled*               Toronto

***CANCELLED***

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

or so planning the lineup and theme for our 2nd Annual Halloween Candy

"Education is useless without God and the Bible." - Noah Webster

"In my parents' day and age, [unwed teen parents] were sent away, they  
were shunned, they were called what they are.  There was at least a sense  
of shame. There's no sense of shame today. Society condones it ... I think  
it's wrong. They're sluts. And I don't mean just the women. I mean the  
men, too." -  State Rep. Larry Liston, Feb 2008

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Grun - Live in Ibiza 2017 (Doomcore/Breakcore Mix) !BSP!

I've made a new recording that I want to share with you all, it's a
split CD with the first mix (Side A) being Doomcore and the second
(Side B) being Breakcore.  It's called "DJ Grun - Live in Ibiza 2017"

The Doomcore side is a selection of PCP tracks mixed with some newer
sides which I think capture the feel of that early sound...

The Breakcore side also features a wide variety of tracks ranging over
the past 8 years or so, covering some of the newer artists of
breakcore but keeps firmly rooted with early tracks from Addict,
Venetian Snares, KnifeHandChop, and more


All details, graphics, and downloads can be found on the front page of
http://www.axiosrecords.com


If you're averse to visiting websites, here are direct links:

DC.  Any promoters that are interested, please contact me for a
hardcopy of this mix along with my press kit

30 has been the most amazing year of my entire life, I only hope it keeps getting better from here.:)
it really isnt as bad as it sounds 30......
Plus if 30 is the new 20 then that makes 40 the new 10? so by fifty I'll be in diapers again...
happy bday doctor!

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Mar 14                      I HATE TECHNO                    Pittsburgh

I HATE TECHNO!!!!!!!

After a long hiatus, Full House Productions is back and proud to 
announce our eighth event here in Pittsburgh, 'I Hate Techno'.

In an on-going effort to expand musical horizons and educate people on 
the music we love so much, we are throwing an event focusing on possibly 
the most important genre of electronic music- techno.

>From acid to Detroit, minimal to tech-house, we have all the bases 
covered to help you explore the different sounds of techno, and 
understand how the sound has evolved and its impact on every genre of 
electronic music.

Our line-up will feature live PAs, as well as 4 DJ's, all right here 
from Pittsburgh.

The full line-up is:

Shawn Rudiman- Live PA/Technoir Audio/7th City Recordings 
(Detroit)/Finest Blend Recordings (Stockholm)/Pittsburgh

Thumptek- Live PA/Iron City Acid/Pittsburgh

Paul Alexander- Humanaut/Pittsburgh

Jason Cuban- Full House/Pittsburgh

Adam Ratana- 412DNB/Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh

Jwan Allen- Technoir Audio/Pittsburgh


'I Hate Techno' will be held Friday, March 14th, 2008.
Doors will open at 10pm and the event will end at 3am.
This will be an 18+ event, and 21+ with ID to drink.
Cost at the door is $10.

This event is being held at the Braddock Elks Lodge, 424 Library Road, 
Braddock, PA. This is a prime location, only about 15 or 20 minutes from 
downtown.

The venue features a stocked bar with drink specials, a kitchen that 
will cook food as late as you can eat it, and has its own parking lot 
around back to save you the hassle of parking.

The Braddock Police Department will be providing an off-duty officer to 
ensure everyone has a safe, drama-free time.

Check Lolli.org as well as MySpace.com/FullHouseProductions for more 
info, and be on the lookout for the flyer which should hit the streets 
in a couple of weeks.

Sat Mar 15                      BLANK ARTISTS                     Cleveland

As part of countinuing effort to bring in some of the biggest names in 
techno along side of some of the fastest rising talents in the game we 
again tap some of our massive regional talet to unleash their sound on 
Cleveland for the first time.

We proudly present:

Blank Artists
[Josh Dahlberg & Drew Pompa]
Blank Artists Website

Josh Dahlberg
Josh Dahlberg spent his awkward teen years in his bedroom with a drum
machine, sampler, and records, only coming out for school, soccer, and
the occasional visit from label mate, and close friend, Josh Cummings.
Despite growing up in a rural Michigan town, Dahlberg kept his ears on
Detroit as a reference point for his creativity. While attending
university in northern Michigan, Josh founded the record label, Blank
Artists. Now based in Detroit, Josh has reached many goals that far
surpass his years. In 2006, Josh worked with one of his oldest . and
most important - influences, Underground Resistance/Submerge at their
famous base camp on Grand Ave., which served as a learning experience
that will impact him forever. As a music producer and DJ, Josh has
shared stage time with some of electronic music's elite - which has
afforded him the privilege of playing shows from New York to
California. With upcoming releases that are sure to please, check out
why XLR8R has called him "a refiner of the Detroit sound...this
breakthrough artist is well on the way to making an impact on dance
music".

Releases:
To Malaysia / D Records / 01.08
RS-232 Poppies Will Make Them Sleep (Josh Dahlberg Remix) / Blank

Drew Pompa
Drew Pompa, a.k.a Blank Artists' resident DJ extraordinaire, can
shock, stimulate, and excite all without physical encounters, but
rather by neuron transmitters that convey information through conduit
superhighways of the brain. If this bio is indicative of Drew's
personality, then strap yourself into the mother ship and be prepared
to take a journey to the backwaters of the mind. Throughout the
voyage, you will be presented with an array of dance friendly
electronica, described in the least as being deep, dark, funky,
quirky, yet remaining almost fully embedded within house and techno
sounds. In addition to Drew's passion for spinning records, he is also
a fixture behind the record

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April

room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Sat May 03                    HEAVY ARTILLERY 2                       Akron

Ewun
(Lifted Music, Human Imprint, Evol Intent) - Rochester, NY

Ewun tha Gun delivers tracks that sound like a robot with Turrets 
syndrome on a very serious mission. A hint of early 90s ragga-styled 
breakbeat hardcore percolates deep underneath the crust of industrial 
twisted metal mayhem and hardcore hip-hops sibilant cadence. Ewun's 
transatlantic influences have appropriately led to partnerships with 
UK-based labels Barcode Recordings and Lifted Music UK, as well as 
Dieselboy's Human Imprint. The upcoming year promises to reveal several 
tracks of grimey jungalist haze and aggressively smelt percussion. His 
latest tour entitled the Levitation tour is smashing across the U.S. 
sponsored by Lifted Music.

Nino Anthony,(portamento)-Columbus,OH

Nino Anthony, dj/producer and co-label owner of Portamento Records has 
always had a love and passion for music of all genres. He first made a 
name for himself in 2006 as a producer by releasing tracks on his newly 
formed label at the time, Portamento Records. His first single .Dance 
All Night. was remixed by Italy.s respected producer, Alex Kenji and was 
charted by several dj.s including Donald Glaude. Shortly after, his 
remix of David Farlow.s .How I Roll. was charted and supported by Sucker 
Dj.s. Since then Nino has released a whole slew of releases and remixes 
on some of the biggest labels in the world in including Subliminal, 
Juicy Traxx, Pacha Recordings, Eden Recordings, Play Digital, Movement 
Music, Curvve, BugEyed Records, New Era, Cubic, Wagram & Vendetta among 
many others.

We rocked out to a dope set from Nino @ May Daze 2 lets welcome this 
incredible dj back to NEOHIO!

Plus:

New Ascension's own Mark Roscoe droppin some hot electro flava's.

Also Men Of Leisure, Lovethang house duo Rick Allen and Arun, will be 
doing the house/turntabalism thing!

To accent the beats and the bass we have the graffiti stylings of the 
legendary WEBS, who will be showing and selling some of his original 
works!

This event will be going down at a unique art/music space in downtown 
akron, the Musica!

Beer and wine for those 21 and over with propper I.D.

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008        HULLA REUNION 2008 *cancelled*               Toronto

***CANCELLED***

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} JESUS SHIT FUCK

I have no doubt that I will live to be 80. As far as being a 30-something,
I'm prepping myself for ages 31-32 to suck, and then 33 to be okay. If
anyone doesn't know why I think this, never you mind.

I haven't yet achieved my dream of living out on some secluded property in
the country with my strapping younger boyfriend (whoever *that* may be
when I'm in my late 30's! My new goal is only to date people young than
me, and so far, it's working. My dude just turned 29. haha)

Turning 30 was such a nonevent for me. 31 was a little better. I'm not
thinking about 32 ... but have high hopes for 33. Woo-hoo, 33 I come!

Amanda

Subject: {pb-cle} HABERSHAM's return |  Friday 3.21.08 l Upstairs Z:Lounge l

Humanaut presents the return of Habersham
Friday, March 21st, 2008 @ Z:Lounge (2nd Floor)

You all know what he did to the dancefloor at Palm last year, so you know
exactly what he's going to do to the upstairs of Z:Lounge this time
around. Humanaut is proud to bring him back to dish massive servings of
pain onto your dinner tray. Yes, you can have seconds.

Habersham. The name in and of itself is the embodiment of twisted, nasty,
tech-house and break beat funk: music that can be downright rude to a
person on the dance floor. Hailing from Atlanta, Georgia, Damon Fonooni
(aka Habersham) has accomplished more in his mid-20s than most hope to
achieve in a lifetime.  With 30 plus releases under his belt, the biggest
players in the biz cane his tracks. Lee Burridge, James Zabiela, Phil K,
Sasha, John Digweed Yeah, theyve dropped his bombs. Some listeners have
described his music as subtle, yet pragmatic underground house that can
sate the pallet of even the most distinguished of aficionados I just call
it good.

Opening set by Adam Oliveri

$7 cover - NO PRESALES - LIMITED SPACE - GET THERE EARLY!

related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Apr 04              GHETTO SPAGHETTI ALL GROWN UP             Cleveland

So. I will be having my half-way-to-60 birthday party on Friday, 4 april 
2008...

who:

John Johr: paxahau, DETROIT
he is honestly the most polite bad-ass detroit dj I have ever met....

John Johr started Dj.ing in 1999, drawing influence from the early 
Detroit Techno and House sound. John.s sets maintain an artistic balance 
that blend a fusion of acid house, minimal and Detroit techno, a quality 
directly shaped by his occupation as record purchaser for Detroit.s 
famed Record Time. His status propelled through producing Input/Output, 
one of Detroit.s longest running weekly events and host to both new and 
veteran international talents such as Blake Baxter, Dan Bell, John 
Tejada and Ryan Crosson.

John also took up residency with Paxahau, becoming one of a select few 
DJ.s to represent the promotional powerhouse behind the decks. As a 
three year resident of Paxahau, John.s DJ career has further mobilized 
to include large Midwest events such as The Detroit Electronic Music 
Festival and opening for headlining acts: Steve Bug, Marco Carola, 
Luciano, Loco Dice, Marc Houle and Richie Hawtin. John continues to 
stand out among Detroit DJs using creative skills and years of 
experience as resources to provide an unequalled mixing display.



Random(seed): TEK-KNOW?-
Randomseed has been dropping tunes on a pair of turntables for over 12 
years now. No stranger to the future sound of music this versatile DJ 
has played events from Pittsburgh to San Fransisco, Cleveland to New 
Orleans and damn near everywhere in between. Starting as a house DJ in 
the mid 90's Randomseed finally found his calling in the evolving sound 
of techno circa 2001. The founding member of the Tek-Know collective and 
with an eye for talent he has successfully rounded up the best techno 
talent in Ohio and beyond under the Tek-Know banner influencing the 
tastes of techno lovers everywhere. In 2006 he finally put his taste to 
the test moving into the production realm with several underground 
releases currently circulating in digital format and with plans of 
launching Tek-Know as a record and netlabel in late 2007 there are only 
bigger and bigger things in the future for this prolific artist and the 
Tek-Know group as a whole. Having devoted his life to the audio art 
forms his passion is unrivaled and inspired. Switching between DJ sets 
and Live Pa's and even sometimes doing both at once you never know what 
to expect from his performances except the best techno beats available. 
He is also a contributing writer for Bassline Magazine


1-Auxy: TEK-KNOW?-
WOW. i was going to steal his bio from tekknow.experimedia.net alas.. it 
is a five page story that will not fit on this page..
all i know is i have known him since the 10th grade and i have watched 
him grow from a very bad knob twiddler on his pontiac grand am, into a 
very bad-ass dj.. it's been 14 years since i started listening to him 
and it just keeps getting better...

Sat May 03                    HEAVY ARTILLERY 2                       Akron

Ewun
(Lifted Music, Human Imprint, Evol Intent) - Rochester, NY

Ewun tha Gun delivers tracks that sound like a robot with Turrets 
syndrome on a very serious mission. A hint of early 90s ragga-styled 
breakbeat hardcore percolates deep underneath the crust of industrial 
twisted metal mayhem and hardcore hip-hops sibilant cadence. Ewun's 
transatlantic influences have appropriately led to partnerships with 
UK-based labels Barcode Recordings and Lifted Music UK, as well as 
Dieselboy's Human Imprint. The upcoming year promises to reveal several 
tracks of grimey jungalist haze and aggressively smelt percussion. His 
latest tour entitled the Levitation tour is smashing across the U.S. 
sponsored by Lifted Music.

Nino Anthony,(portamento)-Columbus,OH

Nino Anthony, dj/producer and co-label owner of Portamento Records has 
always had a love and passion for music of all genres. He first made a 
name for himself in 2006 as a producer by releasing tracks on his newly 
formed label at the time, Portamento Records. His first single .Dance 
All Night. was remixed by Italy.s respected producer, Alex Kenji and was 
charted by several dj.s including Donald Glaude. Shortly after, his 
remix of David Farlow.s .How I Roll. was charted and supported by Sucker 
Dj.s. Since then Nino has released a whole slew of releases and remixes 
on some of the biggest labels in the world in including Subliminal, 
Juicy Traxx, Pacha Recordings, Eden Recordings, Play Digital, Movement 
Music, Curvve, BugEyed Records, New Era, Cubic, Wagram & Vendetta among 
many others.

We rocked out to a dope set from Nino @ May Daze 2 lets welcome this 
incredible dj back to NEOHIO!

legendary WEBS, who will be showing and selling some of his original

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008        HULLA REUNION 2008 *cancelled*               Toronto

***CANCELLED***

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Subject: {pb-cle} MAETRIK (Treibstoff) + MAYA AMACK @ Moto - 2.25.08 - Pitt

MAETRIK @ MOTO - Friday, April 25th, 2008
[treibstoff | Morris Audio |  Tic Tac Toe | etc.]

Eric Estornel, under the names MAETRIK, MARIEL ITO, PLAEX, and simply
ESTORNEL - has been contributing to his musical world around him since
1993.  Always searching for the future of electronic dance, Eric has never
let himself be confined by the rules of styles or genres as he makes his
way through such a political and fickle industry.

Cuban born and raised, Eric has always been around music.  His father was
a salsa musician and enthusiast, and at a very early age Eric along with
his older brother and younger sister were put into dance lessons learning
all types of Dance.  They all 3 soon shared the dream of becoming
professional dancers and choreographers. Although a very talented dancer,
Eric was always a little more fascinated with the art of musical
composition and began experimenting with different acoustic and electronic
instruments.  In 1991 at the age of 13 Eric discovered a local Radio show
in Dallas, Texas called Edgeclub that featured popular electronic dance of
the time including Techno and Electro.  Quickly Eric grew infatuated with
the electronic sounds and intricate percussion and grew more and more
fascinated with the Dj culture and Production side of the industry.   By
1993 Eric was experimenting with mixxing music using old turntables and
tape players, and soon was able to save his money and buy a pair of the
famous technic 1200s.  Not long after Eric became a major vinyl junkie and
techno enthusiast with a broad knowledge and love for all forms of
electronic music, not just techno.
By 1995 Eric was a known and respected young DJ in Dallas, when he really
turned to the production end of things,  collecting and toying with
different cheap synthesizers and drum machines.  And by 96 he was already
developing his unique blend of techno and electro. Fast foward to present
day, Eric with all of his different sudonyms has gained the respect of
Djs, Artists, and music Enthusiasts worldwide.  His Discography shows his
production versatility and always evolving electronic sound."

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Apr 04              GHETTO SPAGHETTI ALL GROWN UP             Cleveland

So. I will be having my half-way-to-60 birthday party on Friday, 4 april 
2008...

who:

John Johr: paxahau, DETROIT
he is honestly the most polite bad-ass detroit dj I have ever met....

John Johr started Dj.ing in 1999, drawing influence from the early 
Detroit Techno and House sound. John.s sets maintain an artistic balance 
that blend a fusion of acid house, minimal and Detroit techno, a quality 
directly shaped by his occupation as record purchaser for Detroit.s 
famed Record Time. His status propelled through producing Input/Output, 
one of Detroit.s longest running weekly events and host to both new and 
veteran international talents such as Blake Baxter, Dan Bell, John 
Tejada and Ryan Crosson.

John also took up residency with Paxahau, becoming one of a select few 
DJ.s to represent the promotional powerhouse behind the decks. As a 
three year resident of Paxahau, John.s DJ career has further mobilized 
to include large Midwest events such as The Detroit Electronic Music 
Festival and opening for headlining acts: Steve Bug, Marco Carola, 
Luciano, Loco Dice, Marc Houle and Richie Hawtin. John continues to 
stand out among Detroit DJs using creative skills and years of 
experience as resources to provide an unequalled mixing display.



Random(seed): TEK-KNOW?-
Randomseed has been dropping tunes on a pair of turntables for over 12 
years now. No stranger to the future sound of music this versatile DJ 
has played events from Pittsburgh to San Fransisco, Cleveland to New 
Orleans and damn near everywhere in between. Starting as a house DJ in 
the mid 90's Randomseed finally found his calling in the evolving sound 
of techno circa 2001. The founding member of the Tek-Know collective and 
with an eye for talent he has successfully rounded up the best techno 
talent in Ohio and beyond under the Tek-Know banner influencing the 
tastes of techno lovers everywhere. In 2006 he finally put his taste to 
the test moving into the production realm with several underground 
releases currently circulating in digital format and with plans of 
launching Tek-Know as a record and netlabel in late 2007 there are only 
bigger and bigger things in the future for this prolific artist and the 
Tek-Know group as a whole. Having devoted his life to the audio art 
forms his passion is unrivaled and inspired. Switching between DJ sets 
and Live Pa's and even sometimes doing both at once you never know what 
to expect from his performances except the best techno beats available. 
He is also a contributing writer for Bassline Magazine


1-Auxy: TEK-KNOW?-
WOW. i was going to steal his bio from tekknow.experimedia.net alas.. it 
is a five page story that will not fit on this page..
all i know is i have known him since the 10th grade and i have watched 
him grow from a very bad knob twiddler on his pontiac grand am, into a 
very bad-ass dj.. it's been 14 years since i started listening to him 
and it just keeps getting better...

Sat Apr 12                         412 TAG                       Pittsburgh

Get ready to represent Pittsburgh as our locals battle it out 
in this tag team dual to the death. Well, maybe not death, but at least 
until the end of their set!

Cutups vs. Keeb$ (412DnB, Randomness)

Chico vs. Reson8 (Subsurface/Focused Motives, Electro Breaks/Technufunk)

Rukkus vs. Tika (Steel City Hardcore, Hardcore)

and introducing

The Assassins (1337, DnB Mashups)

Since we do anticipate a great turnout for this event, on top of a great 
evening, we've decided to give something back to the community.

When you arrive at 412 Tag we will be taking monetary donations for 
Animal Protectors, which is a non-profit animal shelter in New 
Kensington, PA.

Animal Protectors are a no-kill, non-profit shelter located in New 
Kensington, PA. Their shelter is always full of animals, many which are 
strays. Their shelter is a constant stream of activity. New animals are 
examined for possible problems, medical charts are checked and 
medication is administered, when needed. Cat cages and dog kennels are 
cleaned daily. From the time the shelter opens until it closes, there's 
a constant flurry of cleaning, feeding, exercising, cuddling, caring. 
Fresh food, water, litter boxes, and blankets are placed in each cage 
daily.

This event is being held at the Braddock Elks Lodge, 424 Library Road, 
Braddock, PA. This is a prime location, only about 15 or 20 minutes from 
downtown.

The venue features a stocked bar with drink specials, a kitchen that 
will cook food as late as you can eat it, and has its own parking lot 
around back to save you the hassle of parking.

The Braddock Police Department will be providing an off-duty officer to 
ensure everyone has a safe, drama-free time.

Sat Apr 12                       BASSNECTAR                      Pittsburgh

Saturday 04/12, Bassnectar with special guest Eliot Lipp
Pittsburgh, PA: Mr. Smalls Funhouse

A freeform project that merges music, art, new media, social 
involvement, and community values; dedicated to a constantly-evolving 
ethos of collaborative creation, self-reinvention, and boundary-pushing 
experimentation. While existing as a mutating collaborative effort, 
Bassnectar is traditionally the amorphous music project of Lorin Ashton, 
a San Francisco based Musician / Producer / DJ, (.probably the largest 
cult following of any DJ in San Francisco. . SF Weekly) highlighted by 
massive basslines, thick mob scene beats, freakshow energy, emotive 
melodics, traditional acoustic instrumentation, and fearless mashing of 
genres, styles, sounds, moods, and approaches. Fusing elements of 
midtempo breakbeats, big beat, old school hip hop and dub, DnB, glitch, 
IDM, electronica, death metal, grindcore, punk rock, alternative, folk, 
swing, and jazz; and sampling anything from the human history of sound 
and music, Bassnectar might be most accurately described as .omni-tempo 
maximalism.

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Sat May 03                    HEAVY ARTILLERY 2                       Akron

Ewun
(Lifted Music, Human Imprint, Evol Intent) - Rochester, NY

Ewun tha Gun delivers tracks that sound like a robot with Turrets 
syndrome on a very serious mission. A hint of early 90s ragga-styled 
breakbeat hardcore percolates deep underneath the crust of industrial 
twisted metal mayhem and hardcore hip-hops sibilant cadence. Ewun's 
transatlantic influences have appropriately led to partnerships with 
UK-based labels Barcode Recordings and Lifted Music UK, as well as 
Dieselboy's Human Imprint. The upcoming year promises to reveal several 
tracks of grimey jungalist haze and aggressively smelt percussion. His 
latest tour entitled the Levitation tour is smashing across the U.S. 
sponsored by Lifted Music.

Nino Anthony,(portamento)-Columbus,OH

Nino Anthony, dj/producer and co-label owner of Portamento Records has 
always had a love and passion for music of all genres. He first made a 
name for himself in 2006 as a producer by releasing tracks on his newly 
formed label at the time, Portamento Records. His first single .Dance 
All Night. was remixed by Italy.s respected producer, Alex Kenji and was 
charted by several dj.s including Donald Glaude. Shortly after, his 
remix of David Farlow.s .How I Roll. was charted and supported by Sucker 
Dj.s. Since then Nino has released a whole slew of releases and remixes 
on some of the biggest labels in the world in including Subliminal, 
Juicy Traxx, Pacha Recordings, Eden Recordings, Play Digital, Movement 
Music, Curvve, BugEyed Records, New Era, Cubic, Wagram & Vendetta among 
many others.

We rocked out to a dope set from Nino @ May Daze 2 lets welcome this 
incredible dj back to NEOHIO!

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008        HULLA REUNION 2008 *cancelled*               Toronto

***CANCELLED***

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs
