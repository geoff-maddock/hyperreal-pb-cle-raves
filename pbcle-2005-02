And speaking of Doc Scott and Mr. Fingers, Adam Bomb, you can ask Doc
Scott what he thinks of Mr. Fingers and he'll say "go listen to Liquid
Fingers and you tell me, you wanker" :)

Heheh I don't know I don't really see whats so great about that tune
but my ears are still open.  I'm looking for some other stuff by him
now.

I think the origianl point you guys were trying to make was that it
doesn't take months to write a track.  I would guess that most
releasing artist need little more than one session to lay down a dance
track.  I kind of related to an interview I read years ago on armad
van heldon who used outdated hardware (even then) to make all his hits
and he never saved anything, what he got done in that session was the
final product.  For me personallly, when I start vibing on what I have
started, I know I have a window of about 4 hours to finish it
otherwise it will never be finished.

btw I don't really have a point here, just opening up the discussion
again to see if I might learn something.

so side b of this is actually the original?

i like the percussion track from side a better, but it does get annoying

minimal....

the original original is this record right here:

http://www.discogs.com/release/1948

on which there is no vocal whatsoever on top of "can you feel it"

>i like the percussion track from side a better, but it does get
annoying
>with the "jack's house" thing. it's such a lush sound for being so
>minimal....

if youve never heard "Washing machine" i highly suggest you find
it, i know theres mp3s around. all it is is a drum machine, a
bassline, and a delay on the master bus. its pretty brilliant
really. and yeah its all about those pads on can you feel it.
those are just ridiculous. but you can easily count the number of
total elements in the track on one hand. larry heard is the man at
getting the most from the least amount of elements. he should be
everyone's hero.

honestly, larry heard has released so much amazing music that its
impossible to even pin down just a couple records by him to listen
to to really grasp his greatness. even his new stuff is good and
hes been at it for 20 years! the instrumental is not really the
instrumental since its what its supposed to sound like, but that
is the one to hear. ive got mp3s of a bunch of his albums that are
impossible to find if anyone wants me to upload them. 

liquid fingers is not a bad track, but it came out the same day
"the way you make me feel" by MIST did on the same label and i
passed on it because it just couldnt stand up to the MIST cuts....

nice, so was that digital. thats an alright label for sure.

the original original is this record right here:

http://www.discogs.com/release/1948

on which there is no vocal whatsoever on top of "can you feel it"

annoying

>minimal....

if youve never heard "Washing machine" i highly suggest you find
it, i know theres mp3s around. all it is is a drum machine, a
bassline, and a delay on the master bus. its pretty brilliant
really. and yeah its all about those pads on can you feel it.
those are just ridiculous. but you can easily count the number of
total elements in the track on one hand. larry heard is the man at
getting the most from the least amount of elements. he should be
everyone's hero.

yeah you did, i forgot about that. 

>juno has a copy on Trax. i think i might splurge.

that 12" is so worth it. you might be able to find it
domestically, check gemm.com maybe. just put it on again last
night to soak it in in its true vinyl representation and it
sounded so so nice. mp3s through computer speakers just dont do
that 12" justice....

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

~ ~ Who:               
 
 ~ Kimball Collins
          
Kimball Collins is one of America's most respected and renowned 
Progressive House/Trance DJ's. Over the past 16 years, Kimball 
transcended from Florida's local hero as resident of cornerstone venue, 
AHZZ, in Orlando, to revered world-class artist, jet setting throughout 
Europe, Asia and the United States in the elusive arena of top American 
DJ talent. As one of the initial global dance ambassadors, Kimball was 
one of the first American DJ's to play at the prestigious Ministry of 
Sound and Renaissance in the United Kingdom.
In the grand tradition of a master artist, Kimball evolved in 2004, and 
he has taken his style to a new level of Progressive Breaks and House. 
His graceful move into another genre, and ever expanding repertoire will 
certainly cement his place in history as one of the more dynamic DJs to 
ever grace the decks. Fortunately, Kimball is an artist that understands 
growth is essential and he welcomes this change in the music.
Kimball Collins... a 'do not miss' performance this year.

Thu Feb 24                       DJ SKRIBBLE                      Cleveland

Wish Nightclub is pleased to announce, coming back to Cleveland, DJ 
Skribble...on Thursday, February 24rd, 2004...

Selecting a house and hip hop set...

On "ESSENTIAL DANCE 2000," Atlantic's first joint release with the 
Warner Essential label, the one-and-only DJ Skribble spins pop, house, 
electronica, hip hop and progressive trance into a boombastic 
multi-artist mix which makes it perfectly clear why MTVs own superstar 
DJ is tops both in his field and on the dance floor. Capturing all the 
vibe and vitality of a live Skribble club set, " "ESSENTIAL DANCE 2000" 
"sees this master dj blending hit tracks - from an eclectic array of 
musicians such as Moby, Cher, Filter, William Orbit, the Vengaboys, 
Fragma, and even Bob Marley - with his own idiosyncratic brand of 
anything-goes mixing. "A DJ should be able to go into any kind of party 
and adapt to any kind of situation," Skribble says. "If youre not 
versatile, you just trap yourself into a corner. I pride myself on 
trying to play many different styles of music. I can go to a hardcore 
hip hop club, play for those kids, then go to a hardcore rave and play 
the hardest trance set. What makes a great DJ is the ability to play for 
anybody."

Hello,

Electronic Music Festival, this year. If you have questions please
direct them to the City of Detroit itself. 313.224.3400.

Thank you for your previous support of our event, we deeply regret that
we cannot accomodate the city, the world, and the electronic music

We send our deepest apologies enveloped within memories of the most
triumphant and vivacious live music festival across the globe.

Thank You and Kind Regards,

Subject: 	hi, bye

From: 	David Chung <dchung54c@yahoo.com>



hey trout. can you forward this to publicles? thanks.

-david

hey pb-cle. spyboy david here from nyc. i haven't used
that name or been on this list in a while, and i'm so
different now from what i was when i came here just 18
months ago. i'm leaving the country soon and i want to
say bye to some good friends from here. i miss yinz.

there were some funny characters on this list when i
came to the pgh scene from nyu in 96. dan with the
beard from cmu, joe lesesne, dan with the corvette
from cleveland, st*vi* t, trout, tom cox, trankie g,
absolut, seth crazybaum, michael mskw1, jeff brick,
don wizard workshop, stickman, john house of styles,
kelly carter queen of the pittsburgh rave scene,
glenn, kerem, alyssa & steve and the plur project,
andy the pooh, neki (congratulations), geekboy henry
from london, jenn the future consortium, andy brew,
andy toth (who is my friend here in nyc - see rave
friendships do last) (and some end in marriage), zone,
costa marinakos (who i talk to in nyc), erica coslor,
adam ratana, dori minnis, dan pihlblad ... there are
many more who were never on this list. 

so. ive been reading, shopping, planning,
procrastinating, all while working a lot, and finally
im ready to go away.

now...eliminate possessions in NYC
sat 2/05 drive to Pittsburgh; visit family
thu 2/10 fly to San Francisco; travel Northern
California
sun 2/13 fly to Seoul
mon 2/14 lose Valentines Day to international
meridian
tue 2/15 arrive Seoul; store baggage with family
thu 2/17fly to Beijing; travel
fri 2/25 arrive in Shanghai (somehow???)
fri 2/25 fly to Seoul; begin teacher orientation
we  3/02 classes begin; work as English teacher at
public elementary school
6/25-6/28 miss Sokol National Slet in Chicago
(important gymnastics/fitness conference)
fri 7/21 classes end
*
sat 7/23 fly to NYC (from Seoul)
sun 7/24 fly to Pittsburgh (and do???)
mon 8/29 fly to Nevada for Burning Man
sat 9/3 "burn" on my birthday
mon 9/5 fly to ???

* At this point, I may stay in Asia for the summer
(somewhere??? doing??? ), then teach for another
semester, either at the same school, or with another
program in Korea, or somewhere else (???).

After I finish teaching in Korea (or wherever), I will
return to NYC to teach for a semester or two with
my current institutions, if I need to stall. But
if Im ready, Ill skip that part and go directly to the
Peace Corps (somewhere), and then acquire my MSEd
(somewhere in NYC) so I can teach more. Also, I
hope to attend the Sokol International Slet (a really
important gymnastics/fitness conference) in
Prague, Czech Republic, June 24-27, 2006.

WHEW!!! SO THATS THE PLAN!!! You have no idea how
much reading, shopping, pennypinching, and
organizing has gone in to creating this plan. I
feel like Im at the point where I should have
been ten years ago, you know, when people ask you,
"What do you want to do when you grow up?"

So I need you all to make sure I have your email
and postal address, and send a picture or two for
me to take. (even if I have to print it out from
an email or website) Also, please share any useful
info or contacts you have in Asia. You can call me
up until I leave the States on 2/13. You know,
when I moved to NY, I had to get used to using the
phone to stay close to my friends and family. Now
I guess Ill have to get used to using email more.
And resurrect my online diary. I pray that nothing
bad happens to you or any of my friends or family
when Im gone. Im gonna miss everyone so much, I
almost dont want to go. I love my friends, my
family, my work, my children, my food, my music, my
cockroaches :) I cant believe how much Ive
changed since I moved to New York, into someone I
am almost happy with. I'm sooo excited!

Love,
David Chung

PS, anyone in NYC, I have a ton of stuff to get rid
of:
- dresser with bookcase
- fullsize bed
- twin bed
- nightstand with a big mirror
- armoire
- coffee table
- la-z-boy
- kitchen table with chairs
- bookshelves (2)
- three carts
- computer desk and chair
- audio equipment
- art supplies
- plants
- organic food
- etc
Basically, an entire apartment. Please take it.
Please hurry. (The sofa and electric scooter are
already taken.) Bye!

good list of people there. i forgot about some of these guys.
looking through the archives could easily make a great "where are
they now" project for someone who isnt lazy.

Subject: {pb-cle} soulseek + dsl

ok gang. i need some minor technical support.

i recently got dsl. i have a wireless router.

i followed the instructions for port-forwarding to allow people to download
from me in soulseek. i even went to their website to test it out, and it
says it works. however, people are still unable to download from me.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} soulseek + dsl

Are you running a Windows XP Firewall, as well?

Also, some of the Soulseek FAQ's list a specific port to open.  You 
might want to ignore that, and go into the app, click options, general 
options, and see what's listed as the 'listening port'.

On that screen, in the latest version, there's now a 'test firewall and 
router settings' button.  Click that, and let me know.

nope. 2kPro, no firewall software.

did that.

"IP: 70.20.99.170 Port: 2234/tcp open. Your router and Soulseek client is
configured correctly."

but that's the same thing i got last time.

i'm "hypnotyza" on soulseek...someone in front of theirs wanna give it a
shot and see if you can download from me?

Subject: {pb-cle} Matrix 3 Numark Mixer on sale...

I have a peep from down south wishing to sell his Matrix 3 Numark mixer.  The
mixer has only came out the box just once, and is practically brand new, aka,
never been used.  I have other financial obligations right now, or I might have
been interested.  I thought I'd pass this on.  The mixer's on sale for $250.00. 
The contact info is monk7923@aol.com & his name is Tony.  Hit him up if you're
interested, and tell him that the Coach sent you.  You never know, he might
hook you up with something extra.  Peace out!!


Coach

I just returned from a month in Germany and while in customs in Chicago I witnessed some
unbelievable attitudes by our customs "officials".
Mainly severe verbal abuse of individuals who obviously didn't understand English, and threats of immediate deportation for not filling out information in the correct boxes.
The German and French customs officials were infinitely more respectful of their visitors.

i never heard of him until the grey album.  and i still haven't 
listened.  and probably never will.
so he's famous not for his music, just over copyright infringement......

None of this surprises me in the least bit.  Been going to toronto a lot 
lately and when coming back into america, MY OWN FREAKIN COUNTRY, I am 
more anxious because I've heard of people that have their cars 
completely dissassembled (weren't carrying anything) and even without 
that they still just generally act like assholes.  It's the only reason 
I don't like going to toronto.  I have never had a single problem on the 
canadian side.

Subject: {pb-cle} Raiding the 20th Century

http://www.djfood.org/

'Everything Has To End...'

"On January 18th 2004, Strictly Kev premiered the original 'Raiding The 
20th Century' on XFM's 'The Remix' show in London. It was a 40 minute 
attempt to catalogue the history of cut up music - be it avant garde 
tape manipulation, turntable megamixes or bastard pop mash ups. It 
rapidly spread throughout the web and managed to cause a full scale 
server crash on boomselection.info when they hosted it due to the volume 
of net traffic.

Shortly afterwards he read Paul Morley's recently published book 'Words 
& Music' and was amazed that certain chapters mirrored parts of his mix. 
Apart from the fact that the title, 'Raiding the 20th Century' was 
coined by Morley 20 years before for a future Art of Noise project, he 
also featured Alvin Lucier who - purely by chance - was sampled on the 
opening track of the mix.

Kev decided to expand his idea to make the defnitive document on cut up 
music including many other parts, omitted by the constraints of the 
original radio session. After months of further research he tracked 
Morley down and they recorded passages from 'Words & Music' specially 
for this mix in an attempt to marry the two and finish something that 
neither of them actually started. A year to the day of the original 
airing, the newly expanded version is ready."

A heads up to all..... Our first hotel is completely booked so we have =
another block of 80 rooms right across the causeway (2 minutes from the =
beach/15 minutes from the airport). =20

This is your LAST CHANCE to reserve rooms at the Premiere Artists Group =
Rate of $129 per night plus tax.  If you haven't already checked you =
can't find a hotel room on the beach for less than $300 or more.  To get =
this rate you must email andrea@premiereartistsgroup.com by TOMORROW to =
hold your room or we will have to release them.

all we will need from you is the name for the reservation, how many =
rooms you need, if you need a single or double room, the dates you will =
be arriving, and the date you are departing. Conference is late this =
year and runs from Tuesday, March 22 through Saturday, March 26, 2005.  =
It is also Easter week so thats making it even worse for room =
availability. =20

Thank you for supporting Premiere Artists Group - this is our way of =
saying thanks for another Great Year!

best regards, =20

Subject: {pb-cle} in search of: that crazy dutch guy....

anyone remember when i asked for the file of that crazy dutch guy dancing
and singing to a song...

well, it's very similar to this file:
http://db.playego.com.br/orafiles/01122005120941567g.swf

...except the guy is older and looks more like Colin Mochrie from Whose Line
Is It Anyway...

DOES ANYONE HAVE THE FILE OR A LINK TO IT??? PLEEEEASE?!?!?!?

thanks.

I've stopped asking, forget who it was that said it that pretty much 
anyone that wants a gmail address has gotten one, at least from these 
lists since people were constantly saying they have em.  and must be 
obvious if everyone has 50 invites now

-------------------------------1107987122
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

We are currently accepting last minute requests for Silver's North American 
tour!!!!!!
This tour has a few dates left in February and March. All dates will include 
a flight share. Please inquire about availability ASAP (weekend and weekdates 
still available). 

The genre of drum & bass has always been about expanding boundaries and 
filling open gaps to create new, innovative sounds for the dance floor. Sonic & 
Silver, the Accidental Heroes, formed in 1999 for this precise reason: to push 
their funky, dubbed-out, atmospheric sound to a widespread audience across the 
world. With accumulating credits to many major labels including Metalheadz, 
Timeless, Virus, Soul:R, Reinforced, Renegade Hardware, Sonic's Space label and 
the duo's own Science Fiction Recordings, there seems to be no pause for these 
two talented artists.  
In addition to their mighty discography, the Accidental Heroes have worked 
their way into numerous notable publications, including Mixmag, Knowledge, NME, 
and ATM. The Heroes have had an impressive run touring the world over the last 
three years and are now returning home to England to focus on various solo 
projects.  

Silver has been working with BBC's 1xtra as of late, with projects on V 
Recordings, Emotif, Timeless, L Plates, and his newest release on Random 
Recordings, "The Jamaican Indian EP." Don't be surprised if you find him running around 
San Francisco, where he has been working with Gridlok and Hive on a few things 
as well.  

Please inquire about DJ Gamet available for select dates on this tour as well.

Please contact Charity Gallagher of Sublunary Artist Management for bookings.

greets-
  not sure if this is out of the midwest area (although I consider
  missouri part of the midwest) but there is an autonomous horizontally
  organized music fest this march 25th - april 2nd 2005 in the missouri
  forests and the info is at www.ahas.net with an infoline appearing
  shortly with directions posted no more than 2 weeks before the fest
  starts...basically it's a no permit fest where anyone is free to do
  whatever but since lots of musicians are coming with generators we are
  going to have music for the majority of the time--music is going to
  range from hiphop turntablism to hardcore/crust punk to gabber and
  happy hardcore--but since anyone is free to setup a soundsystem it's
  going to be extremely varied; there are a couple of kitchens being
  setup so there's going to be free food for most of the week and
  there's lots of other activities going on also--anyways... if this is
  cool enough to post on mw-raves post it and feel free to tell your
  friends

Saturday, March 12th ?

Koala Tea and Danger Room/All Crew are holding the 216 on?

LOCKDOWN


KLUTE
(drum and bass)
London, UK // Metalheadz, Commercial Suicide, BBS

If the term pioneer held any meaning in the world of Drum and Bass,
you'd find DJ Klute's picture listed somewhere by it in the
dictionary. With releases on such paramount labels as Hospital and
Headz, and with DJ gigs from New York to New Zealand, saying Klute is
merely a staple would be an understatement. For years, his tracks
have been in constant heavy rotation in nearly every Jungle DJs crate.
His label, Commercial Suicide, has boasted releases from the likes of
D.Kay, Calibre, Digital, and Total Science. Now with the highly
acclaimed release of his 4th LP last December, his latest mix CD for the
Metalheadz Americas, and having just been featured on the cover of the
infamous Knowledge Magazine, it's safe to say the reign of Klute has
begun!

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Feb 11                     KIMBALL COLLINS                     Columbus

~ ~ Who:               
 
 ~ Kimball Collins
          
Kimball Collins is one of America's most respected and renowned 
Progressive House/Trance DJ's. Over the past 16 years, Kimball 
transcended from Florida's local hero as resident of cornerstone venue, 
AHZZ, in Orlando, to revered world-class artist, jet setting throughout 
Europe, Asia and the United States in the elusive arena of top American 
DJ talent. As one of the initial global dance ambassadors, Kimball was 
one of the first American DJ's to play at the prestigious Ministry of 
Sound and Renaissance in the United Kingdom.
In the grand tradition of a master artist, Kimball evolved in 2004, and 
he has taken his style to a new level of Progressive Breaks and House. 
His graceful move into another genre, and ever expanding repertoire will 
certainly cement his place in history as one of the more dynamic DJs to 
ever grace the decks. Fortunately, Kimball is an artist that understands 
growth is essential and he welcomes this change in the music.
Kimball Collins... a 'do not miss' performance this year.

Thu Feb 24                       DJ SKRIBBLE                      Cleveland

Wish Nightclub is pleased to announce, coming back to Cleveland, DJ 
Skribble...on Thursday, February 24rd, 2004...

Selecting a house and hip hop set...

On "ESSENTIAL DANCE 2000," Atlantic's first joint release with the 
Warner Essential label, the one-and-only DJ Skribble spins pop, house, 
electronica, hip hop and progressive trance into a boombastic 
multi-artist mix which makes it perfectly clear why MTVs own superstar 
DJ is tops both in his field and on the dance floor. Capturing all the 
vibe and vitality of a live Skribble club set, " "ESSENTIAL DANCE 2000" 
"sees this master dj blending hit tracks - from an eclectic array of 
musicians such as Moby, Cher, Filter, William Orbit, the Vengaboys, 
Fragma, and even Bob Marley - with his own idiosyncratic brand of 
anything-goes mixing. "A DJ should be able to go into any kind of party 
and adapt to any kind of situation," Skribble says. "If youre not 
versatile, you just trap yourself into a corner. I pride myself on 
trying to play many different styles of music. I can go to a hardcore 
hip hop club, play for those kids, then go to a hardcore rave and play 
the hardest trance set. What makes a great DJ is the ability to play for 
anybody."

Could you add this too? :
 
This event will feature the body painting of exotic dancers by:

CAMILO PARDO

Camilo Pardo has drawn and re-drawn the Ford GT in his mind for more 
than a decade. Those years of mental sketching will pay off for the 
Ford GT chief designer this year, when hell be able to see his modern 
reissue of the 1960s-era racing legend hit the streets.As an 
accomplished designer, artist, sculptor, clothing and furniture 
designer, Camilos work has been featured on roadways  as well as in 
galleries and shows  worldwide. From autobahns in Germany and cafs in 
Italy to the walls of the Detroit Institute of Arts, to the stages of 
the Paris Motor Show, his art reflects his love for innovation and 
design. Being an artist really complements my car designs. I can't 
imagine having one without the other, Camilo says. Both require me 
to deal with proportions, emotions and creativity, which all lead to 
perfect execution.Camilo is a native New Yorker who says he knew at a 
young age that both art and automotive design would drive his career 
path.
To follow the dream, he enrolled at the Center for Creative Studies in 
Detroit, where he graduated and was granted the Industrial Design 
Society of America Merit Award in 1985. Immediately following his 
graduation, he joined Fords design staff in Dearborn, keeping an easy 
commute to his downtown Detroit art studio and apartment, where he still 
lives and works on his other artistic endeavors in his spare time.


http://www.ford.com/en/innovation/design/designers/camiloPardo.htm
We are looking forward to having such a very talented and recognized 
artist creating his unique style of body painting at our event.

Sat Mar 12                        LOCKDOWN                        Cleveland

Saturday, March 12th 

Koala Tea and Danger Room/All Crew are holding the 216 on

LOCKDOWN


KLUTE
(drum and bass)
London, UK // Metalheadz, Commercial Suicide, BBS

If the term pioneer held any meaning in the world of Drum and Bass, 
you'd find DJ Klute's picture listed somewhere by it in the 
dictionary. With releases on such paramount labels as Hospital and 
Headz, and with DJ gigs from New York to New Zealand, saying Klute is 
merely a staple would be an understatement. For years, his tracks 
have been in constant heavy rotation in nearly every Jungle DJs crate. 
His label, Commercial Suicide, has boasted releases from the likes of 
D.Kay, Calibre, Digital, and Total Science. Now with the highly 
acclaimed release of his 4th LP last December, his latest mix CD for the 
Metalheadz Americas, and having just been featured on the cover of the 
infamous Knowledge Magazine, it's safe to say the reign of Klute has 
begun!

You must mean February from some years past. on the Theo Parrish cut. 
While not new (2003?) it is still a good one though.  I believe that 
much of his music will still be fresh in 10 years...

What sample CDs do you use?  Or do you download most of your music 
samples online?

well curt jackson, eric justin and i will be starting a
disco/boogie/early house and techno night soon and we will have
mixTAPES available then. no more online mixes, no more CDs.
strictly tapes. 

also, curt and i played at havana this past saturday and played
mostly boogie and disco stuff and we totally killed it. we'll be
going so again on the 19th, i highly reccomend people try to make
it out as we're playing songs that pretty much never ever get
heard in this city. 

BTW, which song had you heard before? 

i doubt you can even find most of these on slsk, aside from the
theo and the peech boys. so you need to come hear me deejay so you
can hear the shit ive been digging up. that fancy record is just
off the chain.

is there a reason other than nostalgia that u are gonna be using cassettes?
i have to say about 70% of the people i know dont even have a cassette deck
hooked up to thier main stereo, the other 30% dont even have one..it seems
if u want to preach your gospel of good music u should do it in the format
people will be most willing to listen to it in.

Subject: {pb-cle} Midnight Mixer 2005 Update

Just a quick post to let you know that Midnight Mixer is in a holding 
pattern...

In the meantime...  We organized a compilation from the audio 
recordings made at each of the seven 2004 shows.  The compilation is 
55 minutes in length and captures the range of sounds we heard... 
Maybe you will hear yourself in the echoes?

Further details, the download, and the album artwork can be found at 
http://www.midnightmixer.com

I do wish I had a cassette player in my car.  Having a mini fm 
transmitter for my ipod sucks on long trips and having to change the 
frequency.  Although i've seen some aftermarkets with aux in jacks and 
then there are ones that just plug straight into the ipod :)

well obviously taking it back is part of the point, but aside from
that i like tapes better for a number of reasons: 

1. i like the sound better than digital formats.

2. i like the fact that you get 90 minutes worth of music instead
of 75 or whatever you can fit on a disc. 

3. tapes are dope because you can have 2 separate things entirely,
one on each side.

4. if people don't have or use tapedecks theyre not real music
lovers. shit, i have an 8 track player, though i dont need it
since most stuff on 8track was also on wax. converting mixtapes to
digital is, for the most part, teh gay.

TOM!

The people want a CD or online mix! let's give them
one! I mean damn, we play a highly specialized set of
tunes that most have never heard before, the least we
could do to make it accessable is give them the option
of listening via CD or Web. hell, if I had Dr
Mindbender's lab notes...I'd do live brodcasts into
the subconscious to avoid all that "media" nonsense. 
 For the extreme Boogie/Italo/Electro/Disco
dorks...like myself, I can appreciate the mixtape
mentality,however.  Of course on a CD, you can always
index the CD to do separate grooves, man.

so in short, If you want a CD mix, I will do my best
to convince Tom.

and now, For Curt Jackson's Top 10 of February:

1 Weeks & Co. "Knock Knock" Salsoul
2 Engian "Secret Hearts" Delerium 
3 Natasha King "AM:FM" Baby Records
4 Capricorn "Pow Pow Pow" Emergency
5 Class Action "Weekend" Sleeping Bag
6 Mike Francis "Nighttime Lady" ???
7 Serge Ponsar "Go Outside" ???
8 Orlando Johnson & Trance "Somebody Save Me" Zig
Zag(who woulda thought i'd be playing a record with
the word "trance" in it? i hope my militant
technocentric brethern dont find out!)
9 BB & Q band "starlette" "On the Beat" ???
10 Gino Soccio "It's Alright" RFC
 
hey tom, I now have 3 delerium records! hahahah!

oh yea, hello...Im curt jackson, have we met?

I picked up the Alpine KCA-420i for about $40.  I already had the Alpine 
in the car, so that works.  I've never been happier, as it's basically 
like having a 200 cd changer in the glove compartment.

> 1. i like the sound better than digital formats.

reel to reel yes...thats cuz even the smaller reel formats have a wider
signal path than cassette...a 1/16 of an inch per track plain sucks...and
unless you have a decent deck with dbx(like a pro-grade 2 track or
audiophile 2-track), all the hiss ruins whatever u might gain from going
analog cuz the hiss destroys both the clarity and the bottom-end...bottom
line...if u have a decent a/d(even just a sound blaster)it sounds better
than cassette

thats valid...but cd-rs are now 80 minutes, so u are only losing 10 mins,
but gaining a world of quality

its not like u cant do that with a cd...u could do two seperate mixes and
put them on a cd, only being limited by the 80 minute time constrait of cd

thats ridiculous....most "real music lovers" tottally shunned cassettes for
the first 10 years they were around till dbx came thru with NR...i have
plenty of cassettes, but i never listen to them...why? cuz everything that
was on cassette came out on cd or i converted it myself...and even when
cassettes were still popular when i had the choice i chose cd or vinyl...the
only thing worse than cassette is low bit rate digital(lower than 192k mp3
and windows media)...and why is it gay to convert a mix tape to digital? i
dont have a cassette player in my car, so if i wanna listen to an old school
mix tape, i have to listen to it on cd.

i think if u are really interested in turning on people to what you deem
good music you would do it with the most popular format, or at the very
least do a dual format thing, give people the choice instead of forcing them
to deal with a dead format...its not like its gonna cost u that much more to
put out cds as well.

Doing a mixtape when you could have done it digitally is stupid as 
fuck.  Tapes die.  Digital media doesn't have to.

i'm glad the tom cox iz teh suxorz tape isn't required listening.  i <3 
my ipod.

in fact back when djs _were_ still sending out mixtapes, i didn't want 
em.  i gave up my last tape deck and threw it out like 7-8 years ago.  
cd or minidisc is all i would listen to.  right now, all a cd is good 
for is for me to get home and rip it into itunes.  and the tape deck in 
my car, i rigged with a cable coming out to hook up a minidisc player.  
current shitbucket has a tape adaptor for my ipod.  have i mentioned i 
<3 my ipod?

yeah, Delerium is a *VERY* rare Italo Disco/Funk/Soul
label. but no sense in getting rare records,hording
them, then doing a mix that only a few can(or would
want to)hear! thats nonsense! make tapes AND CD's.
tapes for the music nerds(us), and CD's for ease of
use.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Let's all gather round.....

Actually, it's a combination of both.  My copy of reason is owned legit and
I registered it.  Their website has shitloads of commercial refill demo's.If
you wanna know where I got that flute sound, it's from an ambient refill
released by Zero-G.  They have alot of other good ones to.  The Jungle
Warfare series is incredible.  Endless amounts of inspiration.

www.zero-g.co.uk

They have lots of good stuff there.  Top quality.  Especially if your into
results.  Another great thing about using some premade loops (in the studio,
or live) is it just catapults you into laying a track.  I've read about BT
taking two weeks just to make one 4/4 time, 16 measure beat loop.  I'm sure
there are guys who put that to shame.  I don't think I could ever do it that
way.  Sure it's insanely technical stuff, but it seems to me the actual
music creation isn't there in that kind of process. I would actually like to
find someone to work with that really knows loop contruction (beats and bass
in particular).  I've messed with recycle, but the version i "bought" seems
to have a bug.  I'm better at designing the pads and the atmospheres, leads,
and excel in organization and over all compostion.  The beats and the bass
are definately more of the technical aspect.  You have to get them to sit
together juuuuust right.  Something I haven't quite mastered yet.  Anyone
interested in maybe an experimental co-lab contact me.  We could probably
handle all business via the internet.  Maybe an FTP.

I agree.  Well, I can let the drum tracks slide, but yeah man, make your own
basslines, or at least let the original artist know your sampling his or her
shit, like, "Hey, I'm using your shit."

That's what I did a few months ago.  Actually, I remixed a track.  I made a
friend out of it.  It looks like a release on one of his peep's labels may be
promising in the near future... if I can finish these damn house mixes!  Thanks
to help from him & several of his peeps, I'm now beginning to drop some pretty
decent mixes.  Just thought I'd share that with the peeps here.

I do write my own bassline and drum tracks.  Sometimes.  Alot, actually. =
 I
might just use a loop here or there for inspiration.  Drums especially.
What do you call a guy that hangs out with four musicians?  A drummer.  =
Not
to negate the talent of a drummer of course, but,  anyone can program a =
good
beat.  It's math.  That's all.  Why waste time writing beats, when they =
most
likely already exist somewhere?  It's just percussion.  Yes, it is the
essence of dance music.  Show me a beat that sounds like no other, and =
I'll
convert.  It's the small things that make percussion different from onwe =
to
the next.  Only thing I can think is stuff along the lines of Richard D.
James, Squarepusher, Metamatics, Autechre.  Now there is some innovative
percussion.  Honestly, the stuff I have for beat production kinda sucks. =
 I
hat the redrum module.  I use it, but I hate it.  Drums on the RS7000 =
sound
like shit, but i can squeak something out of it every once in awhile.  =
The
beat creation for me is more in the mixing of loops.  I'll have a said
"house" beat, going with a said "d'n'b" beat, and then maybe program the
meats and potatoes drive beat on a drum module.  Whatever sounds sweet
really.

This is a really interesting (or strange, I'm not sure) idea.  I looked online 
and found a tracklisting for his "Acid Brass" CD:
  DJ Fast Eddie - Can U Dance?
  Electra - Jibaro
  A Guy Called Gerald - Voodoo Ray
  808 State - Pacific 202
  Rhythim Is Rhythim - Strings Of Life
  Kevin Saunderson - The Groove That Won't Stop
  Nitro Deluxe - Let's Get Brutal
  808 State - Cubik
  Black Riot - A Day In The Life
  Royal House - Can You Party?
  The KLF - What Time Is Love?

The one thing that's not clear from the various announcements I've seen for 
this event is how much it costs if you're _not_ "college and university 
students, faculty, and staff".

The sound of the drum matters as well.  All of that "older" idm had

I'm searching all over the damn place to be entertained on my birthday.  I'll be
rolling up to the Pittsburgh area in two weeks to party on my birthday. Rather
than spend all hours of the evening searching for events, I thought I'd hit you
all to find out if any of ya got anything planned.  I guess the Cleveland would
be cool, too.  I believe it's like 2 1/2 hours or so from where I'll actually
be (Wheeling, WV).  Thanks for any party info.  Peace out.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Let's all gather round...

drums are so endlessly expressive...watch a real drummer play
sometime...with the drums...its more about dynamics than the actual math of
the beat.

all parts of the song are equal...thats how great producers/songwriters
think...no one part is greater or lesser than the whole.

even with just doing a 4 to the floor track...if u are programming in reason
or any other sequencer for that matter, there is no reason why u cant add
all kinds of dynamics to the hats, toms, congas, and whatever other
precussion parts aside from the kick...hell u can even do it with the modern
drum boxes(pretty much anything other than the 606/808)...yeah the kick is
definately the center of any 4 to the floor dance track, but if u are just
listening to the kick, u are really no better than the pilled up punter who
couldnt tell programmed drums from a real drummer...but then again if u are
really good at beat programming u can fool the most jaded ears into thinking
a real drummer played on the track.


oh and by the way...when i say dynamics, i dont mean running your drum sub
mix thru a compressor, i mean actually programming the drums with dynamics
by varying the velocities of the hits.

I do write my own bassline and drum tracks.  Sometimes.  Alot, actually.  I
might just use a loop here or there for inspiration.  Drums especially.
What do you call a guy that hangs out with four musicians?  A drummer.  Not
to negate the talent of a drummer of course, but,  anyone can program a good
beat.  It's math.  That's all.  Why waste time writing beats, when they most
likely already exist somewhere?  It's just percussion.  Yes, it is the
essence of dance music.  Show me a beat that sounds like no other, and I'll
convert.  It's the small things that make percussion different from onwe to
the next.  Only thing I can think is stuff along the lines of Richard D.
James, Squarepusher, Metamatics, Autechre.  Now there is some innovative
percussion.  Honestly, the stuff I have for beat production kinda sucks.  I
hat the redrum module.  I use it, but I hate it.  Drums on the RS7000 sound
like shit, but i can squeak something out of it every once in awhile.  The
beat creation for me is more in the mixing of loops.  I'll have a said
"house" beat, going with a said "d'n'b" beat, and then maybe program the
meats and potatoes drive beat on a drum module.  Whatever sounds sweet
really.

Hey great mix, very nice sounding.  Your right that flute is infectious.  The 
reverb is perfect.  Is that a patch on Malstrom>?  Or sample from what>?  
Whats all the crying about the beat?  Is that a rex file at slow BPM?  Keep it 
up.  How did your gig go?

I use "Mail.app" that comes with it.  Works fine with me.  esp with 
IMAP since I can check mail at work and then get to read all this 
lovely stuff again on my home computer.  I haven't messed with 
entourage.  To me, entourage is Outlook for mac.  And since I think 
outlook sucks, entourage must as well (yep, guilty by association).

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Let's all gather round...

Response to Nick S:
Dynamics are a very good point that haven't been brought into this yet.
When it comes to programming within reason, I simply just don't like the
interface.  I do work constantly on programming my own, but in the meantime,
the use of loops I feel isn't really a bad thing.  You can still get very
creative using loops.  Ideally, I would like to make my drum tracks live.
Unfortunately, I suffer from a few milliseconds of midi delay, that I can't
get rid of no matter what I do.  All of my melodies and bass lines are keyd
in live.  I would like to the same with drums.  SUPER-ideally, I would like
to have my own acoustic drum set, and my own electronic drum set.  That's
just the way I would feel more comfortable doing it.  I come from a large
group of musicians, and that's just how I think.  Sitting and staring at a
grid for hours on end doesn't thrill me to much.  It's a necasary evil, I
understand.  I do work to better my own drum programming, but in the
meantime, proper mixing of loops is the best I can offer up.

if youre going to use loops, jack them yourself from records that
other people dont know about. dont use shit people put out on a
platter for you. that shit is teh gay. i still think its teh gay
that jungle producers use breaks they snatch from online. whats
the point? go find the records!

What are you talking about?  Ohhhhhhhh, the original post. Hahaha.  First of
all thank you.  Actually the beat for that was about 4 loops mixed and
effected together.  Flute sample was taken from a Zero-G Demo for an Ambient
sample CD. As far as the gig, I had ALOT of fun.  Still need more practice
playin live, but it's getting there.  Botched it up a couple times here or
there.  Fortunately, I was opening, so there weren't to many poeple there to
witness that.  The show was amazing overall.  C-Style through some crazy
shit down.  Of course props to The White Boy and his 3 magical tables of
killer trance tunes.  Then Dangermouse seriously threw a crazy set.  It also
helped that by that time, I had gone through about 3 pitchers of rolling
rock.  I've never danced so much.  As I told a friend "Very unusual
behavior".

Were you using rex loops through reason?  and what were you playing the 
sample through
the NN19/Kontakt or external sampler?  Just curious.  How do you like the 
Reason 2.5 upgrade, do you even use any of the new features.  That Scream<?> 
vocoder
is tits.  I have a copy of zero-g's creative essentials 3 disk set if u wanna 
copy.
Anyone else have anything to trade!?
Also check out Reason Freaks free patch sets if you haven't already.
Some goodies up in there.
Peace

and how would u even know if someone ganked a break or recorded it
themselves?

get off your high horse about that shit dude..in the end, regardless of if u
got the aligator boogaloo off a sample cd(which probably cost more than the
45)or bought the record you are still stealing...and if u can trainspot
someones breaks that well, they arent very well reprogrammed...but good
breakologists mash up their shit so well, its about impossible to tell what
breaks they were originally.

scream 4 is definately my main sonic tool in reason...that box can do so
much from balls to the wall distortion, to sublte tube warming, to crazy
digital glitch...i love it

im not a huge fan of the vocoder, its a pain in the ass to use...id rather
just fire up cubase and use the orange vocoder or cubases vocoder....much
easier to deal with.

it is a pain in the ass.  and the orange is tight, but tends to sound the 
same if u know
what i mean. (insert orange audio swish here).  guess it depends what your 
putting into it.   my buddy picked up a  reason tutorial disk and it showed so 
many hot tips it was un real.  it showed a number of ways how to hook the 
vocoder up with ease and get quite dramatic results.  its worth fiddling with.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Let's all gather round...

I agree to a certain extent...

Tom you really just gotta give it up man.  If you're all about digging
for breaks, why don't you show something for it?  Personally I think
it's nice to pick up the breaks when you find em at jerry's or
something, but I'd rather spend hours trying to learn some production
and get some production done than the same amount of time digging in
crates for breaks at this point... it's just a question of priorities
really.

I do own a copy of lou donaldson's alligator bogaloo on blue note and
I picked it up at jerry's.. but if I was to sample it, it would sound
like shit.

Also wtf is wrong with you on that whole mix tape tip?? You are just
fronting way too hard there.  Back when people WERE making mixtapes,
you never made any that weren't given to more than 2 people.. jesus
christ.  I really doubt you'll get off your ass to duplicate mixtapes
YOU mixed to hand out at your night..  eric justin I believe would..
but not you.. come on man :)  I'm calling you out on this one.

I really want to see the Mix CD happen for the night.
side note to adam: infos for your dupication services
will be needed, sir. of course, since you yourself
have proclaimed to dislike boogie and disco, would you
even bother with such a mix? hmm....

show what? like all the breaks on wax that you borrowed that you
didnt even know about that i had on vinyl? my collection of breaks
is pretty good for the fact that i dont go out of my way to find
them. scorpio, amen, etc. but you know i dont jack rhythm loops
anyway, just individual hits which i have a plethora of already
ripped and its only a small portion of my collection.

thank god jungle and hiphop producers didnt wait around for breaks
CD's to come out, otherwise this music would never have existed.

some people just dont get down like that. i love getting my

to a point i agree, but the idea of just going out and getting
premade loops is TEH GAY. its not that hard to jack shit on your
own, really i swear its not.

if youre overprocessing the sounds and not using the rhythm, why
in gods name would you use sampled breakbeats in the first
place?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!

see for me i think its funny when people get mad at someone like
puff daddy for jacking obvious samples, but at least he's choosing
something atypical to jack. you guys line up to jack the exact
same breakbeats processed the exact same way. thats so retarded.

Yeah, exactly my point.. you didn't go out of your way to get them,
but because you got them you think everyone else should be able to get
them just as easily, and the fact is, it's not like that.. so don't
front like you spent hours digging...  You wait until someone tells
you what the hot shit is, and then go find it, and pretend like you
discovered it yourself, and then front on it, until you've caught up
with your homework.  It's okay man, thats why we like you.  :)

> thank god jungle and hiphop producers didnt wait around for breaks
> CD's to come out, otherwise this music would never have existed.

But the fact is, many great ones came along after all the groundwork
was laid in.. and for them, jacking breaks was jacking stuff that they
knew ..  a lot less overhead there in truth. It would be like you
jacking your nofx records.

> >I do own a copy of lou donaldson's alligator bogaloo on blue note and

Why use that when I can use a cleaner sample?  If I don't want to make
stuff that sounds like shit, I don't understand why you can't respect
that.  Just because you want your stuff to sound dirty, doesn't mean
that everyone elses should too.  It's your choice to only like music
produced a certain way, but it doesn't mean that stuff produced
another way isn't just as valid.

> ive made copies of mixtapes for everyone who has asked for one.

Again, you're full of shit there man.. you used to have 500 excuses
about how your mixer was bad, or how you dont hand out mixtapes
because people should just hear you play etc..  again I'll believe it
when I see it when you hand out the tom cox mixtape to the masses who
come out.

As tom said, shit's too funky for me.  :) right.. really I don't
dislike boogie and disco, I just don't own much and would rather hear
other people play it and enjoy it that way, than spend extra time and
money chasing down records I probably wouldn't listen to that often..
I'll let you guys do the homework and enjoy it when I come to your
night.. fair enough?

Gotta prioritize.. I realized that you cant do everything or be super
into every single genre of music out there and be a vinyl junkie about
everything, without sacrificing something else (time, money, time
spent doing other things).. so I apologize if this offends you Tom.

<<thank god jungle and hiphop producers didnt wait around for breaks CD's to

i think you're oversimplifying and over-glamorizing the process of finding
good breaks.

i mean, by every account anyone has ever heard, loops started out as party
breaks...like GM Flash with Chic's "good times"...just going back and forth
over the same 16 beats with two records. the whole thing was just extending
the funkiest part of POPULAR songs.

it wasn't until later that people made it a point to find  breaks that
nobody else had...then crate digging went from "total nerd shit" to "art
form".

who tells me about these breaks? id like to know so i can thank
them. i use the same principles for finding breaks as i do for
finding good records: look for things that look or sound like
theyre what youre looking for and throw them on the turntable.
that atomic rooster LP of mine is a great example. i saw it and
thought "there must be something dope on here" and there was. its
like magic. when you look through old records alot you start to
get feelings about certain records. the feelings might not always
be right, but they help alot. theres no substitute in crate
digging for listening to a stack of records 2 ft tall. thats how i
spend my time in the record store, listening to shit ive never
heard of before. thats how i learn about music. 

>But the fact is, many great ones came along after all the groundwork
>was laid in.. and for them, jacking breaks was jacking stuff that
they

>jacking your nofx records.

so jack breaks from wack indie rock or whatever it is that youre
into on the side these days. if old school funk and soul arent
your thing, dont use their breaks.

im just saying, if you really cared about it you would learn how
to make your own sampled breaks pristine if thats what you wanted
them to sound like. instead you want someone else's digging work
done for you, then you want someone else's engineering work done
for you. all of course after having someone's drumming work done
for you. why not have someone else chop it up and rearrange it for
you too? 

>Again, you're full of shit there man.. you used to have 500 excuses

i stand by all of that. my mixer is ass, and especially recently
there seems to be something wrong with one of my tables that it
sounds all muffled. but thats not the point, mixing at my house i
have no energy. i thrive on playing live. if you want to know what
im like when i deejay, come see me do it. a tape or CD will do me
no justice. when i can engage a crowd with reciprocal feedback, im
one of the illest motherfuckers out there. at home im only as good
as i feel motivated which varies on my mood. and another reason i
like tapes is because you cant just stick them online and have
people DL them. they have to come out and get em. which means they
have to hear us play records which means theyre engaged in the
best possible representation of the music. i dont expect many
people to come out (we're talking about as highly specialized a
genre as there is in dance music, at least in this day and age
where what happened last year is irrelevant much less what
happened 30 years ago....) and i expect even less to get down with
the mixtape stylee. im not doing this for "the masses" though if
they wanna get down thats cool too. im going to do a disco night
because thats what i like doing, its what im having the most fun
playing and hearing right now. and i have a group of friends who
are as into it as i am who also wanna have fun deejaying within a
certain restriction. money isnt why we're doing it, neither is
popularity or any other reason. honestly i dont care if anyone
more than my 10 friends or so come out. we'll still have fun.

its not about an art form really. it definitely is about some
serious nerd shit. if youre not a total music nerd, you shouldnt
be making music with samples or deejaying. and thats whats up. and
crate digging has existed since before hiphop really existed.
those guys were writing over their records' labels so that no one
could jack the hot break they discovered. sure they sometimes used
popular songs, but more often than not they were using obscure
shit. it was about finding something funky that wasnt served up
ready for consumption and turning it into something useful. 

really its not hard to dig for obscure things. everyone isnt going
to suddenly turn into dj shadow by buying records for $.25 at
their local thrift shop. but they WILL definitely find some shit
for jacking loops from, theres no doubt about that. and their shit
will have more originality than it would from jacking premade
loops available for easy consumption. 

i cant believe that theres no connection between easily available
breaks and loops and the obvious downward spiral that dance music
is in right now. everyone is concerned with "sounding proper"
instead of being concerned with sounding original. if people quit
using sample CDs, presets, etc and spent some time trying to
really explore their own sound and soul maybe there'd be a ton
less cookie cutter bullshit tracks out there.

Chill pill brutha!  I'm pissing with ya.

Just tell us all how you really feel man!  It's okay bro.  Just let it out...
let it allLLLLLLLLLLL out.

I too have noticed a trend or two in today's dance music.  That's a motive for
joining the production party. One trend is that a lot of it's garbage.  Another
trend is that many of today's music just sounds the same.  Another trend
involves remixes & sampling: If Eric Prydz was able to pull off "Call On Me",
in which he sampled a damn 80s song and repeated that sample endlessly, then
maybe I am capable of pulling off something similar.  After all, all it takes
is one track, and all my student loans are paid off. I've noticed by paying
attention to music lately that a lot of music has got to be getting jacked,
especially music from the 70s and 80s.

I've recently read up on sampling.  Research claimed you may be able to get away
with jacking just one note or two... I can't remember the actual clause, it's
like "Fair Use" or something.  If you use more than that, you're heading for
serious trouble, even if the sample's not recognizable. The more involved and
experienced I become in production, the less music I need to jack, and the more
original my music becomes.  That makes me pretty happy.  Besides, with my luck,
I'll release something with jacked music throughout the mix and get busted.

Just thought I'd share that with ya.

thats hardly new man. i mean seriously, house music has been doing
it for 15 years or more, hiphop for 25 years or more, jungle's
been doing it since the dawn of its existance. anything with a
sampled breakbeat has done it. that eric prydz joint is different,
he got stevie winwood to actually rerecord the vocals for that.
but the fact is a song can become a huge hit without actually
having anything original about it. the classic house song "the
bomb" is really just a crude edit of chicago's "street player".
they had to pay chicago serious cash when that got rereleased on a
major label. that doesnt mean its not a great track.

i only jack individual drum hits or sounds. ive made a couple
tracks based around disco loops, and they actually sounded pretty
good (recently discovered one on a CD i burned of it long ago and
never marked it and i was like "this is dope, wtf is this?" before
i realised it was me ;) but i just cant get down like that.
however a large portion of the records i love dearly are made by
sampling disco records, so im not against other people doing it.
anyway, literally a few hundred or more records are released every
week with illegal samples on them, some even of extremely popular
joints that i really cant believe they got away with. we're
dealing with such extremely small pressings of such limited appeal
to anybody that its just not worth it to prosecute. and most
people just arent having manufactured pop hits like eric prydz. 

anyway, there's plenty of ways to make completely original music
by just jacking other peoples stuff. coldcut, dj shadow, theo
parrish, moodymann, pete rock, etc are all masters of this. and
lets put it this way, none of those guys is buying sample CDs to
get their stuff. i think most of them would laugh at you if you
suggested that doing so was alright. finding and freaking obscure
samples is most definitely a great form of expression when done
right.

[0]fm6 writes "NPR has a story up about [1]the first musicians to compose
electronic music. In 1947, Louis and Bebe Barron received an early tape
recorder as a wedding present. About the same time, Louis Barron became
interested in Norbert Wiener's book [2]Cybernetics and its thesis of
common elements in living and artificial systems. This led the Barrons to
create a new kind of music using electronic circuits and painstakingly
edited magnetic tapes. The Barrons music was featured in various
avant-garde records and movies, and finally reached a mass audience in
the Science Fiction classic [3]Forbidden Planet."

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Let's all gather round...

Tom knows his shit! I'm glad to see that not everyone talks bullshit!

Yeah, I failed to take into account SugarHill Gang, who jacked that tight-ass
disco song in 1979.  You're right, people's been jacking shit long before we
were born.  For example, Elvis Presley jacked black music & the dance moves...
YES HE DID!  Yes he Did!  yep, he did.  I remember that song "The Bomb".  That
mix was ill.  I never knew the song had a history behind it; I only liked to
hear it.  I agree that coldcut, dj shadow, theo
parrish, moodymann, pete rock, etc, would all laugh at the idea of buying sample
CDs.  I believe that is a waste of money, especially with everything that's
vastly available today.

I actually thought about sampling some popular music & releasing it as a limited
edition.  Everyone else is doing it.  I may do that in the future.  I'll see. 
Just remember, NONE OF YOU REMEMBER THIS PARAGRAPH, RIGHT?!

I never knew eric prydz got stevie winwood to actually rerecord the vocals for
that that.  The peeps back here are too busy in hip-hop, rock & country.  Thus,
I can get away with playing that track.  They think it's new, and they've never
heard it.  Sad, but true.

Who are you again? =20

A quote for you

"I've got some advice for you little buddy,
Before you point your finger you should know that I'm the man.
If I'm the man, than your the man, and he's the man as well,=20
so you can point that fucking finger up your ass.
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit
Then you bought one"

So, mr. music man.  Who is that?

a thing.  I'm always the first to admit I still have alot to learn.  I try
and imagine these artists your talking about.  I try and imagine them
getting angry when someone talks shit about their music.  They don't.  You
however, go on for pages and pages defending your opinions, and trying your
best to knock all others down in the process.  Your very passionate, I'll
give you that.  I would LOVE to see one of your DJ sets.  If your into
funky, check out Now Introducing on my music page.  You might be impressed.
I would love to hear your opinion on that track.

First track off cognitive chaos.  I do a weird intro thing using the KLF's
Church Of The KLF.  It was jammed out in a pretty short amount of time if I
remember correctly.  Maybe one drum loop used.  The guitar was a sample.  I
REALLY wanna know what you think about it.  I make music for music's sake.
Been into electro since I can't even remember.  Got sick of dealing with
ego's in the band circuit, so just went my own way, and started learning
this stuff.  The only reason I never considered rippin loops off records is
because I just got my own turntable setup.  I only have like 8 records right
now.  I really sdon't see the big deal with using drum loops.  Especially
when you just really start to get into everything, and have very limited
resources.

Who are you again?

A quote for you

"I've got some advice for you little buddy,
Before you point your finger you should know that I'm the man.
If I'm the man, than your the man, and he's the man as well,
so you can point that fucking finger up your ass.
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit
Then you bought one"

So, mr. music man.  Who is that?

its cool to trigger it with a beat loop...it'll also work as a high pass 
filter in a pinch...but with vocoders i think its better to sing or speak 
live than to try to sample and track it.

waves morphoder is really cool too...if u have the waves pack.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Let's all gather round...

for jungle at least, live drums sound better than synthed drums...hence i 
use sampled breakbeats to get the snares, kicks, cymbals i need to make a 
new loop...when i process the hits i dont tend to do anthing but run all the 
snares and hats thru the same reverb setting....and if i have multiple kicks 
i compress one so it sounds like the beater hitting the drum, not just being 
front miced...thats the point of using breakbeats to me anyways...try to 
make programmed drums sound as real as possible.

like listen to the amen, thats gotta be the nastiest most hype snare sound 
ever..but the rest of the break is kind of clangy cuz it was probably only 
micd on over heads or with a 4 mic technique...instead of using those 
cymbals u can use cymbals from say the rocksteady break mixed with some 909 
cymbals..similar pattern, totally new sound.

if u listen to most drummers play they all play very simlar 4/4 
rudiments...but they all have their on indvidual rolls and flams and what 
not...reprogramming breaks is all about trying to make programmed drums 
sound real.

Actually, Reason 2.5 is where I started in the reason world.  I don't know
much about past versions.  I love the scream 4.  The vocoder sounds like it
can do some sweet stuff, but I don't mess with it to much.  I have a vocoder
on my MS2000B.  If I were to use a vocoder in a track, i would probably just
run that through my sound card.  You can do some pretty interesting things
with it.
The flute sample was loaded on the NN-19.  The drums were all rex files.  It
was really just a straight up jam.  Everything except the flute lead was
laid out in about an hour.  10 tracks total.  I just mixed the background
(muted, and unmuted tracks) while playin the lead overtop.  It was really
just a fart tune.  I loved that flute sound, so I mixed up some shit real
quick, hit record in Wavestudio, laid the track.  Done deal.

just out of curiosity, why do all the new school ragga labels need colored vinyl gimmiks to sell records. yeah some of the bigger dnb labels do it but at least they press it on black vinyl as well so you can have your choice of sound quality over glitz.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Jungle Riddim 003  indeed

and just outta curiosity, what labels are you referring to??? i really 
cant think of too many labels that often press colored vinyl...i dont 
think it's so much of a gimmick as it is just a preference in color and 
style of whoever is releasing it...i know that N2o has released some 
colored vinyl...but bottom line is, who cares what style it is, or what 
label it is, and regardless of color as long as its good music thats all 
that counts...i personally like to see colored vinyl, without a doubt...

thats just not possible. anything in the vinyl aside from vinyl 
contributes to lowering sound quality. 

>it's being

virgin vinyl is one color, and thats transluscent brown. you can 
see through virgin vinyl if you hold it up to the light. it 
contains no dye or recylced particles that contribute to lowering 
sound quality.

troodat, thats probably right..its still gonna be virgin vinyl, with green 
dye...but it's really not gonna make that big of a noticable 
difference..sound quality also depends on the individual pressing plant 
and their experience and what processes they are using...bottom line is, 
the tunes are good, you should support anybody taking time to produce and 
put together vinyl, especially local folks, cause it doesnt happen too 
often...hope to have everyone's support...thanx!!!

greg cash who owns bumping city in chicago now put out a bunch of 
records here back in the day. really if you go digging youll see 
stuff by a bunch of pittsburgh people since the mid 80s, not much 
of it was good though. soy sos (more dread than you son) has put 
out many house music anthems and his most recent band 3 
generations walking has blown up pretty big. he also emceed for 
187 on their rock stone foundation release on your man 
soulslinger's jungle sky label back in 1995. 

as for cleveland, lots of pretty high profile people have put 
stuff out. mike filly had stuff on ferox, dan curtin put out stuff 
on peacefrog as well as his own label that started morgan geist 
and many other high profile labels. warren harris aka hanna has 
releases on shadow, track mode, etc etc in jungle, techno, and 
house music. 

thats off the top of my head.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} local releases?

nice...nowadays i'd say it's safe to say that hometown record releases are 
somewhat scarce...Tuffy Tuff had some local vinyl releases, way back, one 
really good tune that even had a video shot at the Homewood 
Colloseum....troo....

raw vinyl white? i dont think so, but dont quote me on that...i think raw 
vinyl is brownish/black...i went on tour of a record pressing plant last 
year, the vinyl just starts out as little black pellets...

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} local releases?

dnb wise:

kc has releases on human (dsl's label), canvas, g2, rawkuts, & bassdrive

pollen has releases aspect, perspective, rawkuts, solid ground, g2, formula inc, terraformat & rumble (alongside still life)

random movement from c-bus just got a release signed on the breakbeat science offshoot orgone.

then there is the weapon crew (andy sine, kaos, dsl & josh ryan) who have releases on moving shadow, liftin spirit, canvas, human (not really sure if you could classify them as entirely local, though)

im sure there are more that i dont have listed.

black vinyl has any number of bits of dirt, paper, etc in it that 
makes it black. im not sure what color actual vinyl is, but honest 
to god real virgin vinyl is like a transluscent brown that looks 
black until you hold it up to the light. its the wildest thing ive 
ever seen.

*Techno fest teeters; entry fee possible*

February 11, 2005

BY BRIAN McCOLLUM
FREE PRESS POP MUSIC WRITER

Detroit's financially troubled electronic music festival is again
teetering on the brink.

Kevin Saunderson, who coproduced last year's Movement festival with
fellow techno star Derrick May, has been in discussions with City of
Detroit officials, though no festival contract has been signed. He
said Thursday that if plans are not solidified within a week, the
traditional Memorial Day Weekend event will likely be called off.

"I'd put the chances at 50-50 that it's going to happen," said
Saunderson, who has also met with potential private investors. "I've
told the city that if we can't pull it together for this year, we'll
start working now for 2006."

Lucius Vassar, the city's director of corporate and civic affairs, was
more optimistic: "I'm confident we can find some folks to step up and
provide financial support."

Time is short for Saunderson, who submitted a proposal to the city in
September and heard back in mid-January. With fewer than four months
remaining until the holiday weekend, no artists have been booked and
funding remains uncertain.

To avoid a last-minute scramble for sponsorships to support what had
always been a free event, Saunderson has proposed charging admission
to the Hart Plaza festival, an idea Vassar said he believes has merit.
Because the plaza is city-owned property, such a move would require
approval by the Detroit City Council.

"Ticketing can provide a way to sustain the operation," Vassar said.
"Kevin isn't looking to make a mint. He's looking, as a pioneer of
this music, to keep it going."

Saunderson said he has met with investors about funding he'd need to
get a ticketed event going.

Admission charges "would be for this year and this year only," he
said. "I've been reluctant to take this festival as it is -- I want to
be in a situation where we can just get through this year."

Meanwhile, May has backed out after leading two editions of Movement,
which in 2003 replaced the Detroit Electronic Music Festival (DEMF) at
Hart Plaza. He said he lost interest in producing the event after two
years of financial stress, which he attributed to the lack of cash
support from the city and sponsorship difficulties.

"I learned that sponsors don't give out money just because you have a
great idea," May said. "The festival works as far as the public and
the media are concerned. But it doesn't make any money, and it can't
work like that. To try and redesign it at this point, when it's
already been riding on three wheels, would just be very difficult."

The DEMF drew hundreds of thousands of young fans to Detroit each of
its three years and enjoyed global prestige as one of the premier
events in the electronic-music world. May said that reputation brought
extra pressure.

"If you failed, you weren't just failing an event, but an entire
legacy," he said.

Saunderson teamed up with May to help produce last year's Movement,
which was nearly canceled because of a cash crunch just days before
the event. Staffers spent much of the weekend collecting donations
from festivalgoers.

Saunderson terminated his business relationship with May last fall
before submitting his own fest proposal to the city. May retains
rights to the Movement name and trademark.

The two have known each other for more than two decades, going back to
their days as teenagers in Belleville, where they helped create the
blueprint for techno. May said he wishes Saunderson well.

"I would love to see the festival happen, but at this point, with the
financial situation, it's a lot to ask the city to get behind the
event," May said. "The reality is that the City of Detroit has bigger
problems than the festival."

Saunderson said he is proceeding cautiously, aware that money issues
have plagued the fest since the DEMF's inception.

"Right now, we're just trying to get this to the point where it can
happen," he said, "and not end up where it always has in the past."

Subject: {pb-cle} Cirque Du Soleil

Noticed this a while ago but forgot to mention it that one of the Cirque 
Du Soleil shows, Varekai, is coming to pittsburg and columbus this year. 
  It'll be in pgh from April 9 to May 8 and in columbus sometime in 
fall.  Been to a couple of them and have always liked them.  Little 
pricey to some, but like I've always come out saying it's worth it, even 
after seeing most of these on bravo when then play them there occasionally.

I may be mistaken, but I don't believe they charge for any of the 
other festivals held at the Plaza.

of course not. but when youre talking about something that is more
youth oriented, its tougher to find serious sponsors. especially
for something like "techno" which has a plethora of misconceptions
about the people who listen to it. im also not sure if the city
ever gave any of the other festivals money, but the first 3 DEMFs
got money from the city. and i know there was lots of irritation
with the ford focus advertising in the past. derrick may's deal
with the city to get the contract for memorial day weekend relied
on the fact that it meant they got zero from the city. and really
with the problems the city has right now its more than
understandable, though they reap tangible financial benefits from
that weekend. like kevin sauderson said, if they charge money it
will be for this year only and i would assume this year will be at
least moderately scaled back. its all about securing something for
the future as opposed to just trying to sneak one more free one in
before no one wants to put up with doing it anymore......

Subject: {pb-cle} fun samples

I've been looking for alternate entertainment sources since I've been 
laid up, and I've recently found a wealth of kookery on shortwave radio.

I've made some recordings, and they're a hoot, check em out if you like, 
I only thought to post them here as some of them are ultra sample-able:

some arty indie label a couple years ago released this CD comp
that ive been meaning to hunt down of these "number" radio things
where people just read numbers. i guess its some sort of code or
whatever, but they have recordings of it from all over the world.
its pretty awesome, just listening to them is pretty entrancing.
if anyone knows what im talking about could you let me know more
about it? ive been hoping to stumble across it but i never have.....

Subject: {pb-cle} Next Sunday~2/20~10 Hours, 10 Djs

SUNDAY::FEBRUARY 20::CLEVELAND
A FREE showcase of Cleveland area dj talent:

10 hours, 10 djs. #16
This time we are celebrating our Dead Presidents!

Another month when some of you have monday off, and another lineup of many 
new faces!!

JOESEPH
4:30-5:30
Joeseph gets stuck with opening duties yet again, and with his downtempo, 
dub & reggae stylings it will be the perfect opener. Stop back and see him 
for Snap Back Sundays on the 6th for a more upbeat set.

DAN POLITO
5:30-6:30
I had the chance to catch Dan at an open tables night at b-sides about a 
year ago. His house sound was definately impressive and I'll be looking 
forward to hearing what he brings to the tables this time.

NICK DA BRITT
6:30-7:30
%100 Brit! Nick can often be seen out supporting a variety of events. His 
progressive sounds will be much welcomed at 10-10.

VINNE
7:30-8:30
Vinnie is known for both breaks and house. I heard him playing a TIGHT house 
set at Cloud 9 not too long ago. Don't know what he'll bring to the tables 
at 10-10, but we'll be looking forward to it!

DARRELL SOUND
8:30-9:30
Darrell played our Labor Day URA party last year and definately had everyone 
excited to hear a new house dj in the area:) Definately quality tech and 
deep house!

XAVIER
9:30-10:30
Steve needs no introduction! Known nationally for his energetic house shows, 
Steve has branched out into breaks and recently into some chunky & funky 
house. Definately a pleasure to have him aboard!

AGENT
10:30-11:30
What will Agent play? Always a good question as he is known to play it all. 
>From dnb to breaks to house, Agent played an emergency slot at December's 
10-10 and got quite a postive response!

JEA LEIGH
11:30-12:30
The leading lady of the local drum & bass scene. Liquid funk has been 
incorporated into a lot of 10-10's lately, and this time we are going to try 
it early. A party and awesome tunes always follows Jess, so expect a good 
time!

SCOTT DOLAND
12:30-1:30
Scott is the resident at Tramp & the 80's night accross from the store. He's 
one of the most working djs in town, and he plans on bringing us some 
energetic trance & house sounds.

ERIC BUBBLES
1:30-2:30
If you are oldschool, Bubbles is no stranger. We haven't seen him behind the 
decks in AGES so this will definately be a highlight. Stout says he is 
looking forward to saying "See, this is Stout -- this is Bubbles. We are two 
totally different people ".

Don't forget this is absolutely FREE!

There is a "Make your own Bloody Mary Bar" in effect from 1pm on til about 
6pm. This is great hair of the dog, and a good way to start the afternoon.

It's EXTREMELY hard to find, I have heard it though.

You can actually download a huge collection of the "numbers" tracks @ 
archive.org...

http://www.archive.org/audio/audio-details-db.php?collection=irdial&collectionid=ird059

More information about the recordings can be found here:

http://www.simonmason.karoo.net/aquarius.htm


There's a lot of conspiracy involving these pirate broadcasts, my guess 
is anymore that it's something like crop circles, as it's kind of a 
not-very-secret way to broadcast messages (even with a one time pad, 
modern equipment could figure it out easily). It's very interesting and 
creepy listening none-the-less.

Master of useless information and the obscure,

Mike

How do you break a sufficiently long one-time pad?

You don't. You can't do analysis on the message, and it is pretty damn 
secure. However, there has been some research done on it, and it seems 
as though a lot of these are encyphered with 8 bits or less. With 256 
options, its not entirely impossible to brute force, although the 
message inside is again probably ciphered.

They are dumb for not doing it.  The amount of money that is injected into 
the local economy has to be over 5 million for the weekend.  I would spend 
about 600 myself in the city over the 3 days.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} local releases?

back in like '95 Chris Pulse put out a record on his own label, named
Light + One.  Its was his house stuff on side 1, and on side 2 was 2
tracks by Shawn Bateman under an alias, and one track by me, under the
alias DJ SPACED, called HALE-BOP.  Shawn was actually in the band Skin
Tree, and just had a couple tracks that were from a side project.  Not
sure if any copies are still around.  I gave out a bunch and I think I
have a couple test pressings of it somewhere.  We only ran like 500 +
test presses.

Not sure if someone mentioned it previously but I know Titonton and
the Elemental Crew out of Columbus put out some really good jungle and
stuff back in the day.  I'd love to get my hands on some of that. 
There was pressed in grey marbled wax, that was really good - had a
lock groove on it.  I think I gave what I had of dnb at the time to
Tik-Tak after he got a bunch of his records stolen way back then.

Oh yeah, don't forget HESOHI!  He put out some stuff out of Akron. 
He's still producing some good stuff from last I heard.  I think he is
with the dubtribe label, I'm not sure though.

-Ridley aka DJ SPACED

Two more...I think that Mike Filly did a remix of Dee-Lite that was 
probably pressed to vinyl...

Theo Parrish lived in Cleveland for a few months and released vinyl 
that listed a Cleveland address on the contact info.

since ferox is infinitely cooler than anything else he could have

doesnt count, he was already massively famous before he lived
there and it was quite temporary.

Of all those listed thus far, who is still in Cleveland and still 
contributing to the scene? Deviant and Jugoe are for sure; Sleepy 
C is still in the area, but last I heard he was not working at 
Mannequin Odd studios any more, and when he was, was producing and 
remixing exclusively hip hop. Maybe Doug knows more because if I 
remember correctly he's had him out for a 10-10 (?)

The whites for GPK's first release will be here in a week.  I know
Zanopticon (sp?) has some vinyl out there.  I'm sure there is more yet
and def more to come.

"tom cox"? who would ever make up such a ridiculous title.  Sadly, 
don't think it was pressed to vinyl, maybe there's some old 
wheel-to-wheel versions of it?

i actually have an old 1950's single track small dictaphoneesque
device that runs off of shitty reeled tape that i have backups of.
ive been trying to figure out how to misuse it properly. you guys
and your addiction to modern technology is actually funny.

Subject: {pb-cle} Midi files

So I got a blackberry and it will play simple midi files as long as
they are monophonic, i'm curious if anyone knows of any siteZ that
have some quick 30-45 second midi files of music where they are only
monophonic (one note at a time, people!)... or know of any software
that i can use (freeware, thiefware) to take midi files of music that
i can find, and downmix them (edit piano rolls and the such) to create
my own monophonic midis?  even just basic drum loops that are
monophonic would work... anything is better than the built in midi
files that it has...

Lou McMullen (Circuitry/Shortarm) from Canton was working with Forced Exposure, but last I heard he was living in NYC.
 
Pollen in Cleveland released some drum'n bass records.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} local releases?

with old tape decks the fun is in getting them to do crazy overdubs...its
got something to do with disabling a mechinanism that controls the posistion
playback and erase head...or totally remove the erase head

best bet if u really wanna do something with that is to get on the reel to
reel group on yahoo...they'll sort you out.

eh, sound on sound is what the multivox mx-312 tape delay im
getting in the mail is for:

http://www.harmony-central.com/Effects/Data/Multivox/MX_312_Multi_Echo-01.html

id like to think that some kind of micing of a crappy amp with the
dictaphone's mic would make for some ultracrappy
processing/compression if im trying to really dirty something up....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} fun samples

Yes I listen to BoC about 2x a week (always seem to play something by them 
on my commute).  I am more interested in sampling consonant and vowel sounds 
of the numbers and not the full ones, twos, threes, fours and so on.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} local releases?

tape echoes are cool...and if u see one for a good price definately grab
it...but anything more than 300bux is kinda crazy...most of the tape echoes
are at best what? 25 years old? mechanical shit has a tendency to break
down...tapes for them are getting harder to find....plus u dont know if the
person that used it before u beat on, never cleaned it, smoked around it, or
any other bunch of horrid scenario's ive seen gear go thru...i say buyer
beware on tape echos, especially if u see one on ebay for a price thats too
good to be true.

all that said, if i could get a nice working tape echo, i sure would!

the echo i bought (which should come in today!) doesnt take tape
cartidges, just a handmade loop which is much easier to come by
than some of hte cartridge based ones. plus, trust me mechanical
shit is much easier to deal with than some of the rare ICs
populating vintage synths that im into (my juno 106 recently
kicked a vcf/vca chip on one of its voices. the general price for
a new one is around $100. there are 6 of them in a synth that goes
for about $400. argh.) and as such is not nearly as annoying.
certainly there's a gamble with any vintage gear but the sounds
are usually well worth it.

<<<tape echoes are cool...>>>

There is a company, not sure what the mfg name is, google will fix it
but they make a current version of a 1/4"  tape echo which is smaller than
the 80's Roland Space Echo (like 2 rack spaces) which looks nice.
I saw it in a Keyboard mag or Future Music about 2-3 years ago.
So there are alternatives.  My 1/4 loop on my Space Echo
hasn't been changed in 10 years im guessing.  Im lazy.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} fun samples

Conet sampling, maybe, but I doubt it. Shortwave randomness, I don't 
think so. Check em411.com during the end of the month sometime for a 
project we like to call "the mixit". User contributed samples are the 
only thing allowed in the making of your track, and the bizarre 
differences of songs using the same 3-4 samples is amazing.

If you want to clone what someone else did with them, it was "so over" 
the minute they put out their material, but what one may do with these 
particular samples can be really amazing. Conceptually, one could do a 
real work of art with the offshoots of the idea itself.

Then again, I can't stand anything sampled and played back simply.

i cant even imagine how crusty sounding that is by now. your heads
definitely need degaussing and cleaning, and probably everything
that contacts the tape is crusty as well.

The mechanical part in a Roland Space Echo or a Korg Stage Echo is a 
motor.  One close to irreplaceable part is the rubber shoe that 
pinches against the capstan to pull the tape across the heads.

Surf to http://www.fuzzorama.com/ for a repair shop (I've never used them).

Play it Again Sam (http://www.playitagainsam.com) in Cleveland will 
repair most any reel to reel (or cassette deck) - and if you ask the 
tech nicely he will probably modify your tape echo for a reasonable 
price.  He's worked on both of mine and added a switch to the space 
echo that defeats the erase head for sound-on-sound.

Sorry, Spectrasonics - Stylus is a drum mod VST that includes a MASSIVE
amount of MIDI data.  IT IS INCREDIBLE.  You can use the midi to trigger VSTs,
external gear, what ever you choose.  Its a band in a box.
And if you fiddle with the midi enough.  The average person wouldn't know 
where it was from.
(the sounds CAN sound canned at times).  It is a HUGE time saver when it 
comes to production/workflow.  The bongos are sweet.  Use the Reaktor Space Reverb 
on them, 
I dare you.
It is available through warez and all cracks/keygens are available also.
I have all if you have trouble finding them.  Looking to trade.
The Bass mod Trilogy is also faking incredible.  And the Atmosphere?  DOPE.
Worth lookin into for any style.

One draw back to the midi data is that it is set up like rex midi data 
(Reason > to track)
it is in that escalating key style.  There is a trick to getting the data to 
work for you.
Here it is quick like - Lets say , find your kick drum, midi hits only, mute 
everything else out with the mute tool (Cubase here).  Select each hit 
individually and arrow each hit down to
a common key, say C1.  There you have it.  The kick track on one key C1.
Finish by doing all the drum parts to common keys and use as fit.  
Seems tedious at first but this process is a production power house 
when you get use to it.

yeah its not reccomended to clean that rubber bit with anything
with alcohol in it since that will dry out the rubber. afaik,
everything else is fixable.

hehe, thats why i hooked up that multivox joint, its got sound on
sound, 4 playback heads, built in spring reverb, and its much
cheaper than a roland....

Surprised no one's mentioned pulsars yet.  I just think what a pulsar  
is cool, the sounds they make aren't really all discernable though.   
tons of links in google, here's some of the of good sites:

http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~pulsar/Education/Sounds/sounds.html
http://www.astrosurf.org/lombry/audiofiles-pulsar.htm

Think the vela pulsar sounds the coolest.

i read the manual for the cv/gate triggers(not all cv/gate triggers are the

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} local releases?

it all depends how much tape is in the loop i guess...if u have like a foot
of tape, you're gonna have to change it much more often than if u have a
100foot spool in there

regardless, a tape head should be cleaned and de-gaused every 8-10 hours of
use(thats why dat machines and high end reel to reel machines, and even some
high end cassette decks have hour counters on them)....if u are gonna clean
and degause the head, u might as well change the tape while its open...as
the tape passes the head, more and more crud is building on the head, and
there is less and less magnetic material on the tape itself.

its mostly those weirdo korgs that use the other scaling,
hz/octave i think it is. my korg mono/poly is i think the only one
that runs off of the normal v/octave. other than that roland uses
a different trigger polarity than the other standard (i believe it
was moog who did the other one?) but you wouldnt have any
possiblitiy of messing that up by triggering the 101 with one of
your roland boxes.

the 101 is so limited in what it can do i cant imagine what you
would need a patch book for. there's not much going on in the way
of weird modulation, you should be able to visualise what a patch
on there looks like. :P

at really high resonancies it helps to keep the cutoff way low if
you want anything resembling music to come out. you can still get
some nice 303 style sounds out of it.

i cant help but feel like the 777 costs more and is less
interesting sounding than any number of old synths like the pro-1,
oddyssey, mono/poly (my vote for the best sub $500 synth you can
buy), etc. all of those synths are pretty complex and very
interesting and distinctive sounding and you can even maybe find
two for the $800 or so that a 777 costs like i did, i got a white
oddy and a mono/poly for like $825 altogether.

Dood I picked up a Pro1 AND a SH 101 at the Musicians swap shop on Detroit in 
Lakewood for 150$! a piece (as well as the Space Echco 150!$)
Yes this was 10 years ago.  But it was all like in a weeks period of time.
Someone unloaded alot of gear that week....

Anyway...  But the 777 has midi on it no>?  That would be the big advantage 
for me.
I do hate fiddling with xtra cords with the Kenton cv.gate boxes.
Midi is such a luxury when it comes to that stuff.  Sound wise though
your right, those old chips got something to them.

yeah man, 10 years ago that might have been possible. not these
days. i wonder if they had belonged to anyone famous? a friend of
mine has john aquaviva's pro one that i bet was used on some of
those early plus 8 records by richie hawtin and dan bell.

i think it does have midi. but really, a midi-cv converter is a
good thing to have. ive got the frostwave quad midi-cv and its the
bomb, i never have to even think about it unless i want to change
the pitch bend range (you can choose either 1 step or one octave).

Subject: {pb-cle} Italian DJ Fined 1.4 Mln Euros for Music Piracy

 ROME (Reuters) - An Italian DJ has been fined a record 1.4 million euros 
($1.8 million) for using thousands of pirate music files in a nightclub near 
Rome, police said on Wednesday.
Police in the town of Rieti, near Rome, said they raided a popular nightclub 
earlier this week as part of a crackdown on piracy and seized 500 illegally 
copied music videos and more than 2,000 MP3 music files.
Police said the files belonged to a "well-known" Italian DJ. "For the MP3 
files, which were kept on the DJ's personal computer, the DJ has received a 
fine of 1.4 million euros," Rieti finance police said in a statement.
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) said the 
fine was the biggest ever slapped on an individual for unlawful music 
copying and the use of copyrighted music in the MP3 format.
More than 7,000 legal actions have been launched against alleged uploaders 
in the United States, Canada and countries in Europe as the music industry 
fights to stop piracy which it blames for a decline over a number of years 
in CD sales.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} fun samples

the sh-101 only responds to stuff on the 4th octave and above...but other
than that it works fine...the 777 is an awesome synth and sequencer...not
only does it have full midi, it also does cv/gate...it can tottally act like
a 303 if u want...but thats just the tip of the iceberg...the filters can be
driven to self oscilation...it can do hooverish sounds...obviously being
that its a mono synth its not gonna be doing big textured pads, but i dont
think thats what its designed for(and the alpha juno2 and the orbit do that
stuff way better anyways)...my only complaint is the lack of an adsr on the
amp section...but other than that its definately worth having

my understanding is the revolution is just the sequencer of the 777....its
worth it if u need not only a hardware midi sequencer but also a cv/gate
sequencer...but if u just need midi, u can get away with a korg electribe
ea-1 for sequencing keys.

good luck finding a vintage synth that is mint condition tho...thats why
alot of ppl copped up on those 777's...they arent 25 years old and in need
of work.

Thats a nice midi cv converter for sure.  The conversion rate kills it at 
over $700usd right now.  Let me know if you plan on selling it any time 
soon.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

SUNDAY::FEBRUARY 20::CLEVELAND
A FREE showcase of Cleveland area dj talent:

10 hours, 10 djs. #16
This time we are celebrating our Dead Presidents!

Another month when some of you have monday off, and another lineup of 
many new faces!!

JOESEPH
4:30-5:30
Joeseph gets stuck with opening duties yet again, and with his 
downtempo, dub & reggae stylings it will be the perfect opener. Stop 
back and see him for Snap Back Sundays on the 6th for a more upbeat set.

DAN POLITO
5:30-6:30
I had the chance to catch Dan at an open tables night at b-sides about a 
year ago. His house sound was definately impressive and I'll be looking 
forward to hearing what he brings to the tables this time.

NICK DA BRITT
6:30-7:30
%100 Brit! Nick can often be seen out supporting a variety of events. 
His progressive sounds will be much welcomed at 10-10.

VINNE
7:30-8:30
Vinnie is known for both breaks and house. I heard him playing a TIGHT 
house set at Cloud 9 not too long ago. Don't know what he'll bring to 
the tables at 10-10, but we'll be looking forward to it!

DARRELL SOUND
8:30-9:30
Darrell played our Labor Day URA party last year and definately had 
everyone excited to hear a new house dj in the area:) Definately quality 
tech and deep house!

XAVIER
9:30-10:30
Steve needs no introduction! Known nationally for his energetic house 
shows, Steve has branched out into breaks and recently into some chunky 
& funky house. Definately a pleasure to have him aboard!

AGENT
10:30-11:30
What will Agent play? Always a good question as he is known to play it 
all. From dnb to breaks to house, Agent played an emergency slot at 
December's 10-10 and got quite a postive response!

JEA LEIGH
11:30-12:30
The leading lady of the local drum & bass scene. Liquid funk has been 
incorporated into a lot of 10-10's lately, and this time we are going to 
try it early. A party and awesome tunes always follows Jess, so expect a 
good time!

SCOTT DOLAND
12:30-1:30
Scott is the resident at Tramp & the 80's night accross from the store. 
He's one of the most working djs in town, and he plans on bringing us 
some energetic trance & house sounds.

ERIC BUBBLES
1:30-2:30
If you are oldschool, Bubbles is no stranger. We haven't seen him behind 
the decks in AGES so this will definately be a highlight. Stout says he 
is looking forward to saying "See, this is Stout -- this is Bubbles. We 
are two totally different people ".

Don't forget this is absolutely FREE!

There is a "Make your own Bloody Mary Bar" in effect from 1pm on til 
about 6pm. This is great hair of the dog, and a good way to start the

Thu Feb 24                       DJ SKRIBBLE                      Cleveland

Wish Nightclub is pleased to announce, coming back to Cleveland, DJ 
Skribble...on Thursday, February 24rd, 2004...

Selecting a house and hip hop set...

On "ESSENTIAL DANCE 2000," Atlantic's first joint release with the 
Warner Essential label, the one-and-only DJ Skribble spins pop, house, 
electronica, hip hop and progressive trance into a boombastic 
multi-artist mix which makes it perfectly clear why MTVs own superstar 
DJ is tops both in his field and on the dance floor. Capturing all the 
vibe and vitality of a live Skribble club set, " "ESSENTIAL DANCE 2000" 
"sees this master dj blending hit tracks - from an eclectic array of 
musicians such as Moby, Cher, Filter, William Orbit, the Vengaboys, 
Fragma, and even Bob Marley - with his own idiosyncratic brand of 
anything-goes mixing. "A DJ should be able to go into any kind of party 
and adapt to any kind of situation," Skribble says. "If youre not 
versatile, you just trap yourself into a corner. I pride myself on 
trying to play many different styles of music. I can go to a hardcore 
hip hop club, play for those kids, then go to a hardcore rave and play 
the hardest trance set. What makes a great DJ is the ability to play for 
anybody."

rizumu
SATURDAY FEBRUARY 26TH 2005 > > > PHILADELPHIA
shawn rudiman + lukas owens + adam ratana + jwan allen + matt knyc
[ technoirAudio : pittsburgh ] 3 hr live performance

On this February night, for three straight hours, five electronic
musicians combine their talents to bring you a massive live
performance. Their palette will be an excessive amount of studio
hardware, a PC, and a crate of vinyl. With Shawn, Lukas, and Matt at
the helm of the insanity, Jwan and Adam will complement their live
work through the dj mixer, manipulating and adding elements to the
mix.

Maintaining strong links to Detroit techno, Shawn Rudiman's 2004
performance at "Green Lights Go"-a highlight moment at Detroit's
annual Movement Festival-saw him simultaneously working his live set
along with legendary artists Claude Young and Anthony "Shake" Shakir.
Expect a similar experience this month at rizumu, courtesy of Funkshun
and the Technoir collective.

Technoiraudio is committed and dedicated to releasing only quality
material with strong ideas, direction, personality, and
feeling-striving for definition that cannot simply be packaged into
neatly labeled bins. Complimentary copies of Shawn Rudiman's
Synthesexual LP will be given out in celebration of the new release.

CAMILO PARDO

Camilo Pardo has drawn and re-drawn the Ford GT in his mind for more 
than a decade. Those years of mental sketching will pay off for the 
Ford GT chief designer this year, when hell be able to see his modern 
reissue of the 1960s-era racing legend hit the streets.As an 
accomplished designer, artist, sculptor, clothing and furniture 
designer, Camilos work has been featured on roadways  as well as in 
galleries and shows  worldwide. From autobahns in Germany and cafs in 
Italy to the walls of the Detroit Institute of Arts, to the stages of 
the Paris Motor Show, his art reflects his love for innovation and 
design. Being an artist really complements my car designs. I can't 
imagine having one without the other, Camilo says. Both require me 
to deal with proportions, emotions and creativity, which all lead to 
perfect execution.Camilo is a native New Yorker who says he knew at a 
young age that both art and automotive design would drive his career 
path.
To follow the dream, he enrolled at the Center for Creative Studies in 
Detroit, where he graduated and was granted the Industrial Design 
Society of America Merit Award in 1985. Immediately following his 
graduation, he joined Fords design staff in Dearborn, keeping an easy 
commute to his downtown Detroit art studio and apartment, where he still 
lives and works on his other artistic endeavors in his spare time.

artist creating his unique style of body painting at our event.

LOCKDOWN


KLUTE
(drum and bass)
London, UK // Metalheadz, Commercial Suicide, BBS

If the term pioneer held any meaning in the world of Drum and Bass, 
you'd find DJ Klute's picture listed somewhere by it in the 
dictionary. With releases on such paramount labels as Hospital and 
Headz, and with DJ gigs from New York to New Zealand, saying Klute is 
merely a staple would be an understatement. For years, his tracks 
have been in constant heavy rotation in nearly every Jungle DJs crate. 
His label, Commercial Suicide, has boasted releases from the likes of 
D.Kay, Calibre, Digital, and Total Science. Now with the highly 
acclaimed release of his 4th LP last December, his latest mix CD for the 
Metalheadz Americas, and having just been featured on the cover of the 
infamous Knowledge Magazine, it's safe to say the reign of Klute has 
begun!

Sat Mar 12                    THE MISSING PEACE                     Toronto

"If we are incapable of finding peace in ourselves, it is pointless to 
search elsewhere."
------------- Francois de la Rochefoucauld

For too many years we have branded ourselves by genres, crews and 
cliques. We abandoned togetherness, and closed our minds to the 
limitless possibilities of music. We became so focused on our scene of 
choice that we have forgotten what captured our imagination that very 
first night. We have forgotten our commonality through music. We have 
forgotten the connective link. Together on March 12th 2005, we will 
place:

    Area 1 - The Conundrum

    No Left Turn
    (San Francisco, USA) (KFA, K12, Liquid Vinyl)
    This man is perhaps the most talented happy hardcore DJ in North 
America. His genre-hopping, aggressive, high BPM mixes on up to six 
turntables inspire awe in all those who have seen or heard him play. On 
this night he will be playing a two hour extended set that will take you 
on a journey that none shall soon forget.

    Dynamic vs. enD vs. Everybodies Daddy vs. Gobstoppa - Extended Set
    (Nocturnal Comissions/GXF)(Pitched Up Recordings, Goodfellaz)(FPS, 
    Hullabaloo)(Everywhere, Toronto)
    Four of Toronto's most talented performers converge on one stage for 
an hour and a half of absolute mayhem. All of them are skilled as DJs 
and as MCs, and all will showcase both abilities in an all out back to 
back to back to back battle of gabber, jungle, and happy hardcore.

    DJ Wolf vs. DJ Tranzit - Extended Set
    (Future Perfect Synergy, icantstopraving.com)
    Future Perfect Synergy co-founders, both of them crowd favourites 
every time they play. The Toronto scratchmaster pits classics, upfront 
bangers and newschool anthems against Tranzits classic anthems, 
pitched up euro, and who knows what else for one and a half hours of 
crowd-pleasing business.

    Dr. Fritz
    (Sourkee, BetterThan, ONdaFLY, Spacemonkey, Soundbwoy)
    As a DJ, Dr. Fritz is one of Toronto's best kept secrets. He is a 
veteran DJ and producer, whos coming out of the studio just for you. 
His style of Jungle can only be described as mashed up ragga jump-up, 
thats as intricately mixed as it is varied.

    D-Minus
    (Hullabaloo! ATM, E-Mail, Nightmare, Rave N Beats Canada)
    Always a crowd favourite wherever he plays, D-Minus has been shaking 
down dance floors across North America since 1997. Hes guaranteed to 
mash up the the venue with the quick cutting and track selection. 
Garaunteed anthems; Garaunteed sing-a-long; You know the score.

    Mizz Lee
    (The Business, Kooterkore)
    Mizlee is another quickly rising star in our scene. Starting as a 
happy hardcore DJ, evolving to breakbeat hardcore, and now regarded as 
one of Londons finest jungle selectors, her set promises to reflect 
her musical history, and eclectic personality.

    No Frills
    (statis.org, Iceberg)
    Making his return to Toronto's hardcore scene after far too long an 
absence, No Frills is bringing his years of experience, insane 
scratching skills, and records spanning ten years of Happy Hardcore 
history for you.

    s-capade
    (hardcoretechno.ca)
    For far too long a virtual unknown in Toronto, s-capade continues to 
toil relentlessly on the decks, churning out the finest hardcore techno 
mixes in the city. Do not miss his set, because it will be unlike 
anything you've heard in Toronto before.

    MC Everybodies Daddy
    (Future Perfect Synergy, Hullabaloo!, icantstopraving.com, ONdaFLY)
    The third piece of the Future Perfect Synergy puzzle, MCED brings 
his commanding stage presence, quick freestyle rhymes, and boundless 
energy to play for you.

    MC Gobstoppa
    (Hullabaloo, Goodfellaz, M'asstadon, Totally Sweet Radio)
    Arguably the number one Happy Hardcore MC in North America, this man 
is a fixture at every hardcore event in Toronto, and for good reason. 
His contagious energy and endless supply of rhymes turn every party he 
plays in to a madhouse.

    MC enD
    (Goodfellaz, GXF, Pitched Up Recordings)
    One of the finest freestyle MCs you will ever have a chance to 
experience. He flows smoothly over everything from drum n' bass to 
gabber with his own distinct sound, and razor sharp wit.

    Dynamic MC
    (Nocturnal Comissions, GXF)
    Quickly rising through the ranks of MCs in Toronto, Dynamic 
possesses a love for happy hardcore that rivals his love of 
Jagermeister. Any combination of the two, and he's guaranteed to take 
you on an adventure you wont soon remember!

    Area 2 - The Enigma
    Hosted by Dr. Fritz

    DJ Antik (Ottawa)
    (Ministry of Sound DJs, Eclipse Productions, 88.5 KOC FM)
    DJ Antik is one of the best house DJs you will experience, period. 
Rock solid, creative mixing, mastery of effects, and scratching are 
second nature to this man. Hes bringing bags and bags of funky, 
driving house, breaks and techno, and were giving him two solid hours 
to shake you to your very soul.

    T & A - JustinTyce & Adam Addison
    (www.ONdaFLY.net, Houseing Project, www.beatfreakers.com, Future 
Perfect Synergy)
    FPS residents JustinTyce & Adam Addison are favourites of the 
Toronto scene for good reason. Every time they play, the dancefloor 
becomes packed, the vibe rises to a whole new level, and the sweat 
starts to drip. Two hours will hardly seem like enough time for this duo 
to rock your world.

    DJ XTC
    (Quantum, Citrus, Delirium)
    He's been workin' out, eatin' his wheaties and drinkin' his milk. 
After years in a senior citizens home, the old man is breaking free. For 
this night only, he's bringing back the hardstyle. A staple in the 
Toronto underground throughout the 90's, XTC tore up the masses with 
turntablism, aggressive mixing and unmatched creativity. With the help 
of a few Geritol, he claims this set will not be surpassed for years.

    PlasticMotive
    (Sourkee, Goodfellaz, Funkadelic, ONdaFLY, BetterThan)
    Another veteran of the Toronto breaks scene, PlasticMotive plays 
hard funky breaks to drive the dancefloor insane. When the man behind 
Sourkee and ReForm checks in, there's no way that the crowd can sit 
down.

    DJ Opel
    (Nightmare, Terror Inc. 2theBeat.com, Embedded)
    Rapidly becoming a crowd favourite for his eclectic and 
unpredictable style, and ability to rock venues in any one of a number 
of genres. Opel will be bringing the dark, hard UK techno on this one, 
so come prepared to rock the fuck out!

    Elixir
    (discotoast.com, Hullabaloo!)
    A Toronto favourite for many years, Elixir promises to take you on 
an epic journey through trance, pushing you to your limits of endurance, 
and the peaks of ecstasy. Close your eyes, and let Elixir sweep you off 
your feet.

    HardFlow
    (ICantStopRaving.com, Eternal NRG, Funkadelic Industries, 3XP)
    This up and comer in the Toronto trance scene is gaining quite a 
following, and for good reason. His hard trance sound consistently moves 
dancefloors, no matter what time of night he plays.

    * The Missing Piece *
    Were providing a unique opportunity for unheard of talent to break 
out of the bedroom, and in to the rave. The first two bedroom DJs of 
any style, any genre, through the doors at this event will be given 30 
minutes on the decks, with the possibility of a booking at an upcoming 
FPS event. Will you be the Missing Piece?



    We will be stuffing our venue chock full of all the best things to 
make your night unforgettable. Custom sound, intelligent lighting, mutli 
colour lasers in both rooms, crazy decor, vendors, 19+ area with ID, 
giveaways all night... plus a few crazy extras to be announced closer to 
the night of.

    Tickets are available online now at www.ticketweb.com, and we'll be 
stocking both Numb and 2 The Beat very shortly. You can also buy your 
advance tickets off of DJ Tranzit, DJ Wolf, or Errrrrrrbodies Diddy in

I envision it not being padded, rather, it will be velcro, that way
you can toss forte up and he'll stick to the ceiling, all that
romanian goodness.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} dj fresh new mix-cd & tour BASS INVADERZ





Fresh is one of the great high energy drum 'n' bass producer / dj's of Bad
Company UK, aka )EIB( .  :)

The remix of Tiesto's Flight 643 that was on Dieselboy's "The
Dungeonmaster's Guide" was by Paul B + Subwave of Russia - I LOVE this
track!  It was one of my favorite tracks of 2004.  So beautiful, so
emotive.

Fresh is Dan Fresh.  Met him twice when he came through Baltimore, and once
at Platinum in Philly.  Very upbeat, friendly guy.  If you see him in
Dayton, say hello.  :)

This is an ingenius mix, imho, because it's a concept mix-CD, and if you
have a sense of humor, it's great fun.  :)

respectfully,
mary :)

HEADLINE: The Turn Away From the Turntable

BYLINE: By SIMON REYNOLDS

BODY:


IN the first months of 2005, two of electronic dance music's biggest
bands will release what are generally referred to as long-awaited
albums. But what's uncertain is how many people are actually waiting
to greet the Chemical Brothers' ''Push the Button,'' out this week, or
Daft Punk's ''Human After All,'' due in March. If the humiliatingly
lukewarm response to last fall's comeback albums by the top dance acts
the Prodigy and Fatboy Slim is any measure, neither Daft Punk nor the
Chemical Brothers ought to bank on teeming throngs at the record
stores or a warm radio welcome.

During the halcyon days of the late 90's, these groups were the Big
Four of crossover electronica, their music fusing techno's pounding
machine rhythms with anthemic hooks and hard riffs that worked as well
on rock radio as they did on the dance floor. The Prodigy's success
eclipsed everybody else's (''The Fat of the Land'' sold nearly three
million copies in America alone), but Daft Punk and Chemical Brothers
enjoyed MTV hits (''Da Funk'' and ''Setting Sun,'' respectively),
while tracks by Fatboy Slim achieved ubiquity via movie soundtracks
and TV commercials.

In those days, electronica was so trendy that Madonna jumped on two
different techno bandwagons in swift succession, assimilating the
euphoric riffs of trance with ''Ray of Light'' and aping the spangly
effervescence of French house on ''Music.'' The bullish mood in the
electronic community back then was typified by Paul Oakenfold, the
British superstar D.J., who tried to break his moistly emotional brand
of trance in America, in the belief that this country was set to be
dance music's next big commercial frontier.

Quite the opposite happened. In the new millennium, the mainstream
profile of dance music dipped alarmingly. This downturn occurred on
both sides of the Atlantic, but it was particularly precipitous in
America, where electronica was edged off of the charts by the twin
juggernauts of nu-metal and pop-punk, along with the perennial might
of hip-hop. But it wasn't just a case of mass-media gatekeepers
abandoning electronic music. Something was ailing at the grass roots
of the scene. Formerly packed superclubs began to close, or move to
smaller venues. Large raves, once the mainstay of dance culture,
became nearly extinct. ''Rave is dead in the Los Angeles area,'' says
the West Coast scene watcher Dennis Romero, who is news editor at the
dance magazine BPM.

As recently as 2001, Southern California was still the most vibrant
rave scene in America, but according to Mr. Romero, the kids just
aren't coming out to big events anymore, partly because of Ecstasy
burnout. ''The superclubs here are starting to see diminishing numbers
as well,'' Mr. Romero says, ''with popular nights like Spundae taking
a hiatus and Red closing down altogether.''

Not only were sales of crossover-oriented electronica plummeting; the
underground dance music sold in specialist record stores also
declined. Some of those shops have closed because business is slow and
record labels are suffering. ''People I know who run labels keep
getting worse and worse news,'' says William Linn, a San
Francisco-based dance party promoter. ''Partly it's because of the
Internet, people just taking the music for free. But it's also because
people aren't buying the stuff in the way they were when the music was
a really new thing back in the early 90's.'' During that rave culture
heyday, an underground anthem could sell anywhere from 10,000 to
50,000 copies. Today, shifting a thousand copies of a 12-inch single
is considered a good result.

What happened? One cause is the continued fragmentation of dance
culture into myriad micro-genres with narrow aesthetic parameters and
niche followings. Another factor is musical overproduction, which
effectively divides the pie into smaller slices. But the overall pie
also seems to be shrinking as well. Dance music has simply lost the
ear of the floating consumer. This may be, in part, a matter of
fashion: electronic dance music had been around long enough to lose
its ''new kid on the subcultural block'' status. The music had become
familiar, and familiarity bred ennui.

Other genres have certainly suffered this kind of problem; dance music
is going through the kind of midlife crisis that afflicts any genre
that's been around a while (think rock music in the 1980's). ''We're
just waiting for the next Big New Thing in dance music to come
along,'' says Norman Cook, the man behind Fatboy Slim. ''Right now
we're between New Things, and no one quite knows what the next one
will be.''

The central idea of electronic music's unwritten manifesto was always
to surge full-tilt into the future. But in recent years many creators
of dance music have been investigating the genre's own history,
reworking ideas from electro, synthpop and Italodisco. Even more
oddly, others have been looking to rock music for reinvigoration. Mr.
Cook's ''Palookaville'' used rock instrumentation (guitar and bass)
and more conventional verse/chorus song structures. Last year's
biggest dancefloor anthem was Alter Ego's ''Rocker,'' whose simple,
chugging rhythm and squealing riffs are transparently modeled on heavy
metal. Swaths of Daft Punk's new album, ''Human After All,'' resemble
an electronicized version of hard rock. Two highly touted early 2005
albums, the self-titled debut from LCD Soundsystem and Mu's ''Out of
Breach,'' have a rough-hewn, ''live'' garage punk feel to much of
their contents.

Other currently hot outfits like Black Strobe, Tiefschwarz and Kiki
hark back to 80's alternative rock genres like Goth and industrial.
Kiki's ''End of the World,'' for instance, features the Finnish-born
producer paying vocal homage to the doomy, hollow-drone baritone of
Andrew Eldritch of the goth-rock gods Sisters of Mercy. Perhaps the
most bizarre example of dance music ransacking rock's archives was
last year's fad for schaffel (German for shuffle), which involved
producers renovating the stomping rhythms of 70's glam rock artists
like T. Rex and Gary Glitter. It's hard to say whether all these
different forms of rockified techno represent a subconscious attempt
by the scene to ingratiate its way back into the mainstream, or are
simply a case of producers looking for genre-crossing thrills. But
none of them exactly restake dance music's claim as the music of the
future.

Alongside its commitment to constant innovation, another central tenet
of dance culture was the idea of being underground, an outlaw scene.
In the early days, dance culture was oriented around one-off raves in
unusual locations, often involving organizers breaking into warehouses
or invading outdoor spaces. Proper safety codes were rarely observed,
drugs were rife and the behavior of the participants verged on
anarchy. Gradually, the thrills and dangers of raves were replaced by
the more reliable pleasures offered by superclubs -- organized by
professionals and regularly scheduled but still fairly wild in terms
of drug-fueled hedonism.

Today, the action is mostly in small clubs -- like APT (419 West 13th
Street) and Ikon (610 West 56th Street) in Manhattan -- in some cases
barely more than glorified bars. There, the audience exudes a
clean-cut, metrosexual aura. At times it feels as if the room has been
teleported to a chic bar in Barcelona or Berlin, especially as, more
often than not, the D.J. is from Europe. Germany, in particular, is
the spiritual homeland for American dance hipsters these days. Most of
the leading labels -- Kompakt, B-Pitch Control, Playhouse, Get
Physical -- are based there. In fact, some North American D.J.'s and
producers like Richie Hawtin have moved to Germany because the climate
for electronic music is more supportive.

If neither sonic futurism nor underground edginess apply any longer,
electronic dance music's remaining raison d'etre is, well, dancing.
But in recent years it may have been beaten on the shake-your-booty
front by dancehall and Southern rap. In response, some dance producers
have started to draw upon raucously vibrant ''street'' beats: crunk,
Miami bass, dancehall, grime and so forth.

The result is a growing hybrid genre, highlighted on the recent,
excellent compilation ''Shockout,'' known as ''breakcore.'' Purveyed
by artists like DJ/Rupture and Teamshadetek, the music combines
rumbling basslines, fidgety beats and grainy ragga vocals to create a
home-listening surrogate for the ''bashment'' vibe of a Jamaican sound
system party. Others within the breakcore genre, like Knifehandchop,
Kid 606 and Soundmurderer, hark back to rave's own early days, their
music evoking the rowdy fervor of a time when huge crowds flailed
their limbs to a barrage of abstract noise and convulsive rhythm. It's
a poignant aural mirage of a time when techno music was made for the
popular vanguard rather than a connoisseurial elite, as it is today.

Today's sharpest contemporary dance music operators, like Tiefschwarz
or LCD Soundsystem, are roughly equivalent to recombinant rock auteurs
of the 90's like PJ Harvey and Pavement, who generated sounds that
weren't strictly innovative but managed to somehow feel original.
Tiefschwarz's brothers-in-production duo Ali and Basti Schwarz and
LCD's James Murphy have an almost scholarly knowledge of dance music
history. They're adept at getting period sounds, but they combine them
in fresh ways.

On LCD's album and Tiefschwarz's superb remix collection ''Misch
Masch,'' we don't really encounter the shock of the new; instead we
get the frisson of novelty, subtle twists and cunning permutations
within an established form. Which will have to be enough for now,
until dance music producers once again figure out how to smack
listeners upside the head with sonic strangeness.

Well, as much as I don't like the author, I agree with him... somewhat.

Yes, record sales have plummeted, not only in dance, but in all genres, thanks
to the Internet.  I believe that will be the case for a long time.  Due to the
situation that occurred in Italy, as long as I'm a DJ, I think I will buy
records.

Yes, electronic dance had its bad moments, but dance is far from dead.  I
believe things are about to change... I've noticed here at home peeps are
getting sick or rap & are currently looking for something new besides the
mainstream.  Someone real soon is gonna drop a serious (or cheesy... e.g.
Macarena... did I spell that right?) mix that's gonna blow up. I think it's
about that time.

Just my opinion, though

Correct.  Now it's called Dance Rock and has nothing to do with electronic  
music.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} crazy braintec

If looking for a 303 clone - check out Future Retro's Revolution.  I
have one of the FR-777s - those are out of production though.  Looks
like the revolution is the new model, has digital DSP effects yet pure
analog synth.

Cool braintec link - wonder if i could learn kung-fu with it.  It
would be difficult to capture memories, I think they are stored almost
holographically in distribution and quite associative in nature.  Not
sure how they would corelate from one mind to the next without direct
interpritation.  Maybe someday.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Simon Reynold's New York Times article  

I think this article rings true on many fronts.  Considering that Simon 
Reynolds is jaded and is always looking for the new "trend" (or so it seems 
to me) then he will always be chasing something ellusive.  Perhaps I don't 
read enough of his stuff, but knowing other that do it seems "being on the 
edge" is a common denominator and until there is something big enough to be 
the cutting edge of or to be the alternative of -- then its pointless to 
even look further.

We live in a post-rave society where most people's perception of DANCE MUSIC 
is influenced by what rave was.  Speaking to most of you, many still live in 
a "rave" mindset and don't see the bigger picture.   "Electronic Music" as 
its own genre is an oxymoron, because it is all really electronic music.  As 
the memory of rave fades from society, the crumbs that are left of "techno" 
will be pretty much what is left from "industrial" in the 80's.   Sure 
"techno" will always be an influence on the retro fad of the moment (ex 
punk, 80's, disco etc) but what was is over.

Clubbing will always be there, and the problem that nightclubs currently 
face is that they are stuck in this limbo.  Top40 joints are a constant, 
those clubs will always be.  The same with more urban clubs, rock clubs, 
etc.   However traditional non-mainstram clubbing of the 70's, 80's and 90's 
got lost with raves.  As ravers got older and invaded the clubs, the artform 
was lost and clubs only became "min-raves".  "Techno" is hated in the 
mainstream because of this now.

So where does the future lie?  The way I see it, there have always been 
three sides to mainstream music.  There has been the rock side, the pop 
side, and urban side.  The pure pop side is stuff that is produced for mass 
consumption and generally disposable (in the grand scheme of things) -- NOT 
UNLIKE DANCE MUSIC.   So when pop music heads into a phase where the tempo 
picks up and it gets easier to dance -- then clubbing will change -- and 
then it will be easier to compare and say "this is innovative -- this not".

Oh, and Entropy, you've never been the sharpest tool in the shed -- 
Entropy said
"Correct.  Now it's called Dance Rock and has nothing to do with electronic
music."

In the early 90's it was DOR.

My two cents, anyhow.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} fun samples

Didn't see this thread before i mentioned the revolution in another
one.  I'd want one of those sh-101s for that random LFO - those are
not that comon on anolog gear.  I hear ya with the resonence squelch. 
I have a chroma polaris and its got a strange harsh screach to it too,
difficult to use - way sensitive.  Glad to hear someone else uses a
FR-777.  I actually don't really use the sequencer on it.  I play it
like a mono synth most of the time for dnb bass.  One hand playing
keys on my juno triggering midi and then using the other to tweak the
777, really good for baselines.  that thing sounds sick run through my
Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier amp head, talk about analog filth.

you know it is bad when it used to be like 1.55 canadian per dollar,
now it's only like 1.22.  that's piss poor, the main drop came back in
'02-'03 when it dropped about 20 cents in 12 months...

HEADLINE: The Turn Away From the Turntable

BYLINE: By SIMON REYNOLDS

BODY:


IN the first months of 2005, two of electronic dance music's biggest
bands will release what are generally referred to as long-awaited
albums. But what's uncertain is how many people are actually waiting
to greet the Chemical Brothers' ''Push the Button,'' out this week, or
Daft Punk's ''Human After All,'' due in March. If the humiliatingly
lukewarm response to last fall's comeback albums by the top dance acts
the Prodigy and Fatboy Slim is any measure, neither Daft Punk nor the
Chemical Brothers ought to bank on teeming throngs at the record
stores or a warm radio welcome.

During the halcyon days of the late 90's, these groups were the Big
Four of crossover electronica, their music fusing techno's pounding
machine rhythms with anthemic hooks and hard riffs that worked as well
on rock radio as they did on the dance floor. The Prodigy's success
eclipsed everybody else's (''The Fat of the Land'' sold nearly three
million copies in America alone), but Daft Punk and Chemical Brothers
enjoyed MTV hits (''Da Funk'' and ''Setting Sun,'' respectively),
while tracks by Fatboy Slim achieved ubiquity via movie soundtracks
and TV commercials.

In those days, electronica was so trendy that Madonna jumped on two
different techno bandwagons in swift succession, assimilating the
euphoric riffs of trance with ''Ray of Light'' and aping the spangly
effervescence of French house on ''Music.'' The bullish mood in the
electronic community back then was typified by Paul Oakenfold, the
British superstar D.J., who tried to break his moistly emotional brand
of trance in America, in the belief that this country was set to be
dance music's next big commercial frontier.

Quite the opposite happened. In the new millennium, the mainstream
profile of dance music dipped alarmingly. This downturn occurred on
both sides of the Atlantic, but it was particularly precipitous in
America, where electronica was edged off of the charts by the twin
juggernauts of nu-metal and pop-punk, along with the perennial might
of hip-hop. But it wasn't just a case of mass-media gatekeepers
abandoning electronic music. Something was ailing at the grass roots
of the scene. Formerly packed superclubs began to close, or move to
smaller venues. Large raves, once the mainstay of dance culture,
became nearly extinct. ''Rave is dead in the Los Angeles area,'' says
the West Coast scene watcher Dennis Romero, who is news editor at the
dance magazine BPM.

As recently as 2001, Southern California was still the most vibrant
rave scene in America, but according to Mr. Romero, the kids just
aren't coming out to big events anymore, partly because of Ecstasy
burnout. ''The superclubs here are starting to see diminishing numbers
as well,'' Mr. Romero says, ''with popular nights like Spundae taking
a hiatus and Red closing down altogether.''

Not only were sales of crossover-oriented electronica plummeting; the
underground dance music sold in specialist record stores also
declined. Some of those shops have closed because business is slow and
record labels are suffering. ''People I know who run labels keep
getting worse and worse news,'' says William Linn, a San
Francisco-based dance party promoter. ''Partly it's because of the
Internet, people just taking the music for free. But it's also because
people aren't buying the stuff in the way they were when the music was
a really new thing back in the early 90's.'' During that rave culture
heyday, an underground anthem could sell anywhere from 10,000 to
50,000 copies. Today, shifting a thousand copies of a 12-inch single
is considered a good result.

What happened? One cause is the continued fragmentation of dance
culture into myriad micro-genres with narrow aesthetic parameters and
niche followings. Another factor is musical overproduction, which
effectively divides the pie into smaller slices. But the overall pie
also seems to be shrinking as well. Dance music has simply lost the
ear of the floating consumer. This may be, in part, a matter of
fashion: electronic dance music had been around long enough to lose
its ''new kid on the subcultural block'' status. The music had become
familiar, and familiarity bred ennui.

Other genres have certainly suffered this kind of problem; dance music
is going through the kind of midlife crisis that afflicts any genre
that's been around a while (think rock music in the 1980's). ''We're
just waiting for the next Big New Thing in dance music to come
along,'' says Norman Cook, the man behind Fatboy Slim. ''Right now
we're between New Things, and no one quite knows what the next one
will be.''

The central idea of electronic music's unwritten manifesto was always
to surge full-tilt into the future. But in recent years many creators
of dance music have been investigating the genre's own history,
reworking ideas from electro, synthpop and Italodisco. Even more
oddly, others have been looking to rock music for reinvigoration. Mr.
Cook's ''Palookaville'' used rock instrumentation (guitar and bass)
and more conventional verse/chorus song structures. Last year's
biggest dancefloor anthem was Alter Ego's ''Rocker,'' whose simple,
chugging rhythm and squealing riffs are transparently modeled on heavy
metal. Swaths of Daft Punk's new album, ''Human After All,'' resemble
an electronicized version of hard rock. Two highly touted early 2005
albums, the self-titled debut from LCD Soundsystem and Mu's ''Out of
Breach,'' have a rough-hewn, ''live'' garage punk feel to much of
their contents.

Other currently hot outfits like Black Strobe, Tiefschwarz and Kiki
hark back to 80's alternative rock genres like Goth and industrial.
Kiki's ''End of the World,'' for instance, features the Finnish-born
producer paying vocal homage to the doomy, hollow-drone baritone of
Andrew Eldritch of the goth-rock gods Sisters of Mercy. Perhaps the
most bizarre example of dance music ransacking rock's archives was
last year's fad for schaffel (German for shuffle), which involved
producers renovating the stomping rhythms of 70's glam rock artists
like T. Rex and Gary Glitter. It's hard to say whether all these
different forms of rockified techno represent a subconscious attempt
by the scene to ingratiate its way back into the mainstream, or are
simply a case of producers looking for genre-crossing thrills. But
none of them exactly restake dance music's claim as the music of the
future.

Alongside its commitment to constant innovation, another central tenet
of dance culture was the idea of being underground, an outlaw scene.
In the early days, dance culture was oriented around one-off raves in
unusual locations, often involving organizers breaking into warehouses
or invading outdoor spaces. Proper safety codes were rarely observed,
drugs were rife and the behavior of the participants verged on
anarchy. Gradually, the thrills and dangers of raves were replaced by
the more reliable pleasures offered by superclubs -- organized by
professionals and regularly scheduled but still fairly wild in terms
of drug-fueled hedonism.

Today, the action is mostly in small clubs -- like APT (419 West 13th
Street) and Ikon (610 West 56th Street) in Manhattan -- in some cases
barely more than glorified bars. There, the audience exudes a
clean-cut, metrosexual aura. At times it feels as if the room has been
teleported to a chic bar in Barcelona or Berlin, especially as, more
often than not, the D.J. is from Europe. Germany, in particular, is
the spiritual homeland for American dance hipsters these days. Most of
the leading labels -- Kompakt, B-Pitch Control, Playhouse, Get
Physical -- are based there. In fact, some North American D.J.'s and
producers like Richie Hawtin have moved to Germany because the climate
for electronic music is more supportive.

If neither sonic futurism nor underground edginess apply any longer,
electronic dance music's remaining raison d'etre is, well, dancing.
But in recent years it may have been beaten on the shake-your-booty
front by dancehall and Southern rap. In response, some dance producers
have started to draw upon raucously vibrant ''street'' beats: crunk,
Miami bass, dancehall, grime and so forth.

The result is a growing hybrid genre, highlighted on the recent,
excellent compilation ''Shockout,'' known as ''breakcore.'' Purveyed
by artists like DJ/Rupture and Teamshadetek, the music combines
rumbling basslines, fidgety beats and grainy ragga vocals to create a
home-listening surrogate for the ''bashment'' vibe of a Jamaican sound
system party. Others within the breakcore genre, like Knifehandchop,
Kid 606 and Soundmurderer, hark back to rave's own early days, their
music evoking the rowdy fervor of a time when huge crowds flailed
their limbs to a barrage of abstract noise and convulsive rhythm. It's
a poignant aural mirage of a time when techno music was made for the
popular vanguard rather than a connoisseurial elite, as it is today.

Today's sharpest contemporary dance music operators, like Tiefschwarz
or LCD Soundsystem, are roughly equivalent to recombinant rock auteurs
of the 90's like PJ Harvey and Pavement, who generated sounds that
weren't strictly innovative but managed to somehow feel original.
Tiefschwarz's brothers-in-production duo Ali and Basti Schwarz and
LCD's James Murphy have an almost scholarly knowledge of dance music
history. They're adept at getting period sounds, but they combine them
in fresh ways.

On LCD's album and Tiefschwarz's superb remix collection ''Misch
Masch,'' we don't really encounter the shock of the new; instead we
get the frisson of novelty, subtle twists and cunning permutations
within an established form. Which will have to be enough for now,
until dance music producers once again figure out how to smack
listeners upside the head with sonic strangeness.

But what did we learn from 1980's?  The "disco" producers that didn't fall 
off the planet started making house music. The club scene was re-born.  Then 
combining the underground house scene with "techno" gave birth to rave... 
and the music lived on.

hmm....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Simon Reynold's New York Times article  

I don't think it's just electronic music going down hill.  I think it's
music in genaral.  Actually, the world in genaral.
There's shit going on in other parts of the world.  Not in america though.
I mean....Ludacris is played on the radio nowadays.  I'm sorry, but the
melodies for "get back",  sound SOOOOOOO incredibly cheesy it's disgustin.
Music is taking a shit, cuz society is.  Everything is just so "Blah"
anymore.  What we need is a paradigm shift.  Complete.  New ways of
thinking, progressing as a human species.  Then, I think this dead end the
music industry has reached, and of course life in genaral, will unfold into
a new appreciation.  Maybe, if we progress into a new form of tribalism, the
rave will come back.  The rave will always be there, in one form or another.
We gotta look at who's runnin the shows though.  Poeple lookin to make
money.  The monetary system need to evolve.  Music can't really go any
further as far as I'm concerned, cuz the human mind really hasn't.  However,
good tracks, will still be written.  Parties will still be had.

My insight is that the "big" "techno" acts he chose to prove his 
point represent the "rock-n-roll" of electronic music.  I do have a 
soft spot for Daft Punk, but a lot of it is still rock-n-roll.

i don't agree, the music hasn't fragmented any further

in europe and all the cool people moved there.
socal and nyc are not the epicenter of the universe

Iraq Faces Ban On 'Music For Pleasure'

Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the 'moderate' Shia leader widely tipped as 
Iraq's
next leader, is hoping to outlaw recreational music, The Independent 
reported
this week.

The Ayatollah hopes to introduce Sharia law into the country, the paper 
said,
with far reaching consequences for Iraqi society.

"Once he assumes control, chess will be forbidden, likewise women will not 
be
allowed to shake hands with men," said leading British columnist Richard 
Ingrams
(writing in the Observer about the report). "Men will be forbidden to say 
their
prayers while wearing earrings. Music will only be permitted 'if it is not 
for
enjoyment'.

12 months previously Mohammed Fartusi, the mullah of Baghdad's biggest 
mosque
al-Heqma, publicly branded discothques 'symbols of western influence' and 
also
called for singing and dancing to be banned.

http://www.homa.org/Details.asp?View=Detail&ContentID=2137352848&TOCID=2083225444
Sharia dress codes explained: 'Women who do not comply with the strict rules 
of
hijab (the veil) promote a contemptuous attitude towards themselves, 
becoming
mere objects for men's pleasure. Moreover, such conduct causes a drop in the
marriage rate. A woman with a pleasant appearance hinders other girls from
finding a husband. It also makes the selection difficult for men. They will
constantly think of a model who is beyond everybody . . .": Human rights
organisation Homa Darabi Foundation)

Iraq Faces Ban On 'Music For Pleasure'

Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the 'moderate' Shia leader widely tipped as
Iraq's
next leader, is hoping to outlaw recreational music, The Independent
reported
this week.

The Ayatollah hopes to introduce Sharia law into the country, the paper
said,
with far reaching consequences for Iraqi society.

"Once he assumes control, chess will be forbidden, likewise women will not
be
allowed to shake hands with men," said leading British columnist Richard
Ingrams
(writing in the Observer about the report). "Men will be forbidden to say
their
prayers while wearing earrings. Music will only be permitted 'if it is not
for
enjoyment'.

12 months previously Mohammed Fartusi, the mullah of Baghdad's biggest
mosque
al-Heqma, publicly branded discothques 'symbols of western influence' and
also
called for singing and dancing to be banned.

http://www.homa.org/Details.asp?View=Detail&ContentID=2137352848&TOCID=2083225444
Sharia dress codes explained: 'Women who do not comply with the strict rules
of
hijab (the veil) promote a contemptuous attitude towards themselves,
becoming
mere objects for men's pleasure. Moreover, such conduct causes a drop in the
marriage rate. A woman with a pleasant appearance hinders other girls from
finding a husband. It also makes the selection difficult for men. They will
constantly think of a model who is beyond everybody . . .": Human rights
organisation Homa Darabi Foundation)

its funny that anyone would be offended by that comment. i mean, 
are you looking at it like im saying this? im just repeating 
things that conservatives say since you know mr entropy is a gay 
conservative christian now. which makes a whole lot of sense. 

if its any consolation, i like fags alot better than i like jesus. 
its not even close, actually :P

its funny that anyone would be offended by that comment. i mean, 
are you looking at it like im saying this? im just repeating 
things that conservatives say since you know mr entropy is a gay 
conservative christian now. which makes a whole lot of sense. 

if its any consolation, i like fags alot better than i like jesus. 
its not even close, actually :P

repeating a behavior is just as bad as condoning a behavior.

little integrity.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} freeware

i downloaded it...kicked the tires a little bit...it's DECENT...it's
certainly the best freeware app i've seen specifically for DJ's.

here's my critique/constructive criticisms:

the good:
*seems to run solid as a rock on an older machine (athlon 650, crap 8mb
video,

*i like the fact that the grooves change to match the breakdowns in the
track. that's actually pretty cool. very VERY easy to see and judge
remaining time on a track with both the grooves and digital clock. i dig
that.

*reverse feature is nice.

*cue point is easy to set and recall. pretty instant start/cue.

*easy, straightforward setup. maybe with a little investigation and
reverse-engineering, the author could figure out a way to code the app to
use a multi-chanel single sound card (like with front/rear outputs)...those
on limited budgets are more apt to have this type of sound card than to
spring for a new second card. it's been done. i've seen it.

now, the bad or the "eh"....
* there's no way to "un-load" an mp3 from the player to change the device
settings. you have to actually close the app.

* as for needle placement and the pick-up/replace feature, while it makes
sense on paper, is kind of counter-intuitive, since CTRL+R and CTRL+P are on
opposite sides of the keyboard, so you can't do a one-hand motion...it
should be the same key toggling both.

* the platters/windows should be sizable. i've got 1024x768 resolution, and
the decks don't fit side to side.

* opening 2 instances of the app causes the "can't register hotkeys" error
to appear... and made the audiblel "ding" error....

* either faster load times on the tracks, or when it does the load-scan, it
should write an index file and store it somewhere. 20+ seconds to load a
track is a bit much, 'specially if you accidentally load the wrong song.

* why only 45 rpm? why not 33?

that's what i've got so far. thanks for passing this on, patrick.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} freeware

Gotta love it for a lot of reasons. Another fine product from a co-op 
member (em411.com). If I recall correctly, he wrote it for the hell of 
it, but everyone there went nuts over it. A lot of wicked things come 
from members there, like the lazslo soundblox -- the flash mp3 player 
used a lot of places, archive.org for one. There's a lot of innovative 
people there who do lots of insane things like this, for no other reason 
than because they can. Other things you can find there from trolling 
around include Trash80's Reaktor Suite and gobs of innovative patches 
for every sound program known to man. monoraveik is really open to 
suggestions last time I checked, so if you have any requests, forward 
them on.

I am purchasing a large item from a canadian seller and I'm feeling the pain 
of the weak dollar.  Combine that with how much I'm paying in taxes for last 
year and it comes out to 20% of my total income for the year.  Fun.

This is really what we have to be thankful for.  The e puddles of fucked up 
kids who don't give a shit are gone.  Good.  True heads remain,  if thats 20 
people then fine.

I know I will personally make and listen to electronic music until I die and 
I don't care what the state of the industry is in.

I feel bad for all the true heads that were turned off because they were 
exposed during the okenfold rave culture years.  I mean what free thinking 
individual with deep convictions would take up that torch.  If I came up 
during that time I would dismiss all those people as idiots and move on. 
The exposure to quality just wasn't there and we lost a lot of quality 
people because of it.  Did they move into the now bigger indie rock scene? 
Probably.

Technically, that'd be the Jewish Old Testament God that did the whole 
lotta smiting.  Jesus' God loves everyone.

Meanwhile, more people have been killed in the name of religion than by 
pretty much anything else.  Including AIDS, the Bubonic Plague, handgun 
violence, wifebeating, and daytime soap opera.

"Technically, that'd be the Jewish Old Testament God that did the whole lotta
smiting"

True, with a few exceptions.  God does a little slaughtering in the New
Testament.  For all you Bible scholars, In the book of Acts, there are
situations were people dropped dead for disobeying God. For example, Chapter 5
talks of a couple who cheated their tithe. When the Apostle Peter confronted
them, they dropped dead. Then in Chapter 12, God smited King Herod for not
giving God glory.  God doesn't perform any smiting or tourturing again until
the book of Revelation, around the 13th chapter or a little later.

<yes, I do read my word.  Not as much as I used to, but I read it.>

i'm pretty sure that somewhere in there there was a statement "love
thy neighbor" and last time i read it it didn't say "love thy straight
neighbor"

pick an avenue to pick on gays that doesnt involve something that is
disputable and documented, like saying 'tom cox hates gays'.  That way
you wont have to weasel your way out of an ignorant moment.  Integrity
AND accountability.

i know we can try to play games with bible quotes and i can pull
out all the old goodies that point out beating women, cannibalism,
etc etc but thats so worthless. the point being that the idea of
mixing conservative politics with christianity brings up lots of
really awesome contradictions not the least of which involves
hypocrisy.

theres no weaseling. if i was going to make statements of people i
dont like i would say things like "fuck a white person" which i
say quite frequently. im nothing if not very straightforward.

Subject: {pb-cle} R.I.P. Dr gonzo

By CATHERINE TSAI
Associated Press Writer

DENVER (AP) -- Hunter S. Thompson, the acerbic counterculture writer
who popularized a new form of fictional journalism in books like "Fear
and Loathing in Las Vegas," fatally shot himself Sunday night at his
Aspen-area home, his son said. He was 67.

"Hunter prized his privacy and we ask that his friends and admirers
respect that privacy as well as that of his family," Juan Thompson
said in a statement released to the Aspen Daily News.

Pitkin County Sheriff Bob Braudis, a personal friend of Thompson,
confirmed the death to the News. Sheriff's officials did not return
calls to The Associated Press late Sunday.

Juan Thompson found his father's body. Thompson's wife, Anita, was not
home at the time.

Besides the 1972 drug-hazed classic about Thompson's visit to Las
Vegas, he also wrote "Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72."
The central character in those wild, sprawling satires was "Dr.
Thompson," a snarling, drug- and alcohol-crazed observer and
participant.

Thompson is credited with pioneering New Journalism - or, as he dubbed
it, "gonzo journalism" - in which the writer made himself an essential
component of the story. Much of his earliest work appeared in Rolling
Stone magazine.

"Fiction is based on reality unless you're a fairy-tale artist,"
Thompson told the AP in 2003. "You have to get your knowledge of life
from somewhere. You have to know the material you're writing about
before you alter it."

An acute observer of the decadence and depravity in American life,
Thompson also wrote such collections "Generation of Swine" and "Songs
of the Doomed." His first ever novel, "The Rum Diary," written in
1959, was first published in 1998.

Thompson was a counterculture icon at the height of the Watergate era,
and Richard Nixon once said he represented "that dark, venal, and
incurably violent side of the American character."

Thompson also was the model for Gary Trudeau's balding "Uncle Duke" in
the comic strip "Doonesbury" and was portrayed on screen by Johnny
Depp in a film adaptation of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."

Other books include "The Great Shark Hunt," "Hell's Angels" and "The
Proud Highway." His most recent effort was "Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the
Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness."

His compound in Woody Creek, not far from Aspen, was almost as
legendary as Thompson. He prized peacocks and weapons; in 2000, he
accidentally shot and slightly wounded his assistant, Deborah Fuller,
trying to chase a bear off his property.

Apostle Peter confronted them, they dropped dead.>>

I have a sneaking suspicion this was added as a pean to the "eccumenical
politicians" who had a Church to build, and needed some good old-fashioned
fund-raising. Really, why would God give a damn about money?

What easier way is there to get money than to say "God says so..."???

In the book and the movie the lead character is Raoul Duke and his
attorney is Dr. Gonzo.  In real life Hunter is Dr. Gonzo.  I dunno,
I'm confused too.

R.I.P. anywho.

Well thats my point.  The normal aging process of the "kids" combined with 
the lack of replacements killed things off quickly when you stagnate and not 
offer something real.

Lets watch the us military over the next few years to see another example of 
this ;p

no kidding. certainly doing something because it's right instead
of "in gods name" is more committed to decency. obviously those of
you who would defend a christian church missed those points in the
bible where christ himself blew off people who made a big deal out
of their faith in god to make people think more highly of them.

<<obviously those of you who would defend a christian church missed those
points in the
bible where christ himself blew off people who made a big deal out of their
faith in god to make people think more highly of them.>>

i will defend the ideal of the Church that Jesus created and commissioned.

i will not, however, defend the current incarnation of the Catholic Church
(the only one I can speak of with a great level of accuracy), as it has been
overrun with the politicians, double talkers, and morally questionable men
that Jesus railed against.

Jesus had the right idea. it's mostly the people after him that fucked it up
for everyone else.

Dunno.  Those hospitals, you know, charge money to stay open. 

Soup kitchens and shelters?  You're kidding, right?  Millions of people 
have died in religious wars.  Soup kitchens?  What??

I'm fine with God.  I just fucking hate his fan clubs.

It's much easier on the mind to just believe in something.  If the entire 
world was godless we would probably have less wars and deaths like that but 
everybody would be constantly thinking about there own deaths and it would 
end productivity as a race.  I believe god was written into our code early 
on so that we didn't have to tackle the bigger question and get on with 
living.  If we accept that then we can say there is no god but that it is 
completely natural for humans to believe in one or more of them.

Some studies are showing there is a god spot in the brain that becomes very 
active during religious "ecstasy".  This spot also contributes to the 
sensations you feel at some musical events and possibly even the creativity 
of the human race.

I've heard of that enlightenment spot or whatever it's called.  Think 
it becomes active durring other times too, but can't remember.

I don't think about death because I don't fear it.  I could drop dead 
in the middle of this email and aside from being disappointed in not 
ever doing some things I wanted to do.  I fear getting old, that's it.  
If I die at 35 I'd be happy.  Hopefully all the main things I want to 
do will be accomplished by then, I won't be old and withered and have 
to deal with everyone dieing around me.  If I ever get some sort of 
cancer or something that is otherwise inoperable and is just going to 
cost money in hospital bills I plan on just ODing on a lot of sleeping 
pills.

Fundamentalist "christians" scare me more than any other kind of 
religious zealot. It never ceases to amaze me how many people around me 
condone or are not outraged by abortion clinic bombings, violence 
against women, and hatred of any kind against any people. People I work 
with who say things like "they had it coming to them" when bad things 
happen to people. It's just twisted.

What I really can't seem to wrap my head around is that there are more 
people in the old good US of A that are complete wackjobs along these 
lines than not.

Sunspot activity is going to be higher than average for the cycle during 
the next few days, I should be better able to pick up some DX radio 
stations and get some good recordings of some of these nuts who bring 
their facist message to the airwaves. I've heard "preachers" that have 
congregations that do agree with "aids cures fags" and the like, and I 
dunno about y'all, but it's just pretty fucked up if you ask me.

I have some pretty crap low-qual recordings of some relgious nuts from 
before still up @ http://www.l4m3.com/archives/shortwave/index.html -- 
including the one damning kids who think they might be gay.

I need a nap or a quaalude or something.

So now you wonder how many people are actually going here and learning the 
"Ian Knot" :)  ...like me.  I don't like that I can't get it as tight as the 
regular one, although I guess it is faster, ain't no "split second" as he 
says, though.

Millions of people have died over struggles of power, land, greed, ideas of
all kinds.

Millions of people also learned to read because of monks.  Thousands of
colleges were set up by churches and monestaries.

A sizeable portion of religious folks actually have deepset honest
good-hearted beliefs overall that don't always jive with the stigmatic dogma
of the far right.

I'll give you an example.  My uncle is a Quaker, and a deeply religious man.
His main job is that he offers counsel and solice to people in Hospice and
their family members.  Oh yeah, and he's gay.  Funny that his relationship
with his partner is probably better and healthier than that of my parents
(who are divorced), my other uncle (twice divorced), or my brothers (tons of
infighting).

There's a reason wackjobs are called "the far right".  They're not
mainstream.

Religion in and of itself is not a bad thing.  The idea that there might be
something larger than us is a humbling thought, although it could all just
be aliens.  I don't believe in the Creation and all that crap, but the
simple fact that respect for others and their thoughts is a great thing.
The irony is that zealots of all kinds have a hard time with that, be they
religious fanatics or just hard-core liberals.

I'm waiting for someone to say "You're wrong, and I can prove it", and back
it up with something more than theory or just "accepted knowledge".  Because
it used to be "accepted knowledge" that the world was flat.

I think you missed my point.  More people have been killed in the name 
of religion than for pretty much any other cause.  This has nothing to 
do with the Bush administration and/or the far right.  This has nothing 
to do with many religious people being damn fine folks.

Again, you're generalizing and stereotyping.

What was the religious impetous behind the Civil War?  The Vietnam War?
WWI?  Any wars fought by Rome, Greece, tribal wars in Africa, wars all over
Asia.   People have been getting killed in large numbers since humans
discovered rocks could do some damage.

I'd say land grabs, political power, and ethnic ties have killed far more
people than "my god can beat up your god".

I agree with the idea that human misuse of  religion for power is a horrible
thing.  But people always forget anything good that comes from religion and
religious folks.  Hence my pointing out hospitals, soup kitchens, etc.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Wish Nightclub is pleased to announce, coming back to Cleveland, DJ 
Skribble...on Thursday, February 24rd, 2004...

Selecting a house and hip hop set...

On "ESSENTIAL DANCE 2000," Atlantic's first joint release with the 
Warner Essential label, the one-and-only DJ Skribble spins pop, house, 
electronica, hip hop and progressive trance into a boombastic 
multi-artist mix which makes it perfectly clear why MTVs own superstar 
DJ is tops both in his field and on the dance floor. Capturing all the 
vibe and vitality of a live Skribble club set, " "ESSENTIAL DANCE 2000" 
"sees this master dj blending hit tracks - from an eclectic array of 
musicians such as Moby, Cher, Filter, William Orbit, the Vengaboys, 
Fragma, and even Bob Marley - with his own idiosyncratic brand of 
anything-goes mixing. "A DJ should be able to go into any kind of party 
and adapt to any kind of situation," Skribble says. "If youre not 
versatile, you just trap yourself into a corner. I pride myself on 
trying to play many different styles of music. I can go to a hardcore 
hip hop club, play for those kids, then go to a hardcore rave and play 
the hardest trance set. What makes a great DJ is the ability to play for 
anybody."

rizumu
SATURDAY FEBRUARY 26TH 2005 > > > PHILADELPHIA
shawn rudiman + lukas owens + adam ratana + jwan allen + matt knyc
[ technoirAudio : pittsburgh ] 3 hr live performance

On this February night, for three straight hours, five electronic
musicians combine their talents to bring you a massive live
performance. Their palette will be an excessive amount of studio
hardware, a PC, and a crate of vinyl. With Shawn, Lukas, and Matt at
the helm of the insanity, Jwan and Adam will complement their live
work through the dj mixer, manipulating and adding elements to the
mix.

Maintaining strong links to Detroit techno, Shawn Rudiman's 2004
performance at "Green Lights Go"-a highlight moment at Detroit's
annual Movement Festival-saw him simultaneously working his live set
along with legendary artists Claude Young and Anthony "Shake" Shakir.
Expect a similar experience this month at rizumu, courtesy of Funkshun
and the Technoir collective.

Technoiraudio is committed and dedicated to releasing only quality
material with strong ideas, direction, personality, and
feeling-striving for definition that cannot simply be packaged into
neatly labeled bins. Complimentary copies of Shawn Rudiman's
Synthesexual LP will be given out in celebration of the new release.

Could you add this too? :
 
This event will feature the body painting of exotic dancers by:

CAMILO PARDO

Camilo Pardo has drawn and re-drawn the Ford GT in his mind for more 
than a decade. Those years of mental sketching will pay off for the 
Ford GT chief designer this year, when hell be able to see his modern 
reissue of the 1960s-era racing legend hit the streets.As an 
accomplished designer, artist, sculptor, clothing and furniture 
designer, Camilos work has been featured on roadways  as well as in 
galleries and shows  worldwide. From autobahns in Germany and cafs in 
Italy to the walls of the Detroit Institute of Arts, to the stages of 
the Paris Motor Show, his art reflects his love for innovation and 
design. Being an artist really complements my car designs. I can't 
imagine having one without the other, Camilo says. Both require me 
to deal with proportions, emotions and creativity, which all lead to 
perfect execution.Camilo is a native New Yorker who says he knew at a 
young age that both art and automotive design would drive his career 
path.
To follow the dream, he enrolled at the Center for Creative Studies in 
Detroit, where he graduated and was granted the Industrial Design 
Society of America Merit Award in 1985. Immediately following his 
graduation, he joined Fords design staff in Dearborn, keeping an easy 
commute to his downtown Detroit art studio and apartment, where he still 
lives and works on his other artistic endeavors in his spare time.

We are looking forward to having such a very talented and recognized 
artist creating his unique style of body painting at our event.

LOCKDOWN


KLUTE
(drum and bass)
London, UK // Metalheadz, Commercial Suicide, BBS

If the term pioneer held any meaning in the world of Drum and Bass, 
you'd find DJ Klute's picture listed somewhere by it in the 
dictionary. With releases on such paramount labels as Hospital and 
Headz, and with DJ gigs from New York to New Zealand, saying Klute is 
merely a staple would be an understatement. For years, his tracks 
have been in constant heavy rotation in nearly every Jungle DJs crate. 
His label, Commercial Suicide, has boasted releases from the likes of 
D.Kay, Calibre, Digital, and Total Science. Now with the highly 
acclaimed release of his 4th LP last December, his latest mix CD for the 
Metalheadz Americas, and having just been featured on the cover of the 
infamous Knowledge Magazine, it's safe to say the reign of Klute has 
begun!

Sat Mar 12                    THE MISSING PEACE                     Toronto

"If we are incapable of finding peace in ourselves, it is pointless to 
search elsewhere."
------------- Francois de la Rochefoucauld

For too many years we have branded ourselves by genres, crews and 
cliques. We abandoned togetherness, and closed our minds to the 
limitless possibilities of music. We became so focused on our scene of 
choice that we have forgotten what captured our imagination that very 
first night. We have forgotten our commonality through music. We have 
forgotten the connective link. Together on March 12th 2005, we will 
place:

    Area 1 - The Conundrum

    No Left Turn
    (San Francisco, USA) (KFA, K12, Liquid Vinyl)
    This man is perhaps the most talented happy hardcore DJ in North 
America. His genre-hopping, aggressive, high BPM mixes on up to six 
turntables inspire awe in all those who have seen or heard him play. On 
this night he will be playing a two hour extended set that will take you 
on a journey that none shall soon forget.

    Dynamic vs. enD vs. Everybodies Daddy vs. Gobstoppa - Extended Set
    (Nocturnal Comissions/GXF)(Pitched Up Recordings, Goodfellaz)(FPS, 
    Hullabaloo)(Everywhere, Toronto)
    Four of Toronto's most talented performers converge on one stage for 
an hour and a half of absolute mayhem. All of them are skilled as DJs 
and as MCs, and all will showcase both abilities in an all out back to 
back to back to back battle of gabber, jungle, and happy hardcore.

    DJ Wolf vs. DJ Tranzit - Extended Set
    (Future Perfect Synergy, icantstopraving.com)
    Future Perfect Synergy co-founders, both of them crowd favourites 
every time they play. The Toronto scratchmaster pits classics, upfront 
bangers and newschool anthems against Tranzits classic anthems, 
pitched up euro, and who knows what else for one and a half hours of 
crowd-pleasing business.

    Dr. Fritz
    (Sourkee, BetterThan, ONdaFLY, Spacemonkey, Soundbwoy)
    As a DJ, Dr. Fritz is one of Toronto's best kept secrets. He is a 
veteran DJ and producer, whos coming out of the studio just for you. 
His style of Jungle can only be described as mashed up ragga jump-up, 
thats as intricately mixed as it is varied.

    D-Minus
    (Hullabaloo! ATM, E-Mail, Nightmare, Rave N Beats Canada)
    Always a crowd favourite wherever he plays, D-Minus has been shaking 
down dance floors across North America since 1997. Hes guaranteed to 
mash up the the venue with the quick cutting and track selection. 
Garaunteed anthems; Garaunteed sing-a-long; You know the score.

    Mizz Lee
    (The Business, Kooterkore)
    Mizlee is another quickly rising star in our scene. Starting as a 
happy hardcore DJ, evolving to breakbeat hardcore, and now regarded as 
one of Londons finest jungle selectors, her set promises to reflect 
her musical history, and eclectic personality.

    No Frills
    (statis.org, Iceberg)
    Making his return to Toronto's hardcore scene after far too long an 
absence, No Frills is bringing his years of experience, insane 
scratching skills, and records spanning ten years of Happy Hardcore 
history for you.

    s-capade
    (hardcoretechno.ca)
    For far too long a virtual unknown in Toronto, s-capade continues to 
toil relentlessly on the decks, churning out the finest hardcore techno 
mixes in the city. Do not miss his set, because it will be unlike 
anything you've heard in Toronto before.

    MC Everybodies Daddy
    (Future Perfect Synergy, Hullabaloo!, icantstopraving.com, ONdaFLY)
    The third piece of the Future Perfect Synergy puzzle, MCED brings 
his commanding stage presence, quick freestyle rhymes, and boundless 
energy to play for you.

    MC Gobstoppa
    (Hullabaloo, Goodfellaz, M'asstadon, Totally Sweet Radio)
    Arguably the number one Happy Hardcore MC in North America, this man 
is a fixture at every hardcore event in Toronto, and for good reason. 
His contagious energy and endless supply of rhymes turn every party he 
plays in to a madhouse.

    MC enD
    (Goodfellaz, GXF, Pitched Up Recordings)
    One of the finest freestyle MCs you will ever have a chance to 
experience. He flows smoothly over everything from drum n' bass to 
gabber with his own distinct sound, and razor sharp wit.

    Dynamic MC
    (Nocturnal Comissions, GXF)
    Quickly rising through the ranks of MCs in Toronto, Dynamic 
possesses a love for happy hardcore that rivals his love of 
Jagermeister. Any combination of the two, and he's guaranteed to take 
you on an adventure you wont soon remember!

    Area 2 - The Enigma
    Hosted by Dr. Fritz

    DJ Antik (Ottawa)
    (Ministry of Sound DJs, Eclipse Productions, 88.5 KOC FM)
    DJ Antik is one of the best house DJs you will experience, period. 
Rock solid, creative mixing, mastery of effects, and scratching are 
second nature to this man. Hes bringing bags and bags of funky, 
driving house, breaks and techno, and were giving him two solid hours 
to shake you to your very soul.

    T & A - JustinTyce & Adam Addison
    (www.ONdaFLY.net, Houseing Project, www.beatfreakers.com, Future 
Perfect Synergy)
    FPS residents JustinTyce & Adam Addison are favourites of the 
Toronto scene for good reason. Every time they play, the dancefloor 
becomes packed, the vibe rises to a whole new level, and the sweat 
starts to drip. Two hours will hardly seem like enough time for this duo 
to rock your world.

    DJ XTC
    (Quantum, Citrus, Delirium)
    He's been workin' out, eatin' his wheaties and drinkin' his milk. 
After years in a senior citizens home, the old man is breaking free. For 
this night only, he's bringing back the hardstyle. A staple in the 
Toronto underground throughout the 90's, XTC tore up the masses with 
turntablism, aggressive mixing and unmatched creativity. With the help 
of a few Geritol, he claims this set will not be surpassed for years.

    PlasticMotive
    (Sourkee, Goodfellaz, Funkadelic, ONdaFLY, BetterThan)
    Another veteran of the Toronto breaks scene, PlasticMotive plays 
hard funky breaks to drive the dancefloor insane. When the man behind 
Sourkee and ReForm checks in, there's no way that the crowd can sit 
down.

    DJ Opel
    (Nightmare, Terror Inc. 2theBeat.com, Embedded)
    Rapidly becoming a crowd favourite for his eclectic and 
unpredictable style, and ability to rock venues in any one of a number 
of genres. Opel will be bringing the dark, hard UK techno on this one, 
so come prepared to rock the fuck out!

    Elixir
    (discotoast.com, Hullabaloo!)
    A Toronto favourite for many years, Elixir promises to take you on 
an epic journey through trance, pushing you to your limits of endurance, 
and the peaks of ecstasy. Close your eyes, and let Elixir sweep you off

Fair enough.  :-)

I'll change up my rant, I guess.

The other day, someone mentioned that the Holocaust wasn't only Jews.  
They apparently also waxed homosexuals, mentally and physically retarded 
people, and most of the gypsies. 

Anyone confirm/deny that one?  Also, is (would it be) correct to refer 
to the whole thing as the Holocaust?

I'm confused because I was taught one thing, while another seems to be 
the case.  That's not unusual, though, it seems.

Dean,

I can't tell if you're being sarcastic here or serious? So I will
respond as if you are serious - yes, definitely more than Jews were
"waxed" or "killed" as I prefer to say.  Who taught you that only Jews
were killed?  By far they were the most persecuted and executed group
number wise, but it wasn't exclusive to them.  And I think you can
call it the Holocaust without offending anyone, other than the people
who like to argue it never happened.  (Tom perhaps? :) that's the only
person on this list I can even think of who might have the balls to
even try, or Entropy.

i dont think that this was NOT taught, it was just on such a
smaller scale compared the millions of german jews who were killed.

cant wait for it


i still think that mastering is best done via-rewire and cubase(2 band eq on
the reason mixer bleh)....but if the new compressor should be better for
controlling track dynamics...the combiner is the real treat for the upgrade
as i see it though...i use multiple synths and samplers all the time to
create layered sounds...it would be nice to be able to save all the routing
like a preset.

the line mixer looks like it'll be nice for doing rough sub-mixes before
rewire too

again, i think anyone relying on what other people tell you for
their education is going to be sorely lacking. 

anyway, its not "eugenics", its the systematic wiping out of a
people. i visited the concentration camp Dauchau outside of
munich, ive never in my life visited a darker place. they had
pictures of the "experiments" they used to do on jews there like
depressurization chambers where their eardrums would burst out of
their heads. any aryan shit that hitler might have gone on about
was nonsense anyway, the man himself wouldnt have been included in
the aryan race if there were one. it was simply an excuse to
murder any minority he found offensive. and he did quite a bit of it.

The holocaust included homosexuals, the retarded, gypsies, catholics, 
and any other group that wasn't the norm. There were just more jews than 
the other groups.

The pink triangles that you see dotting cars everywhere came from the 
way Nazis put patches on homosexuals during and before the war to 
identify them.

Of course, certain high ranking Nazis were also known to throw parties 
where they gathered up all the young boys they could find and had sex 
with them to keep their youth, also known as "the michael jackson defense".

I fucking hate Nazis and Michael Jackson.

'old up 'old up 'old up.... Something just made me think about this, and 
now its time to come back to the thread.

Lets forget the fact that this event happened in Italy for a moment. 
Does a 700 Euro fine per song sound at ALL even REMOTELY reasonable? Ok, 
even forget this part.

Here's a link to a different write-up of the same story... it has some 
additional quotes that make this interesting:
http://www.dancefrontdoor.co.uk/article3884.html

Now, from an authorship standpoint, an artist (well, the label really) 
has reproduction rights and communication rights. ASCAP handles the 
licensing fees here stateside as far as the communication rights go, and 
its to be paid by the venue. A bit down, you'll see a quote from Enzo 
Mazza and what he says is total BS. I'd have to dig out my entertainment 
law books to refresh my memory about goings on across the pond, but if 
you ask me, this is total spin (no pun intended). Shouldn't have the 
club been fined as well? If the artists didn't see a cent from the play 
of this DJ's material, isn't the club at fault because it was played in 
public and they didn't handle their licensing correctly? While still 
somewhat morally objectable, was what the DJ did anything worse than 
millions of people do at home?

Wouldn't something like a 10,000 Euro fine, making him/her actually buy 
all the songs, be more appropriate? Is a 1,390,00 Euro dickhead fee 
appropriate?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Italian DJ Fined 1.4 Mln Euros for Music Piracy

Something else that struck me odd, that I really didn't think about until
yesterday...

Wasn't Italy one of the biggest sources of bootleg CD's throughout the 80's
and 90's? I remember loads of Kiss The Stone and Moonraker bootleg discs at
places like Mook's in Dormont, Eides in the Strip, and a few other
places....many with Italian addresses on them. They had notoriously lax
copyright laws back in the day.

Have they done a 180? Or is this story complete bullshit?

Subject: {pb-cle} George Bush On Drugs- I Haven't Denied Anything

George Bush On Drugs- I Haven't Denied Anything

President Bush was branded a liar and a hypocrite again this week after 
secretly
recorded tapes emerged on which he admitted smoking marijuana and 
deliberately
ignoring questions about both his pot and cocaine use.

The president revealed his scheming tactics in conversation with a friend 
Doug
Wead (an advisor of his father) when he was still a Governor and even 
boasted of
turning his 'immature past' to electoral advantage.

"That's part of my schtick, which is, look, we have all made mistakes," said
Bush.

"What you need to say time and time again is not talk about the details of 
your
transgressions but talk about what I have learned. I've sinned and I've 
learned.
I am just not going to answer those questions," he gloated. (New York Times)

Responding to the tapes, White House spokesman Trent Duffy dutifully 
entirely
ignored the revelations, by following exactly the same tactics as his 
leader.

"That has been asked and answered so many times," he sniffed when asked by 
the
New York Times specifically about Bush's drug habits, "There is nothing more 
to
add."

The story appeared just weeks after Moby challenged George W's integrity in
Mixmag, branding him a 'lying buffoon who can hardly string two sentences
together'.

"Everyone in America knows that George Bush is a liar," the New York techno 
star
pointed out. "He's a draft dodger, he did a lot of cocaine in the 70s and 
80s,
he's never held a real job. He's like your quintessential preppy frat boy 
(Toff
student- slang Ed) but he tells them he's a cowboy. And they believe him," 
said
Moby.

Moby's new single Lift Me Up is out on February 28, with two (pretty good)
remixes provided by Etienne D'Crecy (aka Superdiscount) and new remixer of 
the
moment Abe Duque. He also tours the UK and Eire in May.

American Doctors Examine Ecstasy's Empathy

Scientists in South Carolina are to give MDMA to traumatised American 
soldiers
retuning from Iraq to help them talk about their experiences with 
therapists,
the Guardian has revealed.

Chief study psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer said they hope the drug will 
allow
shell-shocked veterans to discuss traumatic situations without anxiety via
ecstasy's renowned empathetic effects.

"It's looking very promising. It's too early to draw any conclusions but in
these treatment resistant people so far the results are encouraging," Doctor
Mithoefer told the paper.  "People are able to connect more deeply on an
emotional level with the fact they are safe now."

Also in America, scientists at Harvard University are to start giving E to a
small group of terminally ill patients to find out whether the drug works 
better
at alleviating their anxiety than traditional palliatives such as Valium.

'We're trying to avoid sedating people, to allow them to maintain a good 
quality
of life so they can enjoy the time they have with family and friends," study
boss Dr. Todd Shuster fro the Lahey Clinic told the Boston Globe.

''I think it is a drug that has a real potential for therapeutic benefits," 
he
added.

Both studies vindicate ecstasy's hugely respected 'godfather' Dr. Alexander
Shulgin, who in his seminal book TIHKAL (published in 1997) fiercely 
challenged
US authorities' relentless demonisation of the drug.

"The fact remains that MDMA has proven extraordinarily effective in many
clinical applications and therapeutic interventions," Doctor Shulgin pointed
out.

"Here is a drug that has the unusual property of, more often than not, 
freeing a
patient in psychotherapy from the anxiety and lack of trust that often 
prevents
the emotionally fragile person from expressing his feelings to another," he
continued.

"And, as has been attested to by many therapists and patients, MDMA allows a
personal perspective, which is called 'insight', with a minimum amount of 
fear
and self censoring. All this without any loss of self-control or 
rationality."

http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/shulgin/blg/index.html ('Dr. Shulgin now 
works
as a scientific consultant for such clients as the National Institute on 
Drug
Abuse, the Drug Enforcement Administration, NASA, Bristol Laboratories, and 
the
University of California . . .')

I'm more interested in joining The Space Viking Alliance of Scandanavia. 
That there is hot shit.

The combinator will save me sooooo much time. My average drum setup 
takes me about 15 minutes to put together and route. Also, most folks 
haven't paying a lot of attention to it, but one of the best features is 
the new factory soundbank.

The exchange rate is piling on a big pile of suck for the upgrade, 
especially since I'm going to be wanting it in a box. Comes out 3 days 
before my birthday tho, so happy birthday to me.

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP- I may be a nerd, but I have a life. 

So we rolled down to Cbus last night to go see Doc Martin, maybe get some
promotion done. Unfortunately we arrived as they were closing...we'd run
into mad delays... But had enough to get some flyers in hands...

Anyways, went to a private house party and met and talked to one of the few
people that is bad ass at what he does enough to get heavy respekt from me.
I even kept my cool too.

Subject: {pb-cle} Detroit yet again has a festival!! 

I was surprised it hadn't made its debut on the pbcle yet, but I went nuts
when I saw this last night. I'm so skipping WMC for this.


Detroit?s Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce FUSE-in
Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza in Detroit,
Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The festival's
new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a new beginning
and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the City of Detroit,
electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and celebrate
music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all bias." Under
the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, MusicLogical is committed
to building on the integrity and legacy of Detroit music, furthering in the
process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' Mainor,
presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, a
globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, promises to
deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre was chosen to
serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at many
levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, and media
from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California at festivals,
on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his ground-shaking efforts from
lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman of The Generator Foundation, a
European group which profiles itself in Art, Music and Technology. Van
Winden will serve this year as the official International Festival Director,
assisting with foreign sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board
and ministry of culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara Deyo.
Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing and PR, and
has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well as being a
consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's festival.
With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing a massive
shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for broad community
support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at Fifth
Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. Line up
and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of the FUSE-in
Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, information,
schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being planned
for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic
Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am ::
Hart Plaza

if i remember correctly, you were a little bit off in your original

detroit... the first one would be drunken, and the other 2 would be
spent sleeping/passed out in <insert person's name here>'s car.  :)

no, you got that wrong.  He'll spend the first few hours of the first 
day drunk, then passed out in some random place in the park... that 
everyone will be able to find and take humiliating PWNED pictures.  
Then at the end of the night he'll go off and pass out in a car.  
Repeat the next two days.

Anyone from Akron interested in a trip to the 'burgh for 'Spaceship on 
the Highway Tour'? Its a Sunday show but it starts early enough for 
those of us whose with early weekday obligations. I have to admit, I know 
nothing about the Brew House...good space? Warm, cozy? Obtusely 
Gargantuan? I am so ready for this kind of 
stimulus...must...fight...hebetude...need... good..sound. Anyone? I'm not even sure there are any Sun Ra 
flavors on this list. Hit me if you are...I'm going regardless, 
but...company makes it better.

Glad you enjoyed yourself!

Techmix went off pretty well...'twas a drunken sloppy
mess, Strauss played a killer abelton set (no house to
be found...lots of interesting minimal and electro
lines), and Damon and I had a blast breaking out the
electro and acid techno.  This will very likely become
a monthly with techno DJ's from the area as it
exceeded our expectations and was well supported for a
local event, so for those of you in Clevo who dig on
techno keep your eyes and ears open.

Subject: {pb-cle} Reminder: chris liberator this friday

Since I know having an actual rave around here is kinda amazing, here's 
another reminder:

KEEPIN IT HARD!!!

featuring:

CHRIS LIBERATOR
(stay up forever, maximum minimum,Cluster, 4x4 Recordings) LONDON, U.K.
**HARD/ACID TECHNO, 2am-4am**

Chris is a true pioneer of UK techno. With strong roots, ethics, and 
ideals based on the London punk scene in the 80s, he became involved in 
the dance music scene, throwing and DJing at outlaw/squat(Renegade) 
parties in 1991. Evenually, he founded the ACID techno record label Stay 
Up Forever with Paul Harding and fellow Liberator DJs Aaron and Julian 
in 1993. Other labels Chris founded include Cluster in 1995, which is 
hard, dark and non-acid oriented techno, a more recent and raw sounding 
imprint Maximum/Minimum, and the tech-house label Yolk. He has released 
literally hundreds of tracks with varying styles from electro and house 
to techno and hardcore. As a DJ, he has performed in every corner of the 
world. The last time Chris was in this region for an all ages event was 
August 2000. This is a VERY SPECIAL, RARE appearance that you do not 
want to miss. Prepare for one of the most energetic techno sets to be

another reminder:

FRIDAY MARCH 4TH, 2005

Electrasoul proudly presents...

KEEPIN IT HARD!!!

featuring:

CHRIS LIBERATOR
(stay up forever, maximum minimum,Cluster, 4x4 Recordings) LONDON, U.K.
**HARD/ACID TECHNO, 2am-4am**

Chris is a true pioneer of UK techno. With strong roots, ethics, and 
ideals based on the London punk scene in the 80s, he became involved in 
the dance music scene, throwing and DJing at outlaw/squat(Renegade) 
parties in 1991. Evenually, he founded the ACID techno record label Stay 
Up Forever with Paul Harding and fellow Liberator DJs Aaron and Julian 
in 1993. Other labels Chris founded include Cluster in 1995, which is 
hard, dark and non-acid oriented techno, a more recent and raw sounding 
imprint Maximum/Minimum, and the tech-house label Yolk. He has released 
literally hundreds of tracks with varying styles from electro and house 
to techno and hardcore. As a DJ, he has performed in every corner of the 
world. The last time Chris was in this region for an all ages event was 
August 2000. This is a VERY SPECIAL, RARE appearance that you do not 
want to miss. Prepare for one of the most energetic techno sets to be 
dropped in Pittsburgh history.

exceeded our expectations and was well supported for a

techno keep your eyes and ears open.
