             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

it's going to be a really sweet show. Check it out."

[!!!!!!!!]

Saturday, Sept. 17th At Abbasso:

Plate Tectonics Presents TechMix featuring:

Punisher (Seismic Records, Detroit)

We've been wanting to bring Michelle "Punisher" Herrmann in for quite a 
while, and after hearing her set at Fuse-In decided we needed to make it 
happen. Michelle will be gracing us with a live PA/DJ hybrid 
performance. More info and mixes will follow in the coming weeks. Expect 
a night of innovative techno, from minimal to stomping, and possibly 
even some drum and bass thrown in for good measure (she played some live 
at Fuse:in).

This show will be in the $5 range

Sat Oct 08                 MIX 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Cleveland

MIX. ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY w/ HABERSHAM | Abbasso | Cleveland | 
Saturday 10.08.05

HABERSHAM (Blueprint, Global Underground, Audio Therapy)
http://www.blueprintsounds.com

The two minds behind Blueprint Recordings are those of Damon 
Fonooni and Brett Abramson, known in the music industry as 
Habersham and Numinous. Although both come from two very different 
backgrounds, Habersham's roots originating in the UK, and Numinous 
coming out of the early Florida house and progressive scene, they 
both share varied musical influences. These include jazz, classic 
soul and funk, such as Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, Prince, an "Off 
The Wall" Michael Jackson and George Clinton/P-Funk, to Radiohead, 
Nine Inch Nails and early Renaissance house.

Each has been DJing for more than six years and producing original 
music for nearly as long. Together they play varied sounds from 
funky and groovey to deep and headfuck, from techy and tribal to 
melodic and breaky, all of which revolves around their roots in 
house music. Habersham and Numinous' Blueprint club night in 
Atlanta has gained recognition across the globe as being one of 
the only consistent and next-level dance music experiences in the 
Southeastern US, bringing in such groundbreaking artists as Phil 
K, Ashley Casselle, Chris Micali and Ali Ajami.

The music of Blueprint Recordings has already received support 
from Sasha, Sander Kleinenberg, Chris Fortier, Jimmy Van M, Phil 
K, Timo Maas, Martin Villeneuve (MV/Envy), Christopher Lawrence, 
Dave Ralph, Barry Gilbey, Kasey Taylor, Jonathan Ojeda, the 
Scumfrog, Dave Dresden and many, many more. It's house music with 
a subtle funkiness and a deep and dirty edge. The sound of 
Blueprint borrows from classic progressive elements and fuses them 
with quirky sounds of the future, while never losing its ability 
to stimulate the mind and the feet.

No matter the differentiating styles of music you may hear from 
Blueprint, there will always be one constant: pushing minds 
forward and breaking down genre barriers. Conformity:beware.

Doormouse - Miami, FL
Addict, Distort, Planet-Mu, Epileptik, Violent Turd, Schematic, 
Sublight,
CockRockDisco, Zod

Doormouse has been producing some of the most slammingest sick-ass jams 
since 1852. He used a potato and 4 live chickens. Although all masters 
were destroyed by fire, these recordings live on in the hearts and minds 
of the very dead chickens. Now he is the OG Midwest badass and depending 
on which side of the fence you're standing on, Daniel "doormouse" 
Martinstein is either a complete waste of time or a complete waste of 
space. Imagine camping with Dennis Hopper and he roofies you out in the 
woods somewhere and you wake up sewn to a family of badgers. Well he's 
sicker. Take one part Gloria Estefan, one part DJ Paul, one part Guy 
Lombardo and there you have it. Don't worry, we're not sure either. What 
you witness may not be safe.

Fri Nov 04                        D-BRIDGE                        Cleveland

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Well ... I'm sure everyone at this point has heard about the devastation of 
Hurricane Katrina.
Much of the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Alabama is obliterated in the wake 
of the Hurricane, and floodwaters continue to rise in the overwhelmed city 
of New Orleans. Millions of people are suffering from the devastation and 
desperately need water, food, shelter and medical care today, as well as 
help coping with what promises to be a massive long-term recovery effort.

Help meet this enormous need now with a donation.

The staff at Club Havana will be accepting donations tonight that will be 
sent to the Red Cross Disaster Reflief Fund.

Additionally, we are going to be donating $1 for every specialty drink 
ordered tonight (or a % of our bar sales) and our bartenders will be 
donating all of their tips ...
and I'm sure I'll think of some sort of free shot incentive to get you guys 
to give more ...

Please help out!

Also, donations accumulated tonight will be combined with the donations 
received from Innerchild's Hurricane Relief Benefit next week.

Hurricane Katrina Relief Benefit

maybe I should clarify ...

Tonight we will be accepting cash donations only.  Please do not bring any 
canned foods, blankets, etc.  If you want to give ... $$$ is the best way.

Taken from the Red Cross website:

"Financial donations to the Red Cross are the best way to assist victims of 
disaster. Monetary contributions enable the Red Cross to purchase the most 
urgently needed items as close to the disaster site as possible."

and

"Unsolicited, spontaneous donations of goods and services from individuals 
and community groups, though well intentioned, have hidden costs and pose a 
number of complications for relief efforts. For these reasons, the Red Cross 
is unable to accept any large collections of items, such as used clothing, 
hygiene items, furniture, toys, and canned goods. Nor are we able to accept 
small, individual donations of these items."

Thank you.

Subject: {pb-cle} [Detroit] Goodnight Comrade w/Keith Tucker - Tonight, Friday 2nd September 2005


Denis Baldwin Jr - friend to many, acquaintence to all.  You've heard the
rumors, and it's true - he's moving to Florida.  We're not exactly sure
why.. but he's going, and we're sending him off properly.


 GOODNIGHT COMRADE
 a farewell to a friend
 http://sneak.datavibe.net/misc/flyers/20050902-goodnight-comrade

 Friday, 2nd September, 2005 CE
 10PM-10AM, free

 At the Focus Media Bunker:

 440 E. Lafayette (above Niki's Pizza and the Bouzouki)
 Detroit, Michigan

 (877) 748-3467 (my (sneak's) cell for directions or assistance)

This evening, for your listening pleasure, we have worked quite
dilligently to arrange for the following lineup:
 
 *  Keith Tucker
 ** Aux88/Puzzlebox

 *  Benji Hayes
 ** Focus Media

 *  Darkcube
 ** Detroit Techno Militia

 *  Dethlab
 ** Doyle&Bethany

 *  sneak@datavibe.net
 ** hey, that's me

 *  'stos
 ** Fistclencher Records (also, if you're reading this via 313kids, your
 friendly neighborhood list admin!)

 *  T. Linder
 ** Detroit Techno Militia


I've spent the whole day doing the usual party preparation thing -
moving huge cabinets filled with gigantic speakers about from place to
place, connecting large rubbery cables from oversized amplifiers to said
cabinets, buying vast reserves of liquor and that weird 7.3% canadian
beer, disposable plastic cups, ice, et cetera, and generally freaking out.

Much effort is being expended to ensure that everyone that attends has
as much fun as we are by doing all of this.

Additionally, we strongly recommend that before you come to be assaulted
by the waves of bass eminating from our WTF Soundsystem, that you go and
visit our friends Derek Plaslaiko and Ryan Elliott over at Vault
at Oslo this same evening put together by those fine gentlemen at
Ghostly.  That's going to be awesome too and we're all sad we can't be
in two places at once.

I'm going to bed because tomorrow is going to kill us all.  See you
there.

Love,
-j

Subject: {pb-cle} Would you have made the same choice?

Don't look for a punch line. There isn't one. Read it anyway.
My question to all of you is: Would you have made the same choice?


>> At a fund raising dinner for a school that serves learning disabled
>> children, the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would
>> never be forgotten by all who attended.
>>
>> After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a
>> question.
>>
>> "When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature
>> does is done with perfection. Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as
>> other
>> children do. He cannot understand things as other children do. Where is
>> the
>> natural order of things in my son?"
>>
>> The audience was stilled by the query.
>>
>> The father continued. "I believe, that when a child like Shay comes
>> into the world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents
>> itself,
>> and it comes, in the way other people treat that child."
>>
>> Then he told the following story: Shay and his father had walked
>> past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball.
>>
>> Shay asked, "Do you think they'll let me play?"
>>
>> Shay's father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like
>> Shay on their team, but the father also understood that if his son were
>> allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging.
>> Shay's
>> father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could
>> play.
>>
>> The boy looked around for guidance and, getting none, he took
>> matters into his own hands and said, "We're losing by six runs and the
>> game
>> is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to
>> put
>> him in to bat in the ninth inning."
>>
>> In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs
>> but was still behind by three.
>>
>> In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in
>> the outfield.
>>
>> Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to
>> be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his father
>> waved to him from the stands.
>>
>> In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now,
>> with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on
>> base,
>> and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.
>>
>> At this juncture, let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the
>> game?
>>
>> Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was
>> all but impossible 'cause Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat
>> properly, much less connect with the ball.
>>
>> However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher moved in a few
>> steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make
>> contact.
>>
>> The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. The pitcher
>> again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay.
>>
>> As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground
>> ball right back to the pitcher.
>>
>> The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown
>> the ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and that would
>> have
>> been the end of the game.
>>
>> Instead, the pitcher took the ball and turned and threw the ball on
>> a high arc to right field, far beyond the reach of the first baseman.
>>
>> Everyone started yelling, "Shay, run to first! Run to first!"
>>
>> Never in his life had Shay ever made it to first base. He scampered
>> down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.
>>
>> Everyone yelled, "Run to second, run to second!"
>>
>> By the time Shay rounded first base, the right fielder had the ball.
>>
>> He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but
>> he understood the pitcher's intentions and intentionally threw the ball
>> high
>> and far over the third-baseman's head.
>>
>> Shay ran toward second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously
>> circled the bases toward home.
>>
>> Shay reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran to him, turned
>> him in the direction of third base, and shouted, "Run to third!"
>>
>> As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams were screaming,
>> "Shay, run home!"
>>
>> Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero
>> who hit the "grand slam" and won the game for his team.
>>
>> "That day," said the father softly with tears now rolling down his
>> face, "the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and
>> humanity into this world."
>>
>> AND, NOW A LITTLE FOOTNOTE TO THIS STORY: We all send thousands of
>> jokes through the e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to
>> sending messages about life choices, people think twice about sharing.
>>
>> The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through cyberspace,
>> but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in our
>> schools
>> and workplaces.
>>
>> If you're thinking about forwarding this message, chances are that
>> you're probably sorting out the people on your address list that aren't
>> the
>> "appropriate" ones to receive this type of message.
>>
>> Well, the person who sent you this believes that we all can make a
>> difference. We all have thousands of opportunities every single day to
>> help
>> realize the "natural order of things."
>>
>> So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us
>> with a choice:
>>
>> Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass
>> up that opportunity, and leave the world a little bit colder in the
>> process?

Subject: {pb-cle} Few updates for that utah rave that got busted

I posted a few more videos at http://files.vrillusions.com  Some  
interesting ones, and why I even bothered to mention it here, are the  
videos from the helicopter and interviews with the security team that  
was there.  Really f'ed up.  Also their official site is http:// 
www.music-versus-guns.org/ and there's a media section that has a  
couple other ones.  I still want to copy the discussuion from free  
talk live there since the link is broken now I think, although the  
main site has a mirror to it too.

Subject: {pb-cle} Havana?

Hi. I don't really post here, but I do try to keep up with the  
reading and the inside jokes.

I just moved to Pitt maybe a month or so ago, and have gone to Havana  
a couple of times (barring being stuck at work too late) with  
coworkers, but they have abandoned me as of late.  "We don't like  
that techno stuff," they tell me, and no $2 Yuenglings can sway them  
to return.  Perhaps if the heat and humidity comes back with a force  
they'll return solely for the free air conditioning, but until then  
I'm stuck.  So, besides Jason (the weekly DJ listing for Havana  
thursdays is awesome, by the way), who else attends the Thursday  
weeklies?  I am not above attending events by myself, live music is  
worth it, but I thought I might at least say hello and maybe get a  
couple faces to go with the names.

lemme know,

Benjamin-

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

SPIN featuring Lee Burridge (365, Tyrant, TCA, leeburridge.com)

opening with:
Matt Monroe (SoulGlo, Dynamix Crew)
Philo (Night Vision)

Lee Burridge. The name itself should be enough to turn heads of the most 
stalwart of dance music aficionados. In short: the mad is good - real 
good.

It.s 1985 in the idyllic backwaters of rural England and a young Lee 
Burridge has just embarked on what will become a very colourful DJ 
career. Currently though he.s playing appalling music at birthdays, 
weddings and the odd funeral.

The calibre of Lees early parties ensured that scores of world-class djs 
played, and these sometimes chaotic, often unforgettable nights helped 
lay the foundation for Hong Kong.s now thriving underground house scene.

2 djs who passed through Hong Kong were Sasha and Craig Richards, and 
these guys later fashioned together a partnership called Tyrant. In 1998 
they lured Lee back to the UK, using carrots, to become part of the 
Tyrant Soundsystem.

As Tyrant, Lee and Craig have now released 2 compilations and, luckily 
for them, each has been respected and loved by djs and clubbers alike. 
Listening carefully you.ll hear tracks with a progressive edge, techy 
grooves, deep house and some breaks thrown in for good measure. The 
colossal Pete Tong named the first release his .album of the year.. 
Urban legend has it that, on hearing the news, Lee got drunk on shandy 
to celebrate.

You still want to see more credentials? Europe. Thailand. Hong Kong. 
Australia. The Londoner has headlined the corners of the globe - near 
and far - with a twisted onslaught of house, breaks and techno that will 
leave you bewildered and wondering which country you're in. In fact, if 
you're not careful, he may just end up at your house. Lee is currently 
immersing himself in various cultures around the globe and rubbing 
elbows with the natives. He may just take your musical ideas, give them 
a healthy dose of funk and then stuff them into a compilation for the 
world to witness. Lee's calling this idea 365, becuase that's just the 
type of guy he is. We think it may just be crazy enough to work.

Steve Simpson would like to invite you to yet another evening of 
up-front, forward-thinking tunes. The night just may change the way you 
listen to music.

Sat Oct 08                 MIX 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Cleveland

MIX. ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY w/ HABERSHAM | Abbasso | Cleveland | 
Saturday 10.08.05

HABERSHAM (Blueprint, Global Underground, Audio Therapy)
http://www.blueprintsounds.com

The two minds behind Blueprint Recordings are those of Damon 
Fonooni and Brett Abramson, known in the music industry as 
Habersham and Numinous. Although both come from two very different 
backgrounds, Habersham's roots originating in the UK, and Numinous 
coming out of the early Florida house and progressive scene, they 
both share varied musical influences. These include jazz, classic 
soul and funk, such as Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, Prince, an "Off 
The Wall" Michael Jackson and George Clinton/P-Funk, to Radiohead, 
Nine Inch Nails and early Renaissance house.

Each has been DJing for more than six years and producing original 
music for nearly as long. Together they play varied sounds from 
funky and groovey to deep and headfuck, from techy and tribal to 
melodic and breaky, all of which revolves around their roots in 
house music. Habersham and Numinous' Blueprint club night in 
Atlanta has gained recognition across the globe as being one of 
the only consistent and next-level dance music experiences in the 
Southeastern US, bringing in such groundbreaking artists as Phil 
K, Ashley Casselle, Chris Micali and Ali Ajami.

The music of Blueprint Recordings has already received support 
from Sasha, Sander Kleinenberg, Chris Fortier, Jimmy Van M, Phil 
K, Timo Maas, Martin Villeneuve (MV/Envy), Christopher Lawrence, 
Dave Ralph, Barry Gilbey, Kasey Taylor, Jonathan Ojeda, the 
Scumfrog, Dave Dresden and many, many more. It's house music with 
a subtle funkiness and a deep and dirty edge. The sound of 
Blueprint borrows from classic progressive elements and fuses them 
with quirky sounds of the future, while never losing its ability 
to stimulate the mind and the feet.

No matter the differentiating styles of music you may hear from 
Blueprint, there will always be one constant: pushing minds 
forward and breaking down genre barriers. Conformity:beware.

Doormouse - Miami, FL
Addict, Distort, Planet-Mu, Epileptik, Violent Turd, Schematic, 
Sublight,
CockRockDisco, Zod

Doormouse has been producing some of the most slammingest sick-ass jams 
since 1852. He used a potato and 4 live chickens. Although all masters 
were destroyed by fire, these recordings live on in the hearts and minds 
of the very dead chickens. Now he is the OG Midwest badass and depending 
on which side of the fence you're standing on, Daniel "doormouse" 
Martinstein is either a complete waste of time or a complete waste of 
space. Imagine camping with Dennis Hopper and he roofies you out in the 
woods somewhere and you wake up sewn to a family of badgers. Well he's 
sicker. Take one part Gloria Estefan, one part DJ Paul, one part Guy 
Lombardo and there you have it. Don't worry, we're not sure either. What 
you witness may not be safe.

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight@Havana - SHAWN RUDIMAN - DJ set

THURSDAYS@HAVANA
TONIGHT  09.08.05

[BROTHER MIKE] - 10pm & 1am - The common element of most house music is a 
4/4 beat generated by a drum machine or other electronic means (such as a 
sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically generated) 
bassline. Upon this foundation are added electronically generated sounds and 
samples of music such as jazz, blues and synth pop. House music has been 
sub-divided into a bewildering number of sub-categories, some of which Mike 
will surely play tonight.

[SHAWN RUDIMAN] - 11pm to 1am - Shawn's production style steers clear of any 
standard club' techno format, instead delving deep into the more jazzy, 
melodic, (and sadly oft neglected) side of the genre - his DJ sets hold true 
to this format also.  Don't miss out.

$2 Yuenglings & $3 Mojitos
NO COVER / 21+ / I.D. Required

Thanks to all that helped out and donated to the Hurrican Katrina Relief 
fund.  We here at havana collected $1,300 for the Red Cross and the peeps at 
the Z-lounge collected a whopping $1,600.

Labour of Love was fucking crazy good.  Although, if you're on
Tranceaddict, we might disagree on why...

Atomic Hooligan, Deekline, Evil 9, and Deep Dish tore it the fuck up.=20
Having Blue Man Group perform outside while me and mine were stranded
in line also got some points.  :-)

Anyone know if Guvernment does any other events anywhere close to that?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} hello

Digweed was suprisingly good, and Deep Dish played a much harder,
funkier set than I expected.  The breaks room was *insanely* good all
night; none of the DJ's disappointed, although I got to hear the
Plump's 'Push Up' about three or four times.

The DnB room, as usual, wasn't as good as it could have been... the
MC's kept trying to steal the show without actually having the skills
to do so.

I'll be heading back next year, 1500 miles on the car again and easily
worth it.  :-)

guvernment is always used for bigger events up there, least from the

lineup than the others i've seen.  i really wanted to get to that show 
but my shiturn is .... well a shiturn, and my pocketbook is looking alot 
like a black hole lately....

i will say this about the cannucks up there, they get there early to 
party, and party they do.  so you gotta be there early too or wait in 
line.  we were at an icantstopraving.com party.  seriously seemed like 
everyone was there and in the door by 11:30.  noone else came after 
that.  the crowd was still bumpin at 7-8am, then it thinned out a bit 
after that.  hardcoremotherfuckers.

Yeah, boss at work got a couple of those nano's (going to china next  
week, told him to pick us up windows vista on the streets :) ) and  
they're going to use those for the 13+ hour flight (ugg).  That nano,  
as the great troutdini would say, is TITS!  although I like my 20 gig  
ipod can store a bunch more music.  Although I wouldn't mind getting  
the color one since I still have the 3rd gen without the clickwheel  
and the sucky battery, which I can't get replaced because of some  
exclusion on that battery recall.

Subject: {pb-cle} wolfram tones music generator

http://tones.wolfram.com/

Interesting music generation thing.  Basically it does a whole bunch  
of number crunching and creates a random midi song that sounds quite  
impressive for being generated based on mathematics and whatnot.   
Only thing is make sure you write down the url of the ones you save  
since they are just stored in a cookie and there's no real way of  
getting back to them, or you can just email it, too.  You can also  
create a tone and send it to your cell phone if it supports (and mine  
doesn't, damnit)  Guess just look into how to extract audio from  
webpages.  would be nice if it just exported to a .mid file, too.

scandal, it is no surprise that Boston, a seat of academic, political and  
cultural liberalism in America, lies at the center of the storm." - Rick  
Santorum

"It's important to promote a culture of life." - President George W. Bush

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Havana?

i go as much as i can, which is sadly not enough. maybe once a month if i'm lucky.

i love to go there and hear good house music to offset the damage i do to myself weekly by working at pittsburgh's shabby idea of big dance clubs (80's @ matrix takes its toll) and, as some pgh heads (+ trout) can attest, my calling as a wedding dj!

but it's easily one of the best places to consistently hear quality dance music in pgh. 5 years running and still going strong.

Hi. I don't really post here, but I do try to keep up with the  
reading and the inside jokes.

I just moved to Pitt maybe a month or so ago, and have gone to Havana  
a couple of times (barring being stuck at work too late) with  
coworkers, but they have abandoned me as of late.  "We don't like  
that techno stuff," they tell me, and no $2 Yuenglings can sway them  
to return.  Perhaps if the heat and humidity comes back with a force  
they'll return solely for the free air conditioning, but until then  
I'm stuck.  So, besides Jason (the weekly DJ listing for Havana  
thursdays is awesome, by the way), who else attends the Thursday  
weeklies?  I am not above attending events by myself, live music is  
worth it, but I thought I might at least say hello and maybe get a  
couple faces to go with the names.

lemme know,

Benjamin-

I should have posted a follow up... had an excellent time last week,  
great to meet Jason, Adam, Mike, Anthony (?) and a couple of other  
folks.  As always, the music was great, an oasis to my normal week.   
I'll be going back as often as work/travel will allow.

Thanks again for the replies, hope to maybe meet more of you out there.

that's because tom cox isn't on here anymore, duh.  I know trout has  
no intraweb at the place he moved to yet.  So I guess if anyone has  
an email address that trout hosted for you'uns, that's why you  
haven't been able to get to it.  He's working on getting it to work  
from someone else's house though.

This looks like a nice party, things seem to be
looking pretty good over in Ohio (Although i kind of
frown upon the ten children in cages)...anyhow

Cant wait to go to this party, right after whistle
too!!

My girl will hopefully dress up as something really
slutty for halloween

Should be good times, anyone else excited?

Though it's pretty good for Ohio. It's good that you have a positive outloo=

on Ohio. As for me I think it's really weak. We have way too many little cr=

baby emo fucks running around to have a good rave scene.

  I'm going to this party. It should be ok. But the line up is just good =
enough to get by.=20

many little cry baby emo fucks running around to have a good rave scene.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Plate Tectonics Presents TechMix featuring:

a night of innovative techno, from minimal to stomping, and possibly 
even some drum and bass thrown in for good measure (she played some live 
at Fuse:in).

Fri Sep 30                          SPIN                         Pittsburgh

SPIN featuring Lee Burridge (365, Tyrant, TCA, leeburridge.com)

opening with:
Matt Monroe (SoulGlo, Dynamix Crew)
Philo (Night Vision)

Lee Burridge. The name itself should be enough to turn heads of the most 
stalwart of dance music aficionados. In short: the mad is good - real 
good.

It.s 1985 in the idyllic backwaters of rural England and a young Lee 
Burridge has just embarked on what will become a very colourful DJ 
career. Currently though he.s playing appalling music at birthdays, 
weddings and the odd funeral.

The calibre of Lees early parties ensured that scores of world-class djs 
played, and these sometimes chaotic, often unforgettable nights helped 
lay the foundation for Hong Kong.s now thriving underground house scene.

2 djs who passed through Hong Kong were Sasha and Craig Richards, and 
these guys later fashioned together a partnership called Tyrant. In 1998 
they lured Lee back to the UK, using carrots, to become part of the 
Tyrant Soundsystem.

As Tyrant, Lee and Craig have now released 2 compilations and, luckily 
for them, each has been respected and loved by djs and clubbers alike. 
Listening carefully you.ll hear tracks with a progressive edge, techy 
grooves, deep house and some breaks thrown in for good measure. The 
colossal Pete Tong named the first release his .album of the year.. 
Urban legend has it that, on hearing the news, Lee got drunk on shandy 
to celebrate.

You still want to see more credentials? Europe. Thailand. Hong Kong. 
Australia. The Londoner has headlined the corners of the globe - near 
and far - with a twisted onslaught of house, breaks and techno that will 
leave you bewildered and wondering which country you're in. In fact, if 
you're not careful, he may just end up at your house. Lee is currently 
immersing himself in various cultures around the globe and rubbing 
elbows with the natives. He may just take your musical ideas, give them 
a healthy dose of funk and then stuff them into a compilation for the 
world to witness. Lee's calling this idea 365, becuase that's just the 
type of guy he is. We think it may just be crazy enough to work.

Steve Simpson would like to invite you to yet another evening of 
up-front, forward-thinking tunes. The night just may change the way you 
listen to music.

Sat Oct 08                 MIX 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Cleveland

MIX. ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY w/ HABERSHAM | Abbasso | Cleveland | 
Saturday 10.08.05

HABERSHAM (Blueprint, Global Underground, Audio Therapy)
http://www.blueprintsounds.com

The two minds behind Blueprint Recordings are those of Damon 
Fonooni and Brett Abramson, known in the music industry as 
Habersham and Numinous. Although both come from two very different 
backgrounds, Habersham's roots originating in the UK, and Numinous 
coming out of the early Florida house and progressive scene, they 
both share varied musical influences. These include jazz, classic 
soul and funk, such as Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, Prince, an "Off 
The Wall" Michael Jackson and George Clinton/P-Funk, to Radiohead, 
Nine Inch Nails and early Renaissance house.

Each has been DJing for more than six years and producing original 
music for nearly as long. Together they play varied sounds from 
funky and groovey to deep and headfuck, from techy and tribal to 
melodic and breaky, all of which revolves around their roots in 
house music. Habersham and Numinous' Blueprint club night in 
Atlanta has gained recognition across the globe as being one of 
the only consistent and next-level dance music experiences in the 
Southeastern US, bringing in such groundbreaking artists as Phil 
K, Ashley Casselle, Chris Micali and Ali Ajami.

The music of Blueprint Recordings has already received support 
from Sasha, Sander Kleinenberg, Chris Fortier, Jimmy Van M, Phil 
K, Timo Maas, Martin Villeneuve (MV/Envy), Christopher Lawrence, 
Dave Ralph, Barry Gilbey, Kasey Taylor, Jonathan Ojeda, the 
Scumfrog, Dave Dresden and many, many more. It's house music with 
a subtle funkiness and a deep and dirty edge. The sound of 
Blueprint borrows from classic progressive elements and fuses them 
with quirky sounds of the future, while never losing its ability 
to stimulate the mind and the feet.

No matter the differentiating styles of music you may hear from 
Blueprint, there will always be one constant: pushing minds 
forward and breaking down genre barriers. Conformity:beware.

Doormouse - Miami, FL
Addict, Distort, Planet-Mu, Epileptik, Violent Turd, Schematic, 
Sublight,
CockRockDisco, Zod

Doormouse has been producing some of the most slammingest sick-ass jams 
since 1852. He used a potato and 4 live chickens. Although all masters 
were destroyed by fire, these recordings live on in the hearts and minds 
of the very dead chickens. Now he is the OG Midwest badass and depending 
on which side of the fence you're standing on, Daniel "doormouse" 
Martinstein is either a complete waste of time or a complete waste of 
space. Imagine camping with Dennis Hopper and he roofies you out in the 
woods somewhere and you wake up sewn to a family of badgers. Well he's 
sicker. Take one part Gloria Estefan, one part DJ Paul, one part Guy 
Lombardo and there you have it. Don't worry, we're not sure either. What 
you witness may not be safe.

Fri Nov 04                        D-BRIDGE                        Cleveland

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

Yeah, i don't get emo.  I was in Coventry a few weeks ago hangin out 
with Stef and eating some sandwiches from cosmic daves out on the 
sidewalk.  There must have been some emo band playing because there were 
these strangely dressed kids everywhere.  I assume it's what emo is.  I 
don't know if I've ever saw an emo person before so I guess I can be 
sure.  All the guys were wearing super tights girls pants.  It didn't 
look good at all.

Chris Liberator was absolutely incredible at WEMF last year.  One of the 
only 2 sets that I really enjoyed there.

And to think just a few years ago people thought ravers were  
strangely dressed kids but that's right, no one gets candied out

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight@Havana - TONY aka DJ MAXIMUS from the BRONX

THURSDAYS@HAVANA
TONIGHT  09.15.05

[BROTHER MIKE] - 10pm & 1am - Deep Soulful House Music.

[TONY] - 11pm to 1am - This may well be Tony's last time playing at Club 
Havana before he moves out West.  You might know him as our former resident 
on Saturday Night where he had to mix it up for the crowd playing some Hip 
Hop, Party Jams, Top 40 and a little bit o' House ... well tonight it is 
striclty House Music  ... all night long.

$2 Yuenglings & $3 Mojitos
NO COVER / 21+ / I.D. Required
Back Patio Open


My Pick for the Weekend:

Pour Me Another Tour: Atmosphere with guests Blueprint and P.O.S.
Slug and producer Ant make up Atmosphere. Due to years of touring and Slug's 
personal lyrical style Atmosphere has become legends in the underground Hip 
Hop scene and beyond. With a massive following of not only die-hard Hip Hop 
heads but indie rockers, punks, and not to mention one of Hip Hop's largest 
female followings, Atmosphere is breaking down barriers and expanding the 
definition of what Hip Hop can be in this day and age.

Hmm..might I do a roll call.  (this is my birthday party too, and I am most excited.)  
 
Saturday, Sept. 17th At Abbasso: 

Plate Tectonics Presents TechMix featuring: 



Punisher (Seismic Records, Detroit)
Andy James (Berettamusic.com, Digital Goodtime, Koala-Tea) 
Mark Strauss (Plate Tectonics) 
Damon Havill and Jamie Tyler (Plate Tectonics) 



We've been wanting to bring Michelle "Punisher" Herrmann in for quite a while, and after hearing her set at Fuse-In decided we needed to make it happen. Michelle will be gracing us with a live PA/DJ hybrid performance. More info and mixes will follow in the coming weeks. Expect a night of innovative techno, from minimal to stomping, and possibly even some drum and bass thrown in for good measure (she played some live at Fuse:in). 

$5 before 2am, $10 after. 

21+ 

10pm - 5am (yeah we're doing afterhours for this one)

i was inspired by your oldies set at goose and christina's wedding, so i
wrapped my set up last night with some roy orbison.  no, that's a lie. 
bill stuck it in my record bag before going to annabells to spin, i guess
it was something he needed to hear?

oh yeah, they're open again, it was closed for one week for "remodelling".
 actually a few of us were confused by the cleanliness last night!!!
(comparatively speaking)...  so don't be afraid to come out.

<<i was inspired by your oldies set at goose and christina's wedding,
so i  wrapped my set up last night with some roy orbison.>>

word. thanks.=20

roy is good. in college, someone found a disc that was the soundtrack
to a movie he was in called "the fastest guitar in the west".

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0178436/

i'm sure it was one of those "let's capitalize on the 'music star in a
movie' a la elvis or the rat pack" type things. but a couple of the
songs ranked pretty high on the 'kitsch as cool' meter.

"pistolero" and "good time party" were highlights. if you can hunt it
down, pick it up.

I remember when Roy Orbison played at the Boar's Nest in the Dukes of Hazzard tv show.
He played "Pretty Woman" to Daisy.....what a pimp.

EXP023 - GRASSHOPPA - LOST IN GRAY MATTER EP

>From the second you hit play, you know it's on. This EP is a 37 minute
no-holds-barred attack on your eardrums. The beats are relentless in
their insistence, and the melodies and pads are about as overflowing
and volcanic as you could imagine. Simply put, this is expressionist
drill 'n' bass. the songs are extremely glitchy and fast-paced, yet
hang in the air like a haze around your sphere of perception. Thin,
bell-like chiming and strumming floats on a thick rockbase of
orgy-like percussion. "Drown In Lena River" takes you on a ride
through a funhouse of contrasting organic plant-life, while "owiiFF"
seems to struggle just to maintain its own static form. The pieces
come off, ultimately, as having a natural child-like wonder, and an
awe and a playfulness that other artist struggle to pretentiously
invent in their music.

You know, I just saw Woody, Terry, and Hyperactive play on this system two weekends ago in Denver.
The system was an impressive sight.  I counted 30 x 2000 watt Crown amps.
They had a team of sound guys set-it up, and it runs on its own generator.
I have some pics of the set-up I try to post tomorrow.
 
However...the sound was very muddy, no mids or hi's came through.
 
I'm glad that I got experience it, it made the hair on my arms stand up...no joke.
But for a multiple hour dance session, it was too much....and this was the general consensus.
 
I think it would work better in an area with no walls (huge arena, or outdoors), but in a venue that hold 1500-2000, its a wash of sound.

<DIV>You know, I just saw Woody, Terry, and Hyperactive&nbsp;play on this system two weekends ago in Denver.</DIV>
<DIV>The system was&nbsp;an&nbsp;impressive sight.&nbsp; I counted 30 x 2000 watt Crown amps.</DIV>
<DIV>They had a team of sound guys set-it up, and it runs on its own generator.</DIV>
<DIV>I have some pics of the set-up I try to post tomorrow.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>However...the sound was very muddy, no mids or hi's came through.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I'm glad that I got experience it, it made the hair on my arms stand up...no joke.</DIV>
<DIV>But for a multiple hour dance session, it was too much....and this was the general consensus.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I think it would work better in an area with no walls (huge arena, or outdoors), but in a venue that hold 1500-2000, its a wash of sound.</DIV>

<<just further proof that most music that has electric guitars
involved in it sucks balls>>

substitute "guitars" with "synthesizers", and in 1991, people were
saying this same thing  of electronic music.

oh, and i've heard the technoir audio guys work some electric guitar
into their live pa's and it pretty much rocked shit.

don't front on the instrument. front on the poser ass attitude.

Subject: {pb-cle} exp024 - Hydroplane - Hydroplane LP

exp024 - Hydroplane - Hydroplane LP

Words like abstract, absurd and weird are used everyday to describe
the unknown or unusual. Hydroplane's debut LP for Experimedia is all
of those things and more. Shuffling, gurgling beats spiral around
skeletal arpeggios and awkwardly sliced samples, creating a demented
taffy-like effect over the albums 11 tracks. Pieces like "Argag"
create such an air through the lunatic repetition of voices and
playful mallet sounds, that the listener often feels as though some
powerful psychadelic drug has been slipped to them unknowingly
approximately 20-40 minutes ago. By the time "Morguray" drops, you've
had sufficient time to pour yourself a cold beverage and rub ice on
your confused brain, as you watch the sunset from a deckchair on a
white beach. Finally, the LP's closer, "Outro", ultimately leaves the
listener feeling drained and yet oddly fulfilled... ready for whatever
comes next.

<<Good things happening at Abbasso these days!>>

I gotta say that surprises me a bit... it just seemed
like that place was on serious life support a couple
of years ago and was about to perish. Good to see
there is still at least a small scene up there and
some of you are still hangin' on. 

There is absolutely NO place to go down here to listen
to any quality dance music at all. Nothing. Nada.
Ricks on Duval St. is the only place to even hear any
edm and it is total CHEESE(Amazing hotties tho!!!).In
fact you really gotta sniff good live music out on
this friggin island as it is hopelessly buried under a
pile of HORRIBLE cover bands endlessly playing
'Margaritaville'. 

Really miss some of you guys and REALLY REALLY miss
what we had 5-6 yrs. ago. Peace.

I'm intending to go.  haven't made any specific plans though.  the 
hardcore stage alone is reason enough for me to go.  Human resource, 
Live?!!  holy shit eh? Scott brown, Nostrum...

I've seen Chris liberator so many times... he does please though, 
unless he brings those shitty housey records like he did back in 2002 
at WEMF.. or was it 2001.. who can remember.

Commander tom is sometimes good, sometimes bad, so I've learned not 
to expect much out of him.

oh wait, I should stop, I sound like trout.

I can barely tell what you are trying to say half the time but I think
I was able to decode this one.

Anyways...the point wasnt wether he has been using the name since he
was 10/11.  Honestly I dont even know how long he has been using the
name.

The point was....what if he had been using the name that long.  Who is
to say they have the rights to a name.  Do you think some guy in Wales
is going to know there is some guy in Cleveland playing some records
at some house parties and working on some tracks in his bedroom as
Grasshoppa.

You wouldnt have even heard of it yourself if it wasnt for the fact
that the Grasshoppa from Wales happened to release an album on a label
based in Ohio whos owner happens to be subscribed to the pb-cle list.

FYI... The artist has requested to have his name changed to
Grasshopper because he does not want to share his performer alias with
an illiterate two-bit dj.

Thanks Mark,

What aspects of the mix lost those other 3 points?  What's a mix you 
would consider a 9 or 10?

If it wasnt your intention to come off like a pretentious ass then you
shouldnt have jumped off the bat threatening legal action.  Which just
so you know...a lawyer would just laugh at you if you came to him with
your supposed case.  Do some searching on discogs.com and you will see
that many people share the same monikers in the world of
underground/indpendant music.  Anyways...im done with this.  Best of
luck to you.

Here's an idea...people going by their "real" names.  Just an idea for any current wannabe DJ's thinking about their monikers to be that might prevent potential issues.  ;P

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} BSP: Summer 2005 Drum and Bass Mix: Ladies & Gentlemen

1) I'm not a huge dnb head, so it wasn't anything about the mix that
was "wrong". I don't know that any dnb mix I ever listened to would
rank a 10...except in my younger, more inexperienced days. I remember
a DJ Moose set of hip-hop and rnb bootlegs ("Putting Things Together")
that didn't leave my discman for about 3 months. That might be the
only one that I would ever rank as a 10...but that was way back in 99
or 00...

2) Don't take the "7" thing as a reflection on you, or as a bad thing
in any way. Considering I have a low tolerance for MOST drum n bass
these days, the fact that I made it all the way through (let alone
played on repeat most of the day) is, in my mind, validation that it's
a good mix. It was funky, soulful and well assembled. I have about
zero patience for most of the "super hard banging" stuff out now.

3) The last dnb mix i remember that was on my "regular rotation" was
one of Ratana's mixes from '03. It's been a while. I'm not some sort
of "tastemaker" or anything. I'm fairly picky as far as what gets more
than one listen, but I like it when people share mixes from Pb-Cle
Land...and I try to be supportive of them.

Keep up the good work!

Vodka and redbull at Moda, Cloud 9, and probably a couple other places

Vodka and redbull in most of the big cities is $10 for a larger glass,

Half-glass in the trendy spots. =20

Subject: {pb-cle} Pandora.com

Not sure if this has passed through the list yet, but I just recently  
ran into it:

pandora.com

It's a streaming music service that automatically tries to find  
related and other artists to whatever you punch in at first.  If  
anything, it's at least free to try, pretty decent for digging up  
related but unheard of tracks.  Dunno how long it has been around for.

I personally don't play halo 2,

I have friends that do.

It's always relaxing to go out and see them play and get all pissed off.

I'll just sit there all nice and comfy on a cloud.

I bet a MILLION dollars tom cox sounds like those guys.

Where is that fucker.

Ehhhh,

He was kinda losin it in old age anyway....




(I'm actually tryin to elbow the fucker back on this godforsaken list, no

synopsis:

Julian and the few friends who managed to escape from Necropolis are all now in college and putting their Hybratech experiences behind them. But that doesnt last as accidentally Julian and Jenny discover a sinister chemical canister hidden away in a secret room. Trying to dissect this chemical, labeled as Trioxyin-5, they leave it with their friend Cody for analysis. Unfortunately, Cody quickly sees the potential to create a new party drug out of it and make himself some easy money. He lies to Julian and produces a huge batch of Z that he sells across the college campus.

As the drug becomes more and more popular and Halloween approaches, practically everyone in the college has taken a little Z. As hundreds of innocent college students become brain hungry zombies, holiday costumes make it difficult to tell who is still alive and who is one of the living dead! 

As the rave party begins, the zombies start to take over till its uncertain if anyone will escape this rave to the grave!

I don't get the Joe Biden crossover reference.

Biden is a Democrat who authored the 2nd RAVE act, the one that actually
passed.

He's also probably a presidential candidate for 2008.

Hey, finally someone Tom can get behind!

This is true, but mister entropy has his own story to tell about him. He is
a Republicant.

Subject: {pb-cle} drum and bass mix (some one link me to one)

Can someone link me to a drum and bass mix to listen to while here at
work.  But hold on...I am looking for something in particular.

I am currently focusing my studio studies on drum programming and am
trying to study closely and get experience in programming and sound
designing kits for all the standard genres.

Drum and bass, although I have skimmed the genre and follow some of
the more experimental drum and bass I really dont have much knowledge
of or own any standard drum and bass tracks as far as dark or techy or
sci-fi type stuff goes.

So I am looking for a drum and bass mix that has really good examples
of excellent drum programming as far as your standard drum and bass
goes.  (Not ragga btw...have heard my share of that).  Not really
atmoshperic stuff either.  Stuff thats really focused on rhythm and
groove.

Any help would be much appreciated.  I am close to my bandwidth cap at
work so if someone can be particlar with their suggestion...I can
really only download one.

Thanks,
Jeremy

Also...preferably not too overly compressed...192 would do but even
higher would be nice.  I need to be able to hear the transients
semi-clearly.
Thanks.

You're still a mean grumpy jaded old fuck, just a mean grumpy old  
fuck that has a good time in toronto (who doesn't?) although I still  
have my "poker face" and kinda dissappointed in that, so no pictures  
of me, but they're at:

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Sep 30                          SPIN                         Pittsburgh

SPIN featuring Lee Burridge (365, Tyrant, TCA, leeburridge.com)

opening with:
Matt Monroe (SoulGlo, Dynamix Crew)
Philo (Night Vision)

Lee Burridge. The name itself should be enough to turn heads of the most 
stalwart of dance music aficionados. In short: the mad is good - real 
good.

It.s 1985 in the idyllic backwaters of rural England and a young Lee 
Burridge has just embarked on what will become a very colourful DJ 
career. Currently though he.s playing appalling music at birthdays, 
weddings and the odd funeral.

The calibre of Lees early parties ensured that scores of world-class djs 
played, and these sometimes chaotic, often unforgettable nights helped 
lay the foundation for Hong Kong.s now thriving underground house scene.

2 djs who passed through Hong Kong were Sasha and Craig Richards, and 
these guys later fashioned together a partnership called Tyrant. In 1998 
they lured Lee back to the UK, using carrots, to become part of the 
Tyrant Soundsystem.

As Tyrant, Lee and Craig have now released 2 compilations and, luckily 
for them, each has been respected and loved by djs and clubbers alike. 
Listening carefully you.ll hear tracks with a progressive edge, techy 
grooves, deep house and some breaks thrown in for good measure. The 
colossal Pete Tong named the first release his .album of the year.. 
Urban legend has it that, on hearing the news, Lee got drunk on shandy 
to celebrate.

You still want to see more credentials? Europe. Thailand. Hong Kong. 
Australia. The Londoner has headlined the corners of the globe - near 
and far - with a twisted onslaught of house, breaks and techno that will 
leave you bewildered and wondering which country you're in. In fact, if 
you're not careful, he may just end up at your house. Lee is currently 
immersing himself in various cultures around the globe and rubbing 
elbows with the natives. He may just take your musical ideas, give them 
a healthy dose of funk and then stuff them into a compilation for the 
world to witness. Lee's calling this idea 365, becuase that's just the 
type of guy he is. We think it may just be crazy enough to work.

Steve Simpson would like to invite you to yet another evening of 
up-front, forward-thinking tunes. The night just may change the way you 
listen to music.

Sat Oct 08                 MIX 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Cleveland

MIX. ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY w/ HABERSHAM | Abbasso | Cleveland | 
Saturday 10.08.05

HABERSHAM (Blueprint, Global Underground, Audio Therapy)
http://www.blueprintsounds.com

The two minds behind Blueprint Recordings are those of Damon 
Fonooni and Brett Abramson, known in the music industry as 
Habersham and Numinous. Although both come from two very different 
backgrounds, Habersham's roots originating in the UK, and Numinous 
coming out of the early Florida house and progressive scene, they 
both share varied musical influences. These include jazz, classic 
soul and funk, such as Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, Prince, an "Off 
The Wall" Michael Jackson and George Clinton/P-Funk, to Radiohead, 
Nine Inch Nails and early Renaissance house.

Each has been DJing for more than six years and producing original 
music for nearly as long. Together they play varied sounds from 
funky and groovey to deep and headfuck, from techy and tribal to 
melodic and breaky, all of which revolves around their roots in 
house music. Habersham and Numinous' Blueprint club night in 
Atlanta has gained recognition across the globe as being one of 
the only consistent and next-level dance music experiences in the 
Southeastern US, bringing in such groundbreaking artists as Phil 
K, Ashley Casselle, Chris Micali and Ali Ajami.

The music of Blueprint Recordings has already received support 
from Sasha, Sander Kleinenberg, Chris Fortier, Jimmy Van M, Phil 
K, Timo Maas, Martin Villeneuve (MV/Envy), Christopher Lawrence, 
Dave Ralph, Barry Gilbey, Kasey Taylor, Jonathan Ojeda, the 
Scumfrog, Dave Dresden and many, many more. It's house music with 
a subtle funkiness and a deep and dirty edge. The sound of 
Blueprint borrows from classic progressive elements and fuses them 
with quirky sounds of the future, while never losing its ability 
to stimulate the mind and the feet.

No matter the differentiating styles of music you may hear from 
Blueprint, there will always be one constant: pushing minds 
forward and breaking down genre barriers. Conformity:beware.

Doormouse - Miami, FL
Addict, Distort, Planet-Mu, Epileptik, Violent Turd, Schematic, 
Sublight,
CockRockDisco, Zod

Doormouse has been producing some of the most slammingest sick-ass jams 
since 1852. He used a potato and 4 live chickens. Although all masters 
were destroyed by fire, these recordings live on in the hearts and minds 
of the very dead chickens. Now he is the OG Midwest badass and depending 
on which side of the fence you're standing on, Daniel "doormouse" 
Martinstein is either a complete waste of time or a complete waste of 
space. Imagine camping with Dennis Hopper and he roofies you out in the 
woods somewhere and you wake up sewn to a family of badgers. Well he's 
sicker. Take one part Gloria Estefan, one part DJ Paul, one part Guy 
Lombardo and there you have it. Don't worry, we're not sure either. What 
you witness may not be safe.

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

This has been posted on a few boards w/ lots of traffic so bandwidth probably isn't an issue... anyone who digs acid should check it out :) 
 
also, for those wanting to buy these tracks on vinyl: use the tracklisting in coordinance w/ the releases available at Boomkat:

Looks like abbasso may have a future, yet.

It's all good. We had a blast at Abbasso, the tunes were
pumpin. This monthly is still a new concept, so it's going
to take a while to build it up. It's important for promoters
to build their own crowd and I think with time this
psy-trance sound will catch on in Cleveland.
It was good to see our fellow plate tectitions keeping
the techno vibe going accross town. We switched
dates with them for next month. The next psy-tektonics
is Saturday 10-15.

Lineup:
Malachi
Meghan
Moke

http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clive.hocker/moroder/mor_1978/part01.htm

"We are always trying very hard to improve the overall quality of our
work, while Kraftwerk are still holding on to the older ways of
recording. If I were to record another synthesiser album right now, I
wouldn't do it at all like 'I Feel Love'. That sound is out of date
and use."

Great article.

Giorgio is a bit out of touch.  Kraftwerk really never was a disco band. 
They're a rock band.

"We are always trying very hard to improve the overall quality of our
work, while Kraftwerk are still holding on to the older ways of
recording. If I were to record another synthesiser album right now, I
wouldn't do it at all like 'I Feel Love'. That sound is out of date

Great article.

ROCK band?  That's a bit a stretch.  Hell, I'd barely call them a BAND.   
They're a bunch of fuckin geeks that play with toys and sing about  
computers.  Woop-di-doo.


Of course, this "Giorgio" guy is probably still making 90s music on  
hardware, so him calling out people for using "older ways" of making music  
is laughable..

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: moroder called kraftwerk "sell outs"??

I lived through this period.  "Dehumaizing disco", think "I Feel Love". 
Poppycock, cocaine dehumanized disco.  :-)

Giorgio and Kraftwerk were not playing the same genre of music.  Kraftwerk 
would go for the rock charts, Giorgio was dance music.  Most Kraftwerk tunes 
were not dancable, which is a requirement for a disco track.

<<I lived through this period.  "Dehumaizing disco", think "I Feel
Love". Poppycock, cocaine dehumanized disco.  :-)>>

I think, in his really bad English-speaking way, that's what he was
trying to say in the article...that he was trying to make the
electronic music have more soul and elicit more emotion with each
production he did, while Kraftwerk were focused more on the mechanical
aspect.

I don't necessarily subscribe to either theory as being 100%
correct...I think Trans-Europe Express is funky in its own way. But I
think "I Feel Love" is a classic as well. It's kind of like comparing
apples and oranges, really.

You may be using the same tools, but that doesn't mean you're building
the same thing as the next guy.

I highly recommend:

Barr, Tim. "Kraftwerk": From Dusseldorf to the Future (with Love). 
Ebury Press 1998
ISBN 0091864909

If you read this book, you'll find out that Kraftwerk is a pop band, 
not a rock band.

You'll also learn that Radioactivity was originally not about 
radiation but about radio stations and Kraftwerk's amazement and the 
variety of American radio.

It has the most first person text on Kraftwerk I've read...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} (another) Analord mix

i'm surprised at myself, but i actually like the faster b-side mix more.

i would've bet dollars to donuts before listening that i'd have liked
the slower mix better.

maybe there's still some raver left in me after all.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Daniel Brown
(Akron)N-Phrase
Daniel Brown, not to much to say about this guy, except that his love 
for dancemusic reaches the Heaven's. He strives to bring the best tracks 
he can find to the decks. Not sure what you will find in his dj'ing 
sets. He is always trying to push his music to new heights. You can find 
house and progressive through the night.
He just moved to the Akron,Oh area from Louisville,Ky. He has played at 
a couple of raves held at Expo 5 in Louisville,Ky and went on to become 
head dj at The Endzone with best Friend Justin Zegart. Not happy how 
things where heading he then decided to move to Akron,Oh to see where he 
can take his music.This is just the beginning

Spencer Todd
(Akron/NYC)
Alot of you never heard of him,but he has a huge underground reputation 
across the United States.Inspired by Junior Vasquez,Spencer Todd bought 
his first set of turntables and records at age 15 in 1990.He started out 
doing outlaws,raves and various NYC clubs.
After a long hiatus away from the scene and moving to Ohio,Spencer is 
now Resident Dj at R/E Nightclub.

Fri Sep 30                          SPIN                         Pittsburgh

SPIN featuring Lee Burridge (365, Tyrant, TCA, leeburridge.com)

opening with:
Matt Monroe (SoulGlo, Dynamix Crew)
Philo (Night Vision)

Lee Burridge. The name itself should be enough to turn heads of the most 
stalwart of dance music aficionados. In short: the mad is good - real 
good.

It.s 1985 in the idyllic backwaters of rural England and a young Lee 
Burridge has just embarked on what will become a very colourful DJ 
career. Currently though he.s playing appalling music at birthdays, 
weddings and the odd funeral.

The calibre of Lees early parties ensured that scores of world-class djs 
played, and these sometimes chaotic, often unforgettable nights helped 
lay the foundation for Hong Kong.s now thriving underground house scene.

2 djs who passed through Hong Kong were Sasha and Craig Richards, and 
these guys later fashioned together a partnership called Tyrant. In 1998 
they lured Lee back to the UK, using carrots, to become part of the 
Tyrant Soundsystem.

As Tyrant, Lee and Craig have now released 2 compilations and, luckily 
for them, each has been respected and loved by djs and clubbers alike. 
Listening carefully you.ll hear tracks with a progressive edge, techy 
grooves, deep house and some breaks thrown in for good measure. The 
colossal Pete Tong named the first release his .album of the year.. 
Urban legend has it that, on hearing the news, Lee got drunk on shandy 
to celebrate.

You still want to see more credentials? Europe. Thailand. Hong Kong. 
Australia. The Londoner has headlined the corners of the globe - near 
and far - with a twisted onslaught of house, breaks and techno that will 
leave you bewildered and wondering which country you're in. In fact, if 
you're not careful, he may just end up at your house. Lee is currently 
immersing himself in various cultures around the globe and rubbing 
elbows with the natives. He may just take your musical ideas, give them 
a healthy dose of funk and then stuff them into a compilation for the 
world to witness. Lee's calling this idea 365, becuase that's just the 
type of guy he is. We think it may just be crazy enough to work.

Steve Simpson would like to invite you to yet another evening of 
up-front, forward-thinking tunes. The night just may change the way you 
listen to music.

THE 15TH ANNUAL DR. JOHN CAREY MEMORIAL AIDS WALK presented by the Plain 
Dealer.

This annual event is thrown to raise money to support AIDS-related 
services and research. Individuals interested in helping out are asked 
to "pledge" a certain amount of money, either personally or through 
sponsors, and participate in a walk around the University Circle area. 
The way it works is that you are asked to collect donation money to be 
given prior to or on the day of the walk. Come down to the Wade Oval to 
register, and join the masses for a fun walk around the beautiful 
University Circle area. Registration begins at 8:00am. The walk begins 
at 10:00am. Registration forms are available at the link below.

I (bac) and Suburban will be DJing from 8:00am until the early afternoon 
at the Wade Oval stage. We will be playing a mix of fun and groovy Drum 
and Bass as well as other more mainstream family-friendly music. Don't 
be surprised if you catch some Arrested Development, Beatles, or any 
other random fun and inspiring music. For once, requests may be taken! 
The Wade Oval is located near the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

For more information about the walk, or to participate, please visit:

http://www.cleveland.com/AIDSwalk/

Also, feel free to contact me if you have any other questions.

This is another great opportunity for the EDM community to come out and 
show some love and support for an important cause. I highly encourage 
people to get the word out about this event and if you can, participate. 
It will be fun and you will be helping to fight one of modern 
civilization's greatest medical epidemics.

Sat Oct 08                 MIX 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Cleveland

MIX. ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY w/ HABERSHAM | Abbasso | Cleveland | 
Saturday 10.08.05

HABERSHAM (Blueprint, Global Underground, Audio Therapy)
http://www.blueprintsounds.com

The two minds behind Blueprint Recordings are those of Damon 
Fonooni and Brett Abramson, known in the music industry as 
Habersham and Numinous. Although both come from two very different 
backgrounds, Habersham's roots originating in the UK, and Numinous 
coming out of the early Florida house and progressive scene, they 
both share varied musical influences. These include jazz, classic 
soul and funk, such as Miles Davis, Marvin Gaye, Prince, an "Off 
The Wall" Michael Jackson and George Clinton/P-Funk, to Radiohead, 
Nine Inch Nails and early Renaissance house.

Each has been DJing for more than six years and producing original 
music for nearly as long. Together they play varied sounds from 
funky and groovey to deep and headfuck, from techy and tribal to 
melodic and breaky, all of which revolves around their roots in 
house music. Habersham and Numinous' Blueprint club night in 
Atlanta has gained recognition across the globe as being one of 
the only consistent and next-level dance music experiences in the 
Southeastern US, bringing in such groundbreaking artists as Phil 
K, Ashley Casselle, Chris Micali and Ali Ajami.

The music of Blueprint Recordings has already received support 
from Sasha, Sander Kleinenberg, Chris Fortier, Jimmy Van M, Phil 
K, Timo Maas, Martin Villeneuve (MV/Envy), Christopher Lawrence, 
Dave Ralph, Barry Gilbey, Kasey Taylor, Jonathan Ojeda, the 
Scumfrog, Dave Dresden and many, many more. It's house music with 
a subtle funkiness and a deep and dirty edge. The sound of 
Blueprint borrows from classic progressive elements and fuses them 
with quirky sounds of the future, while never losing its ability 
to stimulate the mind and the feet.

No matter the differentiating styles of music you may hear from 
Blueprint, there will always be one constant: pushing minds 
forward and breaking down genre barriers. Conformity:beware.

/ / / / / / / / MUSICAN INFO

TOK TOK 'LIVE PA' [ BERLIN / GERMANY . TOK TOK REC. ]
Founded in 1994 in Europe's techno capital, TokTok creates original
soundscapes, expanding modern style boundaries.  TokTok is renowned
for their 'live performances', which entailed bringing the studio,
synthesizers, drumcomputers, effects, and an enormous mixing console,
to the party.  Innumerable performances and 23 record releases later,
their evolved sound is dedicated to making you dance.

MICHA KLANG [ NRNBERG / GERMANY . PASO MUSIC . MOTHERSHIP ]
Micha Klang's style is marked by a love for long sets of minimal,
textured tech-house and crunchy, crispy techno beats.  Originating in
Nrnberg in the late '90s, Micha Klang quickly broke ground with his
'Mothership' event.  'Summership', an open air event in an old castle
was attended by thousands. 'Mothership' recently celebrated its 6th
Anniversary, headlining Sven Vath, and today Micha Klang runs his
label 'Paso Music' with Spallek, Sebrok, and Marc Miroir.

JUSTIN SCHUMACHER [ NYC . SATELLITE RECORDS ]
This young emerging dj/producer from the land of crooks is steadily
gaining local praise for his ass-shaking, thought provoking sets. His
style ranges from deep and mental, to dancefloor phunk, to straight
dark bangin madness. There is no monotony, just an evolving journey
through this elaborate music we call techno.

MIKO [ PHILADELPHIA . f(x) ]
In 1993 Miko brought his blend of funky house and disco to The Freight
Yard and established himself as a resident deejay there.  This club
was located in a warehouse in Allentown, PA and is known for the
legendary all night events and weeklies that took place when the rave
scene was starting up in the US. At a time when techno music was the
standard, Miko defied the norm by giving the crowd an awesome house
set while at the same time keeping interest through a unique energy of
driving techno sounds.

VEX [ PHILADELPHIA . f(x) ]
With a mysterious past, ranging from former KGB agent to founding
father of the Illuminati, not much is known about Vex. He shows up,
does as asked, and makes a prompt exit while leaving no traces, aside
from the occasional person seeking the name of a track he played.
People who know his true identity describe him as "A tall, short,
white black fat skinny man with blue black green short long hair, and
brown blue eyes. Oh, and he's really into Toblerone"

Doormouse - Miami, FL
Addict, Distort, Planet-Mu, Epileptik, Violent Turd, Schematic, 
Sublight,
CockRockDisco, Zod

Doormouse has been producing some of the most slammingest sick-ass jams 
since 1852. He used a potato and 4 live chickens. Although all masters 
were destroyed by fire, these recordings live on in the hearts and minds 
of the very dead chickens. Now he is the OG Midwest badass and depending 
on which side of the fence you're standing on, Daniel "doormouse" 
Martinstein is either a complete waste of time or a complete waste of 
space. Imagine camping with Dennis Hopper and he roofies you out in the 
woods somewhere and you wake up sewn to a family of badgers. Well he's 
sicker. Take one part Gloria Estefan, one part DJ Paul, one part Guy 
Lombardo and there you have it. Don't worry, we're not sure either. What 
you witness may not be safe.

Fri Nov 04                        D-BRIDGE                        Cleveland

friday november 4th @ mercury lounge:

D-Bridge (exit / bad company / London UK)

============================================
D-Bridge AKA Darren White's first introduction into the music scene was 
in 1992, when he formed 'Sewage Monsters' with his older brother (signed 
to MCA and Island Records as 'Steve Spacek'). After releasing one 12" on 
their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 
'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further 
two years.

In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to 
be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst 
experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade 
Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic 
sound. This 12. was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many 
such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a 
collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ 
(under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).

It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his 
apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to 
collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released 
on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management 
led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that 
Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad 
Company UK began in earnest.

Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of 
re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre 
and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first 
drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum & Bass' biggest anthems The 
Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on 
this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.

Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their 
collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including 
Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad 
Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum & Bass 
with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside 
The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on 
the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts 
behind it.

>From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to 
snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a 
drum & bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, 
NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time 
the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream 
success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking 
was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum www.dogsonacid.com. 
This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express 
opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&b's global 
community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) 
unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a 
typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.

Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance 
album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late 
night studio sessions spent creating d&b classics such as The Pulse, 
Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo 
and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.

2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in 
D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on 
Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing 
Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. 
Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as "a 
group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk., Spacek define a 
new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's 
electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has 
since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB 
scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album 
spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his 
brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a 
self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 
Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.

Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, 
collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album 
currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, 
Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for 
their unique brand of UK Soul.

The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the 
fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum & bass label Exit 
Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren.s desire to be able to 
express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a 
contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a 
natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company 
UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a 
diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. 
With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect 
next from D-Bridge?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fwd: [mw] wtf?

I consider myself an audiophile and my ears continue
to tell me that digital formats sound way WAY better
than vinyl. It's really not even close, esp. the high
end frequencies that you barely even hear on records. 

I strongly question the hearing of anyone who says
vinyl sounds better... it may just be that nostalgia
has muddied your hearing... but I fully expect someone
to argue this point with me and try to convince me
otherwise. 

It's not a matter of opinion... if you think the
average record sounds better than the average CD you
are just plain wrong.

Oh, and anyone who would shell out nearly $20K for
that contraption has to be certifiable.

So then you're not anywhere near an audiophile.

Yeah I could so see my boss, who's an audiophile, get one of these.   
I know he did have some expensive turntable with a huge platter on it  
and whatnot.  Then mentioned he had one of those disc washer machines  
and first thing I asked was if I could use it :)  Never did give an  
answer...

well we could use a few more arguments (stupid or not)
on here... we could use a few more ANYTHING on here as
this list has become really dull and I miss the old
flame wars and infighting... 

I want those who think vinyl sounds better to tell me
WHY they feel that way... explain yourselves...
Entropy??? Anyone??? 

Does anybody think that Brinkmann turntable would be a
good investment and/or is worth all that loot??? (even
if you were filthy rich) Gimme some insight into what
you musical geniuses think. Sell me on why vinyl and
turntables are the best and why my ears decieve me.

I prefer mp3s over anything.

But I DO use strictly analog recievers (Pioneer), equalizers (ADC), and

<<My ears like vinyl beter.>>

Why!?!?!?

Thats all I want to know... I don't want to argue I
just want some specifics as to why you feel that way.

I still have an ancient cassette of an Adam Bomb set
you gave me at u4ia waaay waay back. Sound quality
aint so hot but it's got the dopest tracks!!! ;-)
I used to listen to it all the time when I drove my
grandmas shitty Cavalier with a cassette deck when I
lived up there. It's still in her console last time I
checked. Those were the days.

Honestly I don't think I could explain it so that you would understand. I'm
just not good at explaining things but I am not trying to bullshit anyone,
vinyl just sounds beter to me. I'm not a purist, I can listen to mp3's all
day long, it doesn't bother me but given the choice I would rather listen t=
o
the records.

I still have an ancient cassette of an Adam Bomb set

It really suprises me how many people tell me stuff like that. I didn't
really think I gave out that many tapes back in the day. But thats sweet as
hell, I'm glad you enjoyed it enough to remember it this long. Makes it
worth doing really. Look out for the next one, I will try not to dissapoint=

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fwd: [mw] wtf?

Well, here's some technical facts betwen vinyl and cds:

records have a 48khz sampling rate (hope that's the right term) and  
some say even higher, CDs are limited to 44khz.
CD's, as well as all digital formats have a set "resolution" to them  
(on a cd it's essentialy just morse code etched in with a "laser  
beam"), records are the actual waveforms, adjusted because of how  
frequencies work (you just can't take the raw output of a turntable  
and just boost the gain, it needs to go through a special RIAA-curve  
that adjusts the frequencies to the correct levels).
Because of that, anything analog--tapes, vinyl, 8 track, wheel-to- 
wheel--aren't susceptible to any sort of "artifacting" you can get  
with digital formats.  This gets more obvious the lower the bitrate  
you use for mp3s and such.

Personally, I like mp3s, the slight dedregation in audio quality is  
vastly overweighed by the convenience.  I have ipod with 1,000 songs  
on it, try to carry 1,000 records with you, heck even 80-100 records  
can be a back breaking task.  Then some portable way of playing them?

 Vinyl sounds better to me too.  More
"full"...."warm".
I can't explain it with a set of words....but now
there are two votes for vinyl sounding sweet.

Todd gave the facts, which are pretty accurate.  When you are talking about 
high quality .wav it is very difficult to tell the difference.  CD (wav 
format) doesn't reproduce baselines as much (Todd didn't document that, and 
those facts are out there) but the high end is nearly undetectable.  I do 
think, at times, the high end in CDs sounds really compressed, and a little 
more pronounced than is intended.  Mastering has corrected this problem with 
earlier cd's, though.  The separation in channels is often better with CD. 
To really notice I think you have to have experience in eqing a 
soundsystem..  If you eq to a cd, vinyl will still sound fine and often 
overpower the bass.  When you eq to vinyl, however, it is REALLY easy to 
hear the difference.

When it comes to .mp3, you can almost always tell the difference. Mp3 sound 
somewhat hollow in comparsion to digital.  It is difficult to hear this on 
certain sound systems, though.  I also like to think that something gets 
lost in compression with digital.  Files are encoded for smaller size which 
means some of the data is lost in the sampling rate, as stated.  I think 
data also gets cut above and below certain frequencies, and that as I 
mentioned is documented.  In addition to that (and this is speculation) 
there probably is some sort of "gate" that helps determine which part of the 
sound is labeled as relevant and which is marked as "dead space" for 
compression.

When it comes to the studio, much of it is a matter of preference.  Most 
people think analog sounds warmer.  On another note, some prefer the 
humanization of music versus the preciseness of computer.  I often prefer a 
more organic sound as opposed to a mechanical sound, with exceptions for 
certain genres like techno.. but that is TOTALLY a matter of preference. 
When it comes to analog vs digital it is easiest to think of it like 
classical piano.  You can program a piece as written into a midi controller, 
and it will sound exactly as written every time. You can have different 
pianists play a piece and it sounds different each time with different 
emphasis on different notes, timing, volumes, etc.  Consider that a really 
good composer could never really document exactly how a piece should be 
played, and that all a computer is ever going to do is to play it the same 
every time as the beats fall into its time code.  But this is a COMPLETELY 
different discussion.

Digital vs vinyl in regards to djing, however, is a topic that is senseless 
to discuss.

What a load of shit.  "True artists" come from all mediums.
Spinning records is more aesthetically pleasing, but if you have a dope 
track, and don't drop it because "true artists" don't use CDJ's, you're a moron.
 
and by the way....."true artists" make their own music....they don't jack others' sounds and call themselves artists.
 
 
 
vinyl = art
CD/MP3 = wedding DJ

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fwd: [mw] wtf?

todd, there is no sampling rate for analog things.  that's the point 
here:  analog is how we hear things.  even the best A/D and D/A 
converters paired up will not be as good as something that did not 
have to go to digital at all.  Even if the difference is beyond a 
person's hearing, analog will always be better than digital, albeit 
only in theoretical terms.  This is why the audiophiles get so crazy 
about it.  they are trying to achieve the perfect analog system, 
which lacks the distortion inherent in such technology that is by 
definition absent in digital.  Once a signal goes analog, any type of 
EMI can after the signal, causing a decrease in fidelity.  if you are 
able to eliminate the interference, then you can get closer to the 
"ideal" system, where analog is far better than digital.

if you think digital is better than analog, chances are you haven't 
heard a good analog system.

BUT, it is all pointless if you listen to electronic music which was 
probably digital to begin with.  (unless you have a synth with real 
analog effects on it like one of the roland classics.)

argue away!

I agree with you Doug.  I was over doing it with the second part of my post.  There is definitley an art to DJ'ing and there are many DJ's who can paint a crowd into a mood or tone.  But I also just watched Stewart Walker destroy a dancefloor with an old MPC and an FX processor.  Art spans all mediums.


<<<<<<and by the way....."true artists" make their own music....they don't 
jack others' sounds and call themselves artists.>>>>>

There is definately an art to programming a room and moving people forward 
and educating them.  This brings up a WHOLE other debate, though.   I 
believe we are definately headed down a path where the role of dj and artist 
is diverging.   (It has already merged).  An artist is capable of doing SO 
much more than a dj, and part of the problem with the current schema of DJ 
CONCERTS is that an artist (as dj) has different goals when entertaining a 
crowd and it has had a negative effect on forward progression of music, 
clubbing, and nightlife.   If you think about it, holding a "dj artist" to 
the same standards that we hold rock musicians to means that these kinds of 
people are relatively undynamic because they produce tracks that all are the 
same bpm and have little stand-out qualities to them.  There is a lot more 
to be said about this.

What a load of shit.  "True artists" come from all mediums.
Spinning records is more aesthetically pleasing, but if you have a dope 
track, and don't drop it because "true artists" don't use CDJ's, you're a moron.

its worth noting a few of the roland classics actually have digitally 
controlled analog oscilators for tuning stability, digital patch storge, and 
sample based drum sounds.

i would think that bass would suffer on vinyl, you'd have DC offsets and
other likely things.  hard to explain.

mastering is where the compression is introduced.  theres a great writeup
somewhere out there that cites rush albums as a great indicator how
compression has been used more and more in recordings (showing older cds
working up to newer ones).  basically the pressure to get "more volume" on
a cd, which isn't really more volume, rather a perceived volume at the
cost of mangled peaks.

> The separation in channels is often better with CD.

without a doubt, you have to watch the phase or something fun when
mastering vinyl, otherwise the groove becomes unplayable.  you hook one
channel up to the X on an oscilloscope and the other to a Y and you should
generally see a diagonal line.  if it becomes circular "really bad things"
can happen

> When it comes to .mp3, you can almost always tell the difference. Mp3
> sound somewhat hollow in comparsion to digital.

yes, mp3 is lossy, it drops out things that generally your brain doesn't
"hear".  harmonics in the higher end and things like that i'm guessing
(when cymbals hit would be a good place to drop harmonics?)  atrac is also
lossy (minidisc).  there are non-lossy formats like flac that aren't
heavily in use, but around, and apples rip off of that format--the aac
format??

> senseless to discuss.

yep, but it seems to be the only big topic of discussion here, maybe a
list name change is in order?  it only comes up every other month if not
more often!  pb-loves-vinyl-cle-loves-cds??

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fwd: [mw] wtf?

an mpc(with the multi output card), good dual processor efx box, and a small 
mixing desk really are all you need for destroying a crowd...one day im just 
gonna do a live set with my mpc...the caveat to the mpc only live set is, 
you have to have quite alot of stuff pre-programmed...as you dont wanna stop 
the mpc mid set to have to do something like load a sound...which cant do 
with the sequencer running.

its also possible to destroy a crowd with just an 808 and 303....or a 909 
and a 303...or if your really good, a 707 and a 303...or if you're super 
ghetto chicago style, a 707, 303, and casio rz-1(one of my personal 
favorites, the clap is JACK! i finally got it to sync to midi!! woohoo!!!)

oh and btw...stewart walker also has a kurzwiel k-2000 in his live 
rig....the mpc is probably just the drums and the midi sequencer....if u 
dont know a k-2000 is the most advanced modular on the planet and its only 
takes up 3u!

You probably meant to write "Kurzweil makes the most advanced..."

The K-2500 series and up has a "live mode" where you can run an external
input through the dsp engine in "real-time".  Running a live microphone
through the DSP is amazing - especially if you "reverse" the sample which
actually reverses the live input.  The keys on the keyboard also pitch up
and down the live input.  Very strange...

While there is no sampling rate there still is a finite bandwidth to a 
physical analog medium.

Since sound can only be produced as a perfect wave, it goes that a 
perfect analog signal can be produced from a digital source.  However, 
that is just for a single signal.  What happens when you layer multiple 
signals on top of each other as in music?  The multiple signals could 
line up with each other in an infinite number of places, creating an 
infinite number of harmonic combinations.  Digital is discrete and knows 
no infinity.  This is what differs it from analog which is a continuous 
system.  It seems like it might be a negligibly small difference but the 
fact is that none of the same rules apply.  A discrete system can never 
be more than an estimation of a continuous system.  But is anything 
really a continuous system?  Once you get down to a subatomic level 
everything is discrete.  Our brain is made of atoms with electrons 
having discrete valences and discrete spins.  But atoms are particles.  
Does that explain how we think?  Recent studies have suggested that 
there is much more to our brains than a logical neural network.  Our 
brains are quantum computers operating on string theory.  The secret to 
consciousness its self may be in quantum strings with infinite harmonic 
combinations.  The difference between the world of continuous and 
discrete systems could be at the scientific basis of what separates 
digital computers and us.  What allows us to be and them not to be.

All turntables have far more mechanical distortion than even the
cheapest cd player (look up wow and flutter). While it may be
theoretically possible to store a reproduction of a pure waveform on a
piece of vinyl, the first time (and every time after) a needle touches
it, it is degraded. I've heard of turntables that read the vinyl with a
laser, but then you're getting away from the analog playback anyway.

Lots of people think this, but when tested, most people can't pick out
the mp3 (even at 128k) unless it is badly encoded.

Try it yourself if you like.

The human ears and brain are pretty easy to fool when it comes to sound.
Leaving out the things we'll ignore anyway only makes sense. ;)

Yeah, I actually dj'ed a wedding this summer with two other friends (all vinyl)
It was a pleasant surprise.
 
I think weddings are some of the tightest vinyl gigs there are.
People are wasted, they get the mad dance on, and you can play everything from Michael Jackson to MF Doom to Angel Alanis to Roni Size......its all good.
 
I did have to scour some bins for some old soul records for the slow dance (thank you Al Green).

see now this is what I was looking for... I am very
impressed with the responses... particularly B.j.'s.
There are some really, really deep and intelligent
peeps on here and it made my day coming home from work
to read what yinz had to say and that intelligent
discourse is not dead. Good stuff.

I think I worded my statement wrong.  I meant to say that you can almost =
always tell the differnce between mp3 and vinyl.  With good encoding, =
the difference between mp3 and wav is minor but still exists.  I don't =
think I could hear the differnce on computer speakers or headphones, =
though.  =20

As far as "Leaving out things we'll ignore", well, that's an ENTIRELY =
different discussion.  It's all a matter of perspective.   When it comes =
to efficiency, it is better to leave stuff out that isn't needed.  When =
it comes to art, however, it is all about detail and little things that =
average people tend to ignore or overlook.   This is a concept that has =

  Lots of people think this, but when tested, most people can't pick out
  the mp3 (even at 128k) unless it is badly encoded.

  Try it yourself if you like.

yeah the k-2000 is rackmount.

i think thd 2500 is the keyboard version of it, but its the same hardware 
internally.


Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

I think it's just a silly argument to have because most of the people=20
chiming in aren't audiophiles, and even then probably don't have=20
accurate listening systems anyway.   And anyway, a lot of the quality=20
has to do with your A/D D/A converters.. A cd is not a cd is not a cd.=20=
=20
There is a difference between how a properly pressed cd might sound and=20
a cdr might sound, in terms of error rates, jitter etc.  Given the best=20
quality environments and recording processes, you'd probably be hard=20
pressed to say what sounded better if the same person mastered both the=20
vinyl and cd, and also if the vinyl lacquer was cut from some processes=20
through the digital domain (most likely in the current edm world) as=20
well.

I love vinyl.  Its great.  But what do these arguments really do other=20
than let all the amateur experts chime in and fill up everyones inbox=20
with their dick measuring contest..
