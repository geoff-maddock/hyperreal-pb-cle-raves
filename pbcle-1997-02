hi everyone,

	i just have a couple things to say. first, someone asked if anyone
was going to the first tonight in akron. well, from what i've heard a lot
of people from pittsburgh are going, i know i am. for those of you
interested, i'll be the red-head passing out get down flyers. i'm
friendly, and love to meet new people, so come up and say hello! 
	on another note about get down, for those of you who don't know,
get down is my birthday party, and it's on my birthday, so i hope everyone
will come out to help me celebrate. the vibe is going to be so cool. also
a note about get down, we are still trying to get a new space, but don't
be disappointed if it isn't, all the people who think the media is god and
saw 20/20 don't want to give us spaces now.
	
	and that leads me to the last topic i had. hasn't anyone heard
about mystic? it is on march 1st and is looking to be one of the best
parties this year with two debut appearances, by mark-e-quark and david
alvarado. all the other djs are great also, not a bad one on the line-up.
just curious about it 'cause no one has mentioned it yet.

	anyway, look for me at the first, and i'll be happy to meet any of
you.

dori

Crazy was at this little backwoods club/restaurant type structure deep 
within North Park.  It was a great site for a rave, but the last time I 
was there, there was maybe fifteen people there.  For the lives of me, I 
can't rememeber where it is, but if anyone needs a floorplan of the 
place, let me know.  :)

You know, 
  I was looking at the Mystic flier and the entire look of it plus the
lineup leads me to conclude that this is a Sunshine Kids party or is
someway related to the Sunshine Kids, right? The reason I'm asking you
this Doreen is because well, you are a Sunshine Kid and therefore you'd
know. What's the scoop on "Twin Productions"?

Also a note to those who came out for Technique, I really enjoyed playing
again in Pittsburgh. Gosh it's been what, 7 months or so? While playing
out of town is nice there is a special vibe that we've got here in P-burgh
that I;'ve yet to encounter elsewhere. I hope to play here again soon and
I just wanted to say the reason I haven't been booked here until Technique
is not because I haven't wanted to be. That said, thanks again. I hope you
had as much fun as I did!

*C*A*U*T*I*O*N* long review *C*A*U*T*I*O*N* long review *C*A*U*T*I*O*N* 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
here is my review of The First, this party was quite an adventure, in 
kind of good + bad ways. fortunately the whole time i was there
driving all over the city, i didn't get lost in akron once. which is 
pretty amazing, since it's a very confusing city & i've gotten lost 
every other time i was there when i DID have directions!
 
me & my friends chris/dj buff, wanda, deena, + vanita got there pretty
early, around 10:30. there weren't that many people there yet. the 
music was pretty good, lots of breaks :]. but at about 11:30 the
lights came on & it was said the party was being moved. somebody said
that somebody had gotten busted for i think pot. now that's really
dumb for 2 reasons: 1. there were 8-10 cops at the door searching
everybody. anyone with something on them & 1/2 a brain would go back
to their car + hide it. 2. one person getting busted is not any reason
to shut down a whole party (but the tyranny of the cops became more
apparent later).

so the party was supposed to go to the interbelt (a club in akron), we
go there & it was still a regular club nite + the owner said they
couldn't have it there until 3:30 when they closed. the cops were
already at THIS place too by then + were telling us to leave. as we
were leaving i was leaning out the window trying to ask people where
it would be next, somebody said gargoyles, which is apparently another
club, + a cop said to me "we're shutting down that place next in about
30 seconds." so we got out of the way from holding up traffic & start
driving thru downtown & still asking all the people we were driving
along next to. finally this guy says come over to our house + hang out
while we figure out what's going on. so we follow him + there's a
house party starting there & after a while the infoline got updated 
saying the party really would end up at the interbelt.

meanwhile chris & vanita were tired & since we had plenty of gas, i 
drove them back home to kent, then drove back to akron again with
wanda + deena. by then it was 4:00 + we showed up at the interbelt but
it was closed. then we somehow found gargoyles which was also closed +
went back to the house party + nobody was home. so we knew the party
(the original one) was still going on, otherwise everybody would be
home. so we stopped at a gas station to call the infoline & saw some
kind of familiar-looking people. i asked them + they showed us it was
just down the street at this bar called brewski's.

the bar was so packed that you could barely move thru it, + probably
about 95 degrees + so humid it was hard to breathe. there were about
twice as many people as at the 1st place, but in about 1/2 as much
space. that went on for a while longer + then the cops showed up THERE
at 5:00 + shut it down AGAIN. it took a long time to get 300 people or
so out the 1 small door there & everybody had to find the people they
came with, while the cops were outside yelling at everyone, saying
"how old are you!?!?" (these people were 21-23 years old), "do you
have drugs on you?!?!?" etc. then they got the owner outside + started
interrogating him! this cop was yelling at him saying "do you know how
many underage people in there are drinking!?!? do you know how many
people in there have drugs!?!? i could go in there + find (some # of)
people underage!!! i could go in there + find (some # of) people on
drugs!!! i could throw you in jail right now!!!" i feel so sorry for
that poor guy who was doing his best to stand up to the cop, i hope
he's not in trouble, he did nothing wrong. then i saw a paddywagon
sitting in the middle of the street. that's when i kind of freaked
out, i can't afford to get in trouble at all. the cops were talking on
their car speakers saying "i want to see everybody moving. if you're
standing around you're going to jail." does anybody know if anybody
got arrested? i really hope not, that's so scary. plus i hope those
cops couldn't find a reason to arrest anyone because they don't
deserve it. all they deserve is being fired for harrassing innocent 
citizens. but then i still hadn't found my friends but finally did & 
ran across the street & got directions to the afterhours, which was at
somebody's house, + which (the directions) i immediately forgot.
 
we all jumped in our cars fast + peeled out away from those cops. i
listened to my intuition about who to follow since everybody was going
in 100 directions at once + luckily we happened to follow the right
car + ended up at the right place. the sound system went in the
basement so there wouldn't be noise complaints. it seemed like
everybody who was at the bar, ended up at this house which was then
even MORE packed. there was a little room to dance + dante finally got
to go on, who was the only dj whose name i heard. he played funky
breakbeat disco house sort of stuff. as far as i know the cops did not
shut down this place, at least until about 7, because we were tired &
left then.

has anybody heard anything else about the situation with the cops?
please post it if you have, thanks! :] and much thanks to all the
people who put out so much effort to keep the party going no matter
what & to everybody who didn't give up on it either + went to it no
matter where it moved to. that is such a good feeling when that many
people believe that much. throughout the entire nite there were all
good vibes from everybody because they believed in the party & would
not let the cops win! =] =]

    Just thought I'd 2nd that review of Technique - I had a total blast!
:) The vibe was soo high, from the moment I stepped in the door to the
sounds of some hardcore I knew it was going to be a good time.
	Lots of smiles, and I met lots of nice new people :)...
I think the best thing was lots of people were up an 'shakin the booty'
throughout the night instead of just sittin' around (which, well, even I
do on occasion).  Another thing is each set was quite good for me...if it
wasn't for the sauna-like effects going on in the place, I wouldn't have
stepped out all night.
   THE highlight had to be that track dieselboy dropped near the very
end...OH MY GOSH <to borrow a cliche>...absolutely stormin' annurism
heart-attack cauzin molecular atom-smashing daaaaarkness, with an nice
slow build up....kids were goin' totally mental....the most nessicary
re-wind I'v heard in a while. :)  Not sure, but I think its and Ed
Rush/Trace track, maybe only a dub - I want it!!
  These are the kind of raves I love to see in pgh - medium sized, a good
mix of everyday ravers and occasional or new kids, a diverse line-up, a
killer vibe...while i like to see out-of town talent, it totally proves
that pghs scene is strong as far as dj's and kids.  Another good thing (no
i cant stop)...$6 - now that's the way it should be done...i hope Empire
at least made even, but at that fun/$'s I'll support em' every time. :)

have phun kids,

    Subject: 20/20 thoughts...(serious)
    Date: Sun, 02 Feb

    
    i know this is an old thread but i currently only have intermittent net
    access and am in the process of catching up (forgive me).  the benefit of
    this has been that i've had some more time to mull this whole issue over.
    
    like many of you, i was very surprised, scared, angry, and disappointed
    with 20/20's representation of our scene.  whatever truths it contained--
    such as the drug abuse problem which we all know so well--were couched in
    such derogatory language that it seems as if the rave scene is totaly
    without merit and devoid of common sense.
    
    for me, it raised a lot of problematic questions: how could so-called
    'responsible' journalists present such a one-sided story?  how could they
    seriously examine the extremely-rare substance-related deaths within the
    rave scene without comparing them with substance-related deaths in the
    wider culture?  why did the selected ravers seem so inadequate in their
    defense of their culture?  why wasn't there scarcely a word about the
    _music_ which, arguably, is what brings most of these people together in
    the first place?  and so on.
    
    all of these questions took on even more personal proportions by the
    inadequate response of this very list.  sure, there's been a general call
    to arms against ABC news, and a discussion/admission about the truth of
    the drug problem, but none of us has reiterated the importance of the
    _music_ (does it really go without saying?), and i have yet to see any
    kind of cohesive, well-thought out _critique_ of the story itself. 
    
    i know, i know...this list is basically a family forum; a place where we
    REACT to things, and where we talk about our gripes and glories with the
    common understanding that we share a similar culture.  in that sense, for
    me to expect an academic, intelligent critique of the 20/20 story is a bit
    unfair.
    
    but i do firmly believe that unless we present a cogent, serious criticism
    of the story, then any amount of spamming or reacting won't do us any
    good.
    
    some of you (and others throughout the country) have already--and
    admirably--taken the time to write to ABC news with your personal
    reactions to the story; so even as i write this, the producers and
    responsible parties behind the scenes over at 20/20 probably already know
    about our discontent.  as for myself, i haven't written them yet because i
    want to compose something more serious for them to digest...something that
    goes a step beyond reaction, to actively _challenge_ their journalism.
    
    at the risk of promising more than i can deliver, i want to sketch a
    document that will more fully explore some of the most potent issues that
    surround this story.  i fully expect to be critiqued in turn by this list,
    and in fact i hope some of you do take some time to respond to what i
    write, in the hope that any document i may eventually send to ABC news
    will reflect the input of our own little community--thereby making it
    stronger. 
    
    okay, here goes:
    
    first of all, we already know how drug-oriented this report was.  while
    the truth of our scene's drug problem is an enourmous weight on our own
    minds (whether we use drugs or not) and an obstacle in our ability to
    argue the merits of the rave scene, i think there are several ways of
    mitigating the damage done by those who see raves as being nothing more
    than 'portable crackhouses' (to paraphrase someone i met recently).
    
    first of all, there is the issue of alcohol.  alcohol is only a marginal
    substance at most raves.  there are some places where alcohol is sold at
    raves (especially where the events are held at clubs, like here in san
    francisco), but as a whole, alcohol only plays a minor role as a substance
    in our scene. 
    
    if 20/20 were truly interested in presenting a balanced story (which would
    not seem to be the case here) they would have compared substance abuse in
    the rave scene with other youth cultures such as gangs, fraternities/
    sororities, and so on.  i guarantee that even a casual study of substance
    abuse in all youth cultures would show that drug use is UP in all of them,
    and the root cause is not--as 20/20 seems to imply--some irresponsible
    rave promoters, but a wider phenomenon which has yet to be described
    fully. 
    
    also, in response to the concern over the drug-related deaths that have
    occured in the rave scene, a responsible journalistic approach would be to
    compare the frequency of substance-related deaths in the wider culture to
    those of the rave scene.  the result, as we all know, would probably be
    an astonishing counterpoint to 20/20's skewed allegations.  in the mw
    area, for example, of the handful of scene-related deaths that i am aware
    of, NONE OF THEM WERE DRUG-RELATED.  they were all automobile-related;
    whether it be a loss of vehicle control or a driver falling asleep.  this
    is not to say we haven't been tremendously lucky (we have), but it does
    give us added weaponry to counteract such wild exaggerations of the
    'dangers of the rave scene' (altho at this point i will also add that
    there probably have been drug-related deaths in the scene which we don't
    know about).
    
    the occasional death of a raver is of course nothing to laugh about, it's
    a tragedy every time it happens--drug-related or not.  but i also take
    issue with 20/20's wild implications about what danger raves represent. 
    they use the story of the girl from orlando as an emblem to warn parents
    about raves, and even go so far as to say: "the only good news for us is
    we didn't start this one.  it came from england, where there have been
    more than a dozen, about 15 deaths.  so, we didn't start it, but we're in
    the midst of it right now."  this is patently ridiculous and i can't
    believe it got aired.  aside from the fact that they didn't seem to do a
    lick of research into where raves really began (they began with music
    created in US clubs), their grasp of statistics seems pretty off.  15
    deaths is not a good thing, obviously, but let's do some basic math: 
    
    parties have gone on in england for about 10 YEARS now.  how many people
    have attended these parties?  an accurate total would be hard to come by,
    but since we know there are regularly parties with 10,000, 20,000, 40,000
    people (!) then we begin to get the picture: these deaths are
    statistically insignificant.  i'd like to see them compare the 15 deaths
    in england's rave scene (a statistic which they don't even acknowledge the
    source of) with deaths in other subcultures or other cross-sections of
    british society.  in other words i bet it's statistically a lot more
    dangerous to cross the street than it is to go to a rave. 
    
    now, of course 20/20 would at this point take issue with the alleged
    damage to young minds and bodies from all this substance abuse (with
    doctors such as david mcdowall to back them up), to which i would say:
    yes, they have a right to be concerned, we're concerned about it
    ourselves.  but the fact is, no matter how many so-called 'experts' you
    bring out of the labs to claim that such-and-such-a-drug can slowly kill
    you or damage you, i would argue that there simply hasnt been enough
    research to prove anything one way or another.  why?  because these are
    _illegal_ substances (or legal substances like K used illegally).  i'm no
    expert, in fact i'd admit to a great ignorance about drugs in general, but
    i do know that you can't do research on the effects of illegal substances
    when they can't be obtained legally!  this is part of what is fueling the
    current debate about pot here in california--we simply dont know what the
    real long-term effect of mary really is (not to mention the fact that i
    agree with with the postmodernist philosophy that calls empiricism and
    objectivity severely into question...but that's another story ;). 
    
    now as far as alcohol, on the other hand, we DO know the long-term
    derimental effects, yet our culture says it is okay to use it (this
    contradiction about our society has been brought up before, it's nothing
    new). 
    
    related to this is the issue of violence.  one thing i feel very good 
    about in our scene is the lack of violence.  yeah, maybe everyone's too 
    cracked-out to really get riled up about anything, but compare our scene 
    to others where violence is frequent and even _celebrated_.  i wish 20/20 
    had thought of that one.
    
    and this is just a beginning.
    
    anyway, sorry to be so long-winded, in a way this whole thing seems 
    redundant.  i'm sure plenty of people are writing 20/20 already with 
    their critiques, maybe mine's not going to help anything.  in some ways 
    it was just a simple 'expose' designed to alert concerned parents to the 
    dangers of this subculture...which they have a right to be concerned 
    about.  but on another level, we have yet another example of an attempt 
    to demonize something by presenting it in a sensational way...which only 
    serves to make it seem more 'cool' to the kids involved.  
    
    maybe they did it on purpose?
    
    feedback please.

> [=snip=] warning> long post about stuff i wanna say.

ed, you post was well written, and i also have read a newsweek arctcle on
the medical uses of pot, as i see you may have read or are aware..
id like to bring into light my views on why we rave, why we do actually
research illegal drugs illegal, and why why we think we are right when
others seem to "know" we are wrong. Its sort of like a question of the
chicken or the egg.. why do we seem to rebel against the powers that be? do
we know they are wrong already or do we just want to find out? its a double
edged sword, like everything else, and the key to understanding is to throw
away causality.
dancing and music and feeling is a priori to us, there is no cause. if
anything its love that perpetuates our actions and percieved "risks."

i taped 20/20, a show that seems to have had a profound affect on parties
everywhere; and after watching it the second time jsut a few moments ago,
(the first time it made me just plain angry), i feel that we must now focus
on the legality of what weve been avoiding...and we must show that we are a
culture that wont die becuase we have the ability to change faster than
most people can notice. we have love on our side here, so i am positive we
can maybe bring to life some of the facets that keep us strong. we are
being watched more than ever now, and to show that our celebrations of life
are more than just places to get high, we must show the other side of
death- birth.
        To many of us, this culture, which many of us are entranced in and
recognize this is more than a phase or a trend, is constantly being
misunderstood through the word RAVE. i call it a culture because we have
giving birth to many new concepts, many new ideas, many new directions for
people who have never had the oppurtunity to be in touch with their
trance-state, that is the state of one-ness within life. many people have
found it easier through drugs like lsd and mdma, perhaps even ketamine; to
the beter of us, we consider these drugs doorways to new concepts, not just
something we do to feel better.
        This one-ness is possible without drugs, of course, but the analogy
on how i see "to do or not to do" is similar to what happened to the
american indians when they discovered peyote as a quicker and more reliable
way to reach a state of consciousness of the unconscious, which was
previously done through starving for three or four days until one's
blood-sugar level was low enough to see one's dreams, something all of us
as humans strive for. many of us have given birth to our unconscious in the
dance scene, and feel a sense of acceptance and awareness of our individual
one-nesses through our dreamlike melodies and heart-reaching rhythms.
        We dance in celebration of life, love. we are artists. there is
life and there is people watching life. i feel that people like us who have
lived our dreams through or by music and dancing have found a freedom that
is priceless; a lot of people are in it for money, detracting from our
vibe. but most of us are friendly indiviuals with no ulterior motives to
continue going to parties. otherwise we wouldnt go. 20/20 doesnt like how
beautiful we are. we arent a concert. we dont go to church. we dont believe
tv. we could be considered mad.
        To a clinical psychologist or doctors, who make up the
organizations which decide whether drugs should be legalized, this is
dangerous because clinical psychologists were trained not to see oneness.
they were trained as scientists, seperating dreams from reality, body from
mind, heart from soul.
        Take that with the fear that we feel we see more to life than
following our country's leaders, and you could have a full scale revolution
on our hands. Revolution of the trance-state. more and more of us are
listening to our dreams, and to some extent the american dream of freedom,
which of course was not shaped by anyone from europe. This revolution will
be a musical and spiritual one, and just as american indians have religious
ties to peyote, we will have religious ties to e and lsd.  but of course,
im getting ahead of myself. religion has bad connotations, and this scene
will never be organized in a fashion that has universal meaning and our
language will never be preached. Theyre is love here, and some people
confuse that with ego. maybe im getting off track here. the point is,
people fear for us. our parents fear for us, they fear the future, of what
we are becoming. and we dont.
        Our culture is of higher evolution than the contemporary majority,
as most of us i believe; otherwise we wouldnt be a part of it. So really,
its not about standing up to our leaders. its about stepping down and
seeing their level. we know why 20/20 was successful in proving what they
wanted to prove. Their ethos has been achieved through years and years of
doing the same thing to others, we arent special victims. One week its
contractors who still use asbestos, and one week its ravers who still use
drugs.
        20/20 showed americans fear of a culture through blatantly pointing
out what we are doing wrong. weve all raved without drugs. weve all loved
without drugs. but we must stay positive in our claim that there is a
legitimate reason why we use e and lsd. its definately not just to break
the law. its to strike a balance and open doorways of the mind.
        Most people have only seen the darkside to rave, ravershadow; our
secretiveness, our ego, our drug use. but our spirituality is ancient, and
20/20s bickering is pointless to us that really know whats going on. I
suggest everyone look at Star Wars as being a very contemporary drama
(contemporary because its almost universal). We must learn from our
darkside, and resist its persuasion. we you are walking down the street, do
you follow the flow of the path, or do you follow your shadow? which is
stronger, the feeling of love or the sight of enlightenment? these are
questions i myself are dealing with....
       before getting myself spammed, i would like to advise people to know
their rights and stand up for them. Number one, we have the right to free
speech, free press, free assembly, free thought. That means that we have
the right to gather together and dance. we have a right to  be happy. we
have a right to feel good. do have a right to do illegal drugs? not to our
storm troopers of america, so that would only resolved in either the courts
of america or the scales of justice in our minds.

because of 20/20, i think its time to be very cautious with our
celebrations, making sure either it wil be 100% legal and safe, or 100%
undergound and safe.
 sorry for all my ramblings...=) its all good.

joe,

	mystic is NOT a sunshine kids party. twin productions is tim and
ted zelch. they designed the flyer themselves with the help of opus. we
had nothing to do with it. the party is looking to be a great one though
and i was just curious why no one has discussed it yet.

WO what a night, I've never set up a laser show 3 times in one night!  I
could say alot of nasty things about akron's finest but i believe that
ignorance is not a trend.  Here is the reason why the original space had
so much troble.  First of some mother who happened to watch the
informitive 20/20 show also heard that the party was gonning to be their
and called the venue saying " I cann't believe your going to let
something like this happen at a church, if you haven't cancelled it so
should do so now, and i'm calling the police!",  but the gambling(bingo)
in the next room was all right.  so the deal was the first person caught
with drugs or anything and the party was over. the person who did get
caught was walking back to his car to stash 3 bags of a green leafy
substance believed to be BUD, while being followed by the illegally
searching 5-0.  
     then at the interbelt they the owner that if he let this go on at
his club that he would be shut down:(  so every roamed the streets of
akron :)  we had about 100 ppl at our shop which was nice then lee
showed up and gave the news that he had found a space( major props for
that cause 3 mounths earlier i was doin a little club thang their and
got arrested and the party stoped).  the music i did hear was funky but
did not get to hear much cause was wondering about what was goin on too
much:(  i did have a splendid time and much  DANKS to who ever gave me
that brownie;)

  APD has not heard the last of us!

does anyone need a laser show since we didn't get paid we are hurtin and
hobbling, unlike most light copanies we are ravers to and get by week to
week livin off a pb&j and dark beer. give me an email joshua1@uakron.edu

PEACE

Alright heres what went down.  I got out to my boys house in Akron at
around 11:30. We left for the party at 12:15. Right as we were walking
out the door one of our friends came in and said the party was busted
and that it got moved to the Interbelt night club. I was pissed
because we had checked out the location the night before and it looked
like a phat one. So we cruised on down to the Interbelt. All the kids
that were coming out said that this location had gotten busted
too. Someone said something about about another club called Gargoyles
but the cops overheard them and said they would bust that place
also. So we went back to my friends house to evaluate the
situation. Somehow somebody followed us back to my friends house,
because in about a half hour there was a bunch of people from out of
town chilling there. It was all good though.  We called the info line
and they said they were setting up at 3:30 at the Interbelt again. We
got at the Interbelt at about 3:15 and there was some dude there
giving directions to another club called Brewskis on Exchange st. We
got there and it was so hot and so fucking crowded it wasn't even
funny. Eric-D was spinning when I got there, but soon after that they
put a cd on? It took Dante a good 45 minutes to set up, and just as he
was about to put a record on the cops came in and told everyone they
had to leave. We found out about an after party at this dudes house in
Akron. We got there  and Dante was set up in the basement. There was a
sense of dissapointment and also determination in the air. On one last
not I have to say Rectangle broke his arm and wasn't going to spin
anyhow. And I have to give Akron mad props for pulling something of
through all the bullshit. I also want to say thanks to jamie for
letting us chill in his house for the afterparty.
Peace

also. So we went back to my friends house to evaluate the
situation. Somehow somebody followed us back to my friends house,
because in about a half hour there was a bunch of people from out of
town chilling there. It was all good though.  We called the info line
and they said they were setting up at 3:30 at the Interbelt again. We
got at the Interbelt at about 3:15 and there was some dude there
giving directions to another club called Brewskis on Exchange st. We
got there and it was so hot and so fucking crowded it wasn't even
funny. Eric-D was spinning when I got there, but soon after that they
put a cd on? It took Dante a good 45 minutes to set up, and just as he
was about to put a record on the cops came in and told everyone they
had to leave. We found out about an after party at this dudes house in
Akron. We got there  and Dante was set up in the basement. There was a
sense of dissapointment and also determination in the air. On one last
not I have to say Rectangle broke his arm and wasn't going to spin
anyhow. And I have to give Akron mad props for pulling something of
through all the bullshit. I also want to say thanks to jamie for
letting us chill in his house for the afterparty.
Peace

RE:  "ed, you post was well written, and i also have read a newsweek  
arctcle on the medical uses of pot, as i see you may have read or are  
aware..id like to bring into light my views on why we rave, why we do  
actuallyresearch illegal drugs illegal, and why why we think we are  
right when others seem to "know" we are wrong. Its sort of like a  
question of the chicken or the egg.. why do we seem to rebel against  
the powers that be? do we know they are wrong already or do we just  
want to find out? its a double edged sword, like everything else, and  
the key to understanding is to throw away causality.
dancing and music and feeling is a priori to us, there is no cause.if
anything its love that perpetuates our actions and percieved  
'risks'..."

I understand exactly where you're coming from.  The reason 20/20 was  
so successful is that it is in human nature to fear what it does not  
understand.  The report showed the "dangerous" side of the raves, and  
portrayed drugs as a dehabilitory agent, an escape to a  
vegetable-mode of being.  It's the scare tactic - teach people to  
fear what you don't want them to do.  Scare the ignorant into  
submission.
However, the article was drastically one-sided, not attempting to  
understand why raves are what they are.  The reason raves exist and  
people go is not for the drugs, as any raver knows, but for the  
music, the vibe.  The party is a completely different world, where  
there is always growth, love, and commonality;  there is an  
atmosphere that could never be reproduced anywhere else.  It's about  
finding the true self, shedding all the masks society pressures us to  
don, it's about the love of being alive, and leaving the bitter  
hatred, callousness, and other ways of the world behind.  We  
stimulate ourselves to think, to dream, to understand, even outside  
the party, and we are clearly not the same as the rest of society,  
which tries to impress its standards on to us.  We are a new  
generation of people- seeking not worldly knowledge, but that of the  
soul and that which can transcend all mankind, if the individual will  
open his mind, expand his horizons.  

Some people choose to enter this world through the assistance of  
substances, both illegal and natural.  The point is not to get "high"  
or "trashed", but to open up the door and experience it in full.   
Others choose to just relax and not pollute their bodies with  
chemicals.  Either method is a personal choice, and there is no  
pressure to use drugs of any sort at any party I've been at.  If one  
uses a substance as an aid to gain enlightenment, that should be  
distinguished from those who use it to become zombies (who, I might  
add, are NOT into the rave scene).  Those who use to discover  
knowledge and wisdom are not addicts, as there is not usually a  
distinction;  they can and do carry productive and successful lives.   
The addicts and junkies are as different from ravers as Luke  
Skywalker is from Darth Vader (I'm borrowing the Star Wars analogy).   
It's all in how you use what you have.  In one case, it's the Force,  
good v. evil, etc., in the other it's the use of drugs for personal  
enhancement or self-destruction.

dont limit yourself!

 "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of
a digital computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the
top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower. To think
otherwise is to demean the Buddha- which is to demean oneself."
-Robert Pirsig.

Raves may be a place of growth, love, and commonality, but to say that
there it lies and it lies nowhere else is self-deafeting. i consider raves
like big alien conferences, and not the only place to grow. the key is to
take what you like about the vibe and carry that with you everywhere you
go. i understand that there is something about a party that is magical and
could be thought of as temporal, but they gr8 thing is that this magic CAN
be produced anywhere you like! you just have to click your heels three
times. or like peter pan you can fly if you just "tHinK hAppE tHawTs"
sometimes it just takes me a good mixtape...

really im in a silly mood dont think im making fun of you.
everything else you said was on point.
escpecially this quote which, however overused, is still inspirational.

say, tell cats i wanna organize a lil sitdown in front of APD police
station/city hall (same building). Keep your eyes open for a pre-flyer
entitled "PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY". 

	guess i should give ya my name. it's Keane. hi.

	I live in akron and am FUCKIN SICK OF POLICE DISRESPECTING OUR CULTURE.
hear me, OUR culture. when we were pushed out of the space that was PAID
FOR and LEGALLY promised to us AND THEN FOLLOWED EVERYWHERE WE WENT
(which if ya think about it what tha fuck do they expect? when hundreds
of people drive to a city for an event (be it a baseball game even) and
it's closed down for ANY REASON the people will go somewhere else,
ANYWHERE else. if they didn't want "US" all over town they should give
us PEACE and PRIVACY) they weren't harrassing us as partygoers or crazy
tchno "drugheads", WE WERE BEING HARRASSED AS CITIZENS. we were being
denied acces to clubs because of OUR CULTURE. just as if we got turned
away from a restaraunt because we're BLACK or GAY or TALL or SHORT or
whatthefuckever.

	WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR OUR CULTURE. we need to take OUR WAY OF LIFE
seriously. let me draw a parallel of what i see. in our grandparents'
generation there were campaigns against NATIVE AMERICANS, esp those of
the native american church. They (the same system of government STILL IN
PLACE TODAY!) overlooked at the BEAUTIFUL customs and practices of the
tribal people and herded them into camps and "missionary schools"
because all they saw were savages doing PEYOTE. ALL THEY SAW WAS PEYOTE
AND SAVAGES. THE SAME IS HAPPENING TO OUR MODERN TRIBES AND TRIBAL
PEOPLE. we have so much to offer, so much to learn, so much to
contribute but they are STILL harassing US as ignorant DRUG USERS. THEY
DON'T EVEN SEE THIS WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON OF UNITY, ACCEPTANCE, AND
PEACE. they cant set their eyes above or beyond the twenty sacs.

	WE need to be UNASHAMED of what we do. WE NEED TO START DOING IT IN
THEIR FACES (no i'm not talking about bumpin in front of officers. I'm
talking about TAKING A STAND and showing them WE AREN'T YOUR TYPICAL
METALHEAD drugusers in highschool). 

	They think the biggest threat we pose to them is drugs/and usage. (even
though THEY are bringing it to US to sell). We need to show our colors
BOLD AND PROUD. we need to show em we ARE a threat, but not with drugs.
that is old. everyone knows our scene HAS durgs in it (just like their
public schools) but it's NOT ABOUT THAT. THE MOST DANGEROUS THREAT WE
POSE IS IN THE FACT THAT WE THINK DIFFERENTLY THAN THEM. OUR REVOLUTION
IS SPIRITUAL, MENTAL, SOCIAL, PRACTICAL. it is not chemical.

	i want to handle and promote just like a party, including ALL DJs
involved with this on the back. this way kids know this is OUR CAUSE
involving OUR people OUR dj's OUR promoters OUR population. OUR CULTURE.
I'm working on finding a spot after this where we can have a potluck
dinner/lunch and then have a few DJs spin. (if ya know of any down spots
for a small, private, preferably free party email me).

	I want ta have it on a SATURDAY at 4:20 pm. It is all legal, only cats
with something to SAY or CONTRIBUTE (which is everyone i've ever met)
should come. WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT DRUGS, WE ARE NOT BASHING COPS, WE
ARE ADDRESSING THE UNFAIR TREATMENT OF OUR CULTURE.

	we may not be able to get an amplified sound permit, but i'm gonna
check on that this weekend. i already contacted the ACLU and am waiting
for a reply via email (yea, i'm gettin my shit tight and right in the
legeal sight). They will let me know what i can expect int the way of
bullshit misdemeanor assembly charges, etc. I AM NOT AFRAID OF A NIGHT
IN JAIL. WE NEED MORE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T so submissive, chickenshit,
more defending of their rights. I need to check w/the ACLU and maybe a
private attourney about what to do about people w/warrants or probation
or parole. is it illegal for someone on probation to peacably assemble
to express their CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS?  (still, i would advise hanging
in the back of the crowd if you have a warrant. BUT DON'T COME IF YA
HAVE A WARRANT AND LOCAL POLICE RECOGNIZE OR KNOW YOUR FACE).

	i will let EVERYONE know the haps and will hook you ALL up later with
the email addys of the ACLU and maybe a few senators/congressmen and
city officials. PLEASE POST THE SHIT OUT OF THEM!!! we need to bomb them
(i've already started) w/ email that is ;)

	what else........
		hmmmmmmmmmmm

	we're thinking of giving everyone a little card and pencil to write
down something they want to tell the police dept or city officials.
(please, no fuck words. please, no silly dilly DRUG CRAZED RAGER things,
they can't handle it so we have to talk on their level with them since
they can't UNDERSTAND.) imagine sending hundreds of cards to a city
official, send copies to all police seargents, captains, paperpushers,
and NEWSPAPERS each individually sealed in an envelope. we want to let
them know this is a movement OF THE PEOPLE, not a few "leaders" they can
throw in jail or slap a police record onto. this is THE YOUTH FROM
CANADA TO SOUTH AMERICA TO CHINA TO THE PHILLIPEANS TO GREECE. THIS IS
SPONTANEOUS GRASSROOTS UNITY !!!!! please email me with any ideas or
anything you'd like ta see or say. THIS IS OUIR TIME to demand respect
and their undivided attention, so we gotta say SOMETHING!!!!



	i would like ta point out that this is not just about AKRON and ONE
PARTY. support for this is support for parties WORLDWIDE. if we (WHEN
we) pull this PEACEFUL, ORGANIZED assembly off i will PERSONALLY email
EVERY PROMOTER, DJ, V-RAVER, POLITICAL ACTIVIST GROUP about my accounts.
my pitfalls, my successes, things i could've done differently on my end,
and things others can do differently on their ends. we need open
communication so this sin't ONE isolated protest. 

	*flash* imagine this happening ALL OVER AMERICA this summer. carloads
of cats goin on road trips to see friends, have fun AND MAKE LOUD
STATEMENTS. i would go to any coast to help. it'd be fun. it'd be a
better way to channel agression and end up with results.

	So think what ya wanna say. remember to bring your drums and a covered
dish so we can all chill and shoot the shit before having a party. email
your friends, post this on many sites (i'm busy with class now and i
gotta run) as i will be doing my part.

	watch for the preflyer!!!!!!!!

	remember WHAT WE ARE DOING IS "ILLEGAL"
                 WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS WRONG.

Sound like a good idea to me.  While I haven't actually had to deal with
the cops on this level, in this instance they are definately violating
some very basic constitutional rights.  Also props on the ACLU move, has
anyone ever sued the government for this type of thing before?

Perhaps if you dieminate the address to where we could send the little
postcards you mentioned later in the message that would be useful.

yay! a fellow activist!
please let us know when your going to the police station..ill try to come
down, and i'd be very happy to attend and initiate rallys all over the
countries this summer....peaceful fun ones of course=)

okay im gonna tell you a story of my favorite party of all time...
feel free to use it as anectodal evidence..print it out and read to people
if you like...this was a while ago, so its a little dramatized, but its
still true to its vibe, like which i also caught from keanes tone. the
protest itself was just as fun and important as the party to me.


On August 9th, 1996
a very magical thing happened to me.
Revolution was in the air, maybe it was in the numbers of the calander.
It was a calm and peaceful day on the wall across from the O in oakland,
and buzz question of the day was, "are you going to Mi Gnutts?"
"Mi Gnutts?" *laughs* whats that?"
"its a jive turkeyz renegade, its our form of protest to Carnegie Mellon
University."
"What have they done?"

        For ten years, students, hippies, beatniks, visionaries, and
contemporaries have gathered on Carnegie Mellons Campus to protest the
current research on nuclear weapons and engineering of special weapons paid
for and contracted with the pentagon. Each year for three nights they have
brought their drums and their peace pipes, making their natural sounds of
freedom made known to the powers that be. The "Drums of Peace" had become
more of a ritual than a protest, however, and more of a cool thing to do.
       Well this past summer, The Jive Turkeyz had decided that this would
be a perfect time to let OUR "natural" (that is synthesized) sounds of
freedom made known with a generator and 10,000 watts of sound by wizard
workshop. with little complaints from the naturalists, who had resigned
their ears to our statement for a little while, but they probably werent
englighted through fast paced high energy happy hardcore (d.Cypol) and
dancehall jungle (Farmer Tea).
       Joe187 was mc'ing the party for a while, and i think we had it
brodcast over free radio pittsburgh 90.9fm, but i also believe that
strangely the antennae was pointing in the wrong direction to broadcast a
clear signal. this story would have gotten more press if so.
       i had made some really cool friends that even, was reunited with old
ones, and man the vibe of that party was kickin. Carnegie Mellon campus is
purely beatiful. the sound has echoed of the Arts Building Just right, and
after strolling around the premises me and a friend were wondering if we
were actually bothering anyone with the noise, so we decided to walk around
the block near Margaret Morrison street, where the closest residents could
be found.
      On the sidewalk of the street we could barely hear anything, but
maybe our ears were desensitized. But still the sound of a car screaming
down Forbes Avenue was 100 times as loud (thats 10dB) as the faint sound of
music. we concluded that our music could not have been bothering anyone in
the sense that we were imposing on the rights of others. Drums of peace
gatherers probably got annoyed; could be irrelevant *shrug* but if there
was anyone we were bothering, it was them, and this was because of musical
taste, not rights of freedom. we had just as much right to be there as
them.
        If they didnt understand that, they are just as guilty as the
police officer that came (ill get to that in a minute). We had given them
respect because their cause had started a crusade for some against the
government, but their turnout was very skimpy, and by sight it looked like
they were smoking more marijuana than we had cigarettes. who were they to
complain about noise on property that wasnt even theirs? thats why im
pretty sure that they didnt.
        Sure enough, around 3am two campus police officers (the kind that
cant even carry guns because they are so inexperienced) arrived. He rode up
on his bike, and told smartie (the current dj) he has recieved several
noise complaints and asked for us to leave. He asked also to talk with the
person responsible for this gathering. In reality, this was supposed to be
a protest in which all of us were there on our own free will and we were
supposedly responsible for our own beings as united states citizens, but i
guess most people at the event had forgot this (because it was so
beautiful) and immediately submissed upon fear. Some people maybe felt that
they did not have the right to be there, maybe through parental coersion,
etc.
        For this reason, two men, without being asked to see proper
identification, on a bike, without being asked to see a warrant or any
evidence than his word that he has recived noise complaints, would be able
to shut down our event.... i felt an intense feeling of rebellion spawning
inside me, the same motivating force that lets me be who i am and do what i
think is right.
        I walked toward him, being of no physical threat. Among similar
looks of astonishment and let down of important individuals i respect and
admire, i started questioning the officer. I first asked him what his main
intention was.. he replied the repeated lie that there had been noise
complaints. i asked him if he had proof of that. he stumbled upon resonse.
I interuppted and asked if he thought we were doing anything illegal.
        Suddenly, a voice among silence rose out from the speakers. Joe
LeSesne started in a peaceful rhythm, talking about our rights as american
citizens, particularly the first amendment, even more particularly the
freedom of assembly. People started to catch on and stomp and make their
own noise on the dancefloor. people continued dancing. people continued
smiling.... i ran around the dancefloor and tried to get people
motivated...
        But, for some reason, the vibe could not be kept alive, because
people actually believed the police officer... I think we should respect
police officers, but we should never believe them. If we start believe them
and trusting them, we are giving them our energy. they are interogating our
situation, so the best combat is to interogate back. But because people
wanted to play it safe i guess, the party got moved to a club downtown
(where they charged $3 or something to get in) and people started
dispersing..that itself was disapointing.. it was useless to argue with the
cop any longer, he got his little ego trip going....
        If people knew the cause of the party and their right as citizens
to be there,  we could have at least stayed until the police came back with
proof of distturbance...but of course we know thats not how it works... the
law and the way the law is enforced are two way different things. This does
not stop me from protesting. I am not, like keane, afraid to spend a night
in jail, especially if its for standing up and being proud that i like to
dance all night.
        More people need to know their rights to free assembly and the laws
of discrimination DO apply to us. The determining factor of how parties get
shut is the balance of cooperation they recieve. if you give a cop too much
cooperation, theres nothing you can do but complain, and that doesnt solve
anything. we must be proud of our culture, and we need to establish more
defense mechanisms for these ignorant powers that be in our
community...........
        if you feel the cops are doing you a spiritual disservice, condemn
them. you have the power. Interrogate them. Intimitade them. Respect them.
Love them as humans, and show them you care, but not about the way they
enforce the laws.
        i gotta fly....tis not over..=)

I'll put word out among my cabal as well.  We'll be there as well to show 
our support for the scene.

Actually, when I was walking up, a couple of them were beating 
counterpoint to the beats.  It sounded very cool up close.

I'll hold off on the rant about political correctness.

They didn't.  A few of them were bummed it got busted.

A post script to the bust.  I had arrived with a few of my friends for a 
good time.  I made the mistake of asking one of the cops why the party 
was being busted.  I recieved a stare and no answer.

Departure:
	Driving back home, not in a very happy mood anymore 
(/usr/bin/perkyd had been given a kill -9), we got pulled over by the 
cops that broke the party up, plus a true-blue Oakland cop.  Speeding, 
illegal right turn, blah blah blah, almost got busted...

Anarchangel is one of the most careful drivers I know.  He does not 
speed, and none of us saw ANY 'no right turn' sign there.  None of us did 
anything save asking the cop why they were breaking up the party.

If it comes down to it, I'll join both of you.  Hey, maybe they'll let us 
play Illuminati in the holding tank.  Seems apropos...  :D

there for a party, and to let people know that we don't support weapons
research at our Universities, no matter how much "research" grant money
they hand out as bribes.  The crowd that was there was all about peacefull
protest, and I think the event went over very well.  The only difference
between us and the old hippies banging their drums was that we had a very
large generator with us ... and I think that is where we ran into trouble.
 
It's easy to have a protest when everyone is carrying drums and maybe a
megaphone or two, but in the case where a massive sound system is
involved, as well as turntables, a transmitter, microphones, etc. there is
some very expensive equipment to risk.  I think it is fucked up that we 
were forced to shut down, but given the consequences of possibly losing 
thousands of dollars worth of equipment, what else can you do?  

I remember the protest continuing for a while, with people stamping feet 
and blowing whistles in an attempt to keep the party going, but that 
soon fizzled out.  My only suggestion for protests like we're discussing 
here is that, if you're going to involve DJs, make sure you're willing to 
risk your equipment, because if things get out of hand, Johnny Law will 
try to nick your shit and hold it as evidence!  Drum circles, whistles, 
megaphones, clapping hands and stomping feet work great for protests 
'cause no one is going to try and hold any of them as ransom...

I'll close by giving big support for organized demonstrations ... it's 
about time our generation stood up for itself and shook things up a bit.  
This summer looks like it will shape up to have some nice activism ... 
let's use the 'net to our advantage and organize this shit correctly!

<img src="/graphics/abouthdr.gif"><CENTER><h2>How to Request Help from the ACLU</h2></CENTER>
The ACLU cannot process requests for help or legal
advice that are sent through electronic mail nor is this forum a means
for individuals to file a complaint with the ACLU.  In no way
does information gathered from this forum constitute an official
endorsement by the ACLU of any specific legal claim.
<P>
Please understand that the ACLU has limited resources and
staff and is not able to pursue every case that comes to our
attention.  It is difficult to generalize about the type of cases
the ACLU handles, but most of our cases focus on instances where
government has infringed upon a person's privacy, religion, or
speech or where the government has not followed proper
procedures.  We also handle cases involving discrimination on the
basis of such things as a person's race, gender or sexual
orientation.  Even when a case falls under the listed criteria,
this is not a guarantee that we will be able to handle the case;
we try to concentrate on cases that will have a broad impact on a
large number of people.  In general, we do not handle cases
involving such things as evictions, other tenant-landlord
disputes, criminal prosecutions, divorce, child custody, or
wills, unless they raise broader concerns.
<P>
If you believe that your civil liberties have been 
violated and would like to receive help or information from the 
American Civil Liberties Union, it is necessary to put your 
request in writing and mail (or email, if the affiliate has an email address) this request to the affiliate office 
of the ACLU in your state.  The ACLU has affiliate offices in 
most of the fifty states.  To find the affiliate office in your area, use the <a href="/action/chapters.html">Affiliate Directory.</a>
The facts of your case will be reviewed, and,
depending on the available resources, the ACLU will determine 
whether or not assistance can be provided.  Your letter should 
consist of a short summary of the pertinent issues.
<P>
Please try and tell the affiliate the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>What rights you feel have been violated
<LI>The facts of your situation
<LI>Whether and what kind of documentation is available to support
the facts
<LI>The individuals or agencies you are complaining about
<LI>What you would like the affiliate to do
<LI>Your return address and phone number
</ul>
<P>
Please do not send any original documents.  Should the
affiliate need further information, they will contact you for
this information.  Because of the volume of such requests and our
limited number of staff, please put all requests in writing.  
Neither the ACLU or its affiliates have the capability to handle
large numbers of phone calls.
<P>

MARIJUANA AND THE HUMAN BRAIN
by Jon Gettman
High Times
March 1995

In 1970, marijuana was placed on Schedule 1 of the Drug Enforcement
Administration*s controlled-substances list, largely because scientists
feared that, like opiates, it had an extremely high potential for abuse
and addiction. But the discovery of THC receptor sites in the brain
refutes that thinking, and may force both scientists and the DEA to
re-evaluate their positions.

Introduction
The next century will view the 1988 discovery of the THC receptor site
in
the brain as the pivotal event which led to the legalization of
marijuana.

Before this discovery, no one knew for sure just how the psychoactive
chemical in marijuana worked on the brain.  Throughout the 1970s and
1980s, researchers made tremendous strides in understanding how the
brain
works, by using receptor sites as switches which respond to various
chemicals by regulating brain and body functions.

The dominant fear about marijuana in the 20th century has been that its
effects were somehow similar to the dangerously addictive effects of
opiates such as morphine and heroin.  Despite widespread
decriminalization of marijuana in the United States in the 1970s, this
concern has remained the basis for federal law and policies regarding
the use and study of marijuana.

The legal manifestation of this fear is the continued classification of
marijuana as a Schedule I drug, a category shared by heroin and other
drugs that are banned from medical use because of their dangerous,
addictive qualities. While only 11 states have formally decriminalized
possession of small amounts of marijuana, 45 states distinguish between
marijuana and other Schedule I drugs for law-enforcement and sentencing
purposes.

Until the 1980s, technological limitations obstructed scientific
understanding of the neuropharmacology of THC, of how the active
ingredient in marijuana actually affects brain functions.  Observations
and conclusions about this subject, though based on some biological
studies, were largely influenced by observations of behavior.  This has
allowed cultural prejudice to sustain the faith that marijuana is
somehow
related to heroin, and that research will eventually prove this
hypothesis. Actually, the discovery of the THC receptor site and the
subsequent research and observations it has inspired conclusively refute
the hypothesis that marijuana is dope.

Many important brain functions which affect human behavior involve the
neurotransmitter dopamine.  Serious drugs of abuse, such as heroin and
cocaine, interfere with the brain*s use of dopamine in manners that can
seriously alter an individual*s behavior.  A drug*s ability to affect
the
neural systems related to dopamine production has now become the
defining
characteristic of drugs with serious abuse potential.


According to the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, research
over the last 10 years has  proved that marijuana has no effect on
dopamine-related brain systems - unless you are an inbred Lewis rat (see
below), in which case abstention is recommended.

The discovery of a previously unknown system of cannabinoid neural
transmitters is profound. While century-old questions, such as why
marijuana is nontoxic, are finally being answered, new, fascinating
questions are emerging - as in the case of all great discoveries. In the
words of Israeli researcher Raphael Mechoulam, the man who first
isolated
the structure of THC, "Why do we have cannabinoid receptors?"

Mechoulam*s theory will resonate well with marijuana smokers in the
United States.  He observes that "Cannabis is used by man not for its
actions on memory of movement or movement coordination, but for its
actions on memory and emotions, "and asks, "Is it possible that the
main task of cannabinoid receptors . . . (is) to modify our emotions, to
serve as the links which transmit or transform or translate objective or
subjective events into perceptions and emotions?"  At a 1990 conference
on cannabinoid research in Crete, Mechoulam concluded his remarks by
saying, "Let us hope, however, that through better understanding of
cannabis chemistry in the brain, we may also approach the chemistry
of emotions."

A BRIEF HISTORY OF THC RESEARCH
The receptor breakthrough occurred in 1988 at the St. Louis University
Medical School where Allyn Howlett, William Devane and their associates
identified and characterized a cannabinoid receptor in a rat brain.  The
breakthrough has a long history leading up to it.

Major figures in American and British organic chemistry, such as Roger
Adams, Alex Todd and Sigmund Loewe, did important work in determining
the pharmacology of cannabis in the 1940s and 1950s, but their work
ground to a halt due to the disinterest cultivated by the 1937 federal
ban on marijuana.  While synthetic compounds were created which were
close to the actual compound, THC, they were not equivalent to it.  The
structure of one related chemical, cannabidiol, was determined.

After repeating the isolation of cannabidiol, in 1963 Mechoulam began
work with Yehiel Gaoni that led to the determination of the biosynthetic
pathway by which the plant synthesizes cannabinoids.  In 1964 Gaoni and
Mechoulam isolated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and a few years later they
reported the first synthesis of THC.

Following the identification of the active constituent in marijuana,
scientific research began to fill in the gaps and build on Mechoulam*s
initial breakthrough.  The neutral and acidic cannabinoids in cannabis
were isolated, and their structures were elucidated.  The absolute
configurations were determined, as was a reasonable scheme of
biogenesis.
Total synthesis of the chemical was obtained, and the structure-activity
relationship was established.  These developments laid the foundation
for
pharmacological research involving animals and man.

This work, along with observations of marijuana*s therapeutic
applications, opened up investigation into the medical properties of
cannabinoids in general and THC in particular.

Medical research into the health effects of cannabis also matured
throughout this period.  In a comprehensive 1986 article in the
Pharmacological Review, Leo Hollister of the Stanford University School
of Medicine concluded that "compared with other licit social drugs, such
as alcohol, tobacco and caffeine, marijuana does not pose greater
risks."
Hollister wondered if these currently licit drugs would have enjoyed
their popular acceptance based on our current knowledge of them.
Nonetheless, it has been widely held throughout the 1980s, as Hollister
concluded, that "Marijuana may prove to have greater therapeutic
potential than these other social drugs, but many questions still need
to be answered."

The primary question, though, was how do cannabinoids work on the brain?
By 1986, scientists were already on the slippery slope that would lead
to
the discovery of the cannabinoid receptor.  The triennial reports from
the National Institute on Drug Abuse summarizing research on marijuana
had begun to omit references to research on marijuana-related brain
damage and instead focus on brain receptor research.  A comprehensive
article by Renee Wert and Michael Raoulin was published in the
International Journal of the Addictions that year, detailing the flaws
in
all previous studies that claimed to show brain damage resulting from
marijuana use.  As Hollister independently concluded, "Brain damage has
not been proved." The reason, obviously, is that the brain was prepared
in some respects to process THC.

Also in 1986, Mechoulam put together a book reviewing this research,
Cannabinoids as Therapeutic Agents (CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL).  One
promising area of research was the use of cannabinoids as analgesics or
painkillers.  A synthetic cannabinoid named CP 55,940, 10-100 times more
potent than THC, was also developed in 1986; this was the key to the
cannabinoid receptor breakthrough.

Receptors are binding sites for chemicals in the brain, chemicals that
instruct brain cells to start, stop or otherwise regulate various brain
and body functions.  The chemicals which trigger receptors are known as
neurotransmitters.  The brain*s resident neurotransmitters are known as
endogenous ligands.  In many instances, drugs mimic these natural
chemicals working in the brain.  Scientists are just now confirming
their
determinations as to which endogenous ligands work on the cannabinoid
receptors; it is likely that the neurotransmitter which naturally
triggers cannabinoid receptors is one known as anandamide. Research
continues.

To grossly oversimplify the research involved, a receptor is determined
by exposing brain tissue to various chemicals and observing if any of
them uniquely bind to the tissue.  The search for a cannabinoid receptor
depended on the use of a potent synthetic that would allow observation
of
the binding.  CP 55,940 provided this potency, and it allowed Howlett,
Devane and their associates, working with tissue from a rat brain, to
fulfill precise scientific criteria for determining the existence of a
pharmacologically-distinct cannabinoid in brain tissue.

A year later the localization of cannabinoid receptors in human brains
and other species was determined by scientists at the National Institute
of Mental Health, led by Miles Herkenham and including Ross Johnson and
Lawrence Melvin, who had worked with Howlett and Devane on the earlier
study.

RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN
The locations of the cannabinoid receptors are most revealing of the way
THC acts on the brain, but the importance of  this determination is best
understood in comparison with the effects of other drugs on the brain.

Neurons are brain cells which process information.  Neurotransmitter
chemicals enable them to communicate with each other by their release
into the gap between the neurons. This gap is called the synapse.
Receptors are actually  proteins in neurons which are specific to
neurotransmitters, and which turn various cellular mechanisms on or off.
Neurons can have thousands of receptors for different neurotransmitters,
causing any neurotransmitter to have diverse effects in the brain.

Drugs affect the production, release or re-uptake (a regulating
mechanism) of various neurotransmitters.  They also mimic or block
actions of neurotransmitters, and can interfere with or enhance the
mechanisms associated with the receptor.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is associated with extremely
pleasurable sensations, so that the neural systems which trigger
dopamine
release are known as the "brain reward system."  The key part of this
system is identified as the mesocorticolimbic pathway, which links the
dopamine-production area with the nucleus of accumbens in the limbic
system, an area of the brain which is associated with the control of
emotion and behavior.

Cocaine, for example, blocks the re-uptake of dopamine so that the
brain,
lacking biofeedback, keeps on producing it.  Amphetamines also block the
re-uptake of dopamine, and stimulate additional production and release
of it.

Opiates activate neural pathways that increase dopamine production by
mimicking opioid-peptide neurotransmitters which increase dopamine
activity in the ventral tegmental area of the brain where the
neurotransmitter originates. Opiates work on three receptor sites, and
in
effect restrain an inhibitory amino acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, that
otherwise would slow down or halt dopamine production.

All of these substances can produce strong reinforcing properties that
can seriously influence behavior.  The rewarding properties of dopamine
are what accounts for animal studies in which animals will forgo food
and
drink or willingly experience electric shocks in order to stimulate the
brain reward system.  It is now widely held that drugs of abuse directly
or indirectly affect the brain reward system.  The key clinical test of
whether a substance is a drug of abuse potential or not is whether
administration of the drug reduces the amount of electrical stimulation
needed to produce self-stimulation response, or dopamine production.
This is an indication that a drug has reinforcing properties, and that
an
individual*s use of the drug can lead to addictive and other harmful
behavior.

To be precise, according to the Office of Technological Assessment
(OTA):
"The capacity to produce reinforcing effects is essential to any drug
with significant abuse potential."

Marijuana should no longer be considered a serious drug abuse because,
as summarized by the OTA: "Animals will not self-administer THC in
controlled studies . . . . Cannabinoids generally do not lower the
threshold needed to get animals to self-stimulate the brain regard
system, as do other drugs of abuse." Marijuana does not produce
reinforcing effects.

The definitive experiment which measures drug-induced dopamine
production utilizes microdialysis is live, freely-moving rats.  Brain
microdialysis has proven that opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine
and alcohol all affect dopamine production, whereas marijuana does not.

This latest research confirms and explains Hollister*s 1986 conclusion
about cannabis and addiction: "Physical dependence is rarely encountered
in the usual patterns, despite some degree of tolerance that may
develop."

Most important, the discoveries of Howlett and Devane, Herkenham and
their associates demonstrate that the cannabinoid receptors do not
influence the dopamine reward system.

CANNABINOID RECEPTORS
Research has enabled scientists to know which portions of the brain
control various body functions, and this knowledge has been used to
explain the pharmacological properties of drugs that activate receptor
sites in the brain.

There is a dense concentration of cannabinoid binding sites in the basal
ganglia and the cerebellum of the base-brain, both of which affect
movement and coordination.  This discovery will aid in determining the
actual physical mechanism by which THC affects spasticity and provides
therapeutic benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis and other
spastic disorders.

While there are cannabinoid receptors in the ventromedial striatum and
basal ganglia which are areas  associated with dopamine production, no
cannabinoid receptors have been found in dopamine-producing neurons, and
as mentioned above, no reinforcing properties have been demonstrated in
animal studies.

There is one study by Gardner and Lowinson, involving inbred Lewis rats,
in which doses of THC lowered the amount of electrical stimulation
required to trigger the brain reward system. However, no one has been
able to replicate the results with any other species of rat, or any
other
animal.  The finding is believed to be the result of some inbred genetic
variation in the inbred species, and is both widely mentioned in the
literature and disregarded.

According to Herkenham and his associates, "There are virtually no
reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans.  The safety  reflects the
paucity of receptors in medullary nuclei that mediate respiratory and
cardiovascular functions."  This is also why cannabinoids have great
promise as analgesics or painkillers, in that they do not depress the
function of the heart or the lungs. In this respect, they are far
superior to opiates, which decrease the entire physiological system
because the receptors are all over the medulla as well as the brain.

Marijuana is distinguished from most other illicit drugs by the
locations
of its brain-receptor sites for two predominant reasons: (1) The lack of
receptors in the medulla significantly reduces the possibility of
accidental, or even deliberate, death from THC, and (2) the lack of
receptors in the mesocorticolimbic pathway significantly reduces the
risks of addiction and serious physical dependence.  As a therapeutic
drug, these features are God*s greatest gifts.

THE CHEMISTRY OF EMOTIONS
Mechoulam regrets that more has not been done in the therapeutic
application of THC.  In a 1986 interview with the International Journal
of the Addictions, he said that, "Knowing what I know today, I would
have worked more on the therapeutic aspects of cannabis.  This area
apparently needs a major push that is has not had up till now,
particularly given that it has a therapeutic potential.  One of the
reasons that it has not been pushed was than most pharmaceutical
companies years ago were afraid to get into that field. Companies were
*burnt* working on amphetamines and LSD. . . . They are afraid of
notoriety."

Clearly, cannabis acts on coordination of movement by way of the
receptors in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, and on memory by way of
the receptors in the limbic system*s hippocampus, which "gates"
information during memory consolidation.  Mechoulam believes that in
humans these actions "are rather marginal."

"Cannabis," he states, "is used . . . for its actions on mood and
emotion." The key to understanding the reason for the presence of
cannabinoid receptors in the human brain lies in understanding the role
of the receptors in the limbic system, which has a central role in the
mechanisms which govern behavior and emotions.

The limbic system coordinates activities between the visceral base-brain
and the rest of the nervous system. "We know next to nothing on the
chemistry of emotions, "Mechoulam instructs.  It is his hope that future
research on the role of cannabinoid receptors in the brain will shed
light on this new area of investigation and reflection.

THE FUTURE OF MARIJUANA LAWS
Advances in neurobiology are redefining the scientific basis for
addiction.  These advances have important ramifications for addiction
treatment, and for the treatment of numerous organic diseases and
conditions.  More importantly for marijuana users, these advances in
neurobiology will ultimately force changes in the law.

The law is constantly being modified in response to technological
changes.  The passage of the Controlled Substances Act in  1972 was in
part due to a greater understanding of drug abuse brought about by the
medical research of the time.

The law instituted a policy by which regulation and criminal penalties
regarding controlled substances were to be correlated with the
harmfulness of the substance.  Specifically, the law lists the "actual
or
relative potential for abuse" as the first matter to be considered in
determining the appropriate scheduling of a drug.  Schedule I is for
drugs which have a "high potential for abuse."

While the scheduling of marijuana and its subsequent availability for
research and medical use was the subject of a 22-year unsuccessful court
battle spearheaded by the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws, the question of marijuana*s abuse potential was never
addressed during the litigation and related proceedings.  The suit over
medical marijuana sought to reschedule marijuana as a Schedule II drug,
which also implies a "high potential for abuse."  This made the abuse
question irrelevant to the court proceedings.

However, the abuse question is the pre-eminent issue in attempts to
reform marijuana laws, and it is the weak link upon which the entirety
of marijuana prohibition rests.  The most recent research indicates that
marijuana does not have a high potential for abuse, especially relative
to other scheduled drugs such as heroin, cocaine, sedatives and
amphetamines.

The medical-marijuana petition was rejected by the administrator of the
DEA because of the lack of scientific studies detailing marijuana*s
medical value.  The court appeal essentially concerned whether or not
this was a reasonable standard in light of the government*s historic
disinterest in funding such studies. While courts have ruled that DEA
can
rely on research studies, or the lack thereof, in its decision-making
about the scheduling of marijuana, they have not ruled on the actual
issues which determine the proper legal scheduling of marijuana.

The discovery of cannabinoid receptor sites, and their relevance to the
understanding of the pharmacology of THC in the brain, provides the
basis
for a new challenge to the legitimacy of marijuana*s Schedule I status,
a
pivotal event in marijuana*s eventual legalization.


The architects of marijuana prohibition have long maintained that
tolerance to cannabis means the same thing as tolerance to addictive
drugs like cocaine and heroin--that users need more and more to get
high,
driving them to crime and desperation. Now, the federal government's own
research indicates that precisely the opposite is true. Science has
finally
caught on to what tokers have known all along: With marijuana tolerance,
you have to smoke less to get high! HIGH TIMES correspondent Jon
Gettman explains the latest findings and how they discredit the
government's drug policy.

One of the safest qualities of THC, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, the
primary psychoactive substance in marijuana, is the natural limit the
body
places on the drug's effects.

It has long mystified scientists how most individuals can consume
enormous
quantities of marijuana with few or no obvious ill effects. But the
explanation will not surprise regular marijuana users.

Early researchers were often alarmed by this, believing that this
tolerance was a warning sign of dependence or addiction. Tolerance
generally describes the condition of requiring larger doses of a drug to
attain consistent effects. While tolerance to marijuana has never
exactly
fit the classic definition, some form of tolerance to pot does develop.

Regular users of marijuana frequently claim that this tolerance reduces
troublesome side effects, such as loss of coordination. They also claim
that tolerance to marijuana develops without risk of dependence.

Cynics have argued that tolerance to marijuana is proof of dependence,
and
proof that the drug is too dangerous to be used safely and responsibly.

Science has finally proven otherwise. The cynics have been wrong, the
pot-smokers have been right. Tolerance to marijuana is not an indication
of danger or dependence.

This conclusion also adds credence to anecdotal accounts of marijuana's
therapeutic benefits by patients suffering from serious illnesses.

Your Brain is Programmed to Process Pot

The recent discovery of a cannabinoid receptor system in the human brain
has revolutionized research on marijuana and cannabinoids, and
definitively proven that marijuana use does not have a dependence or
addiction liability. ("Marijuana and the Human Brain, Mar. '95 HT).
Marijuana, it turns out, affects brain chemistry in a qualitatively
different way than addictive drugs.

Drugs of abuse such as heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol and
nicotine
affect the production of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter which
chemically activates switches in the brain that produce extremely
pleasurable feelings. Drugs that affect dopamine production produce
addiction because the human brain is genetically conditioned to adjust
behavior to maximize dopamine production. This chemical process occurs
in the middle-brain, in an area called the striatum, which also controls
various aspects of motor control and coordination.

Dr. Miles Herkenham of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
and
his research teams have made the fundamental discoveries behind these
findings, and finally contradicted well-known marijuana cynic Gabriel
Nahas of Columbia University. Supported in the 1980s by the antidrug
group Parents Research Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE), Nahas has
long argued that marijuana affects the middle-brain, justifying its
prohibition.

Now Herkenham and his associates have proven that marijuana has no
direct
effect on dopamine production in the striatum, and that most of the
drug's
effects occur in the relatively "new" (in evolutionary terms) region of
the brain--the frontal cerebral cortex. There is now biological evidence
that far from being the "gateway" to abusive drugs, marijuana is instead
the other way to get high--the safe way.

THC: Dose And Effect

The effects of marijuana share certain properties with all the other
psychoactive drugs--stimulants, sedatives, tranquilizers and
hallucinogens. Scientists are just now figuring out how marijuana users
manipulate dosage and tolerance to manage those effects.

Small doses of THC provide stimulation, followed by sedation. Large
doses
of THC produce a mild hallucinogenic effect, followed by sedation and/or
sleep. The effects of mild "hypnogogic" states produced by THC are often
undetected, contributing to mood variations from gregariousness to
introspection.

The effects of marijuana can be sorted into four categories. First,
there
are modest physical effects, such as a slight change in heart rate or
blood pressure and changes in body temperature. Tolerance develops to
these effects with familiarity and/or regular use.

Tolerance next develops to the depressant effects of marijuana,
particularly to its effects on motor coordination. However, tolerance
to these effects depends on the quality of the marijuana consumed as
well as the frequency of use. THC is one of several cannabinoids in
marijuana. While it is the only cannabinoid to produce the psychoactive
or stimulative effects, another cannabinoid, named cannabinol (CBN),
produces only the depressant effects. CBN is generally present in low-
potency marijuana, or very old marijuana in which the THC has decayed;
it
accounts for the generally undesirable effects of bad pot. While
cannabinol gets someone "stoned," THC gets them "high."

After a while, tolerance develops to even the stimulative effects of
marijuana. Experienced users learn that there is an outer limit to how
high they can get. Paradoxically, this limit can only be exceeded by
lower consumption.

Patients who require marijuana for medical purposes generally discover
what dose provides steady maintenance of therapeutic benefits and
tolerance to the side effects, both depressant and stimulative.

Marijuana Tolerance: Equilibrium, not Addiction

Research into drug tolerance is in its infancy. There are actually three
forms of tolerance. Dispositional tolerance is produced by changes in
the way the body absorbs a drug. Dynamic tolerance is produced by
changes in the brain caused by an adaptive response to the drug's
continued presence, specifically in the receptor sites affected by the
drug. Behavioral tolerance is produced by familiarity with the
environment in which the drug is administered. "Familiarity" and
"environment" are two alternative terms for what Timothy Leary called
"set" and "setting" - the subjective emotional/mental factors that the
user brings to the drug experience and the objective external factors
imposed by their surroundings. Tolerance to any drug can be produced by
a
combination of these and other mechanisms.

Brain receptor sites act as switches in the brain. The brain's
neurotransmitters, or drugs which mimic them, throw the switches. The
basic theory of tolerance is that repeated use of a drug wears out the
receptors, and makes it difficult for them to function in the drug's
absence. Worn-out receptors were supposed to explain the connection of
tolerance to addiction. This phenomenon has been associated with chronic
use of benzodiazepines (Valium, Prozac, etc.), for example, but not with
cannabinoids.

An alternative hypothesis about how dynamic tolerance to marijuana
operates involves receptor "down-regulation," in which the body adjusts
to chronic exposure to a drug by reducing the number of receptor sites
available for binding. A 1993 paper published in Brain Research by
Angelica Oviedo, John Glowa and Herkenham indicates that tolerance to
cannabinoids results from receptor down-regulation. This, as we shall
see, is good news. It means that marijuana tolerance is actually the
brain's mechanism to maintain equilibrium.

The NIMH Tolerance Study

Herkenham's team studied six groups of rats. They compared changes in
behavioral responses with changes in the density of receptor sites in
six
areas of the brain. One group of rats was the control group, which were
given the "vehicle" solution the other five rat groups received, but
without any cannabinoids. In other words, the control rats got a
placebo;
the other rats got high. A second group was given cannabidiol (CBD), a
non-psychoactive cannabinoid. The third group was given delta-9 THC.
Three other groups were given different doses of a synthetic cannabinoid
called CP-55,940, with a far greater ability to inhibit movement than
delta-9 THC. CP-55-940, a synthetic isomer of THC, was developed as an
experimental analgesic.

First, the study determined the effects of a single dose of each
compound
compared to the undrugged control group. Rats receiving the placebo and
the CBD displayed no sign of effects. The animals receiving the

	example: i tried to email pete yesterday and got a message about my
server blah blah blah so i went in and got all my options straight and i
couldn't send my reply to his message.. which, btw pete, i wanted ta say
danks for dat message about your carnegie events, i will be in touch.
you brightened my dismal school day (akron U). 
	I'd like ta know more about the broadcasting aspect of the event, esp
VIDEO. i wanna know if i can broadcast live on the net!!! and i wanna
know about radio broadcast. more on dat later.
	ya gave me different slants on things, good things to think about.
danks


	example 2: mizzie (i think)
		i got your message 30 minutes ago on a terminal THAT WOULDN"T PRINT.
so i decided to switch, print some aclu stuff, and reply too. well.....
not only couldn't i print on tha otha comp, i logged onto my email and
it said "no new messages on server". WHAT ???? I HAD 6fuckinTEEN
messages 30 mins ago. FUCK DAT. so i glanced @ your message ONCE and i
haven't been able to retreive it. if i could get on this computer beside
me (the one i usually log onto, the one wit my old mail+ new mail
probably dumped on C drive till the end of tha month) i could reply TO
YOU. but this lil comp geekk is on it. no, i'm really just pissed that
my email is fukt. he's not really a geek. he's just been on the computer
BEFORE i got in here and hasn't got off yet (even tho i made an
appearance to a class for 1/2 hr and was in here an HOUR waitin before
dat tryin every computer.... EXCEPT THAT ONE. but that's besides the

	HI mizzie (?), yep this is the keane you cats came to that nite. I
never finished watchin lion king (hahaha) i went upstairs and my clock
was fast (like 4:20ish) so i had ta take care of it..;) yep we watched
that NASTY 20/20 expose on "raves". i'm so glad i watched that (this guy
beside me is writing a fuckin program, no wonder he's been here so long.
fucker) because before 20/20 i didn't know that a raver (ie me) is a
13-17 yr old kid rebelling thru drugs. i also found out that we have a
secret network using "CODEWORDS" and the "IN-TER-NET". ooooohhhh. scary
mean bad machines. (all this from old ass Bah-bah Wah-wah ..err..
barbera walters who probably cant program her newfangled VCR. much less

	yea, we had fun dat nite. i don't quite remember who you were (did ya

	I feel good that you remember who i was.. i'm wrackin my brains tryin
ta remember you.. did ya have blonde hair..ummm..striped shist maybe?
came with another friend and were sittin on my black couch (not the

I'd like ta say that we akron cats thank EVERYONE for showin interest
in this and supportin the scene. we were all wonderin a few months back
how many people were still down wit the scene (and not the drugs), and
now we know there are LOTS.

	I'd also like ta inform everyoone that the reason the 1st spot was
closed (pretty much before it started) was because cops found ONE person
with 4 eigths OF WEED!!! (that's a half oz. for the fraction impaired).
so dats where it all started. PRETTY SHITTYSALTYSHEISTY, eh? 

	NOW FACTS AND DATES:
		1- i would like ta gather in fornt of APD on
SATURDAY                       MARCH 1st at 4:20 pm. 
	
	however, a friend of mine (down wit the scene much longer than i and
MUCH more experienced in organizing) suggested that would be too soon.
he thinks we can get 200-300 kids down here and make a REAL LOUD
STATEMENT "DON'T FUCK WITH US". more or less. March 1st is 1 wk after
that ptbgh party (don't remember the name) which would be a great
opportunity to get the word out to all our pittsburgh peoples that
travelled up here and got DISRESPECTED by our city's police (wazzup pike
an taj an other nice people i forgot, dis is Keane, maryellen's roomie). 

	anyone from pittsburgh, is one week enough time to get word out via
printed flyers to get cats up here?

	MORE FACTS/IDEAS:
		1-RENTAL VANS RENTAL VANS RENTAL VANS. i am desperately asking
promoters/activists of THEIR scenes that wanna represent the cause of us
standing up for our rights ands deliviring the APD a message to
contribut a few dollars (20-30) to renta vans or carpool w/cats w/vans.
I'm gonna come outta MY personal bank account $200 to pull this off. Any
money left over from me and my friends will be sent to interested areas
to rent vans to provide transportation. (allotting $ for spot + sounds.
but we may get those for free when we explain the cause)

		2-AFTERGATHERING.
			no i don't expect everyone to bust ass an gas money ta get up ta
AKRON only to say "danks" and send yall home. we wanna have a potluck
dinner followed by a free party. and if we CAN'T get the spot i'm lookin
at for free (or a bill or two), then i will not take any spot charging
over $3 a head. i will organize like about 5 different houseparties for
cats ta chill at. but i'm aimin for a free get together so it'll
probably be on. remember not to leave flyers layin around since cops
CONFISCATED them at the Brewsky's closing (they asked us about some info
line thing and said "is this some sort of code word?" so they're HIP
now, they know the LINGO and our CODEWORDS. lameasses)
 
		3-THE POTLUCK DINNER 
			(i see ravers' eyes lightin up cuz .. jus like me.. ya haven't eaten
since ya stopped at the gasstation ..some time yesterday) will be run
like this, ya bring food = ya can eat. period. we probably won't want,
oh, say, 30 boxes of uncooked macaroni an cheese, unless we're needin
groceries dat bad dat week. but we won't be. but if anyone wants ta
bring canned goods or food we'll take it an donate or eat it. either way
it will help poor people (maybe 20/20 should do sumpin on poverty in the
rave community). so i'm jus sayin don't feel pressed ta bring food (taco
bell is EVERYWHERE .. kinda like god), but don't expect ta eat for free.
we'd love ta do it, but can only do so much. well, dat was long enough.


		4-BROADCASTING
			anyone knowin how to broadcast on short wave (pirate) radio or how to
get the equipment (free, or cheap, but FUNCTIONAL), please contact me
kat@uakron.edu.
			anyone knowin how to broadcast over internet please email me an let
me know if it's possible for cheap or not. i'll hook ya up wit some
local cats good at that computer stuff. 
			anyone with video equipment, cameras, etc IS ENCOURAGED TO COME. more
cameras = less BLATENT harrassment as the pork err PEACE officers can be
easily ID'd. (at club gargoyles as they harrassed people in the parking
lot they stood with their arms folded over their badges and lil
nametags.fuckers.)
	
	We've already started taking steps to a) have it recorded and send it
to public access cable so we circulate a POSITIVE (non-negative) image
of "ravers". b) i'm also contacting MANY local radio stations and c)our
newspapers to cover the event. so get geared an wear your colors BOLD.
have things to say if they ask questions.


		5-ACLU
			okay, i wrote a letter to our Cleveland ACLU affiliate. i'm enclosing
letters + email printouts of personal accounts of the night to them. so
if ya had a run in with a PWA (pig wit an attitude) in one of the 3
parking lots of the places that got closed, email me. ESPECIALLY OUT OF
TOWN CATS. doesn't it make ya mad that ya spent gas money + tickets ta
come to our town, our SCENE and that is how our city people treat their
guests? or write to

				Christine Link
				1266 W 6th st, 2nd floor
				Cleveland, OH 44113
				(216) 781-6276

	   she needs to know    1) what rights you feel were violated (i.e.
peaceful assembly, cultural discrimination)
				2) facts of YOUR situation (i.e. jus say what happened, even if it
was only a rude cop pushin ya out the door)
				3) individuals/agencies you're complaining about (i.e. akron police
dept)
				4) your return address (email is fine) and name an # 
				5) documentation backing your facts, and what you would like the
affiliate to do (ya don't hafta do this because i've already done it and
will be using your letters as MY evidence. I'm requesting the ACLU to
give pointers for the protest, file charges with the APD, send me
literature on peaceful assembly and curfew, and SET UP AN EMAIL ACCOUNT.
so if ya want sumpin different feel free ta write it)


		6- FLYER
			preflyers will be out by Mon or WED. if ya live in akron, kent area
DON'T leave stacks sittin around at businesses. this is a hand to hand
thing. i don't want cops stoppin this before it starts because someone
has a bag in their car. 20 minutes prior. i wanna show up like
BAM!!!!!!! and drop it on their doorstep. LEGALLY.

			actual flyer may have a little blank square on the back right corner
and a lil #2 put-put pencil taped to it. this lil square is for
badge/car numbers. if they hide them.. ASK THEM PERSISTENTLY!!! do the
broken record player thing."duhh, i yam only a dumb ole 21 yr old. whas
yo name an badge numbah?" BY LAW THEY GOTTA GIVE IT TO YA. but, this
brings me to my las little ditty...

		7-POLICE TRICKS
			any time you talk to a cop or they talk to you you can BET they will
call you "faggott" or "waste" or l;augh at your peircing or worse. we've
all heard it all. just remember that we don't HATE them as people, they
just need to be SHOWN what we're about. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND THEY
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. They will show us (by example) hate and
prejudice and personal disrespect. that's not our game. don't fall into
it (it is OH SO EASY), show them that we wouldn't treat a human being
that way. let them know the hate is THEM. the violence is THEM. True, i
think people who pick fist-fights are ignorant emberrassments to human
beings, It is WRONG AND DEMEANING AND SOLVES NOTHING. it shows no
respect for PEOPLE and is quite ADOLESCENT. so when i've been harrassed
with those tactics it takes ALL of my energy not to come down on the
officers with a message of jah condemning such vile devlish men. i jus
tell myself he is just lost, he doesn't know. he never had a CHANCE to
experience what we have because this society keeps people separated and
fighting. SO GET MAD AS FUCK, but realize that the asshole officer is a
SYMPTOM of the disease. GET MAD AS FUCK at the disease (mind control,
"social narcotics", ethno/egocentrism, HATE), not the victims. Even
hitler's SS soldiers, despite all their killing, were family men
BRAINWASHED SINCE GRADESCHOOL TO RECITE HIS SAYINGS (kinda like the
pledge of allegiance).

		have faith, hope, that we will reach THE WORLD.

I see how it goes, I'm the one who wanted to come to the computer lab
and you insisted on coming along.  Why are you such a dork?  You come in
and rip my computer away but don't worry I'll get you back.  We've got
along way to go in this semester pal!  I'd watch your back from now on. 
See ya when I see ya.

this is just another reminder to everyone that i am ALWAYS
buying older electronic cds.  i am especially interested in early
breakbeat/jungle/happy hardcore/darkside/gabber type stuff.  i'll buy 
older singles or compilations or whatever, so if you have anything
that you are willing to sell, let me know about it.  i am really
only interested in cd's with a few exceptions for vinyl.
i'd buy music by the following on viny:
=spring heel jack
=moby (anything by richard hall)
=prince
=luna-c (anything chris howell)
=justin time (anything by matt carlton)
=altern8

thanks for you time.          p.s.-if you have, or know of a place
                          that has some of spring heel
love,                        jack's early cd singles, please
ryu                          let me know.  thanks.

Subject: {pb-cle} ** Tekknobox 2.7 Released **
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Sorry for the possible spam, but I thought some of you would like to know.

TekknoBOX 2.7 is now available and ready for download.

TekknoBOX 2.7 is a MIDI sequencer for Windows, geared and designed for the
production of house, tekkno, hip hop and almost any genre of dance music.
Unlike traditional sequencers, tekknobox is a non linear pattern based
system, based on the way the Roland TR-909 and 808 sequence.  For both, the
professional producer and anyone interested in getting involved in producing
phat beats and wicked b-lines, tekknobox is the easiest system to get those
tracks laid out and produced.  Special care has also gone into the design to
make it an invaluable tool for live performance, with many playback features
and options geared specifically to that.

Features of 2.7:

- Several major bug fixes that fix Runtime 202 errors and GPFs that some 
  users reported.  Anyone and everyone should have no problem running this
  version of the box.
- Swing quantization from 1 to 99%, essential for adding that funk to house
  and disco beats.
- Unique Clip Library to store and manage often used pattern clips.
- 32 step pattern based sequencer
- Phrase sequencing that allows the stringing together of patterns into
  sub-sequences for easy playback and recording.
- New pattern management and manipulation functions
- Special support for AWE-32 soundcards and Novation bassStation and rack 
  mounted synth modules
- Export to MIDI
- New and improved alien disco starship lookin' interface
- ... lots and lots of other goodies.

Tekknobox requires a 486/33 or better running either Windows 3.1/3.11 or
Windows95.  8 megs of RAM is a minimum and you have to have some sort of
soundcard to make it go.

This software is not just for the serious gearhead, if you've always wanted
to try to make beats, give the box a whirl - I think you'll be surprised at
how easy it is to produce and design your own rhythms.

Another note, this software isn't produced by some company trying to "break"
into the "dance" market, it's written and produced by an underground event
promoter and house deejay from minneapolis who has been around for quite
some time.  TekknoBOX itself is a project that started well over 2 years ago.

Again, sorry for the spam :)

I ran into a lot of interesting information while collecting data
for my 'legalize LSD' website:

The following can be viewed even better at:
http://www.alltheway.com/html/ergot.html

The first major outbreak of dancing mania was in Aix-la-Chapelle in July
of 1374. A group of people were seen to
  dance uncontrollably in the streets, foaming at the mouth and
screaming of wild visions. They kept on dancing
  until they collapsed from exhaution, but even then they flailed about
in agony until forcefuly restrained. The
  dancing caught on, and spread rapidly throughout France and the Low
Countries. 

  Crowds gathered wherever the dancers were. Religious ceremonies were
held in an attempt to exorcise the
  demons causing the mania. People prayed to St. Vitus for aid, and he
soon became the patron saint of the
  dancers.2 The mania became an anti-clerical protest when dancers in
Liege began cursing the priests of
  that city. Protesters following this lead took over a few monasteries
and towns, but had no real effect. 

  The mania peaked in 1418 in Straussburg. Dancers filled the steets
around the clock, accompanied by musicians.
  The presence of musicians not unusual; it was widely believed that the
order inherent in music was a cure not
  only for ailments of the spirit, but of the flesh as well. In the High
Middle Ages, the power of music
  was extended by scholars such as Johannes de Grocheio, Master of Arts
in Paris in the early 14th C., to include
  the ability to restrain the vices typically associated with the
various social classes. In other words, music was a
  cure for the ills of society as well. Thus the dancing mania was
treated by the playing of music, to control the wild
  gyrations of In Straussburg, so many people had either been afflicted
with the dancing mania, or caught up in the
  dancing, or trying to help, or gawking from the sidelines, that the
town was brought at least once to a complete
  standstill. ...

  The dancing mania, especially as described in Aix-la-Chapelle, may
have had a physical cause. The descriptions
  of the symptoms of some of the sufferers leads to another hypothesis,
that the manic dancers (at least some of
  them) were victims of ergot poisoning, or ergotism. Ergotism, which
was known in the Middle Ages as "St.
  Anthony's Fire", is a toxic condition in humans and animals which
inadvertently eat rye and other grasses
  parasitized by Claviceps purpurea (ergot). This small brown fungus
produces an amazing array of dangerous
  chemicals, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Symptoms of
ergotism may include psychotic delusions,
  nervous spasms, spontaneous abortion, convlusions, and gangrene. LSD
in particular causes intensely colored
  hallucinations, perhaps explaining the visions of some of the dancers,
like those who claimed to have seen the
  heavens open up to reveal Christ enthroned with the Virgin Mary.
Ergotism is also frequenly fatal, and could have
  been the cause of the death of the dancers described in the early 17th
C. Straussburg Chronicle.

ok.  so Newsweek says so so its gotsta be true.  We're gonna make it
big kids! So, now is our chance.  I'm serious about this, too.  What
DO WE REALLY WANT!?  We've got the power here, as a large group of
intelligent (or semi-not-brain-dead) individuals, we have a
responsibility to let those who count know what we REALLY want.  In
other words, we think we have a good thing going, 'eh?  So, when the
powers that be try to steal our good thing and make only lots of $$
with it, how do we want them to do it?  What makes our "scene" really
what it is?

Please answer this question:

What are five things that define the state of electronic dance music
gatherings that we cannot live without?

The way I look at it I can't live without five things:

1) Diverse, interesting, ground breaking, danceable electronic music
2) mind-blowing visual imagery provided by lights, projections, etc.
3) clear, loud, booming sound systems
4) beatmatched vinyl, without the typical verse chorus verse format
5) free cold water

so, what are the five things _you_ CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT? :) 

they are listening.  the time is now to let them know how NOT to fuck
it all up.  lets do it.

Right on frank!
If they are gonna rape the scene, they might as well have a little
advice on the least disturbing way to do it.
I pretty much agree with your 5 rankings, though I would put the sound
system above the lighting and visuals.  And as for free cold
water....well, it is a dream of all ravers..but hell, we can't even seem 
to tackle that ourselves. 
Personally I am willing to pay a buck for a bottle of water, so long as
there is a free way to refill it.  I think I would replace it on the list
with a somewhat non-judgemental environment where one can feel free to
express themselves as we love to do...through dance 8)

i'll agree with 1 and 3, definintely. 5 is another good one - paying for 
water seems to me to be just stupid considering that all the bartender is 
doing is turning the knob on the tap. thats 3 for me (i dont really care 
too much about elaborate light systems, and good music beatmatched goes 
without saying). so my other 2:

4) fun people to dance with with whom i have something in common. ideally 
folks that i can talk to about something other than raving.
5) hmm.. hard one. id have to say an overall creative experience.

imho i strongly suspect that most of the "original ravers" in this

with their version of a rave. anyone have any ideas what that will be?

Hey everyone... just wanted to let you all know that I still have a 
buncha tickets for Yahoo... but I kinda have a problem.  I don't have 
email right now.  Well, I have my account, but my phoneline is down at 
home until further notice.  I'm doing this at a friend's house, but 
unfortunately, I can't get here on a regular basis until the party... 

So... hrm... I dunno.  Ugh.  I was gonna write this and give everyone my 
phone number, but that would be pointless since it doesn't work.  :/  
Hrm.  Well, I guess just keep writing me email if you want tix... but if 
I don't respond asap, give me a day or two to respond so I can get to a 
comp. lab to check my email.  :)

That's all... Miss you guys on vrave... :(  14 more days!  :) :) :) :)

evolved versions of rave dont include the word rave. look what happened in
new york. new york is very post rave; its underground music scene (i guess
the "orgianl ravers") like goa, hate house and the word techno. a lot of
them have turned back into skaheadz, punkheadz, or hardcore cats, perhaps
lounge cats because that scene was more underground.. also a lot of
"original ravers" got burnt out, and consider raves as a phase in their
life.

my biggest concerns are about our _underground_ growth. its getting so easy
for cops to take advantage of our scene. its getting so easy for kids to go
to a rave , because theyre mostly in clubs and have exact directions on the
infoline, and they have access to cars to get to a party 3 hours away..

therefore its become more of a place to be for the newskoolers..less of a
spiritual experierence... less of a trek. more of a fashion show. its also
very hard to be an underground promoter these days i would guess, no? you
cant pick a raver out by the style anymore, becuase the old styles have
been posed out.

i know somethings gonna happen maybe it already has, that defines the
boundaries between underground parties and rave. i guess it will have to do
with communication..maybe we will have to start speaking in code...the most
underground parties dont even have flyers for them. ive seen promotional
tests done in pittsburgh and penn state that show we dont need flyers, or
even internet promotion. word of mouth is one way, computer disks are
another...

i keep seeing too many young people kicking the "dance smashes " in their
car, and its getting really really popular. its a question of whether we
really want to associate with these people. the bigger parties ive been to
it wasnt so easy to walk up to someone dancing next to you and have a
decent conversation...also for a lot of clubgoers, its more about sex than
love. our music has been commercialized by putting very seductive images to
the sounds and therefore comes with what its been advertised with.

of course, where you fit in has to do with the music you follow and are
influenced by. right now in our area, i believe that hip hop is the most
underground, beacuse it entails the highest form of communication, through
slang and poetry. when ravers start learning how to freestyle and
breakdance, and mc their own life...when we lose the time to think about
what others think of us....thats when we evolve...okay i gotta run.

grog shop that night (we even got pulled over for basically no   
reason along the way there - gotta luv coventry cops :P ). i even
missed out on the house party in glenville saturday night cuz 
christa dragged me to some dive bar, Larry's, to hang out w/ her
friends sara (from indy), phil (who's dance performance at the   
osu winter dance concert wuz truly inspirational for more reasons
than one for me), and dave (from cleveland)...you should've come
out after all jeff/stuff, if anything to see the osu dance concert,
it wuz well worth the trip...btw walt/melissa (i lost yur e-mail 
addy) do you think you can give the superfly flyers to christa
to bring up to cleveland since i missed picking them up for you
in glenville...i wuz really bummed cuz i really wanted to see ben
spin since i missed him in toledo the night before (becuz i had to
work saturday morning)...anyone go wanna spill a review 'bout that?
did rob rage show up? i called jenny up & told him to go to the 
party & bring his records if he had time...oh yah, he wanted me 
to let y'all know to keep march 15th clear on your calender cuz 
he'll be doing a li'l party in columbus on that date featuring

	Greetings,
		First off I have to apologize to those who sent me email 
for not getting back to you right off.  I'm dealing with alot of email 
lately so it's hard to reply to everyone.  For anyone who's sent me both 
an email and money for tickets, I have recieved it.  Also about 
personalized stickers for the ticket/badges, the plan is to have a little 
table set up at the party to hand these out when you come in.  I will 
mail everyone their tickets of course but it won't include the sticker.  
We're doing this because it's easier to make up a whole bunch of stickers 
at once rather than individually, so if we get all the requests in soon 
we can have them made up and waiting for you at the party.
	Also another new bit of info - Phil (baconboy (pmb6@cornell.edu)) is
selling tickets to the toronto netters.  We wanna meet the toronto crew so 
y'all drive over to Rochester on the 22nd, eh?
	I hope everyone is getting as excited about this party as I am.  
We are now two weekends away from YAHOO and everything is coming together 
very nicely.  It's been a long time since we've all seen each other in 
the same place at the same time and I really like to think of this as our 
big cyberfamily reunion.  I'm anxious to meet all the new people and I 
can't wait to hear our dj's.  You have all partied with them in the past and 
for many of us this will be the first time we'll have the chance to hear 
them spin.  
	I'll be reposting the YAHOO flyer again, the only change being the 
addition of Phil in toronto on the list of ticket distributors.  Remeber 
to buy your tickets soon.  A number of smart folks have already bought 
their tickets but not enough to fund some of the tech-tricks we'd hoped for, 
so if you know you're going, buy your tickets now!!.. As I said, I'll post 
the flyer with all that info right after this message.  
	
-Caz

What can't I live without in the 'scene?  Hmm..  let's see..

1.  techno music that I've never heard before (if I hear 'Firestarter' 
	one more time...)
2.  people with similiar interests that I can relate to
3.  the noticable lack of invectives I get because of my clothing
4.  the ability to prove that I can't dance to save my life, but no one 
	notices (thank you, one and all) :)
5.  the noticable lack of alcohol (ever been to a dance where they 
	brought kegs?  really not fun)

Visuals really don't do much for me (my eyes are closed most of the 
time).  Though, if anyone ever brought a projection TV and a tape of the 
Lawnmower Man...

Amen to that.  I've met quite a few ravers who have rather eclectic 
interests.  It's not just a dance party, it's an otaku's paradise...

I don't know about you, but I'm still a big fan of the old-school house 
parties.  Maybe the scene should get back to its roots.

Yeah.  I got it too, but not from this list.  I recieved it 
point-to-point for some odd reason.  Maybe someone got a hold of the 
memberlist for this 'list and is being a git.

I agree with all the below but not the above.. techno will thrive without the
rave scene it already does... Mos producers and most Consumers of the music
arnt ravers.. Ravers consume more Clothing and Etc.. then they do music..
Mos ravers consume more mix tapes.... largest Consumer of techno music is
another techno Musican who morslty arnt ravers or go to raves.....
 but the reasons below are good points esp # 4 for me too ;)

Very true.

> arnt ravers.. Ravers consume more Clothing and Etc.. then they do music..

But, then who does buy most of the music?  I can't be the only one..

Actually, I really do mean new music.  Every time I go to a rave, I hear 
tracks that I've never heard before.  That's what I love:  the endless 
variety.  For me, there's no 'been there, grooved to/spun that,' because 
there's always something new to listen to.

Hi everyone, 

I posted here a few weeks ago..

(I'm in the band Skylab2000. We're based in Los Angeles and we play west coast
trancy-acid-funky-breaks stuff with plenty of wobbly acidic 303. More
importantly, we play 100% live and play at parties all over the country.)

Two things:

First, our new *fast* web site is up. The URL is now very simple:

http://skylab2000.com

Check it out.

Second, I'll be at Winter Music and will have plenty of our tapes and promo 
kits to give away.. I don't kmow if we are playing anywhere during the show,
but I'll be hanging around swimming pools and bars for four days having fun 
and meeting people.

If you are gonna be there, please email me, so I can add you to the list of
people to try and hook up with. I'll send you email later with my cellphone 
or hotel number so I can give you a tape and promo kit.

peace

My name is Gyrate (Gabe James) and I am looking for LIVE PA bookings
for the year of 1997.  Recently I have been performing live in the
Southwestern United States as well as Florida.  Currently, I have a
promotional 12" release on DJ Huggie and Chagia's "Global Energy Musik"
(LA).  This 1997 print is an advance copy containing my track "Electric
Storm" and is strictly in promotion to reach distributors, magazines,
and DJ's worldwide.

        I would like to reach interested promoters who are willing and
able to book my live PA for thier upcoming events.

        Please contact me at the following:                     

                E-Mail: <gyrate@cris.com>

   I forget who wanted to know their rights to assemble and if it is legal
or not, I have the answers.

  A: The government may place "time, place, and manner" restrictions on
speech as long as they are "reasonable". For example requiring people to
obtain a permit, to hold a meeting in a public building, or to conduct a
demonstation that may interfere with traffic, constitutes a justifiable
regulation.

As long as you do not block the roads, I think it will be fine

3_ fitting in, without ackowledging style, just the ambiance

4_ trying to picture the people i meet in an every day setting

5_ trying to picture the people i meet naked at an e party

thanks for the info. heres my reaction>>

"reasonable" i guess is the loophole in which the cops assume their power.
there is social accepted "reason" now to shut down events, and their
opinions on reason include:
-young people gathered together without supervision is dangerous
-young people gathered together without supervision late at night is dangerous
-young people gathered together to have fun while they are on duty.
-damn kidz!
-young people with bigger pants than them (they might feel intimidated that
they cant tell who has the bigger dick)
-young people gathered late at night have been observed by other
outstanding citizens to have way too much energy and MUST be on drugs.
-young people gathering together from big warehouses to church basements
...heaven forbid that they party in places used as bingo facilities during
the day.
-"look marge, i understand theyre just having fun, but you saw 20/20. you
know how many people here are on drugs.."

and so on and so on.. their "obective" perspective on our scene is
formulated from secondary and even more indirect sources of info, which can
be manipulatively used as evidence to support their first impression of us
silly looking people stayin up longer than them and appearing to be having
fun.

thus, the ohio cops probably found "reasonable" evidence leading to call
oil city police last friday and warn officials there (a very small town)
that 1000 kids were going to riot and do drugs all night. the oil city cops
naturally got scared and did not let us in due to a minor error in us not
recieving fire permits...but i think fire permits are only needed for more
amounts of people...there were certainly not 1000 people coming to oil
city.

we didnt interupt traffic on the main street until we were denied entry and
had no choice to go out on the street, on which we were threatened to be
charged with loitering.
akron cops sure did a good job at spreading the good vibe of keeping their
guests welome!! im never going to oil city again!!!

it seems like to party we must do more than not block the roads..
-we need to show why its reasonable to dance at unorthodox hours.
-we need to show why we dance, and why we need to!
-we need to show reason that we are unviolent people, but we do have our
demands, such as the right to listen to loud music all night so long as it
doesnt impose on the rights of others.
-we need to show reason that drugs are inevitable, and addiction is not.

cops everywhere are unifying against our cause. we have to unify against
theirs by their voice of reason...

this shits getting national now. lets have a love parade in DC!!
id go..id pass on mad flyers for it. :)

...........the saga continues..........

Greetings and salutations kiddies, I was just sitting here taking in all
the posts about the Akron thing, and the 20/20 thing. And it seems that I'm
getting a little distressed. I was one of the first to post a note asking
people to email 20/20 for their rude, one sided story,and many replied. And
as some of you answered, I noticed one major problem. Some of "us" are not
admitting that 20/20 showed a big problem that really does exist! I dj 2 to
3 times a week all over this great(?) country of ours and I hardly see a
show where 50% to 75% of the crowd isn't out of their heads. THIS SUCKS!!
Most people are missing the whole point!! I see alot of younger kids at the
shows. Many under 16! This is unnessary!! Most of these younger kids are
the one's with no focus. They come to the shows because it's the "in"
thing. (my appologies to all the young ravers that actually care about the
music and the dj's,and don't go to event's just to
smoke,snort,shoot,eat,drink whatever all night till you face first on the
ground!)
       We as a "scene" get really defensive when people say, "oh your a
raver, so you do drugs?!" We say "no" , "we love the music, the dancing,
the atmosphere." Then later that night we ( we = the scene in general, not
everyone, but most)
suck down 1 or 2 e's ect. HIPOCRATES!! If we all loved the music, and the
atmosphere and we could do it mostly drug free, we wouldn't have the
problems we have been encountering. If police could investigate a party and
find only one or two  small tokens of something "bad" on the ground,
chances are it wouldn't make the cover of the newspaper on monday!We need
to RE-FOCUS as a scene!!
     Also,lets look at the cops side of the coin. How much do these cops
know about us? Probably only what they have heard from the Tv, or the
press. Well I know for fact that most of this has been very negitive press.
So now a cop pumped with negitive knowledge of our scene, something he
didn't really understand in the first place, is called to a "rave" to."take
a closer look". As he walks in, is he going to see "our" version of a
"rave" (ie. the music, the friends, the atmosphere, etc...) NO!!! He is
going to see the 20/20 version of a "EVIL RAVE"! And what he see's really
does suck! Young kids wacked out thier heads, older kids snorting stuff
that I won't even clean my floors with! So to him an "outsider" it's even
worse than the 20/20 thing and it's right in front of him,think about it if
you were him how would this look to you!?? But to US, the "ravers", it's
just another show. Our sense of normal situations has been shifted over the
years.More and more is being seen as "ok". I remember in 1991, when I was a
little schmuck who used to get rocked, the older people in the scene back
then  kind of told me that I was a being stupid and it wouldn't be
tolerated!That laying on the floor was not the reason to be there, and in
some cases actually led me to the door!! I think we need to do something
like that,I think we need to overhaul the "rules" of a show, so that we can
be proud of what we do for a living / for a life/for fun.

Ok , so the moral of my rambling is: Before you start planning the
overthrow of the APD (or any PD for that matter), look at what they
probably knew about the whole thing, put your self in thier shoes and mull
it over for a while.You can't expect them to respect us and understand us
till we show respect and understanding to them. MY THOUGHTS:::Clean up the
scene alittle bit, make sure each planned event is REALLY ORGANIZED, GET
THE PERMITS (get permits that you don't even need just in case) and then
talk to the cops , ask them to work security. Nothing better than having a
policeman that is getting paid $20 an hour tell the other cops that show up
that, "everything is fine here!!" Use your brains, keep it real,
and.............
I'LL SEE ALL YA TRUE MUSIC LOVIN KIDS AT 4:20 !!!!!

PEACE & RESPECTS, (SORRY I WAS RAMBLIN)

sorry if some of you got this already but i want to get flyers to anyone
who wants them... 

just reply to me and answer the following questions, and i'll get you a 
stack of our flyers by the end of this week: 

1) how many do you want -

2) what will they be used for (ie will you help me distribute them in your
area, at record shops, cafes, clubs or wherever rave-friendly people are
found...or do you just want them for your personal collection?  either way
is okay, just be specific if you can) -

3) where should i send them -

also, there's a few of you out there who i send flyers to regularly, you
know who you are.  but if you want to double-check to make sure you'll get
some, just reply to this message anyway and remind me. 

finally, to those of you i have missed in the past, i apologize...i
usually honor about 90% of the requests but sometimes i run out of flyers,
money, or time...but i will try to hit all of you this time.

Hey Coount Zero

	I saw this on a vinyl distribution list I subscribe to.  Is this you:

COUNT ZERO- Brutal Decade (Critical Mass)
Big funked-up funky beatiness on the Critical Mass ('Mr Natural')
label. A-side is a fast-paced piece of beat mayhem with tuff breaks
and cool samples. Flip has more of a Cloak & Dagger vibe to it.

and young people are still people, citizens of these United States of
America and guaranteed the same Constitutional rights by law. Including
the right to assemble. Look as long as we are afraid to stand up for our
rights they will continue to chip away at them. No other religious,
ethnic, or minority group would stand for the way we are treated but for
some odd reason we often feel as though we somehow deserve it

And the hippies weren't? They still protested, did about 10 times the
amount of drugs and infact shook a few things up in their day. Hell, they
were protesting what the government was doing to people overseas. We are
protesting what the goverment is doing to US as American citizens.

 Pete you say all of this stuff about standing up for our rights,  and
then you say that your never going back to Oil City.  This doesn't make
sense to me. You would support Akron but not a small  town trying to
make a scene this is not the first party in O.C. a couple went off
really well. Think about what you are saying.

You know in watching all this hostility and overeaction to our little
scene just as it is about to double our quadruple, makes me think of what
happened in the UK before the Criminal Justice Act became law. I remember
that someone I talked to in the UK said that us yanks should consider
ourselves lucky in that we have a Constitution that would forbid anythink
as draconian as the CJA from passing. Today I am not so sure. Anyway my
point is that in the UK the larger promoters banded together to fight it
under the name of United Sound Systems. So I ask this question, where are
the promoters in this? To me they have more to lose than the average
raver, why aren't they out front leading the way? In the UK while the CJA
still passed and United Systems was defeated they did succeed in winning
public opinion and if the UK had been a representative democracy in which
public opinion has an effect on public policy then they would have won.
You can only expect that as the scene grows over the next year these
attacks will become even more malicious and frequent. At some point, Pat
Robinson or Newt Gingrich may even propose a national law outlawing raves.
The point is to be ready now BEFORE that happens. Come on, I know we're
all slackers but you see what's comming so prepare now before it happens
so that we can at least have a fighting chance. The same person I talked
to about the UK's CJA told me she didn't think American ravers were as
organized or as interested to mount the kind of opposition to  an 
Anti-Rave Bill or action here in the US and I would very much like to
probe this person wrong. If all we are are a bunch of kids who want to
zone out and not deal with reality then perhaps we will get what we
deserve. Being a raver doesn't mean "roll over and play dead". If house
music is a religion then we have a right to practice it un touched by
government.

Some things that can be done:

DOCUMENT IT

-Have someone take a video camera or a photo camera to each party to
specifically film the actions of the police.

-Take names, badge #'s etc. They are required by law to give you this
information. We have no "Secret Police" here.

-Start building a case. Sit down with your evidence and ask yourself if
the actions taken were unreasonable.

MEDIA


-Find the few allies we have in the media and let them know how we get
harshed. Not all media is against us. Perhaps you might even want to
consider filming a story for MTV News Unfiltered. They love this kinda
"kids vs. the establishment" kinda thing. Who knows, maybe they will film
future protests.

-Use every tool at your disposal to distribute information on what went on
and what, when, where, and how the protest is going to take place. Use the
Internet (duh!), contact your friends on college or pirate radio stations.
Contact the magazines like URB, MixMag USA and Massive and let them know
what went down. 


LEGALITY

-Find friends who have a backround in law and have them look at the
regulations for whatever locality governing demonstrations, dancing,
amplified music, zoning, occupancy, etc.

-When you have clear evidence that your rights have been violated and you
were doing nothing illeagal go to the ACLU, they are probably our biggest
legal ally. They have been known to fight alot of "david vs. goliath"
cases and win. The key thing to remember is that they are a Civil Rights
organization so you have to prove your civil rights were violated before
they take your case.

ORGANIZATION

-Call your local promoters in the area where the harshness went down and
tell them flat out that you plan to protest it and it would be a great
idea if they came since their party was the primary target of the police
action.

-Have a few people who are smart and articulate arrange for a meeting with
the local gestapo to discuss the dispute. Don't be afraid of the police,
remember they work for us. We all pay taxes.

-Don't be afraid to spend a night in jail. Had a few people not done that
back in the 60's I'd probably still be drinking out of a water fountain
marked "colored". Remember they can only hold you for 48 hours unless they
charge you with something. 

-This ties in with the point above. If you are going to stand up for your
rights then by all means do it cleanly. Don't get caught with drugs on you
period. This only reinforces their belief system.



Thing to remember is all this has gone down before in the UK. The scene
there is still thriving even after the government "banned" raves. The
reason that is is because the people there were organized and smart enough
to fight the power using every tool at their disposal. If the Brits can do
it then we can too.

high, i'm Keane.

		i'm working with some local cats, LOTSA local cats to bring together a
SIT DOWN protest in front of the AKRON POLICE DEPT. afterwards there
will be a lil party (look out for "peaceful assembly" preflyers). I
don't know if you've seen my posts, but this event isn't about one akron
party(s) getting shut down in one city. to us this represents OUR ENTIRE
SCENE. we want to start doing these things all over the countrry this
summer before select parties. nothing rowdy or drug induced, just a
VOICE to let them know we aren't what they think we are (ie drug crazed
kids). we need to show them we are THE YOUTH gathered from all different
walks of life for PLUR. your message is down, i think you should
consider participating in this event, getting involved, and taking what
you learn back to your scene so others will do the same. i will try to
retrieve some lost messages (my campus email is oh so fuckt) to send to
ya and repost on pb-cle raves. lemme know what ya think.

		Keane.

TRUEDAT
	we need unity, (the U in PLUR is not exclusive. it is everybody an
every scene)

	true, dere are "wacker" scenes. but if ya don't like what ya see,
educate. don't diss. teach by example. we all have ups an downs

we definately can't be competing amongst ourselves.

	PLUR, keane

let me reiterate:
PEACE LOVE UNITY RESPECT

Doable.  I'll get the camcorder out of mothballs and see what I can do.

Man, flyers and felt tip pens are good for this.  So are microcassette

If anyone has any friends at local TV stations, this might come in 
handy.  Don't know what kind of effect it would have, but you never know.

On top of it.  Might start another site up on my page, and link it to my 
deck in school.

Radio stations:  Definitly not a problem.  I'll ask Adam and see what's 
going down this weekend.  Maybe a call in show?

Not to mention zines galore.  And the classic poster campaigns, or is 
that pushing things a bit?

Hmmm...  right to gather peacefully..  check.  Not being a legal eagle, I 
can't specifically name any others.  Anyone...  anyone...

Just be sure to leave things the cops like to construe as 'weapons' at 
home.  Ex.:  My omnipresent tool kit, hardback books (ever get whacked 
with one?), and handkercheifs (famously misconstrued as gang colours..  
don't ask).

All things being considered, I'm not afraid to spend an evenig in jail 
(shucks, it's a hell of a lot more comfortable than my dorm).

Your point is well taken hoever I think you missed a few things.

1. No one is proposing to overthrow the police. What is pposed is a
demonstration against unfair treatment. That is our right as citizens of a
democracy. This is not a police state (yet). If we keep letting police
shut things down  in an unreasonable manner perhaps we will end up like
France (where a rapper right now is in jail for simply criticizingthe
police in a song).

2. The Drug Problem - While I agree there is a problem with kids using
drugs that problem extends beyond the rave scene. One of the things that
seems to make the problem greater is the media constatly telling people
that raves are no more than drug parties. Well if I were a kid looking to
score some drugs in a place with loud music and brilliant visuals I'd say,
"I'm going to one of those!". If you noticed the drug problem has only
gotten worse in line with the amount of media coverage. It is not our
responsibility to rid the country of drugs. Especially when the CIA might
have brought some in in the first place. All we can do is try to get a
handle on the problem and if we are making an honest attempt to curtail
drug use at parties then that is all that is expected.

3. The worse thing about these discussions is that nothing is ever done
because someone divides us. In your case you are doing it by age. Look if
a 16 year old can get a driver's license then they should be able to
attend an all night party unless of course there is a curfew or some other
legal reason they can't. I've seen just as many 21 year olds zonked out
their minds as 16 year olds so this is not an issue. The quickest way to
diffuse any sort of movement is to get them fighting amongst themselves.
You should know this Steve. Unity will be the key to our success. 

4. Were drugs legalized they still would want to shut raves down? Why?
Because the same people that saw the hippies as a threat see us as a
threat. Anytime you get large people of different races, religions, sexual
orientation, etc together and anytime those people don't see their
differences as something to fear then "the powers that be" will try to
find some way to stop it. We can never be human's in this society. We have
to be pigeonholed so that we "know our place". It's time this thinking
ended and it is very likely the "unity among all groups" type of thinking
will be key to our survival in the next century. "Why can't we all just
get along?" becasue "they won't let us. Pure and simple.

5. The main issue here is our we being treated unfairly. If we are then it
is our responsibility to stand up for our rights Steve.

YES! thats what i've been sayin to all the wacked out cats in wackRON
for years.  one of the main reasons i left the G. Dead scene in the
early 90's was b/c of the same detteration thats killin our scene,
then i went to a party in 91 or 92 in NYC that was exactly what that
scene was suppose to be like. i remember an incedent at the attick
when i told some folks that they have to get rid of the nitrous it was
doin the same thing to the rave scene i saw happen to the dead scene,
and the next day someone phished down the steps and got fooked up, and
that was the main reson why things went down hill. so what do we say
to the money grubbin chumps that are fuckin things up for all of us,
do we kick'em out, or try to teach them????  should we start over. or
do we remodel what we have goin on now. i would love to hear so ideas
of ppl on what we can do.

yo chill. im not going back to oil city cuz its a shit town with one main
road and a bunch of hicks and drunks at night. this has nothing to do with
unity of the rave scene. its my opinion of the city. i know theres a lot of
oil city ravers i would like to see there, but the unity i was talking
about had nothing to do with where the fuck i choose to go. ive passed out
flyers for oil city parties before and will continue to do so when if i see
them...i can support the oil city scene without having to go back there :P
i never said anything bad about the scene, the dj's, the promoters...i
think i just mentioned my opinions on the police, the townspeople, and how
they treat their guests. Im not interested in showing the oil city cops or
citizens whats right, and im sure theyre not either. were on the same team
here:)
        oil city cops wont listen me..but they will answer to pennsylvania
authorities cuz thats where they get their money from. they might listen to
oil city taxpayers, which i am not one.

i agree with the points joe made- and my little 2 cents is..
(as a freelancer and radio dj, i'm not just pulling this out of the air)

utilize the media all the way! for example,  call college radio- most
people there would be more than happy to spread the word about protests or
injustices done. 

also, try and get it in newspapers! i work for a weekly paper (city paper
in pittsburgh) and would be more than happy to pitch these kinds of things
to my editors.. they're always asking me to write about my views on the
rave scene, since i'm involved in it.. (not like those stiffs on 20/20,
and so on), yet i meet with opposition within the scene, to keep it
"underground". i respect that idea, but i'm also of the mind that it is
not a bad thing to bring this somewhat to the surface, to educate people.
how else are you gonna make a difference? all the general public knows
is what they see on hard copy or tabloid news.if it is that far
underground, it makes it easier for the five-oh and other ignorant folks
to squish us under their boots- we make no noise.

respect, 
grrl13.

Well, I was quite happy with the 20/20 piece. Being from New York and being
hit by the techno bug before the scene was around, I quickly got involved
when Bones started throwing his parties, before drugs meant everything. As
time moved on everything has gotten worst. The love for the music kept me
going. But over the years I would look around and just see dazed out people
laying all over the floor. Thoughts would run through my head constantly like
"Why am I here?" I don't use drugs, so I did stick out like a sore thumb. I
don't fit in with ravers, and judging by experience the real "ravers", the
people who are strictly for the music, do not either. I am not saying I am
better than ravers, because I am not cracked out, but what I am saying is...
Let the drug addicts have their rave scene for the 1.5 years they last, I
will always have my Jeff Mills and Regis records until the day I die. 
Later in the week I will be posting Dan DC's interview in Massive Magazine on
all the rave posts. It tells it like it is, even better than 20/20, so keep
your eyes posted.
Cheers,
Jeff

Ya' know what?  Jeff and Sleepy C have brought up some very good 
points and they need to be seriously considered.  The underground 
community does have a big drug problem.  Maybe we should consider why 
drugs were made illegal in the first place.  I think the idea was to 
keep up from destroying ourselves, not to keep us from having any fun.  
As it has been said many times on this same mailing list, these 
substances are supposed to help us reach another state of 
consciousness with less difficulty.  Have you ever stopped to consider 
that perhaps we were never ment to reach these states that easily?  If 
they are so easily achieved how can they be fully appreciated?  If you 
want to achieve this state exercise your full mental capacity and go 
there visa vi meditation and self-control not the easy $20 hit way.

Personally I would love to go just once to a completely substance free 
party.  If nothing else it would be interesting to see how people 
would interact without being chemically uninhibited.

It's interesting to note that at least one person lists the ABSENCE of 
a particular drug as a positive.  Quite interesting.

You've got it wrong man. Sure some people do drugs till they drop, and I
don't agree with that. But if you can use drug sensibly to increase your
pleasure why not? As long as your not over doin it I don't think it's
that bad.

I don't mean any offense by this but 20/20 is getting what they want out
of you.
There turning you against drugs. Thats what that show was all about. If
your just
doin a little of this and a little of that once or twice a week at a
party and your not
shooting herion and smoking crack then I don't think its going to kill
you or destroy the scene. If you've ever been rollin your nuts off with
the music pounding and the lights flashing in your face you know what

I don't think the majority feels as if alcohol promotes good vibes at
parties. In fact, the drug is sluggish and disgusting. Most ravers will
tell you this.

To Everyone Who Cares:

   With all the media attention, legal issues, and violations of citizens
rights, we, as a culture, have decided to do something about it. We our
forming a national organization to protect and defend the rights of people
who chose to live their life underground. I have contacted the ACLU and
the Citzen's Commision on Human Rights and they have advised us to form an
organization of our own. They strongly agree that a whole organization of
people with the same interests is the best route to take.

So join in and let your voice be heard.

The organization is going to be named PLUR (Protecting and Living The
Underground Culture), for now. If anyone has ideas on a different name
mail it. We need it soon, within the next few days because we our going to
print flyers, t-shirts, member cards, bumper stickers, letterhead and the
whole deal. 

What you Get: The fee for joining is going to be $10.00 (the cost of a
small rave) and will include a mass amount of stuff. We will scope out an
area for you if you are planning to have a rave (i.e. legal issues such as
permits, curfews, building capacities, and everything involved). We will
have a legal staff to advise you on your rights for any reason (being
arrested, fined, harrassed, and barred entry from events). We have found
to volunteer lawyers to defend the rights of legal cases in which we think
a persons rights have been violated (This includes promoters, Djs, ravers,
average people). We will get and give you all legal information for
protests etc., as we plan to have a physical involvement in those. You
will also get a monthly newsletter, i.d. card, bumper sticker
(re-useable), an invitation to a members only national rave (coming this
summer, which hopefully will be free), along with all of the services
listed above for free. This isnot everything, as we are just forming and more stuff will be included in
the offical application. You must e-mail portod@ccbc.ml.org to recieve an
application. Include your name, address, phone number, and e-mail.
Depending on the costs we wish to include a t-shirt with our logo, your
member name, and your city and state.
We will be a legal organization. I have the papers on their journey in the
mail. We are legal and the Offical club of the underground culture.


This is going to be the best thing that has happened for our culture since
it was born. Please join, we need a couple of thousand people to really
stand up and make a difference. We are the first and only organization
that is not afraid to defend who we are. We have put alot of effort this
past year into this and it is finally here. Make a difference, join our
organization.

E-Mail portod@ccbc.ml.org for an application or more info.

   As this organization is being formed in the Pittsburgh area we need
local volunteers to help out. People interested in volunteering in the
office answering phones, processing applications and e-mail, research and
processing mail (incoming and out). Whatever way you can help, let us
know. We want your opinions and ideas, also.

Luke, 
Listen, for the past SIX years I have been watching, analyzing, and studying
ravers, especially on the east coast (New York, DC). For the past two years
there has been no such meaning as "not over doing it." I am not saying all
people are getting totally cracked, but most are, and in a situation like
parties where media like 20/20 steps in, the majority carries the image. If
you do experiment with drugs, that's cool, but even doing a little once you
get past experimenting, is only going damage your body. What happens is, when
you are on drugs, you don't realize what you are doing to yourself. Trust me
on this one. "There is no such thing as a little not doing any harm."
I would like to hear your comments back on this, cool?
Take care!

you sed:

shouldnt that be PLUC>?

i think you need a more solid name..?? just a suggestion..


i like CULT>>> [or CULTURE for added meaning]
Citizens of Underground Love Tribes, a [United Raver Entity]

i really like the word cult because people expect a rebellion, and thats
what were here to do!

its on the positive tip..

howdy doodty all;)

here's an idea i have for a new type of social gathering<->

this will be a totaly interactive party meaning that everyone is 
involved or can be, we're not gonna make yem participate.  at the door 
when ya come in you'll be asked visual or audioal. what i have in mind 
is a light board that will be made simple enough for the average joe 
or sally to run with 4 different slots for 4 different ppl who will be 
runing certain lights with the main light guy, and the sounds will be 
step up simular with 4 slots open for ppl to grove with the dj with 
such devises as a drum with mic and effects, a drum machine, and a 
couple of other things all grovin together. the way its gonna be 
organized is the card you recieve when you enter will entitle you to 
15 mins at the controlls of influence of your choose, so if ya don't 
feel like groovin or your doughtful of your skills you can give your 
card to someone ya like to hear or see groove more.  the first couple 
wil be small 100ppl or so, and the first one will be TOTALLY DRUG 
FREE. untill we can get the basics together. i don't know would any of 
ya kids go to a party like this????/ reply

who are you to say drugs are a problem? substances have been used for alot
of things all throughout history from pain elimination to personal
spirituality quests... now we have this inefficient, ineffectual, paternal,
hierarchical entity known as the police, which was started by a
hippocritical government who screams freedom but wants to eliminate
recreational drugs, natural extracts that free ppl wish to ingest to
alleviate ailments, and basic freedoms that grown adults want to exercise
(speech specifically) all freedoms that were put forth by the beloved free
democratic government. this government is supposed to be the ppl-the police
are the child of the government and thus the ppl, us-i believe the child
needs a spanking.......

drugs, are illegal, the same reason prostitution is, because this
capitalistic economy, and, society, is run by the ppl who own the means of
production, not the everyday majority. which do not have a hold on the
profit generating capabilities of them.

first, you are a sheep and the government is yer shepherd. you have been
affected past return by their propaganda

second, i am assuming you are christian, eluding to the viability of
psychoactives in a religious or spiritual context; if fundamental
christians or near-fundamentals, would step back and view this comment away
from the situation, you'd see how hippacritical (sp?) it is. your god who
is supposed to be all knowing and ever loving (a hippacritical statement in
itself), are you arguing with your god's decision to make these substances
available? or are you suggesting that the creation has surpassed the
creator in knowledge?

(if you didn't mean that how i thought, or you're not christian: i didn't

lemme see some credentials to your expertise on the area of spiritual

without the block of salt

I'd agree - they brought up well-thought out comments on the scene,
people's involvement and drugs.  Thanks guys...perhaps I'll cook up a
thoughtful response.

Chris - I would agree with you that there are 'good' things about drugs,
even besides the 'legitimate' reasons of pain killin' and spiritual blah
blah blah...there's something valuable to the pleasurable/interesting
effects of various chemicals have on our bodies, for both just the raw
experience and social context of it.  
	But there's a difference between that and todays rave scene - lots
of kids use drugs to escape from their problems - either with social
interaction, their families, or poor self image - or just to 'feel cool'
like other kids.  The lack of thought put into the drug use seems to be
the biggest problem.  Oh, I'll just do drug X and I'll feel good
and thus I'll have a good time.  If kids had creative thought and
motivation instead of the idea of instant gratification in their
heads, the scene would be soo much better.  People wouldn't just run away
when the cops come to bust up a party, but instead be able to defend
themselves and stand up for their rights (whether or not they'll be
respected).
	Also if as many kids as do drugs could legitimately defend their
use of them, there would be a much bigger more for legalization (or, at
least wide social legitimization, such as is happening with pot)  No, I
don't read people's thoughts, and don't presume to have a solution, but I
think there is a drug problem in america, which is more concentrated in
the rave scene.

True, but this is a problem bigger than rave scene drug use...I'm not sure
if these things would be legal in a non-capitolist state either, though.
Of course, such a gawdy and extravagent thing as 'rave' probably could
never have come about without capitolism.

> first, you are a sheep and the government is yer shepherd. you have been

Everything is propaghanda.  Nothing is true.  Everything is permitted.
I think your assuming too much here - how can you tell if someone's been
manipulated or come upon their beliefs 'on their own'?

> (if you didn't mean that how i thought, or you're not christian: i didn't
> mean to start a list holy war)

Woah - i don't think many ravers come from the religious right that's for
sure (am I right?) - remember this IS a rave list.  Also, christian means
many things to many people - there are both open and closed-minded
christians just like any other kind of person.  Not meanin' to attack, I
can see where you'r comin' from.  

But anyway...good to hear lurkin' thoughts. :)  I like it when a variety
of people voice-up on this list...makes me feel like there's actually
people out there - imagine that!  :0 :P :)

l8s all,
 Geoff

I agree with you that drugs do have many good uses and, when used in
moderation, responsibility, blah blah blah, are not a problem.  But I also
have to agree that drugs are a problem in our scene.  I've seen people
shooting up in bathrooms here in Cleveland (possibly speed? likely
heroin), and I've also seen people smoking crack.  I can understand using
lsd and ecstacy at a party, even speed, but I really don't think crack or
heroin have *any* place at a party.  It's ridiculous to have to step over
people who are so fucked up they can't do anything but sit on the ground.
I'm not condeming drugs at all, I have no problem with people who use
drugs, but there is clearly abuse/misuse of substances at parties, and it
*is* a problem.  I understand that some people don't think it's a problem
because they don't use drugs or don't care who does what with their
bodies, but regardless of that, how does it look to "outsiders"? How did
it look to 20/20? I'll stop babling now :)

Chris

hi there pb-cle land. with all of this talk of kids and drugs, i thought
(although you might not agree with it) you would want the point of view
of a KID who has some experiance with DRUGS [which, of course - isn't
me... i got it off of the internet somewhere, i think]. anyways, this
kid just turned 16, lets hear what he has to say:

=-=-=
"besides the occasional (2-3 times a month) toke, my only drug use is
acid (moderate doses) at raves (which i go to once-twice a month). I a
not alone. I know about 4-5 other people who use acid in the exact same
way, just because they know what's up. now let me explain why. all those
who have tripped before know the extreme power of psychedelics. in my
opinion when the drug has taken effect, and the drumnbass is BOOMIN
through the speakers, and you are on the dancefloor giving it 115%  it
can't be beat. and I know there are others out there who know the same.
it is not a requirement for me (i often dont trip at raves), I just find
that it enhances the entire raving experiance (the music, mainly) for me.
I have had incredible experiances in these situations (becoming one with
the music, etc) which can not really be described. 

now let me tell you a little bit about myself.
1) I am very healthy.
2) I excel in school (... and i aint lyin').
3) I am extremely happy with my life.

now... i don't know what point i am exactly trying to prove here, but I
just want y'all to know what's up, and that drug use is not always drug
abuse."
=-=-=

.....those crazy kids

i'm rethinking a previous reply to the Union of everyone post-

i don't know whether that post was serious or a goof or what but its oddly
fitting with the whole flow of outside events and discussion on ne-raves
and nw-raves for the past two months or more--

and this time i'm sending it out to the full lists in the cc:
even tho i know many disdain massive cross posts we are entering a new
phase perhaps which is why i'm bothering with this, maybe bothering some
folx.

the new phase means we're not in a cycle of media blip -> undergound again
and cycle repeats, the new phase means that other forces are coming
together economic and political that *could* (notice the possible future
state) signifcantly change our opportunities to come together, laws could
be passed which restrict our freedom significantly -  

i do think we need to discuss this on a broad scale as local and global
cyber communities.  there has been discussion on and off for a few months
on two lists about concerted responses to the media abuse of our culture,
about organizing non-profits, about the names of our events and related
threads and now about more specific political action....

so i'm suggesting we reflect on what brings us together and how do we want
to support one another. 
i think various non-profits with multiple purposes linking the muzik to
other artisic, cultural, and social change agendas would be good and maybe
its time to do several things at once - come together and disperse like a
blob of mercury scatters when you hit it with a fist.....

in other words, lets maintain and give up our identity simultaneously,
when the whole rave vs. rage discussion was in full swing on ne-raves i
just sat it out - now the broadcat media and music industry will take
over the name rave so lets just mutate it a bit maybe we should call them
something new multiple names for multiple purposes, parties, gatherings
etc.  i would love to see surprising things happen - lets have free techno
events to raise money for the local fire department and do it in the
middle of the day, lets dance to techno on lunch breaks downtown in
business clothes (an offshoot of a Vancouver protest suggestion by
someone), lets join in with Matt Fox, a postmodern christian theologian
and use techno to celebrate mass and teach professionals at conferneces
how to re-awaken their ability to shake their body-soul, lets show people
that techno is about celebrating like its our last moments on this earth
and its a joy to gather together...

one very powerful happening i experienced with techno was this weekend at
a workshop Matt Fox led at a spirit-nature environmentalist conference
in WA state and he started the workshop with traditional native american
circle dances and then it was on to questions and answers about how to
reach out & win over people to be repsonsible for the earth. then for the
last 15 minutes he played a techno tape (basicly light trance low BPMs)
and about forty people- ages 20s to 70s became instant ravers - seriously,
beautifully, many seemed awkward and quite a few were awe inspiring
especially two women around 70 yrs. old maybe- they were smiling and going
off with a vibe as intense as any i've ever seen!  :)

** tekknow muzik is about wonder and surprise.....
enjoy-

The affect of drugs on the mind may be akin to loosening of the way one views
reality or taken to the extreme a shattering of one's world view.  It is very
easy for one to become mired in one's personal experiences in life, unable to 
even conceive of things outside one's experience.  Drugs let one see
alternatives that would either not be apparent.  Some recent work along these
lines include the UCLA study of the affects of MDMA on humans and the Russian
use of Ketamine in various personal therapies of an introspective nature.

Coming out of the drug induced state may be both a chemical and psychological
experience, in your mind rebuilding old pathways and finding new ones to
accept the experiences newly imprinted.

Just some odd thoughts,

Philip

if you look for contradictions, youre gonna find them..so what?
if you look for love, your gonna find it...which do you choose?

ive been thinking of how right everyone is..about everything...even when
people seem to conflict in opinion; they like to oppose one another cuz its
the right thing to do...weve been brought up to challenge a belief system,
as logical as it seems...weve been brought up to embrace a belief system,
as logical as that is.....weve learned to share data objectively and form
our own hypothesis....as logical as that seems.

well i think Plato fucked it all up for us with this realism crap....i dont
buy it..maybe we were fools to believe him.theres no way we can convey a
total belief system with just words...words are limited and
subjective....they are tones triggered in your head when you read them or
hear someone saying them...they are JUST words...and tones.....

someone told me..
"THE ZONE WHERE THE DRONE LIVES IS THE HOME OF THE TONE KIDS"

in a rhyme you have all the answers to the universe. if everyone talked
alike and had the same rhythm and meant the same thing with each word,
maybe we could understand each other, as clones..but we are not...we are
*special* we are ALL exceptions to the rule...ALL of us...we can
communicate consciousness a lot easier than spirituality, with words that
is..thats where music and dancing comes in i guess.

there is no rule..everyone seems to have a concept of "mass society" what
does this mean? does this imply that inviduals within a mass society are
unified? does this mean theyre completely alike and act the same way for
the same reason? NO! but its easy to assume...weve all seen the storm
troopers and nazis in movies..its easy to visualize us as part of a
whole... as bits of a byte of a computer.

i just have to say that for me its easier to see the whole as part of me,
not part of a whole. sounds a little selfish, sounds a little hedonistic
and egofilled sure, but thats what us humans are all about..huh? all we
know is us. i dont owe anyone my life, its really not mine..its jsut
flowing through me right now.  im not living my life worrying about why we
do what we do....im just gonna do it. anyone have a problem with that?
good.

one note about unity and such is that if there is any culture that is in
any way homogenous...we are the LAST! were not really even self
contained..well never be purely unified in a utopian sense. its nice to
believe isnt it? we could be the first..theres nothing but all of history
stopping us...i think we are more of just the lastest phase in
evolution...there will be more to come... our kids we be just as crazy and
misunderstood as us.

remeber we also learned when we kept asking mommy why? why? why? why? she
told us..."cuz thats the way it is...now get some sleep."

  curiousity killed the cat i guess. the cat's name was fate.

.......we are in the realm of picses...so all you rational cognitive headz
beware that there some things your words or logic cant explain. picses is a
beautiful sign..   its the sign of destiny and the reincarnation...and all
of our causal (not casual) relationships seem distant and unimportant,
because no matter what you think, we believe what we believe. its not about
knowing the truth, its all about seeking it, and living it, and finding the
part we like for ourselves...and sharing that with others through one of a
kind experiences...

im talking about this just because id like to let open people, who are
aware that theres is more than logic and more that what we know, that i see
more to each one of us as ravers...theyre are more to christians than
christians..names have caused us a big communication problem..dammit Plato.
argggh

*looks everyone in the eyes* <--this is what email lacks

so,  many people unknowing of our rituals are trying to say that were doing
doing something wrong...its theyre call..theyre right. when its your call
youll be right. as long as your right in a beautiful way, cuz thats what
makes you believable...

im not surprised that people choose these times to talk about unity and
religion, because we all want to make harmony with others of this whole
belief thing...its pisces..its mysterious...my realistic advice is to focus
on your own harmony, not how you harmonize with others.. we are on the path
to become truly independent creatures..at least it appears that way...we
migth be just as dependent on things made by man or on other living
induviduals; this may be our destiny, but all of our progress will
accelerate once we know how to be harmonic alone first.

id like to kick shout outs to everyone involved with caring for everyone in
the scene...but i also see that soon this shits gonna blow up BIG and we
wont have the vibe anymore...and we wont have the need to weed out the
scene...well weed ourselves out...you never thought you would...but you
were young.....you gonna leave it..most of us who have it figured out will
leave because everyone else will be a burden to our backs.. unless they
themselves truly wanna learn from us, in which case we will teach them what
we know...

or whatever you know....my point is its not the end of the world when the
law comes crashing down..well all stand up for our rights and were gonna
have fun doing it..then we can be the snobs that we are and say that we
were ravers before anyone else...heehee "you mean you actually partied in a
warehouse?"

please no one spam me for not talking about anything concrete..im in a very
abstract mood :P what else is new?

well i guess the moral is>look for your own pisces and how does it affect
your views on organized spiritualty??..if youve found spirtituality through
raving, great! you know what it feels like...now try to do it without
dancing or doing e ... just close your eyes and believe all those magical
things youved believed will come true...and you know what? we really CAN do
anything we want to...just need to follow the path weve already chosen for
ourselves...its that easy!

wow i never knew i had the time for a post like this..i have a physics test
tommorow..but its ALL good..believe dat. i do. :)

O.K., I guess I might as well jump in here.  If we're going to do a PB-CLE
tape, then lets do it right.  That means everyon from Western PA into
Ohio, right?! I'll volunteer to help produce the final mix, and will do
so on the 8-track digital tape deck at WPTS, so if you have a DAT tape,
send that instead of a cassette.  Cassettes are o.k., but if you have the
resources to work in the digital domain, definitely keep it there and send
a CD or DAT, we have all of these media at the station.  I'd like to keep
the production to a near mix-tape quality, that is to say I'd like to
organize the songs in such a way that we can put the mix together so that
there is little blank space between tracks. 

Anyways, send your stuff to Skoop and when he has it all together, we can 
do the mastering on DAT, and have a nice *quality* mix for those who are 
interested.  I'm assuming we won't get more than a half hour of material, 
but who knows, we may be pleasently surprised.  Also, I have all of the 
major dektop publishing tools, so if someone is a good artist and wants 
to get together on the J-Card for this, again ... let me know.

O.K., I guess I might as well jump in here.  If we're going to do a =

tape, then lets do it right.  That means everyon from Western PA into

send that instead of a cassette.  Cassettes are o.k., but if you have =

a CD or DAT, we have all of these media at the station.  I'd like to =

the production to a near mix-tape quality, that is to say I'd like to

that
there is little blank space between tracks.=20
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

I don't have a problem with this...I've seen the WPTS production room, =
and it's sweet.
If Tea can tweak the final master to match levels, eq, etc., so much the =
better.

The only issue doing this on DAT at WPTS raises is:  how are we going to =

to sit there and run off tape after tape after tape at WPTS.  (I was =
planning on doing it this way also, but at least I'll be able to do it =
from home, and therefore I'll be able to do other things while the tapes =

okay enough philosophy..hehe

i have access a 1 GIG JAZ disk for Macintosh Hard Disk Recording using top
of the line DMR software (if forget the name..i havent used it yet)..

i cant keep this disk, but what i can do is burn a CD from it after i copy
the tracks from tape or DAT..possibly ADAT, (have a tape as well if you
have ADAT)..and since its much easier to make dubs from a CD than a dat,
and less time consuming if it means hanging out in the studio vs. hanging
out at home

sooo i propose maybe that we give all our stuff to jimg/skoop and then ill
come home one weekend and meet you guys for a listening session? we can
determine the order of the songs? it would be nice if they could be mixed
continuosly, i guess thatll be up to tea... but if say we get 30 mins of
music..we can have one sided mixed and one side just cuts that would be
even better...its hard to tell whether all of our styles will be mixable.
whatever we decide, ill go back up to the studio i have access to this
semster and put it on a hard disk. from there i can make as many CD's as i
want, provided i have $$ for materials.

i can find out the prices individually ...i would estimate $10-$15 per
person if we make 5-10 CD's...then the musicmakers would all have the
luxury of having one of our tracks on CD and we can organize our own scheme
of tape distrution, since almost everyone has the ability to tape from a CD
nowadayz..huh?

im down either way, its jsut a suggestion if duplication seems to arduous.

but hmmm it brings up other questions..
im not sure yet if ill have problems with the professional aspect that we
are selling other peoples musik as well as are own; depends on how its
promoted.
i can talk to my friend mark (alien love tribe) and he could sell the tape
in their new catalogue possibly (i dont know who gets that though), we
could advertise on the other rave lists...just a more outgoing marketing
plan for our music [we deserve compensatiom for representin i
think]...would anyone have a problem with this? who would be in charge of
distribution and money? i dont want to be in charge, but i wanna make sure
that the main motive is to get this shit out to people..its almost like a
collective demo... im very ambitious with my music i dont care who hears
it..(ive gotten compliments from friends parents who loved listening to it
in the car)..i mean im proud of what i make...is everyone else? im very
curious to what everyone sounds like...

i agree with tea that if were gonna spend the time to do it we should do it
professional..if we are serious about our music, i really dont think its a
bad idea to be businesslike about it; if this isnt about representin the
412 properly, and you guyz dont feel strongly about your own tracks, then i
might not want to do this....


what does everyone else think?

love peter

>what does everyone else think?

i will take any publicity i can get.  i am also proud
of my music, and do not expect to make any money
on this project, so you can take what i give you, and
do whatever needs to be done with it as long as my
name stays with it.  you can sell it, give it away, 
sample it, dub it, whatever...  i can't speak for whoever
else is contributing, but that's how i feel.

as for making this continually mixed, i don't think that
is such a good idea.  it is rather difficult to mix up
different styles smoothly (i'm assuming everybody is doing
something different...i'll probably be submitting a 100bpm dub
track and a 180bpm gabber one), and it is also hard to get a
good idea of an artist's music when it is mixed.
i would think that we should have more than 30 minutes
of music, consdering that skoop asked for 2 tracks each.

to master it on cd like pete said would probably be the 
best idea since it can then be dubbed to a tape for distribution
from any number of places.  i don't have any of my music
mastered digitally, but the sound quality is pretty good overall.
if pete is willing to do this, i think it would be good.

one other question:  this is a pb-cle list.  is this tape going
to be open to both pa and ohio artists? or just pa?
i'm sure there are ohio musicians who would like in on this too.

love,
ryu

raves are like ink-blot tests. what you say is there doesn't say so
much about the rave (or ink blot) as it does about your mind.

	i do not like this "i've been there listen to me  i'm your granpa, mom,
police officer, teacher" attitude. 

	i believe the majority of people aren't wacked out. 
		innebriated, yes. but so's the bar down the street.

		jus cuz i don't do some shit doesn't give me ANY right to  assume a
holier than thou attitude. 

	this is not directed to the person who wrote this, i jus see this
attitude come up again and again. if people are that concered they
should educate others. people make good choices based on available
options. people who think won't accept rigid slogans like "jus say no"
or "no such thing as a little doing no harm". give them facts. 
	if ya do this, ya body will do this.
	if ya do this like this, ya body will do this.
	but if ya DON'T know, then don't say.

	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STOP BITCHING ABOUT DRUGS

we need to elevate our scene HIGHER than this.
yea we got peace love unity an respect, but only for those that do the
same chemicals as we do?????????
	
	no. if ya can't find love for the cracked out kid in the corner you may
wanna question your ULTIMATE morals. they are our future. most of them
will change. do ya want them gettin older an sober an sayin "fuck this
fucked up fake ass scene, everyone's fightin over which drugs are
"unacceptable"? 

	us older cats DON'T KNOW IT ALL!! we need to share with the younger
kids. like, be able to sit NEXT to them, not just LOOK DOWN at them.
whenever i start feelin a bit up on my high horse i just think of times
that i made mistakes and i find it hard to TRULY chastise my friends
about meth or whatever. when i was makin my mistakes i didn't realize
them till MUCH LATER. like even YEARS after. so i shouldn't expect kids
to be adults, and kids shouldn't expect "adults" to bitch ALL THE TIME. 
	what i do is this. I, KEANE TONEY, don't do it. i propogate MY vibe.
and i offer people an alternative. they can hang wit me or wit the
crackheads. but why would they hang with me if i insult their
intelligence and act, well, 90210 SNOBBISH? we gotta set a better
example than this petty drug bullshit.

	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STOP BITCHING ABOUT DRUGS

when you were 16, 15, 18, 19, 21 when did you listen to someone just
because they said "trust me. listen to me. i've been there"? 

	HAVE WE FORGOTTEN OUR YOUTHFUL NATURE?? are we gettin old and stagnant?
are we turning back to what WE were shown as kids? ie UNACCEPTANCE. ie
not RESPECTING someone unless they do exactly what you do and are
EXACTLY on your level in life?

	WE ARE THE BIG BROTHERS.

		it isn't important if someone is perfect or is living a holy drug free
life. what matters is the morals they're working TOWARDS. none of us
will EVER meet our full moral expectations. but we know that the
important thing is the SEEKING of truth and reality. so i believe that
cats can live in (what others would call)"SIN" but still be 100% whole
hearted good people who are better than unaccepting straghtedge coffee
drinkers-chocolate eaters-pork eaters-pot smokin-blowin thru yellow
lights people that seem to forget theat their shit *sniff sniff* HEY IT
ACTUALLY DOES STILL STINK!!!!

	coming down on other people os like a self defense mechanism to not
deal with your problems. so maybe i'm wrong to come down on those who
come down. but i'm still learnin.

	2 yrs ago i wouldn't even be thinkin bout this. it'd jus be "well i
don't agree with them" and i wouldn't have thought of the higher morals
involved. and i'll bet in two more years i'll pick up even more from
conversations and life. but no way am i gonna pretend like i know it
all. that's like saying "I'M DONE GROWING. I DON'T HAFTA THINK." to me
that is the ULTIMATE waste of human potential. to me it's the same thing
as kids caught up with drugs, except it's worse cuz it's EGO. 

	so now you can all email me about how wrong it is to complain to people
about bitchin at people. i just wanted to stimulate some thought for
those older folks who A)got out of drugs and expect the whole world to
follow or B)never got into drugs and expects everyone else to change.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STOP BITCHING ABOUT SILLY DILLY CHEMICALS

we've got so much more

need i even say, PEACE LOVE UNITY RESPECT.

I'd like ta mention about side effects of lsd. most studies (look in 
psychology today or some journal like dat, i forget) agree that LSD 
psychoses (the baddest side effects, including flashbacks but goin to 
schizophrenia) are triggered by LSD but are already there. They 
paralleled it to stress and ulcers/heart attack. you may already have a 
body succeptable to heart attack, stress from a job triggers it, but the 
job didn't cause it.
	so some cats will become out dere
	some cats return unharmed after YEARS of tripping.

	there is a good point made here, we have to think how OTHERS see 
this to understand their reaction. of course i don't see much wrong wit 
what mos cats do. but i always gotta remember their perspective, even if 
ya don't agree wit it, be able to think like them so you can give them 
points and info.

	information flow requires a receiver in order to be effective.

	we can be effective. esp. w/primative receivers ;)

I would certainly support some form of large scale organized gathering.
 
Though, let us learn some lessons from the earlies generations and recent history.

While we can't force the american public to genuinely accept everything we are,
we might be able to convince them to listen to us and give us some space.

Polititians pay close attention to any large groups that organize enough to
gather in large numbers and speak with a common voice.  This is how one
begins to exert political muscle.

To really work on this, we must develop it, clarify our objectives, and 
expand to the wider rave community using zines and flyers to spread the
word.  Supporters in each area can cover the copying costs using their own
resources or donations.

I can certainly cover much of the Pittsburgh/Cleveland corridor.

Peace,

Philip

Why not simply let PLUR stand for 'Peace Love Unity Respect'

Wouldn't that convey what the scene stands for better ?

i don't mean to sound like a spoil sport, but give me a break here... what
exactly are we "fighting" for?  the right to dance & listen to music?  we
have that already.  it is the drugs that are forcing police intervention
on parties, not the music & the dancing -- people forget that drugs are
*illegal* & you are going to have a hard time convincing politicians of
anything if you do not have some sort of "cause" i.e. human rights,
environmental issues, etc.

every subgenre of music that has had a large young adult following has had
its share of problems; metal had the satanism tag, rap has the gang tag. 
raves have the drug tag.  yes, it would be nice to have a large anti-drug
pro-music, pro-scene party, but that's all it would be.  how do you expect
to get political backing if the rave scene doesn't have a cause of some
sort?  every flyer i've ever received about a party says "no drugs" yet
you see cracked out individuals everywhere -- why would this party be
different?

welp, IMO it would completely defeat the purpose of what the demonstration
was supposed to be proving.  i mean, we are not talking about pot here.  we
are talking about coke, e, heroine, meth, etc.  these will *never* be
legalized.  these are the reasons clubs are being shut down and parties are
being busted.  the demonstration was supposed to prove that we are
responsible and not a bunch of junkies.  Now it seems to me from other
people's posts that there is nothing wrong with rolling "once or twice a
week."  can one honestly say that when there isn't even enough studies on
the long term effects of e?  i say no.  anyhow, that is another subject.  if
the point is convincing the public that ravers are not about drugs and more
about *music* and and equality, how would it look if they were all arrested
for possesion of legal narcotics?  you make the call.

Actually, we don't. In most major metropolitan areas, you are taxed to
excerise your right to peacefully assemble as guaranteed by The
Constitution. This includes permits, fees, inspections, that sort of
thing. You want to march? Get a permit, or get arrested in most major
urban areas.

What I am feeling is that the "you're a haven for druggies" quotation is
now being used by the government in cooperation with the media to single
out raves in the equation of : drugs + dance_party = bad. Our entire
undergroundish feeling which we cherish is something very foreign to
people outside our merry band of dancers. When's the last time you went to
a regular mainstream dance club anywhere and -didn't- see some idiot
getting high? Drugs are all over, and once again the "majority" is
fantasizing that they can get rid of the problem by getting rid of the
parties. This is what has me ticked off... The whole attitude of "What we
do not understand and thoroughly investigate we will destroy."

What we're really fighting for here as a group is to hang on to something
important to us specifically, but important in general : our eroding
rights as citizens of the United States of America. 

"We are Congress of Borg. Resistance is futile. You will be legislated to
death."

i would rather my stuff not be mixed on this tape, for much the same
reasons.  i have ~15-20 mins in 4 songs that i might just send the whole
tape and let you's pick the ones to use.

>to master it on cd like pete said would probably be the

i would like to have a cd or 2 for myself, might even be able to sell a few
up here at cedars.  been getting a few requests for tapes and what not ...
oh, if i had a quarter for every person who wants a copy of o fortuna ;)

well everyone seems to think its a pgh tape.  pete (i think) mentioned it

it ;)

Awww... cool..  think of the movie quotes that can go on the walls...  
The Lawnmower Man, for one.  Oh, ever see the promo tape for Autodesk 
Animator?  About two hours of incredibly kibo graphics.  Stuff from 
movies..  full movies..  would look really groovy on a big wall.

Whoa..  I just had a vision of six DJs all mixing one record each.  Real

Summary of stuff:


1)  All submissions for the tape should still be sent to me at=20

	Jim Gourgoutis
	c/o GALT Technologies, Inc.
	Suite 750
	5001 Baum Blvd.
	Pittsburgh, PA  15213-1851

Again, EMAIL ME BEFORE you send stuff (skoop@galt.com) so I know to =
expect it.  Put the subject "TAPE COMP" in you mail.  If you send =
multiple tracks, state which one you'd most like us to use, in the event =
we only have space for one track per submission.  Keep tracks to a =
reasonable length (ie. under 10 minutes).  I guess that now we're =
accepting either cassettes or DAT tapes.  (Tea?)

2) The tape will include people from pgh & cleveland, since that is the =
scope of this list.
It seems as if there are many people from both places that are =
interested in this.  Keep in mind that we've only got 60 minutes to work =
with!

3) Once I get enough submissions, I will drop them all off with Tea, and =
he will be in charge of doing the mastering/mixing/whatever. =20

4) Submissions will not be returned unless specifically requested and a =
proper (ie. padded, whatever) SASE is enclosed.

5) Anyone who wants to do a J-card for the tape should do so, and then =
when the time comes, we will get them posted on the web somewhere and =
vote on them.  If you're seriously going to do a j-card, email me and =
put the subject "J-CARD" in your mail so I can set up a list to keep you =
updated.

6) Tea wants to put the final mix up as a Realaudio file at his website. =
 I think this is an excellent idea.  Anyone who doesn't want their =
track(s) included in this should say so when they submit material.

7) We need ideas for the name!=20


Finally, I just want to say that I'm glad and excited that this is =
happening.  I've had a hunch that there were others in the area who made =
music, and it's great that people are crawling out of the woodwork and =
(hopefully) founding the beginnings of a network.

I can also help cover Pittsburgh and Indiana county and (indirectly)

Cool ... that sounds like the plan then.  Like I said, I don't mean to mix
things together very much, I just have an aversion to much space between
tracks.  I mean, that's what raves are all about, right ... a continuous
flow of music!  Sure, there are different styles over the course of the
night, but a good promoter organizes the evening so that there is a
purposeful order to the music of the event, I'd like to attempt the same
on this comp. Everyone who is willing to come to Pittsburgh to the 'PTS
studio and listen to the selections when they're all here is more than 
welcome to help decide what the order should be.

> its hard to tell whether all of our styles will be mixable.

true, but how different are all the styles of techno, anyways.  When you 
think about it, Jungle, House, Ambient, Breaks, Goa ... there are common 
elements to all of these.

That's great.  So, for the cost of burnin' a CD, you're willing to make 
CDs for people then?

Sounds about right.  Prolly closer to $15.

Let's see how this comes together, and if turns out nice, I'm *very*

Excellent point.  J-Card makers should try and keep room on there for 
a tracklist and email addy's for all artists.

Well, is he/she on the list?  I'd like to restrict this to PB-CLE list 
members only, but that's just my opinion...

I wrote this whole thing out before, and of course I forgot a couple of =
things:

1) Tentatively, there is going to be one side mixed, one side not.  =
Please indicate preference or "don't care" when you submit material.

2) Currently, it's undecided whether or not the compilation will accept =
submissions from listmembers ONLY or not.  Tell us what you want people! =
 Personally, I want the tape to contain stuff from the pb.cleve area, =
and I don't care if it's from people on the list or not, since I want to =
foster a network/community of regional electronic producers.  I want =
everybody to know everybody...that way we can all work together and make =
good things happen. =20

3) Regardless of musical *styles*, submissions should be of electronic =
music ONLY.  No guitar-rock bands, please. =20

4) Again, we need a name.  Email me your idea, and we'll have a vote =
later.

thanks,

Summary of stuff:

	Jim Gourgoutis
	c/o GALT Technologies, Inc.
	Suite 750
	5001 Baum Blvd.
	Pittsburgh, PA  15213-1851

Again, EMAIL ME BEFORE you send stuff (skoop@galt.com) so I know to =
expect it.  Put the subject "TAPE COMP" in you mail.  If you send =
multiple tracks, state which one you'd most like us to use, in the event =
we only have space for one track per submission.  Keep tracks to a =
reasonable length (ie. under 10 minutes).  I guess that now we're =
accepting either cassettes or DAT tapes.  (Tea?)

2) The tape will include people from pgh & cleveland, since that is the =
scope of this list.
It seems as if there are many people from both places that are =
interested in this.  Keep in mind that we've only got 60 minutes to work =
with!

3) Once I get enough submissions, I will drop them all off with Tea, and =
he will be in charge of doing the mastering/mixing/whatever. =20

4) Submissions will not be returned unless specifically requested and a =
proper (ie. padded, whatever) SASE is enclosed.

5) Anyone who wants to do a J-card for the tape should do so, and then =
when the time comes, we will get them posted on the web somewhere and =
vote on them.  If you're seriously going to do a j-card, email me and =
put the subject "J-CARD" in your mail so I can set up a list to keep you =
updated.

6) Tea wants to put the final mix up as a Realaudio file at his website. =
 I think this is an excellent idea.  Anyone who doesn't want their =
track(s) included in this should say so when they submit material.

7) We need ideas for the name!=20


Finally, I just want to say that I'm glad and excited that this is =
happening.  I've had a hunch that there were others in the area who made =
music, and it's great that people are crawling out of the woodwork and =
(hopefully) founding the beginnings of a network.

Regarding the mixed side how would this be done?  Are you going to get
dubplates of the tracks done and them mix them or is this going to be a
more  or less "sound on sound" beatless mixing ala AMP? As far as a name
is concernedthe pb-cle region is neither the East Coast nor the Midwest,
it's more like the place where the two meet. The middle land or Midland.
So how about we call it Midland Mayhem?

wow.  I tell ya, if you guys are gonna get some dubplates made, let me
be the first to volunteer to continually mix the tracks.  One of my
favorite things to do is have a friend pick ten records at random out
of my collection and try to put them all together in a coherent set.
I'd be super super super super into mixing this tape thing, as I have
had a lot of practice in trying to blend a variety of styles.
Besides, I love all different kinds of music.  I think continuously
mixing this comp is a great idea, and I'l die to be the one to do it.
I was thinking about submitting an ambient/noise experimental track,
but if the tape is only 60 minutes (I think it should be 90) then I
don't want to take up somebody elses space on the tape with my crap :)
But, like I said, I'd LOVE to be the one to mix the tape.  

p.s. Joe... you never emailed me back about the airhorns... I'm
leaving next Friday...

Calm down man. One of the biggest problems when organizing anything on the
internet is that a small simple idea (ie a compilation tape, a protest of
a local police department, etc) mutates into a grand all-encompassing
project that usually falls under its own weight. I've seen it happen many
times. The Breaks-list tape, the NE/MW/DC-raves MegaRave, etc. Too many
people get involved, too many people want to broaden the issue to include
their political ideology, too many people want to make a simple tape into
an "any thing goes" type thing. There is much to be said for the
expression "Keep it Simple Stupid". If you an't handle the fact that
somethings have limits then you need help.

Chill man, no big deal if that's not your bent on this.  All I was 
suggesting was that this be a project for members of the PB-CLE Raves 
list, since all of the debate is occurring on the internet, what's wrong 
with making the tape a collection of all of the friends and artists we 
know on/thru the internet?  I do believe that's how it went when NE-Raves 
made a comp a year or so ago.  Jeez, no biggee...

Wow, first you say you want to make a tape that is as detached from the
rave scene as possible, then you say "my original idea was it was an
anti-DJ thing.. im sick of superstar DJ's.. Dj's who make super $$ to
spin.. it ain't that hard", as if DJs have no talent or artistic quality. 
If you're so anit-rave, why *are* you subbed to a rave list, then? 
I agree with you that the comp should showcase the producers in the area, 
that's obviously the intent of the tape, but to deny the importance DJs 
have in the scene is ludicrous.  If there are no DJs, then who is gonna 
spin your tracks?  How can you have a party if there is no one on the 
decks conducting the show?

oaky soooo where does this take us>?
do we need to audition now to be fair?
whose the judge?
we certainly cant have everyone that makes tracks and their friends to be
on this tape... sorry =/

but how bout we tell non pb-cle-ravers to send the tapes/DATs to skoop and
if theres extra room he can perhaps accommodate.
sound fair?

HAPPY VALENTINES DAY EVERYONE!!!

1. Personally it doesn't matter to me if it is mixed or not.
2. If it is going to be mixed then perhpas the tape should be organized by
style. For instance if the tape ends up 60% drum & bass/jungle and 25%
house/techno (around the same BPM of course) and 15% other then like
tracks could be mixed together. THe tricky part would be how to match
tempos when you aren't dealing with records.
3. Dubplates are fairly cheap and would provde a simple solution to the
problem above. Sure they don't last for ever but they need notsince they
are going to be used 1 time, to mix the tracks.
4. If there is a lack of tracks from pb-cle-raves listmembers and we have
room then and only then would it make sense to open it up to anyone from
the area who wants to submit something.
5. Remember, this idea started off as just a "Pittsburgh Electronica"
project which then because the pb-cle-raves tape. Now some think it should
be open to anyone who wants to submit. Beware of "ideacreep" it will kill
your project quicker than anything.

No, obviously we can't make dubs of all of the tracks.  This may be too 
soon to get into this, seeing as how the discussion is already getting 
people upset, but all I'm suggesting is this:  'PTS has an 8-track 
digital tape deck.  It's like a 4-track home studio a lot of people have, 
except it's 8-tracks and samples the source at 44.1K 16bit sample rate 
(CD Quality). (The machine is a Fostex DA-88, similar to an ADAT, but it 
uses Hi-8 tape).  Anyways, all I'm saying is that we can take the tracks 
that people submit and stagger them accross the tracks on the DA-88,  So 
track one is on channel 1, then the next track (whatever that would be) 
would go onto channel 2.  Hopefully people compose their songs in such 
a way that they have an intro, and middle and an end.  Or, in the case of 
ambient/noise/industrial tracks, no beat for a little bit in the 
beginning.  All I would do is fade out track one and fade in track 2 
before the next beat came in.  Obviously we can't beat match, although I 
can change the tempo of individual tracks on the machine so I could get 
things fairly close in tempo before mixing.  But if people are so worried 
about the purity of their tracks being altered, I won't even do that, and 
there can be "dead air" between each song for all I care...

> So how about we call it Midland Mayhem?

That sounds like a good name to me.  Kinda suits the discussion thus far :-)

I like this idea.  I will accept submissions from anyone in the pb-cleve =
area, but people on the list get first priority, if we begin to run out =
of room on the tape.  When you submit tapes, specify whether you're on =
the list or not.

Word.

I've said this often and I will say it again: DJ'ing and Producing are
like two sides to the same coin. With every form of dance music (notice I
said dance music not ambient) it is no suprise that most of the top
producers are also DJ's. While they may not all be house hold names they
atleast have a handle on the skill involved in mixing. Why is that?
Because the music is for the most part DJ oriented so in order to properly
produce it you have to properly understand it. That's why almost every
good producer has a couple turntables to play around on if nothing else.
DJing and Production are linked. Were it not for the Producers what would
the DJ's spin? Were it not for the DJ's what would be the point of
Production? Or put another way if a tree falls in a forest and there is no
one around to hear it does it make a sound? ;)

Ok, we need a name for an organization to represent our scene.  Why not simply
name it PLUR = 'Peace, Love, Unity, Respect'

So call the organization 'Peace, Love, Unity, Respect'

If PLUR is the essence of the rave scene or the ideal, let it be our name.

Some have remarked that it is strickly a net concept.  While I don't know the
precise origin, I first heard of PLUR on the street and at parties.  Many people
with no connection to the net know, embody, and spread the PLUR message.

my thoughts on the project:
   i agree with most everybody else that this should be kept
as SIMPLE as possible.  Meaning, pb-cle only, unless there is 
room left, which i doubt there will be.  as far as mixing goes,
i think that it is more trouble than it is worth (for this project).
dubplates would take more time and money to do.  putting the
masters on a digital 8 track would possibly work, but you 
would only be able to put 4 songs on there if you want
to retain stereo quality (i may be wrong about that though).
the voting on j-cards sounds like a good idea.  and info on the
artists (name, email, etc...) would be very important on the card.
i won't be upset, no matter what happens...and i don't think there
is any need to.  lets keep this fun please.

i also like simple names and would be happy with 
"the pb-cle sampler", or "pb-cle electronica".

love,
ryu

I would also add that this connection is sometimes made the other way
around, with production artists (like Underworld, I believe) branching
out into djing. 
After mixing long enough, I think most djs would like to move into
production, as they generate their own creative ideas for tracks (and
sometimes become dissatisfied with what is out there...) 
More importantly, I think that this movement is necessary for the scene,
by having underground artists who are in touch with what is going on, we
have a continuous source of music that is for the most part untouched by
the big record companies (at least for the vinyl side of things.)

> (notice I said dance music not ambient)
Well, I do know a couple of people (out on the west coast) that do other stuff:
trip hop artist lo phat hi fi is also a dj
 at existance records (they've done production work for freaky chakra)
producer mike kandell also does the dj circuit on occasion

<mix it up, because that's the strength of our scene>

How much do dubplates cost?  I might be able to throw a dollar or

check out www.groovetech.com
basically, it rocks- they've got quite a lot of dj mixes (45 min long or
so...) they're mostly west coast trance-house, but you groovers might
find them interesting

To all concerned-
As far as who can be on it - I think it oughta be open to those in the 
pb-cle area but not restricted to those on the list. It seems the idea 
here is to get exposure for the area and the people in it. The pb-cle 
list is a convenient way to connect but I think the more music the better.

>LeSesne@m-net.arborn

i would just like to add though that the producer/dj marriage is not always
a successful one. there are dj's who for the life of them can't produce a
half decent track (Terry Mullan) and producers who for the life of them
can't match a beat (Juan Atkins, DJ Hell, Super Dj Dmitry).

i think, also, that these might be the exceptions that prove the rule (that
production and dj'ing go together). i think production is a very common
thing for anyone, especially dj's, to want to get into. and then there are
obvious advantages to understanding dance music after being a dj. on the
flip side a producer has an advantage also being a dj in that all he/she has
to take with them to get their music out is a sack o' rekkids and not
$15,000 worth of equipment to do a righteous PA (that figure is probably
quite variable, depending on if you are Joe Bedroom Producer or Orbital).

personally, i have respect for anyone who can do wicked shit on either side,
but my leanings are more towards production.

Oh screw this bit.
It's not about PLUR.  We can't even maintain "plur" on this damn list.  
Just about everyone I talk to mocks the whole plur movement, including 
myself.  Music.  MUSIC, kids!   I don't go to parties to be nice and 
loving with everybody.  THIS ISN'T REALITY.  

If you want to get all political about this "movement", or so you call 
it, be realistic in your motivations.  If you make a demonstration in 
Washington (cough) and base your argument upon, "we're here to represent 
peace, love and unity" you're going to be fucking laughed at.  The media, 
local governments, and the like are not concerned with niceties, they're 
concerned with the WELFARE of society.  Kids are overdosing, running away 
from their homes, acting like total ponces in general.  

PEACE?  LOVE?  UNITY? RESPECT?  Yes yes, lovely.  That's what we call 
utopia, huh?  No one practices it with realism.  I'm a fucking cynic and 
I know it, but I also pride myself by having a realistic viewpoint on 
things.  The hippies did nothing in the 60s but smoke a lot of weed, 
refuse to shower, and had love-ins to protest the Vietnam War.  They 
drove VWs, also.  I don't think that the rave movement is unified in 
this way, however.  It's so fucking cliquey.  Daily I sift through 
bullshit arguments about David Bowie being a sellout, K being a great 
drug, blah blah you get the point.  No one seems to agree on anything.  
That's life... People are different.  The world is different than you, me 
and that bum on the corner.  That's what makes things beautiful.  Accept 
that.  

hahah this really didn't address the issue I intended.  Oh well...

In the case of plur, sort out my jumbled thoughts from above and consider 
this quote from our long-haired friends, Megadeth.

"Peace sells, but who's buying..."

I never though I'd find solace in a heavy metal lyric.

More to come later.

"peace"...

the best price i've found is about $35 for a 10", which I assume could
be 2 sided (although I only got one side, so I could be wrong).  I've
heard of mythical places in the Caribbean which press them up
for"quarters."  Though, the truth to this I do not know....

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com

Hello fellow net-ravers!

DUNE is a direct result of the SOCAL-RAVES list.  A group of us wanted to give
something back to the scene that we had enjoyed so much.  DUNE is the result. 
April 5th will be our third DUNE and were extremely excited about it.  

We just confirmed an AMAZING location in the beautiful Southern California
desert.

We'd love to have other rave list members join the rest of us (2,000 people at
the last DUNE) under the stars.

Be sure to let me know if you'll be coming out so we can introduce you around.
Hope you can make it!  The party will only be $10!

Thanks,

Brad

point of production? hopfully you do cause you loved it..
not cause you want to guy to mix it at a party.. you produce for you and
anyone who wants to hear it..  and you can perform live.. joe. you your self
play live there for eliminated an need for a DJ..  i can produce my tracks,
and be happy, but i can not play live, and its eating the hell outta me.. to
me thats so important , to be able to play live.. so people can enjoy/or
dislike. your music.. well being made by you.. i would much rather rave all
night with small breaks cause everyone is a live PA.. thats better, their is
more energy.. more excitement.. may not be continuisly mixed. but its live
right then.. that rocks..

I have a question!!!what do you do for a party that you think you should
get in for free??? Does passing our fliers get  you in for free???
shouldn't we be happy to help promote in order for the promoters to
continue the parties!!! we do this for you!!!!!!!some promoters do it to
pay bills, we put every dollar into the next party hoping to make it
better>

     we have been called greedy!!! i don't understnd this!!!i help setup
, door, promote, whatever and i pay for parties that aren't ours,
shouldn't his be the attitude!!!
     I thought we were giving people good times but a "friend" feels we
are greedy and sincehe/she hands out fliers they deserver something.

melissa,

here are the reasons that we let people in to our parties for free and the
reasons i feel that people should get in for free:

1) they helped us out with setting up/ cleaning up for/after the party

2) they invested money in our party

3) they drove a d.j. to/from the airport

4) they let us in free to their party(one comp deserves another)

5) they are coming in with a dj (within reason, no in state dj deserves 5
guests, you know what i mean?)

those are all i can think of for now, but if i think of more i'll tell
you. of course, we don't make our best friends pay to get in the party,
but most likely if they're our best friends, they've helped us out in some
way. we also give discounts to those who pass out flyers for us, if we
gave them the permission and the flyers. we are usually more than willing
to let someone that is stuck for money in as long as they are willing to
do us favors in return(i.e., staying to help clean up).

maybe this will help you. no need to get upset, just tell them like it is,
if we let everyone in for free, then how would the party happen? give them
an idea of what you pay for, maybe they don't know.

Ok, I'm gonna make some assumptions here.  

Lets say theres 74 minutes of music on this tape thats being planned

Lets say a 12" can fit 2 songs of each length 7 minutes...

We'd only need 5 12"s for 10 songs, as long as the songs were put on
the right sides of the records for mixing purposes.  So, assuming all
this is true, that there are only 10 songs on the tape, thats only
about $75 for the dubplates.  I'm SURE we can raise the money to front
that and then make it back in tape sales.  Hell, I'd be glad to donate
a small chunk of $$ up front to get the dubplates made, assuming that
I'd mix the tape (boy, can you tell I'm eager to do that!? ;) and that
I would be compensated with tape sale return $$ for the money I
invested.  I say go with the dubplates! :)

IF it is decided that these songs should be mixed and distributed as
mixtapes (as a supplement or compliment to the actual compilation), it
would still be cheaper to mix two CD's of them together than to do
dubplates [duck].

X-radio is a phat site but it seems like the playlists are the same?
And you can only get like three songs on the trip-hop category. But
like the house one has around ten songs.  Its stell a cool site though.

this is all too much work and too much money. i don't think tape sales are
going to make any money to pay back dubplate pressings (much less any other
costs), and i am not sure either about the draw of mixed side(s) of a tape
that is supposed to feature producers. i know i would not want any song(s)
of mine that might be selected to be mixed with any others.

agree.. you guys already have enough music .. do a tape now .. you can do
the dub-plates later .. + if some dj hears a song on this preliminary tape
and wants a copy, s/he can request additional dubplates be printed up when
someone decides they are going to get around to doing the $15 dubplate job

All -

   Anyone from near bouts pittsburgh considering going to *Snowdrift* in
Columbus next Friday?  Sounds like a killer event - lots of variety
(plenty ov jungle plus some ambient & experimental stuff you don't get to
hear to much round here)...plus lots of dj's I personally havent heard.
Being as I have no car, I'd love to hook-up with some kind soul headed out
there with extra space.  If not, I'm trying to get transport with some
non-list kids - I'll repost if I have a ride with extra space.

On the pb-cle list tape - sounds good - I think with all the talent around
it should turn out to be quite good.  I would suggest the it not be
actually 'mixed' - since you're trying to feature production, but I'd get
it either way.  I would definatly help with distribution/promotion of sed
tape - so keep the list in the know of how its going.

Another note - did anyone happen to pick up a small rag-type zine called
"Iron City Underground" recently?  It has listings of pgh-area
shows/events pertaining to its 'underground' music/art scenes, as well as
reviews of records, shows, little rants etc...  The first issue was mostly
about punk stuff, but the guy putting it out seems pretty cool and wants
to cover other scenes - rave, goth, etc....and is looking for reviews,
submissions, etc.  I'm writing some stuff for him, and forwarding listings
for upcoming partys, but he definatly could use more enthusiastic
contributers.  Anyone interested, email me and I can pass on his
email address.  Did I mention it's free (a la the city paper, inpgh)?  

l8s,
 geoff

Hey all... I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm going to be down 
in Oakland tomorrow near Pitt and CMU, so if anyone is interested in 
getting a ticket for the net party, write back and we can set up a time & 
place to meet... and I'll be checking my email at Pitt tomorrow, too, 
so... if you don't get this until tomorrow, fret not.  :)   :)  

BUT... time is getting really short, and I'm probably going to be pretty 
busy Tuesday through Friday... and Friday I'm leaving for Philly where 
I'll be on my way to the net party... so your best bet to catch me is 
tomorrow!  :)  Unless of course, you can make it downtown and meet me at 
work.  Heh.  :)  They're still $8... and if you wanna sticker made with 
info about yourself, email caz@coos.dartmouth.edu  :)  

I guess that's all... hopefully I'll get to see some netfaces tomorrow 
down in Oakland.  :)  *hugs hugs hugs*  Latah!  :)

#1 Did anyone tape AMP last night? I need a copy of it.
#2 Did anyone listen to Radio Carson last night (91.7)? Every Saturday
night they have a really good mix show with local DJ's. Sine, Dust, Eric
D, 7-Up and myself among many other were on last night. We got quite a few
calls as well. This Saturday there will be another one and also one on
89.7 (Free Radio Pittsburgh/Rinse-FM)with an assortment of your favorite
local drum & bass wizards.
#3 Did anyone from this list go to RAW? How was it?

melissa sed:
=================================================================
I have a question!!!what do you do for a party that you think you should
get in for free??? Does passing our fliers get  you in for free???
shouldn't we be happy to help promote in order for the promoters to
continue the parties!!! we do this for you!!!!!!!some promoters do it to
pay bills, we put every dollar into the next party hoping to make it
better>

     we have been called greedy!!! i don't understnd this!!!i help setup
, door, promote, whatever and i pay for parties that aren't ours,
shouldn't his be the attitude!!!
     I thought we were giving people good times but a "friend" feels we
are greedy and sincehe/she hands out fliers they deserver something. 
Thank you is plenty we appreciate EVERYONE WHO HELPS!!! 
Please respond, i want to know hat kids think!!!!
MELISSA
==================================================================

ok, first off i would like to say i am the person who expressed
discontent passing out the flyers for the party in question and
i will explain why:

case in point #1: superfly 1 - i passed out over 300 flyers in
the cleveland area (probably taking up 3-4 hours working time
and $5 - $10 gas money). posted about their party on the plrm
party info-line. i brought down two car loads of kids including
one of the dj's who spun at the party (jinx). and the promotor in
question, charges me full price even though i had spent
a good deal of my time and gas money promoting for his party,
getting kids to come out to his party...the ironic part was he
did not charge a certain 'girley' friend of mine who i had
also brought down...needless to say i was a little 'miffed' that
i was charged full price after doing all this work for him for
free and my certain 'girley' friend was let in without any payment
simply because the promotor in question was attracted to her!

case in point #2: afros macs and zodiacs - again i passed out over
300 flyers in the cleveland area (even took the abuse when kids
made fun of the flyer because it was dorky looking). again i posted
about their party on the plrm party info-line. again i brought
down two car loads of kids and even drove one of the dj's (cylert)
to the afterparty when the people who were supposed to take him 
there left his ass and again i was charged full price.

(other partys deleted due to repetition)

final point: i have the new return of the superfly flyers...and call
me a moron, but i find very little incentive in passing them out due
to the past lack of appreciation with the promotor in question...a
few more tidbits that made me arrive at my decision:

1) the flyers were delivered w/ the following e-mail letter: 'i need
   these flyers passed out in cleveland and akron. and don't give me
   no bullshit about letting you in for free.' no thank you for your
   past help in promoting on your info line, passing out flyers, 
   bringing down kids, driving dj's. just do this for me. and don't
   give me no bullshit about me still charging your ass at the door
   after you do all this for me again.

2) the plrm info line is not listed for cleveland...the ironic part
   is the spawntaneous line is listed...not only does the spawntaneous
   line have no mention of the party, but they plan on throwing a party
   on the exact same date (hmmm can u say listing info lines w/o asking
   the promotors!)

3) i know the girl who did the flyer for them and she was also a little
   'miffed' because they forgot to list her phone number (for flyer design
   contact) in addition she has still yet to be paid for her work.

the odd thing is the promotor in question used to be my friend, i used
to drive him to toronto, to baltimore, to delaware, to philly, all over
when i used to do bus trips (i had to quit when kids refused to pay me
back and i lost so much money)...it was even my 'zine that inspired him
to do his own 'zine...and he is the only promotor that i have dealt with
that does this...i understand how all promotors want to do is break even,
so every dollar counts, but taking advantage of your friends by making 
them work for you for free (either passing out flyers, helping setting up,
tearing down, or driving dj's around) is just plain unethical...it is
taking advantage of some one and it is even worse if they are your friends.

on a lighter note i will give shout outs to promotors that i have
dealt with that have been appreciative of my efforts...

steve of psychoactive and chris from spawntaneous...i passed out
over 3000 flyers in toronto, rochester, syracuse, and columbus and
they kept their word by comping me @ the door

brian and lee of UPS...for helping promo family affair one and two

scotty and ian of the church in cleveland for Saturn (way back in the
day!) 

tim and frenche-e of evolution & maxximum in louisville for teknosaurus 2

J2 of untranslatable in lexington for interstellar outback 2

brian of the sugerkids for origins in youngstown

mary of zap for one in columbus

asya of dose for 241 in toronto

patrick of phat-o for mars in syracuse

lonnie of ultraworld for vibration in baltimore

matt & jill for all the EPT partys in akron

mike of holiday productions for nutcracker in cleveland

farquar of jericho for freak show in dayton

rick of fuel productions for daedalus in pittsburgh

kevy kev of network 23 for proton in columbus

doug of ele mental for generator in columbus

carol of girley girl for north coast bomb in cleveland

ryan of g-force for think in cleveland

joel deadly buddha for soul in pittsburgh

trevor of zenith for love bomb in delaware

(sorry if i may have accidentally left you out)

...these are the true promotors that i have dealt with and will continue
to help support 100% due to their common courtesy and appreciation of the
little people.

=================================================================
        Did anybody go to the thing in Kent on Friday at the Robin Hood? I
had to finish up some programs for class and couldn't make it.  Just
wondering how it went down.
MIke
=================================================================    

yup, me, christa, jeff/stuff, & his girlie made the one hour trek
from cleveland to kent to check out 'The New Style'...we were s'posed
to hook up w/ lady ms. lisa & her buddy from cleveland also, but i
guess she got lost or sumptin...

yeah call me a moron but i even brought down a stack of 'return of
the superfly' flyers eventho i said i wouldn't!

shout outs to joshua, matt, jamie, and the whole love light crew for
giving us props @ the door! sorry i didn't get a chance to skool u @ pool,
but i hope the brewski made up for it!

welp jeff/stuff didn't get to spin cuz i brought him down too late
but we did get to catch pulserver and synapse. synapse had a few
skips but his acid trax more than made up for it - actually made
me dance for a li'l bit (rarity these daze). and pulserver has 
improved much since i last heard him.

but the highlight of the evening wuz the neat-o lasers that shot
across the room. there wuz this image of this woman grooving to the
beat that i thought wuz particularly well done.

Even bobby & the ill style rockers were there representin!...reminds
me i gotta post about their upcoming partys later...

it wuz good to see some other ole faces that i haven't seen in awhile...
brian from ups, amy, john, drew, beckie, george, jamie, we even bumped
into greta/elias who we ended giving a ride back to strongsville (little
did we know it would take us a half hour out of our way...but it wuz all
good!)

all & all a good time wuz had by all & i'd recommend it to everybody
cuz the drinks are cheap and the atomosphere is cozy (very reminiscent
of club Deformed in youngstown) plus joshua & the whole love light cru
need all the support they can get (after The First) so they can quit
living off of PB&J!

Well it sounds to me like you're just dealing with some shady ass 
promoters... if I got a note like that with fliers to pass out, I'd 
pretty much dump the fliers in the trash... Passing out fliers and 
getting into a party for free is cool... but it's all common sense... 

If a promoter asks you to pass out fliers and you do, that's cool... then 
it's just common courtesy for the promoter to let you into the party... 
unless the party is a benefit or something, I can understand... No prob.  
But if you offer to pass out fliers, then I wouldn't really ask to get 
into the party for free... it's like you're saying "alright, I'll get 
word out of the party..." then I wouldn't complain about not getting in 
without paying.  

This last case, though... well, that's just not right... :/  Oh, well... 
as long as there are people, there are bound to be shady ones.  :P

if you weren't at Gaia this saturday,
i hope you had a fun time doing whatever
else there was to do, because i had a blast!
Gaia was a great success (it seemed that way
to me anyways).  the place held a nice and 
friendly crowd.  most people were dancing to 
most of the music.  no aggression that i noticed.
just a great party.  state college has potential,
and if Gaia is a forshadowing of the things to
cum, then i may just take an extra semester
next year!

love,
ryu

==================================================================
        Damn sounded like a pretty phat party for lil old Kent, Ohio. And to
think it was less dan a mile away and I didn't even go? But school is
sometimes more important than some good tunes on a Friday night........ who
the fuck am I kidding I should have took my lame ass down da street instead
of writing some stupid program! Aaaaaaaagh. I'll check da next one though.
Peace
MIke
=================================================================== 

bullshit! i stayed home saturday night instead of going to BOOTY LUVA
cuz i've got a big test this monday! u did the right thing, like i told
kate, there'll alwaze be another party but u've gotta have your priorities
straight...school before partying! if yur not gonna look out for your
future, who will? 

let's put it this way...

what good is 'well i went to every rave in ohio from '94-'96' and i own
every record off of cajual & relief' going to sound to the interviewer
when yur out looking for that job that's s'posed to pay for your rent,
your food, your bills, your car, your family, your future?

unless u plan on becoming a starving dj/techno recording artist, i 
don't recommend skipping your homework for the next big party...
like that ole saying goes it's a nice place to visit but you don't
have to live there...

yes! gaia was a big success:)
the space>>
PHAT...nicely setup, two rooms of sound and a big chill room inbetween and
a smoking sort of lounge next to the main room as well..the main room dj's
were behind glass to give maximum dancing space.the linoleum tile that was
laid down however was only taped and only survived until about 2am when
bubbles starting forming underneath and they got bigger until we had to rip
it off ..there was rug carpet underneath and it wasnt as easy to dance to
after that:(..its all good though..just hope they perhaps make the tile
either permanent or more firmly in place for next time....thanks once again
to mike and tim and all who were responsible to lend the space out..they
look foward to future events too:) big +

the lineup>>>>
main room>>very large, not enough bass or volume (next time i think theyre
renting more bassbins) seemed to work better forthe house and trance, less
ofr the jungle

*101 went on first from harrisburgh..he seems like a pretty chill guy..i
know his brother:) he spun all progressive house, perfect for warming up
the dance floor (no one was really there yet, much less dancing) i liked
his taste in music, new age type melodies and chord progressions, nothing
that minimal. he played one track though that pissed me off just becuz im
working on a track that uses the same chord progression :P i hate when that
happens.

*JASE was up next.. he just went to 611 to get new a bunch of new rekkids a
couple days in advance and had a very unique set..i look forward to
watching him grow as a dj cuz he  puts a lot of heart into what he
does...go jason:)

*RUFFIAN showed up 20 minutes after he was supposed to spin, but its all
good cuz mike/stick got to play 4 songs interim that i seemed to like.
ruffian had a two hour set, the first hour was all hard house (this is when
people were showing up and the dancefloor was getting *riPpEd Up* )..the
second hour was very good drum and bass, i could definately hear that
pittsburgh flavor although i lack the words to describe it..props to him
for rocking the party during the party's build up.:)

*SMOOV played from 2-4. during his first hour there was a decent
break/showoff circle going on and poeple were really getting into
encouraging everyone else to show everyone their styles, as different as we
all are:) after 3am people starting leavin (suckahs) and  i dont remeber
much of his sencond hour.

other main room dj's i forget..k-oz spun hip hop and a little jungle
towards the end of the night, no one was really dancing after 5am though

second room>>this gave the opportunity for some locals to get exposure on
the decks, kerri from oil city spun some really good gangta style jungle
beats, CES-1 spun some decent funky breaks *im getting sick of funky breaks
though)

props to mike/stick for spinning in the backroom whenever neccessary as
well as tagteaming with electric monk, but i seemed to have missed that set
altogether *shrug, i was getting tired)

AFTERHOURS>>all 6 of us!:)
i had a great time all night and stayed way until the end, and i even
conducted an afterhours in penn states music technology lab with us
diehards , which i felt inclined to do since most of them were from new
jersey and had no other place to chill out...it was nice to have an small
intimate audience while i worked on tracks to get instant feedback, (too
bad i didnt record it *arggg*, since most of the dynamics came from
modulating effect parameters on sequenced drum and ambient melody loops,and
will never be heard the same way again...but its ALL good)

im interested to hear how venus and raw went off...
later peeps.

i like one mixed, one not.

Personally, I want the tape to contain stuff from the pb.cleve area, and I don't care if it's from people on the list or not, since I want to foster a network/community of regional electronic producers.  I want everybody to know everybody...that way we can all work together and make good things happen.  
hm. i'm in favour of pb-cle listmembers only. i think it's a cooler idea.

well, eno and the klf (or, more precisely, the klf sampled eno) used pedal

hey erica and amie and the rest...since afk and others in pgh have been
really spotty in promoting local events, and more and more parties in pgh
are dropping to the house party level...would it be possible to spread this
'word of mouth' information out way (with all respect to the
promoters/hosts wishes+intentions, of course)..if they want it on the down
low, then cool, but otherwise, let us suburban kids have the 411...:)
thanks...

peace,

What is Jungle? 

                                         by Julian Carow


Jungle is a form of underground dance music that comes from London and the
rest of England. Its main characteristic is that it
uses a "breakbeat" instead of a straight "boom boom boom boom" 4 to the floor
beat. These days the beats are chopped every
which way possible. While the beats move at around 170 bpm (by comparision an
average house tune is around 125 bpm), the
basslines are moving at half speed (85 bpm), making the music perfect to bop
your head to. These complex polyrhythms
makes jungle one of the most complex forms of music today with influences
from every other style of music imaginable. Jungle
first gained mass popularity on the rave scene in 1991/1992, utilizing sped
up hip hop
"breakbeats". At this time, it was known as "breakbeat", "rave", or
"hardcore". Tempos were
around 140-145 bpm. Key components of jungle during this time are piano
breakdowns and
sped up vocal samples (think of the Chipmunks :P ). Typical tracks from this
era are tunes such
as Manix "Feel Reel Good", Acen "Trip II The Moon", and Dance Conspiracy "Dub
War".
Many '92 hardcore songs such as Smart E's "Sesame's Treet", The Prodigy "Out
of Space",
and Urban Hype "Trip to Trumpton" became commercial top 40 successes.

1993 was the year that hardcore began to get more varied with different
styles being made. One style known as "darkness" or
"darkside" used less pianos and more darker sounding chords. Examples of
classic darkside tracks are Boogie Times "The
Dark Stranger", Rufige Kru "Terminator", and Origin Unknown "Valley of the
Shadows (31 Seconds)". Happy tracks such as
DJ Force & The Evolution - "Fall Down on Me", Cloud 9 - "You Got Me Burnin
Up", and Krome & Time - "The Slammer"
were also big hits as well.

                     1994 was the year that jungle got very big in the UK and
the rest of the world. DJs such as Sy,
                     Slipmatt, and Seduction continued to play happy hardcore
which by then was becoming its own
                     separate style. Most DJs such as Rap, Fabio,
Grooverider, LTJ Bukem, Mickey Finn, Hype, and
                     Darren Jay were playing what was now being called drum &
bass and jungle. The trendy word
                     became "jungle" which the press seemed to jump on as a
label. Often jungle was a name
                     synonymous with ragga - tracks with reggae samples and
at some times full on vocals. Examples of
                     these tracks are Conquering Lion's "Code Red" and the
infamous M-Beat featuring General Levy
                     with "Incredible." Still a lot of tracks proved to be
anthems without using any ragga influence ) tunes
                     such as Engineers Without Fears "Spiritual Aura", Deep
Blue "The Helicopter Tune", and Higher
                     Sense "Cold Fresh Air".

During this time jungle went through a tremendous surge of popularity, with
several tracks charting in the top 40 in the UK.
Large jungle events such as AWOL, World Dance, and Desire were packed. Common
themes at these event were live MCs
such as GQ, Det, Five)O, etc. who complimented the music and hyped up the
crowd who showed their enthusiasm by flashing
lighters, and blowing air horns and whistles.

1995 witnessed the insurgence of the "dread bass" named after the classic
track by Dead Dred. Basically it is a very
pronounced bass line that gets its sound from "reversing" a normal bassline.
By the summer of 1995, ragga had pretty much
died out. Tracks such as "Hearing is Believing Remix" and "The Lighter" on
Formation Records as well as L Double - "Bass 2
Dark" and Undercover Agent - "Oh Gosh" were massive tunes. Over the summer
and fall, artists began using more and more
hip hop samples from artists such as Wu Tang Clan and KRS-One. This style of
tracks with deep basslines and jump up flava
became to be called "hardstep" or "jump up".

At the same time, the mellower and jazzier side of drum and bass and also
gained popularity. By the end of 1995, it had gained
widespread media attention and the music that had been shunned by most of the
press all of the sudden was now the latest
"trend". Influential in bringing about drum and bass' popularity were two
club nights in London ) "Speed" on Thursday nights
with resident DJs Fabio & LTJ Bukem and Metalheadz' Sunday night at the Blue
Note. 

1996 witnessed yet another major style develop ) a return to the darkside.
Artists such as Ed Rush, Trace, Dillinja, Nico, Doc
Scott, Dom & Roland led the start of "techstep". 

Today there are three major styles: "hardstep", "dark", and "mellow / jazzy"
although they are just general categories. A lot of
tracks fall in between. note: I'm currently trying to sort out a better
explanation
about where the music's at right now...hold tight.

Good ?  first it depends on the promoter(s) and what their intentions 
are and how they deal with the money thats made
    -are all the DJ's paid
    -light guys paid
    -sound guys paid
    -security paid
    -is the tech crew given a place to stay after they tear down the 
party if their from out of town
    -is the promoter gonna throw another party
    -does his main income come from consessions

after anylazing the promoter and his intentions then you must look at 
yourself and see how much TRUE ENERGY you've put into the party cause 
thats whats ganna make the party, the energy ppl put into it. Theirs 
been parties that we've(lovelight) have done for chitty promoters 
where nothing at the site was ready and we were form out of town and 
didn't know anybody there and had to do alot of chit that should of 
been done before hand like clean put plastick on the windows tell them 
how chit should be set up where to put trash cans and so on. And at 
these type of parties i felt no remorse about letting 10 ppl in the 
back door for free. passing out flyers is a big part of the whole 
picture but if those 1000 ppl you gave flyers to donn't show up then 
ya haven't made that great of an influence and maybe your engergy 
wasn't focus right! but if ya do drag alot of kids to the party then 
your intentions must of been good cause you were giving of a vibe to 
ppl that made them say "damn this is gonna be a PHATT party" and they 
came.
  like i said before DIY write about mayday in akron 
       "ya only get as much energy out of a party as you put into it!"

peace

Subject: May Day in Akron

     The end of the semester was here, summer was almost ready to begin, 
and the kids were ready to get it on.  This wasn't your typical May Day 
party though.  In the past(every May Day), your typical party concisted 
of lots of kegs, lots of fights, and lots of ingnorance, and your 
traditional couch burning at the infamous Kathryn Place block party. 
Which is usely followed up with Akron's finest deck to the T with full 
riot gear and yes folks plenty of tear gas for everybody.  But this year 
we the kids got together and showed Akron U. how to really party. 
     It started out with G-Force Prod. boyz wanting to play some tunes 
some where. So I said "Hell lets do it at my crib I live right smack in 
the middle of everything."  And then the funky Rev. George and Skunkworks 
Sound showed up with a couple of thousands of watts of sound and the 
music began.  For a several block radius all you could here was the bump, 
bump of the funk.  And next thing you know we had a party goin on.
     Channel 3 of Cleveland even swung by to check things out.  On the 
news they should a keg party across the street with a bunch of chump's 
standing around with beers in thier hands, and then they pan across  the 
street to our party of a large group of more evolved species groovin down 
to some of the phattest tunes ever heard on TV(you know that social 
programming devise).  
     Now it was time to reallly get it on the sun was going down and 
LOVELIGHT LASERS was in the house.  With a 30 ft. mesh screen in between 
the house, a 1 watt argon lasers kickin, 4 roboscans, and some special 
pyrotecnics, any one even near just had to stop and see what in the world 
was going on. Was it an invasion, was it a physics project, NO it was 
Akron's first free outdoor rave.  Every that walk by was first a little 
sketched out but the vibe was so intence that they couldn't help but sit 
there beer down and come up and dance.
     The best thing of the night was the fact that every one had a good 
time, no fights, no bond fires, and no tear gas.  Thanks to APD for not 
shutting us down till 4PM. I could not belive it.  Also special thanks to 
all the DJ'S who showed up for FREE!
        Rev George(Skunkwerks,Akron)
        Matt(the lone ranger,formly of A.A.A.A.,Akron)
        Dew-Bee(G-Force,Akron)
        Synapse(?)
        Gank(Clevland)
        Yopu(G-Force,Akron)
     This just goes to show that you'll only get as much energy out of a 
party as much as you put into it.
                                      PEACE,
                                      SUPER FREAK

This is the Directions if you're coming From Pittsburgh / Toronto / Buffalo /
Ohio area

If you're coming from Philly / NYC / NJ / Boston / Binghamton / Syracuse area
These are the other Directions:

Get on to 90 going towards Buffalo ... Exit 45.  take 490E to Exit 16.
 Clinton
At the 6th light make a right onto Pleasant.  2nd Block turn right onto
Liberty pole way
Venue on your Left up ahead parking everywhere.  Usually there is a guy
charging some $$ at the parking lot... He's a White guy ... kinda heavy set
(he works the lot)  If anybody else tries to make you pay... Don't take that
shit.. Usually there's some black bums trying to get some $$  Don't Give them
a penny  (I'm not being racist here) Just looking out for out of towners.

SHALOM!!!!

		sorry i've been busy. i was in a car wreck a few months ago and am
gettin sued. so i've been dealin wit my insurance people and a whole lot
of stress. but here's the update for anyone who missed it. 

		PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY

		will be held in Akron Ohio at a later date to be announced SOON AS
FUCK. we decided to give ourselves more time to organize over 150
people. We have people confirmed to speak out to voice opinions. We are
currently contacting DJs interested in being involved and being on the
flier. This is a combined effort between Akron, Cleve, Columbus, and
Pittsburgh. we want all interested DJs to come, speak, an spin
afterhours if they want. So now we need to think about a date that won't
be conflicting w/other cats parties.

		I saw the response our pittsburgh friends got from the ACLU (they were
told to start their own organization) and we decided to change our
attack. he letter going to the ACLU now will have eyewittness accounts
and the emphasis will be on establishing legal precedence (sp?) so we
won't have the same thing they had in the UK. So we aren't calling on
them to address a problem in Akron Ohio anymore, we've taken it to
another level. 
	MAN THIS SUXXX TAKIN TYME!!!! i hate waiting. 

		i jus wanna bitch at someone in straighforward language for once
without the runaround. Thank Jah for email addys to my senator. at least
i can vent like that every few days.

	so next step is the flier to be printed on the net and at Kinko's. the
flier will be dateless. but i'd love suggestions for a good, open,
Saturday date!!!!!!

Hey,

Anyone planning on going to Erie for Mr. Yumma this saturday? It supposed to
be a good party, with pretty good line-up, and for only $10. What more do you
want? I know that there is a net party in Rochester, but that's additional 3
hours away, plus it's supposed to be ina club too. What fun is that.

I guess their guarantee about the weather will hold up (check the GRID or
anywhere else where the party was posted if you don't know what I mean).

Lots of my friends from Cleveland, Pittsburgh as well as Rochester are
planning on going. I heard that there is even a bus trip from New Jersey.
That's phat.

I am quite new to this mail list and th whole Pb-Cle scene, and just wanted
to see whether any of you will be going since I didn't see anyone mentioning
this party too much. I'll be the tall kid with a rad hat. Maybe I'll be able
to met some of you.

Peace to everyone and see ya in Erie.

by the way...


is anyone from the pitts area going to this party?  my friend and i
REALLY REALLY want to go but we're not quite sure if our ride is going
to pull through, so just incase does anyone has two extra spaces in car?
we're willing to help pay for gas, tolls, etc.  we're really friendly
and we don't bite.  i'm even willing to bake muffins or something for
the trip. 
(how can you refuse that?!?!)

thanks,
amy

=================================================================
hey steve ya want me to kick this guys ass :)

chillin illin never dealin

SF
=================================================================

uhh no that's not necessary, the funny thing is yur not the 1st
guy who offered to do this for me (but u are bigger then him)...

actually i wanted to apologise for my li'l outburst...i made it
much too public and am currently resolving it a li'l more privately
...the promotor in question duz throw decent partys and duz care
about the scene (unfortunately he cares about it so much that 
sometimes he neglects his friends & that's basically all it really
was).

on a lighter note...brian rauschenbach (sugarkids) formerly of 
youngstown now residing in seattle just sent me a package w/ a
buncha flyers & stuff and he wanted to give a shout out to all
his rave buds in ohio & pittsburgh and to feel free to drop a
line @ his new addy:                             

brian rauschenbach 
1512 summit ave #203
seattle, wa 98122

he says he's chilling w/ his boy dj roman from seattle & if
any promotors are interested in booking a dj from seattle to
give him a ring @ 206.587.9408 and he'll send out his new tape:
ROMAN: no excuses - a mixed result. i've got a copy of the tape
& must admit it's pretty decent, but the west coast sound is
very different from the minimal detroit midwest sound...more
electro slo breaks & acid...vibe music...reminiscent of the
ole scott henry progressive house style but much more eclectic
w/ tribal and dub flavah...i guess u gotta hear it to understand
it...

...i gotta get some sleep from studying all last night...

some of you have suggested a netmeet at bob evans after the party, which
is a great idea except for the fact that there is no bob evans anywhere
near the space.  but there is a tee jay's very near to the space, about 8
blocks or so.  i know tee jay's isn't the greatest but it's right there
and it's pretty cheap.  those of you who aren't familiar with tee jay's,
it's basically the greasy spoon version of bob evans, and for vegans there
is a wonderful dish called FRIED MUSH which is a must-try (and it's
actually good!). 

that's one idea.

a second idea is to bring food and cook it at the space!!  yes there is a 
full kitchen!  (anyone who came to CARBON already knows that ;)

ahhh...the days i used to make waffles after parties...

i hope someone takes advantage of the kitchen this time.  could be fun!

i am extra extra happy now since i read the messages about where
snow*drift will be. the space also has my highest recommendations, for
1 of that size. also last nite i thought of the best idea for party
favors. it is a surprise but here are your clues: 1. they fit the
theme of the party. 2. each one is unique. so i will have them with me
at snow*drift. mw-raves/pb-cle-raves people plus other people i know
get priority, after that they are 1st come 1st serve. if you don't
know me yet, i am 5'5", i have straight brown hair about as long as to
the middle of my ears, + i will be wearing phat dark blue pants with
white stripes on the sides, a long sleeve silver shirt that says
"speedo" on the front, i don't know what shoes, & possibly a hooded
black sweatshirt and/or a fluorescent green sunvisor. so say hi to me!
see everybody there...

I just thought I'd let ya know I'll be performing live on Feb 28 at Pitt
University in the Scheneley Room.  The only catch is you have to have a
student ID. I am unsure of the cost but it goes to a good cause, it's a
benefit for Johnny Gammage's family and their case against police
brutality.  I'll post more details as I get them.

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Years before the music press ballyhooed techno as the post-grunge big deal,
rave was an outlaw culture. Location To Be Announced is an art exhibit that
collects the flyers that served as the passkeys to the secret all-night
warehouse happenings. SPINonline's Darren Tuozzoli gets down with the art
of what's going bump in the night.

It's no secret that dance clubs create a sonic maelstrom of techno beats,
house bumps, and ambient fuzz that tend to move folks' hips from
side-to-side. Yea, they dance. If this unique energy that we dub "modern
dancing" could be harnessed and translated into a design movement, what
would it look like? The walls of a planetarium laserlight show? The
marquee-jumpsuit of Bootsy Collins?

Josh and Keith Brown, two ordinary citizens who enjoy the pop-art scene,
know exactly what it would look like. They've been collecting rave flyers,
party invites, club advertisements, and record sleeves for years, and often
thought about creating an exhibit in the name of underground partying. The
realization of such curatorial aspirations is Location To Be Announced, a
traveling collection of club design, cultural artifacts, and dance beats.
The exhibit was launched by the Browns [no relation] at the Exquisite
Corpse artsite in Burlington, Vermont last year. This March, the rave
kitsch collectors are taking the show on the road.

The LTBA collection contains a vast array of representations from different
dance culture epicenters, though most are from the U.S., England, and
Germany. The show begins with a single sheet of handwritten directions to a
party, and then unfolds with rarities such as a simple 1985 Run DMC club
ad. "These pieces of rave culture really trace the evolution of desktop
publishing," says Josh, "because in the time frame of less than 10 years,
these flyers went from one-color xeroxes up to six-color, hi-res prints
with custom ink mixes." While some of the pieces look as bombastic as a
Crazy Eddie ad campaign, some transmit an air of complete intellectual
coherency. The most impressive flyers use the imagery of vehicles and
industrial props that are graphically joined with feeling of the music,
creating a malleable, iconographic insignia. The Washington DC-based
Airline Industries created the "Buzz" logo that, when coupled with their
abstract monorail and spaceship graphics, obtained instant street
recognition. The British-borne "Cream" propeller logo has also achieved a
similar icon-like status. Whether it's a computer-generated image or a
scratchy sketch to illustrate a simple point, the images do nothing less
than brand the retina.

Like a perfectly intertwined pack of firecrackers, club flyers catch your
eye, exploding with information, only to be left in the gutter when the
night is over. In the purest sense, they are disposable pieces of art on a
level with rock posters of the 60s. When producing these circulars, time is
major factor on the designers' minds. Because of the nature of the
business, a lot of the work has to be accomplished with a quick turnaround.
"A promoter might call these people up and say, 'I need a flyer done, we
need to print tomorrow. Can you finish something tonight?'"

Competition continually pushes their work envelope as well. When promoters
hire someone to do a flyer, they are hiring a marketing strategist--someone
that will, ultimately, be hawking their event on the street level. In which
case, a lot of designers are going above and beyond what the last person
had accomplished, out-doing each other, in an effort to create a niche for
themselves in the business. "Amazingly, most of the works are created by
young kids at home on their Macintosh," Josh quips. "They're kids, but they
are doing high-level, amazing design."

A subculture follows the music, underground parties, and lifestyle, while
design hounds and pop culture in its entirety will undoubtedly follow these
flyers. With the growing popularity of electronic music and rave culture
beginning to peek out from the underground, this sleek design aesthetic is
redefining our means of communication. "There already is a horde of
mainstream advertising in circulation that was obviously influenced by rave
design," Josh adds. "I was just watching TV the other night and saw this
toothbrush ad with these wicked, flying graphics--stuff that was definitely
inspired by these guys, this music. It's out there."

[The Location To Be Announced exhibit is available for rent through the
Exquisite Corpse gallery, but in March will embark on a month-long tour of
the U.S. with Boston-based DJ Liquid Todd. For further info on the exhibit,

	This is the second annual NE-Raves hosted net party.  The direct
purpose of this party is to unite all the members of the cybertribes through
association.  As net ravers we are a unique penomenon.  We are rapidly
becoming the next targets of cultural exploitation.  The totalitarian media
industry is trying to model the images of our scene to fit their agenda. 
Unfortunately for them, information is being distributed to the free-thinking
masses by means the dinosaur-media cannot control.  We are not what they
would like us to be.  We have the power to express ourselves.  This party is
a celebration of the technology that is changing the way the world sees
itself, the way the curious learn, the very technology you are using right
now.  We bring you Yahoo. 

Tickets are available for direct purchase from the following:
(8$ presale  10$ door)

	NYC - John Speakman (speakman@hyperreal.com)

	Buffalo - Sarah S.(sarahs@buffnet.net)

fund all the extra tech-goodies we have planned for you..  ; )
 
(note: these are not normal tickets, they are laminated, individually
numbered, flyer-style tags made with the intention of being kept forever. 
They will serve as an "admit one" and are considered tickets in every way) 
Netters (sorry to the friends of netters) may also order personalized
stickers which are meant to be fastened to your ticket.  If you would like

The purpose of this posting is to help educate people about 
possible solutions for impotence problems and a new method
of treatment.  Since this problem affects 30 million American

If you or your sexual partner experience impotence problems, either
occasionally or frequently, reading this short message may very well
change your life for the better.  Even if you're just looking for some

extra "hardness" you will want to read this info. 

After several years of research and development we are proud to
announce the availability of a totally new product to aid people with
impotence problems.  It is called the "Hercules Erection Strap" and is
unlike any erection aid product you have ever seen for sale.  It is
the most effective and most comfortable method of transforming partial
erections, weak erections, and early failure erections into rock hard
erections like you used to have. 

How does this product work?  Well, it assists in trapping the blood
within the penis (a natural function) by applying very firm yet
comfortable continuous pressure where you need it most - at the base
of the penis along the top edge and the both sides.  The strap is worn
around the upper portion of the penis and around the waist and is
totally adjustable to any individual's penis size, weight, and
pressure preferences.  

But don't make the very big mistake of thinking this is just another
cock ring or other type of constriction device that blocks blood flow
because it is not like those pain inducing devices.  Unlike those,
this strap does not completely block off  the blood flow which makes
it much more comfortable to wear because the pressure doesn't continue
to build endlessly.  It does not apply pressure to the bottom of the
penis which would tend to block off ejaculation.  The strap can also
be used with a condom, plus it is lightweight, portable and fairly
discreet.  Its soft cotton and nylon construction make it infinitely
more comfortable than some hard plastic or metal "cock ring" device. 
You and your partner will definitely appreciate the comfort. 

This product was developed over a period of more than two years by a
man who himself suffered from impotence problems.  This individual
tried every cock ring, erection cream and other erection aid known
(except surgery) and wasn't satisfied with any of them - so he created
his own solution.  That creation was the prototype which eventually
became the Hercules Erection Strap which is now available to the
public exclusively through mail order at the present time.  We
strongly believe it is the best erection aid on the market and WE ARE
WILLING TO GUARANTEE IT OR YOUR MONEY BACK.

You heard right, if you are not satisfied you can send it back for a
full refund.  No other erection aid on the market will make that
guarantee.

But we do not claim that it will work for everyone in all cases and
that is why we want to give you a money back guarantee.  This way
everyone can try it to see if it helps them without taking any
financial risk. 

We believe the strap will work for anyone who is capable of having at
least some sort of erection, even if is only a weak erection for a
very short period of time.  The Hercules Erection Strap will help
transform a weak erection for a short period of time into a strong one
for a longer period of time. 

However this product will not likely help those people who are
incapable of producing any erection whatsoever at any time.  Nothing
short of surgery will probably help in those cases.  

But the vast majority of people will see great benefits with this 
product.  Once you try it you will never want to be without it again.
Even those who usually have no problems either than occasional
failure will want this strap for those times when failure occurs. 

We are not asking you to pay for the product at this time.  Instead,
we would like to mail you more information about the Hercules Erection
Strap that includes some diagrams which illustrate exactly how it
works, why it is so superior to any other erection aid on the market,
and more information about the probability of it working in your
individual situation.  And remember we offer a full money back
guarantee if you eventually choose to purchase the Hercules Erection
Strap.

We are only 4 days away from this Saturday.

Due to the overwhelming response and interest for this party, we have
made a last minute change to a larger and extremely more appealing
venue. This will ensure that everyone is accommodated properly and has
more space to enjoy the music.

The location will be in the vicinity of the Erie International Airport.
We have obtained all legal permits, zoning, and occupancy papers in
order to allow the event to go on. In order to allow speedy entry, we
are making this a map point event. The location of the meeting point,
where tickets can be purchased and the venue location given, will be
announced 24 hours prior to the party on our info line (800) 991-5301.

If anyone has any questions, or needs any more information, please
e-mail me, or contact us via the info-line.

Rest well for the remainder of the week, and make sure you are in great
shape to stay up long and dance on Saturday.


Till later,

Greetings from the folks at Liquid Sound Distortion

<chainsaw buzzing in the distance>

Yes yes yes...  but what does this have to do with raving?  A little 
extra stimulation in the middle of a groove might be a good thing, but 
it's easy to forget about mechanical stimuli and hence, cause permanant 
damage.  Raving with a woody...  sounds painful.

	...from me).

		Poot and I will be heading over to Rochester tonight to 
help get everything ready for the big weekend.  Assume that I cannot be 
reached by email after 5:00 pm today.  If you still want to order a 
personalized sticker and haven't done so yet, send email with your info to 
danny/tranced (tranced@gate.cybernex.net) until he makes a post to the 
lists saying he can't take anymore (which may be soon).
  
	I'd like to just mention a few things before I end this little 
post.  First off you are all rad as hell and I'm proud to be part of this 
whole scene.  To the new schoolies: as netters we are all very educated 
about the ills in our scene and I think we would all like to cure them.  
Remember to use your head, behave, drive safely, and above all have a blast 
this weekend.  To the old schoolers:  Don't forget how important a sense 
of unknowing curiosity was to the best times you've ever had.  Yahoo will 
be different from Mosaic, but just as good if not better.  Don't let 
yourself get caught in the same "back-in-the-day" set of expectations 
that have hung up your good times in the past.  Be friendly, dig the 
music, show the new folks how to be, and above all have a blast this 
weekend.

Actually, it makes quite a bit of sense to me.  This was a most humorous
reply to some rumor regarding Suzanne Terhorst's identity and purpose for
participating in the scene.  Rumors fly about constantly regarding undercover
agents and informers.  Most of the accused seem to be simply new to the scene
or out of favor of one clique or another.

At various times I've been accused of being a cop, FBI agent, CIA agent,
KGB agent, police informer, drug dealer, etc.

Oh, I'm also supposedly 'trying to destroy the scene !' according to various
and sundry area promoters.

All this while either running a weekly event or throwing parties including
the largest ever in Pittsburgh.  I give away a lot of candy and sometimes
fresh fruit at parties in this area and a bit further east.  And even more
serious, I actually enjoy giving backrubs.  For such heinous crimes against
humanity, and the scene in particular, I most certainly deserve to be cast
as an arch villain in the eyes of all ravers ;)

Should anyone miss dripping sarcasm above, I've never been an agent of any
governmental or non-governmental body with any interest in the rave scene
whatsoever nor partaken in any of the other malicious/illegal activities
attributed to myself.

Peace,

Philip

hey phill i always thought you we're a MARSHIAN SPY ;)

yea what is up with the paranoid freaks runnin around lattely, is our 
scene so skechted and shaddy that we have to look at every stranger with 
super caution and shaddness. Esp. those who have done alot for a 
particular scene just cause they get hasselled alot for sticking out to 
help keep our scene underground. Thats one of the best things aboout 
this scene is that its underground, we keep to ourself's, and we have no 
enemies.  IF PEOPLE WOULDN'T TWEKE THEIR MIND'S SO HARD THEN MAYBE THEY 
WOULDN'T BE SO SKECHTED OUT BY EVERYTHING.  if thier's someone who you 
think is  a cop go up to them and play undercover raver and do research 
on them by talking to them before talking shit to other people.

PEACE

	This is really scary folks.  Someone broke into my email account 
and posted that message about yahoo being cancelled.  I have no idea why 
someone would want to be so malicious to myself and the rest of us but 
the fact is that YAHOO IS STILL HAPPENING.  If anyone hears any more 
rumors or anything else about yahoo being cancelled it is 100% false.  
Yester Johnnyu told someone that he got a message from me saying that 
yahoo was cancelled and that he recieved this message from me.  Today I 
almost accused him of lying on Vrave.  I checked my sent messages to be 
sure and there was no message sent to Johnnyu from my account.  There 
wasn't however the message sent to the lists did in fact come from my 
accounbt meaning that the security of my account has been tampered with.  
If you have any question about the validity of yahoo continuing call 
flex's info line 1 (716) 234 VIBE.  Since someone has broken into my 
account once they can probably do it again and fuck shit up for 
everyone.  I doubt they could break into flex's info line.  Regardless of 
this really nasty trick some asshole is trying to pull on all of us I am 
still really looking forward to seeing everyone at Yahoo and know that 
it's still gunna be alot of fun..  = )

WHAT?@! YOU HAVE TO BE FUCKING KIDDING.

If this is true, we are taking our vans to a party in PA, Yumma. The
promoter will give us cheap tix. I'll look into this.

	Okay folks here's another interesting development on this whole 
some-one-wants-to-fuck-up-our-good-time at Yahoo issue.  Eric and several 
other net slueths I've been talking to on Vrave discovered the following 
about my impersonator.  If anyone has any idea who this is please let me 
know so we can all destroy them...  (do I sound angry?)

Not exactly.  It looks like someone made a direct connection to the
SMTP server on coos.dartmouth.edu from pm1ip1-albny.albany.net and
said they were you.  This is a common and long-standing SMTP
vulnerability.

People whose mail readers allow them to see *all* the header lines can
check for this...

	Real caz has a header item looking something like:

Received: (from caz@localhost)
          by coos.dartmouth.edu (8.8.4/8.8.4)
	  id SAA10393; Thu, 20 Feb 1997 18:42:58 -0500

	Whereas caz's evil twin has header lines looking like:

Received: from [206.72.193.32] (pm1ip1-albny.albany.net [206.72.193.32])
          by coos.dartmouth.edu (8.8.4/8.8.4) with SMTP
	  id SAA08359; Thu, 20 Feb 1997 18:14:31 -0500

I'm sending this post to a great many mailing lists, so I apologize for
the insane product of crosses I'm sure I'm committing.

As I write this, 3 brand new mixtapes of mine are being dupped off at the
facility on the other side of town.  Why 3?  Because I haven't done a new
tape since August '96 and I had a lot of catching up to do.  :)  I've been
away travelling Europe from September to January, so these tapes largely
showcase the new material I acquired over there, and some newer stuff
still that I've gotten since I've been back.  3 tapes because each
communicates it's own genre, which I will get into now.

	dd10 - "Conscious of the Moment"
The last pure, hard minimal techno mix I did was "Entrance" from back in
August '96 -- this one is long overdue.  Starts at around 140, ends at
around 150.  The tracks are dark, hard, minimal, thought provoking, and
sometimes injected with a little funk.  These tracks invite the ass to the
dancefloor while they spark images in your head about abstract theories.
The tape contains manual realtime frequency manipulations during
multi-source blends.  It starts hard, it ends harder.  This is *not*
hardcore.  The best techno the world has currently to offer is
represented.  Highly percussive.

	dd09 - "Two Undercover"
The followup to last July's "Undercover."  More of that vibe, which was
lush instrumental deep warm loungey jazzy soulful *feeling* house music.
It never rises above 130.  This is what electronic soul means to me --
with a little added to it.  Some acoustic instruments like live bass and
horns; a little strings added here&there.  This series is turning into a
concept.  This is my house of the future.  It's not *only* about dancing.
You can sit back relax and feel the provided soulful entrees.  The track
selection was executed with the utmost care.  There is so much bad house
out there.  These are my diamonds in the rough, and I really love this
music.  Mostly new, with one or two classics injected into this new breed
of depth.  Drive, love, dance, sit, sleep, eat, talk, walk, netsurf to it.
London, New York, Chicago, Detroit, Berlin, Austria, France, Sweden.
4-4 beats are still the dominating force on these 90 mins.

	dd08 - "Nightrain To Berlin"
Last October I took a night train from Paris to Berlin.  It was my first
night train experience.  A friend of mine lent me an ambient mixtape for
the week.  This mixtape became the utter soundtrack of that experience.
Of all the electronic DJing and mixtapes done currently, the idea of the
ambient mixtape has been hugely overlooked.  I realized this when I heard
this tape, in the middle of nowhere, trusting the train to take me halfway
across Europe at 4am.  Most of the pieces on this tape are either not beat
centered or are beatless entirely.  The sounds are abstract,
environmental.  Moods range from dark, threatening, inspirational,
beautiful, strange, surreal.  Sources include turntables, a microcassette,
CD, and a VCR.  The sounds aren't only records.  The collage is a
deliberate expression.  I hope to change some of the ways the convention
of the mixtape is thought about with this project.  Again, largely new
music with a few old wise ones placed in.

All of my tapes are recorded onto a digital source (DAT), and duplicated
professionally onto custom-cut chrome BASF 90 minute tapes by the
facility on the other side of town.  All tapes have art on the lables
themselves and come with full color Jcards independently designed by a
professinal flyer artist.  In other words, the shit is legit.

$10 for one, $18 for two, $25 for three.  This includes shipping.

Bascially, anyone can send an email using any SMTP server.  For example, I
am on Mindspring.  I can send an email using most any SMTP server I
wanted.  So, I could change my email address to markymark@hot.com, use
their SMTP server (mail.hot.com) and make it look like I am Marky Mark
(how I wish)

However, the place you are sending the email from will put your current
machine name, path, etc...  So, even tho I look like Marky Mark from
hot.com, I am still going to have mindspring.com in the headers..

So, the person who sent this email is from Albany.net, and I don't recall
anyone from Albany.net except for one person.  So, confess now and
apoligize, before we flog you.  Me first!  Me first!!

I don't know that there's any aktual raves goin' down IN pgh this
weekend...there is Mr. Yumma in Erie, but that's kinda far.

If you'r looking for stuff to do, try Laga in oakland on Friday night -
its usually pretty fun if you like house & breaks & a clubby atmosphere.

Something really cool is going down Saturday up on Dusquesne University
Campus (downtown) - there is an all-night show to benifit Food Not Bombs.
Lots of good local bands - everything from pop to punk to ska & metal, and
afterwards they'r having djs - I'm not sure who.  I heard they might even
have open decks.  And the best thing is its in a GIANT BUBBLE!  Yes, they
have a big plastic bubble covering their football field and that's where
the event will be.  Check it out - I'll prob be there if I don't go to Mr.
Yumma.

l8s,

i went to the space today to scout around the kitchen and see what kind of 
tools we'll have to work with.  here's a partial breakdown:

- full stove with tons of burners (8 or more!)
- oven
- pans, cookie sheets, and baking stuff
- plenty of counterspace so we dont accidentally mix the onions with sugar
- a locked refirigerator (presumably it's locked because there's stuff in 
  it, i will ask permission to use it but bring ice/coolers just in case)
- full sink

i suggest that someone (perhaps several of you) ought to bring disposable
plates, utensils, and cups, as there are none there.  oh yeah and napkins
too. 

tony ramos will be setting up some fun games and stuff in the dining room, 
but we'll have it all out of there by the end of the pahtee so we can use 
the dining room to sit and have our little breakfast.

directions forthcoming...

i'm not 100% sure, but i heard that this was cancelled...i'm on CMU
amnesty international's mailing list...there was going to be an amnesty
table set up there...but we were told the event was cancelled...so it
might be a good idea to double check with dusquesne or something before
you go...

I got home this evening and checked my answering machine to find that
I had just missed a call from Caz.  I returned his call immediately to
find out from him that someone had impersonated him and his account to
post that Yahoo was cancelled.  Caz personally assured me that
everything was still 100% on and that people on the list were working
to find the individual responsible for this fraud.  

Then I logged on and read through all of the messages that have been
posted concerning this dupe and it has got me thinking a bit about our
community and this technology we take for granted every day.  

My first reaction (and Caz can attest to this) was fury.  To think
that someone would have such selfish and petty aims as to attempt to
thwart a party that we've spent the past four months preparing for
with great anticipation just made my blood boil.  But this rage soon
turned to faith.  I quickly remembered that our community is too
closely knit and too strong to let one lone miscreant spoil this
party.  This fake post has only served to strengthen our group and
make us relish this party even more.  I know, as I'm sure the rest of
you do, that this party will be something for all of us to remember
for a long long time.  It will be a night filled with great music and
the smiling faces, hugs, and warmth of friends old and new.  It will
be a party that we will cherish.

After thinking a bit about this whole thing, I began to wonder if
there is any way to find out who the culprit is.  I mean, if there is
a way for a hack to impersonate Caz at Dartmouth from a foreign
server, who is to say that the person at the foreign server was not
also the victim of an impersonating outsider.  I know painfully little
about internet communications and SMTP or any of that mumbo jumbo, but
what I'm getting at is who's to say that the chain stops with one
impersonated account?  I'm sure a decent hack could make it look like
the original sender was anyone they pleased.  So let's not jump to
conclusions because the line may not stop where we've been lead to
believe.

Finally, after even more pondering, I realized that even if we never
learn who did this, it won't really matter all that much.  When we're
all together on Saturday night sharing in the vibe that runs so deeply
within our family (and I do consider you family) this little incident
will lose significance.  It will fade away with time as a little quirk
in a series of events that led up to this event.  It will not be
remembered. What we *will* remember is the love, respect, music,
and friendship that was shared on that night in Rochester.

I'll see you all Saturday night.  Like Flex, I request that you please
come up to me and say hello at some point.  

Peace!

Hugh

hey there,

i just recieved the new Musician's Friend catalogue and i noticed a new
Roland JP-8000 synth.  this seems to be their answer to the Nord Lead, but a
bit more expensive.  does anyone have any info or experience on this thing?
does is do a good job at simulating analog like i hear the Nord does?
apparantly some techno producers are already into the Nord...Mike Dearborn
being one of them if i'm not mistaken.

there was some discussion on analogue heaven a few weeks back about the
jp8000.  it was shown at the NAMM thing (instrument manufacturer showcase
of sorts) and most things were generally positive that i heard.  lee from
akron said he really liked what he heard in 20-30 mins on one. of course on
AH, everyones bitch is that it wasnt analogue, go figure?...    trouty.

Hi:
I are new to AOL and the internet.   I am  not trying to spam at all.  In
Fact,
I have no idea you wrote or did these songs.  A friend of my sent them from
me from AOL that i met in the rave  chatroom.  Since this songs were rave
related, I decided to send it to the rave list.  I was trying to be nice by
sending it to the rave lists and sharing them with my fellow ravers.  I have
no idea what bandwitdh is.  I also know that i  AOL, if you do not want to
download something that you can simply hit the 
"cancel download " button.  Also, when i was sent this , my mail server( what
ever that means) did not crash, nor do i have a limited quota on how much
email i can get in a day.  
Before today, I thought that the whole internet was st up like aol.  On aol,
we get our mail from then dirrectly so i do not have to deal with mail
servers.  I still
do not know what they are.  I heard of isp's before but not mail servers.
 also,
I do not know what banwidth means or what it has to do with the internet....
Again,  my only experience with the internet is aol.  Also, I have not even
been on Aol that long.  I was trying to be nice when i sent this and i realy
did not mean to cause anyone any problems.  I  now know that some people do
not have the cancel download button on their isp or their mail server... (is
the mail server the same as isp)
again, i am sorry and i will not send any large file to the rave lists again
....
thank you for your replys and have a nice day...

location:

THE SOUTHSIDE SETTLEMENT HOUSE, a really cool community center we used for
(C): CARBON, and located only a couple blocks away from where last year's
SNOW*FALL was, off of parsons ave. 

directions:

- from the NE take 71 S to to downtown columbus, find the BROAD ST exit and
  go LEFT. 
- from the NW take rt. 23 S to 270 E to 71 S to the BROAD ST exit and go 
  LEFT. 
- from the S take 71 N to downtown columbus, find the BROAD ST exit and 
  go RIGHT. 
- from E or W take 70 to downtown columbus, look for 71 N, then find the 
  BROAD ST exit and go RIGHT. 
- from OSU campus get to I-71, go S towards downtown, and get off at the 
  BROAD ST exit, go LEFT. 

once on broad, go east for two short blocks to PARSONS AVE (look for a KFC
on the corner).  go RIGHT on parsons and follow it south for about 12-13
lights (about 2 miles).  once you see a majestic paint center on the
right, look for a street named WOODROW, approximately 2 blocks later (if
you pass schottensteins and the thrift store you've gone too far).  take
woodrow west for two short blocks to WASHINGTON, go LEFT, and then go
south one more block to a small alley called STANAFORD.  take a RIGHT on
stanaford and you will see plenty of parking, and the space: a large,
grey, concrete, school-looking building with blue doors.  park, look for
the two blue doors under 4 metal pillars, and enter. 

admission is $9 at the door (or $5 with an ID from CCAD).  exact change 
preferred.

weather looks warm and wet (shoulda called it "RAIN*DRIFT" but ah well, 
too late now)

any problems call the table of ele_ments at 614.470.0929.

For technical information on the jp-8000, check out Roland's official
website.  http://www.rolandus.com/ -- for more biased opinions, check the
Analogue Heaven mailing list archives.  I'm not actually on the list, but
if they aren't hollering and screaming about it right now, I'll be...
um... surprised.  :)

Analogue Heaven: http://www.hyperreal.com/music/machines/Analogue-Heaven/

As for how it sounds, check it out yourself.  Don't listen to what anyone
else says about it.  Listen to it and form your own opinion- and make your
decision based on how *you* like it.

Well, considering how I no longer live in Pittsburgh (just moved to
Seattle), I'm going to say my farewells to pb-cle-raves.  Jamie (Trout
Soup) is now your fully empowered list admin, and he's already doing a
fine job.  If any of you ever need a place to stay in Seattle, give me a
ring.  :)

Has anyone set a net meet for this yet ?

The promoter has calls from Canada, Detroit, Chicago, and several
other places not exactly short drives to Erie.  He recently moved
to a larger venue to accomodate the expected 1,500 people with
room for even more.  I haven't seen the space yet, but its reported
to be two airplane hangers.

This is going to be blast !

See you there,

Philip

btw:  I'll be bringing mad candy to pass out.  Maybe even fresh fruit

Yo, ,can you say K-mart??!! The thing is sparkled blue! (a raver special).
And it's poorly built. The knobs are all wobbly, and it just has that
"crap" feel to it. The sounds are "ok", but they just sound......well......
just tooo "Roland".
(and I don't mean the Roland of yesteryear, I'm talking Jd-990/1080 sounding!!
I bought a Nord lead the other day and it's kicks ass!! It rocks the sheet
out of any other Analog/fm Synth avaible. So save a few bucks and get the
best machine...... The Nord baby, the Nord!!!!!!!
peace& respects,
S.

Hugh James Sharpe hath spoken...
*  My first reaction (and Caz can attest to this) was fury.  To think
*  that someone would have such selfish and petty aims as to attempt to
*  thwart a party that we've spent the past four months preparing for
*  with great anticipation just made my blood boil.  But this rage soon
*  turned to faith.  I quickly remembered that our community is too
*  closely knit and too strong to let one lone miscreant spoil this
*  party.  This fake post has only served to strengthen our group and
*  make us relish this party even more.  I know, as I'm sure the rest of
*  you do, that this party will be something for all of us to remember
*  for a long long time.  It will be a night filled with great music and
*  the smiling faces, hugs, and warmth of friends old and new.  It will
*  be a party that we will cherish.

	It's a shame that such unity only comes in relation to some greater
harm.  Why does it need to be spurred by a forged post?  Why is it that 
our unity comes as we all unite in our anger towards someone who may not 
have even done it?

On the eve of the gathering of our tribe, I wanted to share some words from one
of my heroes, Martin Luther King, Jr.  This is something I condensed and
excerpted from one of his sermons, "Pilgrimage to Nonviolence."  Peace.


Agape is disinterested love.  Agape is a love in which the 
individual seeks not his own good, but the good of his neighbor.  
Agape does not begin by discriminating people, or any qualities 
people possess; it begins by loving others for their sakes.  
Agape makes no distinction between friend and enemy; it is 
directed toward both.  Agape springs from the need of the other 
person -- his need for belonging to the best in the human family.

Agape is not weak, passive love; it is love in action.  Agape is
love seeking to preserve and create community.  Agape is insistence
on community even when one seeks to break it.  Agape is a willingness
to sacrifice in the interest of mutuality.  Agape is a willingness
to go to any length to restore community.  Agape is a willingness to
forgive, not seven times, but seventy times seven to restore community.

Agape means a recognition of the fact that all life is interrelated.
All humanity is involved in a single process, and all men are brothers.
To the degree that I harm my brother, *no matter what he is doing to me*,
to that extent I am harming myself.

Love, Agape, is the only cement that can hold this broken community together.

Ok, the hangers seem to be out.  But everything is still moving along nicely :)
Having been at the focal point of rave throwing many times, I must say
Ernest is running everything quite well :)

There is a main room and a chill room.  The Smart Bar will be set up at the
back of the main room.  Let's meet next to the Smart Bar around 1:30 am. I'll
have a large box/tray of candy.

See you there :)

Yeah - sorry kids for the bad info - the "Bubble-Fest" up at Duquesne is
kansilled because of buracracy (the school didn't want to pay for police &
an insurance policy for the event, event though it went over perfectly
well the past 2 years!).  sad. :(  Perhaps I will go find Mr. Yumma after
all.

I think we need a nice logo and put it up on the net... I know that
nw-raves has a logo somewhere that the members just print out, laminate,
and wear to the events (it looks like a backstage pass...)
I'm thinking of doing the design if I have time... any suggestions?

while were talking about gear..has anyone used the bass effects proccessor
called Nightbass (made by ART)....although its obviously good for bass
effects, does anybody know how limiting it is in terms of running higher
end frequencies through it? im thinking about either this, a midiverb, or a
studio quad...and the specs on the nightbass are amazing, just strikes me
as weird that they would want to limit themselves to bass effects only....

also..i use macintosh for sequencing and getting into sampling on it; does
anyone know how i could get any of these for free??:

 deck II, protools, alchemy, vision, unison, digital performer

these are top of the line programs, so im supposing its hard to pirate
them..but its wortha shot, huh?

later

love peter

That's right Phil,

The hangers are out. Sorry for not having any time to post about this
change. I've been extremelly busy at work, on top of all the party
preparation stuff we are going through.

Anyway, the new place is just as good. There is a main floor downstairs,
and a chill room upstairs. There will also be a Smart Bar, and nice
clean bathrooms downstairs.

We have already started moving in the sound equiment, and everything
looks good and ready for tomorrow.

Hopefully many of you are planning on making this trip, and I am looking
forward to seeing you all tomorrow.

BTW, Odyssey is scheduled to play at 1:30 in the mail room (can't
remember on top of my head who will be upstairs at that time).

Just call the infoline later tonight or early tomorrow morning, and the
directions to the map point location will be posted.  

Till tomorrow.

Sign off ;-)

Hi everyone,

In less than 7 hours Mr. Yumma will finally be found. Hopefully, you'll
be the one to find him.

The directions to the party are as follows:

>From points EAST take Interstate 90 West into Pennsylvania and then get
on 79 North.
>From points WEST take Interstate 90 East to Pennsylvania and then get on
79 North.
>From points South take 79 North.

Once you are on 79 North drive to Erie and take East 12th Street exit.
Drive on E 12th for approximately 2 miles, and then turn right on State
Street. The map point location is 1527 State Street. It is a building on
your left hand side at the corner of 16th and State. It has couple of
"CD and Records for Sale" signs hanging in the window. You will be given
a map for the party location along with a bracelet. The party is $10
payable at the map point location.

Most of the DJ's have already arrived, and everything is looking fine.

The doors open at 8 PM, and the party starts promptly at 9.

See you all there.

<<<DISCLAIMER>>> this is a _WAY_ long review <<<DISCLAIMER>>>

this is my review of snow*drift + individually twisted, also the story
of the adventure also known as...this weekend. 

CHAPTER 1: *   *  * *snow*drift* *  *   *    after gathering together 
the cru for this trip: elias, dj buff, trout soup, wanda, and vanita, 
we departed from kent at like 10:30 & drove way fast to columbus & 
finally arrived at the party around 12:30, but hey...we're 
FASHIONABLY late!

the space was <<tha bomb>> cause it's got a big wood dancefloor, has
all kinds of quirky little rooms + hallways, is clean, has a kitchen, 
has decent bathrooms, has a courtyard with curvy staircases. 

at first i didn't have a chance to pay much attention to the music 
since i was seeing so many people i knew (columbus is like a huge 
family--i love that city =D ) but i saw gaga for a short time. very 
interesting =], neato lites =], no explosions this time =[. but 
REALLY had to dance so i went downstairs danced a little, handed out 
some party favors, they were cut out paper snowflakes (didja guess?) 
that i made. 

then phantom 45 came on--wow wow wow! this was the 1st time i saw 
him. he was really tearing it up. it seemed there were a few 
problems with the needle skipping on the record though, maybe due to 
wobbly tables the turntables were on. he played a remix of "danger" by
blahzay blahzay (did i spell that right?) which i had never heard 
before. i must say i like those jungle remixes of hip-hop records. but
i'm terrible about reviewing dj sets since my memory is bad + i only 
know some technical terms. so i'm writing what i remember about these 
sets. 

next billeebob was on (or was there someone in between?), spinning 
techno/detroit--wow wow wow again! tons of showboating + as far as i 
could tell all of it was on (once i saw him when it was a little off 
some of the time) & he worked it really well into the set. some djs 
get carried away + kill switch out 1/2 the track or scratch/sample/etc
too long then don't have time to make a proper mix, but he didn't do 
that at all, it worked nicely with the records. once somehow the
needle skipped bigtime maybe also from wobbly tables, but he had a
good recovery. but i missed seeing paris (or as the flyer says "paris 
mack" woo woo) spin. he was another dj i had wanted to see. did he 
tear shit up too? 

later i think i played old school video games a bit :] then i met
becky for the 1st time =] & we started organizing breakfast around 
4:30. she introduced me to mouse who also i met for the 1st time =],
who is also known as dj shira khan. becky told me how mouse had needed
a mouse-related record so she gave her a mickey mousketeer record, 
which mouse played at the beginning of her set which was that dark 
kind of jungle in between intelligent & hardstep, which i don't know 
the name of. i have an idea for that record, mouse: you could scratch
& sample with it, i think you could get pretty cool effects with it. 
becky & i had to leave during the set (sorry) because we had to do the
shopping for the extra things needed for breakfast so we went to 24hr-
kroger. somebody on mw-raves said something about going pimping thru 
the mall of america which i thought was so funny + so true--i pimp 
everywhere, especially the mall. so we went pimping thru kroger. 

then back to the party to start breakfast, along with so many other 
netpeople. i can't begin to remember all the names. there were
pancakes, coffee, juice, fruit, donuts, etc. thanks to everyone who
brought such good food. we started a collection of spare change to 
reimburse us (ed, becky, me) partially for the cost of food from 
kroger. thanks to everybody who contributed. there was still tons of
food so i went out to the dancefloor & told lots of people to come
eat & i gave away all 10 of my kiwifruits to people out there. 
breakfast was quite a success.

CHAPTER 2: )   )  ) )doug's house( (  (   ( doug, who is a way cool 
guy, let our posse sleep in his living room, along with jennifer &
jeff from the untranslateable booth, from whom i had bought a shirt 
earlier. when we woke up, doug suggested making omlettes. after
several of us had secured some necessary supplies doug made his famous 
secret recipe omlettes for everyone. they are so good + include plenty
of yummmy CHEESE (for you wisconsin people =] ). thanks so much doug 
for all of this. 

in the evening i made a quick trip north with wanda + vanita, stopping
at used kids' records where i picked up...the pink panther theme
song. yay! it is pimping style all the way. i'm going to try mixing & 
sampling it with hip-hop + maybe jungle. then at world records i got 3
records: 1 sorta electro, 1 techno/detroit, + 1 hardstep jungle. there
were only _2_ hardstep records (but about 50 intelligent) in the
entire store (which is fairly big) (and no happy hardcore but i never 
see that anywhere anyway :[ ). what is up with that? i'll do my best
to review the records after i've gotten a chance to listen to them.

CHAPTER 3: <   <  < <individually twisted> >  >   >    we arrived
around 12:00, parked the van + i locked the doors but the keys were
still in the ignition. this was a very expensive mistake i made. i 
had checked my pocket like always for 2 sets of keys + it felt like 2 
but was only 1. i need to have them in seperate pockets from now on. 
one of the people directing traffic told me they could look for a slim
jim & come back out later to check with them. the space was a warehouse
which was really dirty, as in thick black grime on every surface, in 
the air, & subsequently my lungs. it was also very cold & very dark. 
but besides the cold & grime, i like warehouses. there were no 
bathrooms, just porta-potties that got nasty pretty fast. it especially 
sucks not being able to see a thing in them. the price was $18, which
seemed a little steep, i was anticipating something more like $12-$15, 
considering it was dayton + there were something like 7 or 8 djs/acts. 
a good point was the lasers (by lovelight), + the sound system sounded
good to me + plenty loud, but jamie said there was turntable feedback,
which i hadn't noticed.

all the music in the party was techno/detroit/hard acid/hardcore. i
heard several good tracks i recognized but none of the djing really
stood out, and no showboating, as far as i know =[. todd sines went 
on & did his live pa. i liked that a lot but i know much much less 
about live pas than djing so i can't comment really. then neil 
landstrum was supposed to do a live pa but spun instead. does
anybody know the reason behind this?

then i was checking on the van, + ended up talking to someone he
introduced himself as kimyon. he was the promoter, he told me they had
expected twice as many people for the party & were losing tons of
money. could you fit twice as many people in that building? i don't
know. but i don't think he was lying, i think he WAS probably losing
lots of money, which definitely sucks.

the van, which is a dodge caravan, has locks on it built for a tank. i
don't suggest trying to break into one. jamie tried a thousand
different things to try to get into it, the most ingenious of which
was trying to open a window by prying open the latch with a coat
hanger then sticking a metal rod thru the window + to the other end to
hook the keys & pull them out. i went to ask chris if his insurance
covered vandalism, he said no. then i went back outside + suddenly the
keys go flying across the parking lot. i picked them up & jamie said
he broke the window. he had been trying to break the bolt on it
instead. so as we scraped chunks of glass out of the van, we realized
that the renegades flyers would cover up the hole. in case you haven't
seen them yet, they are about 14"x36", yeah about 3 ft wide. jamie + i
agreed that we thought evolution/maxximum was about having the most
badass sound system anywhere (!!!=]!!!), a quality light show, &
bringing in good djs (honorable goals), but not about flashy show + 
poster size flyers (not necessarily honorable goals i guess). i do
like the flyers but is the size of them really imperative?

at about 6 we got ready to leave + i went to find jennifer + jeff
because i was hangin out with them & had left my stuff in their 
suitcase so it wouldn't get dirty but they had already left for 
kentucky. jj are you on mw-raves? they are selling shirts & tapes for
you. could you please contact them as soon as you can & ask them to 
mail me my backpack with contents (+ hopefully my flyers + massive 
magazines with it)? there are really really important things in my 
backpack. tell them i need it as soon as they could possibly mail it +
i can send $ to cover postage once i get it & that i said thank you.
thanks jj.

after we left we bought tape + taped 3 flyers together + covered the
hole of the window. the van was a big advertisement for renegades!
then we drove back to kent, i think i had the accelerator floored 90%
of the time both there + back (i'm a very tense person. those that 
know me probably know this), because we were in a big hurry + i like
to drive fast anyway. i think i pulled my calf muscle or something. we
finally made it into kent at about 11 am. now i feel like going home &
sleeping for a week.

this true bizarre insane rave adventure brought to you by the letters
a, e, & k, & the numbers 909 & 303

You can think of the flyer as an experiment in form and function.  Also
there is a bookmark sized flyer as well.  Regardless of flyer size you can
expect our usual high standards in production for renegades.  Three rooms,
kickass sound, great lights (eyegasm in the house), and incredible djs
(including the just added Adam X).

        Aight here it is, my review of Mr. Yumma. We got out to Erie around
12:45, went to the map point, got our braclets, and jetted up da street to
the party. There wasn't to much parking left at this time and we ended up
about 3 blocks away from the building, but it was all good.  The main door
led into the chill room where they were selling all kinds of goodies and
such. There was a short hallway that led to the staircase and thru another
door into the main room. If you had to walk thru this part of the building
at all during the night then you know it needed to be about five feet wider!
At one point I was coming up from the bathroom and got stuck in the
staircase for about a good twenty minutes. And the bathroom lines were crazy
also. There was like a room that had two bathrooms in it and you would think
there would be like two lines right? Well there was about four lines, go
figure? Well the main room was pretty phat. You walked in and there was like
a little area around the smart bar and the dance floor was on the other side
of a few dividers. During the peak hours this room was packed full to the
fucking brim! I had to fight to get a peice of dancefloor. The upstairs room
was about as big as the chill room, I only made it up there one time due to
the number of kids in the staircase. I was by the smart bar from like 1:30
till 2:00 and I didn't see anybody that looked like they was waiting for
anybody, and the people that were around there that I did ask had no idea
what the pb-cle mailing list was. Where was everybody? I spent most of my
time downstairs near or on the dancefloor. And just as the place started to
clear out and you could actually dance the cops came in and had to fuck up
our groove yet once again!!!!!!  I did not hear any official reason why the
party got busted, but I would imagine it was because of noise. I want to
leave you with a comment I heard last night while I was waiting for my ride
after the party got busted. - Are you ready for a revolution? -

:) thanks for the review greta;

id have to agree that it IS hard to find happy hardcore rekkids anywhere;
people say i should make some HH tracks; and ive been tryin...from what ive
noticed with my little exposure to HH is that most songs have little cheesy
vocal tracks that totally make the song cool and recognizable, or little
samples that are way cool and overused :P
        im not into vocals at the moment, and what i love about HH is the
harmonic melodies that swirl over the fast distorted baselines and fast
chord changes..mmmm yummy :9  back once again. i love it.

also,
i sat down at a piano awhile back and figured out the pink panther theme
song, and i thought it would sound great with a hip hop/jungle remix.. so
ive decided that im gonna finish the pink panther remix ive been working on
to the electronica tape, for yall to laugh at and maybe even appreciate
(its 100% synthesized not sampled, so the breaks might not be what yalll r
used to;)
but everyone loves that theme...sort of lounge cat pimp song it is yes..

i have to stop talking about what im gonna do and just do it..just wanted
to let you know that i dont think im the first to try to remix the pink
panther theme; but im motivated by the challenge that awaits me in the
lab...the *essXlab* i like to call it (Energize Synthesize Synchronize; X
Limits And Boundaries) god i love akronyms..

rock on greta, good luck with your mix; hope u like mine =D

ps>> jimg/skoop:: is it alright if i submit my tracks over my spring break?
(March 8-16th) ill be in pittsburgh for about 4-5 of these days, and will
probably need that much time to do what i want to do, now that ive changed
my approach.

i thought renegades were supposed to be like free parties or something..no
hype/underground...conflicting definitions i guess. ive only been to jive
turkeyz style renegades, and the flyers were always tiny and blank n white,
even when rick had deadly buda and skinner come spin again. the true
advertisement came from word of mouth, and the flyer was there so u didnt
have to write down the infoline so u could GET there.

hmmmm.......i also was there around 1:30-2:00....i didn't find anyone
either(i was the short asian blonde girl wearing a sweater vest and long
sleeved shirt incase anyone remembers)...perhaps we should have a sign
or something.  i'm too shy to just go up and talk to someone...but i
basically spent the whole night in this part of the main room because of
every once in awhile someone would go in and out of the door and it
would cool the place off.  anyways, i was just wondering if anyone had
any weird experiences with these four drunk(?)guys wearing flannel
shirts?  i was just doing my liquid thang and these four guys approach
me asking me, "what the fuck are you doing?!?!"  and they asked me to
stop dancing.  i just turned around and ignored them and they left. than
a few hours later, two of them were sitting against the wall and when my
friend walked by them they grabbed her leg or something like that.  we
moved to the other side of the little room...i noticed that they were
grabbing other girls legs...and than some guy was dancing and i guess he
accidently stepped on one of flannel guys shirts and the guy exploded.
he was yelling something like he wanted an apology or something and than
my friend was wearing this gray hooded sweatshirt with the hood up and
while he was dancing(by the way he's an awesome dancer) the guys were
yelling, "go rocky, go rocky, go rocky" till he stopped dancing.  they
left after that and a few minutes later they walked by and one of them
kicked me!!!!! that whole incident kinda put a dent in my night.  plus i
dont know if it's just erie but i also received a lot of attitude and
bad looks for people especially from candy ravers and those kids wearing
the contempo style clothing(some really tall girl with curly hair
elbowed(checked) me really hard and she didn't even aplogize) alls i was
doing was dancing. i don't think i did anything wrong...i wasn't being
offensive i hope...perhaps if i sucked on a pacifer and wore skin tight
crop tops and showed the top of my underware i wouldn't get so many
looks.  i don't know.  sorry i don't mean to sound like i'm generalizing
here but i was amazed at the negative vibe i was receiving.  

anyways, osheen was awesome as usual.  the lighting was good.  by the
way, the space was way too small.  i though the party was going to be at
a airplane hanger or something?  oh, the bathroom was gross too. there
was piss all over the toliet seats and they were clogged up i think 
there was also too many people cracked out on drugs just standing there
taking precious dancing space. 

well, i think that's all i have to say...sorry my review is so sporadic


oh, so does anyone know why the cops came?  and did anyone go to the
afterparty?  my friends and i called the infor like an hour later and
there was no info on it.

so is anyone going to mystic this weekend here in pittsburgh?  maybe we
can try this net meet stuff again if a lot of people from the
cleveland/pittsburgh area attend.  this time we can have nametags or
something ;P


peace,
amy

okay,

three questions:

Why did Neil Landstrumm *not* perform live as stated on the flyer?


Why were people charged $18 when the voice mail said $17?


What happened to the alleged "surprise headliner" that the voice mail spoke of?



aside from these *very* upsetting problems, here's my view of the very cold
evening....


Todd sines was on when i got there...rockin it as usual.  i'm not really
going too in depth with him.  most of you know what he sounds like anyway.

next up was neil landstrumm, who spun for 2 hours.  he has very good
beatmatching skills, but still not even comparable to a true performance.
he played a whole lot of his tracks, which i guess was enjoyable to a
certain extent, but not even *close* to what a live pa could have been.  

let me try to explain this further:  it's thanksgiving.  you are awaiting
your turkey dinner.  everyone expects a homemade turkey dinner from mom.
the whole family is there at the table and excited about the meal.  you wait
and then in comes mom with an entire turkey dinner made by someone else from
Boston Market.  how do *you* feel?  am i saying that Neil Landstrumm is, in
fact, my mother?  perhaps, but i think you have figured out my point by now...

but enough about that...

next up was carlos terra.  he was good.  straight up pumpin techno. also
spun for two hours.

my highlight of the night was Alexi Delano.  i had no idea who this person
was beforehand, so i didn't really know what to expect.  what i got was a
very cerebral two hour set, filled with complex twisted percussion and
subtle textures.  looooong smooth mixes.  tiny eq adjustments making all the
difference.  this man was *very* focused.  he knew exactly what he was
doing, and you could tell that he already knew where he was going 5 minutes
before it happened.  i enjoyed his set as a whole more than anyone else's
that night by far.

anyhow, it was COLD.  one heater for a large warehouse space which wasn't
even turned on all of the time was of very little help (and i had three
layers of clothing on and very thick socks).  not to mention that door that
they had to open in order to get all of todd sines' equipment out which let
what little heat there was out of the building anyway.  i don't blame them
though, i mean the door had to be used.  this only added to my frustrations
however.

a smaller turnout than last month's party.  personally, if i had driven
myself i would have asked for my money back and left as soon as i found out
Landstrumm was not performing.  not to take anything away from the rest of
the lineup, but i was there to see Neil Landstrumm *perform.*  whatever
happened was most likely beyond the promoters control, but it nonetheless
made me unenthusiastic about the rest of the evening.


anyway, i'd just like to close in saying this is not an attack on Justus.
up until now, i have always had a *great* time at their events.  i plan to
go to their next party regardless because of it's  killer lineup, but all i
would like is a brief explanation from someone closely associated with the
event if possible.

this topic has popped up from time to time.  mw-raves used to have pink
mw-rave-badges that you could spot a mile away.  anyhooo, why not just
pirate the pb-cle-raves logo from the pb-cle www page?  add a nice
background in a _LOUD_
color for everyone to see and get it color copied???  i dont know where to
get _quality_ laminations done (as in thick plastic), but i know of a few
places to get crappy ones done (as in thin plastic).  just an idea.

Yeah, I think this is a great idea.  If the graphic is created, could we 
put a copy of it on the PB-CLE archive so that people with color printers 
could just print it out?  I have a place at school that makes laminates, 
and I'm sure most schools have someplace on campus that can do the same.  
Also, most computer labs will have a color printer somewhere, so ... 
who's gonna design the badge?

you should have kicked those kids in the flannels back, they wouldn't
start shit if they got what they deserved. 
	i went to erie to promote for get down, but decided not to stick
out through the crappy music and packed in crowds until 4:00 to wait for
osheen. he is sooo good, and he's a really cool guy too, so i wanted to
stay, but 4:00 was a little too long to stay there. we left at midnight. i
agree that the attitude was a bit much, actually more than a bit. that
also influenced my leaving.
	about mystic, everyone should go. wait until you hear the music
that comes out of there. if you like osheen, then you will love the djs
there. i'm so excited!!!

I don't know how widely-known this is (I just found out about it), 
but there's a good IDM/ambient/electronica radio show 
on WRCT Fridays at midnite, which carries on the old .electronica torch.
it's called "cloud.interference", hosted by michele and joshua.
very enjoyable...highly recommended.

uhh, jim, we're starting on sunday the 2nd, right? i know it's sundays at
10. i forget. well, at any rate, that's when we're doing it; i think
that's when we're starting. more concrete info to follow by the end of the
week. i'm working on flyers, too, so...yep. we'll give y'alls more
concrete info.
but just so y'alls know, we're not officially djing, as we've decided to
center this night more around the song than the beat. so expect to hear
next to nothing in the way of beatmatching--there will be edits and
segues, though. beatmatching just doesn't suit the genre.

Oi yeah! - too much happy hardcore thesedays is tooo cheesy and
formulamatic.  A few years back there were more creatuve break patterns
and sample use and less ultra-cheezy vocal samps.  

Stateside kids should get into producing HHC - that would totally rock!
There's still good UK stuff coming out, but I think they're starting into
a bad (less creative) trend.  Do it pete - I'd love to hear it!  I know
D-cypol and 187 have worked on some tracks, but I'v never heard of any
other US hhc. 

On finding records: there's a couple on line places for ordering
Happy Hardcore (they do phone orders too) - do a netsearch for Nokturnal
Records or Indepth Records - both are fairly good at getting new tunes,
but it'll cost you.  Nokturnal is more established & had better selection,
in Indepth is just starting - so look out.

Actually, there is a jungle tune where the bassline plays the pink-panther
theme...only heard it once - was a cool idea, but not brilliant in
execution.

I have to say, Yumma was rockin... would have appreciated more space...
but the vibe was really good and we caught the sunrise coming back into
pittsburgh... (nothing like a good sunrise to really make a party...)

Yeah, what was up with that? Maybe a better question was why the people

Hopefully so... I'm going to see if I can get some sort of pb-cle pass
made up... I've got a preliminary design for one side of the badge and
I'm going to make the other side bright with the pb-cle logo (ala the
pope's suggestion)... 
oh, how do I get the finished design up on the pb-cle site?

In the name of all of us here at Liquid Sound Distortion I would like to
thank everyone that attended The Search for Mr. YUMMA on Saturday.

The response and the attendance at the party was more that overwhelming.
Considering that there were parties in DAYTON, BUFFALO, ROCHESTER and
TORONTO on the same night, none of us expected the number of people that
actually made the trip to Erie (1521 sold tickets). I definitely agree
that the space needed to be larger. But once again, there was no way for
us to predict the actual attendance numbers. 

The vibe though, was one of the best that I have ever experienced over
the last 11 years that I've been going to parties, both in Europe and in
North America. Everyone was just great. A big hug to all of you.
 
The reason that the party was stopped at 6 am was the noise. There is an
old retirement home across the street from the venue, and people from
there had called complaining about the noise coming from the windows on
the second floor. We tried to fix the problem by placing people there
monitoring the windows, but due to the large crowd, I understand the
need to have them open from time to time. In conversation with the
police sergeant and several officers I was assured that there were no
other problems whatsoever that led to termination of the event.
Actually, "this is quite nice gathering of young people dancing and
smiling. I wish I were 15 years younger" and "this is a great place for
underage people to have fun" were comments that came form two of the
officers. They also were very sorry that they had to do stop the party,
but due to the noise ordinance they had to follow the rules. 

Even though the party was stopped at 6, the only DJ's that were not
heard from the original line up were Rob Morley and Geek. We will make
sure to accommodate them to play at a future event of ours.   

I agree that the sound quality could have been better down stairs. The
level was high, but not too clear, especially close to the speakers.

The after-party. In the whole process of talking to the cops and
receiving a noise violation citation, two of us were on our way to set
up the after-party location. We weren't even 10 blocks away when all of
a sudden our driver Joe (an LSD member) went into convulsion and we hit
a pole on the side of the street. The blood and urine samples were
negative (no alcohol or drugs found). The paramedics took more than 1/2
hour to actually wake him up. He had been up for more that 3 days, and
just collapsed from exhaustion. The police situation, coupled with this
problem made it impossible for us to actually stage the planned
after-party. We deeply apologize for that, and especially for not
letting it be known on the infoline. I believe that in the confusion
(this may actually be too strong of a word) of it all no one changed the
infoline (Joe being the person that usually maintains it was in no shape
or form able to do that, and Ernest was in the police car for a while
too).  

I'm sorry if couple of you had any bad experiences at the party.
Overall, I received high praises and extremely positive comments about
the whole experience from huge amount of people - promoters, the DJ's,
ravers from far away places (i.e. Philadelphia, D.C., Toronto,
Baltimore, Detroit to name but a few). It seems like an overwhelming
majority loved and enjoyed the party and were looking forward to coming
in Erie again soon. Once again we would like to extend our thanks to
everione who was there to support us and enjoy the party. We ho[pe that
all of you will join us again soon, and we prmose that all the small
details that were not perfect this time around will be improved and
fixed at hour next event.

>why aren't there more all ages (or 18+) club nights in pgh?

Because pgh clubs (mostly) suck, and they make the bulk of their profit on beer sales.  :-)

(It's not a club, but) We decided to hold the sit'n'spin event at a coffeeshop precisely because it would inherently be all ages.

Overall I had a great time at the Party.  I don't mind some crowding
and generally expect some.  I passed out about 8 lbs of candy.  I hope
most of you got some :)  I thought the crazy evening was in many
respects a classic rave, hassles and all.

I was held up by some unfortunate minor drama til just after 2 am.  I
stopped by but didn't see anyone obviously waiting and couldn't remember
any specific personal descriptions at the time.  I think a pb-cle badge
is a great idea.

When you get harrased by anyone at a party please point out the people
to anyone with a laminant or guarding a door.  They should be able to
take care of the problem by telling the jerks to chill or ejecting
them from the event, whichever is called for by their actions.  Given
the wild nature of raves, security doesn't have a hope of seeing
everything.  We must make some effort to help police the event ourselves
to keep it fun for everyone.  Had I known of the problem, you can be
be certain that the individuals would have been ejected & wristbands
removed.

Interesting.  Several of my friends and I remarked that it was really
friendly crowd overall.  The crowded section around the doorway/stairwell
was an exception at times when people felt too pressed in upon.
was a notable except

It was supposed to be in a hangar.  I'm precisely sure why it was
moved.  Perhaps Viktor can answer that for us.

>was piss all over the toliet seats and they were clogged up i think

The bathrooms were certainly not satisfactory.  Unfortunately, many
promoters do not take such into serious consideration when considering
locations.  Given the promoter's crowd estimate of 1500, they should
have rented at least 2 and probably 3 porta-johns.  I usually roughly
1 stall per 300 people expected.  According to the promoter they
actually had some 1600 in attendence making it tighter still.

According to some of the cops, the only reason it was shut down were
noise complaints.  Given the apparent business district location of
the venue, I didn't expect any such problems and I'm sure the promoters
didn't either.  I didn't notice any residential housing nearby when
I arrived but there must have been some.  Overall the cops behavior upon
shutting the event down seemed quite relaxed.  I didn't see or hear of
anyone being harrassed with the exception of Ernest whom they kept in
the squad car for what seemed like hours.  I saw them writing out at
least one citation, so he was certainly fined.  In my experience, such
fines are generally in the hundreds of dollars.

I'll contact Ted to find out about the layout of the space.  If we could
get the badge design uploaded somewhere, I'll see about getting some
badges or perhaps simply stickers produced. I would make them available
at one of the vendor stands, or should none be available the flyer table.

i always thought renegade parties were suppse to be at a location in
which the owners have no knowledge of whats going on.  ex. old
warehouses(generator power) or any abandened building that is hidden
away from sight so if 500+ ppl show up all of the sudden the po-po won't
know.

just thoughts

    I agree there should be more 18+ nights/clubs.  I'm 21 now so I
don't have to worry, but many of my friends are underage still and this
makes things difficult.  
    On the 15th of March I'm spinning at Laga in Oakland and it's going
to be, I think, either 18+ or anyone with a college ID.  Maybee more of
these nights of different music at clubs can be arranged to get a wide
age range of club goers and ravers.  

later,
Johnny

phattest under $10 event I've ever been to! :) My friend and I made the 2
hour trek from Marietta to Columbus and arrived at the party about 11:30
or so. The space was completely cool and really trippy/gothic looking with
all of these weird little siderooms/stairs going all over the place, I
felt like I was in a funhouse sometimes, it was really wild :)  there were
these old tvs all over that had pieces of plastic over the screen with
snowflakes cut out that cast a really spooky glow over the hallways, it
just made a really neat atmosphere. the oldschool videogames were
halarious, i didn't get a chance to play any but it reminded me of my old
Commodore PET and my TRS-80 hehe.
	After scoping out everything we went out to the main room. The
dancefloor was really nice, like a waxed wood gym floor, perfect for all
the breakdancers! We got down there just in time to see Kingsize a couple
of minutes into his set and he totally rocked! (Now i know why hes called
Kingsize, hes pretty short) He really got me groovin and spun some killer
drum&bass. Next up I was expecting Billeebob (i think he was in between
Kingsize and Phantom 45 on the program) but instead Phantom 45 came out
and TOTALLY TORE SHIT UP. He busted out some killer oldschool scratching
and spun a wicked set of hardstep jungle. He was by far the highlight of
my night, he really got the crowd moving and the whistles were in full
effect! :) I have missed a couple of chances to see him before and he
really fucking ruled, all of the energy of his mixtape plus more!
	But what really sucks is that I was so into Phantom's set that I
completely lost track of time and missed the netmeet in the kitchen area
at 2am, sorry guys!! :( I was really looking forward to meeting some of
the peeps that I've been talking to on the list/VRave :( Also I'm sorry
Becky for not bringing my assigned breakfast item (some fruit) because I
didn't get your email until I was back home...ugh.
	Well after Phantom's set the vibe wasn't as huge, a lot of people
were just sitting around on those big steps up against the wall watching
everyone else dance, I wish more people would have been moving, but it was
cool anyways!
	After continuing to groove my ass off to Billeebobs phat detriot
set and Paris' really killer intelligent/dark jungle set, my friend was
starting to get really fucked up. He was pretty much dehydrated/overheated
and was having really painful stomach cramps and the chills, so we ended
up leaving around 5:15, which again sucks because I missed the
netbreakfast, which I was really looking forward to, UGH! We were planning
on crashing with a friend of mine at OSU in the morning, hitting all the
nice rekkid stores on High Street the next afternoon and taking off for
Individually Twisted in Dayton that night. Instead he wanted to go home,
he drank a huge bottle of SunnyD and pretty much passed out in the back of
my jeep from exhaustion. So the next day I really didn't feel like driving
ANOTHER 3.5 hours to get to Dayton from Marietta when we should have just
been making the 1 hour trip from Columbus to Dayton, not to mention I
didn't have anyone else to go with me, so I didn't get to make it to
Dayton :( Sorry for not getting to met anyone from the list, next time I
will I promise hehe :) Oh, for most of the night I was grooving up close
to the DJ stand, had on phat green pants, a silver shirt and a blue
beanie. 
	A huge thanks to ed/ele_mentals for throwing a truly phat party
with a huge vibe at a fair price that wasn't busted, pretty much the
perfect party! I should be at Return of Superfly this sat, so if there is
a netmeet I will see ya there! laterz..

Def....I slowly approach 21...but even when I'm over, I'll want to party
with my under 21 friends.  It sucks that its all about alcohol.
Anyone know the lowdown on 168?  I haven't been there since last fall,
mostly because I went to Steel City one night and there was literally *5*
people there.  LAGA seems to be going in the right direction, and the
space/setup is good (though the sound could be better).

Yes - definately.  Do you know if the club owner is willing to try
different things?  I think something like a hip-hop/jungle night would do
be able to do well.   The reason I mention the mix is that I'm thinking a
100% drum & bass night wouldn't be able to survive on its own for long  -
though I'd love to see it - unless promoted heavily.   I'v noticed the
times I'v gone on their 'techno' night they never play jungle - only house
& slowbreaks, with a few surprises the one D-Cypol night and I think some
trance dj.

Just thoughts.  I'd definitly help promote a jungle night if we could hook
one up there.

l8s all,

Ok, the DJ will be near where one enters the main room and the water vendor
will be in the back.  How about the net meet being at 2:00 am to the left
of the water vendor (as one faces his table).  If the badge design is posted
I will make 20 laminated copies, wear one, and given them out to anyone who
asks for one.

Peace,

howdy!!  i was at mr. yumma and it was a kool party..lotz of ppl!!!  i did
notice a negative vibe though, oh well!!!  that was a minor part!!  but i
think it went off pretty good!!  yeah!!  i was afraid it would get busted
like THE FIRST did in akron...but at least they let us party til 6 am!!
but i have a question....did anybody notice the cops searching the place
like krazy???  i think they were hoping to find any kind of drug and/or
paraphnelia (sp?)!!!  they had their falshlights out searching the floor and
every corner they could find!!!  that damn 20/20 program!!!!!  errrggghhh!!!

i was just wondering if anybody else noticed the cops acting like bloodhounds?
i think they were just hoping to bust the place having drugs, but they were
very "friendly" and calm about getting us out!!!  at least they didn't come in
screaming, and yelling.......one good point!!!

well, despite the fact the party got busted i will definetely come to another
erie party...it was phat!!!!!

while the police came in i continued to dance and so did my one friend...
the cops stopped and smiled at us and continued to search the other room.
alls i can say is that they emitted a greater vibe than some of the so
called ravers who actually attended.



by the way, i forgot to give mad props to john(dj kurova) thanks for
driving...and hey since you only stalled twice i'll let you drive me to
the next erie or cleveland party ;P
miquel...thanks for the positive vibe
melissa-thanks for all the water, your company and watching my back ;) 
jessica-again thanks for the water
nick and sasha(okay they didn't come but i've got to give mad props to
my cmu boys)
and to adam who didn't come...it wasn't the same without you :(


see ya at the next party,
amy


p.s. by the way, did anyone find mr. yumma?  me thinks he was the one
with the big pants, big smile, giving off a postive vibe and dancing his
ass off.

Kids - OH MY GOSH! heres the line-up for BASSRUSH IV ...its completely
manic!  I'v heard this is tentative (rumored that Hype & Zinc aren't
confirmed)...but I wouldn't doubt the BASSRUSH crew could get them...plus
2, yes 2 happy-hardcore djs and CLARKEE! He can cook you with his sounds!

I'm, not sure what my situation will be by then (I think I'm out of
school, but probably will be steady workin')...but is there any thought of
bus-trippin out there?  More thoughts when the date gets closer.

Actually, I did see them kinda searchin around a bit, I saw one of them
pick up a pipe off the ground, look at it, and just tossed it back and
radio'd the other cops saying "Wow, it's really packed with people in
here" or something to that effect.. I talked to a couple of them and they
all told me it was because of a noise violation, an old folks home across
the street, and nothing to do with drugs or 20/20 or anything else..I
think they even made some positive comments.. :)

Never heard of a.v.e productions but I would say beware of any party in
which the promoter mispells the title.
Unless it was done intentionally.

Chris,

You are totally right. 20/20 had nothing to do with the premature end of
the party. And concerning what the cops found during their search, I was
"presented" with 1 really small pipe and a plastic bag with couple of
hits of acid. They said that considering the amount of people there,
that was nothing to wory about at all. It wasn't stated in the noise
citation, or reported anywhere else. 

So, it all went fine.
And as i had already mentioned before, they had several positive
comments as well. 

Regards,

Viktor

i noticed the drunken flanneled guys, too.  i guess everyone form the  
list missed each other.  the badge idea would solve that problem, i  
think.  the deal with mr.yumma and the assholes is that it got way  
too publicized.  i've heard about it from people not usually into the  
rave scene, and mystic is the same way.  someone told me it's posted  
in their gym locker room!!!  i'll probably go anyhow, but there are  
gonna be ALOT of people there, from what i hear, so we'll have all  
types.

	horizen is looking to be a really cool party. i don't know if
anyone knows who rock raida is, but he is really good. and as far as
a.v.e.productions go, they are some local kids that are so far doing a
great job to bring some cool parties back to pgh. if you are on the
sunshine kids mailing list, then you have probably recieved a pre-flyer,
although i may add that we ran out while stuffing the envelopes, so don't
worry if you didn't get one, i'm sure the real flyer will be out soon.

hi all

i have an odd statement/plea i need to make- this may not be the right
forum, but i don't know what else to do.

disclaimer- all of this info was given to me by someone, i don't know it
firsthand--

a friend of mine is really scared and asked me if there was anything i
could do, to put the word out or something..
her sister is dating Soji-Fu, and within the last couple of days he
threatened to have her shot (after pushing her to the ground). apparently
he treats her like this often, but this time he said he had to "take care
of it"  and mentioned getting someone to shoot her. i *wasn't* there and
so it's all from someone else's mouth, so don't start flaming me- i'm
doing a scared friend a favor. if anyone knows him could you *please* try
and talk some sense into him or something? -at least before this ends in a
nasty way...

thanks for listening
me

>> Deep Thoughts (by Jack Handey)
>> 
>> 
>> If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let'em go,
>> because, man, they're gone.
>> ==========
>> If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them
>> down?  We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason."
>> ==========
>> To me, it's a good idea to always carry two sacks of something when
>> you walk around.  That way, if anybody says, "Hey, can you give me a
>> hand?"  You can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."
>> ==========
>> One thing kids like is to be tricked.  For instance, I was going
>> to take my nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old
>> burned-out warehouse. "Oh no," I said, "Disneyland burned down."
>> 
>> He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a
>> pretty good joke.  I started to drive over to the real Disneyland,
>> but it was getting pretty late.
>> ==========
>> The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of the
>> face.
>> ==========
>> If you lived in the Dark Ages and you were a catapult operator, I bet
>> the most common question people would ask is, "Can't you make it shoot
>> farther?"  "No, I'm sorry.  That's as far as it shoots."
>> ==========
>> Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful flamingo,
>> flying across in front of a beautiful sunset?  And he's carrying a
>> beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful
>> painting with his feet.  And also, you're drunk.
>> ==========
>> I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our
>> children's children, because I don't think children should be having sex.
>> ==========
>> If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him
>> is, "God is crying."  And if he asks why God is crying, another cute
>> thing to tell him is, "Probably because of something you did."
>> ==========
>> If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the mirror,
>> because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic.
>> ==========
>> Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first
>> instinct is to laugh.  But then I think, what if I was an ant and she
>> fell on me.  Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.
>> ==========
>> To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography
>> and the dancers hit each other.
>> ==========
>> I hope if dogs ever take over the world and they choose a king, they
>> don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with
>> some good ideas.
>> ==========
>> If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the lemons
>> (maybe by shoving them down his throat).
>> ==========
>> Instead of having "answers" on a math test, they should just call them
>> "impressions," and if you got a different "impression," so what, can't
>> we all be brothers?
>> ==========
>> Probably the earliest fly swatters were nothing more than some sort of
>> striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.
>> ==========
>> I wish I would have a real tragic love affair and get so bummed out
>> that I'd just quit my job and become a bum for a few years, because
>> I was thinking about doing that anyway.
>> ==========
>> I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate revolver.
>> And since he's so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him real quick
>> and hand it to him.
>> ==========
>> Maybe in order to understand mankind we have to look at that word
>> itself.  MANKIND.  Basically, it's made up of two separate words
>> "mank" and "ind."
>> 
>> What do these words mean?  It's a mystery and that's why so is mankind.
>> ==========
>> If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else flying
>> forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact.
>> ==========
>> It's easy to sit there and say you'd like to have more money.  And I
>> guess that's what I like about it.  It's easy.  Just sitting there,
>> rocking back and forth, wanting that money.
>> ==========
>> If you ever reach total enlightenment while you're drinking a beer, I bet
>> it makes beer shoot out your nose.
>> ==========
>> To me, clowns aren't funny.  In fact, they're kinda scary.  I've wondered
>> where this started and I think it goes back to the time I went to the
>circus
>> and a clown killed my dad.
>> ==========
>> As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red again,
>> I sat there thinking about life.  Was it nothing more than a bunch of
>> honking and yelling?  Sometimes it seemed that way.
>> ==========
>> I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate.  And
>> I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it.
>> ==========
>> I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its eggs in
>> my brain, because later you might think you're having a good idea but
>> it's just eggs hatching.
>> ==========
>> Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right there, in
>> the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to read good books.
>> ==========
>> What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds singing
>> and the wind rustling through the leaves, that makes you want to get
>> drunk?
>> 
>> And after you're real drunk, maybe go down to the public park and
>> stagger around and ask people for money, and then lay down and go to
>> sleep.
>> ==========
>> Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window?  The guy looks out
>> it, and if he leans too far, he falls out.  Wait.  I guess that's like
>> a regular window.
>> ==========
>> During the Middle Ages, probably one of the biggest mistakes was not
>> putting on your armor because you were "just going down to the corner."
>> ==========
>> If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people, like
>> I am now.
>> ==========
>> When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call the
>> police.  But then I got curious about it.  I picked it up, and started
>> wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.
>> ==========
>> I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and whittle
>> all day long.  Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a larger toy boat
>> I had.  It was almost as good as the first one, except now it had bumpy
>> whittle marks all over it.  And no paint, because he had whittled off
>> the paint.
>> ==========
>> Here's a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don't know
>> anybody: First take out the garbage.  Then go around and collect any
>> extra garbage that people might have, like a crumpled napkin, and take
>> that out too.  Pretty soon people will want to meet the busy garbage guy.
>> ==========
>> Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand your rights,
>> even if you don't know what your rights are, or who the person is
>> you're talking to.  Then on the way out, slam the door.
>> ==========
>> If you're a cowboy and you're dragging a guy behind your horse, I bet
>> it would really make you mad if you looked back and the guy was reading
>> a magazine.
>> ==========
>> If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, I think
>> it's okay to feed some bits of your friend to one of the vultures, to
>> teach him to do some tricks.  But only if you're serious about adopting
>> the vulture.
>> ==========
>> Broken promises don't upset me.  I just think, why did they believe me?
>> ==========
>> If you ever crawl inside an old hollow log and go to sleep, and while
>> you're in there some guys come and seal up both ends and then put it
>> on a truck and take it to another city, boy, I don't know what to tell
>> you.
>> ==========
>> One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is, don't run
>> with a wooden stake.
>> ==========
>> If you go to a costume party at your boss's house, wouldn't you think a
>> good costume would be to dress up like the boss's wife?  Trust me, it's
>> not.
>> ==========
>> Most of the time it was probably real bad being stuck down in a dungeon.
>> But some days, when there was a bad storm outside, you'd look out your
>> little window and think, "Boy, I'm glad I'm not out in that."
>> ==========
>> Consider the daffodil.  And while you're doing that, I'll be over here,
>> looking through your stuff.
>> ==========
>> For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here's a tip: why not add a
>> slice of lemon to each jar, for freshness?
>> ==========
>> I'd like to see a nature film where an eagle swoops down and pulls a
>> fish out of a lake, and then maybe he's flying along, low to the ground,
>> and the fish pulls a worm out of the ground.  Now that's a documentary.
>> ==========
>> If I was the head of a country that lost a war, and I had to sign a
>> peace treaty, just as I was signing, I'd glance over the treaty and
>> then suddenly act surprised. "Wait a minute!  I thought we won!"
>> ==========
>> Sometimes you have to be careful when selecting a new name for yourself.
>> For instance, let's say you have chosen the nickname "Fly Head." 
>Normally
>> you would think that "fly Head" would mean a person who has beautiful
>> swept-back features, as if flying through the air.  But think again.
>> Couldn't it also mean "having a head like a fly"?  I'm afraid some people
>> might actually think that.
>> ==========
>> Somebody told me how frightening it was how much topsoil we are losing
>> each year, but I told that story around the campfire and nobody got
>scared.
>> ==========
>> I hope that after I die, people will say of me: "That guy sure owed me
>> a lot of money."
>> ==========
>> I wish I had a dollar for every time I spent a dollar, because then,
>> Yahoo!, I'd have all my money back.
>> ==========
>> I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat."  It's a fake baby
>> duck, which you strap on top of your head.  Then you go swimming
>> underwater until you find a mommy duck and her babies,  and you join
>> them.  Then all of the sudden, you stand up out of the water and roar
>> like Godzilla.  Man those ducks really take off!  Also Baby Duck Hat is
>> good for parties.
>> ==========
>> If you get invited to your first orgy, don't just show up nude.  That's
>> a common mistake.  You have to let nudity "happen."
>> ==========
>> The tired and thirsty prospector threw himself down at the edge of the
>> watering hole and started to drink.  But then he looked around and saw
>> skulls and bones everywhere. "Uh-oh," he thought.  "This watering hole
>> is reserved for skeletons."

thought this was relevent to our list ;)

It's just not right.  Thousands of pilots in our very own country are 
living at
or just below the six figure salary line.  And if that wasn't bad
enough, 
many
of them may  go several weeks or months without a paycheck if they are 
forced
by American Airlines management to strike.

But now you can help.  For about three hundred dollars a day ~ that's 
less than
the price of a 25" television set ~ you can help keep a pilot 
economically
viable during their time of need.

Three hundred dollars a day may not seem like a lot of money to you, 
but 
to a
pilot, it could mean the difference between a vacation fishing in
Florida 
or a
Mediterranean cruise.

For you, three hundred dollars is nothing more than half a month's rent 
or
mortgage payment.  But to a pilot, three hundred dollars a day will 
almost
replace his or her salary.

Three hundred dollars a day will enable a pilot to upgrade his or her 
home
computer, buy that new 100" television set, trade in the 6-month old 
Lexus for a
Ferrari, or enjoy a dinner (with champagne) at The Mansion.

"HOW WILL I KNOW I"M HELPING?"

Each month, you will receive a complete financial report on the crew 
member
you sponsor. Detailed information about his or her stocks,bonds,401K,
and
real-estate holdings will be mailed to your home.  You will be able to
watch your pilot's net worth grow.  You'll also get information on how 
they
chose to invest their 1.2 million dollar lump sum they get upon their
retirement.

"HOW WILL THEY KNOW I'M HELPING?"
Your pilot will be told that her or she has a SPECIAL FRIEND that just 
wants to
help. Although the pilot won't know your name, he or she will be able to 
make
collect calls to your home via a special operator in case they need more 
funds.

I don't know.  The few that I have heard of tend to end badly.  Example:  
All ages concert at Charlie's Bistro about two weeks ago.  It WAS all 
ages until the LCB showed up and had them evict all younger types because 
there was a bar on the premises.  Guarded bar, but a bar.  I was NOT 
happy about that...

a couple a people were asking if I could repost dis shit...here goes:

Summary of stuff:


1)  All submissions for the tape should still be sent to me at=20

	Jim Gourgoutis
	c/o GALT Technologies, Inc.
	Suite 750
	5001 Baum Blvd.
	Pittsburgh, PA  15213-1851

Again, EMAIL ME BEFORE you send stuff (skoop@galt.com) so I know to =
expect it.  Put the subject "TAPE COMP" in your mail.  I'd like =
submissions to include 2 tracks, so if we don't get alot of submits, =
this tape could still get made.  If you send multiple tracks, state =
which one you'd most like us to use, in the event we only have space for =
one track per submission.  Keep tracks to a reasonable length (ie. under =
10 minutes).  I guess now we're accepting either cassettes or DAT tapes. =
 (Tea???)  Include any contact info (email addys, phone numbers, URL's, =
etc) and artist/track names as appropriate...keep it short.

2) The tape will include people from pgh & cleveland, since that is the =
scope of this list.  It seems as if there are many people from both =
places that are interested in this. =20

3) Once I get enough submissions, I will drop them all off with Tea, and =
he will be in charge of doing the mastering/mixing/whatever. =20

4) Submissions will not be returned unless specifically requested and a =
proper (ie. padded, whatever) SASE is enclosed.

5) Anyone who wants to do a J-card for the tape should do so, and then =
when the time comes, we will get them posted on the web somewhere and =
vote on them.  If you're seriously going to do a j-card, email me and =
put the subject "J-CARD" in your mail so I can set up a list to keep you =
updated.

6) Tea wants to put the final mix up as a Realaudio file at his website. =
 I think this is an excellent idea.  Anyone who doesn't want their =
track(s) included in this should say so when they submit material.

7) We need ideas for the name...so far "midland mayhem" has been =
suggested...and will probably be it unless someone tops it.

8) Tentatively, there is going to be one side mixed, one side not.  =
Please indicate preference or "don't care" when you submit material.

9) I *will* accept submissions from non-listmembers, but listmembers get =
first priority in the event that we get more submits than tape space =
permits.

10) Regardless of musical *styles*, submissions should be of electronic =
(techno/industrial/house/jungle/ambient/gabber/trance/acidjazz/whatever) =
music ONLY.  No guitar-rock bands, please. =20


that's about it.

Well, that sounds like a reasonable idea to me, 'cause if you don't have 
the tracks together within a month or so, you probably won't get them 
together in six months.  Best to take what you get and when that project 
is completed, perhaps it will provide incentive for those who didn't make 
it on the first tape to get organized for the second.  Like I said, I've 
got a track or two for the comp, 187 said he'll put one on it, Pete has 
one but hasn't sent it in yet.  Other than that, I don't have contact 
with anyone else.

So send those tapes in, folks!

When they took the fourth amendment, I was quiet because I didn't deal
drugs.
When they took the sixth amendment, I was quiet because I was innocent.
When they took the second amendment, I was quiet because I didn't own a
gun.
Now they've taken the first amendment, and I can say nothing about it.

That looks pretty good. And it's cheap $3 (all of which goes to the
Gammage Family). All of you junglists on the list who have college I.D.
ought to come down.If you do not have an I.D. Email me and I may be able
to get you on my guest list. So far I have no one on it so email me before
Friday morning if you want on it. Also Soma Mestiso is pretty good, you
ought to check them out, they are more Trip-Hop than anything else despite
what the e-flyer says.

Hey all,  I am back with the flyer scans after a couple of months 
absence.

I will be putting out some quality reduced size images of all the 
altest flyer paste-ups I find laying around or that people mail to 
me.

Average Flyer is like 40k per side.

If you would like to be added to a flyer ONLY mailing list to keep 
track of the latest event send email to:

kmf@kmf.org
with the subject line of:  ADD FLYERS

you will receive a letter indicating that you have been added and 
will start receiving scans from then onward.

Most flyers will be from the Pittsburgh/Erie/Columbus sector of the 
earth- but there are some others thrown in there as well.

An archive of past PGH/CLE/ERIE/COL. flyers can be found on 
Hyperreal.com.   The URL for the directory is:

http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/pb-cle/flyers/

Peace out...

Does anyone have or know where i could get the hi-res version of the logo
that's on the web page?.  We are putting together a badge design and it would
be very useful. The original format it was created in would be great
(Photoshop-whatever) but just a higher resolution would do..


Thanx

Hey Y'all...

	I'm *very* excited right now, 'cause I'm holding in my grubby 
little hands my very first personalized dubplate!  Watch out Kent, 
because tonight you are going to hear some never before released tunes by 
myself, the ^x^c ("send breaks"), and the 1.8.7.  WATCH!!!!

        well, i've heard copyright cats have been crackin down in clubs wit
pps playin some rekkids. or so Rob (pulserver) told me one day. AND i know
they've been gettin pps for sendin software over tha net. ya know, the age
old FREE INFO struggle. some people REALLY WORK HARD TO CONTROL simple songs
and knowledge. anyways.....

        for copyright bullshit i'd advise a white label type of thing wit a
# to contact wit a promotion squad name or DJ name or a "pseudo" DJ name (ya
know, FAKE). NOTHIN WIT A NAME. maybe even have it so there's jus a # ta
call ta order more CDs or wax. or maybe jus give the necessary info to tha
distributers (if ya go that route). but WATCH OUT.. fizederal Jake Po-po is
on the lookout for pps spreadin info an song!!!

Does anyone know if Mystic is supposed to be worth going.  I went to
Technique last month and it was a waste.  Is Mystic supposed to me Trance
or Ambient?

just make sure your not selling the tape to an fbi agent and we'll all be
fine. seriously, weve mentioned getting cd's pressed, but not by a
distrubutor or a maunfacturer..with a cd burner...its all underground..its
all good. its about as illegal as trading dead bootlegs or taping rented
videos and they dont care about that unless they know peeps r getting mad
money. thats not our intention; its exposure.=)

BMI and ASCAP are prolly the ones...  the scoop is, it is illegal to play
the radio in a publically occupied building, and play most major-label
stuff, unless it says for promotional use only.  or cover another bands
song.  
-unless- you (meaning the bar or other public place) pay ascap or bmi a
sh*tload of money.  notice when you go into the gap or whatever in the mall
that they arent playing the radio?  they are playing _licensed_ music that
is piped in usually from a satellite uplink or cable or otherwise.  bmi and
ascap collect royalties and somehow distribute them out to the artists.
bmi has a www site that is linked somewhere off one of my pages (it says
"good for a laugh" somewhere near it :) .... everyone wants their share....
