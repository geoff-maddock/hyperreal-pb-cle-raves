That is really messed-up.  I hope your friend is ok Ken.  Was that at Mass
Konfusion?  Did people do anything to stop those assholes from beating on
your friend?  I can't really speak for every raver, but I can definately
say that shit's not what pittsburgh raving is about.  If people can agree
on anything, its that violence is not how to deal with your problems.

On the other hand, you do have to be careful who you point a video camera
at, because some people are very touchy about it whether or not they're
doing elicit acts.   A friend of mine just took a photo in oakland of some
punks one day and one guy ran after her and demanded her camera, then when
she wouldn't give it to him, he just grabbed it and smashed it.

It's stupid, but it happens.

I personally think PLUR, while in theory is a good set of virtues, is
more or less bullshit in practice.  There's not really any more peace love
unity or respect in the 'rave scene' than any other group of kids.   Of
course no-one is perfect, and to have ideals to look up to is better than
none at all.  It just seems too much like a 'slogan'.

In other words, I don't think you can say raving is about anything in
particular, because its different things to different people.  But its
definately not about beating up people with video cameras filming raves.
We'll leave that to the pittsburgh police. :P

l8s,

Hey, the un-rave went off beautifully (although not without small
difficulties, but it was all good.)  Sorry to all who didn't make it. we
ran farmer Tea's tables through my stereo (Thanks Tea!!!!!!!!) and Tea,
Joe 187, and Adair basically tagteamed for a coup[le hours to see whose
skills would deteriorate first under a couple influences.  

although it was really, really cool I apologize to anyone who brought
records and ended up not spinning.

Regardless, it was lovely.  We sat in my furniture-less thrid floor room
with fuzzy blankets, a blue light bulb, Southern Comfort and coconut rum,
and an INCREDIBLE sense of magical, friendly energy. There were about 20
people chilling at the busiest and it was perfectly cozy.  Everyone had a
peaceful little grin as far as I could tell. damn, if I were going to
be around I'd try to have these as often as possible.

Many, many thanks to Joe, Michaela and Toby, plus Frank, Todd, Geoff,
Amie, and all other friends and friends of friends who came and helped put
together a perfect end to a _very_ interesting year.

To those who didn't make it, well, maybe we'll catch up if you're ever in
Philly.  :)

Talk to you in a few days, from across the state.

This post might not make total sense...My eyes are drooping from many days
with little sleep, but it doesn't
matter.  Last night, I saw the future.

(Or so said DJ S. S. while he was ont he mic late into the evening)

This was my first bassrush (baltimore) and although it wasn't flawless
(I'll leave
those descriptions to others) it was definitely mindblowing and grandiose.
Lots and lots of people, great music, split vibe.  

I hung in the jungle.  This is where I am and this is where I'm staying.
Damn, Mthod One, Entity, and I think there was one other b4 1.8.7 were all
slammin, I danced and danced.  Joe 1.8.7 knighted me head cook and bottle
washer of the horn crew, and I gladly accepted. I flipped out to his set 
as
usual, and so did most of the rest of the room.  "The Way we Rock" is one
hell of a room-mover.  Nuff respect!  His set was pretty solid and people
seemed to love it.  He also had a neato dancer with white
feathers (shouts to kirstian) and people dug it.  

Soulslinger started hard, and I think Warren G was on the mic so you know
it was good.  I needed mad water and unfortunately b/c of logistics I
ended up not hearing too much of Soulslinger's set.  It ended smooth and
jazzy.  Nice. 

But then Warren G introduced the next DJ
------ooooooo  mmmmmyyyyyyy   ggggoooooooooooddddddd----------

			D J  S  S  in full effect

he dropped the needle and I don't know what hit me, but i just stood there
and yelled oh my god as well...mesmerized...

it changed people's lives, broke through writer's block for some, made me
see the music in a whole new way.  I was completely uninhibited and broke
all my normal party habits, such as getting tired and stopping after a
while, being a little self-conscious about how I look, not risking
dehydration, a bunch of stuff.  All out the window.  Mad horns and
whistles int he place, jumpin everywhere, incredible.  Every couple of
tracks I'd jump up and down in awe and yell, "Oh My GOD!!!!"  I didn't
even know why.  Felt it through my whole body.

I still stand by everything I've said along the US/UK vein, but now I
realize just how redundant this next statement is...
You simply haven't heard jungle till you've heard it live and direct UK
style.  

Of course, I'm saying this based on the experience of one DJ and MC.  But
now it all makes sense, the grooverider or hype or etc tapes with whistles
and horns nonstop, the energy, why this is so big across the pond.

as i said, it all came together for me last night.  So, ok, I support
local scenes cuz it's a good thing to do.  I suppport the jungle scenes
cuz i love the music.  but now, all that support finally makes sense.
There is a purpose.  When you hear a set like that with a beautiful
interaction between the MC and the DJ's music choice that just gets people
completely hyped up, you don't have a body anymore.  It's all energy.
Every human being should have a chance to feel that amazingly overwhelmed.
That's the goal.  That's why I stand by the Pittsburgh crew (who I think
deserved a couple more shouts, hint hint), my new Philly crew, the US
massive and the worldwide massive.

(Mind you I was on no illegal drugs and the room was small compared to a
lot of events in England.  I can't imagine how crushing it would be under
even more overwhelming circumstances.)

I got such an education out of last night.  I don't know whether to give
up trying to spin altogether or run out and buy a stack of records...or an
asr 10 for that matter.  :)  I have sooooo many questions, most of which I
don't think would work outside of real time. Oh well.  just have to wait
for Bassrush Oct rush to flag down Warren G and SS (who gave me a kiss on
the cheek! :) and buy them dinner and make them talk aobut how they do
across the pond.

To the UK massive, I get it now.  All I can say is thank you for coming up
with this music.  To the US massive, keep it up!!!  We really do try hard,
and we're gettign better all the time.  

omigosh 
i will be a junglist till death 
respect to those who come correct
so babies like me can catch on to the real deal

btw, the rest of the party was cool too, but I was a little wiped out and
didn't pay real close attention.

shouts to Tea and 1.8.7, wonderful road trip companions, and to
Soulslinger for his hard work, and words of wisdom about Brazil.

Sorry about my screwy mail program...
As someone coming from the west coast, it makes me kind of sad to hear
someone say that peace and love  don't happen in the rave scene, because
if you go to the right parties there, they do. Of course we have some
problems/lame promoters/idiots, but I think anyone who has been to a
full moon party in the great outdoors, grooving with a couple hundred
other happy souls, will know what I'm talking about. 
Realistically, (was that spelled right?) it is possible to make a party
more than just some aggro punk concert (not that there's anything wrong
with that, but when I go to a rave, I'm looking for a different
attitude, a different feeling.)
Anyway, that was my little rant...
Hope to be seeing some of you in the near future
Erica

Ya know I find that whole story a little hard to believe!  I'm not saying 
that people (out of towners I belive they were...am I correct) were lying 
BUT I have been to many raves in many different places throughout the 
east coast and the best raves I have been to are the ones in Pittsburgh! 
I found the best vibe there, the most exciting crowd and the most "PLUR" 
there than any where else...
I agree with Geoff when he says that PLUR is more said than done take for 
instance the comments I received when I was down at Eclipse in 
April...some random guy walks up to me and says [with an attitude]..."You 
look like you don't belong...you don't look like you're having a very good 
time" Well it was obvious that guy hadn't been watching me for very long 
since I was dancing [only at that moment resting and looking for 
someone]...I had my hair in a braid and he told me I was too dressed up 
WHY was that...that is the shit I've had to deal with outside of 
Pittsburgh...I wanted the resopect then...I didn't know there was a 
specific dress code and everything to go along...don't we go to raves to 
partially get away from all the bullshit of everyday? (I know that's one 
of the reasons I go!). Oh Well looking forward to the next Pittsburgh 
party now that I'm back in Indiana, Pa!
Love-
\Nicole

I sent a message to that house4all bullshit list that everyones been
complaining about and it got returned. Does that mean that little fiasco is
over??? I hope so... I like this list a lot but I couldn't handle another
one; I came back from Bassrush to find myself with 138 email messages.
        Anyway, I still don't know how to give a review of Bassrush.
Everything was overwhelming. It was one of the biggest parties I've ever
been to and I didn't know a lot of people. I saw a lot of people from
Pittsburgh however, and started to miss it a lot. I'm in such a
transitional period in my life that I really didn't know what to say to
them. I enjoyed seeing their smiling faces, but i couldn't find it in
myself to rave with them; i felt so alone. I'm not in Pittsburgh anymore,
but i want to be. Enough about my personal life, pete <sigh> (I made a lot
of new friends:) don't fret)
        Much props to Stephanie's review; I was in the jungle room more
than any other room, but it got so damn hot in there. KMC was AWESOME!!!
There were some great breakers there as well. Thanks for 412 representing
joe and damian!!
        I'm sorry but I really don't respect the Bassrush crew for making
us fucking pay for WATER!! A 24-hour event, $35 a head, lots of people who
need water to SURVIVE (with or without illicit substances), and the
promoters can't find it in their wallet or heart to give us water?? Someone
working at the food stand told me the town cut off the water supply. What a
lame ass excuse. Granted it was a small town (who's ever heard of
Boonsboro?) and there were more people at the rave than probably live in
the town, but why would the town endanger to lives of 2000+ kids to benefit
the wallets of the promoters??? It sounds awful phishy to me. Either the
Bassrush crew paid off the city to do that or it was an excuse to make
money.
        If I lived in the Baltimore/ D.C. area I would let my promoter know
that ravers at their parties should get what they pay for and have rights
to a safe time. It sounds like I'm getting worked up over nothing, but what
they had was a monopoly on life. They knew these kids had money and they
knew they needed water. Although I would be somewhat surprised if someone
died of heat exhaustion, if someone did, I could see a big controversy stir
up over the liability. If I was a promoter I would want to avoid this....

I think I'm going to stick to Pittsburgh parties....:)

yes SS ripped it !! once again me and some of my mates from boston(8hr
drive) was more into trace's set.even though ss's style is more
understandable by the crowd at hand.all and all everybody did a good job
except a couple.since i am biased.some of the dj's that spun was
complaining about one dj's mixing(i am not saying no names) and didn't
understand how he got booked.to me it didn't matter!if i didn't like this
dj's set i am not going to listen to it! so to get back to the subject
.Trace just did it for me with the most innovative dubplates from doc
scott,ed rush,hydrolosis,and to many to mention.strictly
techstep.smoooooking!

Hey there.  Don't know if this will get thru.  I hate aol.  it is crap.  but
it's all I have til i telnet to my pitt account by hook or by crook.  yes,
this is stephanie a, in chester county--not my dad (edgar).  

anyways, pete, there _was_ water @ bassrush in the first aid booth by the
main entrance.  the doors were wide open all night and the water was cold.
 But if you didn't know, chances are neither did a lot of other people.  They
should ahve made the availability much clearer.  

Btw, I think I really relate to how you're feeling...kinda lonely out
here...Many thanks to joe and Amie for the crash space, and to Amie, truly a
saint angel if ever there was one, for saving my ass yet again by getting me
to the airport. a\nd I found that 20....you will pay, my sweet, the next time
I'm in 611 records.  ;)

I'm computer dumb.  I almost have telnet and windsock downloaded and
installed to this hd so I can telnet thru dad's aol, but not quite.  Tried
stuff like "telnet://sol.cis.pitt.edu" and things like that and it said I
didn't ahve permission.  Anyone know a back door to sneak in to pitt (cuz
doing it the right way simply isn't enough fun)?  

Go ahead and write to scast3+@pitt.edu cuz i'll be checking that via the
public library or friends at WestChesterU, or respond to pb-cle and I'll read
the archives.

Must sleep.  hope all is well.

Okay people, I have a crazy idea. (I can't fall asleep b/c of it). My
birthday is coming up (October 13th), and I wanna throw a quality birthday
party. As some of you may know, the night before this, PHATO productions is
throwing URANUS.   So any of you in the pb-cle area wanting to do something
this weekend, read this. I will keep everyone notified about specifics, but
first want to throw this idea out.

                            because URANUS is so far away....

                T.R.A.N.C.E. in association with FUEL Productions
                             and the University Concert Committee
                                               present

                                              VENUS

                                        State College, PA
                                        October 12, 1996

                                 (it's also a birthday party!)

 (note: There are many people I must talk to individually before This will
actually happen, especially Rick/Stickman. Does anyone have is number? IF
nothing comes of this, i still have a dream. The cool thing is this dream
isn't unrealistic. SO if I mention names and you're like "what?? i didn't
say i'd do this", you're right; but I would ABSOLUTELY LOVE it if you did:)

THE CATCH: This party is in State College.  I have a list of reasons why
this party will be awesome, and why you should come up:
        1. IT's only 2 1/2 -3 hours away from Pittsburgh, and the drive is
aesthetically pleasing. If things work out, Phil/Candyman will have a
Bustrip!! I could even come and pick people up!!

        2. Okay, DJ's. Headlining I would love

1.8.7 to do a live PA. (I still idol you joe, ever since my first rave: 31
flavors [may I also spend this time to say that your set at Bassrush was
musically intellectual, soulfully hard stepping, and totally raw) Also
headlining would love

DCYPOL yes everyone loves his tape. His feelgood style has a reputation and
has made my jaws hurt from smiling (Permagrin in effect!) (how can I get a
hold of him? Is he stilll in Pittsburgh? I saw him at Bassflush)

There are a few who have already expressed interest in spinning out:

FARMER TEA (WRCT, PGH)
SMARTIE. (Alien Love Tribe, PGH) can you guyz make it?

COUNT ZERO:  Would you like to spin a chill set?? DO you spin jungle now as
well?  Let me know if you would like to spin.

Maybe
ERIC D (N'sync) would be interested.

I'd like to mention the willing Dj's WILL get paid because otherwise I only
need to pay for Promotion (Location, Sound, Light, Lasers and VRAVE
terminals to URANUS will take some kissing ass, but will probably all be
free, compliments of PSU).

         I also want
BLEEP (Trevor) to play (I also don't know how to get a hold of him.)

Don't worry if you can't make it anybody. I have backup dj plans, but I've
only listed Dj's who I know have ROCKED the house, and would sort of
understand what my vision is all about. I have friends that know dj's in NY
and Philly as well, so we might have another headliner.

Whoah i'm not done. I might have a couple hip-hop dj's as well, because
there are some mad freestylin' skillz up here and in pittsburgh (much
respect to jeremy)

3. I already had a dream about this party. The vibe was amazing, and the
spirit of many others is there. What IF, this party in URANUS had a live
video broadcast via satellite to VENUS?
Now that's an interplanetary journey if I've ever heard of one. IT is
definately possible to have VRAVE terminals to URANUS, provided they have
computers.

4. What if someone drove from URANUS to VENUS  or vice versa in a SATURN?
Any ravers from MARS, PA? (okay pete youre getting delerious. it's five in
the morning)

respect to: Stickman, Phil and N'sync, 168, aDk, Sunshine Kids. I have
promoted you're parties this summer because I know they were going to be
fun. With your help I'd like to recapture some of that PLUR the jive
turkeyz stirred up with SUCK, MI GNUTTS and related outlaw efforts. To
those who weren't there, those were two different parties, although
combined they have sort of the same meaning....

If you've got this far along this message, i'm proud of you. I'll keep you
posted on everything. This is a non-profit party in the making, so by
helping me you are doing a good deed. I'm so excited! I know i've never
thrown a party before, and don't plan on doing it that often, but this is a
special occasion in which i wanna thank everyone for how much fun i had
this summer.

Hi all,

Sorry to drop this off-topic post in your bucket, but I'm hoping
someone in the Cleveland area can give me some info.

I may be taking a software contracting position in Oberlin, OH for
6-12 months and need to find out about places to live and cost of
housing.  I'll be moving out there form New Jersey.  Basically, do 
any of you know what the rent is for a 3 bedroom house/townhouse 
somewhere in commuting distance to Oberlin in a decent neighborhood?  
(What would be really great is if someone has a URL for the classified 
section of a local newspaper or something similar.)

Now more rave related...

Are there any good weekly events going on in Cleveland?  I've only
been to 1 Cleveland rave about 1 1/2 years ago.  How's the scene
these days?

Please send replies to my e-mail addy as I'm not (yet) subscribed
to this list.  If this works out, I'm sure I'll be meeting some
of you in the near future.

Thanks,
Wayne.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can

Hi all, 

I'm sending this to a few regional rave related email lists..

I'm part of a trance/acid band based in Los Angeles called Skylab2000. We 
play at parties in LA and all around the country on a pretty regular 
basis... (Those of you in the Chicago are may have seen us last weekend at 
the three day Rave Em and Bailey party) We have bunch of tracks out including 
a few 12"s and stuff on mix CDs by Taylor, Keoki, and John Kelly. Enough info 
- have a look at our web page if ya wanna know more..

Anyway, now and again we send out new promo packs. Now's the time.

If you are a promotor, please email me. We are looking for events to play, 
and will be happy to send a promo pack.. 

peace

Space : nice downtown two room building with a an outdoor chill space

Sound : two sound system

Lights : minimal in the second
good in the main room.

DJ :
Mickey B : really nice happy hardcore set...he did beautiful

Lars : he blew away any house dj in the midwest. I don't like house too much, 
but damm, he set was extremely powerfull. His music was way better than Josh 
Wink and a lot more dancable

Ribbs : he played good hard trance

Graeme : really good house set.

Sonar : Really good happy hard core

KMC : Jungle from hell....whoa

Diablo : spun Euro-house on 3 turntables...beautiful

Matt : upcoming house dj in the midwest.

Tigger : good house set

Jason Clark : good good ambient


Remark : I am really getting pissed of at the majority of the scene in the 
midwest. First because of the massive amont of drugs being consumed and second 
because Evolution brings really good talent to Louisville, and just a few 
people appreciating it. Why hear the same old fucking boring djs ?

anyways...I am out. ciao...don't need to reply, I am unsubscribing from every 
list. I had enough.

Well I must interject here Mr. "French E".  I feel I need to reply to 
this.  The Evolution promoting crew may bring really good talent to 
Lousiville but as you said "Why hear the same old fucking boring djs ?"  
You said it yourself.  At Excaliber three, count them, three of the djs 
that spun have recently spun in the midwest AND two of them at a previous 
Evolution party (Lars-Coccoon in chicago, MikeyB/Diablo AND 
Ribbz--Bassrush the Midwest Rush in Louisville)  This leaves 5 quality 
djs ALL of whom spin different types of music.  Personally when I goto a 
party I usually like to hear basically 2-3 sets of the same type of music 
by djs who have not been here in quite a while.  

A suggestion from me, MikeyD, 8 headliners is WAY TOO MANY.  Support your 
locals.  Give the local talent a chance to prove themselves on the 
"almighty-god Maxximum Sound system".  Locals are what make the 
scene work not the long distance travelers.  Give the Louisville scene a 
chance.

Well as I stated before a reply is very much needed.  And what is up with 
this "I am out.  ciao.......I had enough."  This is the kind of attitude 
that brings the scene down.  You may have done a lot for the midwest 
rave scene by bringing high quality sound to the parties, but the elitest 
attitude you are showing leads me to believe I can have a better time 
without the sound expertise you may have.

Trace is on the flyer? 
Well, anyway, I'm goin' to that thing.  The one here.  You know. That
thing.  I could keep going, but I'll stop now.  Still never heard the
infamous 'Carlos', whom people in pgh seem to have a complete fixation
with.  Well, I want to hear for me-self.

Not sure if i'll be hitchin' the Big-ol' Oakland bus or driving an auto
yet...more info on the bus would be cool - like if it'll cost anything.
Hopefully I'll be bringing some phun kids on my 1-horse open sleigh. 

Any new kids from Pitt or CMU, or anywheres, email me and maybe we can go
together, or if you see some kid at 'that thing' with green liberty
spikes, say "hey geoff, what-up?" :)

Also...if you'r not at Steel City on Tues night/Wed morning, say between
1-3 am, turn on WPTS 92.1 FM to get you'r dose of hard-edged techno.  I'll
mostly be spinning jungle, gabber, and happy hardcore, but be ready for
some surprizes...;)

later kids,

Hi to everyone on this list  and beyond who supported us this weekend,
and all the ones who didn't make it this time for one reason or another,
but should definitlly come and check an Erie party out next time after
hearing what happened this weekend.

This is Viktor from Liquid Sound Distortion (LSD).

Quantum Bass was an outright success. Despite some initial problems
(sorry that there wasn't a third room, but the third floor of the
building was completely flooded, as were the first two consequently on
Saturday morning due to the heavy rain brought by hurricane "Fran" and
the roof giving in. Lot's of thanks to Yamma and his supporting crew for
the clean-up efforts.), the party started on time with a slightly
reshuffled time schedule. The turnout was massive, and everyone (from
DeeJays, hard core ravers, to first timers) loved the vibe, the
atmosphere, the friendliness, and especially the boxing ring in the
second room. The party went on well into Sunday, and lots of people
chose to stay to see, hear, and experience some other DJ's as well. 

We tried to assemble an array of DJ's and musical styles such that
everyone can identify with the music that they love -breaks, trance,
jungle, electro, goa, trip-hop, ambient, freestyle ...  Maybe some of
the music was different and harder (i.e. Jordan and the Brainfroot boys)
than what the people of this area are normally used to, but no one
seemed to object or dislike it. It was just a new experience in the
underground journey.

We want to thank everyone that made this party happen, and be as
successful as it was, but our biggest respect, in no particular order of
merit, goes to Lee and the U.P.S. crew, Smoov and the 168 boys,
Stickman, N'sync, Aaron and all of the Brainfroot guys (Brandon, good
luck in Colorado), Smartie - you were great, Eric D, Candy Man, Marcos
and Buffalo, Vinnie and Ryan. Sorry if we missed anyone, but you deserve
props just as much.

We're already planning another party - IN SEARCH OF Mr. YAMMA - that
will be coming to you some time in early February. 
Stay tuned for flyers and more info on this event.

Thanks to all with a hope to see you all soon.

Peace,

Viktor Mizo

    I might have some room in my car for those in the Oakland/Squirrel
Hill area.  I'm going to the Tori concert the same night, but I need to
go home and change, so if anyone really needs a ride, I can probably fit
1 or 2...

Ok kids, I just found out my radio show on WPTS is now 1-3am Tuesday, so
it no longer conflicts with Steel City. Yay!

So tune in tonight at 1 for...

"The As Yet Unnamed Radio Show"  Tues. 1-3am (as in Monday night)  
 *WPTS 92.1*  with Your Amature Selektaz: 
 Q6ert Ranx, spinning jungle that'd make your grandmother jump-up
  and Dr. Giggles, spinning hardcore, gabber and happy HC :)

Don't expect the finest mixing, but plenty of cool tunes for you nokturnal
kids out there. :)

l8s,

 -<Q6ert Rankx>-

everyone...

sorry for the crosspost, i dont usually do this kind of thing, but in this
case, i beleive it is *that important*....

i work for a major corporation, and i _know_ what kind of information is
tracked on an individual...TRW, for example, maintains an exhaustive
database on over 90 million (i think) individuals (i have the manual for
TRW here in the office)...they can track very specific segments of the
population...for example, i can pull out the manual for TRW and order a
report that would list people under age 25, who are vegetarians, who
have bought blue jeans in the past six months, who wear glasses, who are
registered democrats, and who make under $30,000 a year...

when i read the email that is reprinted below.. it made me very scared...i
called IMMEDIATELY and followed the procedures listed... i called the 800
#, pressed #4, then pressed #3 then i was connected to an operator.. i told
her "i dont know if my name is listed on your database, but if it is, i'd
like it removed, please" she then transferred me to another operator..he
asked for my name, (first and last) and social security number...i gave him
the information and then he said "ok, we'll remove you from our
database"...i plan on calling in a week, as a followup, to insure that it
*was* done.  the whole process took about 5 minutes, most of which was
spent on hold, but i think that it was a 5 minutes very well spent.  (i
called at approximately 1pm EST, so it wasnt too long a wait, considering)

thanks go out to karin, i really appreciated you passing this along.. and
please - FORWARD THIS TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS THAT YOU FEEL WOULD BENEFIT FROM
THIS KNOWLEDGE.

peace,
hossam

That's where i went for my second rave, more than a year ago: FUEL
Productions presented
DAEDALUS, the same night as the dead show and a week after Tunnelvision, so
a lot of paranoid ravers didn't come. That's why the vibe was so good that
night :)

I don't know about pressed, but if you'd like to get one airbrushed, you 
could go to It's Art at Ross Park Mall (ickyicky).  They've got fairly 
good prices there if you're not looking for a stencil.

That's the only way to grow the scene.  Not all frat people are hopeless.
Most, but not all.  People don't get into stuff they don't know exists.

just heard about a party going on this friday in akron, as a pre-party to
the free party on saturday.  i dont remember the full lineup but i know
entity, sun, feelgood, and synapse are all spinning.  i dont have the info
line either, but if you need it, you can call dreamers voicemail at
216.238.1451 and listen to the party info.

also spawntaneous is having a friday night party on the 20th with james
christian, sleepy c live pa, gank + an all jungle room featuring tik tak
with more to be announced.  2167797188 for info on that.

also i saw messages mentioning that THAT THING isn't in pittsburgh, just
wanted to know if this makes it closer to cleveland or farther away, i'd
definitely want to check it out, but i might just check out the akron party
instead.

later on...

somebody told me a while ago that there was a jungle room at trilogy
but saturday nite i went there with my mom + her friends (it was my
21st birthday so my mom wanted to take me to the flats, but she says
she's too old--42--to stay out all nite that's why she didn't want 
to go to a party, although she's been to 1 before) but there was no
jungle room + the music is like very hard house + trance. at least it
wasn't like when i was there like last year or something + it was like
industrial/alternative(yuck)/occasionally trance. so does anybody know
if there's supposed to be a jungle room? also i saw all these signs 
for a record store so i went to find it + it was closed. the bartender
said it was open only on fri + sun. that doesn't make any sense. 
then when we left my mom's friend said her car probably wouldn't be
there when she got back since she parked it in a free parking lot,
plus it's a jaguar (with HYDRAULICS! cool...) so when she found her 
car, the doors were still locked, but the radio was on really loud +
the lights were on + the battery was dead. but what is weird is that u
can't turn them on without the keys in the ignition. maybe somebody
tried to hotwire it but didn't finish. anyway, the whole nite was a
very surreal experience.

And the moral of the story is . . .

GO ON SUNDAY (unless of course you want to be kool like Jennifer Wylde of
WMMS -- isn't she the "dj" that night?) 

I think the unofficial theme of Saturday at Trilogy is "Big Hair West
Sider" night.  Plus, if you're a guy and you wear gold chains and really
colorful leather shoes with your greased back hair, I hear you get a free
beer.  Gosh knows I'm there . . . with a chick in the back of my sleak
black Sunbird blasting "Macaraina" from my heavy bass souped up stereo
system.  I'll be the one named, "Guido".  :)

Bitch bitch bitch, moan, moan. Most people are HAPPY it's here as this was
the site to many legendary Pittsburgh parties,  Trancedence 1 and 2, Boom
and of course Daedalus. Would you rather it was at 168?


> dirty....far away....damnit! 

It's not that dirty and it's not that far (you can take the shuttle if
worse comes to worse)  . If you think the fairgrounds is dirty you should
have been in the place where Bassrush Summer Rush was held. Just wear some
clothes you don't mind getting dirty.Leave the Polo and Hilfiger at home
for a change. People came out Bassrush covered with dirt and smiling,
because they genuinely had fun. You know what they say, you didn't have
fun if you didn't get dirty.


> why is it even called a 'pittsburgh' rave???

What would you call it? A Washington County rave? Ask yourelf this:
Why is Bassrush or half of Ultraworld's parties called Baltimore raves?
Because that is the metropolitan area they are closest to. Duh. Funny
thing was that Bassrush summer Rush was in a Washington County Auction
House, Maryland's Washington County that is.

Where do you think the rave scene came from here my friend. There was no
ready made dance culture, we used to hand out fliers anywhere youth
gathered, malls, movies, and yes even frats. Many of the nicest ravers
were introduced to it from this type of promoting.Hell I remmember Buda
used to even go to Heavy Metal concerts and pass out fliers (brave man).
Thing to remmember is that 1) No one was born a rave and 2) The scene that
does not grow, dies - and in case you haven't seen what promoting JUST to
"ravers" has done to the scene recently then ask your self when was the
last time you went to a Pittsburgh party that topped 1,000.

> ....(feels like it's going to suck....)

Stay home then. Plenty of newbies were at TunnelVision and that party was
a blast. Infact I would say parties with new people are refreshingly
energetic compared to the ones where you have the same old jaded raver
crowd (half of whom are SITTING on the fucking floor by 4am).

Okay people, i've been through a lot in the past week and haven't done any
homework!!
As it turns out, the school will not sponsor a venue such as my original
idea (VENUS) becuase of the fact that i would be charging people (even
though i wouldn't be profiting at all). Anyway, because of the  lack of
cooperation with the school and after recieving hate mail and nasty
comments on the name (PHATO has a planet party the same day), I have
decided to change this party upside down and inside out: (people have tried
this b4 with the school, but i have persistence, confidence and optimsm)

A.  It's now called Mi Pinus. There are many many reasons for this, and i
can give you a couple.
1. Sounds like a good name to salute URANUS to.
2. it will be a lot like the Jive Turkeyz free party called Mi Gnutts (My
favorite party this summer) becuase it will be on a university campus (PSU)
and will be 100% FREE!!!
3. Think of the conversations people will have about it: "Who's spinning at
Mi Pinus?" "Dis Dick." and on and on...

B. Since this party is free, i can't afford to have dj's from st. louis and
orlando fla., but the lineup hasn't changed all that much. l
SMARTIE (alien love tribe, pittsburgh)
FARMER TEA (first class sound, wpts, pittsburgh)
KAROVA (presence, pittsburgh/baltimore)
BLISS (activated magazine, activated ingredients, baltimore) (could you
spin for cheap?)
NITRO (dosemE, altoona PA)
JOHN HOFFMAN (local house cat, FR8 yard, allentown)
possibly 1.8.7 on the decks :)

[=-and more TBA-=]

C. 100% Flava, Less Hype
my flyers will be alot like the jive turkeyz renegades. Rick has taught me
so much this summer and i owe a lot to him.[ If your listening Rick, Curly
from boston sez hi and he wants a tape of the Deadly Buda TRIBUTE] I'm
putting the Jive Turkeyz name on this flyer because we are now associates.
(I haven't talk to rick yet, but i definatley think he'll dig this party,
even if he is going to URANUS. Much Respect to the Jive Turkeyz who have
been showing pittsburgh the real deal for about two years now. If any
ravers went Penn State, they would agree that this kind of event is so
desperately needed up here.

D. That's all for now. Stay tuned. Youll see me and flyers at That thing..

Props to ya Pete!!! I hope Mi Pinus comes to a climatic conclusion!!!
I would be happy to attend this party, however I am mysteriously drawn to
the party dubbed URANUS give my regards to the ravahs that attend.

One more Thing and i'll swear i'll leave everybody alone for now.....
You can go to Mi Pinus and URANUS!!!!
Because of the nature of this party, it makes no sensze to have it on a
Saturday.
The new date will be Friday October 11th 1996..
(so d.Cypol and Stickman , and everyone else who wants to go to URANUS can get
Mi Pinus in b4 Uranus:)

Hey, I just called the inpho line and it looks as if it's not free 
anymore, it's going to be $5 and it's going to be at tappan lake.  The 
directions were somewhat confusing though, because it says "Make a *left 
on west shore* right after the marina blah blah blah.  After making a 
*right on west shore* go half mile" ...so first it says right, then 
left..anybody know? :) Thanks

Chris

at 2am in the main room near where the lighting console is set up. I will
be there with a bunch of lamanents. The second will be in the other room

lo fello net ravers,
        i'm back at penn state after a wonderful night in pittsburgh.
washington county fairgrounds was BUMPin' yo. i met a lot of wonderful
people including beautiful girls from new york and baltimore (got the
digits baby!)  it seems as though every great party, i meet a set of
extrordinarily attractive females.
        ANYWAY, it seems as though there were some problems in the
beginning of the night. two different pairs of dealers got gaffled, one
with like 80 some viles of K.    R. and M. also got arrested, but they got
bailed out by the time Carlos spun. Not that i really care that these
events happened, but it definately imposed on a negative vibe among some
people i know. a bigger problem seemed to be the inconsistency of security
at the door to that main room, which led me no choice to wait in line 40
minutes to hear dieselboy. I wanted so badly to hear jungle, but not while
waiting in line in the cold. They worked security so much better at
Daedalus, i must say.
        moving on to the music, what i really came for:
deiselboy spun some really intelligent jungle, which generated some of that
familiar pittsburgh vibe, too bad i missed half his set. Kimbal Collins had
some of the best buildups i've heard. I'm suprised he didn't rock the house
down. (perhaps it was the fact that the kids weren't peaking yet).Dmitry
has some good records, but he acts as though he made them. i guess when you
have the werd Supa in front of your name things get kinnd foggy up there in
that dome of his. Aside from his ego, i thought he spun way too long.
alright aready, i wanna hear Carlos!! this man is a really kewl cat if you
every get a chance to meet him. He really dug the vibe. And he is so modest
with his skillz!! this 31 year old spins just for the love of it, like an 8
year old with his Legos. He really plays with the crowd and responds to its
vibe as well. He really performs at parties, unlike Dmitry's set which
might as well been played by a cd. (he said he would spin at my party (mi
pinus) for free, but he's got an obligation in ohio, oh well worth a shot!)
                I was at the speakers at four oclock and saw noone that was
a net raver x-ept stickman. it's all good though because we had both
realized we had never ever been to a net meet, and never really desired
to... we both meet a lot of people, so putting order to the proccess of
meeting people makes it boring (at least that's how i feeel; I won't
remember your name if its just a brief transaction that's so ordinary). I
would rather meet all of you naturally, you know?

on that note
                                    i'd like to say

peace

Hey everyone-
	I know that this post is a little late in the day for the 
review...sorry! =z I had to work all day...
	I left for That Thing a little late last night (about 10pm) since 
my car was giving me problems and we (4  of my friends and myself) needed 
to fing an alternate way of getting there...After getting lost a few 
thousand times...we spotted a few other cars full of ravers and we all 
decided to follow each other ( =) hi guys! =) ) we all arrived at the 
Washington Fairgrounds about 12:45am-ish.  I was a little disappointed to 
hear the familair sounds of Dieselboy spinning in the first room 
already...I hate to miss Dieselboy's set!!! I figured no problem...we'll 
get in the door and I'll dance my ass off to the remainder of his set! I 
also was supposed to meet Damian to get my additional copy of East Coast 
Science since my first got snagged (sorry Damian...I'll be in touch about 
that)...I waited in line with Matt(the other Rave Info Compiler), Laura, 
Ann Marie and Matthew to get in the warehouse for at the very least an 
hour and a half...during which time I took numerous numbers of walks up 
toi the front of the line to see what the hold up was...one security 
guard checking everyone? Why couldn't there have been two??? I got a bit 
discouraged after the hour and a half so we took off DISAPPOINTED as 
hell! I know that this was supposed to be a SLAMMIN' party and am upset 
about missin it...I just can't understand what the problem was that they 
only had one security guard...
SHIT...after a summer of parties being busted and being shitty in 
Philadelphia, DC, and NYC I was looking forward to being back at my 
favorite rave site...the fairgrounds...
*sigh* =(-

hi everyone.

this is zerozero bringing to you his version of that thing.
well -- being really young (15) and not wanting to get busted by your
folks for sneaking out of the house sucks. Me and a few friends got
permission to go untill 1am. yeah--it sucks, but we got some free
tickets for  makin the web page, so it was all good. Let me just say that i had a REALLY good time anyways. there were so many people, that it
was just amazing. there were about 150 people, constantly in line just
to buy tickets. there were more people there than at almost any party
i've been to.

the music was just excellent! there was a little problem with the soundsystem in the main room or something, so smoov went on a little late, but
he was bomb! for the sound check, he took two records and had a party
mixing and scratching them. my friend said "man.. that dude has BALLS!"
and you've got to admit, he knew what he was doing, and it was a rather
bold thing to be doing before your set. he kicked in with the slow
breaks, and that made everyone happed. dnb heads, house heads -
everyone.

then dieselboy came on... you could tell it was about to happen because
10% of the people in the space ran up front so they could observe him.
it was incredible. he mixed and mixed and mixed with non stop phat beats. there wasn't a person on the floro who wasn't having a complete blast.
That's when the breakdancing started. everyone basically just formed a
circle around the dancers and let them tear shit up. it was really
dope..

<<[time for the really sad part]>>
anyways,  i looked at my watch and it said 12:55. time to go. so we go
outside and my parents are waiting in a car and they drove us home.
isn't that just a shame? oh well.. better days are not too far in the future, but i missed all of the big acts!  :(

i know this is long as fuck, but hey -- someone wants to read it (i think
:)

--zerozero--

ps -- that really was a nice vibe goin on there.
pps - i didn't even stay late enough for the first netmeet!

Imagine this,

    huge rave, PPG plaza, downtown pittsburgh.  That's the building
plaza made out of glass that looks like a castle.  I can't imagine any
other outdoor place in the world for a rave.  I think it can be done. 
I'm drolling thinking about it.  That thing was all right.  Too much
house.  I hate being sick at a rave.

Perhaps similarlly thinking there are these three really huge connected
warehouses near Homestead
They are the really big REALLY blue ones!
If you are driving by(perhaps to kenny wood) they are so blue its almost
surreal, and they do have a for RENT sign, unfortunatley I dont think they
have Raves in mind

    That Thing would have been a MUCH more smooth party if they had a
smart bar, less cops, tickets checked at the gate rather than the door,
and a second room that was less than half a mile from the first room. 
The line to get in just sucked mi gnutts.

    Howevah:

    The sound and the DJ's in the main room were really pumpin' out some
phat toons.  I got to hear some of DieselBoy's set (real nice...
especially the PUNK...MOTHA...FUCKA track) and was surprised that he
went on so early, but this was definitely not a jungle party.  I was
mucho impressed with (I think) Kimball Collins (if he was the guy who
went on 2 after DieselBoy).  Just as I was leaving, around 4:30am, he
started spinning this track with a real phat acid bassline (for some
reason I imagined it being neon green) and so I just HAD to wait for
that to end.

    There was too much of a house feel to the music, though;  not that I
hate house, but I really can't start slamming until the music gets real
hard.  Oh well.  Why doesn't Bit spin at a rave?  He's got phenomenally
dope hard trance and breakbeat stuff.  It would be a good segway to a
jungle set.  Imagine: Smoov, Bit, DieselBoy - risin' high for 4 or 5
hours straight.  Oh well.

    As for that second room, pretty poor sound, and a little too much
friskin' goin' on.  I even got double-teamed when I started to leave too
quickly.  I think they just wanted to feel people up...

:)
 
1. why a smart bar? smart drinks are such ripoffs...
2. it seemed to me that the cops were pretty harmless...what did they do?
3. the line WAS a bitch...but did you know that there was another door open in 
   back? the line there was 5 people max if there even was a line at
all...they    closed it off after the line up front died down...i went
back and forth         between the two rooms twice in less than 10
minutes...
   (esther mentioned she had a friend that went to the other room and had to   
   wait forever to get back in the main room...is that you?) 
4. i liked the second room...i didn't think it was that far at all...it
was a      two minute walk...tops...there was also this really surreal
effect i noticed    that at a point between the two rooms, the main
room's music totally faded      out and you hear the faintest beats
coming from the second room and you         think to yourself "awwwww
yeah..."...i really like a lot of the music in the    second room...but
there was never that many people in there(at least early      on...dunno
about after 4am)...maybe they should just have set up coffee and    
doughnuts in there again... 

now what REALLY would have made the party better was if the damn oakland
shuttle actually followed the announced schedule...we got there an hour
late because it never showed up at the right time...

you also mentioned bit...is he tom butcher? and is tom butcher that big
blonde haired guy?

i think i can answer some of your questions,
some of which i don't know why you asked:

>1. why a smart bar? smart drinks are such ripoffs...

        some people don't spend their money on drugz you know so they can
afford the luxury of helping cool people out with their business ventures.
I support young energetic and ambitious entrepeneurs. I bought a "412
represent" shirt and made some cool friends at the same time at "that
thing." I've met kids in baltimore who make their own jeans and they were
so phat i had to buy a pair. Venders have their place in the rave scene, if
you don't care for it don't support it, and don't just assume that b/c they
charge something for their service they are greedy and should not be at
events.

>2. it seemed to me that the cops were pretty harmless...what did they do?
they arrested four people, two of which got bailed out by 6am. they
generated bad vibes and had no clue how to run security and keep kids
happy. a lot of kidz went to that party for jungle and missed dieselboy
because they waited in line for  90 minutes.

>3. the line WAS a bitch...but did you know that there was another door open in
>   back? the line there was 5 people max if there even was a line at
>all...they    closed it off after the line up front died down...i went
>back and forth         between the two rooms twice in less than 10
>minutes...
>   (esther mentioned she had a friend that went to the other room and had to
>   wait forever to get back in the main room...is that you?)

that back door wasn't open when it should have been (see above) and
no that people knew about it anyway. They should have used the other
parking lot and other entrance so the only frisking would be done at the
gate and more kids would hang out between the two rooms, like deadulus.

it was a little chilly and agree with Kenneth'd post that you attempted to
flame, so there:)
peace.

uh...it wasn't a flame...it wasn't my intention to start anything...i'm
sorry if it gave the wrong impression...i *did* think my comments might
be taken as snide...so that's why i put the smiley before i began giving
my thoughts...just like i'm putting it on top right now because this

you're that serious since you also put a smiley at the end of your

i do know that since i never do drugs...and i realize some of these
people are cool...but if mother theresa was selling lemonade for $100 a
pop to support lepers...i would still think, "jeez...what a
rip-off...good intentions...but what a rip..."...see? it's not that i
think that they don't belong there...i don't think anyone should be
banned from the event...i never said they didn't belong...my question
was...why is it that...

Excerpts from internet.pb-cle-raves: 16-Sep-96 That Line by Kenneth J

because of the presence of smart drinks...i just didn't realize people
were so into them...sorry...and rip-off was a poor choice of words...it
wasn't meant to imply the sellers were bastards...maybe i should have
said "the price of smart drinks can sometimes be considered pretty steep
when you take production costs into account."

well...i didn't realize that...sorry...but my INNOCENT question
is...what were these guys arrested for? and were they guilty?

well...apologies again...i didn't think the cops were running

folks who were patting people down...i guess that's because the only
cops i saw were just standing around...was the line holdup really the

First of all it wasn't free and it wasn't in Akron, it was at Tappan Lake
about an hour from Akron, and it was $5 to cover the location. It was
still good for a free party. It was outside, so it got kind of chilly
later on, and since the place was so spread out it was hard to judge how
many people were there. There were two areas for music, none of the music
was outstanding, but there wasn't anything bad. The one DJ that stood out
was a guy playing breakbeat at the front area about 8 or 9 in the morning.
Couldn't have looked less like a 'raver', and everytime he did a mix he
started doing some really bizarre funky-ass dance. That made my morning.
That and a trampoline we discovered up the hill from the front area.
I had a pretty good time, but my friends car broke down right outside, and
in the morning I had to take him around looking for a tow truck. A lady at
a gas station we stopped at asked us if we went to that place often, said
they party every other weekend and then asked us if we got really
"toasted"! Then the tow truck guy started talking about how its good the
kids have somewhere to go to party all night...weird town...

I don't know... it just doesn't seem like a rave to me without Cafe
2000.  The guys knew me... they gave me discounts. :(

> 2. it seemed to me that the cops were pretty harmless...what did they do?

Well, they were, at one point, inside the main room, and that's just bad
vibes right off (at least for me) and they were searching the guys
selling tee shirts between the two rooms for no apparent reason.  They
didn't actually do anything bad, but I'm just more comfy in a cop-free
environment.

    Yeah, that was me.  I was under the impression that the back door
was only for the DJ's... but I guess not.  Argh.

    Yes and yes.

    So when's the next big Pittsburgh Par-tay?

My take on the whole thing is this.  First off, I'm mad as hell that the 
line was soo long that half of the crowd didn't get in for Dieselboy's 
set.  I only got to catch the last four or five tracks, which definitely 
wasn't enough 'cause that was it for the Jungle for the entire night! I 
wish I had known that Ruffian wasn't spinning Jungle, 'cause when I first 
bought tix I was saying to myself "Well, there is not enough Jungle, but 
at least two good Jungle DJs will be there".  So much for that...

Second, the Run-Come was too much in force.  I saw three people get 
shaked down and one girl arrested for smoking a bowl.  Yeah, I know, keep 
the drugs outside or well hidden, but in any case it's not nice to see 
someone get busted for any reason.  Security is a necessity just to keep 
order, but the cops out there had nothing better to do than harass the 
crowd.  I saw some undercover lurkers in three different changes of 
clothes.  Like we didn't recognize their faces just because they put on a 
different shirt.  Anyways, the sound in the main room was pretty good and 
I was glad to see some video projection.  Anyone know who the artist 
was?  Supa-Dimitry is funny.  Way too much Diva House, but an interesting 
character to watch in any case.  Well, I guess that's all ... wishing for 
another chance at the Rewind ....

my friend john speakman from nyc wrote this review of the last soundlab
party....thought id share it.. hope u like it...:) 

(hes british btw, so imagine someone who *kinda* sounds like dudley moore 
reading this out loud :)

--------

okay kids, this is nearly two weeks late now... and i feel
another rant coming on about twilo, arena, homophobia etc.,
so let's get on with it.  on the closing night of cmj, i
and a select crew of cmj survivors attended the soundlab party
at the film academy on union square.  the first (small,
a bit uncomfortably hot) room seemed pleasant enough, someone
was spinning mellow ambient vibes, people were hanging out
chatting, cold sapporos were there for the drinking.  i
talked to a few people i wasn't expecting to see (hi jayna!)
and then went to look for the rest of my party in the bigger
room upstairs.

entering the main room i was greeted with the usual barrage of
unlistenable bollocks that seems to constitute "illbient".
awful industrial sounding noises over a meandering quasi-funky
beat. most people there (the ones who'd been before, i guess) were
talking up a storm, yelling to be heard over the noise.  some
were sitting down on their own, stoned off their asses. a lot
were standing around, yawning, drinking fast and wondering what
to do now.  one or two were trying to dance.  the people there
looked kinda cool and interesting, but i got the impression that
the only reason they came was that there were other cool people
there.  kinda like a boho-intellectual dating service.

carrie and i, the unbelievers, the heretics, went back downstairs
to the other room.  now they were playing jungle.  i'm still
not much of a jungle fan, but at least it was music.  we stood
by the fan and i drank my beer in a hurry.  the first room is
like an anteroom, where the unbelievers who want to hear something
recognizably musical go.  when they graduate to full-scale illbient,
they hit the main room.  we realized we'd exhausted our options
as far as things to do were concerned and went back up to say our
goodbyes.  the music was still a terrible discordant racket, but
now someone was juggling burning sticks.  rapturous applause greeted
the end of her performance, one that wouldn't have merited any kind
of response at all if it were at a circus.  to my surprise, the rest
of our party were like "yeah, it's crap, let's go".

peace,

i've got an idea (finally) about making the areas closer together for
these outside parties: putting them back to back. although this
wouldn't really work that well with more than 2. but if somebody did
this, everyone wouldn't have to hike back + forth so far, + all the
power could be put together (<--is this advantageous? i don't know
anything about power + sound systems). if they are back to back they 
can be closer without a conflict of sound because the sound would be 
going in opposite directions. i hate having to walk really far to get 
to the other place just to see if the music there is better. most of 
the time at outdoor parties the djs just go on whenever anyway because
everybody's late + there's traffic + construction + the place is so 
hard to find; so it's impossible to find out when + where the djs u
like come on. 

> The one DJ that stood out
> was a guy playing breakbeat at the front area about 8 or 9 in the morning.

damn i missed that! me + my friend left at about 7 because we were so
tired (well this was her 1st party, so it was probably kind of a lot
for the 1st time) + the music for the past couple of hrs had been this
hard minimal stuff which wasn't very interesting. i wanted to hear
something a lot funkier at that hr so i could dance + stay awake. i
fell asleep a lot of times that nite usually next to the campfire but
also even standing up in the cold. i was really glad to hear "rockit"
by herbie hancock, i just bought that record last week + played it,
but it's hard to find time to dance to something while you're mixing
it (and not very well! yes i need practice...). also i heard 2 other 
records that i'm wondering if anyone knows what they are because i 
want to get them.
#1: there's this guy saying "acid funk" a lot + "we don't need no 303"
+ "it's not about techno noise, (something) girls and boys"
#2: doesn't have any lyrics. it's trance or something + has this part
that's like      
                           (for those of u that can read music)
      
  __           |=  |-    |==|   |
 |  |   |     o'  o'    o' o'  o'
o' o'  o'   (1/16 
(1/8  (1/4   note)
notes) note)

which always comes in at a weird time + catches me offguard when i'm
dancing, but it's so cool that it's ok.

anyway i'd say that party was pretty good overall + i met so many
people too.

I've been kicking this idea around for a while now:

What about the Buyer's Mart warehouse downtown?  Nobody I've asked knows 
if it's even used anymore.  Might have some kibo possibilities..

No, Buyer's Mart is not used anymore, but I don't know who owns it.  I'm
sure some homeless people live there, maybe some rats, but it'd be a
totally rad place for a big party, with a little (maybe a lot) cleaning.

Get legal permission...??  A renegade break in...?? hmmmm.  I'll see if
there's even a # on it next time I'm downtown.

Hey Everyone,

If you're in Cleveland and are going to Covert tonight, make sure you say
hi.  I'll be there in blue jeans and a shirt with thin blue and white
horizontal stripes.  I have brown hair and probably look 22 or 23 even
though I'm a little older.  I'll be with my friend Margaret who has
blondish orangish hair (she's 5'4" and I'm 6'0").  I'd love to finally
meet some net ravers.  The location is Euclid and 73rd in some club (I
think it's called the Coliseum).  Call Spontaneous for directions. 

Take care and hope to see you there.

Braden

It might be worth the time to track down the owners, if inded there are 
any.  Didn't Buyer's Mart go out of business 23 years ago (for 
sufficiently small values of 23)?

It would be worth the work, though.  I think Gibson put it best for one 
other thing, though...

"Well??  Let's get the power up!"

Possibilities.  A renegade there, though...  that would be T3.  It would 
be worth all the trouble to get it put together.

> there's even a # on it next time I'm downtown.

If you could do that when next you're in towne, that would be great.  I'd 
do so as well, but I'm a little out of the way at the moment...

Hey Y'all,

	My friend Lissa from "In Pittsburgh" asked me to post something to
the list about their music guide that is coming out next week.  She said
that any DJ's or musicians who would like their contact info listed could
send her an e-mail and she'll include them in the paper next week.  Her
addy is: 

Lissa Brennan - brennan@inpgh.com

She'd like a contact name, 
DJ name,
style you spin,
and any other brief words you'd like to describe what you do.

o.k., I guess that's it.

bye,
Toby

To all,
	I was just sent the following message and I was
absolutely pissed. This is communism and I won't have it.
Everybody needs to heed the following warning so they can't

a chain letter. It is NOT a scam (from me, anyway). Read on.

Sorry for the repost but, the email addy in the previous post was incorrect
the correct addy is pimentoed@aol.com

thanks in advance!

MTV's electronic music show entitled AMP has already run twice and has
aired video's from Autechre , Afex Twin , FSOL , Chemical Bros. and others.
The producers of the show are thinking of making this a regular weekly
thing  from 2-3 am on Saturdays. I have obtained the shows producers e-mail
address and would like to encourage everyone who whould like to see this
show continue to e-mail the producer at pimentoed@aol.com and encourage
them to keep AMP on the air.

People, please stop posting shit like this.  Do not believe everything you
hear or read.  Try to learn the facts first, before passing along trash
(like what is quoted at the end of this message).  Lexis-Nexis is not
putting out personal information, no more than could be gained from buying
one of those "Phone-Disc" Phonebook CD-ROMS.

*throws arms up in air in disgust*

READ THE NEWSWEEK ARTICLE BELOW FOR THE TRUTH.  I HAVE THE MAGAZINE IN
FRONT OF ME NOW, AND I JUST FINISHED TYPING IT OUT FOR ALL OF YOU TO
READ!!! SO READ IT, DAMMIT!!!

If I had a nickel for everytime someone believed a chain letter...

FROM _NEWSWEEK_ MAGAZINE 09/23/96
"Cyberscope"
page 14

Internet:
NOT SO PERSONAL

	When LEXIS-NEXIS in June started a new service called P-TRAK, a
database of about 300 million records of personal information, it wasn't
prepared for the Internet tumult that followed.  In chat channels,
newsgroups and e-mail, false rumors that it contains *really* personal
information--like your credit history, mother's maiden name, Social
Security card number--spread like gossip in a small town.  "Shoe size and
tobacco brand, too," jokes a spokesman.  Lexis-Nexis has been flooded by
callers tipped off on the Net wanting their names removed.  Turns out that
P-TRAK has scarcely more than a phone-book listing (date of birth and a
previous address may turn up).

I think on this(ne-raves) list we already got this, but the copy you
forwarded has been edited, note the mention of an 800 number
but no 800 number listed...
in the previous message, the phone number which has been deleted,
was:

(800)543-6862

they may have since disconnected it, i dunno. perhaps it was starting
to cost them too much.  perhaps one of the managers cleverly edited
it and recirculated the message to try and save his company some money.
i would try the 800 # first, to sockitooem for creating such an idiotic
database. wtf would be the use of mother's maiden name in a database,
other than for impersonation and fraud? and soc security #, what good
is that for marketing?

last thing, this is NOT communism.  it is CAPITALISM at work.
somebody is attempting to make money off this, and it ain't the
government.

"I'm all lost in the supermarket...I can no longer shop happily..I came in
here for a special offer...a guaranteed personality..." (old clash tune)

you could do soooo much with a spuermarket theme.  Crazy fruity and fruity
drinks and oversized kitchen tools and big old fluffy mops that you could
snuggle in  ... and all the net ravers could wear aprons instead of
badges.  and they'd allow roller blading in the aisles.  what a raver
supermarket look like?  (I think I've had this conversation before...)

Phat idea, if you can get rid of that stench of 4 day old produce and air
conditioning..  :)

Parties on wheels are always fun- I wore big fat rollerskates to a
Seattle party this summer and it just rocked the house (but your feet do
get a little tired...). I think the only thing that need be said is
roller disco.
Everyone would have to wear their "Trips are for kids", "marajuana- over
1 million served" etc. gear.

Nothing that a little nag champa wouldn't cure (well, a lot, actually)

If y'all have this, I _will_ be there (although sans-rollerskates, since
they're back home on the west coast)

No, Freee was in a shopping mall.  One of those enclosed strip mall kind 
of things out in Monroeville.  Man, that party was such a blast, I'd love 
to go to another Rave there, I wonder if it's still available?

Hey Rich. First of all MTV is for people who don't know a fucking thing
@ the progressive vein of true techno, ie. Bitches with no knowledge of
true beats or rythym. PissTV is not interested in expanding the minds of
the techno illiterate; it deals more with making viewwers know what to
wear, how to act, who's got the best acne medicine, etc. True "rave"
music (rave being the word that frat boys and little runny nosed girls
use to describe techno) has nothing to do with the garbage that MTV's
CRAMPED broadcasts. If you're into the MAcarena or Marky Mark and the
Funky Lunch then by all means view on valiant warrior. However, if you
ever hope to understand the reality of the music, go out and support
real DJ's in your area and listen to what they have to offer. I assure
you that the music they play is where its really at. Don't you get it
Rich? Techno is an underground thing; and it will be until the guerilla
forces of the Electro Nation tear down the walls resurrected by
corporations (hell/bent on making a buck by promoting half/ass
entertainment) and idiots who will listen to anything that someone else
tells them is cutting edge electronic music. 

        How did you get on my fucking mailing list you twit?

COMMUNITY VS. COMMODITY

	the 'rave' scene is a community : defined by the music we listen
	to and the events we attend.  techno is a music : defined by the
	fact that it is created in a computer, and it has a danceable beat.

	epMTyV is not concerned with community.  they take the underground
	(whatever underground has the most profit at any given time) and
	sell it - it is a commodity.  when a scene is co-opted by the 
	major media you find your community a lot bigger - flooded
	by people that get the half-assed eMpTyV "hook," that don't care
	about the scene.. don't care about OUR scene, created in OUR
	image with OUR IDEALS.

	we are crowded out of our community.  it is suddenly a big, lonely
	place.

	if you think that the impersonal megabuck$ of Dave Geffen Co. are
	all that you need to revitalize a dying scene, look at the punk
	scene here, or the rave scene in england.

	think that we're somehow different?

	think again

no it's not.. both the sunshine kids, udg and aleph have tried and the 
owner refuses to let go of it (now that he knows what a 'rave' is!)

1) The post about MTV's AMP was posted to several mailing lists.

2) Techno has become more popular, some claim for the wrong reasons, but IMHO
except for the commercialized crap, it won't EVER be popular, at least over in
the U.S. Rare is the tune without words that gets played on the radio. 

3) MTV's support of the underground scene (AMP containing lots of nice ambient
tunes) is better than total ignorance. It will, if anything else, encourage more
of those youngsters to turn off MTV's all-commercial channel and explore some
real reason.

4) When the scene was actually underground, it didn't have elitists like you
making derogatory comments to a seemingly innocent commercial affair. Personally,
I see the PLUR concept of raves, such an important part of it in many cases
before, being overridden by a scene where chemical substances are emphasized and
elitism is in (sounds WAY too much like what happened to the hippies, IMHO). Not
as fun anymore.

Yo G-Shock--

Maybe you don't get it.  The show's on from 2-3 on Saturday nights.  It's
not about mainstream prime time exposure.  The guy who's putting the show
together is trying to put something of substance on the airwaves.  Why do
you think the head brass at MTV gave him the Saturday 2-3 slot because they
think they're going to sell alot of advertising--HELL NO.

Yet, perhaps  you might get a chance to see a few videos/hear a few cuts
from new artists if you get home from a club on a Saturday night that you
might not hear/discover otherwise.

Why not have an outlet for these artists and videos.  Open your mind--and
unlike you I won't bother calling you names...if you haven't figured it out
that's not what this scenes supposed to be about.  And I do agree with you
that it's important to support our local scenes...

>Oh please...  The future of music is techno and other "electronic music."Better get used to it buddy...


Here in the good ol' U.S. of A. techno music and the scene that follows
it, will always be the underdog to such artists as Greenday,
or the next gansta rapper that hasn't been knocked off yet.  When was
the last time you walked in to Hastings and had the new Autechre disc in
the new release section? Americans don't want Autechre or Plastik Man or
anything similar, they want to know why Curt Cobain killed himself
before he put out another Nirvana cd...
   Most Americans don't have the passion, or the mental capacity to want
to know and understand a scene so diversified from the "norm".
I mean, how many of us have been at a club or rave or something, and
have the drunken jock stumble in from the bars, and start haggling the
women?  Do you think he is there for the music? Do you think he is there
for the scene? NOPE! He's there lookin' for a 2nd course kegger,
with a piece of ass for dessert.  If it's not AC/DC blairing through the
speakers, he doesn't care to listen, he doesn't need to though, cause he
can just hop in his jacked up 4x4 cruise to the local music store and
have the newest release readily available, with no special ordering
necessary...WELCOME TO AMERICA.

                this is quite easily the most intelligent post i have read
on the subject...this is exactly what i do NOT want to have happen...i dont
consider airtime on mtv "respect"...im not an elitist either...but i think
it is good for our scene when ppl dont have it handed to them on a silver
platter...when they have to BUY the music to hear it...when the have to go
to raves/parties/whatever to dance to it...

if any of you ever saw flux, you wouldnt even waste your text arguing

Respect on that point, Master 412.  You sound like a student of the Noam
Chompsky school of Dance Music :-) The point is very well taken ... If
eMpTyV has anything to do with our scene, no matter what time slot or who
the "guest VJ" will be, there will be a loss of control that we have
previously had over *our scene*.  It doesn't matter what the initial
intentions are, if mass media tests the waters with a 3am slot, and it
does well, the commercial investors in eMpTyV will see $ and the slot will
be changed to a better time, and that will be the end of it. It may be 
inevitable that the U.S. Rave culture becomes commercialized like it did 
in England, but we can try to fight it for as long as possible.

Ho Hum.

Are we getting back to that boring old argument about hiding our music so
we don't have to share with people who aren't as cool and underground as we
are?

No person or group owns a form of music.  Rather, we should take pleasure
in its celebration: amongst ourselves and when new listeners are also able
to enjoy it. Sharing music you love is a positive experience. Making rules
and regulating it's listenership is not.

The real joke is most DJs who have been involved in the "underground" over
a period of time (including Rich, who helped establish the West Coast scene
over ten years ago) realise that our power lies in our ability to change
the way people think.

Many people who become DJs or whom are involved in our scene want to share
music and believe in its power to heal, whereas those who use music as an
elitist source of power against others seem to miss the point. Ultimately,
we should feel very sorry for people who politicize music to the extent
that they feel angered by others enjoyment of it.

For God's sake, do an E and chill out !!!

Cheers

yoiks! when you have BUY the music to hear it, when you have to go to
raves/parties whatever to dance to it?

man, rave culture is already an upper middle class consumerist
phenomenon.  when half the new good releases are on import only $10 a
pop, when half the parties are these $20+ events, when people blow
more than that on a fix for the night.  what a way to build an
EXclusive community.

i actually welcome the commoditization of this business, and don't
tell me it isn't a business when you consider the amounts of $$$
getting tossed around.  maybe texas is different, but in certainly in
the NE it already is business, even if run largely by sometimes flaky
individuals.

anyway, by commoditization it'll get rid of the posers who are only in
it because they gotta be cooler than everybody else, and once
everybody else is doing it there's no point anymore and they'll move
on to _whatever_.

sure it'll introduce a whole new crop of new posers, but at least
it'll be a different set of posers.  and some of those new posers
might not really be posers after all.

yeah you'll have to sort through more crap to get to the genuine
stuff, but you want all the gems handed to you on a platter?  the
diamonds are still out there, and will still be out there, music and
peoplewise.  here's a pickaxe.  stop complainin and start digging.

Ok kids - here's my input, at least to the pgh crowd, because that header
was WAY TO HUGE.

First I'd like to say - this is a great debate.  It's interesting to hear
what people think as far as the, dare i say it, inevitable
commercialization of techno/dance/rave/blah.. in the US.  Or at least, a
greater commercialization than we've already gone through (which I think
is alot).

Now some thoughts:

   Is the 'rave-scene' really being commercialized?  I haven't seen 'AMP',
but the artists that I heard were played are not really 'rave-scene'
artists.  They seem to be promoting what I'd call the
'closest-to-commercial' levels of techno - stuff that you can already find
in most NRMs, but not stuff you're likely to hear at a rave.  Now granted,
if the show gains popularity (which, given it's time slot, would only
happen because of sincere interest), it could try to move into more
'underground' artists.  If it REALLY gains popularity, advertisers
might support it, approach promoters to sponsor 'raves', major labels
try to sign our favorite artists or throw their own 'commercial' raves. 
But no artist is going to be played without their permission.  No promoter
is going to accept a sponsor without knowing the reprocussions.  If people
know what's what, nothing can be commercialized unless people WANT it to
be.

  Now I'd also like to say: what's bad about a certain amount of
commercialization.  Everyone's favorite example: the UK - we say
techno/jungle/rave has been commercialized there, but we also envy it at
the same time.  They have tons of good venues, lots of dedicated
ravers/junglists, and scads of incredible producers.  Would they really
have such an enviable situation if things hadn't gotten at least somewhat
commercial?  I can't really answer the question, maybe there'd be no
difference in the quality and quantity of the good music, but I'm inclined
to think otherwise.  

Of course, there are equally valid counterexamples. The Netherlands for
example:  a few years ago Gabberhouse & Rotterdam were the new
underground musics, and they REALLY took off there.  Events were small and
'underground' at one point, but now they're huge and sponsored by big
corporations.  But that's not the worst of it - artists like Paul
Elastik, Charly Lownoise, DJ Rob, etc. actually softened their sound, made
it more 'consumable' so they could sell more records.  While I personally
still like their sounds, I'd think this is exactly what we don't want in
the US.  But as I said before, it's the artist's choice to 'sell-out', and
nothing else.

Ok. This became too long, and a forgot some of my points.  Maybe I'll
think of them later.  But anyway, keep up the debate.  I'm going to go get
a milkshake. :P

l8s,
 geoff

Yes, I heard that *rumor* too - that they'd be at "the Grind's" filming at
the "wonderful" Club Stratus.  Of course it is on toga night, and the shortest 
skirts get free drinks.....so you know I'm there!

it seems sort of ironic that a dj for a radio station is advocating the
noncomercialism of our scene. i believe in the inevitability of the growth
of our scene into mainstream culture for a veery good reason:

         "any subculture that is cultivated with an image that is
attractive such as ours will eventually establish a social heirarchy very
similar to the culture in which we all tried to escape...."
                                                        -quothe me.

and i think it already has... our vibes are too fresh to keep underground;
the desire for fame and popularity is something very prevelant in the rave
scene...
it's also human nature so accept it

    Roller skating raves are a blast.  I went to one three years ago in
Dallas put on by the good vibe tribe and had a great time.  People
skated and they played disco untill about 2 or 3 then they stopped the
skating and turned the skating rink into a dance floor and played house
and breaks the rest of the night.
    I highly recommend a roller party to any promoter out there.  The
only problem that I can see is if a bunch of cheesy roller bladers
showed up.

Later,
Johnny

Ho Hum.
     
Are we getting back to that boring old argument about hiding our music so 
we don't have to share with people who aren't as cool and underground as we 
are?
     
No person or group owns a form of music.  Rather, we should take pleasure 
in its celebration: amongst ourselves and when new listeners are also able 
to enjoy it. Sharing music you love is a positive experience. Making rules 
and regulating it's listenership is not.
     
The real joke is most DJs who have been involved in the "underground" over 
a period of time (including Rich, who helped establish the West Coast scene 
over ten years ago) realise that our power lies in our ability to change 
the way people think.
     
Many people who become DJs or whom are involved in our scene want to share 
music and believe in its power to heal, whereas those who use music as an 
elitist source of power against others seem to miss the point. Ultimately, 
we should feel very sorry for people who politicize music to the extent 
that they feel angered by others enjoyment of it.
     
For God's sake, do an E and chill out !!!

People can be given clues, I certainly have received my fair share over
the 
years. A *VIABLE* community absorbs those "new" people and then teaches
them
how to become good members of the community. A dead or dying community
ignores
and ostrisizes them. ameriKa, as a community, is being killed by TV. How
many
ravers do you know by sight? How many people where you live do you know
by
sight? How many of the first would you go out of your way to help? How
many
of the second? PLUR is just some nice words, it is the foundation by
which a
community can be built which the rest of ameriKa has forgotten. Take the 
half-assed and hit them with a load of PLUR and they will become people
who
care so fast it will make your head spin!

It is only lonely if *you* fill it with a bunch of *thems*. The word
prejudice
comes to mind.

The lesson from england is that clubs don't work if they depend on
alcohol for 
their revenue and sex to get people in the door. I haven't been to an
"over 21"
club in 13 years for just that reason.

>         think that we're somehow different?

Yes, I do. And so far that difference is proving to be stronger than the
trends
supposed to tame it. That has got those who see peace as dangerous very
scared.
They have started busting raves on the least little infraction and there
is
a special "rave task force" trying to shut them down altogether. 

(Hi guys, try not to enjoy yourselves or respect our quite upright and
moral 
lifestyle, well except for those EvIlE Drugz (tm) which we find to be
quite 
sacred in the real sense of the word. The Romans had equal luck with the 
Christians, back when that word meant something.)

Personally, I think MTV's AMP is a great idea for the US.
The ChillOut Zone has been on MTV Europe for some time now late Sat. nights!
IMHO, A great program mix of techno ambient etc.
I think that programs like AMP will have great spinoff effects like helping
to support those poeple in the visual industries who do the
videos/animations/multimedia for techno artists.
Techno/rave has been commercial forever, so lets see MTV go into the future!
The BUZZ bin is getting a little repetitive latley.

While some people may think that it is best to keep this "sub-culture" 
all to ourselves, we have to remember that in order for it to survive, 
it has to grow, and therefore the MTV thing might be a welcome addition 
to our happy little communitiy.  At the same time, too much exposure can 
hurt anything... there is too much of a good thing, and it usually comes 
about from giving people so much of it that they want to puke.  I have to 
admit that when I see someone goin' around with some phresh adidas gear 
listening to Hootie and the Blowfish, I am a bit upset at their taking a 
certain aspect of my style that I once held with my tight-net group of 
friends, but I feel that we must leave ourselves open to others entering 
our world of music, style, and attitude for all those people who will 
contribute to the scene in the future...  I would hate to see a talented 
musician or DJ spat on at a rave because they were wearing a KISS shirt, 
and because of some ass (who is probably one of those Hootie followers) I 
won't be able to expand my mind through someone elses thoughts.


that's all I have to say about that, Jennay!

absolutely not. i try to expose as many people as a can to the best music 
i can find, <best in my opinion, of course, with input from ears i trust>
as often as i can, and as loud as i can. the difference i see, though, is 
like comparing <insert major label cheesetrackhere> to something made 
with soul, and spirit, because the artist wants to whether or not it 
causes the artist to go broke in the proccess. music has to be made for 
its own sake, for the sake of telling its own story. i worry though that 
empty-vee will distort the vision, as has happened over and over again, 
and people will miss the point. so we do need to expose the underground 
as fully and as brightly as possible to get the message across. but not 
through mass media spin control. i think it's best done one friend at a 
time. then your friends friends, etc.

seriously. it is stressful to find huge media conglomerations eyeing your 
self-created lifestyle like rabid dogs, but we don't need infighting and 
elitism. i always like a dj that will share a track name with me. music 
is technically info, and information needs to be free. 
 
anyways, my .02 cents.

Don't worry, this isn't a spam.  This is an important message.  It is
important to me, to you and to the world.  It is not a product of any
organized religion or established organization..  This is a message of
hope, of love and of change.  This email was sent to  you because you
are an important person who can bring about change.

In this message I use the some terms loosely.   God, Goodness and
Positivity Energy can be and are one in the same.  The same applies to
evil, satan and negative energy.  These are merely words that cannot
truly describe the entities and feelings at hand.  When reading this
essay, please do not restrict your perceptive thinking to the limits
of my particular vocabulary.

NEGATIVITY IS NOT RACIST, NEGATIVITY USES RACISM AND OPPRESSION

Not all whites are negative and not all elites are negative.  The
negativity in this world lives in those who use their power, their
money, and their followings to advance their own selfish goals while
oppressing others.  The negative in this world lives in those who
accept  "their way" as the "only way"  These characteristics transcend
all races of this planet.  Although I am not culturally Anglo, I am
considered white by modern day standards.  My culture was the
oppressor of nations 2,000 years ago, and a victim of bourgeoisie
oppression 100 years ago.  I bring this up to point out that
oppression can be inflicted by any "race" or culture and endured by
any "race" or culture.    It is easy for some to paint a stereotypical
picture of white skinned people as a wicked and greedy ruling class.
It is also easy for some to paint a stereotypical picture of dark
skinned people as drug dealers, gang members, thieves and murderers.
We are all humans and negativity does not have a preferred group of
people for it's existence.

NEGATIVITY IS NOT SPIRITUAL, NEGATIVITY USES SPIRITUAL DIVISIONS AND
ORGANIZATIONS

In my search for spiritual answers, I have studied Buddhism,
Christianity and  Judaism.   I know only a little bit about the works
of Islam but I respect it as a work of God, being a work of  God it is
something that I must learn.  I apologize for my ignorance on this
matter.  To be honest, I see all of these major religions as a work of
God.  Each following holds a belief in the spirit, in the soul, in the
afterlife, in the goodness of humankind, in peace and in love.  These
are powerful feelings and ideas that cannot be captivated by words.
Subsequently they cannot be bottled or sold either. To find peace, to
find love, to find happiness one must first learn to love and respect
others.

 Sadly enough, negativity has penetrated most of our modern day
 established religions.  I am sure that we can agree most religions
 are founded on the work of god but they have also been corrupted by
 the work of human beings.  It is my personal belief that many of
 today's organized religions have been corrupted by their pursuit of
 money and power.   Many organized religions have been corrupted
 because they judge anyone who does not partake in their particular
 following. One must judge themselves; only God can pass judgment on
 others.

NEGATIVITY IS SELFISHNESS

It appears that many of today's societies and individuals focus their
primary concern towards material gains and selfish goals.  What about
making people happy?  What making people feel special?  Helping each
other?  Helping the planet?  Many of us would rather see people suffer
if it meant saving a tax dollar, we would rather seek vengeance than
helping a wrong-doer see the light. 

The pursuits of money, power, and fame are not the keys to a
fulfilling life.   However, they maybe become products or utilities of
a happy life if used in a positive manner.   The only concern that
many of us show for the spirit is following a group of established
rules and our own selfish concern about where we for an afterlife!
Even our spiritual concerns are selfish!! Many of us are already dead
because our souls have not been given a chance to live!   

Remember, when we leave this planet, we leave with nothing!   So where
do power, wealth and fame come into this picture?  It currently does
not, unless it's used to help humanity!  I am sure even atheists could
agree on this.   How can humankind ever truly progress when we are
only concern ourselves with what happens to ourselves versus
concerning ourselves with what happens to each other?  The truth is
that everything is inter-connected -- and in the case of selfishness
it's just a negative circle!   Remember - evolution spelled backwards
is No I tu Love.  There is no I to love.  There can be no spiritual
evolution through selfishness.   

 Many of us look to God as single entity, as a single being.   It is
 my belief that God can and does exist within us all.  God exists
 through goodness and positive energy.  If we do not manifest these
 tenets within our lives, God cannot exist in us.  Without God our
 eternal souls cannot live.  Without God, our souls will die.  

NEGATIVITY IS GREED, NEGATIVITY IS COMMERCIALISM

Some of us are fortunate enough to be financially secure, but many
still want more..  How can people amass millions of dollars while
letting their brothers and sisters (humans) live in poverty, hunger
and despair?   Living comfortably is one thing, but living in greed is
another.  Money = selfishness.    Unfortunately, these negative things
are a major product of the society that we live in;  for now it is
impossible for many of us to survive without partaking in these
lustful pursuits.    

Look at what money does to people.  Look at what we do for it?  We
spend most of our lives chasing the dollar that we never seem to have
enough of -- is that the real reason we are here on this planet?
Humankind does so many wicked things to itself for money, power and
fame but where does that get us?  Does it elevate our spirits?   No,
it makes us use each other and it makes lie to each other.  Our lust
for material prosperity destroys friendships and ruins families.  What
do people go to college for these days?  Is it to gain intellectual
knowledge, a better understanding of things?  Most would respond "To
get a good paying job!"    As for jobs - do our careers really satisfy
our lives or do they just pay our bills?  Is life only meant to be
lived for money?  

We are constantly battered with commercials telling us to "buy buy
buy,"  "spend spend spend."  We are convinced that we need all these
new  technological gadgets to be happy, but do they really make us
happy?    When Sears Roebuck produced his (their) first catalogue,
their  biggest obstacle was convincing self-sufficient Americans that
they needed Sears products.   

NEGATIVITY IS LUST FOR POWER

Governments around the world have founded their powers on man's greed.
 The notion that the structure of an economic system is irrelevant to
a government.  Just like used car salesmen, Governments have used
utopian promises of to buy their powers. Promises of economic
prosperity have been made through ideologies such as capitalism,
socialism, communism.  Moral promises have been made with establishing
state religions and legislating morality.  The list of empty promises
can go on forever, but the point is this:  These promises have all
been made in the same manner that a fisherman uses his bait to catch
fish.  A good government should not operate to maintain it's own power
and interests;  a good government should function in the interests of
humankind and this planet. 

MANY OF US ARE BLIND

I would rather consider myself a humanitarian, instead of someone who
agrees with a particular side on a political issue.  My only concern
here is life and humanity.  Hurting and destroying the lives of others
DOES NOT lead to solutions of problems.  I wonder when our world
leaders will start to understand that.  Judging by our recent
international history of turbulence, it's obvious that many of the
world's "leaders" still do not understand the concept of peace.

For example, I would like to examine the United States recent
involvement in Iraq.  This whole incident scares me.  I am fearful of
the day that Islamic nations unite and rise up against the western
world.  The United States has been called by many Islamic leaders "the
great white devil oppressor."  Is this what the United States wants?
What will more hostilities equate to? More bombings? More lives lost?
Sure Mr. Sadamm Hussein may be an oppressive leader, but Iraq belongs
to Iraq.  Iraq should be able to do what it wants to do, not what the
United States wants it to do.  If Mr. Sadamm Hussein is truly doing
evil, he should / will be judged by his people and by God, not by the
United States. Are the United States' actions towards Iraq a form of
international dictatorship?  Does murdering people  (no matter what
their offense) provide a solution to political,  diplomatic or even
humanitarian problems?  

I spent a little time reading periodicals (unbiased by US interests)
that convey the Arab nations' perceptions of the United States.  Think
of the feelings that are provoked when a Jewish person sees a Nazi
flag.  Many citizens of the Arab nations feel the same way when they
set eyes upon the US flag.   I am  not attempting to "slam" anyone
here; I just see these events as a thumbnail to a more dangerous
problem.  These events are like the ticking of a time bomb waiting to
explode. You have a group of people who are angry, a group of people
who are being bombed and starved "for peace" by a nation that exists
on the other side of the planet.  

There is a lot that we could have learned from the Israeli / PLO
talks.   Diplomats from both sides of the conflict set aside their
personal  biases and lusts for vengeance, while recognizing a dire
need for negotiations that would lead to peace.   Maybe the US just
needs someone to pick  on now that the Soviets are no longer around.
Calls to nationalism have always won support for failing governments.

 Many American's have already forgotten the recent disputes with China
 over Chinese military actions near Taiwan.  We were told how the
 Chinese were using their military to conduct aggressions against
 Taiwan and we were told that the United States was sending a naval
 fleet to the area to "preserve the peace."   What Americans were not
 told was that Chinese officials made a PUBLIC STATEMENT that failed
 to make it's way into the United States borders.  This statement
 decreed that any United States military actions would be responded to
 with a Chinese nuclear strike on Los Angeles.  Is that what the
 United States wants?  More bloodshed?

Maybe we can predict an outcome with this question:  Are politicians
going to do what is right or are politicians going to base their
decisions on what their approval ratings dictate?    

POSITIVE CHANGE IS IN WITHIN OUR GRASP

We already know that violence will NEVER solve anything, but
unfortunately many Americans citizens and politicians think violence
is the answer.   The world needs a revolution of peace and love - a
revolution that wont sell out to the beliefs of the economic elites.
We need a revolution that will cross all barriers of religion,
ideology and cultural differences.  We are all have souls.  God can
live in all of us.  We are all God's children.  People of the world
need to wake up and start seeing ANY human being as a brother or
sister, as an extended family member.

Governments have been very successful at slowing human progress
through the hindrance of free thought.  Education is the hardest to
obtain for the most oppressed in societies, in many cases Education is
structured to restrict your free thought processes.  In nations around
the world, people are constantly bombarded with propaganda in the
"news," television shows and movies.  This biased propaganda is being
used to control the public's ideologies, beliefs and thinking - people
are being "brainwashed" here! Before there can ever be a successful
humanitarian progress in this world, it's residents must undo this
form of brainwashing.  We must accept reality for what it is, not the
painted pictures that our oppressors attempt dish out to us.  It is
time to lift the our proverbial veils.

Many people feel that they have no control of government or society
and that things are better left in "Big Brother's" hands.  Every time
we look towards a government to solve our problems, we sell away a bit
of our lives.  We have to reverse our fatalist attitudes and take
charge!   We can manifest our own waves of destiny if we work at doing
so.  Why let external situations control our destinies for us?  This
effort should not be restricted to America or your particular nation,
this effort should be made worldwide!  

Negativity even makes it's way into our ideologies.  Many people feel
suffocated and scared once they lose their blindness to this
oppression. Negativity, evil or Satan will always prevail when people
turn to violence for a solution.  We have been taught through
"history" and "justice systems" that violence and vengeance will
resolve conflicts.  This cannot be further from the truth.  Violence
and vengeance make revolution impossible.  People will refuse to
accept or learn new ideologies if they are being served along with
anger, death, destruction and mayhem.   In the current state of
society that we live in, any revolution must be a revolution of peace.
  Anger, negativity, terrorism and violence will only hinder
progressive revolutionary movements.   

We as humankind need an awakening, an economic evolution, a spiritual
evolution and a psychological evolution.  Humankind needs a Global
Evolution, not revolution; we need a conscious development that can
lead to an elevation of the mind, body and the soul. Many around the
world,  such as yourself, already know this and are acting upon it. 

The first step to make this evolution work is to stop accepting
everything around you at face value.  Do not take narrow minded "Right
vs. Wrong" perspectives on issues   Eliminate yourself of all
perspectives so you can see the issues more clearly.  Do not take
existing of positions on political or ideological stances; create your
own perspectives based upon all of the available data.  Become
formless so you can assume all forms. Once a clear picture is
obtained, seize the moment and spread the word. Spread the word of
positivity!  Do not wait for things to happen -- one must make things
happen themselves.  Do not wait for a leader -- one must lead
themselves.  If someone can lead you to a Mecca, they can also lead
you right out of it.   

Blind yourself from negativity.  Be aware of  negativity while
eliminating it from your life. Manifest positivity in  your beliefs,
interactions and thinking.  Even in physics, negative particles
eliminate positive particles.  One cannot fight negativity; one must
shield themselves from it.  

ONE MUST BE FORMLESS SO THAT THEY CAN ASSUME ALL FORMS

In closing, the way of the Tao teaches that one must be formless so
that they can assume all forms.  This can apply to our careers, our
education and thinking  even our spiritual destinies.  Being formless
means eliminating blinding perspectives so that one can take positive
aspects of all related issues   Please take the time to reread this
essay with that idea in hand.   

Peace, Love, Unity and Respect.

Proud member of the rave movement.  Although we are underground and
secretive, we are not a small group of teenagers who abuse drugs as
the media attempts to portray us.  We exist world wide - in  North and
South America, in Europe, in Russia, in Africa, in India, in East
Asia, ect. One distinguishing characteristic that is true of us is
that we dance and we all dance to a common music.  In a spiritual
sense, many of us feel that we can achieve spiritual strength and
unification through dance and music. This belief is very similar to
the practices of the Ancient Sumerians, Tribal Africans, Aborigines
and Native Americans.

Weren't we all taught at one time or another about the rave scene? 
Or did we all just create this life we live on our own?  
Weren't we all brought into the scene by someone else who perhaps showed
up around, told us what was up, introduced us to others?
Aren't we all part of a movement?
And don't movements need followers?
And how, when some drop out of the scene, can the movement keep on?

Just some thoughts...

i'm not sorry for perpetuation of this conversation
i think its cool that we can express our true opinions
and the only image to judge are the characters on the screen:)

Movement [noun]<moov-ment>

The only movement we are unified in
is the movement of the speakers and
the way it makes us move.
We follow the movements of others
as other follow ours.
We help each other.
We live with each other.
We don't have a movement;
We have a culture.

Revolution [noun]<rev-a-loo-shun>

The only revolutions we are unified in
are the revolutions of the turntables
Who are we against???
the government???
the police???
for what justified reason???
justified by who???
what constitutes justified???

Education [noun]<ej-U-K-shun>

People learn what they want to learn
People preach what they want to preach
there is no rave textbook
it isn't a class
just be happy our scene accepts
intelligence, clarity, and progress

Commercialism [noun]<cu-mersh-ul-izm>

some of us can't live underground
some of us need a spotlight;
there is greed and there is glamour
there is fame and there is fortune.
C'est la vie mes amies;
deal with it.

look what happened to alternative music.
that doesn't mean our whole scene is fucked.
there will alwayz be an underground
there is respect for the DL.
But we can't all be a part of it...

What is unity then?
Unity is a state of mind
Unity is beauty
Unity is good
Unity is not a gathering
Unity is not a movement
Unity is not a culture...

we are here we are there
then *poof* we are gone...
isn't that reason enough to party?

What the hell is this?  Whiny fucking DJ's bitching about everything?
Let's knock frat boys, and white middle class, and 13 year olds and
everybody else that doesn't have funky dreads and hang out in your
personal clique.  Sounds like the goths whining about people starting to
like goth.  And the NINies whining that Trent was COOL before everybody
ELSE listened.  And the industrial people on RMI moaning that KMFDM is on
90210, and NOW all the preppy MIDDLE CLASS people are listening to KMFDM.
And how, now that Thrill Kill Kult (plug) was on the Crow soundtrack,
everybody is buying all the TKK cd's, cause they're "posers".

Oh no!  "Our scene isn't going to be "underground" any more." Uncool
NORMAL people are entering our once private domain.  MTV is trying to
homogonize our "scene" and take it mainstream.

Are there any GROWNUPS on this list (or attached lists?) Fucking grow up. 

I subbed to listen to the DJ's talk about what music is cool, so I can
become familiar with it when I hear it.  I subbed so I can learn more
about this music.  I SUBBED, so I can know where the next PARTY is going
to be at, and so I will know if there is a place I can dance all night to
the kind of music I like.  

This is starting to sound like Usenet.

Subject: Stupid moronic postings about MTV's AMP show
Date: Sat, 21 Sep 1996 05:12:05 -0700
From: Greg Earle <earle@isolar.Tujunga.CA.US>
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I have a very simple question for all you knee-jerk posters about AMP (or,
more to the point, MTV, since AMP seems to have gotten lost in the equation).

HAVE YOU OR HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THE "AMP" PROGRAM IN QUESTION?

If not, then politely SHUT THE FUCK UP.

God, if there's anything worse than post-adolescent whining about how MTV's
going to take away "our" music - without having *watched the goddamn program* -
I don't know what is.

For those of you who still need to pick up the white courtesy cluephone:

MTV has aired two episodes (well, OK, one episode; once repeated) of "AMP".
The program was an hour long and featured videos by

	Sun Electric
	The Aphex Twin ("On")
	Spacetime Continuum ("Kairo")
	Ken Ishii ("Extra")
	Autechre ("Second Bad Vilbel")
	Future Sound of London ("Amoeba")
	Underworld ("Pearls Girl" and "Cowgirl")
	Chemical Brothers ("Life is Sweet")
	Orbital ("The Box")
	Tricky

Now the Tricky video really didn't fit (although it was certainly better than
all the crap videos in the idiotic "Music Video Awards" show that preceded AMP)
and the Chem Bros. isn't the greatest, but all the rest of these videos were 
utterly fab and done by some of the world's finest purveyors of intelligent
dance music.  Probably one of the greatest hours of television I've ever
watched; certainly the greatest hour of something called "MTV" I've ever seen.
(I for one had only seen "Life Is Sweet" and "The Box" once; I'd never seen
any of the others)

Yet here we are a week or so later, and just because Rich Sihilling says "Hey,
I found the producers' e-mail address, you should all encourage them", all the
knee-jerk twits (oh dear, I've lost PLUR points) have to crawl out of the
woodwork to condemn something that was utterly magnificent *just because the
videotape has a logo that looked like "MTV" on it once in a while*.  PATHETIC.

Now, do I like the fact that (both times) it was put on at 3 AM, local time?
Heck no.  That tells me that MTV's programming people decided to marginalize
it.  And they should rightly be condemned for that.  But otherwise, how on
EARTH could you say something bad about the videos that AMP showed?  Or worse,
how could you get on a soapbox and prattle on about how bad & evil MTV is, and
how they'll destroy "our" music, when you haven't even seen the damned show?!?
Sheesh.


Finally, let me end with two snippets from some local SoCal-raves posts
(these were actually *good* ones, I'm just quoting to serve my point):

> You know.  It's an odd thing when something you really like and have put a
> lot of time into suddenly becomes the next fad.

and

> Excellent point!  Why do we assume that "THEY" are so powerful that they can
> just snatch from us at whim this world we have created?

These are about Techno music and mainstream assimilation; let's turn them on
their head a little.  How about we turn that "odd thing [that] something you
really like and have put a lot of time into" into the Internet?  If you're
one of the whiners about MTV, are you on a Mac or a PC and have you used the
'Net for less than 3 years?  If so, then how are you any different from the
MTV chattel you rant and rave about?

Or in regards to the latter quote, what do you think those of us who've been
on the Internet for 10 years or more, and who've been on the Web since its
infancy, using the same UNIX boxes that built the 'Net and the Web into what
it is today, think about when we see idiotic headlines like "Gates or
Netscape - who will WIN the WEB WAR?"  (or "Gates or Netscape - who will
CONTROL the INTERNET?").  Gee, when last I checked, Internet Explorer didn't
run on the vast majority of the computer platforms of the world (i.e., still
not on the Mac yet, and definitely not on *any* UNIX platform), yet magazines
proudly trumpet Gates' coming to take control of the 'Net and the Web.  Now
re-read that "Why do we assume that ``THEY'' are so powerful that they can
just snatch from us at whim this world we have created" and substitute
"Microsoft" for "THEY".

True, I'm a DJ on a radio station, but the station is non-commercial.  I 
have a non-commercial license with the FCC.  That means that no one 
decides what I'm to spin except for me and my crew in the studio.  No 
Nike ads to fuck up my mix, no catering to sponsors or other such 
intrusions which may be necessary for other formats.  I'm not saying that 
a Jungle show on WAMO wouldn't be cool, 'cause it's a broader audience 
and all, but I'd much rather have people discover my selections on 'PTS 
or Free Radio Pittsburgh, where I know it took some effort to find the 
show, than would otherwise happen on a commercial outlet like MTV where 
the vibes are pre-packaged and fed to us by corporate giants like 
Viacom!

Master 412 and I were discussing this very idea ... it seems from some 
posts that the thought of commercial succes brings a larger audience, 
which is good for expanding the family and increasing our numbers, etc. 
but to me that sounds utopian and unlikely.  The most likely thing to 
evolve from more exposure is less consistency and more trash to wade 
through to get to the good fruit.

Posturing does little for the scene, although it is inevitable as you 
point out, however I'd like to keep things as underground as possible, 
whether through Pirate radio, renegade parties, dub plates, or whatever.

After receieving some responses to my last message, I think I need to 
explain what I meant without all the fancy jargon.

All I was trying to say in my last message was that this country, and 
this world would be a better place if  was more love in peoples 
action, more good will towards others.   This includes involvement 
aimed at ending racism, involvement in getting people to vote.  We 
could even end poverty suffering with more acts of charity to humanitarian 
organizations.  Ect..ect..ect..

What you mean is that only the most glamed out fucks will survive. Those
who enjoy the music now will have to move on.  It will no longer be raw
(and therefor gloriously underground) when Aerosmith and Wink put out a
single together. (This is an example, you tweakers.)  Didnt hip hop used
to be underground at one point.  Like say in the early 1980's, hip hop was
still not a mainstream thing.  Now what has happened to the music.  Has it
gone anywhere.  Who gets the props (Coolio, Snoop Dog, and the now late
2Pac... that's who.) And who here gives two shits about those cats?  

And house music has taken to the mainstream long ago.  Starting with
who... maybe C&C music factory.  Old euro techno faced the same fate.
Jungle will be the next victim of over hype (or has it already?)

If you want a new thing, then why dont you all create it and stop the

I was a speed demon when I was 8.  I have a pair of skates.  I'd wear 'em.
I almost wore them waitressing one time, but I'd left them back home on
the _east_ coast.  

Yeah, I'd rave on skates ( for a while).

 Tea's on _college_ radio, silly!  He andhis partners in crime play all
the newest and best from
places where the palm trees grow and places where it rains all the time.
(dancehall and junglejugnlejungle) for peole who don't like FM east of the
noncommercial band.  His show's the buttahs.  And he makes other
contributions...lots...  
damn, trippin over your feet on the way to making your point.

i know it's late but hopefully these'll do somebody some good...the 
spankline was late in posting these to their line so dont look at me ;)

from the N take 71 or 75 S through cincy, to kentucky, and look for rt 236
(ERLANGER exit, #184) about a mile past 275.  take a R at the light and
then another R at the next light onto DONALDSON RD.  the space is located
right there next to the howard johnson's. 

from the S follow as above but obviously take 71/75 N to exit 184 and go 
L there, presumably.

doors open at 12mid but there's no word on price!!  bummer!  by my 
calculations it ought not to cost more than $15 or thereabouts.

i wont be makin the netmeet but those of you who know me say hi and 
introduce me to the fellow pooter geeks, please.

my parents woudn't let me have eMpTyV cuz they thought i'd worship the
devil and eats bats on stage

so in you's all's opinion, what effect/influence did 120 mintues have on
da alternascene?  good bad indiff no effect???

I don't now how helpful comparisons of Euro scenes and this one are b/c
the factors at work are so different; general public's taste in music,
importance of identity and classificiation and alignment with a look or
scene in boht places, how the media works, how big business is run, and
how we respond to it.  I'm no expert, but i think any of those factors is
enough to skew the picture a little.  all together they amke for quite a
different outcome.

be entertained.  If mtv doesn't entertain you, turn it off.

i cc'd this to pb-cle, my home turf, cuz i want to see if people think my
ideas aobut the hip hop scene are on target.

um, you made a point about hip hop and what i understood that you said was
the mainstream people are making all the shit and the real underground
doesn't care. hip hop's
a different thing altogether.  what's hot on the radio, on mtv, on all the
corporate channels, is still what moves a crowd of real headz.  saw kid
capri last night.  he rocked the house with all the popular jams plus go
go, reggae, old skool flavas.  many of the big names _are_ the shit. 

all i'm saying is yeah, there's got to be tons of great underground hip
hop (unfortunately i personally don't have the means to get a hold of it)
but from what i udnerstand, hip hop works totally differnt from otehr
"undergrounds".  being cutting edge means getting the phat tracks before
anybody else.  phat tracks by ppl like positive k, de la, Nas, cypress.
personally, i don't like west coast.  i think a lot of it has fallen
victim to commercialism in that heads foudn out there's money to be made
by exploiting their own exploitation.  Hence, moneygrubbing and bad music.
not all of it of course.

according to my grand theory on life, the world, and everything, the east
coast has stayed realer and will continue and maybe this has soemthing to
do with the mixtape culture.   the for real underground.  where they spin
the biggest tracks. Positive K, de la, Nas, Cypress. Etc.

Maybe i'm totally off on this...hip hop isn't my specialty.  (in fact i
don't have one)  opinions? corrections? clarifications?

staying wiht my folks for the time being..can you tell by my volume of
posts that i'm starved for the company of thinking humans of my age and
social demographic?

once again re: mainstream or whatever, the "underground" is just fine for
city kids who have access to it, but what about all of us who grew up in
the boonies, listening to top 40s b/c that's all we knew there was? To
reach people out there (and i met a lot of kids at pitt who grew up in the
same situation i did..yeah, i come from bumblefuck, pa. really? me too)
you either need a touch of the good stuff via mainstream to at least
inspire, to spark some interest, an older sibling with half a clue (i
took my little sister to her first all ages show and now she's throwing
them--they call her suzypalooza), or enormous luck.

i'm infatuated wiht the idea of underground.  but can you blame the
clueless fo rnot finding what they don't know to look for?

love and some straw to chaw on,
country bumpkin

<Bryce stands up, claps his hands over his ears, and roars his anger and 
confusion into the vortices of the net>

"Techno on MTV?!  Noo!"
"Why not?  It's the artists choice."
Very true.  If wiz music can be spread to the masses, so be it.  Maybe it 
will help change things for the better on Gaia.  I'm all for seeing 
non-ravers take PLUR mind, body, and soul into themselves.  At the risk 
of sounding like an elitist, if techno ever does manage to become 
mainstream, which I don't think it will:  lots are hung up on lyrics, 
there's still the joy of saying "We were here first."  The Armstrong (??) 
Effect.

"Commercial rave???"
I have to agree there.  Commercializing rave would be a Bad Thing, 
IMHO, in that those that only come to get wasted would flock to them.  
Personally, I like things the way thery are now.  Maybe it's just because 
I like to have something quiet to run off to when I need a break from 
Deep Reality, maybe it's the espressos I drank earlier, maybe I need to 
get a hell of a lot of sleep.  However, I've seen clubs take this same 
route:  people who don't come for the vibe banish it.

Now, I'm not saying that we should have a council fnord of "true ravers" 
judge who is "cool enough" to be allowed into the scene, far from it.  I 
just think that current methods of advertising are enough.  Those who get 
into the scene by someone telling them about it or seeing a flyer, fine.  
I just don't want to see people who start trouble and get flatlined 
showing up.  brain dump:  I don't want to be afraid to walk up to someone 
and start talking for fear of being told to go to hell (I like to think 
that I left all that garbage behind when I graduated from high school, 
lotsa bad experiences)

For me, a rave is a place where I can reach another plane of thought, and 
transcend Deep Reality for a while.  A place where I can comfortably 
forget all the times I've heard the words, "What the fuck are YOU looking 
at??"

I think I'll keep rambling for a bit..

<Bryce stops and thinks for a sec..  the flush leaves his face leaving 
his normal pale features>

Naaahhh..  I just want to see things stay the way they are.  For once in 
my life, I'd like to be a part of something that isn't going to change.

Ok, so I'm an idealist.  The scene is going to change, wheather (how the 
smeg do you spell that, anyway??  :) I want it to or not, so I'll have to 
a) get home more often, and b) deal with it.  It's worked for lots of 
lifetimes, it'll work in this one.

Where the hell was I going with this?  I don't remember.  I'm going to bed...

Sounds a little like what Trap Vector did a while back.

I would, but I have the safety of others to worry about when I wear 
skates.  :)

Yes yes... and Opus, Rick and I will be up in front wearing 412 Represent 
shirts just sitting at the edge of the stage and posing like Liam

Perhaps the best thing to come outta this whole conversation is the fact
that we're reading it all over the US (and then some...).  THAT's pretty
decent unity...

As for the whole keep it underground thing - last night, I made a failed
attempt at getting into Return to the Source at the Liberty Science Center
in New Jersey...  I hope to God no one who drove up to NY/NJ from outta
state got stuck outside...  We waited for an hour outside, moving ten feet
and getting herded like cattle by the security...  After being told to "get
off the landscaping" we headed back into the city...  I don't need that
shit and neither did like, 1000 other people...

Where am I going with this?  I have no idea - it's 9am, I've had an hour
and a half of uh, sleep sorta, and I'm here in the fucking office on Sunday
morning while people set up a network...  God am i bored - and god do I
have too much time to think...  And god, my mind is still reeling from the
emotional overload this weekend (and that party favor I got around to last
night...).

I wonder where we're getting all this "keep it underground" bullshit?  Last
night, there musta been AT LEAST 3000 people going to this thing, from all
over the Northeast...  For some reason, when I think "underground" it
doesn't include a crowd of 3000 in mainstream (or mainstreamed) fashion - I
felt so weird in my funky downtown New Yorky style clothes since the kids
(god did I feel old, made a comment about wishing I was 19 again and the
Nautica-garbed girl next to me, who was very sweet btw, thanks for the
blunt) said, "Gosh, I'm only 19 and I'd give anything to be 17 again..."),
lack of sparkly make-up, and shit, my sneakers were not crazy-ass white
cross trainers of some sort...  3000 people in a science center?  With a
small poster-sized flyer????  THAT'S UNDERGROUND????  I don't get it.

Anyway, we left, went back to the city, and went to Shelter.  Our options
were basically Shelter or Twilo...  Did we wanna deal with guido-central or
beefcake central?  Guido central it was - but ya know, except for the
titty-dancer on the speakers, what a great crowd it ended up being...  The
shelter isn't exactly on the "cool" list of things to do here anymore, but
you won't find a vibier, louder dance floor anywhere else...  It's been a
long time since I've heard good ole house music, not subgenred
hard/progressive/this kind/that kind of house, but plain ole screaming diva
marching house...  AND - good god y'all, the people threw down...  There
were screams, claps, choruses, and people singing their own lyrics...  OLD
SKOOL gay black house queens makin' everyone WORK!  Friendly dance circles
(yes, there IS a such thing) of guys clapping for each other and stuff...
People were wearing something other than Adidas/Nautica/Hilfiger...  Very
few people on too much special K...  Nice, New York style ethnic blend...
As well, they make it very hard at the Shelter to SIT DOWN.  You pretty
much HAVE to dance, not like too many people there looked forced to...

So anyway, it didn't seem like too many people there were worried about the
state of the "scene."  They were most definitely into the music - some of
them, I'm sure, had been going to the Shelter for YEARS...  The love of the
music was readily apparent...

My point is, these debates are great and all, but do we make too much ado
about nothing at all???  Maybe I have a twisted perception on the rest of
the world - things are different here, could be - I have plenty of friends
who like d'n'b as much as they like house...  Not a whole lot seems to be
"underground" here too long...  But once in a while, you get these little
gems where the status of the music and what you have on, etc. doesn't seem
to matter...  And after being treated like SHIT at a party that you never
ended up getting into anyway, (and later meet someone in the bathroom at
Shelter who waited three hours, finally got to the door and was turned
away, and left, all after paying $28 for that bullshit) what do you think
of then?

It's obvious that we are not going to have any sort of separatist, rave
utopia going on...  When it comes down to it, it's PURELY the love of the
music and what it does to you, how it makes you feel, how it makes you
move...  The best thing to do, IMFHO (I like that, whoever came up with it)
is to stop worrying about it.  There's already enough shit in the "scene"
but there are still people out there who love the music passionately and
know what it's all about.  They may not look like you, go to the same
places, or wear the same clothes, or even speak the same language for that
matter, but as I've said before, the unity is in the beats...

Sorry for that outburst - you know how it goes when you've been up a while...

Here is another idea for anyone interested in being politically 
or socially active:  

Set up a web site with a position statement and an online
questionnaire that has to do with a particular topic.  (Ie: Peace in 
the Middle East.) Positive statements of affirmation to
humanitarian / ecological organizations are a good idea too.

The online questionnaire can be a series of  Yes/No "Do you agree with
this?" type questions.   At the bottom of the form, have a space where
someone can place their e-mail address "signature"  in support of the
project's statement. 

Use a CGI script to compile this data into a statistical survey results sheet, 
and atatch all the email addresses to the bottom of the results sheet.

Compile an email list of the various organizations and agencies that
should hear and see the particular message.   (This stuff is pretty
easy to find through places like www.yahoo.com) 

Post the position statement and web site address on newsgroups and
email lists that you think would be interested in the topic.

THEN, when you've collected enough of everything, email away.

The majority of the work would be in getting the web site set up,
after that the internet will work for you.

Not that I mind talking to people from around the country and around the
world, but please stop this insane crossposting! Does anybody realize how
many hundreds of people get these messages? Every post I get from this
thread has more lists added to the cc: box. It's getting to be like some
sort of insane chain letter. We've already sucked England (uk-dance) into
this, and well...

Stop the insanity!

Again, for those hundreds of you out there who already know how to edit
your cc: lists, I'm sorry for adding yet another message to your box.

I really am suprised I am jumping in on this subject, but I thought I would
put my $.02 in. Any underground scene that exists as long as this one has
and has grown to the level that we are at will get more & more
commercialized. that is why the underground always changes. There will
always be the "next thing" or the "next level". That is why thing run in
cycles. I think most of us listened to something before house. My guess is
that we almost all listened to a less commercial version of alternative
music. I didn't switch to house because alternative became commercial. I
liked underground dance music (newbeat,techno, etc) the entire time I have
known of it's existance. I was exposed to it & became part of the scene
because of how it affected me. Most everyone was introduced to the scene.
Now the scene is supposed to stop taking members? Or just not let anyone in
who was exposed by this new video show, Amp? Everyone is screaming now that
MTV has a show. I haven't seen AMP. I do want to. I am glad that I might be
able to see a FSOL video ANYWHERE! Maybe someone who thinks the Macerena (or
however you spell that garbage) is cool will understand just how cheesy it
is and what they could discover by opening their minds & ears. Maybe you
don't think they are cool now. You weren't always cool either. Enjoy this
show while it is on in the middle of the night. It probably is going to come
on in the daylight hours soon enough. It is OK....... the underground will
still be there. You might have to dig a little deeper, maybe it will be a
little different. I'm sorry to say this, but that's the way it works. MTV
did not commercialize house by putting AMP on. Remember when mixed tapes
didn't have glossy covers. Remember before there were labels like
Astralwerks & Moonshine & Smile & COA putting out mixed Cd's. Commercial
mixed Cd's by Scott Henry, Kimball Collins, Taylor, and Sasha & John
Digweed. Do you think these Cd's are not commercial? MTV is adding AMP
because we bought those CD's. Soundscan told them that. It is going to
happen more & more. Just let it happen , and stay true to what the scene is.
Not the drugs. The scene is the music, and the friendships, and the dancing.
PLUR in our own words. But someone is always selling something, whether it's
Ahhs, firestone , the Edge, Simon's , Buzz, Underground Record Source, Now
Hear This!, Vinyl frontier, Watts, Moonshine, promoters, DJ's, Bartenders,
pushers, records stores, Adidas, tribal gear, clothing stores, clubs. Our
scene is a business. It doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. it doesn't mean
that Kimball or Taylor sold out because they put out a CD on a label. It
means the scene has grown. It's not going away or getting smaller, so we
have to expect this. Enjoy AMP while it's in this stage, underground. The
song listing is at least that. I myself look forward to seeing it. If I
mentioned you in this rambling, I must say I fully respect you. I listed you
just because you are succesful and broke new ground, and changed  the way
things are. 

I do a mix show (Open House) on a commercial station (WPLA Jacksonville
florida) and i feel if I expose new people to the scene, then the scene can
grow. This is basically the same thing we are fighting about. I do get paid
to do the show, but would the show be better on a pirate staion where less
people can hear it? And is it not respectful to be on commercial radio? I
play underground music, make my own play list, do my own mix, and expose
brand new music to people every week. i think this is a good thing. Don't
you agree? I say the artist title & label of every cut, so the artist can
sell more records or discs. That way they can continue to record. (oh &
shameless plug time... Record labels....please add me to your list if I am
not on it. Playlists avail upon request). 

Oh well. just my very humble opinion.

Howdy!

Got into work this early Monday am, wondering what I was going to find 
out about the ongoing "democratic" process in Bosnia, wondering if the a 
visit to Northern Ireland by a US congressman could really make any      
difference in *their* peace process... and then I found I had over 50 
messages about a cable television show.

Go figure.

At the last minute Saturday night, brewed a fresh pot of coffee, made 
some calls, picked up the one mission-goer that could join me on such 
short notice, and headed down to Bristol, CT for "HORTICULTURE". the 
space was nice, but hot! (Though I must admit, there is always something 
about a mass of sweaty heaving bodies that adds to the atmosphere, though  
I know the heat can lead to some dangerous health problems.) I found the 
soccer carpet easy enough to dance on, though I know that was a serious 
problem to overcome for some. The sound, nice. The music, (IMHO) ROCKIN'! 
The lights, very nice. The crowd, dancing, smiling, and friendly! (I made 
three new friends, wooHOO!)

Unfortunately, the event ended earlier than anticipated (though not as 
early as was demanded by outside forces!) Kudos to Chris for dealing 
effectively with the complaintant and the local law enforcement agencies. 
(It was entirely out of his hands, but he didn't do the all-too-famous 
dissappearing act; instead he got on the mic, and told the crowd what 
was what. Way to go! Reminds me of the ol' days... heheh)

In general, I danced like an idiot (so I could blend in), saw more 
friends than I thought I would, and had a great time. Yah.

How was Return To The Source?... and some of the other events?

Mike

First of all, I just want to say that I've gotten a lot of mail  regarding
my "Community vs. Commodity" posts and a lot of mail concerning the topic
in general and I appreciate anybody who takes time out to drop me a line.

However, lot of people are reading more into what I wrote than is actually
there.  This  has caused a lot of people to "defend" their points of view
against things I've never said, or even worse has lead people to think
that I espouse points of view that I most certainly do not support!

Specifically, people think that I have suggested that our scene should be
xenophobic and should keep out anybody not like ourselves.  How anybody
got this from my 3 or 4 short paragraphs, I'll have no idea.

I guess what I want to do now is make some passing comments regarding  
this thread.

You see, what we've been trying to do here in Pittsburgh is keep things
geared towards the music, let people discover it if they want (and believe
me, they're more than welcome), but keep it at that level:  for the love
of the music.  Whenever you take somebody else's money for something, you
become co-opted by them.  Not that some great music hasn't come out on
major labels, but the focus definately isn't on the artist.

Now, MTV is a pain in the ass, and will continue to be so, but we don't
have to hide underneath this PLUR-ry naivete that says "evreything will be
OK as long as you show Peace, Love Unity and Respect."  Sometimes you also
have to work for what you believe in, stand up for what you are and speak
out against the evils that you see. 

It's so easy to encourage a viable DIY ethic in the rave scene...
DO SOMETHING!  Pirate radio (we have two all-techno stations: Radio
Carson and Free Radio Pittsburgh) , independantly run zines and record
stores and renegade (read= FREE) partys have all become tradition here in
Pittsburgh.  These are grasroots level activitys that have kept the scene
non-elitist and still non-commercial.

well, van.. any show on commercial TV has to have the potential for profit
or else it would never air!  They're just trying to decide how to make the
most money off of it.

> Why not have an outlet for these artists and videos.

Why does MTV -- a station that for the first years of it's existence had a
policy against airing any and all videos by black artists (ask Don Letts
of Big Audio Dynamite, Quincy Jones or Michael Jackson what they had to go
through to get aired on MTV!) which only started airing hip-hop after Def
Jam etc. busted their ass to become succesful -- have to be an outlet for
artists and videos?

The rave scene has a very succesful infrastructure already built for
alternative media outlets.. why should we drop all that for MTV
respectability?

Ian Mackeye of Dischord records [as well as many other labels in many
other ganres] has proven that keeping the money in our own "alternative"
economy (the real music fans and artists -- as opposed to lawyers and
accountants) can, and usually does prove more profitable and beneficial to
the artists in the long run.  The details are too long to go into here,
but I can suggest book and magazine articles to anybody who's interested.

Personally, I would love it if everyone were a raver.  that's not the same
as having a scene watered down for mass consumption.  think on that for a
while.

this argument is one often heard in discussions like this one.  what it
amounts to is:
	"people are too stupid to like our music so it'll never
	 become popular"

this is more elitist and xenophobic than anything i've ever written on the
subject.

MTV is not supporting any underground scene.  they're trying to create
tomorrow's superstars.  they're milking today's underground scene as
tomorrow's next big thing.

I remember when the punk community was at the same level the rave scene is
at now.  I remember when Green Day played in Erie for me and 20 other kids
and after that we all went to McDonalds and got thrown out by the cops.
Now, Green Day is as big as U2 and every kid on Forbes Avenue here in
Oakland has a goofy mowhawk..  why is it that this can't happen to the
rave scene?

I agree with most all you've said here with the exception of these
comments above.  I think what Chad may have been saying is pretty correct.
Many people do NOT want to listen to techno (or whatever you choose to
call what you listen to) after being exposed to it because they "just
can't get into it.  It doesn't have words I can sing along to.  It's all
noise.  How do you listen to this stuff?? It's so repetitive!" (yeah, as
if the same line in a mainstream song isn't just as repetitive. heheh)

As far as the understanding goes...people really seem to have a hard time 
understanding until someone HeLPs them or they hold that PaSSIon already.
Think about all the people each of us have helped "convert" to this thing
we hold so dear to us.  Most didn't understand at first.  The people that
are exposed and LIKE it will stay...most likely we might all want to know
those people anyway. Those that are exposed and say, "Oh god it's that
TechNo shit...turn the channel."  won't be a problem.  Believe it or not,
LIKe it or NOT, many people really like this stuff but they haven't been
exposed to what many of us think of as GooD.  And a lot of these people we
are all bitching about are ALREADY AT PARTIES with FRIENDS who needed a
ride or friends that are into this "scene" as well as others (most of us). 

MtV will always jump on the bandwagon.  Just like promoters will get a 
shitty jungle DJ just because they "have to have jungle.  It's the new
thing!"  (uh, NoT.) There is a HUGE market for this stuff.  Of CourSe mTv
is going to cash in on it.

I have seen MTV2, but not ASP(or whatever it's called).  My dad watched it
with me.  The Prodigy's "Firestarter" came on.  HE liked it.  I didn't.  
He has always liked my music.  "How am I going to know what's new or
'cool' if you aren't around to show me??"  Why wouldn't people LIKE this
music...it makes you moooove...my grandmother for christ's sake will
listen to it and wiggle her toosh.  But I DO think it's BOrING to sit and
WAtCH you know??  IT's not the same as hearing it LoUd over a crazy
system.  SO even if people say, "Oh Wow this shit is SOOO good let's
run out and buy it!"  THey still don't REaLLy understand what we do every
weekend and why it's a huge part of many of our lives.  Yes, we'll get
a lot of, "Oh, what are you listening to??  I heard that on MtV!  Oh
you are going to a rave?  CAn I come?"  THese people are so fun to
observe.  They are innocent and we can mold them...muhahhaha =)AnD YES YES
YES these things will cause problems within the scene, but then the
underground will always be there because MTV won't EVER really know WhAT's
up. UnLeSs we start working there.  Kind of like, "If you want to know
about it, you need to know the truth according to GoD...we will tell you
what's REALLY cool."  

Relax.

Alright, 
        Since the cat is almost out the bag I might as well tell you that
MTV is comming to town and one of the things they are doing while here is
"The Jungle Grind", yes you heard that right. And since Pittsburgh is the
"jungle capital of the USA" it was natural for them to come here. The show
will feature "The Pittsburgh All-Stars" ie: dieselBoy is going to spin,
I'm going to play a track or two live and MC Sphinx, Hossam is going to MC
along with Soy Sos. I'd tell you the details ie: when and where but I have
been sworn to secrecy until just before the taping. (I also heard they
don't want too many "ravers showing up" their MTV Grind dancers.)  Rick
and Opus are involved, they are going to sit on the stage and look hard. 
412 Drunken Master was going to be asked to come up and boogie down until
he made his anti-MTV AMP comments. Sorry Lenny ;)  Alright I've said
enough. Oh yeah look for me in the October issue of  Mixmag USA. The
article is on Jungle in the US.

    Now, are they going to practice dancing to Jungle before the taping?
 It's not exactly an easy thing to adapt to.  It's worth it, no doubt,
but it takes some getting used to.  Oh well, it should be interesting. 
Anyone with cable up for hosting a little par-tay that evening so we can
check it out?  (unless we can go to the actual event - it's been a dream
of mine to be on "The Grind" (formerly something else) since I was 14...)

Precedence: bulk

sad news from penn state....

        i am sorry to inform you that MI PINUS is the party that never
happened. i originally thought bad promotion was why no one ever threw
decent parties up here, but there's a lot more to it than that...

the financial and social demographics of students up here are consistent
and not condusive to a growing rave culture. some of the issues involved
are:
1. ppl up here won't go to alcohol free events especially if it costs money.
2. ppl up here won't go to alcohol free events especially if they have to
organize a ride.
3. ppl up here won't go to alcohol free events. period.
4. half of the 60 some ravers up here wouldn't come b/c they are either:
        a. brainwashed into the mainstream alcoholic lifestyle
        b. skeptical of a rave scene in state college
        c. too busy becoming a burnt out hippie
5. i'm all for the growth of a scene somewhere, but its not going to happen
until someone pumps a lot of money and a lot of drugz up here... sad but
true; theres not enough energetic drug users up here..
6.although it would be interesting to see if it would have turned out, i
don't feel like the one to lose $1000 and fail my classes to answer that
question.

        before you get mad at me, i want you to know this is the wisest
decision i've made in about three weeks. this was a learning experience for
me. I don't care if i have a bad reputation as a promoter, b/c
i finally realized i wasn't meant to be one.

        i tried to start a scene up here at the expense of my own health.
many a night i would spend with visions in my head and than i would sleep
all day; missing my classes. Through this experience though i've picked out
some character conflicts with the business of rave promotion. I am a
dreamer and i make hastey (sp?) decisions. every day is a new dream, with a
new song.  i'm am not a steady person. i alwayz invite change; if you
haven't noticed the insane amount of morphing this party went through...

when it comes down to it, i am not a business man; i am an artist. To
organize a successful party, You have to manipulate people. you have to
meet people you know you don't really want to know. you have to talk a lot
of shit you don't mean. it also helps if your a drug dealer. what the
fuck???

         i'm sick of knowing a lot of ravers and a lot of dj's not that
well; it gets embarrasing when you can't remember people's names when you
know you've met them 4 times.

and then there's the popularity issue.. twas sort of nice to be followed
around by two gorgeous females passing out flyers for my party, but not
worth the pettiness. i never got into that sort of social heirarchy thing
because i grew out of it before i started raving.

personal reason number X: i know i wouldn't have fun at a party i'm
responsible for.

personal reason #(X+1): its my birthday. i want to have fun on my birthday.

personal reason numebr (X+2): i don't feel right hyping things up to what
they're not. empty promises can get people in the door, but what good is it
if you don't keep them happy?

wow!! the saga is at an end. i've satified my curiosity  and jacked up my
phone bill.
sorry to get everyones hopes up. i still love you:)

..man i need a cigarette..


love,
pete sysko

R.I.P. Mi Pinus (three weeks of bullshit)
i haven't given up; i just grew up.
..hope to see you at Uranus..

that reminds me of a guy i know. he was very much into frank zappa and
strange experimental classical music, and not into techno. i tried to
explain to him that the key to understanding techno is not listening for
the notes (which is what he did) and listen for the SOUNDS, because often
in techno the notes stay the same but the sound of the notes modulates. he
never understood, until he went to england and did e at a club, and he
heard winx 'higher state'. at that point he understood :) this is not to
say that one must do drugs to understand techno, but rather that people
tend to close their minds to things that are different than what they're
used to.

it's obvious that mtv will jump on the bandwagon, that's what they're
there for... but that isn't neccesarily a bad thing. from the sounds of
it, the music they were playing on that AMP show is better than some of
the music i hear when i go out :)

well, i don't think techno should be classified purely as dance music.
the reason i love techno is because i think it's the best music out
there, and the more techno music that get played outside parties, the more
good music there will be. i agree that hearing music while you're dancing
to a good dj is the best way, i would much rather have some kid want to go
to a rave because he heard techno on the radio than have him go to a rave
because "it's cool" and "it's okay to do drugs there". 

personnaly, i think that getting more people into the scene isn't going to
make it any worse. having been in the montreal scene from the very
beginning, i can say that it hasn't gotten any worse for getting bigger,
it's always been pretty bad :( that is due to mainly to the politics of
promotion and djing, which suck in ANY scene of more than, say, 20 people.
sure there are promoters who say, hey i can make a lot of money from doing
this, but those promoters have been here from the VERY BEGINNING!!! face
it. much of the 'ols skool' is more responsible for the problems facing
our scene than some 'new jacks' who are discovering the magic that is the
rave scene for the very first time, or some record company exec that
decides to jump into the techno market. it's human nature we're talking
about here, and just because someone is already in the scene and has been
for a long time doesn't make him okay, most of those people are now
selling drugs and wearing tommy fucking hilfiger.

sure, i miss the golden days, when everybody was friends and we hung out
in gangs of 50 or more, but i guess i woke up and realised that these
people were in the scene and hung out together not for a love of music and
dancing, but for the love of getting high and not much else... i look
around at the people i hung out with three years ago and i see a bunch of
loosers with no more motivation and not much future (but i guess that's
just our generation in general).

First of all, this message was much better. For one, it didn't end with "How the
fuck did you get on my mailing list"... <shrug> 

I would agree that MTV is, primarily, a pain in the ass. However, sometimes,
occasionally something slips up at MTV, and you get some good stuff on. Even if
it isn't exactly the best of the crowd, it is a good introduction. MTV's Liquid
Television may not have been the cream of the animation crop, for example, but it
did get me started into seeing other animation festivals, et al. And, there was a
time when MTV rebroadcast British sitcoms like Monty Python, the Young Ones, et
al. 

Commercial radio stations occasionally are the same way... a long time back, a
commercial rock station named 98 Rock started playing a show called The Pit
Saturdays at midnight. This was an all-speed-and-death metal show, back really
before speed metal became overtly popular. It was totally different from the rest
of the radio station... for the first six months at least.

I can see how people are leary of MTV commercializing things... after all, I do
think the MTV commercialization nearly ruined speed metal, taking most of the
life out of it... So there IS a danger of commercialization once you get on MTV.
But...

But it pretty much is true. (: Here's why: 

There have been many alternative scenes to the norm, many go on to become
commercially exploited. But those that are RADICALLY different from the norm
really never become exploited, or take a while to get accepted, at least.

Punk is, actually, one example. It took around 15 years to get that scene
popular, with Green Day. Its underground popularity rose and fell (around the
mid 80s, the scene still existed, but was loosing ground), but until Green Day
broke ground, the punk scene was heavily underground. Some of its derivatives
(hardcore for instance) still are. 

I don't like the punk scene nowadays, because I see them as a bit
xenophobic. The reaction to Green Day was VERY much in this line: To me, they
always are, and have been, a mediocre punk band (MHO). I've seen them TWICE before they
got popular (opening for Bad Religion and NoFX); they were the same as when they
did that stadium tour. Only thing is they were touring stadiums for three times
the cost a ticket of what I payed to see them up close, in a more punk-friendly
environment (hard to mosh with stadium seats). I didn't buy tickets, but it
wasn't because "GREEN DAY SUKS!", it's because it wasn't worth the ultimate added
pains to see a mediocre punk band.

It HAS. Visit Europe for evidence of that... in Amsterdam, all you HEARD was the
Eurotechno stuff. Visit the underground stores and the coffee shops, though, and
you heard something completely different.

Techno HAS gone the way of punk... in that it's splintered. Remember that the
"New Wave" (now Old Wave) music was actually a splintering of punk in a sense...
it became popular, while true punk remained underground. That's what has happened
to the scene in Europe, and will happen to the scene over here IMHO... Eurotechno
will become popular, while the rest remains underground.

True techno just is too difficult for most people to get. Repetitive beats - most
people can't stand that. Fast and highly electronic - another point against. No
words - the final nail in the coffin. While you can market a splinter of it, it's
hard to market real techno... If you don't believe me, take a look at ska, which
also does everything commercially wrong (emphasis on the backbeat, very fast) and
look how underground IT is despite attempts to mass-market it in the early 90s...

MTV might make it so more people go to a rave just to be k00l and do drugs, but
quite frankly, I see all of the anti-rave reports you get on tabloids like Inside
Edition doing more for that than MTV does. Personally, I doubt AMP will last long
on MTV - nothing cool on MTV has. But it might be worth a try, MHO. So those who think
2 Unlimited is the kewlest techno might get a second look.

I guess if you're going to have a party named after your celestial organ,
you should be sure it will happen, 'cause when it doesn't, the
cancellation posts start to sound like castration :-) DOH!!!....

im sick of hearing people talk about why MTV will damage our scene.
i you live on this planet, you have to sell something to survive, no matter
how humble you are.
you can live underground and sell drugz and once you realize this isn't a
good thing, you have to sell something legit; your services or a product.
        As a recording artist, i will have to advertise my product at some
point. MTV is one medium of music retail advertisement, and it isn't that
different than other forms of advertisement, just obviously the most
succesful one when it comes to young people. Magazines, radio, rave flyers,
all have something to sell you. if you don't want to buy it: don't, but
please respect that MTV and all other forms of commercialism INCLUDING rave
promotion are keeping a lot of talented artists and entrepeneurs alive and
productive. its not at your expense if you don't make it your expense. MTV
doesn't pour into your house; you yourself turn it on and watch it.
        I don't understand the lack of respect people get when they
"sell-out." Now adayz, an ambitious artist needs his/her 15 minutes.
popularity/fame is a big part of our scene. we do the same thing with our
dj's. promoters need to do what MTV does, only on a smaller scale:
entertain you and at the same time sell you other people's fame, in return
the dj gets his advertisement and some of that money.
        MTV has done some very respectable things in the past. They risked
their affiliation with Ticketmaster when Kurt Loder informed you they had a
monopoly in the concert market. They throw AIDS benefit shows. FOR GOD
SAKE'S WE ARE THE MTV GENERATION!!  I understand why you wouldn't want to
be a part of it, but unfortuanelty we are. If there was one network that
you were at all influenced by in your life, it was probably MTV.

        I don't bash MTV because its part of who i am. Its like calling
your brother ugly.

        life is image. life is an advertisement. play hard.

    p.s.    this is the last post i'll make on commercialism this time
around. This dicussion won't come to a conclusion or an agreement. we'll
just be sick of talking and reading about it. i'm getting to that point. it
may sound like i was arguing, but i really only defending my point. I know
some people will agree with me and some people won't.
p.l.u.r.

door, some 50 Case students were stranded just outside of the 
 
library, security people wuz keepin everybody from leaving the
     
premises.  then the wind picks up & dust is flying everywhere.

the source of all the flying wind turned out to be this massive

army helicopter attempting to land on severance music hall.  

apparently they were shooting some major hollywood production 

here in town. so if yur coming out the sm:)e / urb tour party

you dj types feel if they said "sorry Diesel no rewinds...we don't want

The selling out of an "ambitious artist" is an interesting choice of
words. It assumes that the ultimate goal for an artist has to be money. I
won't haggle about the definition of art, but I move that there are many
"ambitious artists" for whom financial gain is secondary, and thus for
them "selling out" isn't even an option.

Don't be fooled. Radio and television are not about entertainment, they
are about money. Entertainment is secondary, and is only related at all
due to the fact that entertainment is what gets you to tune in, thus
supplying them with consumer market data, thus giving them the necessary
stats to charge X amount for Y advertising time. If this were not so,
everyone's favorite television show would still be on (for we all know how
altruistic corporate broadcasting is).

MTV is not here to entertain us, they are here to make money. Many of us
would be very entertained to see Jenny McCarthy topless, but the only
reason we won't see that (at least not on MTV; check the Playboy video
catalog for that) is b/c the FCC has set up some guidelines regarding what
can/can't be broadcast.

Actually, for me I'd have to say PBS. Maybe I'm overly nostalgiac, but I'd
rather my children be able to identify Guy Smiley than Jenny McCarthy.

Sounds like you watch an awful lot of television. (The operative word here
being "awful.") I would rather judge myself - and others - by the content
of character than by their TV Guide. As transient as MTV is (whatever
happened to Eric Nies? Julie Brown? wubba wubba wubba!), what kind of
statement does it make about a person who claims MTV is part of their
persona? As an ad minor, I have to congrat the imaging people in MTV's ad
dept. Every major company wishes they had as strong of a relationship with
their consumers!

>         life is image. life is an advertisement. play hard.

This is your philosophy. I tend to subscribe to the more folksie
sentiments, such as James Taylor's: "The secret of life is enjoying the
passing of time." It's not catchy or shallow enough that Nike might want
to use it on a t-shirt, but it works for me.

Not to sound nit-picky or anything, but why do you HAVE to smoke in order
to go to this party? I mean i can see why its restricted to 21 and over,
but restricting it to smokers is pretty ridiculous.

as a matter of fact, one of the world's largest cigarette companies
sponsering a RAVE is a little ridiculous in and of itself, but thats just
my 2 cents...

have fun whoevers going...

Oh YEAH!!!  We've got that all worked out.  We're leaving PGH around 7:30
to 8:00 so we should be there by 9:00 - 9:30, just like last time.  We'll
be bringing the Solid Gold Dancers with us since we feel that MTV and the
Grind is too hip for our tastes.  We tried to get Dany Aillo, but Dance
Fever just wouldn't have us 'cause they thought that Ummm's electro was a
little too funky for their audience, and Count Zero is too far out for 
the rodeo competition.  I'll just be playing some lousy Jungle remixes of 
old Barry White tunes for the Soul Train massive....me and Don go way back.

All a Pixburghers, hold up a ya pum pum, and don' make it drop, seen? 
Newsflash .... The sound of the drum n' bassline a set down Friday night
October 4 on the second floor of 168.  Militant Barry, original roots
selector from the First Class Sound of WPTS-FM will bring some classic
culture music to the masses.  Alongside myself, the Farmer, and some
special guests, 168 will experience a roots explosion of classic tracks
and latest beats never before experienced in the burgh.  So if ya like 
reggae music, dub, and the Jungle style, check out the second floor of 
168 Friday night, starting at 10pm.  Also running that night is the 
Hip-Hop sounds as always, on the top floor.  Tune in to WPTS-FM Sunday 
night at 6pm for more details....

exerpts from what i wrote last week:

>5. i'm all for the growth of a scene somewhere, but its not going to happen
>until someone pumps a lot of money and a lot of drugz up here... sad but
>true; theres not enough energetic drug users up here..

i can't beleive i said this and no one flamed me...so i'll flame myself;
now that i have more perspective on the situation...its not the drugz that
start a scene, more than the love to dance, the love of music, and the love
of people.

the best way to start a scene is to start from within...no hype with out of
town guests, because if your town doesn't have any sort of unity, the
guests may not be welcomed properly...what ive decided to do is start
throwing free parties in peoples basements that really suck with dj's that
really suck and with flyers that really suck....and the cream will rise to
the top.

its definately the most realistic way to start a scene...
the money barrier can only be broken by frugality and humility,
or i can tax everyone that wants to sell drugs at my party :P
(i heard that a certain namless promoter did that this summer [hint: july
26, 1996; pittsburgh];
 its one of few ideas of his that i respect)

thanks again to everyone that supported me anywayz...
*hugz* and *kissez*

hello, i just spotted a flyer with the following info. i've never heard
of the people who are putting this on and nobody is answering the phone
line so any info would help, this event looks pretty good though.

saturday oct 12 'impedance' cleveland ohio
live pas by:

luvdrop-homeslice records uk
herbert-phono uk
witchman-leaf uk

djs:
dj dan
hipp-e
czech
dj lou

then it says this event is an urbin flava production
urbin flava info line 871-6133

I have no idea about this since one of the djs is somebody i know
personally and he has no clue at all

thanks,
john/c

i'm sorry but there's something very unnatural about natural. all
the chicago net ravers have already warned us about their past bad
experiences with vibonauts, ed has already informed us that ele mental
was not asked to be put on the flyer, the other ohio promotors were
not asked either (the most obvious being spawntaneous which was
psychoactive's partner for both 420 and 720 plus they don't even   
have the correct area code for UPS), a few of the chicago dj's  
including terry mullan and paul johnson are not spinning at natural
cuz of their bad experiences with vibonauts. the chocolate factory
dj's have not even recieved their plane tickets yet.

in addition i was just recently informed that ms. troi gray (from 
the natural flyer) is actually a gay black man that most of the old
skool chicago dj's stay away from becuz in '92, he/she threw a party
similar to Ravestock, where only 300 kids showed and to this day,
he/she still owes money to all the dj's that spun that party.

on the other hand, BAM has never left us down, Bruce's system always
delivers (altho i dunno how well it will survive the ohio elements),
and trevor will always be one of my favorite house dj's, and perhaps
some of the evil chicago promotors are trying to make good, i don't
know.

personally i don't see why they can't combine the two partys instead 
of competing, atleast the kids'll be outta the rain...just stevie 
dreamin' that li'l dream again...

Pete,

I wanted to congratulate you for even trying to organize a rave in State
College.  In 1992, I held a rave in Cleveland.  It was one of the first of
its kind in the state (as I know now).  To make a long story short, I lost
over $3,000 dollars because the college kids never made the effort to
leave their comfy nests.  I hand delivered over 10,000 flyers to students
at John Carrol University, Cleveland State, Case Western Reserve, Kent
State, University of Akron, Baldwin Wallace and Cuyahoga Community
College.  I also made radio promos for WUJC (which were played once an
hour for a solid three weeks), put posters all over the city and passed
out additional flyers to young people in Downtown Cleveland and in the
Flats at all the cooler clubs. I spent three months of my life living this
thing -- mainly in a tireless promotional effort -- and lost three grand
for my time and sweat.  Believe me, I understand where you're at. 

When there is no history for a scene to base itself on, it is like pulling
teeth to get people to show up.  The typical college student needs to be
spoon fed entertainment. They don't want to venture out and try something
new. In America, these "young" people would rather sit in their dorm rooms
complaining about how there's no social life on campus than make the
slightest effort to discover something provocative.  Well, at least that
was my experience. 

Unlike me, you were wise enough to see this before having to pay dj's and
leasing costs for the facility.  I rented the lower floor of the Cleveland
Convention Center (the entire thing!).  It could have been a fantastic
party.  The people who went all had a great time.  I'm sure the same would
have been true at your rave.  

So from my perspective -- you did the right thing.  And now, from your
latest post, it appears that you're continuing to do the right thing. 
Starting a scene is thankless, arduous work.  You have to get people to
slowly participate one at a time.  Underground gatherings grow in time to
larger and larger parties.  In time, what was nothing has gathered enough
steam to become a self propelling entity, one that can thrive on the
creative gestures and efforts of many, at least it has in
Cleveland/Akron/Pittsburgh. 

I applaud your efforts at getting up Mi Penis despite the early withdrawal
(pun, intended). I'm sure you'll be able to erect other efforts in no time
-- although measurably small in scope. :) 

Sincerely,

Braden Albert

***** PLUS 8 PRESS RELEASE ****

RE:     RICHIE HAWTIN DJ APPEARANCE at the CAMEL AIR-RAVE in the BAHAMAS


Richie Hawtin will NOT be appearing at the Camel Air-Rave party in the
Bahamas due to problems with the proposed travel itinery.

The main flight paths from points in Canada to Freeport, Bahamas all
connect via Miami.  Because of Richie's ongoing problems with US
Immigration, these flights are unacceptable.  The only alternative route
would take Richie five (5) days to complete this trip.  

As Richie is presently working in the studio on new material, he will
not be able to take the time off to travel five (5) days for one
appearance.

werd kids, in case you missed it the first time

oh, and (oops) the correct terminology is trache, I mis-named the hole due
to a momentarily misleading Seinfeld episode...


<dream>
OK, so I had this dream last night

I was going to the bathroom, standing there naked taking a piss... and in
walks his 90 year old man... he kneels down next to me while I'm peeing, and
I turn to him and start fucking him in his *goiter*.

Yes, goiter sex.>

(For those of yo who don't know what a goiter is, it's that metal hole they
put in your throat if you don't have a voicebox... or something along those
lines)

i was intimately involved in the first two raves in Erie, PA, about three 
years ago (believe it or not), which is a lot more backwards than 
Cleveland or state college, and we lost no money whatsoever.  Now the 
city (yah, sure it's a city) is throwing two room parties, and drawing 
people from pgh, buffalo and cleveland.

the trick is to keep it small and cheap at first... wagering $3000 on a 
first time party in a city is like flushing your money.  you can't blame 
others for your own failures.

i was wondering if someone could help me.  i've been
looking for the dubtribe full-length cd for some time,
and i was wondering if anyone knew of somewhere
from which i could order it.  i have yet to see it at
any record store in my area, and would really really
really like to own it.  if anyone could help me,
i would be eternally grateful.

thanks, and much love... =)

    I totally agree with Goldfinger about the keep it cool and small in
the beginning.  It makes the event easier to organize, cheaper, and more
intimate.  The funny thing is the best times I've had at raves were at
small warehouse parties, not the huge million room/dj events.  Big
events are fun and cool, but the smaller ones are often have a better
vibe and sometimes even better music.  
    Organizing events is fun, but a real pain in the ass.  I threw a
couple events in Dallas a few years ago and it was alot of work.  The
first was small but alot of fun and people had a good time.  The second
one got cancelled because the guy I was renting the place from pulled
out the day before ( I was pissed), The 3rd one was at a huge warehouse
space, but I really goofed on promoting it (but I had some really great
dj's lined up).      There's many ways to keep costs down and still have
a phat rave.  The hard part is knowing where to cut costs and were not
to cut costs.  The most important thing, HAVE GOOD MUSIC.  
    Sorry about the party pete.  Good luck on future events.

- look to yur right & yur there!      
- the address is 3475 ridge rd @ The United Skates of America

FROM THE WEST:

stephen apologizes for any inconveniences this may have caused,
but the owner of the original space backed out this morning for
some unknown reason...hmmm...stephen will be taking him to court tho.

this new space boasts all the perks of the previous space:

- indoor heated venue
- video games
- concession stands
- real bathrooms

plus since it's @ a roller rink:
- u can rent skates & skate around
- locker bins are provided so u can store yur stuff in & not 
  have it stolen
- even smoother dance floor!

welp since nobody has mentioned it yet, howz 'bout a net meet
...2am by the drink stand?

...see yah there...

=================================================================

ack! just my luck, i checked my e-mail to late cuz i wuz busy
yesterday!

and of course being the clueless wonder when it comes to time @
partys, i missed the 2am net meet by 15 minutes!

but i did bump into hossam, stuff, desmond, kevy kev, doug, i think
wynl, scott & kitten (who actually some how brought the dance outta
the ole foggy). btw scott were u able to find kitten a ride back to
buffalo?

---

ok, fluffy stuff aside, i wanna 1st off say my heart goes out to 
the kids that went to Natural, but i guess u can't control nature.

2nd off i wanna say i am really pissed off with myself for listening
to some of the wack rumors that surrounded Natural, but i guess this
is what happens when you've got competing partys...plus when you're
throwing a party in other promotor's cities & list their info #'s w/o
permission...the natives tend to get restless...i dunno

Hi Ken,

The {pb-cle} 'thing' will be there from now on. It was put on by the
hyperreal administrators (at least that's what I've been told) to
distinguish the list that each message is directed to and/or has
originated from. This was done to create less confusion, since some
people are subscribed to more than one list, and recently there have
been some irrelevant crossposts between mail lists.

Hope this is helpful, and will not cause you any problems.

Viktor

I added the {pb-cle} header to the subject lines of the PB-CLE mail so
people who use mail filtering programs could filter pb-cle mail easily.

Seems like there's a lot of interest about dub plates recently... if
anyone's interested, email me, and i'll send you back phone
numbers/addresses/info.

<<<NATURAL REVIEW>>> (caution: kind of a long post)
woohoo. well i can definitely say that at least for me, this party was
worth well more than it's price in "party favors"--if u know what i 
mean (i. e. i paid $25 to get in but got free "party favors" that were
worth probably about $70. don't ask me how i managed this, i don't
even know). as a result i spent a few hrs. of sat. nite physically in 
a car + trying to fall asleep, but mentally flying around outside. 
very interesting experience. so, much thanx to midnight sky + jim from
st. louis, danny + wayne from nashville, kevin from kent, & whoever
had the tank in the camper, if any of u are on here.

lotsa props to bam & vibeonauts for an all-around good party.

this was also 1 of the most adventurous weekends i've ever had. (i've
already told a few people this story) at first i had a ride + we were
supposed to leave fri. morning but it fell thru, then i found another
ride + that fell thru too. so i called everybody i knew but they had
already left. then, out of desperation, & because if i make up my mind
to go to a party, i will go at all costs, i strapped everything that
would fit onto my bike & pinned a sign that said "natural or bust" (!)
+ left on my bike at about 7:45 pm. after riding for 50 miles in 6
hrs. thru rain + darkness + a lot of wind, i fell like i was going to
collapse so i stopped at a gas station for food. i hadn't brought a
map + i thought there were only about 10 miles left but i found out
there that it was more like 40. fortunately i found someone there 
with a car who gave me a ride for the rest of the way.

i finally got there at about 2:30 am. i don't remember most of the
music except for carlos whose set was great as usual. i went to sleep 
later on + i think that's when the 1 tent fell down. when i went up 
there i saw that the welding in the metal frame had actually broken. 
it was probably from the weight of all the rain on top of it. the 
people doing the lights & lasers had left and took the boards with 
them, but there were still people spinning sat. afternoon. so my 
friend midnight sky changed the switches on the strobes + 
trackspotters (i think that's what they're called) so they would run 
on their own + we had lights.

i was dancing to xian's set that nite which was pretty good, but then 
i started losing my balance a lot + not feeling very well so i was 
taken to a car, which was when it seemed like i was flying
around. does anybody know who was spinning in the tent closer to the
entrance 1 + 2 people after xian? i could hear it from inside the
car. when i felt ok enough to get up, i went over to the
untranslateable booth & hung out with blender, jennifer, + jj.

later on i heard justin long spin & sammy from canada (somebody told
me that's who that was) in the other tent. in the morning i was lucky
that i found a ride home with someone. then i went to sleep for about
18 hours! that's about all i can remeber right now.

Yes, its true.  The good folks at nice+smooth audio have finally set
up the official online Digital Poodle & Kinder Atom mailing list / fan
base... this after increased demand for some sort of mailing list as
well as ongoing requests for band / studio information.

What does it all mean ?

Now you can find out the latest updates on the studios releases, our
collaborations, whos playing and where as well as all sorts of other
pertinent dis-information.   You can also pose questions or comments
to the bands, which well have answered in our regular mailouts.

To subscribe, simply hit reply or send e-mail to chrisd@passport.ca
with the word squelch anywhere in the body of the text.

Just so you know.. the first mailing went out on Saturday.  When you
squelch us, we'll be sure to send it off to you.  They will also be
kept at our web site @ http://www.io.org/~virex.

Thanks..

Sorry this had to go to the list, but I don't know who to get in touch
with, or how, or anything... Any help that anyone can give will be
greatly appreciated!!! :) THANKS! -Count Zer0
