Although we all have the right to free speech, and there shouldn't be any
stigma on using the phrase "White Power" just as it's not bad to use "Black
Power" (which seems to be quite accepted and "OK" these days) -- well, now
that I think about it, how about we do away with ALL such phrases and just
say "People Power"? -- it appears these are Neo-Nazis we are dealing with
here, so fuck em all!  There ain't no way you should be defending their
right to free speech, press, religion, or THOUGHT.  Burn em all cause if
they had their way, everyone except the heterosexual blue-eyed blond boys 
would be incinerated or lined-up & shot.

And besides, we have the right to OUR free speech and campaign, and also
the right to cast OUR votes -- so it's not like any one is doing anything 
illegal.  Just passing info, practicing free speech, and voting.  If it 
prevents the newsgroup from being created and "stifles" their freedom of
speech, so be it; let it be known that it was a majority vote that done
it...the democratic system that prevailed...and the Power of the People.

And that is Totally Non-Non-NON-Un-American, dude!

I agree with most of you in that I don't argee with wp crap but I would

	Isn't this covered by that stupid telecommunications bill? I 
mean, if Bubba really expects the nation to take him seriously anymore, 
he can't waffle on his biggest issue during a campaign year can he?

I would assume all of them will be all ages....for the UPS party call
376-1644 and ask somebody...i'd be surprised if it was 18+ but it might
depend on the location.

btw, does anyone know the location?  is it the eagle's nest?

Hey all!
Here's my Q- anybody in the Pgh area know the lowdown on the UPS party on 
March 9, Daydream? Can one aquire advance tickets in Pgh?  Any idea where 
the party will be held?  Me and a friend want to go, as we've never been 
to a non-pgh rave, and the spring break makes it rill easy.  Alas, we 
don't know the Cleveland area very well. We're probably gonna drive, but 
if anybody has vanspace for us, we'd be happy to give you much hugs in 
exchange for transport.  In anycase, any info is appriciated. :P :)

I don't think so.. You can oppose, YES!!!!, but not give them the right to have their own space...then it's NO!!! for me

I feel bad because groups like "rec.music.white-power" exist, but I believe the net should be a place for freedom and expression. I support Cuba on the planes incident, for example. I feel for Cuba's situation. I should be free to express it as one should be free to express what they think. ALSO, I HAVE A RIGHT TO WRITE TO USENET AND VOTE NO FOR THIS RACIAL_BASED GROUP!!! But i think this should not be taken as a purely rascist-anti-rascist issue. IMHO, The jewish people, who I think promoted this thread in many many other lists too, are not less bigoted than the nazi dudes. A black-power group wouldn't also offend me, it's just people who have things in common discussing their ideals. The problem is the propaganda...but this is another issue ;)

I know that they are my enemies, i am latin. But I am their enemy too. Don't think that there aren't rascists in teh rave scene..I MET MANY RACISTS-XENOPHOBIC PEOPLE ON RAVES! but I tend to believe that if they don't have their space too, we won't be living in a democratic country... Guess what will come next... ban rave newsgroups?? drugs newsgroups??/

sorry about that, but I think that they have the right to have their specific group in which they can discuss the music they like, and not bother groups where people who does not share their thoughts are.

just my opinion..

I would vote no... but, if someone makes alt.music.jewish, alt.music.anti-nazi, rec.music.whatever.. I might just associate it the same way.

SUDDEN IMPULSE - Balletmet Columbus - 3/1/95 - Columbus, Ohio
-------------------------------------------------------------

YUP PRE-PARTY B.S.

so james, carol, & myself headed down to the heart of ohio once
again this time for something completely different...an actual
techno ballet. welp since carol didn't get off work 'til 6pm,
we got to columbus kinda late. alls i can say is $5 dollars for 
parking! geesh & i thought cleveland parking wuz expensive,
maybe i just picked the most expensive place to park or something.
welp since we were late already, we decided to hit a Subway
nearby to grab a bite to eat since Carol hadn't eaten dinner
yet. it wuz by pure luck that when we came out of Subway, we
bumped into Jonathan & Steve aka DJ Animate & DJ Sense, who just
spun at Superfly (and who were spinning the afterhours for Sudden
Impulse at Leslie's pad). it turned out they were late cuz they
had to work too. so the four of us (james didn't come cuz he
didn't have a ticket plus his girl, anne, wuz pickin him up to
go to her birthday party in athens - ZODIAC) headed in.

STEVIE DOING MORE OF THAT NAME DROPPIN THANG

we finally arrived in the Capitol Theatre (it took us awhile to
actually find the damn place) at 9pm, right during intermission.
people were coming out to go to the bathrooms & to chat. lo &
behold we bump into stephen hindman aka Kingsize & his female
friend. we asked what we had missed. he said we really didn't
miss much since the earlier acts were more classical & the
later acts are the more modern techno-lized acts. and later on
when we bumped into leslie, the one who wuz promoting it, she
confirmed it. but she said we missed the one interesting act
that had the players in suits - sort of a yuppy gets loose thing.

AS PROMISED - SHIRT & TIE

oh yeah, as promised, Star*, i showed up in my business attire:
white collar shirt, silk tie, & black cords (Fresh Jive of course!).
u may say i cheated a li'l since most people there were dressed up
- it wuz a ballet in a major theatre, but most of the rave kids
there were in their baggies or typical informal attire (cough,
jonathan, cough, steven, cough, titonton, cough, ed, i better
stop coughing before my throat gets to sore!). so i think a few
kids were kinda surprised to see me in my shirt & tie, but not
nearly as surprised as i wuz to see leidra (columbus fly girl
suprema) in an evening gown - wow (with a tan too!)! she even
dressed up her roomy, dave the breaker from nyc (but of course
he kept the baggys & the sneaks). ok i'll shut up about the 
fashion now, but just wanted to point out i kept my promise.

GEE STEVIE, WHY DON'T U TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL SHOW NOW

1st off i wanna thank leslie for the balcony seats, they were
wonderful. and it allowed us a perfect view of the entire theatre.
if u've never been to the Capitol Theatre for a show before, by
all means go. 'grandiose' does not even describe the beauty of it all.  
altho riding up & down those escalators certainly reminded me
of the columbus convention center for ONE - another party with
alot of dressed up people. that's another feeling i kept getting,
eventho i was wearing a shirt & tie, i still felt out of place.
it all seemed so formal and everybody seemed so much older, altho
there wuz a group of girl scouts or something there. it was 
definitely more of a family thing.

UHM DATS NICE STEVIE, WHAT ABOUT THE SHOW?

ok, ok, the show...1st off lemme say the music through all the acts
were right on. much props to World Techno Tribe for providing accurate
underground sounds. there were times i wanted to get outta my seat
& bust a move myself. uhm do they have a CD out or anything? i'd
definitely buy it! 2nd - the lighting, hmm i wonder how Chip from 
Eyegasm would've handled it, but again right on. i especially liked
the twilight lighting of the later acts. but it would've been neat
to see some intellabeams or a few laser beams hit some of those 
dancers. but i dunno if their budget could handle it.

THE SHOW STEVIE, THE SHOW!!! AHHHH !!!! WHY CAN'T U JUST FOR ONCE!!!

ok i'm gonna talk about the show now, really. believe it or not i've
actually taken some dancing while i was in college. just one class
tho - modern dancing - nothing like the classical harder to do stuff
they were doing. and it wuz actually pretty tuff. i only got a 'B',
prolly (hey had to stick that word in there some where!) cuz i missed
one to many classes. but anyways, for the class we had to come up with
a 10 minute routine set to music. and you know what it wuz hard as fuk.
picking out the music alone was hard enuff, let alone picking moves
that went along with it & then coordinating it for one ten minute 
sequence, it wuz a bitch of an assignment. ok now take 25 dancers,
2 hours of music, multiple acts, multiple themes, coordinating all
the dancers, coordinating all their moves to the music, the mood, &
the theme. its a helluvah (there's another abbreviated word for yah)
lotta work! months of practice.

CUT THE B.S. GIMME THE NITTY GRITTY

it's pretty evident that classical ballet dancing is a world of 
difference from the modern day rave dancing that myself and the typical
raver do. so when we watch this show, we are looking at it thru biased
eyes. classical ballet dancing is meant for classical music, it
concentrates on the flow of the song. thus the graceful movements
of classical ballet dancers. techno music is a world of difference
from classical music. now there's beats. build ups. waves. vibes.
as a result a techno dancer/raver is gonna move much different then
a ballet dancer. so here's me in my set ways of seeing how ravers
dance. and when i hear techno music, i expect dancers to dance a
certain way. so to be honest i felt a li'l distaste for the formalized
version of the show. mostly cuz the dancers were not moving to the
beat. i mean the #1 prerequisite of a good rave dancer is u have to
move to the beat. they weren't moving to the beat. plus alotta of
their moves seemed like weak imitations of modern rave moves. at 
times i felt that myself or leidra or jeff could've got up there
& totally done a better job (gawd damn this sounds severely cocky!)
actually me & leidra had a li'l discussion about this afterwards
(btw i didn't know leidra had taken ballet for three years & i always
thought she wuz a naturally good dancer). but y'see here's where
we're wrong. y'see we're so set in our modern way of dancing, we
fail to recognize all the hard work that goes into classical dancing.
go back to the previous paragraph for a rehash. i mean some of these
guys have been studying this for over ten years or all their life.
they're coming from a whole different avenue. an avenue, that took
years of practice, where only the best go on. i don't think people
realize how competitive it is to be a classical dancer these days,
remember that movie Flashdance. dancers are severly under-rated.
but atleast their getting recognition. hell, rave dancers are the
bottom of the barrel. sure we may look all fly at raves, but what
can it do for us. these best ballet dancers can make some serious
dough! we, hell we gotta pay to get into partys! u can almost say
everytime u go to a party & watch the circle dancers, yur getting a
free show. i think another ironic thing is a few of my dancer friends
like carol, holly, danielle, stevie (not me, my female friend stevie),
they're professional dancers of the adult version. they usually    
earn money for their dancing & at parties yur getting it for free.

so in a nutshell (before i waste anymore bandwidth), the show gave
a greater appreciation of classical dancing as well as modern day
rave dancers.

one highlight for me wuz the teamwork involved in some of the acts.
i especially liked it when they all got together and conglomerated 
into a seemingly giant living organisms w/ mutiple arms & legs moving
to the music. i started thinking how SUDDEN IMPULSE - Balletmet Columbus - 3/1/95 - Columbus, Ohio
-------------------------------------------------------------

YUP PRE-PARTY B.S.

so james, carol, & myself headed down to the heart of ohio once
again this time for something completely different...an actual
techno ballet. welp since carol didn't get off work 'til 6pm,
we got to columbus kinda late. alls i can say is $5 dollars for 
parking! geesh & i thought cleveland parking wuz expensive,
maybe i just picked the most expensive place to park or something.
welp since we were late already, we decided to hit a Subway
nearby to grab a bite to eat since Carol hadn't eaten dinner
yet. it wuz by pure luck that when we came out of Subway, we
bumped into Jonathan & Steve aka DJ Animate & DJ Sense, who just
spun at Superfly (and who were spinning the afterhours for Sudden
Impulse at Leslie's pad). it turned out they were late cuz they
had to work too. so the four of us (james didn't come cuz he
didn't have a ticket plus his girl, anne, wuz pickin him up to
go to her birthday party in athens - ZODIAC) headed in.

STEVIE DOING MORE OF THAT NAME DROPPIN THANG

we finally arrived in the Capitol Theatre (it took us awhile to
actually find the damn place) at 9pm, right during intermission.
people were coming out to go to the bathrooms & to chat. lo &
behold we bump into stephen hindman aka Kingsize & his female
friend. we asked what we had missed. he said we really didn't
miss much since the earlier acts were more classical & the
later acts are the more modern techno-lized acts. and later on
when we bumped into leslie, the one who wuz promoting it, she
confirmed it. but she said we missed the one interesting act
that had the players in suits - sort of a yuppy gets loose thing.

AS PROMISED - SHIRT & TIE

oh yeah, as promised, Star*, i showed up in my business attire:
white collar shirt, silk tie, & black cords (Fresh Jive of course!).
u may say i cheated a li'l since most people there were dressed up
- it wuz a ballet in a major theatre, but most of the rave kids
there were in their baggies or typical informal attire (cough,
jonathan, cough, steven, cough, titonton, cough, ed, i better

apologies for that previous major waste of bandwidth, not only 
did it cut me off but it repasted the whole thing over again!
argh!!!

rather than retyping the whole thing over again & wasting more
bandwidth i'll just finish it up here.

here's what i wuz saying before i wuz so rudely interrupted...

=================================================================
one highlight for me wuz the teamwork involved in some of the acts.
i especially liked it when they all got together and conglomerated 
into a seemingly giant living organisms w/ mutiple arms & legs moving

=================================================================

and here's the rest of it...

to the music. i thought how kewl it would be if a buncha really
good rave dancers got together, got organized, & did something
like this.

well anyways, major props to leslie for inviting me to the ballet
& for giving me free tickets much appreciated. props to david
nixon for choreographing the show. props to howell binkley for 
the lighting design. and finally last but not least props to all
the dancers of Balletmet - way too many to list.

sorry i wuz not able to make it to the afterparty, but i had a
previous engagement...

    I produce all original video for projection at raves around the U.S.  I
have projected at over 60 raves in 1995 alone.  My company is called OVT
Visualz (we go under many other names though).  We are based in Chicago and
provide the most eye seering, brain frying video and film projections
around.  We have worked with Ministry (currently on their '96 tour),
Legendary Pink Dots, Die Warzau, EMF, Thrill Kill Kult, etc.   I am
currently selling a tape of my work called Probe.  It has a hardcore techno
mix by DJ EFEX from Chicago.  DJ EFEX has spun all around the country and
is especially loved in LA/San Fran.

     Probe is a video designed to stimulate the mind.  This program acts as
a seratonin releaser increasing mental awareness and feelings of euphoria
during and after viewing.  Some have even called Probe a new high tech
psychoactive drug.

     Probe was produced using the latest neural implant technology.  As the
test subject listened to hardcore techno music (by Chicago's DJ EFEX) his
mind began producing images which were picked up by the neural receptor
implanted in his brain.  The high resolution images were subsequently
recorded on videotape after the brain waves were processed into a video
signal.

     Probe has been seen around the country at various rave parties and
mental health clinics.  All who have seen Probe agree that it has affected
them in a positive way.  Many many copies have been sold so far.   Check
out the web site for my company and Probe at:
http://www.mcs.net/~ovt/

p.s. tapes from various events are also for sale, along with film loops
(new and used)  email me for more info.  Thanks, Brian

Subject: How do have a good party 
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Apparently, some people still don't have a clue on how to have a party. I 
posted this 2 years ago...I might as well do it again.

-0- Make a budget and have 150% of the money upfront (nothing ever works the 
way you want and there are always new expenses)

-1- Find a building. Pick a date WHEN the building is available. Sign a 
contract and paid your deposit.

-2- Find your DJ's, make a contract, send deposit and airplane tickect if 
needed

-3- Find a sound company, sign contract, send deposit and make sure the 
electricity is adquate

-4- Find a Light company, sign contract, send deposit and make sure the 
electricity is adquate for them too. (lights usualy need twice as much power 
that sound)

-5- Design your flier, print them and hit the right places.

-6- Find a good security company, sing contract and same for off duty police 
officers

-7- Find a person that you trust and is an outsider to the scene to do the 
door (money)

-8- Do your guest list and stick to it

-9- Get hotel rooms for the DJ's, sound and light crew.

-10- Get a good smart bar. Juices are important while people dance for 12 
hours.

-11- Sleep well the nite before the event.

-12- Have the party, BE responsible and take care of your patrons.

Those are the basic rules...there is more to it, but I will not waist my time 
on that.
If you can't follow that, why even try ?????????????????

ZODIAC - Anne - 3/1/96 - Athens, Ohio
-------------------------------------

TYPICAL BEE ASS OF THE PRE-PARTY NATURE

So after SUDDEN IMPULSE, Leslie took our pictures & invited us to
go to the After Party at her pad. i really wanted to go check it
out but we had made previous engagements for ZODIAC, Anne's B-Day
Party in Athens. Btw if anybody (ed) went to the afterhours, tell  
me how it wuz, cuz i know steve & jonathan & titonton & kingsize
were s'posed to spin at it.

welp after leaving the venue we decided to caravan to jonathan's
pad to chill a bit. leidra & breaker jeff jumped into steve's car
& we all headed out. at the place, we had a li'l dilema, there
were three partys going on that night: the Sudden Impulse after
party, Zodiac, and another party at the art apartments, apparently
some dayton dj's were playing there that night (if anybody went to
that - alroy, desmond, spill the beans).  jonathan & steve
were booked to spin at the after party so they had to go to that.
and carol & i had made plans to meet up w/ james, anne, jinx, & his
girl in athens for zodiac. finally liedra, jeff, & mike decided to
come w/ us. so after stopping at leidra's place for them to change
out of their evening attire & into party clothes & a brief stop at
white castle's, we were off to athens...   

IF YUR DOWN IN ATHENS O-H, YOU WON'T GET VERY FAR BEFORE YOU HEAR
PEOPLE SHOUT: WANT-SOME-KIND-BUDS-NOW!!! (STEVIE'S LAME B-52'S IMITATION)

an hour & a half later we were in kind bud country, i mean athens, ohio.
the party wuz located at the Swindle Fish Saloon in downtown Athens.
three bux for three dj's and a live act, can't beat that! it wuz so
cheap, i had no quams covering breaker jeff's ass (cuz he wuz broke).
i think carol covered leidra's. it's always us oldies w/ jobs covering
the broke newbies! it wuz also byob, so i headed out to the car to
grab the st.pauli's girls i just so happened to have in the hatch
(i dunno some 6th sense told me to bring beer, glad i did). if u've
never been to the Swindle Fish Saloon, it's yur typical college bar
w/ the bar up front, pool tables in the back, stage on the left, &
dance floor in the middle.

we joined james & anne, who were in the back shooting pool. got to
see a buncha surprising faces i never thought to see in athens: brian
from UPS, kelly & chad, even some kat i hadn't seen in ages from 
sandusky (had to tell'em there wuz a party in toledo the next day
w/ detroit dj's!).

me, leidra, jeff, & mike got on the cramped floor for a li'l bit
during lemon lyman's funky house set. but just wuzn't able to get
our groove on - too cramped w/ too many fluffy college types. so
we decided to head back in the corner to drink our beers. then out
of sheer boredom, we had to follow athens tradition & all headed 
into the men's bathroom for a li'l smoke & taggin. and as usual
when i get dragged into it, something freaky happens. but this
time it didn't happen to me. it happened to carol. for some reason
carol's who only had one beer & has smoked it for most of her life,
started getting really sick. she asked me to walk her outside, but
we never made it. she fainted three times on the way there. the
last time wuz right before the door, she couldn't hold it anymore.
and she lost it all over the floor. i could only hold her hand as
her body did what a body does when it doesn't like what it had taken.
i helped clean herself up as people from behind stared & others
came in thru the front door. it wuz a bad situation, but what could
i do, i couldn't leave her.                                        

afterwards i walked her out to the car. as jinx comforted her. i 
had to go back to the bar to inform the rest that we had to go.
on the drive back, carol blamed it on all the other stuff she had
done in the past. 

THE MORAL OF THE STORY

so why did i share all this with you? some times partys ain't all 
that fun.  some times things happen at them that open your eyes. life
can't always be one big party. if yur gonna party all yur life, it's
eventually gonna take it's toll on you. take it from two old timers
that know. if yur gonna party, party smart. travel w/ friends that u
know will be there for you if some thing happens or better yet just
don't do it at all, because it just might come back atcha later on
one way or another. take care of yourself, becuz if u don't, who will?

Hey all,

	Just to update the people on Bass Kulture, this coming Monday 
will be our first month's anniversary.  That's right, four consecutive 
Mondays and we haven't been canned, burned to the ground, or abused by 
the public in any way.  So, if you're into continuing the week-end one 
more day, and you just can't get enough bass, come to KAYA, in the Strip 
District, and get your fill.  (Sorry, but you still need ID to get in)

This Monday, all the ladies get in free, by popular demand, with drink 
specials and all 'dat 10 to midnight. 

Check out http://www.pitt.edu/~tshst4/basskulture.html for past and 
present flyers, and other info.

DJs on the wheels 10pm-2am,

The following message is in response to the numerous queries I've 
received on these matters.
For those of you that don't know, I'm Joe LeSesne the guy behind 1.8.7 
and produce tracks under the name 1.8.7 as well as the collaboration with 
dancehall artist and jungle MC Soy Sos under the name Rock Stone Foundation.

First thing first....

The Tape:

The much awaited 1.8.7 demo is still in the works. Yes I know I said it 
would be completed by the end of January. Here is what happened. Each 
time I thought it was finished I was getting started or near completion 
on yet another "even better track than all those before it: so as a 
result I decided to take my time and put out a quality tape jam packed 
with the most recent stuff as well as the older stuff so as to avoid 
releasing a "dated sounding" tape as had happened in the past. The tape 
now will be between 90 and 110 minutes. It will also be a high-bias tape 
made directly from DAT and will come with a full cover j-card cover as 
well as a color insert featuring pictures from the past that document the 
evolution of 1.8.7 over the last four years. (Hint: you may find some of 
these on hyperreal).

This tape will be ready no later than April 2,1996 and is availble 5 ways:

1 - Ordering it direct from UDG Inc's mixtape catalogue.
2 - Ordering it or purchasing it at a party from Fusion Productions.
3 - (If in Pittsburgh) stopping by Collectors 12" and bugging them for a copy.
4 - Buying one by stopping me at a party and getting a copy directly (if 
     I have any!)
5 - Email me at the above address (not recommended since this account is 
slow and I don't check my mail often.)

Contact:
UDG Inc. 	@ 412.734.1467
Fusion 		@ 717.541.9690
Collector's 12"	@ 412.683.4033
my email @ *look up above*

For those of you who get free tapes (you know who you are, this includes 
promoters) email me and I will sort you out with one.




The Vinyl

1.8.7 and Soy Sos of CFI Massive recently inked a deal with Jungle Sky 
Music for the release of our debut 12" under the name Rock Stone Foundation.
This release includes 4 mixes to choose from. A full vocal mix, a chopped 
up hardstep dub, a hip-hop mix and a dancehall reggae mix. The track is 
called Dis Soun' and its our statement against shoddy sound guys and dodgy 
promoters who insist on putting the jungle DJ's and MC's on an inferior 
sound system. Dis Soun' will rule up the nation beginning in April.





The CD

Rock Stone Foundation has been informed that the Hardstep mix of Dis 
Soun' will be featured on the "This is Jungle Sky II" compilation CD also 
due to be released in April.

For further information on either the 12" or the CD call Jungle 
Sky/Liquid Sky at: 212.260.4656

Additionally one of my tracks will be on the Fusion05 compilation tape. 
By the way that Fusion is not associated with Fusion Productions who's 
number I listed above. You may purchase the Fusion05 tape by emailing:
cfnoel@freenet.columbus.oh.us




Bookings

Currently my bookings are being handled through UDG Inc, and Drop 
Entertainment Ltd.

UDG Inc can be reached at 412.734.1467
Drop can be reached at either 212.330.8233 or 212.330.9111.

You may also try to reach me directly at 412.931.4618 or at the above 
address but as I said, I do not check my email often and there is a 
chance that if I am not home when you called I won't get your message.
Its best to try one of the numbers above as well as call me directly.


Media(Press)

For the locals, you may want to pick up the March 15th edition of the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and look inside for the Weekend Magazine section. 
The cover story is on dieselBoy, myself and Nathalie of Lollipop 
Productions. There is a lengthy interview with each of us and some 
pictures from Protoculture. Incidentally, the article was done by a 
report friend of mine, Stephanie who is also a raver so it shouldn't be 
the typical sensationalist stuff you are used to seeing in such a 
mainstream paper.



Media(TV)

There is a chance I may be on TV doing a live PA as part of a Montel
Williams show on you guessed it, Jungle in particular and raves in
general. I was asked if I would be open to the possibility of doing it by
the person organizing the thing (who was asked by Montel) and I said
"sure, why not." Have no fear folks, I think they are trying to do the
show on the music mainly. 


thats it for now

hi all,
    sorry to clutter your mailboxes with this letter, but i just wanted to
apoligize
to anyone who tried to reach me in the last 2 weeks (dbf, baron, psiber,
count 0, etc...).  your messages either bounced or i just didn't reply.  i
was in the process of changing accounts, and the whole thing was quite
screwy.  but i'm back now, and HAPPIER than ever!  so if you tried to write
me, please try it again.  thanks for your patience.

love,
ryu

SUBCOORDINATE REACTOR - Underground Resistance - 3/2/96 - Toledo, Ohio
----------------------------------------------------------------------

U KNOW HOW IT GOES

After dropping Carol off i think i got in at around 8am. i wuz actually
too tired to sleep. i had driven for 8 hours totally the previous night.
after eating some breakfast i finally got some shut eye at around 10am.
thank gawd i didn't hafta work that morning like i usually hafta. slept
for nine hours straight. got up @ 7pm. took a shower, ate & called jeff,
who reminded me that SUBCOORDINATE REACTOR wuz that night. "oh yeah!"
wuz my reaction. i ignored my body aches from the previous night & got 
ready to go to Toledo.

Jeff came by to pick me up around 9pm. we headed over to the west side to
pick up holly & mary. we wuz s'posed to hook up w/ hannah, mark, joe, &
sinead, but we were way off schedule & would hafta meet'em at the party.
it wuz kinda weird cuz last night wuz the old skool trek - both myself &
james are 25 and carol is 27. this night wuz new skool night w/ jeff's
friend's holly - 16, mary - 18, sinead - 18, and hannah, mark, joe, & jeff
all 19.

THE VENUE

we arrived at the venue at around 11:30pm to discover that backpacks were
not permitted so both me & mary had to freeze our asses off again to drop
off our back packs in the car - there wuz alotta complaints about that
that night especially since mary had feminine items she needed in her bag.
we even had to go thru a hand held metal detector just to get into the
place. it wuz kinda weird cuz there wuz a hip hop party going on the 2nd
floor & the rave wuz upstairs. mebbe that's why they were being so harsh
at the door - for the hip hop party.

there wuz hardly anybody there when we walked thru the black plastic into
the main & only room. Hannah, Sinead, Mark, & Joe arrived about fifteen
minutes after we did. welp i finally figured out that Mark wuz the Rabbit
in the Moon kid from Loyola that Kate (Keight on vrave) wuz talking about
& who i had confused w/ Ben (Cylert on mw-raves) (did u hear that Kate &
Ben i finally got to meet the real Rabbit in the Moon kid!). i wuz kinda
surprised when Lisa & Drew showed up, some old skoolahs! but i forgot she
used to go to Toledo. ok enuff name droppin for now, better talk a li'l
about the party...

THE VISUALS

mad props to VJ ZMAN of ZIMWARE who provided some mad acidic visuals on
the far wall - first thing i noticed when i walked in. that's something
partys have been lacking lately good visuals - hell friggin project ren
& stimpy on a wide screen & u'll keep most trippers happy. i'll even 
drop their www addy for u web heads: http://www.afn.org/~cthugha. oh
hell here's their e-mail addy too while i'm at it: USFMD3PV@IBMMAIL.COM
that's for TWYLIGHT PRODUCTIONS, cuz i think they were the ones that  
were involved w/ the party anywaze.

THE SOUND

oooh nelly & i thought it wuz loud @ TEKNOSAURUS 2. two huge stacks in
the front. and a stack in the corner provided near perfect surround
sound. but it wuz a good thing they left that one corner blank, cuz dats
where ravahs had to retreat to when it all got to be too much. my ears
were ringin the whole way back & most of the next day cuz it wuz a bit
too much.

THE FOG

speakin o too much. cough, cough, hack, hack! the fog machine dude must've
smoked one too many cuz like indydave & desmond sed, the thing went into
over drive! the fog wuz so sick Lisa said she had closed her eyes while
she wuz dancing & when she opened'em she had no idea what direction she
wuz facing. there wuz a couple times the same rave chica bumped into me
cuz she couldn't see where she wuz dancin! and like indydave sed, there
wuz some serious fog stench in the air! sure u need it for lasers, but
gawd damn there were no lasers at the party. it wuz kinda weird starin
at the floor wonderin where yur feet are!

THE MUZIK

welp since the fog wuz so thick (not that i recognized any of the dj's
anywaze) and since there were no dj schedules handed out like they have
w/ most partys (here's a clue to all u rave producers out there, print
out schedules, yur crowd will thank u for it, especially the ones who
appreciate the music!), the only dj's i recognized wuz K1/AUX 88 who
wuz spinning when we walked in cuz i asked someone & ROLANDO cuz i had
just met him two weeks ago when he played CHINESE NEW YEAR in cleveland.
the other dj's: JAMES PENNINGTON, TRACKMASTER LOU, MR. BILL - i have no
idea who spun when. but suffice it to say all the dj's kicked my ass
all night long - nuff said.

THE VIBE

welp  the thick fog & the dj confusion all made for a strange vibe.
alotta kids didn't know what to make of it & started wiggin askin around
for paper or whatevah they could get their hands on. we got concerned
when mary started askin cuz she specifically told us to smack her if 
she ever asked for it again. so we did what any good friends would've,
we provided the hugs & the love for her to last the night. and then
some thing strange happened. i can not describe it. the positive vibes
spread outward. AND THEN IT HAPPENED. it all started so innocently,
mary & sinead had just gotten some water (oh yah the free H2O wuz much
appreciated!). they placed it on the floor. and then they started 
dancing around it. then they dragged me into it. and then jeff. and
then mark. and then joe. and then hannah. and then holly. and then
some more friends & then more friends. YES LONNIE, THE CIRCLE DANCE 
YOU DREAMED ABOUT HAPPENED IN TOLEDO OHIO THAT NIGHT. granted the
entire room didn't get into it. but it wuz definitely there. omigawd
it wuz so tribal, so totally upliftingly spiritual in such a chaotic
modern world. and i wuz so happy i wuz a part of it. it happened once
again that night, but i wuz not involved in that one. i wuz to beat
plus i had to do some thinking...

THE POINT

all the thick fog & the anonymous dj's all made things very clear to me
that night. sure music has always been the driving force. but it has
always been the people, the dancers that provided the vibe. u could have
the best dj in the world spinning at a party, but if all the people are
out of it & nobody is dancing - there is no vibe. perhaps a few of u
mw-ravers were @ Ladybust 2...tons of kids were trapped outside, there
wuz no music. but there were alotta happy bopping ravahs - there wuz a
vibe! or take example Heavan for u ne-ravers, it got busted pretty good
too. all these rave kids forced back out into the cold. granted most
kids were pissed. but then something happened. kids started making their
own music w/ their mouths, their hands, whatevah they could think - 
they created their own vibe! 

and to think detroit one of if not the most musically focused cities helped
provide this night to bring the focus back where the vibe comes from
- the people. i think they planned to set that fog machine on overdrive.

i think steve cinch put it best when he wuz talkin about how terry mullen
wuz going off about all the trainspotters in chicago -- here are all these
kids, they paid twenty dollars to get into this party & all they wanna do
is stand there for two hours and watch me spin? get a life! go and have 
some fun! it's a party y'know.

so now y'know why my reviews are the way they are.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far

   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the

    i know what you mean about the mad circle.  mary and sinead pulled me
    and some others into one at superfly, only there we danced around
    a monkey, whose name eludes me at the moment.

    i definitely agree with you on this one.  when i first started goin
    to parties, it was for the music.  i would talk to people if they
    talked to me, but i didn't make any kind of effort to meet people.
    then, i started meeting all kinds of people, incl.
    a bunch of net.ravers.  that's when i started to realize that no matter
    what happens at a party, as long as there are friends there, there
    is fun to be had.  freakshow in dayton was one of the better parties
    i've been to, and what i remember most about that party is getting
    there and seeing a whole lot of people i hadn't expected to see.
    that vibe kept me goin all night!
    
    people can get together without music, and still have a good time,
    but play the music without people, and nobody hears it!
    
    peace,
    darrik <--- official member of stevie t's fan club!

    No doubdt, it was *MAD* cold out that night.  We had to go back to the car
    to put our bags back too.  However, that wasn't as bad as it was when we
    were leavin'.  That just sucked.  It was even colder then.

    Yeah, it was nice to get a break from the typical "house/acid/jungle"
    routine and get some electro flowin' through me.  Robotic dancin' is always
    fun.  =D

    Yeah, I was in the second circle and have to say it was TOTALLY KEWL!  More
    O' that is definitely needed at partays.  At that point the vibe really
    turned around for me.  When I first got there I was overwhelmed by the
    vaporvibe in the room.  Only a few people were really gettin' into it.  My
    friends were even talking about leaving right away.  Then later on
    everybody started gettin' down and it just rocked!  The dancers at that
    party made it happen.  *hugz* to all of you out there.
    
    
    >always been the people, the dancers that provided the vibe. u could have

    DEFINITELY!  I've met some of the most AWESOME VIBED people ever not when
    chatting but when dancing! That's when it always happens.  Parties get to
    this point early in the mornin' where everybody just starts to get down and
    then the fun starts.  =)  BTW, I know exactly what you mean about Ladybust
    2.  I think there was prolly more vibe outside that building than inside.
    
    
    Anyway, there's my two cents worth...  =)

well, as of saturday, alot of us will be in the newly formed "330" posse,
thanks to the foresightedness of the telecom industry and to everyone who
has 18 different fone numbers.  (beeber, cell, fax, modem, voice mail, home,
business). sigh and i dont know how ameritech is going to handle anyone
calling here with the 216 area code???  oh well, such is life...  :(   trouty...

I was talking to the promoter at Bass Kulture last week.  It's the same 
crew who did ATLANTIS last summer at the Paint Ball wharehouse in 
Pittsburgh.  It sounds like a good party ... held in one of those Day 
Care - Kiddi places.  You know what I mean?  A spot with a room full of 
plastic balls, tunnels, trampeleins, all the Sesame Place kinda tricks.  
Another plus ... free refreshments (which may just mean a water fountain :-)

prolly' see you there.

What a night :)

I finally recovered from that wonderfull night.

The space was the warehouse on 901-a 15th...the same one used for Technosaurus 
2. Jason Clark and his friend designed the ambient room and put a few couches 
to be comfy. The rest was naked. The sound was set up as a wall with quad bass 
bins in the middle. The dj was set up far away from the wall to prevent 
feedback.

The DJ s :
Lenny Fucking Dee : The first record he put on was a voice saying his name 
then the beat came violently. I was watching the crowd from the sound board. 
When the beat came, people got scared and backup a little bit. He aimed to 
kill...Even if you did not like hardcore, you would have love him. He played 
HARD, they was no soft spots. He was beating up people left and right...: "you 
want some more, here you go". He was furious behind the 2 turntables. I went 
crazy during his set. I gave him +4 db on system...I did not care if it blew 
up or not...I gave him every single watts I could find. People were sweating 
so much during his set, the floor was wet !!!! Where did he get all that 
energy ?

Ian Mariano : super nice trance...he made people dream.

Carlos : back to his roots. a lot of Latino music that made people feel realy 
good.

Theory Collapse did not come due to problems with their keyboard...I really 
wanted to see them.

The sound : I guess my system was abused and approved by Lenny Dee. 
The Lights : 8 mini Ultra scan 200 MSD aligned and 4 Dataflash on the wall of 
speaker. 2 lasers on the top of the DJ. It is someone else's job to review my 
light show.

The vibe was as good as (if not better) Technosaurus 2. It was strong and 
intense. The energy was realy present. I think this is so far the best party 
this year.

That was a nite to remember.

hi all! haven't heard from me in a while have you :)

well, i went to daydream on sat. mar 9.... wow, it was certainly a phat
party!  I saw so many people i haven't seen in ages, i saw so many people
that i see every day but i never see at raves, i just felt so happy to be
surrounded by so many friends.  Its like what Steve T wrote in his review of
the Dayton party he went to, raves are great because of the music, but even
more important are all the wonderful people there - all the friends you meet
there, and all the friends you make - i LUV it!

Okay - so the party.... it was at United Skates of America - i passed the big
black tarpes onto the floor to see people gracefully wizzing past me on
roller skates and i couldn't help but exclaim "ahhh! i am going to have to
bum some skates off someone eventually!" b/c the people skating looked like
they were having so much fun.  All throughout the place you could tell who
was on skates b/c while most of the people would sorta bop as they walked,
some just gracefully glided accross the floor.  Then i found out that the
skates were free!!!  Needless to say it took me no time to find myself lacing
up a pair of too-big skate onto my little feet.  Unfortunately i have not
skated in a LONG time and it was a scary experience.  :)  It only took about
two laps around the place (full speed and lacking any ability to stop -
little to no ability in the steering department :) ) finally i just aimed
myself at the wall where i had dumped my shoes and went flying into it :)
 But it was all good b/c sitting there on the floor was this nice young man
who i ended up chatting with for some time - Dave something...kewl DJ from
Detroit, came all the way to cleve. for our kick-ass party! :)  

but not to worry - my little incident with the skates did not hamper my night
:)

The location was great.  The lights were fat!  All sorts of lasers and lights
- but no excessive fogging, only what was necessary (too many times have i
been suffacated and sickened under the thick dense smog created by a fog
machine that someone neglected to turn off - does anyone remember FADED in
columbus last summer? Holy crap - it was in a skating rink so not only was in
0degrees inside and 90degrees outside - that would make anyone sick to begin
with - they BLASTED the fog machines to the point that i thought i was going
to puke!)

There were a lot of people there, a really diverse crowd i must say!  I had
started out my evening on a rather unfortunate note.  Private relationship
turmoil in which i had the pleasure of finding out i had been totally screwed
by this ass, and he didn't even have the balls to talk to me about it, and to
top it off he had the gaul to show up that night.  So that had me sorta sick
to my stomache - which i ignored till i suddenly realized i was truely sick
with something real...stumbled off to the bathroom, unfortunatly i was
dehidrated and hadn't really eaten much that day, so there wasn't anything
but air to come up....so that sucked, it wasnt even anything a little (or a
lot) of pepto could help.  But i really didn't care.  I got to dance for a
few hours until this nausea hit me, so i was content enough, and i had a ball
sitting on the stage and watching everyone dance.  Whats really great about
cleveland is the diversity!  I mean in chicago or detroit or pittsburgh or
colubus, there is a certain type of dancing that is featured in each scene.
 You can't help but notice the style of dancing that each city has...but in
cleve there really is no one style!  Everyone there was dancing differently,
we all just lose ourselves in the music...the only thing common to the
dancing is the beat that everyone is following..not to mention the diversity
in the music...

which leads me on the the MUSIC

oh my gaud!  Green Velvet.  :)  When i heard Claude Young break out the Green
Velvet track at a party in columbus a while ago, i was in heaven....  then
green velvet live in cleve. :) "where all the little kiddies go to lose their
minds"  no nausea could hold me back :)  they spun all the tracks that i LUV,
the "Im losing my mind" and "cameras ready - prepare to flash"  it was great.
All the music was great.  I am not a jungle dancer - i just rarely find
myself gettin down to jungle beats, but i had to appreciate deisleboy and the
few dancers there who really knew how to lose themselves in his set.  The
whole night was great!  Everyone was just having a blast, so many smiling
faces!   When i found myself unable to dance(i dunno if anyone can relate to
the stomach situation i had - but jumping around was just about the most
miserable thing to do) i ran around and socialized, so many people were
there!  If anyone had a happy little girl come up and "Betty them" that was
me :)  i had a grand time sticking little fuzzy laddy bugs, which i named
Betty, to people, it just made them smile :)

well, lots of luv
leah

I dunno what to say - anyone who had anything to do with this party has my
appreciation, i luved it!

	hi gang this is Crisbee with a little word of precaution...  well 
hmm lets see  I'm not going to go on about whether this promoter is a 
good guy or not but i will say that i do not trust him! i know a few 
things about him that make me not have such a great feeling about him... 
the 3 parties that i know of that he has thrown have each been 'produced' 
under different production names.  if carlos is going to be in da burgh i 
will definately be there even though the rest of the line up i can hear 
almost any time.  if the party goes off.. well then props to him but i 
myslef am a little worried about going. IM NOT SPREADING RUMORS but im 
just giving little words of advise about using and or flashing your 
paraphenalia (sp) around. BE CAREFULL and be aware!

much love, 
crisbee

p.s. I work at Chuck E. Cheese and since this is going to be at a place 
just like that (Discovery Zone) which is a kids place i just want to say 
please watch what you leave behind and *giggle* watch your own behind too! ;)

Hi ya people!

My name is Aristotelis and I am from Crete of Greece.
I've been here in Pittsburgh since October at the Art Institute.
Back home I used to party a lot.
One moderate night was to meet with my friends, go around the bars,
then to a movie, the to eat, drink something again and then go for
a bit of clubing.

I am much into underground rave.
Jungle is my thing but that also includes breakbeat, intelligent,
hardstep, drum&bass and ofcourse all the other music of trance, hard 
trance, goa, gabber, ambiend, old techno, everything BUT commercial
house and "techno"!
Good for dancing but more than a couple, no!

So, I find out about this mailing list in alt.rave and I was hoping to
help me get into th PA scene.
I havn't been on a club here as I really don't know the night life yet
and was afraid of the music (thanks but no hip-hop and american "techno"
and although I love alternative I prefer something else to dance to).
And being "underaged" here (almost twenty) doesn't help things much!

Anyway...Peace, love and unity bros and sistas!

Tsiou!
Aristotelis

    Date: Mon, 11 Mar

    
    Let me  tell you 1st about the progression of my techno event
    awareness....... 
     
    1st.....the drugs-I realized I could get all the drugs I want and do em 
    without interruption.(lasted till i got to my 1st party) 
     
    2nd.....the friendlyness of everyone around me- the closeness of 
    strangers that are my good friends b4 I even say hi! to them(lasted 
    till the brooklyn bombs invaded me) 
     
    3rd.....the beats- this wuz at a point where drugs were borin' for me. They
    didn't do much for me anyway anymore besides make me forget everything
    besides what kinda E I took. and at this point realized how evil it all
    really is. and how lots of these promoters 
    don't truly love us kids payin' the 25 bux to get them there Mac'in 
    loot. This when i realize no matter how bad sh5t got, there wuz always good
    traxx. This is my one love they can never be taken  
    away from me. Music has somehow molded my thingin' and relives 
    any tension I have trapped in side of me. And no matter how 
    much of an as5hole a dj/producer is, this still has no bearin' 
    on the quality of traxx he or she puts out.  
     
    4th.....the energy of it all- this happened 2 nites ago @ Daydreamer, in
    Ohio. For the 1st time in months, I felt I actually 
    belonged at a party. And for the 1st time, i felt the strong 
    presence of an enegry created from the ppl and the beats as one. 
    It wuz a a great feelin', even though I wuzn't diggin' the music 
    too much, the ppl and the enegry wuz enough to drive me that 
    feelin' of ecstacy I used to get after goin' to me 1st raves. 
     
    I really though that in 96 i wuz gunna sit back and relax. 
     
     
     
     
    F5CK THAT!!!!! 
    FIVE IS ALIVE ONCE AGAIN IN 96' 
     
    PLUR to those that have taught me what it really means. 
    I'm not namin' names, but basicaly all those on the list i've meet in
    person, plus many more have been helpful to bringin' me to my 
    state of awareness and happyness.  
     
    much plur to the true plur ne-ravers 
    andy b*

GET LIFTED - The Underground Church of Soul - 3/6/96 - Cleveland, OH
--------------------------------------------------------------------

PPBS

got home from work @ 11:30pm. popped a tv dinner in the nuke. fuk
changing, did the Star* thing & showed in my shirt & tie. can't
beat $2 admission w/ college id!

DA SPACE

small bar, small dance floor, tables in the back on both sides, small
pool table, vip rooms, nice space - i like it better than extreme.

DA MUZIK

only recall two sets: kevin cunningham's (Super K) & Jinx's.

Super K - i've always seen kevin @ clubs, but didn't knew he spun.
          always thought of him as Filly's side kick. he actually
          spun a real nice slo breaks set. got alotta the trilogy
          rave kids on the floor - more than i ever saw @ extreme.

Jinx - spun an old skool hip hop set, which also featured live
       local mc's. one of which didn't appreciate the fact that 
       a non black kid could throw down & wuz mac'in all the bettys
       (sorry - i can't help it). jinx eventually got on the mic
       himself.

the other dj's that spun that i missed:

DJ Jazz - hip hop/reggae

DJ Kevin Bumpers - breakbeat / drum n bass

DVNY - dancehall/commercial house

DA VIBE 

lotsa friends = lotsa vibe for stevie t. worth mentioning: rob
divine (now w/ blond hair), the guy who duz this night, the guy
who used to let me in the door @ the smart bar, now the whiskey.
kevin bumpers (old skool cyberave promotor), dj there who introduced
me to this dj from london w/ an extremely harsh british accent
( a bit shocking since he's black) who'll also be dj'ing there.
carol - good to see she's back on her feet again after the athens
tragedy. lady ms. lisa who asked me to go to DAYDREAM with her & i
mistakenly agreed. jenny, fly girl who i had fun dancin with. Krista,
ms peechie keen cutie w/ her MESMERISM pre-flyers. DJ Chris Pulse
with his own philosophy on life. Jeff/Stuff & Carol & her friend,
we all did late night breakfast @ My Friends afterwards.

---

DAYDREAM - Underground Peace Society - 3/9/96 - Parma, Ohio
----------------------------------------------------------- 

PPBS

welp lessee, lisa & i chilled at her pad a bit before heading to 
the party. we missed hooking up w/ jeff cuz he had to pick up mary
& sinead on the west side. we actually got lost going to the party
cuz the info line failed to mention directions coming from the east
side - go figure (u'd think one would be able to find a party in his
own town!). got there around 11:30pm.

DA SPACE

yup United Skates Skating Rink in Parma, kinda made up for Superfly,
the party that wuz s'posed to be in a skating rink, but ended up not.
yup free skates wuz kewl eventho i didn't skate. arcade games were
an added bonus as well as all the tables to sit at. there wuz also
a jewelry/paraphenelia stand and a beverage bar in the back, but no
smart bar, which explained the once again...

FAILED NET MEET

actually i completely forgot about the net meet myself. i think it's
physically impossible for ravers to keep track of what time it is
let alone remember a net meet. but i did bump into several netters
at the party: jeff/stuff w/ his west side posse (mary, sinead, hanna,
mark, joe - the holy water circle dancers - oh yah for some reason,
the water dance didn't work as well as in toledo mostly cuz there
weren't as many kids in it this time plus mr. curtin wuz spinning
some extremely boring tracks), pope troutsoup w/ his beaming flashlight
& sporting me the cider, darrick - my number one fan (sorry i forgot
yur ginsu knives), desmond w/ the columbus posse (walt, scott, & melissa)
doing the i gotta promo generator cuz the ele mentals don't go out to
partys anymore, chrisbee - long time no see pittsburger. speakin o long
time no see pittsburgers, got to chat a bit w/ hossam & dieselboy a
bit actually had to help the toronto Dose (the production crew not the
drug) chica find damian along w/ some other dj's & promotors (btw since
when did i become mr. hookup?). there were some other 'burghers in da
howse: john & ryan from the UDG posse, rick aka stickman of FUEL trippin
balls again, the Sunshine Kids w/ their FANTASTIC flyers, the WONDERLAND
kids which i'll talk about later. chilled a bit w/ elaine cuz i wuz so
bored. surprise netter wuz allroy - i thought he went to chicago. i
think i bumped into rave-a-licious from oberlin, but not certain. met
some netters from u of m, who stared @ me as if i wuz the anti-christ
( i think michigan people dislike me cuz i like the people more than
the music, which is of course sacreligious if yur from detroit - e-mail
me whoever u are), leah aka pebblesOH - believe it or not me & gabe spent
spent quite a bit o time lookin for u (i still don't think u really
exist). Lee, Brian's partner in crime for UPS (thanx for the props on the
flyer & @ the door). if there were any other netters, cough, andy b, cough,
why didn't u introduce yurself? how could u miss that obnoxious asian
kid w/ the black zett visor sportin all dat IOU & JNCO gear (toldjah
there wuz a big sale @ merry-go-round - oh btw Star* those baggies w/
the hidden velcro pockets - got'em for half price @ dat!). ok i'll 
shut up 'bout the people (atleast i didn't mention all the non-netters
i hung out w/, that would've taken another page) now eventho that's the
#1 reason i got to parties now. and on to...

DA MUZIK

PULSERVER - 1st dj we caught when we walked in. local kat who got alotta
kids on the floor to help kick the party off right.

DIESELBOY - is it me or has damian shrunk? nobody could see him in that
dj booth & wondered how he saw us. got all the jungle heads on the floor
(the dieselboy fan club wuz in full effect) altho i liked his set better
@ VIBRATION, couldn't get into it 'til TIK TAK & RELEASE brought the 
dance outta me - finally figured it out - people make me dance even more
so than the music.

DAN CURTIN - dan spun some of the best intelligent techno i've ever heard
during the beginning of his set (prolly his own stuff offa peace frog &
strictly rhythem) and then proceeded to bore me to death w/ some really
repetitive house. this wuz the turning point of the whole party. for some
reason the whole vibe got really boring there after. i think this is when
kids went to seek friends for entertainment.

CAJMERE - at first i thought he wuz D Wynn cuz dats what the schedule listed.
but alas they were fukin w/ us again. welp last time i saw Cajmere wuz when
me & nivek interviewed him for Unique Magazine @ the Smart Bar. back then
he had a big o fro & sported this cheesy muticolored hat. that wuz also the
night one of his dancers got kicked in the nose the night before while 
dancing at a club in chicago. that show wuz much better than the show
he put on @ DAYDREAM. that show had him & his dancers jumping around all
crazy over the stage & spraying that liquid confetti at the audience. this
show he couldn't play live cuz something wuz wrong w/ his equipment (the
vocals were live tho during "Cameras Ready...Prepare to Flash" song which
of course i did, flash my camera) and only featured two dancers: the same
one that got kicked in the nose the last time i saw him at the Smart Bar &
another one that wuz dressed in the green outfit he wore in TA2. they were
doing some nasty stuff on stage tho. the highlight for me wuz when he played
"It's Time For The Perculator", which brought back some old memories for me.

BOO WILLIAMS - welp Gavin Hardkiss didn't make it. so Boo replaced him. granted
Mr. Williams wuz a fine replacement, i still really expected to hear Mr.     
HardKiss. plus it seemed his set wuz really short for some reason. maybe
it wuz cuz i wuz too busy chattin w/ people.

D WYNN - i thought for sure he would play some hard detroit techno, the
stuff i like. but alas he dissapointed me w/ some low energy house. perhaps
the two previous house sets brain damaged mr. wynn a bit. again hanging
out w/ friends saved my night.

i think this wuz when mr. cajmere got on the mic & announced that they
were gonna shut the party down. this wuz just one of the many lulls during
the party & the crowd wuz getting a bit ansy. i think it wuz natalie from
pittsburgh that announced her discontent. then cajmere shocked everybody
with his rude retort telling her to shut her clit flickin trap of all 
things. what is it about chicago music producers & their big attitudes?
i mean even keoki wuzn't rude to his audience. the kids were more than
a bit disturbed after that. luckily...

JOESKI got on & spun some records. but again another dj that i've heard
spin better. i like Joeski cuz i got to hang out w/ him after Family
Affair when i took him to the airport. but it just didn't seem he wuz
up to par that night. but it may have been due to the fact that it wuz
during his set that...

MY CAMERA GOT GANKED AGAIN!

Yup, my camera got ganked in my own city! i put it down by the front 
stage on the left where all those pittsburgh kids were sitting at to
dance for a few minutes & zap! it's gone! so Chrisbee if those kids
were indeed the shady WONDERLAND kids u were refering to, spill the 
beans. hell yah i know 'bout raver Joe & his bunk E selling posse, so
i wouldn't put it past'em. and to make matters worse Lisa, the girl
i came with wuz bitching about leaving, so i had to go but i told 
Brian who wuz sitting by there to look for it before i left. so if
anybody at the party saw the kid that walked w/ my Kodak Cameo

N-JOI @ the Church - Trilogy - 3/10/96 - Cleveland, OH
------------------------------------------------------

PPBS

usually i don't review club events, but since sunday night wuz a special
occasion & since i've been neglecting my roots, i will. welp @ 1st i wuz
gonna head down w/ jeff, then james called me outta da blue so i went  
down w/ him. thanx to terence for the vip treatment @ the door, much
appreciated cuz that line looked pretty killer in the cold.

DA MUZIK

i'll cut the BS & go straight to the music...welp N-JOI wuz actually one
of the 1st techno live acts that got me into it all, so i had to go see'em.
little did i know they hadn't progressed very much - they sounded as cheesy
as ever. no matter cuz...

DA VIBE

wuz right on. like i said lotsa friends = lotsa vibe for stevie t. got to
finally throw down in a decent circle (btw if u see some kid w/ a white
hic hat doing donkey kicks in a circle on an N-Joi video, dats me, cuz
they were shooting for their video there), which i wuzn't able to do at
Day Dream for some reason. lots & lots of people there - place wuz packed!

DA PEOPLE

since the crowd wuz so diverse: ravers, clubbers, jocks, fluffs, u name it,
there were wuz no majority iow no attitudes. surprise faces wuz shannon
from columbus who wuz hangin w/ the Justus Kids from dayton. she explained
that leidra didn't make it to DAYDREAM cuz she went to the party in detroit
w/ breaker dave - mebbe that's why the vibe wuzn't perfect at DAYDREAM, cuz
it ain't a party 'til Leidra's there! chatted w/ Ian Mariano who said he had
a real fun time spinning in Louisville for Vortex. even said he held his
own spinning against Mr. Lenny Dee. but the best battle will always be
Ian's mentor - Mr. Scott Forbush vs. Lenny Dee, still the bloodiest
hardcore dj battle to date. even got the number of this girl i've been
interested in - unfortunately i accidentally washed it in the washing
machine - just my luck! so u could say it wuz a good night!

---

thus concludes another week in the 216, 'til next week...

Hey everyone...
	I just wanted to send a complete post out thanking everyone who 
helped with our data base on where dj's are from...you'll be happy to 
know that from a list of over 600 dj's we didn't have cities for the list 
was down to 159...
Unfortunately we have managed to make the list again over 500 dj's that 
we again need cities for.
As I have stated in the past our database is currently in the work 
process and hopefully, the first batch will be ready to be pressed into CD
Rom at the conclusion of the summer.
The database will include such information as different parties, 
locations, dates, prices, dj's spun, lighting, sound and optics 
companies, production companies, telephone numbers and any e-mail 
addresses we may have...
if there are any further questions feel free to contact myself or Matt...
at "ravedata@partnercomm.com"
Once again...Thanks sos much for all your help...
Ravers are definitely THE BEST!!!
Love-
Nicole

CD-ROM?  For some reason I was under the impression that this information
would be made free for ravers to check out on the WWW.  Instead, we are
going to have to buy the infomation we provided for free?  I don't know
if I would have spent 30 minutes filling in all the cities for DJ's
I knew... for someone else's business venture.  All I have to say
is that it better be one hell of a cd-rom.  And I don't think putting
at least the DJ Database on the web would be such a bad idea... I could
provide the megs...

Please don't "group reply" to this unless you feel it is absolutely 
necessary.  I would be happy to discuss this with anyone through
private e-mail.

Hey ...

	I tried to respond to your email earlier in the week, but the 
mail bounced.  Hopefully you'll get one of these copies, either privately 
or through PB-CLE Raves.  Anyways, what do you want to know?  DJ UMMMMM and 
I are both PB-CLE Raves subscribers and Bass Kulture organizers/DJs.

respect,

Toby

p.s. I'll try and re-send my original mail to you.  Also, you can leave a 
message for us on voicemail 412-456-BASS.

march 16 1996

To Be Continued...and always we must stay tuned.
Blinded we are not, for our hearts pound to the 
eternal drum leading us into enlightenment. Beings
unite for a Life, preparing a society for a World:
our land to groove and speak our minds in a PLace,
our energy amplified by the beats at 
our House, a trip to another dimension;
our House, a belief we share and a life we live;
our House, the thump and boom.
Pushing the life to a climax, pulling the spirit from the
heart, thrusting the groove for all to feel.
Imagine the ecstacy building the emotion, the emotion
building a future. An accelerated culture returns to
nature, following the calling of the land. Making our
mark for House music today and tomorrow.
One small step for man, one giant leap for House
Music.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

Submissions to: s0176326@cc.ysu.edu (preferred) or

tribe, 

	hey everyone! well lets see where should i start this post! hmm i 
was supposed to go to buss friday night with damian but my mom neede me 
to do things for her on saturday so i stayed at home! i decided to go to 
Wonderland though cause i just couldnt imagine missing carlos in my own 
town!!  i went out to see a movie with a friend first, so i got to the 
party at about 1 am! it was at a discoverzone and from the outside it 
didnt look half bad!
	my friend wasnt sure if she wanted to come in or not! we really 
didnt want to spend $15 on pittsburgh dj's.  so i went and talked to some 
of my friends that were smoking outside of the zone cause you werent 
allowned to some inside! i asked if they knew of carlos was there or if 
he was coming... they told me someone just left to go get him! so i told 
my friend in the car though she decieded to leave! i walked back over to 
the club and was talking to some friends that were haning out by the 
doors! i decided to go in.. so i did.. i just walked right in! i didnt 
pay i was checked! NOTHING! and i was sneaking in either! i thought about 
doing that cause again id didnt want to waste the money.  but well i 
didnt have to worry about that! so at this point im thinking cool if 
carlos comes im in and if he doesnt who cares!
	i went around and saw bunches of people! there werent more then 
hmm id say about 200 people there! but it was hard to tell not many 
people were dancing at all but tons of people were crawling around in the 
tubes and balls in the back! it really looked like a lot of people were 
having a good time! when i got there soji-fu just finished his set...and 
what i heard of it was pretty damn good! Dust came on next with hmm good 
house! it got me movin' hehehe but people really werent dancing much! 
	then at like 3 am starchild came on! his set was really really 
good!(except when that record skipped bad)heheh  people were still not 
dancing! i was suprised! finally jethro(from san fran) came on! i asked 
one of the promoters about carlos and she said" they went to get him but 
he wasnt on the flight...they are going to back to the next flight thats 
coming in... dont worry this happens to dj's all the time."
	Riiiiight... dj's miss their flights all the time hahaha 
whatever. at this point i finally realized that he wasnt coming. it was 
hard on me but i got though it hahaha so this other guy form sf played.  
house of course and he really was that bad! and when he played 
(sp)supercalafragilistic expealadoescious (christ my spelling is bad) 
everyone was really getting into it though!
	finally geufy came on! i have heard pretty good things about him 
though i have never heard him spin and he's a good friend of mine hehe  
it was about hmm 5 or so and he finally got the crowed out there dancing! 
his set was sooo great i really really liked it! housey i guess but jazzy 
at times! i was really surpised that they didnt put him on earlier! oh 
well! i was getting tired and was ready to leave and spike from da burgh came 
on! he was pretty good but we had to go!
	all in all the party wasnt that bad since i got in for free and i 
also got some oter free stuff!  people were passing out candy and all the 
drinks were free! they had hugs and pop   errr soda! ;) and the cleanest 
and brighest bathrooms ive been in! there were only a free netters there!
	sorry to go on and on about this just thought everyone would like 
to know.. they as i figured.. Carlos didnt show!

sorry!
much love, 
crisbee :)

about wonderland:

i didn't make it because the info line given here was incorrect, or at least
it was inopperative.  so i called up the discovery zone itself, and talked
to some lady.  she said that the party was by invitation only.  i figured
that i was misinformed, but it takes me like an hour and a half to get to
monroville...and i didn't want to risk anything.
anybody else have these problems?

love,
ryu

MELT - rom productions - buffalo, ny - 3/15/96
---------------------------------------------- 

PPBS

so me & jeff & his west side new skool posse (mary & hannah) trekked
it on out to buffalo to check out their slowly rising scene...

DA SPACE

a bit hard to find for out of towners such as ourselves especially w/
all the crazy buffalo one waze but eventually we found it. it wuz at
this small night club in downtown buffalo. small dance floor. small
bar. small basement w/ bar as the 2nd room downstairs.

DA SOUND

apparently we missed it when the main room speakers blew & caught on 
fire..thus..why there wuz no bass for the main room most of the night
and why robbie spun in the downstairs second room instead of the main
room.

DA LIGHTS

lotsa blacklights w/ minimal club style lighting. nothing too special.

DA PEOPLE

1st netter we caught wuz SarahS..woo hoo!..she introduced us to Local
Boy/Jeff & Valiant who i got to dance w/ a li'l. Valiant can keep a
groove! met some kats from long island from Caffeine that wuz thrown
down & a bunch from da 'burgh, one of which - mike, i had a photo of 
from Family Affair. met a few kids from buffalo but for most of the
night felt purdy foreign like i do @ most out of state partys. thank
gawd for SarahS who not only introduced me to alotta people - including
Chad & Patrick (Phat O) & for providing us crash space after the party.

DA MUZIK

hopefully SarahS or one of the other Buffalo kids can do a better 
review of the music cuz i didn't recognize any of the dj's since
they were mostly locals, but i'll make a feeble attempt...

both jeff & i agreed the 1st jungle dj downstairs wuz not up to
par - his tracks seemed old & his mixing wuz off, perhaps we're
just spoiled from dieselboy, titonton, & monochrome!

both jeff & i were a li'l dissapointed w/ gavin hardkiss. i think
he wuz spinning more of the new Softkiss stuff than the ole Hardkiss
tracks we know & luv. granted the west coast style is more laid
back & mello, but i think kids wanted to dance - but the tracks 
were just too slow to do much dancing. so most kids just stood
on the sides & chilled - it wuz great music to listen to tho.

i didn't think i would get to dance at all 'til the last dj in the
main room brought the dance outta me especially when he started
spinning all those sorted tracks - yummy! i wish more dj's would
bust out some of the classic Sorted rekkids especially "Twizzler"
- all kindsa good memories with that track.

APBS 

afterwards SarahS, patrick, chad, & my car load went to visit robbie
@ his hotel room, where i snapped a pic of him in his boxers. so now
i've got photos of two Hardkiss bros in their underwear. the other
wuz scott hardkiss @ the red roof inn after Family Affair. [ to the
members of the stevie t fan club: would u settle for pics of scott
& robbie in their boxers instead of terry? ] then Sarah took us to
some all night diner that had really good milk shakes (but still
nothing beats shakes at Tommys here in Coventry!). & then it wuz
off to her pad where we got to meet Mr. S - real nice guy even offered
us bagels in the morning. oh yah SarahS gets my vote for kewlest 
room, apparently Valiant & some other kid bombed her walls w/ some purdy
nice grapphiti artwork. Valiant u simply hafta meet Sano here in the
216, he's definitely the graphitti king here in Thieveland!

we all crashed out & didn't get up 'til like 5pm. After patrick &
chad went to check out the space sarah wants to throw her party at,
they had to get going. but they were soon replaced w/ Sarah's two
friends from Ithaca off of vrave - whose names escape me. After
getting the tickets, munching on some pizza we ordered, & showering,
it wuz off to toronto...

to be continued in stevie's weekend part two - 241 DOSE (toronto, canada)

well, to address the party that stevie t here reviewed...since i am from
buffalo and loathe a great many things about the scene here, it is home
afterall, and the RoM guys try hard to throw cheap, but fun parties, which
they have done with great success until MELT...yeah, the sound blew...the
asshole owner of the club wouldn't let the RoM guys augment the club's 
old as dirt soundsytem...the RoM guys knew it would blow, and that's why they
wanted to bring in their stuff...mr. club owner said no...well, he asked 
for it, cuz it caught on fire and shorted all the bass out...

as for the lights...not all the lights were used...the last party thrown
here was so phat...all the lights were used...the sound held...amazing party
for the price and location...

the number of people was very small...why?...because this was the weekend
half of buffalo and alot of other schools went home for spring break...
also, it was the day before DOSE...

the music...the first jungle DJ that stevie heard was actually two people...
a-sync, who is actually a good jungle dj, and this guy tim who does an amzing
radio show called essential groove and spins everything groovey...this is why
their set consited of jungle, disco, hip-hop, r-n-b, jazz, and afro-caribbean
beats...tim can't mix at all...but he has a great music collection...their
set was just one big experiment...robbie played a good set in my opinion...
the other dj's were good, but the whole night made up for alot of frustration
on the part of all those involved...

incidentally stevie, thanx for the compliments on my dancing...and that 
shit you saw in sarahs's room was crap...don't look at it...trust me, its 
not nearly a representation of what i do...also, you're a hella cool guy,
and i totally plan on looking you up in clevo on the weekend of the 29th
if that's still ok with you...if not, e-mail me privately ok?...cuz i'll have
a coupla questions...also, sorry i didn't talk to ya as much as i wanted
to...i was a little dazed, tired and sore...next time, it'll be all good...
peace...

241 DOSE TWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY - DOSE - 3/16/96 - toronto, canada
---------------------------------------------------------------- 

PPBS

welp it wuz fun keepin up w/ sarahS on the way to toronto, she's
a fly girl behind the wheel thanx to her radar! she got us there
in no time at all. got to the venue w/o a hitch too.

huge line out front. we followed mary & hannah to the front to see
if we had to wait in line if we had tickets. the commando chica w/
the radio headset sent us back even if we were on the guest list.

apparently everybody had to wait in line to go thru the super
security w/ full pat down, water bottle removal et all. an hour
in line in the cold just to be felt up by some guards, ok. i guess
it wuz better than the two hours before last year's Pleasure Force's
New Year's Party when it wuz even colder out.

me & jeff got in the guest list line right behind the terry mullan 
posse, so that made for a slightly swifter entry.

DA SPACE

as usual toronto production companys always gets the phattest warehouse
spaces and this wuz no exception. the guest list line entered thru the
third room, which wuz still being setup when we walked in at around
12:30am. we walked downstairs & entered the second room, which wuz already
packed w/ a buncha kids dancing to jungle. then u walk out to the main
and u are just overwhelmed by the sheer size of the space - huge w/
50 ft. ceilings - completely packed. i guesstimate there wuz about
4000 kids there that night. it's so crazy coming from cleveland where
u'll never see a party this huge...a bit overwhelming. 

the dj area and the speaker stacks were located on the left. there wuz a
huge video screen over the dj table showing the other partys going on at
the same time in vancouver, denver, and los angeles. there were chill
spaces in the back and on the right w/ smart drinks, mixed tape stands,
sno cones, & other stuff. there wuz even a huge sculptured brain that
people were sitting on in the center.

DA LIGHTS

i thought the lights were perfect, not too flashy - anything more would've
taken from the huge video screen up top which wuz the main focus. even the
fog machine wuz set just right. altho i don't recall seeing any lasers. i
think centrak could've had a field day w/ this space!

DA SOUND 

two huge walls of sound on both sides of the dj booth - adequate. altho
the huge mass of people may have absorbed some of the sound during the
peak hours. still not as loud as VIBRATION or TECHNOSAURUS 2 tho. adequate
sounds in the 2nd & 3rd rooms. altho i think there were a few complaints
about not enuff bass for the 3rd room during the jungle sets up there.

DA PEOPLE

i think the only netter i met there besides SarahS wuz Dan Deliverance,
if there wuz others i wuz the kid w/ the black zett visor - decided to
go w/ ole faithful again. non netters in da howse worth mentioning: met
paul & his ohio wesleyan crew from columbus who i got to dance with for
awhile. also got to throw down w/ this crew from brooklyn - i think they
were a li'l taken aback after my knee spin. but i wuz taken aback when
their leader wanted me to critique their dancing! i don't know what is in
toronto, but i don't think they get too many decent dancers out there.
there wuz actually this small group of rave chicas following me around
watchin me dance. unfortunately that's exactly when i can't dance when
there's too many people watchin'. luckily they dissapeared near the end
of the night. ohh yeah i wuz surprised to see Jinny from Rochester there.
she wuz the one i attempeted to get her keys out of her car after Cherry.
she introduced me to a bunch from Rochester including DJ Pekay. but other
than that almost throught out the whole night i felt like a total foreigner.
it's really strange to go to partys in ohio where u know everybody & their
mother & go to an out of state party & not recognize hardly anybody. what's
worse is when the locals look down upon u for being a foreigner. i even caught
some racial tension - but that goes along w/ all major cities i guess. this 
is why i think when big city ravers come to partys in ohio, they're a li'l
shocked by the hospitality toward out of towners cuz it's not like that
around here...PLUR still exists here & we'd like to keep it that way,
thank u.

another thing i noticed alotta big city kids tend to judge u by how yur
dressed, who yur hanging out with, & who u know. gawd damn next time i'll
hafta bring my prettier but snootier friends, perhaps some of my professional
dancer friends of the adult version, i think jeff & joe know whom i'm
talking about. tee hee, my last two ex-girl friends would've been perfect.
looks that kill & attitudes that do too!

DA MUZIK

DJ DAN - w/ blond hair spun a phenominal two and a half hour set! if u
         have not heard this man spin, by all means go! he along w/ Carlos
         Doc Martin, & Thomas Michael are my fav west coast dj's. for 
         many his set wuz the highlight of the evening. the vibe never
         dropped through out his tremendous set. this set alone made the
         party worth it. he made everybody & their mother dance!

DOMINIK - in the 2nd room. shoot me if i'm wrong cuz i'm not from toronto
          and i don't know the toronto dj's, but i believe DOMINIK wuz the
          dj spinning hardcore in the early on in the 2nd room. alls i can
          say is that it's been so long since i've heard any hardcore as in
          gabber, the stuff i used to spin and to hear it mixed well. i had
          a big ole sm:)e when i walked in during his set!

JOHN E - another set that wuz very dancer friendly and completely packed the
         second room. i think toronto kids don't appreciate their local dj's
         as much cuz they see'em all the time, but believe u me. y'all should
         be proud - this is coming from one from a city whose locals have all
         spun for a year and a half or less!    

VITAMIN D - did anyone see this guy spin? i dunno if i wuz too busy walkin
            around or somethin, but i don't believe ever seeing this guy
            spin in the main room. and he wuz s'posed to be headliner too.

HIPP-E - apparently this dj from denver has been getting booked alot in
         toronto, now i see why. i think Hipp-E came out to cleveland once,
         but our crowds didn't do him justice - a hundred kids just doesn't
         compare to 4000 canooks bouncing to the mad flavas of Hipp-E's
         tracks!

DR TRANCE - smooth trance tracks in the second room. and then when he played
            that new "electric" song - wow - brought the dance outta me!
            later on had a li'l chat w/ the man. looked like this guy has
            been around for quite some time. i wuz kinda surprised when he
            knew that i too had been partying for quite some time - perhaps
            he remembers me from my 1st toronto party w/ hossam in the 
            summer of '93 (or wuz it '92?) where i 1st met damian & joe.
            damn what wuz the name of that party out in the farm field?

TERRY MULLAN - i followed him in so i had to watch him spin! Terry never
         dissapoints he kicked his set of w/ some serious acidic beats and
         never let the crowd rest! call me a no life trainspotter but u
         just gotta watch him when he's scratchin those records up - oooh
         nelly! can u imagine terry & carlos havin a scratchin tag team,
         now there's an idea! hell yah! yup da terry mullan fan club wuz
         in full effect that night and i wuz one of 'em - consider me an
         official member! oooh terry where r u spinning next!

DJ SNEAK - unfortunately i wuz down to one picture left when Sneak came on
           and i had to save it for pepper & kenya so i didn't get a photo
           of Mr. Sneak - hmmm maybe this wuz why his set didn't seem up
           to par, yah whatevah, stevie! actually his set started off pretty
           good but then like SarahS sed it just got slower & slower. perhaps
           he wanted to test some new tracks. i guess here's my answer to
           obin's question on playing for the crowd or playing new tracks.
           i'm gonna say what my mentor the great scott forbush told me
           when i interviewed him: the trait of a better dj is the ability
           to sneak new tracks to the masses by mixing it w/ more 'played'
           dancer friendly tracks. it is after all the job of the dj to mix.
           i guess Sneak just wuzn't 'sneaky' enuff that night.

PETER & TYRONE - from Klubb Kids & 83 West Toronto made up for Sneak's slow
          set in the second with their high energy house - oooh weee! again
          the dance wuz brought outta me after chattin w/ this other dancer
          from pittsburgh i wuz bustin out w/ some purdy trippy moves i
          didn't even know i had in me!

TERRY MULLAN - closed the night out w/ an intense closing set that just
          left the crowd begging for more. it wuz an abrupt ending to an
          unbelievable evening, but all good things have to come to an end.
          after his set they gave away the technics 1200's to some lucky
          ticket holder, lucky bastard, perhaps i should've gotten tix
          after all.

APBS

welp after they gave away the tables, they made everybody get out. i thought
jeff, mary, & hannah were behind me, but i dunno i think they were still
a li'l overwhelmed by the whole thing, i remember my 1st big city party...
it's something u'll remember for the rest of yur life. i think that's why
i like introducing kids into the scene, i want them to get that feeling
too.

after they finally figured out i wuz outside waitin by the car we had to
figure out how to get to pepper & kenyas place. but luckily the direx
they gave us were pretty good & we got there in one piece.

alls i can say about kenya & pepper is that they like the dark. 'bout
tripped & killed myself trying to find my way up their stairs. and of
course chatting w/ 'em in the dark in their room wuz an experience too.
they are true children of the night. it must've been awful for'em when
i flashed'em w/ my camera but that's what i saved my last picture for:
the two very hospitable hosts for our stay in toronto - much appreciated.
and hell yeah when u come to cleveland kenya, i'll be more than willing
to hook u up w/ crash space, whatevah! this goes for any other net
ravers that wanna come check our li'l party scene here in cleveland...
mi casa es su casa.

i picked up a little black and white 2x3 flip book flier for a party in
cleveland on friday night..

all it says is : cleveland/3/22/96/info: 216.651.9637

it flips a swirl of the cover, and the word "shine" inside of it

does anyone have ANY substantial information about this party??

i called the info line, and no answer. i heard there is a party with dan
curtain and sleepy c + other locals, but i do not know if they are the same
parties...

if anyone has any more info..please post it or e me privately...i really want
to be celebrating on the 23rd ;)

I just wanted to say that I got into the party at 10:30pm, and was 
greeted by VITAMIN D's definately worth mentioning set!  He was in the 
Main Room (of course), and he is also one of those DJ's who spin alot of 
shit that you don't hear, too often. I thought this guy was incredible, 
and if you like techno/house, then you should definately look for him on 
future line-ups!!  I thought that his set was the second best of the 
night (DJ DAN being #1 of course:).  

thats it:)

I would really appreciate you posting the details simply because I'm
interested in what you'll be using and also I'd like to see if some of the
Dutch Raves I've been to get close to the output that you'll be having.

-ITO :)


Bassrush, the midwest rush which is to take place in Louisville, Ky on the 
20th of April 1996 at the Palace Theater will have the following sound 
systems.

The main room :

Mid-high cluster : each cluster is composed of a 4080 Gauss 2" titanium driver 
bolted to a Constant Directivity (CD) horn with a 90 * 40 dispersion. The 
midrange (which I helped design the horn when I was in college) is a 12" Gauss 
driver capable of handling 600 watts continuously for 8 hours (eisa norms) 
bolted on a 42 * 42 exponential long throw horn (hand made).
The Bass bin : each one contains 2 Gauss 18" capable of handling each 800 
watts continously for 8 hours. Each bass bin can be feed with more than 1600 
watts continuously or 3200 wats peak. The box is tuned to 43 hz using 2 ports 
of 5" in diameter and 0.83 inch deep. (records rarely reproduce frenquency 
below 40 hz, so why waiste the power)
Those speakers were custom built to my spex by a touring company in TN, and 
they are now using those boxes on their tours.

ok..the main room will have 20 (if i get the last 4 built by then) bass bins 
and 12 clusters. This system will be run in stereo to please the patrons.
The total continuous power handling of those speakers is : 40 640 watts. To 
compare, a household heater eats 1500 watts. You could heat 27 rooms.

The amplification is solely done by Carver. I have tried Crest, Crown, and 
others...they all have failed my requirements. I like Carver because of their 
temperature stability, efficiency, their high slew rate (40 v / micro second), 
power output / weight ratio and their reliability. In 3 years of been pushed 
every weekend for 12 hours non stopin the heat and humidity, only one amp 
failed...I can not say that about crest or crown (which will over heat and 
shut down within 3 hours or just simply die).

Each amp rack has :
-1 input plate using a 19 pin connector to jump the signal from rack to rack
-1 fused output plate to the speakers using electromagnetic fuses and speakon 
outputs connectors
-4 107 cfm fans to cool the amps
-1 Carver PM 600 for the highs
-1 Carver PM 1200 for the mids
-1 Carver PT 2400 for the bass.
Each carver amp has it's own built in limiter for more protection

There will be 5 racks feeding the main system.

The processing rack has :

3 DBX 1531, 31 band 1/3 octave eq, 2 for the main, 1 for the dj monitor
2 TDM 24cx, 24 db / oct xover 3 way stereo, one for the main, one for the 
monitor
4 DBX 166 compressor, 2 for the highs (l+r), 2 for the mids(l+r)
1 DBX 266 dual compressor for the bass.(mono)
1 output plate using a 19 pin connector

this was for the main.

the second room and the third room will have each half of that main system.

I choose Gauss Drivers because :
-they are the only company that make speakers with a double spider (better 
acuracity ---> better sound)
-the power handling (it can take the shit)
-the magnetic structure design
-the rigidity of the cone (some of the drivers were made in 1973 and are still 
working perfect).
-the cleaness of the sound coming out of those drivers.
-the only problem is their prices...quality means big bucks
(if you are interested in purchasing Gauss drivers, I am a dealer for Gauss)

I think it is easy for any sound company to be loud but it is extremely hard 
to be clean. After 6 years of research and tuning, I acheived to reproduce a 
very clean and clear sound. Loudness is not my goal, but clarity is. I get off 
seen ravers enjoying themselves in front of my system. I am proud of it and I 
like to make ravers happy. I don't see any reasons to make someone go deaf and 
/ or make them go away by being too loud.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (Maxximum@msn.com). I will 
be happy to reply to your questions.

PS : I did not put my max slp or db pressure because it is noone's business 
but mine. But I can tell you it is up there.

Hey everyone!
	Here is the updated list I mentioned last week. There are a few 
duplicate names that were on the list last time, but these were the 
ones we still could not find. Again, any help will be greatly 
appreciated. Thank you so much. See everyone at Eclipse in April! (all 
three of us will be there!)
=)

I just got hold of the flier.....

under the lights section :
12 Godlights. hum...This is a big lie. There are one 5 godlights (aka Synchro 
Digital) in the US. 2 in Miami, fl, 1 in California and 2 in Louisville (my 
property). I am a dealer for COEMAR for the whole midwest. 12 godlights...it 
is a lie..false advertising but I guess Spawntaneous is trying anything to get 
people to come.

Also..why 150 dataflashes...those will require 750 amps(where will they get 
the power)..and why put 150 dataflashes in people face when 10 of them hurt. 
Either it is Spawntaneous' stupidity or just a typo.

Also...concerts use 60 to 80 cabinets to power up 25000 - 40000 people....120 
cabinets..hum they must be small and not very efficients...at Technosaurus I 
had 20 cabinets and I was seriously pounding and hurting people with bass 
(remember some people got sick). Lenny Dee at Vortex said that my system was 
the best one he has ever heard..so that means something.


I am just bitching because I don't like ravers to be missled and lied to.

and finaly...with all the lighting gear they are getting :

30 intellabeams rent for $150 a piece (on average)	: $4500
12 Godlights (if they had them) $150		: $1800
24 Trackspot $75				: $1800
150 Dataflashes @ $25				: $3750

					Total : $11850 
and that is just in rental equipement..that does not include labor and 
trucking.
I have never seen a promoter in the midwest willing to pay that much for 
lights.
The max I have seen was $2000.00

This is a logical technical facts I made.....you are the judge.

                                            SLEEPY-C (metamorphic)

...and a bunch of other locals i don't like and don't care to mention...
actually i really don't rememebr because i jsut know that much from the guy
who's putting it on...he told me but that's all i remembered..oh well...i 
believe he said it would be $10..
                                                                                
info #  216.651.9637
====================================================================

dat would be chris pulse   

welp it's friday and i called the info line & all u get is some music,
no dj line-up, no location, no nothing.              

but i will give chris props, like kate sed, the flyer is pretty kewl.
an actual flip book w/ a swirl that changes into words and an "e"
that changes into "shine". most creative flyer in cleveland i've
seen in awhile. dat is till i saw the new 420 flyer. props to kevy
kev for dat one. now if steve just had half the brains to remember
to send'em to me after i just gave him my new address, i could've
distributed'em for him in buffalo & toronto last week. oh welly.

====================================================================== 
neeext.....in the Akron area on Saturday the 23rd of March we have...

                            STARBIRTH

                EARTH                        GANK
                (minneapolis)              (cleveland/spawntaneous)

              DANNYBOY                     FREEZE
              (new jersey)                   (columbus)

and one other name that i can't seem to make out...Anthone maybe?  who knows?

anyway, anyone heard Earth or Dannyboy?  i have no idea if they're worth the
trip so if anyone has any info on that please e-mail me :)


                               info# 216.981.3721
=========================================================================

ahh dis would be Crys Kurkendol's party, one of my ex's. btw i predict
this party will not go well cuz Crys left on bad terms w/ many from 
columbus plus it wuz not well promoted.

yup anthony from columbus, part of the columbus art students posse w/   
sense & animate.

actually earth has spun here before @ a spawntaneous party - RUMBLE,
the party didn't go off too well cuz it wuz on a thursday night &  
announced the party a week before in typical spawntaneous fashion.
but from what i recall, he spun a purdy good set.

hmmm dannyboy, i wonder if this is breaker dan who's shacking up w/
leidra...nahhh!

==========================================================================
saving the best for last....finally on Sunday the 24th of March

Spawntaneous brings you (in true short notice as always)....

                okay, i haven't seen a flyer for this and the info line doesn't
           list one, so i'm going to name it myself :)

                        SCHMAGAGLEMILCH

     featuring a live PA by...
                                AUTECHRE (wax trax/tvt/warped)

     and a dj set by the UK's   MARK BROOM (cosmic)

     as well as set's by locals  SLEEPY-C (metamorphic)

                                      YOPU  (akron?  i can't remember b)
       
               GANK (spawntaneous)


sorry for all you school kiddies, jsut lie to the fam!  it'll be worth it! :)  
you didn't hear that from me though ;)


           info# 216.779.7188
=============================================================================

actually i think this is ROAD TO 420 PART TWO since this is the second
of the series of small partys that are being thrown to help fund 420.

yup dats YOPU aka Ryan Nester from G-Force Productions in Akron. He's
also the one doing that new tuesday night thingy w/ traxx in akron.

ahhh, jeff, alwaze da bad influence. i don't recommend lieing to your
parents. remember what happened to mary in buffalo! instead just don't
tell'em anything. and if they ask when u get home, tell'em the truth:
"i needed to spend some time with my friends, because i've been neglecting
them and they needed me."

=============================================================================
anyone who's on pb-cle raves feel free to foreward this cuz i'm not on it...

besides that, see you at the parties!

yeah, i hate seeing the "free giveaways" from such and such label and 
have never once been given a free record at any party by the promoters or 
label.  just lies and bullshit.  in fact someone who worked the door at a 
ups party told me that he was handed a bag of junk records and told that 
if anyone asked about the free records to give them one of those....  
hmmm, i tend to ignore that stuff as well as "secure venue" and "bust free"
laters trouty....

ummmm, my skool is having some sort of problems with the PPP connections, 
so the cut and paste that i usually do in ~15 minutes took ~1 hr this 
week.  i kept hoping the PPP lines would be back up, but no such luck.  
sigh....
i got a flyer at club joy for something (maybe a group?) called
"strawberries (no meat)"....  before putting the dates on the calendar i 
would like to know what the hay it is!!??  the info # is 873-1823, 
someone in pgh could call for me, as i'm really trying to keep my long 
distance to an absolute minimum.  i'm saving every penny for a car, every 
week something else goes wrong with my death trap!  trouty.....

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

Ok for all of you who want to continue to rip on this party. I know for a
fact that the space they have is secured and is bust free. What all of you
have failed to mention is that psychoactive is also throwing this party with
spawntaneous. If you don't want to support it than just don't support it but
for god sakes stop trying to influence anyones mind....

***ok, i see my post is being taken out of context.  where did i use the 
phrases about "bust free" and "secured venue" bit in the context of 420?  
no, i said i'm sick of false advertising in general.  the only direct 
implications to anyone directly were to ups who told someone to hand out 
records.  ****PLEASE *READ* MESSAGES (and understand what is being said) 
BEFORE REPLYING**** i assume you're from mw-raves?  damn, i see things 
havent changed one bit on that list since i dropped it due to the same 
bickering and fighting...  *sigh*   .....    flame suit on-->trouty....

Hello people!

Do you happen to know if Prodigy's Firestarter single is in Pittsburgh?
I know it is out.
And do you have any information on other releases?

Thanks
Aristotelis

***ok, i see my post is being taken out of context.  where did i use the 
phrases about "bust free" and "secured venue" bit in the context of 420?  
no, i said i'm sick of false advertising in general.  the only direct 
implications to anyone directly were to ups who told someone to hand out 
records.  ****PLEASE *READ* MESSAGES (and understand what is being said) 
BEFORE REPLYING**** i assume you're from mw-raves?  damn, i see things 
havent changed one bit on that list since i dropped it due to the same 
bickering and fighting...  *sigh*   .....    flame suit on-->trouty....
===================================================================

chill jamie...actually kevin aka dj fuzz wuz responding to frenche's
post, it had nothing to do with yur post. actually as far as i know,
kevin is not on mw-raves and is only on ne-raves. but yur wrong about
mw-raves, there are alotta good kids left that still believe in plur
on there. i'm one of them. u'll get big ego'ed know it alls w/ no
concept of common respect on all lists, but eventually even they get
a clue. it's called maturity. and i've seen all the lists mature alot
since i've gotten on. that's what the internet is for, it's a common
ground where people from all corners can voice their opinion and learn
from each other and hopefully not only gain a little knowledge but
gain a better appreciation and respect for something or someone they
didn't know that much about when they first got on. 

as far as this 420 mudslinging thing. i really think it is unnecessary.
i think both parties will be the bomb regardless of how many lights will be
there (don't tell chip i said this), cuz the line-up for both partys are
so phat (damn i can't believe i'm still saying that word). i did talk w/
both steve & chris and i think the thing people are forgetting is the
space they're having the party at is huuuuge! we're talking three story
mega-warehouse here and all the lights and all the power is being divided
into three. and as far as doubts concerning the amount of money it would
take for all the equipment - yur right the party is going to be very
expensive - $70,000 according to steve, this is exactly why they've 
thrown a party every week the past two weeks to help pay for 'the big one'.
and as far as the complaint about the size of the 420 flyer, alls i can
say is just not too long ago people were making fun of how lame the
cleveland flyers were. so steve said: fine i'll put out a dope ass flyer
for 420, hooked up w/ kevy kev and did it. and now people are complaining
that it's too nice / too big - whatevah!

i think the bottom line is the two partys are pretty far apart. it's two
different scenes...two different crowds. the people up north will go to
cleveland. the people down south will go to louisville. personally like
i said before i wish they all could've combined it all into one huge 
super party in columbus or something, but i know that's impossible...or
is it? oh well...dream a li'l dream stevie! (i luv talkin to myself!)

Hey whats up,

  I just read about your sound system but, I'm much much more of a light guy.
 So do you think you can give me a lowdown of the lights your sporting?

Well
thats all.... Write back ok :)

For Bassrush, midwest rush, april 20th 1996 in Lousiville KY.

This is the 18th request for details...so I guess I better do it.

The lighting desigh will be done by Eyegasm and programmed by Eyegasm

The lighting is composed of :

-4 to 8 High End System Intellabeams 700 Hx
	12 colors, 12 dichros, 700 watts MSR lamp
-8 Mini Ultra Scan 200 MSD by TAS (italy)
	1 colors, 1 dichros, 200 watts MSD lamp
-4 High End System Track Spot
	8 colors, 8 dichors, 250 watts EHJ lamp
-2 Ultra Scan 700 by TAS
	12 colors, 12 dichros, 700 watts MSR lamp
-15 Dataflashes by High End Systems
	1000 watts, 16 fps
-2 to 4 Vipers by High End systems
	450 milliwatts dual beam lasers
-2 Synchro Digital 575 (aka Godlight, THE only 2 in the midwest)
	by Coemar (italy)
	575 HMI lamp, 5 color, 8 mirror
-4 Emulator by High End Systems
	12 colors, 12 dichros, 375 HMI lamp

The High End system gear will be programmed and controlled during the event by 
Eyegasm. The Tas and Coemar gear will be programmed by myself but controlled 
by eyegasm during the event.

IMHO, it is not the amount of intelligent fixtures you put up that counts. 
What is important is their placement and who programs them. You could have a 
shit load of light put at the wrong places and programmed wrong, the show will 
look like shit. The key is programs. The Ld (light designer) is very well know 
in the lighting industry, not just the rave scene, across the whole US. He 
worked for High End Systems, Coemar and TAS. He knows every lights and 
controler inside out which give him the upper hand on programming. He also 
design some of the biggest night club in New york and many other places.

Some people asked me why Intellabeams are so used.
IMHO, Intellabeams are known because of their versatility and their road 
readyness. When I purchase lighting gear, I pay attention to :
-1- versatility
-2- road ready ness
-3- accuraty of the optics
-4- reliablility and maintenance
I don't care about the price when it comes to buying gear. Cheap stuff won't 
get you anywhere (ei Peavey or American DJ). If something is cheap, it is not 
well built and/or designed. I can't afford down time on my gear.

well enough of boring technical stuff. (sorry, I am an Industrial Eng.)

just wanted to explain again about this event.  it's NOT a rave, it's a 
live event, with live techno performances, and it starts EARLY (8.30 PM) 
so get there on time or you'll miss it!  it's $2 to get in but just so 
you know, that money goes to pay for the space rental.  all the musicians 
are playing for free.  in fact one of them, jeff central, hasnt played 
out in almost 3 years, so it WILL be worth it (trust me!).  

it wont be all serious, either...because (Li) will be followed immediately by
another free jungle/breaks house party, called perSuaSive pErCuSsion vol 4
(location disclosed only at the concert!). the location of the concert 
itself is given below, along with directions to it at the end of the post.

**

DIRECTIONS TO CAFE Q:

from the north: take I-71 down to columbus and get off at the 5TH AVE 
exit (exit 110), and take a RIGHT.  go WEST until you see high st.  you want 
to go LEFT but don't turn at that light (it's illegal), instead, go 
through the gas station (or figure something else out), then go SOUTH on 
high st for one block, look for 1175 and that's it!

from the south: take I-71 up to columbus, to the 11TH AVE exit (exit 111). 
then take a RIGHT on 11th, then a RIGHT at the 1st light (CLEVELAND AVE).
go down about a mile to 5TH AVE, take a RIGHT, then go another mile to
HIGH ST, and find 1175 n high st to the LEFT.  be careful at the
intersection of high and 5th ave because you are not supposed to take a
left there altho that's the direction you need to go.  go through the gas
station or find some way around that light (unless you want to risk it). 

from the west: take 70 E to columbus, then find 71 N and follow 
directions from the south.

from the east: take 70 W to columbus, find 71 N and follow directions 
from south.

hope you all can make it!

This upcoming summer has the capacity to be the 'Summer of Love' all over
again, but this time not just for hippies, but everyone from all walks of
life.  This is why we, The FreeBass Collective, want to try a new thing.
We want to travel across the U.S. this summer and throw FREE parties in
conjuction with promoters, dj's, and anyone interested in helping out, in
thier respective geographical areas.  I cannot emphasize enough that these
will be FREE raves, this means the costs must be kept minimal, but yet
enough to make it a memorable experience, and the cost of these parties
will be upon those involved.  Lets give back to the scene all that we have
gotten out of it.  What we were thinking were 2-3 day campouts for each
rave.  The volunteers from the host geographical areas would be responsible
for site selection, promotions, local dj talent, and any sound or lighting
that could be afforded.  Us, The FreeBass Collective, will be traveling
with our sound system, hopefully a full-size tent, a collection of our own
dj's that would be voluntering for the trip, and lots of motivation.  We
already have plans to setup at several Rainbow Gatherings and have a
southern california/arizona party in the works (so far in conjunction with
BioHazard Productions, props to Thee-O).  We would probably want to have
these parties, of course, fall on weekends (either starting on Friday or
Saturday).  We, The FreeBass Collective, would be arriving in your area
around monday or tuesday to meet and get to know all volunteering factions
and to start getting set-up.

Right now this is just in the planning stages so we wanted to know how many
and where people were interested in doing this.  So if you could write me
back, give me the name of your productions company, or if a dj or an
individual your name, your geographical area, what you can do to support
this venture, and snail mail address and phone number.

We can be contacted at the following address:

Subject: 	Frenche's sound system

This question might be important to anyone going to Bassrush...

Should ear protection be worn when listening to the sound system?  I've
heard all kinds of wonderful things about frenche's system.  I also
heard that distortion is the cause of ear damage.  If frenche's
system is clean, does that mean that I don't need to protect my hearing?

Can't wait to feel that bass!!!

---ben / Cylert


Ben and dear fellow techno lovers....I  could write a book about this...there 
are so many factors involded in ear damage.

I am going to make it short and i will probably forget a few thing (my memory 
is not that good anymore).

Hearing loss is due to :
-duration. this is the most inportant (IMHO). According to OSHA here is the 
Daily permissible noise exposure. 
Duration (hr)		Sound level (dBA)	Example

8			90			passing truck
6			95			home stero
2			100			Subway train @ 20ft
1			110			sound at a rave at 100	ft
0.25			115			"   "    "   at 20 ft
0.01			135			Jet airplaine w/ after burner

At 135 db, you start losing your hearing after 6 minutes. Basically, not 
matter who is doing the sound, you WILL lose your hearing. proof...I am 
death..that is why I don't like to talk on the phone.

-sex. if you are a female, you hearing is more sensitivve on the 2000 hz-18000 
hz. you will loose hearing (accuracy)

-risk contours. an human ear is 15 db more sensitive at 1 kHz that at 100 hz. 
The bass will do a lot less damage on your ears that the highs. BYW Bass is 
from 20 hz to 80 hz...mid...80 to 1000 hz, high from 1000 hz to 18 000. Most 
of us cannot hear (if you are around 20-25 years old) frequencies above 16 000 
hz..so when you see a speaker saying 20 hz to 30 000 hz...it is bs.
130 db of 100 hz to 300 hz of pure tone is the max your ear can tolerance. 115 
db of 2000 hz to 4000 hz of pure tone is  the max your ear can take. 125 db of 
6 000 to 18 000 of pure tone is the max your ear will take.

-drugs. they affect you hearing. I don't know much about this since there is 
no data on this domain, but from experience, I can say that some drugs, (e) 
will prevent some hearing damage by changing the electric flow from your ear 
drum to your brain.....but don't take this for granted...I don't know.

-distortion...it is bad for your ears and the equipement. 10 watts of 
distortion can distroy a tweeter so imagine what it can do to your ear.

-the acoustic of the building...some building confuse your ears because of 
standing waves and reverberation. To much of it decreases your daily maximum 
exposure

Now about how I designed my system. Most companies (EV..EAW...BOse...Meyer) 
design their speakers using digital equipement. I don't beleive in that 
because, we humans,  are the ones listening and enjoying music through our own 
ears not digital gear. I use the specs of an human ear, the audibility curve 
in a man and a woman and also the threshold of pain curve  to design the 
system. Which means, I turn down the frequencies that your ear is the most 
sensitive to and I turn up the frequencies that would do less damage. So 
basically what you hear is flat..well almost because women can hear the highs 
better than men, so I kind of made an average between the two sexes. Also to 
help prevent the hearing loss on the highs, I am using CD horns and CD 
crossover (CD : Constant Directivity) to prevent concentration of high is a 
certain direction. 

Also, I don't believe in extremely loud sound systems. I don't like when my 
ears are hurting. I love music (not just techno) and I like to feel it with my 
ears and my body. my goal is to please the ear not to hurt them. I don't get 
pleasure in front of an ear percing Sound system. This is why I don't turn my 
system up to full power. and this is also why I tell dj's not to go in the red 
(distortion) because I want a clear sound to come out the speaker. Music is so 
beautiful when it comes out clean and clear.

Last, this is for the DJ...any DJ that goes +6 or more on the mixing board LED 
meter (this is in the red all the way) more than twice will NEVER spin on my 
system again. Two well known DJs are banned from my system. I enforce this 
rules all the time and there are no exceptions. I do this to protect my gear. 
(and people hearing too)

I forgot...yes do wear ear protection...please...do. Hearing loss is 
PERMANENT. did you hear that Terry Mullan and Chip B

Ps : screw my spelling, I am french...I am per mite ed two mis pell.

i just thought i'd comment on some of this, based on what i've learned in
class and what i found in Guyton's med. phys. book...

i wouldn't believe this.  1) damage is caused by air pressure waves (sound)
of such great amplitude that the hair cells, and possibly the associated
nerve endings, are damaged due to excess vibration of the basilar membrane
in which they reside.  as long as the membrane is vibrated with enough
intensity, damage is possible.  the arguement that distortion causes damage
seems unreasonable since distortion is just "clipping" of otherwise smooth
sine waves of sound.  also, since any signal or wave (even a clipped or
distorted signal) can be decomposed into a (large) number of perfect sine
waves of different frequencies and amplitudes, it seems unreasonable that
these waves obtain any special characteristics that would cause ear damage
when "clean" sound wouldn't.  ok, maybe the clipped waves carry more high
frequency components (needed to form the corners in the clipped waves) than
does the corresponding "clean" wave, but i don't see this as the cause of
the destruction.  there is plenty of high frequency sound in the music to
cause deafness before the distortion would play a significant role.  higher
frequencies which we can't hear cannot cause deafness because they don't
vibrate the basilar membrane (that's why we can't hear them).     *gasp*
say that all in one breath.  am i making sense?  
RECAP: distortion is just another sound wave and causes no more damage than
clean music.             
  

>-drugs. they affect you hearing. I don't know much about this since there is

i could imagine that (e) or any stimulant/depressant/etc would change the
conduction of nerve pulses to the brain, so it might not feel like your ears
are being damaged when you're under the influence.  it won't prevent damage
of the mechanical transduction system though- hair cells, membranes, etc.    


>-distortion...it is bad for your ears and the equipement. 10 watts of

i don't think it's relavent to compare sound generation and detection by the
ear...but the point is clear:  be careful with your ears.

werd.  and please don't abandon the earplugs- just because the system is
said to be clean, i wouldn't go without plugs...especially if you plan on
taking drugs.  
if anyone has anything to add/argue- please post.  i'd like to hear it.

=================================================================

terry's on the list?! hey terry, this is stevie yur #1 fan, i need
a photo of u spinning in yur boxers (hmm maybe we can have terry
on the front cover of the next PLRM instead of jeff now, sorry
jeff u've been replaced (like michael) - u just don't look as fly
in yur boxers as terry duz even w/ yur 'morning wood').

btw trevor r u on the plrm mailing list yet? i think we tried to
put u on but u change e-mail addys more often than jeff changes
his boxers (gawd me thinx jeff's gonna kick my ass w/ his burnt
new asics when he comes by to go to Deep today). if not e-mail
gil at: star@interaccess.com & he'll hook u up. this goes out to
anybody else reading this in cyberland, if u feel like getting       
involved w/ something that will give back to the scene via a 
small (but growing) rave zine, e-mail star* & he'll throw u on                 
the plrm mailing list so u can get involved.

oh yah trevor & anyone else who wants to respond to any one of my
posts, don't send yur response to my e-mail addy (syt@po.cwru.edu)
cuz it's got a reputation for bouncing cuz my server sux big time,
instead send yur replys to: plrm@cat.net, that's the plrm mailing
address.

& now back to yur regularly scheduled massive cover flames...

yeah i will be there for sure, i got my presale ticket a while ago...the
tickets look really cool btw.  i've talked to a lot of people who plan on
going too.  i don't see why a lot of people are criticizing this party,
there's lots of parties that have very expensive flashy flyers...at least
420 has a killer lineup to go with it.  plus i've never been to a
spawntaneous or psychoactive event that got busted.  as far as the lights
and sound go, i don't know if what the flyer says is completely true, but i
do know that spawntaneous parties always have amazing visuals and sound, so
i doubt that people will be disapointed.  oh well, like people have said, i
guess it depends where you live, 420 is 20 minutes from here so i will be
there.  plus i really want to see dubtribe live again.  hopefully everyone
will have fun at all the parties that day...

i had the (li) party one way and someone sent me a correction on it, i 
didn't look either one over, but put the correction in.  i dont know the 
difference, but if you're going, you'd be best off to call the ele mental
info line for all the details.

umm here it is....

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.txt and should be found on the 
PB-CLE homepage as well.

Joe was advertising our nifty little media exposure... ;)

Well, the article is PHAT as they say :) However, it very well could
have ruined my family life... Let me explain... What we have here is a
case of situational irony, and not that silly Morrishit ironic
thang... Ok, here's the story... I started smoking about a year ago...
Did it mostly at raves, coffee houses, etc... Wasn't a "smoker"
Another important thing to know is that my parents HATE smoking, HATE
is too nice a word for how they feel about it actually... Not only
that but my Grandfather died (indirectly) because of his smoking
habit (among many other bad habits) My rents didn't know I smoked...
Well, after this one party I got really sick cuz I had smoked too many
cigarettes and then drove home all hyped up on nicotine and got
carsick and threw up... Ok, so I decided I was gonna slow down on the
cigarettes.  Then there was this party in pittsburgh 5 weeks ago
today... The party where the pictures were taken for the article in
todays paper... That was the last time I had a cigarette.  I haven't
smoked a cigarette in five weeks and I feel GREAT... It does take a
lot of will power though... Now to get to the sickeningly ironic twist
to this entire story... The party in the article in the paper was
nice.  It was that night when I decided to quit smoking.  There were
reporters and photographers at the party, because they were writing
the article... Well, today Marcus (Proby on vrave and 1/3 of the Radiance
Organization)  called me and reminded me about the article... So, I
had to go pick up my dad at the airport, and I thought I'd get a copy
of the paper so I could read the article while I waited for his flight
to come in.  I got out of the car this morning, walked over to the
paper machine, plopped two quarters in, and grabbed a Pittsburgh Post
Gazette.... Opening up to the magazine section, after seating myself
comfortably in a chair, I took a quick glance at the cover of the
mag... Who did I see but me and Chris (the Starchild) ripping shit up
on the dancefloor!  Then I took a closer look at these two ravers on
the cover... My hand was covering my face, and in the other hand I
held, you guessed it a CIGARETTE... Thats right, the LAST time I ever
had a cigarette just happened to be caught on film for all of
pittsburgh to see.  Well, I just about died... What if my parents see
it!? It only gets better kids... My dad's plane arrived and he came
into the terminal... We had our usual hey whats up how was your trip
waiting for his bags talk, and then he said "oh I have something for
you!"  He pulled out of his briefcase a copy of the magazine
section... I said oh I've already seen it... He said oh... I said did
you see who is on the cover?  He looked and said no, who is it? I said
thats ME *pointing*  He studied it carefully... Oh, I didn't even
notice... Well, hopefully my tabacco hating dad won't even notice the
CIGARETTE in my hand... :0  Then later on this afternoon he said, I'm
glad you got a copy, cuz I'm sure your mom will want to see it...
Well, if he didn't see the fag in my hand, I'm sure my mom will
recognize me AND the square I was about to puff on... ERMPH.  I just
hope I can make it to Fantastic tomorrow night BEFORE the big
confrontation that will ensue... So, thanks for reading all this, I
just needed to vent :) Irony is bitter, and not even slightly sweet...
:( ok, later  -me

Here's the first page of it, bro.  I'll get the other two finished

Welcome to the Jungle
The rave scene just keeps getting hotter - page 14

[cover]
Jungle Fever!
Far from a fad, the city's rave scene just keeps getting friendlier
By Stephanie Alarcon
Post-Gazette Staff Writer

Amid epileptic strobes and music for a new millennium, a community of 
kids dances and provides for itself.  They keep vampires' hours, flowing 
spryly, feet barely touching the ground.  The ideology, somewhere between 
Sunday school family values and punk rock anarchy, stresses 'PLUR" - 
peace, love, unity, and respect.  They don't discriminate by race, 
gender, faith or politics.  Just attitude.

This dance party culture of teens and twentysomethings feels, at turns, 
like a civic group, family reunion, or party-prone Martian regime.  It si 
a rebellion against boredom and the status quo, pop-star-idol worship and 
a litany of 'isms the kids find inherently uncool.  It is a dreamer's 
dream and a conservative's nightmare.

It is Pittsburgh's growing rave scene.

You've heard the hype, mostly negative, about hoards of uynchaperoned 
youths dancing all night to loud music in fields, warehouses, and even 
the Corliss Tunnel.  You've seen the kids, the weird lookin' ones with 
baggy clothes and shiny piercings.  Maybe you've heard the music, booming 
with drum and bass, quick and electronic squiggles.

But unless you're young and weird lookin', chances are you havn't seen it 
up close.  Raves have been painted as hi-tech dens of sin and designer 
drugs, but ravers argue it's just friends gathering to dance to music 
they love.

Pittsburgh's rave scene is medium-sized and friendly like the city, 
gaining strength, respect, and an identity.  This is a look through the 
eyes of a DJ, a musician and a promotion team.  Ranking their importance 
is like finding the beginning of a circle, but we'll start with a DJ, who 
keeps the circle spinning.

SPIN THE BLACK CIRCLE

Spinning records is a skill and art, and 23-year old Damian Higgins, DJ 
Dieselboy, is Pittsburgh's Michaelangelo on the turntables.  Hovering 
over them by steady candlelight in a flurry of lasers, he looks stoic and 
menacing.  Lounging on the floor of his immaculate Shadyside apartment 
among kung fu and "Star Wars" posters and 2,000 records stored neatly in 
crates, he is considerably less intimidating.  But this understated 
perfectionist stays cool.

He makes satin movements that echo the circular flow of the turning 
records.  His balletic sleight of hand can put down a record, turn the 
power on and adjust the speed in one efficient sweep.  Part surgeon, part 
wizard, he calmly pores over the bass-heavy brew adding a sample here, a 
scratch there, a tiny bit of speed to the mix.

He speaks so openly of his craft, you don't realize his secrets are 
safely tucked away.  "Basically, the object is to smooth the mix between 
the records so that it's unnoticable."

This isn't like DJing for a wedding or high school dance, which requires 
little more than knowing when to push play.  Higgins' skill is manual, 
musical, and even psychological.  The art is in building a 90-minute set 
that sounds like a continuous song.  A DJ's fluidity and music choice 
match and manipulate the dancers' moods to keep them moving until dawn.

Rave music's semi-mythical roots reach back to the mid-1980s Chicago and 
Detroit club scenes.  The culture has since spawned countless 
subcategories of elctronic dance music in the U.S. and U.K. from funky 
house to hypnotic trance to seductive trip-hop.

Higgin's specialty is U.K. breakbeat or jungle, a meticulously disjointed 
often-reggae-influenced music.  On the treble end, machine gun snare 
drums careen out of control and in time, while deep ragga bass lines 
rumble below.

Higgins has earned the title "U.S. Jungle King" locally and nationally.  
Frankie Bones, "the godfather of the rave scene on the East Coast," 
called him one of the two best jungle DJs in the country.  He has also 
produced original tracks in the States and England.

Higgins does not play songs as much as he "constructs" as set.  Early 
morning calls for "laid back, jazzy, deep jungle, while the peak of a 
party "can be high energy; 1 to 2, 2 to 3, I'll pull harder stuff."

Vinyl records are the standard over CD's slightly better - if colder - 
sound quality.  "With vinyl, your hands are making contact with the 
medium you're playing.  You have more control over what you're doing."

Higgin's father, Bertie, is musical as well.  A drummer, singer and 
songwriter, he had a 1982 top-40 hit called "Key Largo," inspired by the 
Bogart/Bacall film.

Higgins grew up in Florida and Colorado.  He went to high school about 
100 miles north of Pittsburgh before studying information science at 
Pitt.  A fan of hip-hop, alternative and industrial, not to mention a 
former breakdancer and drummer, he got his first taste of techno as a 
sophmore there in late 1991.  Around that time, Pittsburgh rave pioneer 
Deadly Buda was throwing the first parties.

Higgins threw three house parties through which he met the "Techno 
Terrorists," Matt Drown and Sean Goller.  They invited him to spin on 
their show on WCRT, Carnegie Mellon's radio station, where he stayed for 
six months.  Progress was slow - and the pay less than stellar - as he 
got hired for local and regional gigs.

Meanwhile, his performances and mix tapes earned praise among the ravers 
on teh Internet who got the word out about this up-and-coming talent.  By 
April 1994, he was spinning every weekend.  Later that year, Higgins 
teamed up with new prompters UnDerground Inc. (UDG), now a major force on 
the scene.  He gave UDG advice and they gave him booking at all their 
events.  Now he performs at parties across the country.

Higgins by no means considers himself famous, but sometimes he's reminded 
of how well-known he is on the scene.  "I'll have some raver ask for my 
autograph or come up to me and say, 'I love you' and hug me then run away."

He recently joined the "bizarre world of the 9-to-5 workforce" at 
Telerama, a local Internet access provider.  But he sees DJing as an 
integral part of his life whether it lasts six months or 10 years.

READY TO RAVE
Raves are not advertised through traditional means, but through info 
lines, flyers, Internet communication, and word-of-mouth.

This tradition of secrecy dates back several years when most parties were 
illegal, but has evolved,more or less, into an effor to keep the scene in 
the hands of the dedicated.  Sometimes it takes some investigation to 
find out what's going on.

For information on upcoming parties, call UDG at 734-1467 or Snap Crackle 
Pop Productions 734-8457.  Call or keep an eye out for fliers (WINK 
WINK!) at local coffeehouses, record stores, and pop culture retailers 
like Collector's 12 Ince (682-4033) and Teleropa (621-2144), both in 
Oakland, Slacker on the South Side (391-3911), and the Strip Bar in the 
Strip District (471-1043).

Club events don't have quite the same spirit (Really?  -Bryce) and are 
usually 21 and over, but many of the DJs are quality.  Check out Cloud 
Nine, Metropol, and Kaya, all in the Strip District, and Club Joy and 
Pegasus, both Downtown, for upcoming events.
