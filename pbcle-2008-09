*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM

	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

The New Ascension, B.A.D Ass., TSK & Kandi Rayne Ent. in 
Associationciation with Jam Solid Productions
Presents

The first music matters jumped of in a semi-renovated underground space 
called "the church". There was a good mix of people from Cleveland, 
Akron and PA the vibe of the night was absolutely amazing and will stand 
out in the memories of those who attended. Come experience the expansion 
of that idea and mood with all of us at...

Music Matters 2

Hosted by Mc Infinity and The New Ascension

Music Matters 2 Stage

Lea Luna Englewood, CO
East Music/Tascam/Skull Candy

Electro-house goddess DJ Lea Luna has been on the up-and-up since 1999, 
rocking many a crowd from underground to commercial, across the US and 
abroad. Her white-hot enthusiasm on stage and in the studio reflects her 
9 year career, which has been gaining exponential momentum since she 
first stepped up to the decks as a tiny teen. "I'm taking my music 
further this year than I ever thought I would have when I first started 
spinning records. Its unreal how many different avenues there are inside 
electronic music: how many subcultures, how many diversely beautiful 
artists, fans and enthusiasts there are. After having the privilege of 
exploring this world and the music in it, I've become a pioneer. I'm 
writing, collecting, and spinning styles that don't even have names to 
them yet. This is truly a divine epiphany, and it's redirecting my 
course in life as a professional musician." She has had numerous 
solely-featured event ads, interviews, and blurbs hailing her appearance 
in dozens of US cities, as well as magazine, billboard, tour guide, and 
television representation overseas. Her broadcasts include internet 
radio Teklab. fm racking up millions of listeners worldwide, 
Clearchannel's Denver-based 93.3 FM, KGNU Boulder, and a past history of 
college radio at UCLA and Metro State University in Denver. "Love and 
music are the only universal languages, and I speak them both so 
fluently and intermittently."-Lea Luna

Eric D
Eric began playing around at his friends' houses on their turntables in 
1993. He started playing out in 1994, and quickly got into promoting 
when he threw his first night at a venue in Pittsburgh, circa 1996. 
Having been a major part of the underground movement, he was involved in 
throwing the "Renegade" parties under the West End Bridge by the river. 
He was 1/2 of N'Sync Productions, having thrown one of Pittsburgh's most 
monumental events, "Journey To Delphi" back in 1996. By 1997, along with 
others, he formed the 412 Collective, which continued to throw 
consistently good events.
Moving to Columbus, Ohio in 1998, he was responsible for the "Kikit" 
parties, as well as "Escalate" Tuesdays and "In Motion" Wednesdays, 
showcasing the best and up and coming local and regional talent. If you 
were in the scene back in the mid to late nineties to the turn of the 
new millenium, you probably heard Eric's unique style at events like The 
Family Affair festivals, Transformations 1 and 3, Revolutions 1 and 2, 
and many other one off events during that time. Last year he made his 
return, playing in Ohio at Family Affair 6 once again, for the first 
time since 2001. Once again, we're proud to bring you the sound of the 
dj... Eric D.
Since the start of his dj career in 1994, he has been rocking many 
dancefloors from Washington, D.C. to Kansas City, and everywhere in 
between. Coming to us from his residency at Vue Ultralounge in Georgia 
he's ready to bring it to the 216 once again. His style has gone through 
many changes with the times, but one thing remains constant - The 
relentless flow of energy throughout his sets. Consistently bringing 
blends of many different genres, knowing what you're going to hear next 
is almost impossible. His signature style of smooth, flawless mixing is 
not to be missed; you're definitely going to want to be on the floor for 
this one.

Sat Sep 06                         DEVIANT                        Cleveland

Deviant, aka David Christopher, began playing his tripped-out blend of 
deep progressive house in 1998 at venues throughout New York City, 
including Vinyl, Limelight, Roxy, and Cheetah. In 2000, Deviant founded 
HeadRush Music, a promotions company that pioneered the use of online 
and e-mail event marketing in New York City. In 2003, following a move 
to Cleveland, Ohio, and with the addition of partner Amy Dana, HeadRush 
Music continued its mission to spread progressive music to progressive 
minds.

In 2004, Deviant and Amy founded Toes in the Sand Recordings, which has 
grown into one of the world's most respected progressive labels. Toes 
started off with a bang, with their first release, "Bound for Ascension" 
by Michael Lanning, appearing on Anthony Pappa's Balance 006. Since 
then, the label has been committed to exposing the globe's best 
underground talent, including Siberian Son, Alican & Soner, DJ Tarkan, 
Andrew K, Naveen G, The Last Atlant, Elusive, Johan Vermeulen, and Pablo 
Roma.

In 2006, Deviant shifted HeadRush Music's focus from events to a second 
record label, focusing on edgier, deeper sounds that didn't quite fit on 
the more melodic Toes in the Sand. The new label features veteran 
artists like RND( ) and Nick Hogendoorn, as well as up-and-comers like 
DownKill, Peter Corvaia, and Rob Curtis.

As a DJ, Deviant's late-night sound has been the perfect finish during 
closing sets for Sean Cusick, Steve Porter, Hybrid, John Howard, Jerry 
Bonham, Mazi, Randall Jones, Habersham, and Thomas Penton, helping him 
twice earn the Cleveland Music Award for Best DJ. He has also proven his 
ability to warm up the dance floor, opening for Sandra Collins, BT, Max 
Graham, Jondi & Spesh, Tim Skinner, Trendroid, Austin Leeds, Micro, Noel 
Sanger, Three, Steve Gerrard, John Howard, George Acosta, and Pete Moss. 
Deviant has also played the headliner role at events in San Francisco, 
Miami, NYC, Orlando, Louisville, Syracuse, and Pittsburgh, and even spun 
on Cleveland's FOX Morning Show to promote Paul Van Dyk's Rock the Vote 
event and HeadRush Music's Get Your Vote Out event with Dennis Kucinich.

In August 2004, Deviant's contributions to the American dance music 
scene led to an invitation to join the Balance Record Pool, a 
hand-picked collective of the top 40 North American DJs, including Chris 
Fortier, Jimmy Van M, Sandra Collins, D:Fuse, and Deepsky.

Following through on HeadRush's commitment to getting underground music 
to the masses, Deviant actively participates in numerous radio shows 
around the world. Despite not being a trance DJ, Deviant appeared on 
SIRIUS Satellite Radio's "The Peak Hour with Victor Dinaire," putting 
him in the company of past guests like Paul van Dyk and Ferry Corsten. 
Deviant has also appeared on ProtonRadio.com, FriskyRadio.com, Galaxie 
95.3 FM France, EccentricBeats.com, Rotationz.be, Beatfactor.net, and on 
FM radio from Argentina to Belgium. Deviant currently hosts the Toes in 
the Sand radio show on Proton Radio.

Deviant has been creating music since 1992, long before he ever stepped 
up to a turntable, drawing his influences from across the musical 
spectrum to create songs (and DJ sets) that defy typical dance-music 
formulas. His last release, "That Marijuana Track," was the #5 top 
seller at EDMDigital.com. He also remixed Jairus Miller's "Cobra" for 
Infamous Light Recordings, Brahma's "Peaks of Destiny" on Toes in the 
Sand Recordings, and is currently hard at work on other remixes and 
original tracks.

Sat Sep 13                      WRONG TURN 2             Yellow Springs, OH

NURAWTEK ENTERTAINMENT AND SLOPPY CINCY ARE AT IT AGAIN!!!!

at:

Feeding The Vibe:

CEREAL KILLAZ
The Cereal Killaz is Washington, DC area breakbeat/drum n bass act 
created in 2005, headed up by the mastermind producer, songwriter, & 
multi instrumentalist - [zarbizarre]. With elements of Nu Metal, Florida 
and UK Breaks, Drum n Bass, Industrial and Indie Rock, the sound can be 
described as hard hitting, with gut wrenching bass, heavy hitting drums, 
and nasty distorted synths and guitars that make you want to chew your 
face off.

The act has performed at events all over the US and Europe, with several 
heavy hitters in the electronic music scene, including: Deekline, 
Ctrl+Z, Aut0b0ts, Noisia, Baobinga, Mephisto Odyssey, Breakfastaz, 
Hyper, Dynamix II, Frankie Bones, Keoki, Dopamine, Krafty Kuts, Scott 
Henry, The Rogue Element, Annalyze, Reid Speed, Simply Jeff, Baby Anne 
and many more, and has been the only American act to perform at the 
Breakspoll International Breakbeat Awards, held at the superclub, 
Fabric, in London, UK (Feb 2007).

.... conceptually apart from the average nu skool ... innovative 
breakbeat .... - Mike Hogan, owner of Breakspoll - from review of the 
single, .Reality.
.Disturbing, in a good way.

. - Carl Loben, DJ MAG, May 2006


As a DJ act, Cereal Killaz / [zarbizarre] is one of the few breakbeat 
DJ's who practices harmonic mixing - the technique of mixing different 
keys artistically, instead of randomly, in order to create musical 
blends rather than bland or sour mixes.


GEIN
GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin pyscho Edward. 
Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant), Abel and Saint 
(founder of Habit Recordings). Formed in early 2004, the crew linked up 
when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel 
to create one of the most twisted group of producers out there today.

GEIN's sound can have a variety of "labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind 
when most come to describe the demented beats that are forged in the 
lab.

Coming off a scorching 2007, GEIN is set to take things ten steps 
further in 2008. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP), a 
few 12"'s released by the likes of Habit, Guerilla, Tech Itch, 
Penatration, Freak and quite a few more in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming 
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming 
projects include a brand new record label, a ton of solo projects, 
remixes, and collaborations with artists such as Current Value, Mayhem, 
Evol Intent, Counterstrike, Donny, Audio, The Sect and more that have 
been causing a ruckus around the world. Look out for the Gein - Clergy 
E.P.

forthcoming on Guerilla Records featuring Counterstrike, Donny, and 
Current Value!!

Watch out for GEIN in 2008 and beyond.

With support from the likes of heavyweights Tech Itch, Dieselboy, Evol 
Intent, Ewun, Breaker, SPL, Counterstrike, Limewax and more, these three 
will surely be a strong presence in drum n bass for a long time, and 
will be coming to kill dance floors and blow up speakers near you!!!!!!

Zardonic
Federico Agreda aka Zardonic is a controversial electronic -mainly drum 
& bass- music producer, born in October 22nd, 1985, and "one of the 
standards of Drum & Bass in Venezuela and one of the highest electronic 
talents in Barquisimeto city", according to the latin american webzine 
Flayers. By far, he is considered the most active and skilled drum & 
bass producer in the country.

In words of Lewis Davidson, owner of Technorganic Recordings, "This 
Venezuelan artist, fresh off the successful tune placement of .Moonlight 
Ceremony. as featured in AK1200's strongest DJ mix to date, is showing 
how his varied background, environmental location and unique production 
styles are quite possibly the secret recipe for DNB perfection". His 
sound is often defined by latin rhythms and sounds, industrial drumkits, 
rock / metal basslines, and high energy beats, embraced by an euphoric 
attitude during his live sets, that has allowed him to communicate such 
energy directly to the crowd, and driven to different forms of Darkstep, 
Mellow, Technoid or Experimental Drum & Bass.

With eight years of experience in producing and support from Dieselboy, 
John B, AK1200, Pendulum, The DJ Producer, Submerged, Mumblz, 
Counterstrike, Basic Operations, Identity, and many more artists, 
Zardonic has been able to get signed to several labels worldwide, such 
as Ohm Resistance, Technorganic, Mindsaw, Dark Asylum, Future Sickness, 
Foulplay, Suicide Dub, and so on.

Dan Curtin - Berlin/Cleveland - Mobilee,Metamorphic Recordings,Peacefrog 
Records, Tuning Spork Records and so on.......

Local Cleveland legend needs no introduction. Always a steller 
performance.

Dicogs bio
Dan Curtin began his music career in 1992. His fascination with music 
was sparked ten years earlier when he discovered the burgeoning hip-hop 
movement. Hip-hop, along with new wave, electro, and other sonic 
innovations of the Eighties began to loom largely in his life, and it 
was only a matter of time before Curtin began experimenting with music 
creation himself. When he finally heard the futuristic sounds of house 
and techno, everything changed. Drawing influence from stargazing 
evenings with a telescope and late night drives through nearby 
Cleveland, Ohio; music production became Curtin's primary focus. 
Cleveland, a city not known as a hub for house music creation, was 
initially isolating. However, Curtin was able to observe the more 
prominent scenes of other cities without becoming part of or being 
identified with any one of them. He began designing a new sound in 
techno and house music.

Curtin's first few records were released on Detroit's now defunct 33 RPM 
Records and Belgium's Buzz Records. Shortly thereafter, he started his 
own label, Metamorphic Recordings. Dancers and listeners alike began to 
take notice of his innovative sound signature, and before long Dan 
Curtin found himself being hailed as a key player in techno and house 
music. With his profile on the rise, he eventually caught the attention 
of Peacefrog in the mid .E0s. His releases under his own name and his 
Purveyors Of Fine Funk guises were welcomed with open arms by the worlds 
techno fraternity, many of which becoming key cuts in many a DJ's set 
for years following their release. Releasing three albums over a two 
year period 'Silicon Dawn, 'Web Of Life' and 'Art & Science', Dan Curtin 
has defined himself as one of the key players in the development of 
techno as we know it today


Rounding out the lineup

Morris Koad - Medium, Racecar - Louisville
DJ and promoter extraordinaire, Morris Koad is synonymous with techno in 
the city of Louisville, KY. He first began captivating audiences in 1995 
by playing electronica on college radio. Despite these humble 
beginnings, Morris Koad has reached an iconic status among his 
followers. Over the past 11 years he has commanded a total of over 14 
different residencies spread over Chicago, Louisville, St. Louis, and 
Nashville. He has pounded dance floors from Miami to San Francisco and 
played alongside such greats as Carl Cox, Josh Wink, and Felix the 
Housecat. In addition to his DJ endeavors, Morris founded his own label 
and DJ firm known as LHM, which is home to some of the Midwest.s finest 
talent. Today you will find Morris Koad hosting Medium, which is 
Louisville.s most popular and longest running techno and house monthly.

Bolus - Racecar, Tek-Know?
Bolus is a 10-year veteran DJ and maven of the dance music scene. Over 
the years he has been significantly involved within many facets of the 
industry in Europe and North America. Since 2000, Bolus has resided 
between London, England and America and has spent over 5 seasons 
networking, DJing, and promoting events in Ibiza, Spain. His endeavors 
are represented by Renaissance, Space, Pacha, and Eden among others. 
Bolus. sound is a truly eclectic composition of minimal house and 
techno... a flurry of percussive elements fused within a soundscape of 
bass lines and driving beats. It is described by many as an edgy, 
bass-heavy, and sometimes quirky blend of the underground. Today Bolus 
continues to DJ around the American Midwest and promotes his own night 
dubbed Rehab, which is dedicated to the minimalist approach to 
electronic dance music.

Sat Sep 20                 STEPPING INTO DARKNESS                Cincinnati

Royal Dubs Presents:
Stepping Into Darkness
September 20, 2008

Cyrus from Random Trio . Dubstep . London, UK - RTP, Tectonic
http://www.myspace.com/randomtrio, randomtrioproductions.com

One of the early pioneering DJ/producers of the sound we now call 
Dubstep, Cyrus from Random Trio 1st began his dj career back in 1998 as 
a ukg Dj. After just 3 months of mixing Cyrus was given his 1st chance 
to play for a local promotion in Croydon, shortly after he was offered a 
residency and never looked back. Various pirate radio shows followed 
along with more bookings for local clubs in & around London. The summer 
of 99 saw Cyrus take his dj'ing to the island of Corfu (Kavos). In this 
time Cyrus had met and became good friends with fellow Random Trio 
member Omni, and by 2000 were doing most of their dj sets together. They 
1st formed a little crew in 2001 consisting of themselves & 3 mc's and 
soon gained a good following. They built their 1st track by the end of 
the year and had heard interest from a major label. However before this 
took place they split going there own separate ways. Cyrus and Omni 
carried on dj'ing together and decided to carry on making beats for 
their radio shows. It was around this time they 1st heard Horsepower 
Productions and were taken aback by their unique style. They found the 
sound they were looking for. By 2003 Cyrus had made a batch of tunes and 
brought out his 1st release on their imprint RTP. This was the Lost City 
EP. January 2004 saw Cyrus with his own show on London's biggest pirate 
Rinse.fm.. One of the early nights was a night put on by DMZ called dub 
sessions held on a Sunday at black sheep bar in Croydon. With a newer 
member, Omen, Random trio have a number of successful releases and more 
recently Cyrus's From the Shadows LP. Random trio have played at clubs 
all over the world from Finland to California and look forward to the 
future.

weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

  Tonight Alaska Governor Sarah Palin will accept the Republican nomination for Vice President, a position that would put her second in line to be President of the United States. But before she accepts, I need your help to let America know where she stands on the brutal and needless aerial hunting of wolves and bears.
  Watch our new video on Palins awful record and share it with everyone you know who cares abut wildlife.
  
  Warning: This video is extremely disturbing. It contains graphic images of aerial hunting of wolves -- a brutal and needless practice that Governor Palin has fought hard to promote and expand.
  Despite strong scientific, ethical and public opposition to aerial hunting, Governor Palin has
    
   Proposed paying a $150 bounty for the left foreleg of each dead wolf.   
   Approved a $400,000 state-funded propaganda campaign to promote aerial hunting.   
   Introduced legislation to make it even easier to use aircraft to hunt wolves and bears.
  If you care about wildlife, please watch this video right now -- and then share it with every friend, neighbor, conservationist and wildlife lover you know.
  Tonight, all eyes will be on Governor Sarah Palin. Lets make sure the whole nation knows about her awful record on aerial hunting and protecting wildlife.
  Respectfully, 
              
Rodger Schlickeisen
President
Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund

  P.S. Please also share our video on blogs, social networks and elsewhere. Ive pasted the link to the video below to help you spread the word:

  Biden is a snake. The way he slid the RAVE act through was worse than the PATRIOT act. He snuck in a destruction of civil liberties on something meant to help abducted children.

Now you are mad at Palin for opposing the Bush Adminstration!!! Since we
don't live in Alaske we don't really kno what the situation is with polar
bears up there. Polar bears are one of few animals that will hunt a man dow=
n
to kill him. They aren't like in the Coke commercials. The Bush
adiministration made some weak attempt to act like they had some concern
about the global warming farce. She opposed them wanting to put polar bears
on the endagered species list. If polar bears and wolvesare endagering huma=
n
beings they should be shot as far as I'm concerned. You oppose killing them
because you only contact with them is seeing thme in cartoons. If they were
attacking children and pets in your town you would think different.

Not sure how legit this info is...someone sent this to me.



This is from a Bryn Mawr  college grad to her fellow alums
Dear classmates -

As an Alaskan, I am  writing to give all of you some information on 
Sarah Palin, Senator McCain's  choice for VP. As an Alaska voter, I know 
more than most of you about her  and, frankly, I am horrified that he 
picked her.
The most accurate  description of her is red neck. Her husband works in 
the oil fields of  Prudhoe Bay and races snow mobiles. She is a life 
time member of the NRA and  has worked tirelessly to allow 
indiscriminate hunting of wildlife in Alaska,  particularly wolves and 
bears. She has spent millions of Alaska state  dollars on aerial hunting 
of these predators from helicopters and airplanes,  dollars that should 
have been spent, for example, on Alaska's failing school  system.We have 
the lowest rate of high school graduation in the country.  
Not all of you may think aerial predator hunting is so bad, but how  
anyone (other than Alaska wolf-haters, of which there are many, most  
without teeth), could think this use of funds is appropriate is beyond  
me. If you want to know more about the aerialhunting travesty, let me  
know and I will send some links to informative web sites.
She has been a  strong supporter of increased use of fossil fuels, yet 
the McCain campaign  has the nerve to say she has "green" policies. The 
only thing green about  Sarah Palin is her lack of experience. She has 
consistently supported  drilling in ANWR, use of coal-burning power 
plants (as I write this, a new  coal plant is being built in her home 
town of Wasilla), strip mining, and  almost anything else that will 
unnecessarily exploit the diminishing  resources of Alaska and destroy 
its environment.
Prior to her one year as  governor of Alaska, she was mayor of Wasilla, 
a small red neck town outside  Anchorage.The average maximum education 
level of parents of junior high  school kids in Wasilla is 10th grade.

Unfortunately, I have to go to  Wasilla every week to get groceries and 
other supplies, so I have continual  contact with the people who put 
Palin in office in the first place. I know  what I'm talking about.

These people don't have a concept of the world  around them or of the 
serious issues facing the US. Furthermore, they don't  care. So long as 
they can go out and hunt their moose every fall, kill  wolves and bears 
and drive their snow mobiles and ATVs through every corner  of the 
wilderness, they're happy. I wish I were exaggerating.

Sarah  Palin is currently involved in a political corruption scandal. 
She fired an  individual in law enforcement here because she didn't like 
how he treated  one of her relatives during a divorce. The man's 
performance and ability  weren't considered; it was a totally personal 
firing and is currently under  investigation. While the issue 
isn't close to the scandal of Ted Steven's  corruption, it shows that 
Palin isn't "squeaky clean" and causes me to think  there may be more 
issues that could come to light. Clearly McCain doesn't  care.

When you line Palin up with Biden, the comparison would be  laughable if 
it weren't so serious. Sarah Palin knows nothing of economics  
(admittedly a weak area for McCain), or of international affairs, knows  
nothing of national government, Social Security, unemployment, health  
care systems - you name it. The idea of her meeting with heads of  
foreign governments around the world truly frightens me. 
In an  increasingly dangerous world, with the economy in shambles in the 
US, Sarah  Palin is uniquely UNqualified to be vice president. John 
McCain is not a  young man. Should something happen to him such that the 
vice president had  to step in, it would destroy our country and 
possibly the world to have  someone as inexperienced and inappropriate 
as Sarah Palin. 
The choice of  Palin is a cheap shot by McCain to try
to get Hillary supporters to vote for  him. When McCain introduced her 
today, Palin had the nerve to compare  herself with Hillary and 
Geraldine Ferraro. Sarah Palin, you are no Hillary  Clinton. 
To those of you who, like me, supported Hillary and were upset that  she 
did not get the nomination, please don't think that Sarah Palin is a  
worthy substitute. If you supported Hillary, regardless of what you  
think the media and the democratic party may have done to undermine her  
campaign, the person to support now is Obama, not Sarah Palin. 
To those  of you who are independent or undecided, don't let the choice 
of Palin sway  you in favor of McCain. Choosing her shows how 
unqualified McCain is to be  president. 
To those of you who are conservative, I guess you have no choice  for 
president. But please try to see how the poor choice of Palin tells us  
a great deal about McCain's judgment. While the political posturing  
inherent in the choice of Palin is obvious, the more serious issue is  
the fact that the VP is, literally, a heartbeat away from the  
presidency. Sarah Palin is totally and unequivocally unqualified to be  
vice president, let alone president.

I know this is a lengthy and  emotional email, but the stakes are high. 
I thought it might help for all of  you, regardless of political 
affiliation, to know something about Palin from  someone who has to live 
with her administration in Alaska on a daily  basis.

Here's some basic background from MoveOn.org: * She was elected  
Alaska's governor a little over a year and a half ago. Her previous  
office was mayor of Wasilla, a small town outside Anchorage.1 * Palin 
is  strongly anti-choice, opposing abortion even in the case of rape or 
incest.2  * She supported right-wing extremist Pat Buchanan for 
president in 2000. 3 *  Palin thinks creationism should be taught in 
public schools.4 * She's  doesn't think humans are the cause of climate 
change.5 * She's solidly in  line with John McCain's "Big Oil first" 
energy policy. She's pushed hard for  more oil drilling and says ren 
ewables won't be ready for years. She also  sued the Bush administration 
for listing polar bears as an endangered  speciesshe was worried it 
would interfere with more oil drilling in  Alaska.6
Here's a sample of Alaskan's responses: She is really just a mayor  from 
a small town outside Anchorage who has been a governor for only 1.5  
years, and has ZERO national and international experience. I shudder to  
think that she could be the person taking that 3AM call on the White  
House hotline, and the one who could potentially be charged with 
leading  the US in the volatile international scene that exists today. 
Rose M.,  Fairbanks, AK
She is VERY, VERY conservative, and far from perfect. She's a  hunter 
and fisherwoman, but votes against the environment again and again.  She 
ran on ethics reform, but is currently under investigation for several  
charges involving hiring and firing of state officials. She has NO  
experience beyond Alaska. Christine B., Denali Park, AK
As an Alaskan and  a feminist, I am beyond words at this announcement. 
Palin is not a feminist,  and she is not the ref ormer she claims to be. 
Karen L., Anchorage,  AK
Alaskans, collectively, are just as stunned as the rest of the nation.  
She is doing well running our State, but is totally inexperienced on 
the  national level, and very much unequipped=2 0to run the nation, if 
it came to  that. She is as far right as one can get, which has already 
been  communicated on the news. In our office of thirty employees (dems,  
republicans, and nonpartisans), not one person feels she is ready for  
the V.P. position.Sherry C., Anchorage, AK
She's vehemently anti-choice  and doesn't care about protecting our 
natural resources, even though she has  worked as a fisherman. McCain 
chose her to pick up the Hillary voters, but  Palin is no Hillary. 
Marina L., Juneau, AK
I think she's far too  inexperienced to be in this position. I'm all for 
a woman in the White  House, but not one who hasn't done anything to 
deserve it. There are far  many other women who have worked their way up 
and have much more experience  that would have been better choices. This 
is a patronizing decision on John  McCain's part- and insulting to 
females everywhere that he would assume  he'll get our vote by putting 
"A Woman" in that position.8 0Jennifer M.,  Anchorage, AK

Well, you shouldn't be voting for these Republicans.

Seriously.

Are you people mad?

I've heard a number of folks really, really hate on Obama/Biden, but =20
never for a swath of issues; always for one particular issue, or =20
another.

He's black comes to mind.  Biden and the RAVE act come to mind.  =20
Abortion, guns, and a slew of others.

But I never hear anyone argue either side for a group of issues.  It =20
seems like the most vocal folks on the internet are strong single-=20
issue folks.

Obama has a monstrous amount of his platform online, and if you'd like  
to know more on a particular issue, I can probably ask folks in the  
campaign and get back to you.

His plans on foreign policy, tax cuts, healthcare, education, and  
about two dozen other subjects are actually pretty well fleshed out,  
if you ignore CNN and Faux News.

Didn't call him my savior, by any means.  That said, if you read the  
speech that was part of, in context, it made a lot more sense.  I'm  
also willing to say I'm not a single issue voter; voting for Obama  
might burn me, but voting for McCain would be like cutting off both  
legs at the hip.

Subject: {pb-cle} koen park - everything in shadow [expcd006]

Now available from http://www.experimedia.net
Koen Park - Everything in Shadow [expcd006]
Everything in Shadow, is the new album (and second on Experimedia) by
Tokyo/London based Koen Park aka Ian Hawgood.Utilizing a wide array of
instruments, sound sources, and tools including vintage keyboards,
circuit bent synths, guitars, glockenspiels, samplers, drum machines,
live drums, field recordings, effects pedals, tape recorders, and
computers, Koen Park creates a hazy sun dried organic electronic
sound.Tape saturated modulating synths and subtle guitar washes.Cut-up
live drums and crackling micro-rhythms.Playful and calming melodic
structures interact with broken hip-hop like rhythms.Fractured field
recordings interwoven.Brief interludes of serene melodic drones.All of
these elements come together to create, Everything in Shadow, a
beautiful and nostalgic album, masterfully crafted with touches of
intentional imperfection that give the album a refreshing organic
feel. Your order of the limited edition packaged CD includes immediate
bonus downloads of the album in highest quality MP3 and/or lossless
FLAC formats so that you may begin to enjoy the album before your
package arrives.  And once again this release comes pacakged in
Experimedia's custom signature slim tall 3 panel eco-wallet package.

Samples can be heard, orders of the physical package (+bonus
downloads), and download only orders can be made at....
http://www.experimedia.net

Today also marks the release of Koen Park's free Pastoral Pioneer
album on the Acroplane net-label.

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Sep 13                      WRONG TURN 2             Yellow Springs, OH

NURAWTEK ENTERTAINMENT AND SLOPPY CINCY ARE AT IT AGAIN!!!!

at:

Feeding The Vibe:

CEREAL KILLAZ
The Cereal Killaz is Washington, DC area breakbeat/drum n bass act 
created in 2005, headed up by the mastermind producer, songwriter, & 
multi instrumentalist - [zarbizarre]. With elements of Nu Metal, Florida 
and UK Breaks, Drum n Bass, Industrial and Indie Rock, the sound can be 
described as hard hitting, with gut wrenching bass, heavy hitting drums, 
and nasty distorted synths and guitars that make you want to chew your 
face off.

The act has performed at events all over the US and Europe, with several 
heavy hitters in the electronic music scene, including: Deekline, 
Ctrl+Z, Aut0b0ts, Noisia, Baobinga, Mephisto Odyssey, Breakfastaz, 
Hyper, Dynamix II, Frankie Bones, Keoki, Dopamine, Krafty Kuts, Scott 
Henry, The Rogue Element, Annalyze, Reid Speed, Simply Jeff, Baby Anne 
and many more, and has been the only American act to perform at the 
Breakspoll International Breakbeat Awards, held at the superclub, 
Fabric, in London, UK (Feb 2007).

.... conceptually apart from the average nu skool ... innovative 
breakbeat .... - Mike Hogan, owner of Breakspoll - from review of the 
single, .Reality.
.Disturbing, in a good way.

. - Carl Loben, DJ MAG, May 2006


As a DJ act, Cereal Killaz / [zarbizarre] is one of the few breakbeat 
DJ's who practices harmonic mixing - the technique of mixing different 
keys artistically, instead of randomly, in order to create musical 
blends rather than bland or sour mixes.


GEIN
GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin pyscho Edward. 
Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant), Abel and Saint 
(founder of Habit Recordings). Formed in early 2004, the crew linked up 
when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel 
to create one of the most twisted group of producers out there today.

GEIN's sound can have a variety of "labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind 
when most come to describe the demented beats that are forged in the 
lab.

Coming off a scorching 2007, GEIN is set to take things ten steps 
further in 2008. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP), a 
few 12"'s released by the likes of Habit, Guerilla, Tech Itch, 
Penatration, Freak and quite a few more in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming 
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming 
projects include a brand new record label, a ton of solo projects, 
remixes, and collaborations with artists such as Current Value, Mayhem, 
Evol Intent, Counterstrike, Donny, Audio, The Sect and more that have 
been causing a ruckus around the world. Look out for the Gein - Clergy 
E.P.

forthcoming on Guerilla Records featuring Counterstrike, Donny, and 
Current Value!!

Watch out for GEIN in 2008 and beyond.

With support from the likes of heavyweights Tech Itch, Dieselboy, Evol 
Intent, Ewun, Breaker, SPL, Counterstrike, Limewax and more, these three 
will surely be a strong presence in drum n bass for a long time, and 
will be coming to kill dance floors and blow up speakers near you!!!!!!

Zardonic
Federico Agreda aka Zardonic is a controversial electronic -mainly drum 
& bass- music producer, born in October 22nd, 1985, and "one of the 
standards of Drum & Bass in Venezuela and one of the highest electronic 
talents in Barquisimeto city", according to the latin american webzine 
Flayers. By far, he is considered the most active and skilled drum & 
bass producer in the country.

In words of Lewis Davidson, owner of Technorganic Recordings, "This 
Venezuelan artist, fresh off the successful tune placement of .Moonlight 
Ceremony. as featured in AK1200's strongest DJ mix to date, is showing 
how his varied background, environmental location and unique production 
styles are quite possibly the secret recipe for DNB perfection". His 
sound is often defined by latin rhythms and sounds, industrial drumkits, 
rock / metal basslines, and high energy beats, embraced by an euphoric 
attitude during his live sets, that has allowed him to communicate such 
energy directly to the crowd, and driven to different forms of Darkstep, 
Mellow, Technoid or Experimental Drum & Bass.

With eight years of experience in producing and support from Dieselboy, 
John B, AK1200, Pendulum, The DJ Producer, Submerged, Mumblz, 
Counterstrike, Basic Operations, Identity, and many more artists, 
Zardonic has been able to get signed to several labels worldwide, such 
as Ohm Resistance, Technorganic, Mindsaw, Dark Asylum, Future Sickness, 
Foulplay, Suicide Dub, and so on.

Local Cleveland legend needs no introduction. Always a steller 
performance.

Dicogs bio
Dan Curtin began his music career in 1992. His fascination with music 
was sparked ten years earlier when he discovered the burgeoning hip-hop 
movement. Hip-hop, along with new wave, electro, and other sonic 
innovations of the Eighties began to loom largely in his life, and it 
was only a matter of time before Curtin began experimenting with music 
creation himself. When he finally heard the futuristic sounds of house 
and techno, everything changed. Drawing influence from stargazing 
evenings with a telescope and late night drives through nearby 
Cleveland, Ohio; music production became Curtin's primary focus. 
Cleveland, a city not known as a hub for house music creation, was 
initially isolating. However, Curtin was able to observe the more 
prominent scenes of other cities without becoming part of or being 
identified with any one of them. He began designing a new sound in 
techno and house music.

Curtin's first few records were released on Detroit's now defunct 33 RPM 
Records and Belgium's Buzz Records. Shortly thereafter, he started his 
own label, Metamorphic Recordings. Dancers and listeners alike began to 
take notice of his innovative sound signature, and before long Dan 
Curtin found himself being hailed as a key player in techno and house 
music. With his profile on the rise, he eventually caught the attention 
of Peacefrog in the mid .E0s. His releases under his own name and his 
Purveyors Of Fine Funk guises were welcomed with open arms by the worlds

Sat Sep 20                 STEPPING INTO DARKNESS                Cincinnati

Royal Dubs Presents:
Stepping Into Darkness
September 20, 2008

Cyrus from Random Trio . Dubstep . London, UK - RTP, Tectonic
http://www.myspace.com/randomtrio, randomtrioproductions.com

One of the early pioneering DJ/producers of the sound we now call 
Dubstep, Cyrus from Random Trio 1st began his dj career back in 1998 as 
a ukg Dj. After just 3 months of mixing Cyrus was given his 1st chance 
to play for a local promotion in Croydon, shortly after he was offered a 
residency and never looked back. Various pirate radio shows followed 
along with more bookings for local clubs in & around London. The summer 
of 99 saw Cyrus take his dj'ing to the island of Corfu (Kavos). In this 
time Cyrus had met and became good friends with fellow Random Trio 
member Omni, and by 2000 were doing most of their dj sets together. They 
1st formed a little crew in 2001 consisting of themselves & 3 mc's and 
soon gained a good following. They built their 1st track by the end of 
the year and had heard interest from a major label. However before this 
took place they split going there own separate ways. Cyrus and Omni 
carried on dj'ing together and decided to carry on making beats for 
their radio shows. It was around this time they 1st heard Horsepower 
Productions and were taken aback by their unique style. They found the 
sound they were looking for. By 2003 Cyrus had made a batch of tunes and 
brought out his 1st release on their imprint RTP. This was the Lost City 
EP. January 2004 saw Cyrus with his own show on London's biggest pirate 
Rinse.fm.. One of the early nights was a night put on by DMZ called dub 
sessions held on a Sunday at black sheep bar in Croydon. With a newer 
member, Omen, Random trio have a number of successful releases and more 
recently Cyrus's From the Shadows LP. Random trio have played at clubs 
all over the world from Finland to California and look forward to the 
future.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

**A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

Subject: {pb-cle} Jeremy Bible & Jason Henry - Marker [out now on Gruenrekorder]

Marker, the new album by Jeremy Bible & Jason Henry is now available
from the Frankfurt, Germany based label Gruenrekorder.
http://gruenrekorder.de/?page_id=305

SYNOPSIS: Marker is the first in a two part album concept for the
Gruenrekorder label by Canton, Ohio, US based sound artists Jeremy
Bible & Jason Henry. Marker combines multiple elements in order to
create constructed fictional environments, realities, locations, and
atmospheres. Field recordings captured from the northeast Ohio region
and often times in and around the individual artist's homes, processed
and clean, play a large part, alongside treated and processed acoustic
instruments and subtle touches of electronic sound design.

CONCEPT: The two albums, Marker and Magnet, were created with the
intention of being experienced both individually and consecutively
allowing for up to four unique listening contexts.  It is also
recommended that the pieces which the two albums are comprised of are
combined and experienced in a random manner creating infinite
listening experiences.

PROCESS: The sound elements presented on both Marker & Magnet were
recorded, composed, performed, collected, and organized by the artists
individually over a period of time for the intention of single
impromptu & improvised collaborative recording session.  Following
this 'content collection' period the artists met for a lengthy
recording session at Jeremy Bible's Experimedia Studio1 where these
individual sound elements were arranged, processed, and mixed by the
two artists in an improvisational manner under conditions of half
sleep like states of subconscious focus.  The elements of surprise
introduced in a collaborative improvisational recording scenario play
a large role in the duo's process and resulting sound works.

So this is two separate albums, one called "Marker" and one called
"Magnet?" Or just one new album called "Marker" (as indicated in the
subject line of this email)?

And you suggest we can either listen to each album by itself, or one right
after the other? So I could choose to listen to any combination of the
following:

Marker by itsef
Magnet by itself
Marker followed by Magent
Magent followed by Marker
various tracks off either album, randomized by your CD player

And this is supposed to provide me "up to four unique listening contexts"
(actually, with my CD player on 'random' that would be 5 listening
experiences, right?)

I'm just trying to get this straight!

(I'm also extrememly bored at work today ... where I write
training/procedural manuals all day long ... and I'm extrememly tired too
... grrrrr)

Marker was released today.  Magnet will be released Q1 2009.
And yes the 2 cds are meant to interact in the ways you described.
My personal favorite is....
Marker followed by Magnet

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Dan Curtin - Berlin/Cleveland - Mobilee,Metamorphic Recordings,Peacefrog 
Records, Tuning Spork Records and so on.......

Local Cleveland legend needs no introduction. Always a steller 
performance.

Dicogs bio
Dan Curtin began his music career in 1992. His fascination with music 
was sparked ten years earlier when he discovered the burgeoning hip-hop 
movement. Hip-hop, along with new wave, electro, and other sonic 
innovations of the Eighties began to loom largely in his life, and it 
was only a matter of time before Curtin began experimenting with music 
creation himself. When he finally heard the futuristic sounds of house 
and techno, everything changed. Drawing influence from stargazing 
evenings with a telescope and late night drives through nearby 
Cleveland, Ohio; music production became Curtin's primary focus. 
Cleveland, a city not known as a hub for house music creation, was 
initially isolating. However, Curtin was able to observe the more 
prominent scenes of other cities without becoming part of or being 
identified with any one of them. He began designing a new sound in 
techno and house music.

Curtin's first few records were released on Detroit's now defunct 33 RPM 
Records and Belgium's Buzz Records. Shortly thereafter, he started his 
own label, Metamorphic Recordings. Dancers and listeners alike began to 
take notice of his innovative sound signature, and before long Dan 
Curtin found himself being hailed as a key player in techno and house 
music. With his profile on the rise, he eventually caught the attention 
of Peacefrog in the mid .E0s. His releases under his own name and his 
Purveyors Of Fine Funk guises were welcomed with open arms by the worlds 
techno fraternity, many of which becoming key cuts in many a DJ's set 
for years following their release. Releasing three albums over a two 
year period 'Silicon Dawn, 'Web Of Life' and 'Art & Science', Dan Curtin 
has defined himself as one of the key players in the development of 
techno as we know it today


Rounding out the lineup

Morris Koad - Medium, Racecar - Louisville
DJ and promoter extraordinaire, Morris Koad is synonymous with techno in 
the city of Louisville, KY. He first began captivating audiences in 1995 
by playing electronica on college radio. Despite these humble 
beginnings, Morris Koad has reached an iconic status among his 
followers. Over the past 11 years he has commanded a total of over 14 
different residencies spread over Chicago, Louisville, St. Louis, and 
Nashville. He has pounded dance floors from Miami to San Francisco and 
played alongside such greats as Carl Cox, Josh Wink, and Felix the 
Housecat. In addition to his DJ endeavors, Morris founded his own label 
and DJ firm known as LHM, which is home to some of the Midwest.s finest 
talent. Today you will find Morris Koad hosting Medium, which is 
Louisville.s most popular and longest running techno and house monthly.

Bolus - Racecar, Tek-Know?
Bolus is a 10-year veteran DJ and maven of the dance music scene. Over 
the years he has been significantly involved within many facets of the 
industry in Europe and North America. Since 2000, Bolus has resided 
between London, England and America and has spent over 5 seasons 
networking, DJing, and promoting events in Ibiza, Spain. His endeavors 
are represented by Renaissance, Space, Pacha, and Eden among others. 
Bolus. sound is a truly eclectic composition of minimal house and 
techno... a flurry of percussive elements fused within a soundscape of 
bass lines and driving beats. It is described by many as an edgy, 
bass-heavy, and sometimes quirky blend of the underground. Today Bolus 
continues to DJ around the American Midwest and promotes his own night 
dubbed Rehab, which is dedicated to the minimalist approach to 
electronic dance music.

Sat Sep 20                    INTO THE DARKNESS                  Cincinnati

Royal Dubs Presents:
Stepping Into Darkness
September 20, 2008

Cyrus from Random Trio . Dubstep . London, UK - RTP, Tectonic
http://www.myspace.com/randomtrio, randomtrioproductions.com

One of the early pioneering DJ/producers of the sound we now call 
Dubstep, Cyrus from Random Trio 1st began his dj career back in 1998 as 
a ukg Dj. After just 3 months of mixing Cyrus was given his 1st chance 
to play for a local promotion in Croydon, shortly after he was offered a 
residency and never looked back. Various pirate radio shows followed 
along with more bookings for local clubs in & around London. The summer 
of 99 saw Cyrus take his dj'ing to the island of Corfu (Kavos). In this 
time Cyrus had met and became good friends with fellow Random Trio 
member Omni, and by 2000 were doing most of their dj sets together. They 
1st formed a little crew in 2001 consisting of themselves & 3 mc's and 
soon gained a good following. They built their 1st track by the end of 
the year and had heard interest from a major label. However before this 
took place they split going there own separate ways. Cyrus and Omni 
carried on dj'ing together and decided to carry on making beats for 
their radio shows. It was around this time they 1st heard Horsepower 
Productions and were taken aback by their unique style. They found the 
sound they were looking for. By 2003 Cyrus had made a batch of tunes and 
brought out his 1st release on their imprint RTP. This was the Lost City 
EP. January 2004 saw Cyrus with his own show on London's biggest pirate 
Rinse.fm.. One of the early nights was a night put on by DMZ called dub 
sessions held on a Sunday at black sheep bar in Croydon. With a newer 
member, Omen, Random trio have a number of successful releases and more 
recently Cyrus's From the Shadows LP. Random trio have played at clubs 
all over the world from Finland to California and look forward to the 
future.

Fri Sep 26                   MASSIVE DESTRUCTION                    Detroit

DJ SEOUL (Bangtech 12/DetroitTechnoMilita/Detroit) Techno

Raised on the East side of Detroit, Seoul had an early start in music. 
At a young age, various forms of counterculture sounds and movements 
heavily influenced him. His formal training began in 1985 with the 
drums, and continues today with both traditional, and electronic 
instruments.

On October 13th, 1995 it was at the Metroplex Records tenth year 
anniversary party that DJ Seoul was born. It was at this time that Bill 
figured out the difference between good music, bad music and Detroit 
music. Seoul remembers listening to The Wizard's mix shows on WJLB and 
the Electrifying Mojo on WGPR, and credits those as early influences on 
his style. He also credits Detroit House legends, Terrence Parker, Kenny 
Dixon Jr., Mike Clark and Theo Parrish as influencing his early career 
as a House DJ. Later he developed his expertise as an Electro/Techno 
Bass DJ. He cites influences: Aux 88, Drexciya, Model 500, Ectomorph and 
Dopplereffekt, and electronic pioneers Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic 
Orchestra, The Egyptian Lover, Afrika Bambaataa and Man Parrish.

It was a natural fit for him to play the music that he loved, 
representing his home town properly by playing Detroit Music. Playing 
wide assortments of music, from Electro, Hip-Hop and Rare Groove, to 
House, and Detroit Techno, DJ Seoul has become known for his style of 
bringing a Hip-Hop Turntablist style of mixing and scratching to his set 
regardless of genre

Mike "Shifty" Amerine (IMW/Sonicsynergy/PSP/Kalamazoo)

Michael Amerine, who also appears under the moniker Shifty, is the 
founder of Lower Frequency Production Group and a resident DJ for 
Profound Sound Productions as well as Sonic Synergy Productions. In 
addition to playing events on both the east and west coasts of Michigan, 
he has been running a weekly night show, Lower Frequency Thursdays, at 
Boomerangs in Kalamazoo, Michigan since August of 2005. There, he books 
a successful mix of DJs featuring various genres of electronic music 
that move the dance floor. With seven years of DJ experience under his 
belt, Mike has dabbled in a multitude of genres including D&B, 
Progressive, and House that eventually shaped his style into a cerebral, 
elevating, and energetic variety of techno that runs the gambit from 
minimal and deep tech-house to heavy peak hour and progressive techno. 
The funky, rolling bass, heady synthesized patterns and bouncing 
percussion will take listeners on an aural journey that will not be 
forgotten. Michael has hit the ground running, and now that he is 
delving into the world of production and live pa, you can expect many 
more good things to come.

Vinny Bricks (GSP ENT/Cincinatti) Hard Techno

Born in Flint, Michigan, Vincent Brick aka Vinny Bricks grew up the son 
of a performing Blues/Rock guitarist, and was heavily influenced by 
early exposure to a diverse mix of rock, blues and soul. At age nine he 
began learning to play guitar, and in the following years spread out to 
bass guitar, percussion and keyboards, jamming with friends at every 
opportunity. By the age of 15 Vinny was playing his first paying gigs 
with local rock bands in the Youngstown. Vinny discovered the rave scene 
in 1994, and was immediately mesmerized and intrigued by the art of 
turntablism and live dance music. Moving to Phoenix, Arizona in 1996 to 
go to school for Audio Engineering, Vinny began working with old friend 
and former bandmate Ken Petrosky (aka DJ Cluster Poindexter) and his 
company, Kids Under The Carpet booking and promoting parties inside the 
Arizona dance music scene. Inspiration struck with the thrift store find 
of a twenty-year-old Moog synthesizer, in a few short months Vincent 
acquired enough equipment to start laying down original techno, and in 
the summer of 1998 he played his first live p.a. alongside a cast of 
well-known national acts at a sizable rave in Phoenix. Around this time, 
he also completed the Master Recording Program at the Conservatory of 
Recording Arts and Sciences in Tempe, AZ. Vinny then returned to Ohio 
where he obtained an internship at a large commercial recording facility 
in downtown Cincinnati, and eventually went on to a day job at a 
Cincinnati audio/video production and duplication firm. In the preceding 
months Vinny had acquired a very deep appreciation for house music which 
was highly influential in his own productions, and a pair of Technics 
turntables was purchased as he took a more serious interest in DJing. 
Upon Petrosky's relocation to Cincy, the duo formed For Those Who Know 
as a vehicle to promote their music; together the two began cutting dub 
plates, and they launched a website that exposed their music to people 
around the world.Today Vinny lives in the Cincinnati, DJing house and 
techno numerous times a month at clubs and parties throughout the 
Midwest. A number of his DJ sets are available for download at 
www.vinnybricks.com, and he is currently available for worldwide 
bookings.

Southside (Bangtech 12/Detroit)

Dj Southside was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. Growing up on a 
steady diet of hip hop and dance music has led him to rock out parties 
all across the U.S. Whether he is playing House, Hip Hop, or in a Dj 
battle you know he is going to bring it every time he steps behind the 
decks!!

It all started in 1994 when a friend asked him to a party. Little did he 
know he was about to find his life calling. .My friend took me to the 
now infamous Packard Plant to Ritchie Hawtin.s Spastik party. It was the 
craziest shit I.ve ever seen!! I remember seeing these guys play records 
and was amazed at how they totally controlled the vibe of the party. 
After watching Ritchie Hawtin play Spastik LIVE I was hooked. Recalls Dj 
Southside.

Shortly after that party a co-worker by the name of Dj Space Ace agreed 
to show him how to DJ. Showing him the fundamentals, Dj Southside took 
in all he was taught and ran with it.

Fri Oct 10                    STANTON WARRIORS                   Pittsburgh

Kicking off their North American Tour here in Pittsburgh at Altar bar.

Here is their bio if you would like to learn more about them...

True pioneers of a sound that broke all the rules back in 1998, Stanton 
Warriors took garage and twisted it beyond all recognition, dropping 
speaker shattering bass lines and massive beats.all to devastating 
effect. Stanton Warriors had arrived.

In 2001, Stanton Warriors laid down a fresh new sound with the seminal 
.Stanton Sessions. that was instantly signed to XL Recordings. The mix 
saw off competition from Fat Boy Slim and Deep Dish to win Best Album at 
the Dance Star Awards, and again at the Muzik Mag Awards where they beat 
Dave Clarke and Danny Tenaglia, whilst the mix recently featured in 
Mixmags top 50 best compilations ever industry poll. 'Stanton Sessions' 
went on to become the biggest selling breaks album of all time - a feat 
as yet unsurpassed.

weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

ok this is too funny.. who wants to here the one about how i used to tell her an this other whore heather that whoever made more money that night at the club (plus trickin' in the club) could sleep in the bed with me... the other one had to hit the couch... this was of course long after i had did them both.. but Mandie got jealous... for someone who claims I have a small member she sure kept calling me for years after the four I threw away even knowing her... she loves fucking her mans friends.. but god forbid he stray.. it breaks her heart ... awwww.. sniffle sniffle... that is if she had one... but that makes two things she will never be able to have.. no three... one. the ability to be honest.. shes just pathological as hell with it.. two. any ability to care about anyone but Mandie.. gotta have a heart for that.. and finally three. any children of her own... if DJ Jayne and Canton in general knew what was good for them they would get the hell away
 from that dried up saggy tittied washed up wish she were a pornstar instead of a whore cunt lier as soon as possible.. she is worthless.. and I am a humanitarian.. she is NOT human.. shes the devil bobby buchay the devil.... LOL

Ok kids... You want to make this really fun?

I live in Chicago as some of you know.
Andy the Pooh came to visit once and we were audience members at the Jerry
Springer show.
It reminds me of this conversation on the list.

So.... since I know some producers there, I am curious to know if you guys
would want to come to Chicago at their expense and go on the show and tell
the story.

Why now? You already aired it out on this list... which is public.

What do you say?

If you are down... I will set it up.

Dave

Eyebrows raised over city school policy that sets 50% as minimum score
1+1=3? In city schools, it's half right

Monday, September 22, 2008
By Joe Smydo, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

Pittsburgh Public Schools officials say they want to give struggling 
children a chance, but the district is raising eyebrows with a policy 
that sets 50 percent as the minimum score a student can receive for 
assignments, tests and other work.

The district and teachers union last week issued a joint memo to ensure 
staff members' compliance with the policy, which was already on the 
books but enforced only at some schools. Pittsburgh Federation of 
Teachers President John Tarka said the policy is several years old.

While some districts use "F" as a failing grade, the city uses an "E."

"The 'E' is to be recorded no lower than a 50 percent, regardless of the 
actual percent earned. For example, if the student earns a 20 percent on 
a class assignment, the grade is recorded as a 50 percent," said the 
memo from Jerri Lippert, the district's executive director of 
curriculum, instruction and professional development, and Mary VanHorn, 
a PFT vice president.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Sep 26                   MASSIVE DESTRUCTION                    Detroit

DJ SEOUL (Bangtech 12/DetroitTechnoMilita/Detroit) Techno

Raised on the East side of Detroit, Seoul had an early start in music. 
At a young age, various forms of counterculture sounds and movements 
heavily influenced him. His formal training began in 1985 with the 
drums, and continues today with both traditional, and electronic 
instruments.

On October 13th, 1995 it was at the Metroplex Records tenth year 
anniversary party that DJ Seoul was born. It was at this time that Bill 
figured out the difference between good music, bad music and Detroit 
music. Seoul remembers listening to The Wizard's mix shows on WJLB and 
the Electrifying Mojo on WGPR, and credits those as early influences on 
his style. He also credits Detroit House legends, Terrence Parker, Kenny 
Dixon Jr., Mike Clark and Theo Parrish as influencing his early career 
as a House DJ. Later he developed his expertise as an Electro/Techno 
Bass DJ. He cites influences: Aux 88, Drexciya, Model 500, Ectomorph and 
Dopplereffekt, and electronic pioneers Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic 
Orchestra, The Egyptian Lover, Afrika Bambaataa and Man Parrish.

It was a natural fit for him to play the music that he loved, 
representing his home town properly by playing Detroit Music. Playing 
wide assortments of music, from Electro, Hip-Hop and Rare Groove, to 
House, and Detroit Techno, DJ Seoul has become known for his style of 
bringing a Hip-Hop Turntablist style of mixing and scratching to his set 
regardless of genre

Mike "Shifty" Amerine (IMW/Sonicsynergy/PSP/Kalamazoo)

Michael Amerine, who also appears under the moniker Shifty, is the 
founder of Lower Frequency Production Group and a resident DJ for 
Profound Sound Productions as well as Sonic Synergy Productions. In 
addition to playing events on both the east and west coasts of Michigan, 
he has been running a weekly night show, Lower Frequency Thursdays, at 
Boomerangs in Kalamazoo, Michigan since August of 2005. There, he books 
a successful mix of DJs featuring various genres of electronic music 
that move the dance floor. With seven years of DJ experience under his 
belt, Mike has dabbled in a multitude of genres including D&B, 
Progressive, and House that eventually shaped his style into a cerebral, 
elevating, and energetic variety of techno that runs the gambit from 
minimal and deep tech-house to heavy peak hour and progressive techno. 
The funky, rolling bass, heady synthesized patterns and bouncing 
percussion will take listeners on an aural journey that will not be 
forgotten. Michael has hit the ground running, and now that he is 
delving into the world of production and live pa, you can expect many 
more good things to come.

Vinny Bricks (GSP ENT/Cincinatti) Hard Techno

Born in Flint, Michigan, Vincent Brick aka Vinny Bricks grew up the son 
of a performing Blues/Rock guitarist, and was heavily influenced by 
early exposure to a diverse mix of rock, blues and soul. At age nine he 
began learning to play guitar, and in the following years spread out to 
bass guitar, percussion and keyboards, jamming with friends at every 
opportunity. By the age of 15 Vinny was playing his first paying gigs 
with local rock bands in the Youngstown. Vinny discovered the rave scene 
in 1994, and was immediately mesmerized and intrigued by the art of 
turntablism and live dance music. Moving to Phoenix, Arizona in 1996 to 
go to school for Audio Engineering, Vinny began working with old friend 
and former bandmate Ken Petrosky (aka DJ Cluster Poindexter) and his 
company, Kids Under The Carpet booking and promoting parties inside the 
Arizona dance music scene. Inspiration struck with the thrift store find 
of a twenty-year-old Moog synthesizer, in a few short months Vincent 
acquired enough equipment to start laying down original techno, and in 
the summer of 1998 he played his first live p.a. alongside a cast of 
well-known national acts at a sizable rave in Phoenix. Around this time, 
he also completed the Master Recording Program at the Conservatory of 
Recording Arts and Sciences in Tempe, AZ. Vinny then returned to Ohio 
where he obtained an internship at a large commercial recording facility 
in downtown Cincinnati, and eventually went on to a day job at a 
Cincinnati audio/video production and duplication firm. In the preceding 
months Vinny had acquired a very deep appreciation for house music which 
was highly influential in his own productions, and a pair of Technics 
turntables was purchased as he took a more serious interest in DJing. 
Upon Petrosky's relocation to Cincy, the duo formed For Those Who Know 
as a vehicle to promote their music; together the two began cutting dub 
plates, and they launched a website that exposed their music to people 
around the world.Today Vinny lives in the Cincinnati, DJing house and 
techno numerous times a month at clubs and parties throughout the 
Midwest. A number of his DJ sets are available for download at 
www.vinnybricks.com, and he is currently available for worldwide 
bookings.

Southside (Bangtech 12/Detroit)

Dj Southside was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. Growing up on a 
steady diet of hip hop and dance music has led him to rock out parties 
all across the U.S. Whether he is playing House, Hip Hop, or in a Dj 
battle you know he is going to bring it every time he steps behind the 
decks!!

It all started in 1994 when a friend asked him to a party. Little did he 
know he was about to find his life calling. .My friend took me to the 
now infamous Packard Plant to Ritchie Hawtin.s Spastik party. It was the 
craziest shit I.ve ever seen!! I remember seeing these guys play records 
and was amazed at how they totally controlled the vibe of the party. 
After watching Ritchie Hawtin play Spastik LIVE I was hooked. Recalls Dj 
Southside.

Shortly after that party a co-worker by the name of Dj Space Ace agreed 
to show him how to DJ. Showing him the fundamentals, Dj Southside took 
in all he was taught and ran with it.

Fri Oct 10                    STANTON WARRIORS                   Pittsburgh

Kicking off their North American Tour here in Pittsburgh at Altar bar.

Here is their bio if you would like to learn more about them...

True pioneers of a sound that broke all the rules back in 1998, Stanton 
Warriors took garage and twisted it beyond all recognition, dropping 
speaker shattering bass lines and massive beats.all to devastating 
effect. Stanton Warriors had arrived.

In 2001, Stanton Warriors laid down a fresh new sound with the seminal 
.Stanton Sessions. that was instantly signed to XL Recordings. The mix 
saw off competition from Fat Boy Slim and Deep Dish to win Best Album at 
the Dance Star Awards, and again at the Muzik Mag Awards where they beat 
Dave Clarke and Danny Tenaglia, whilst the mix recently featured in 
Mixmags top 50 best compilations ever industry poll. 'Stanton Sessions' 
went on to become the biggest selling breaks album of all time - a feat 
as yet unsurpassed.

Fri Nov 07                     SPIRIT CATCHER                     Cleveland

**A Very Special "System Party" with-

Spirit Catcher (Belgium) 2020Vision, Moodmusic,Silver Network, 
Freerange...

History has spawned hundreds of genius double acts where two minds and 
talents collide to form something innovative and artistically 
challenging. Unfortunately, Spirit Catcher are just a pair of european 
weirdos. As we all know, exciting and romantic collisions happen in, 
say, Hollywood or London. Not in Belgium. I mean, does Belgium have 
C.H.I.P.s? Or Hart to Hart? It doesnt. It has bugger all. No heroes, no 
drama, no action. Chocolates.beer.and Spirit Catcher. Now listen - Jean 
Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they 
have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His 
father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high 
quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due 
to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that 
Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father 
could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated 
psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and 
over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could 
set him free from this cycle. Thomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary 
Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette 
of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up 
its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange 
levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the 
music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when 
he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the 
modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room 
suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told 
him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would 
be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away 
in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the 
explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that 
hospital room. The two were fated to meet. Jean was walking to the shops 
to get some fresh air and a bite to eat, when he was gripped into zombie 
mode again, and dragged by unseen forces back towards the studio. Tom 
was returning from taking his beloved Juno106 into a shop to be 
repaired, when a tall figure loomed towards him, muttering 2dB down at 
90 Hertz.make some room for bottom end.separate the kick.16khz 
shinestudio..studio.. Tom stared for a while at this possessed man. 
Freak!, he thought, until he stopped - and realised that he himself was 
a goddamn freak too. Hmmm? And anyway - this talk of studios.who 
knows.they would be sure to have modulation wheels.The Formula! The 
Formula!! Toms eyes flashed white and black, black and white. They were 
seized together in a gnashing frenzy, bound by their pasts into a crazed 
march back towards the lure of the studio. And so Spirit Catcher was 
born.

That is just a little too far, people have been banned in the past for
way less... as much as this drama is interesting to read I think it's
clear there's some very sad and deeply personal issues between these
two that should not be aired in public... unless of course it's on
Jerry Springer.

thee
&gt;&gt; worst person in history.. I may even call for a vote to be taken up so
we
&gt;&gt; can get her kicked off the planet.. it would be the most humane thing
to do
&gt;&gt; considering she is not only a disturbance in the force but also an
&gt;&gt; environmental hazard with whatever that toxic ooze is that drips from
her
&gt;&gt; pussy... going on that show may very well save our planet from
inevidable
&gt;&gt; destructive whorishness that is bound to have devistating effects on
us and
&gt;&gt; our children for generations.. all in favor of voting this worthless
whore
&gt;&gt; off the plant say "EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"

&gt;&gt;&gt; I live in Chicago as some of you know.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Andy the Pooh came to visit once and we were audience members at
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jerry Springer show.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It reminds me of this conversation on the list.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; So.... since I know some producers there, I am curious to know if
you
&gt;&gt;&gt; guys would want to come to Chicago at their expense and go on the
show and
&gt;&gt;&gt; tell the story.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why now? You already aired it out on this list... which is public.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you say?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are down... I will set it up.

Ok kids... You want to make this really fun?

I live in Chicago as some of you know.
Andy the Pooh came to visit once and we were audience members at the Jerry =
Springer show.
It reminds me of this conversation on the list.

So.... since I know some producers there, I am curious to know if you guys =
would want to come to Chicago at their expense and go on the show and tell =
the story.

Why now? You already aired it out on this list... which is public.

What do you say?

If you are down... I will set it up.

That is just a little too far, people have been banned in the past for
way less... as much as this drama is interesting to read I think it's
clear there's some very sad and deeply personal issues between these
two that should not be aired in public... unless of course it's on
Jerry Springer.

thank you voice of reason...
seriously...
*sigh*
why would even be a part of pb-cle if you hate it?
and what the hell could the police do for me posting things here..
"leave me alone"... bitch I didn't e-mail you.. I posted on a list
a list you don't even care about...
get a brain Mandie..
thats how this whole thing started to begin with..
a bad joke about Jem the musician..
turned into a bad joke about your brainless ass..
then a simply funny rant by me about your pathological lying...
then you of course went off and over dramatized the whole sitchy..
how retarded...
all you did was prove every word I said with your dumb posts and outlandish=
 claims..
the jokes dead.. this thread is no longer funny just dumb...

thank you voice of reason...
seriously...
*sigh*
why would even be a part of pb-cle if you hate it?
and what the hell could the police do for me posting things here..
"leave me alone"... bitch I didn't e-mail you.. I posted on a list
a list you don't even care about...
get a brain Mandie..
thats how this whole thing started to begin with..
a bad joke about Jem the musician..
turned into a bad joke about your brainless ass..
then a simply funny rant by me about your pathological lying...
then you of course went off and over dramatized the whole sitchy..
how retarded...
all you did was prove every word I said with your dumb posts and outlandish=
 claims..
the jokes dead.. this thread is no longer funny just dumb...

&gt; here here... I agree these "two" people are
&gt; definately messed as all get out.. that is if you are
&gt; referring to Mandie and her alternate personality
&gt; "Gem".. but seriously I didn't think she would
&gt; even be subscribed still or I would have never mentioned her
&gt; simply because I know the drama that surrounds the bitch..
&gt; thus why we aren't together.. but I agree that this is
&gt; offtopic and innappropriate for this list... I apologize if
&gt; this post is&nbsp;"bothering" anyone.. I refuse to
&gt; respond to anything else unless&nbsp;something is directed at me
&gt; personally.. otherwise I really could care less... the only
&gt; true solution is to kick her off pb-cle.. before me she
&gt; never had been to a rave or listened to any sort of
&gt; electronic music.. and she obviously has the opinion that
&gt; pb-cle is outdated and retarded so why allow her to be
&gt; here.. that having been said.. well... what else is there to
&gt; say.. 
&gt; another great quote "here's to you, here's to
&gt; pb-cle, shall we ever disagree... kick that&nbsp;stinky whore
&gt; off here&nbsp; duhhhhhhh" -- ME?

&gt; That is just a little too far, people have been banned in
&gt; the past for
&gt; way less... as much as this drama is interesting to read I
&gt; think it's
&gt; clear there's some very sad and deeply personal issues
&gt; between these
&gt; two that should not be aired in public... unless of course
&gt; it's on
&gt; Jerry Springer.

Since this is quite the nonsense list this week, here some BSP but at =
least it is MUSIC orientated!=20

For those of you who have interest or like to buy local, and yes there =
are those who do, Grand Poo-bas brings new vinyl 12" into Northeast Ohio =
every week. The list below is just some of the new and restocked items =
that are in stock now.=20

We can't order everything we would like to stock, so we concentrate on =
labels and artists we know that are good sellers, however, we do provide =
to you the same order lists that our suppliers send to us! These have =
new releases from many different countries, and include sound samples. =
We send these lists on FRIDAY NIGHT and you need to get your order back =
to us by noon on Sunday then you can pick up your requests or we can =
mail them out on Thursday. http://www.poo-bas.com/pre-order/index.htm =
has all this lists from this year and you can get them directly in your =
inbox by subscribing at http://www.poo-bas.com

We don't stock a lot of dubstep, techno, or hardcore but there is a LOT =
of stuff available to us and we WILL get you those promos that sell out =
online before you can snag them - so if you place an order we'll get it =
(genres like hardcore aren't releases every week - but some weeks there =
will be up to 10 titles). The important thing to remember is that these =
lists are mostly brand new releases and many of the tracks are not =
available anywhere else (including digital download sites) so if you are =
looking for vinyl copies of tracks you already know then just email and =
we'll find out if it is still available - records usually are out of =
print after 6 weeks so by the time it gets popular it may not be =
available anymore but we will do our best to get you what you need.=20


T-Shirts?: http://www.poo-bas.com/clothes/bbs_gear
We have some gear available from BBS including designs from Dieselboy, =
Norik, Matthew Hollister, Tristan Eaton and more. You will have to ask =
for them in advance, but we'll get them for you in less than a week :)=20

Sorry for the spam, and thanks for the time!=20

&gt; well I haven&#39;t been home but this certainly took a interesting turn..
I
&gt; think the best part about it was that everyword spun from that devilish
&gt; cunts half broken brain and posted here is absolutely nonsense.. way to go
&gt; dumb ass... your outlandish stories and retarded attempt to make me look
bad
&gt; have only proven that you are simply thee most pathological lier anyone
&gt; could ever meet.. if you think the pb-cle is stupid why do you still
&gt; subscribe? you have not only disrespected this list but have made yours
out
&gt; to be an over embelisher and much more jadded than expected lying whore
than
&gt; ever, truly this has been a great source of entertainment for me this
week..
&gt; I will be just sitting here in my usual &quot;bitch&quot;-like-manner
(LOL) waiting
&gt; for your next super grandiose response. The very thought of reading your
&gt; posts of great intellectual interest and superb honesty has me wanting
&gt; someone from the ol&#39;joint to just come beat me up for old times sake..
maybe
&gt; I can find this made up character &quot;George&quot; and possibly have him
come anally
&gt; rape me while I am reading one of your awesome posts.. then my life will
be
&gt; complete....
&gt;
&gt; BTW here&#39;s a good quote for yas &quot;I am so glad you aren&#39;t with
that stupid
&gt; whore Mandie anymore.. she freaked me out.. asking Allannah (my daughter)
to
&gt; call her mommy.. well anyways can you come pick up Allannah for the
weekend?
&gt; I have somethings to do for my nursing program and she wants to spend the

I

&gt; dumb ass... your outlandish stories and retarded attempt to make me look
bad

out
&gt; to be an over embelisher and much more jadded than expected lying whore
than
&gt; ever, truly this has been a great source of entertainment for me this
week..
&gt; I will be just sitting here in my usual &quot;bitch&quot;-like-manner
(LOL) waiting
&gt; for your next super grandiose response. The very thought of reading your
&gt; posts of great intellectual interest and superb honesty has me wanting
&gt; someone from the ol&#39;joint to just come beat me up for old times sake..
maybe
&gt; I can find this made up character &quot;George&quot; and possibly have him
come anally
&gt; rape me while I am reading one of your awesome posts.. then my life will
be
&gt; complete....
&gt;
&gt; BTW here&#39;s a good quote for yas &quot;I am so glad you aren&#39;t with
that stupid
&gt; whore Mandie anymore.. she freaked me out.. asking Allannah (my daughter)
to
&gt; call her mommy.. well anyways can you come pick up Allannah for the

&gt; I have somethings to do for my nursing program and she wants to spend the

Used to be?  Let me think....

I've been on this list about a month.

But I recall being on it briefly ....about 9 years ago.

In fact, I KNOW it was the brief time I spent on this list years ago which
permanently changed my music tastes, and inspired me to continue
going to well over a 100 events since that time.

I poked around the pb-cle archives and found my 1st post,
a review I wrote of an event called Sonic Beats (March 20th, 1999.)

Pretty much my 1st rave.

Felling somewhat sentimental, I thought I'd repost that review.

I was 39 years old at the time, and through my eyes, this is what it was like.

(Brian, I recall you were there.)

***********************************************************

 
Ah, what the hell, I'll make a few
comments about this party.  Let me
preface this with the clear
statement I know very little about raves and
music.  I do not aspire to fit in and I don't belong at parties because
of
my rather advanced age.  I'm just looking for leads on current music
I like
and passing time during a little
hiatus from corporate life.
 
So if reading comments from a
clueless individual annoys you...hit the
DELETE button.

Took off from Cleveland by myself
pondering the thought of dropping by the
pre-party but decided this wasn't a
good idea because I don't know anyone
and since I look a like an FBI
agent, it'd probably be a rather awkward
situation.  I don't imagine kidz want to party with someone as old as their
parents anyway.   Got fucking lost looking for the venue
because of the
weird interchange onto Morse which
turned me around where I lost my
perception of East and West.
 
Finally finding the venue, I was
pleased with the free parking and noted it
seemed like a safe area where I
could probably expect to still have a CD
player when I returned to my car
(unlike some places in Cleveland).
 
The venue was huge and arcane being
a paint-ball facility looking like a
warehouse inside.  I liked the darkness, the strange rooms
surrounding the
huge main area, and the junk cars
along the walls.   Definitely had a
gritty
underground feel to it.
 
7up was spinning when I arrived but
I don't really recall that much of the
set.  I still struggle to define genres of music but the set seemed not
too
distinct to me.  Probably because it takes a bit of time for
me to focus my
attention on the music.  Noticed a large pool of vomit on the dance
floor
and thought this bodes well for an
interesting evening because I like
spectacles and think autoracing
would be boring without a few crashes now
and then to liven things up.  Just as no permanent damage is suffered
among
the willing participants.
 
Terrance Parker started spinning
what I assume was house which I mostly
dislike but he pulled off a few good
pieces.  I kinda dug the deal with him
using a phone for a headset but then
again, maybe he's taking mixing
instructions from some remote
location or just chatting with a friend while
he spins.
 
Decided to scope out the venue and
for once pay attention to something other
than the music because of some of
the posts on this list that bitch about
stuff not directly connected with
what is being played.  Watched some big
baby faced country boy taking a long
ass draw off a Vicks and asked him if
he had a bad cold to which he
replied, "No, it expands my lungs, you should
try it, expand your mind".  Having never seen this advertised as a side
benefit of using this medication, I
took note of the fact and will keep it
in mind next time I come down with a
cold.
 
Having a bit of stomach grind from a
25 mg ephedrine tablet (legal), went to
get some water.  Ran into a dude in line who just gave me one
out of the
goodness of his heart.  A very nice gesture considering it was 2
bucks.  I
wonder if the people selling these
bottles were giving them away to certain
individuals they liked and I just
happened to be on the receiving end of
this kindness.  Checked out the tapes being sold and didn't
see any I was
looking for and don't know most of
the names anyway.
 
Watched one sweep by two cops
through the crowd where they'd creep up and
shine the big Maglight on folks
business and thought "man, cops always get
to do neat shit".  They were probably enjoying the 'watch the
fuck' startled
look on kids faces looking up into
the Maglight doing their rounds through
the crowd.
 
The lighting was around 8
technobeams which did a fairly good job of
lighting the main area yet left
enough darkness along the walls for people
to chill out and do whatever they
were doing.  I decided to take a break
from DJ watching and sit along the
wall and see what was going on.  They
had
laid plastic sheeting over what was
apparently sloped mounds of dirt against
the walls.  It was rather crowded by I found a place to sit and contemplate
the situation and wonder what the
hell I was doing there.
 
Ah, yes, now I know what people have
been saying about people getting zoned
out, not dancing, and not
contributing to the vibe.  To the left
of me were
a line up of 7 dudes laid out
side-by-side like sausages, leaning back on
the plastic sheets, dustmasks on
face.  Damn, would have made a great
picture for the next 20/20 expose on
the decay of American youth.  People
seemed oblivious to my presence, and
did daisy-chain backrubs.  Is this to
counter some side-effect of a drug
or just tradition?  Don't know.
 
Went to the bathroom which was I
VERY interesting experience.  Big line
and
tiny bathroom.  Once inside, noted the presence of a couple
girls hanging
out with their Keith Flint looking
boyfriends.  I pondered the thought of
trying to squeeze into the girls
restroom so I could fully understand the
desire to hang out in a very tiny
room with members of the opposite sex
urinating.
 
In this packed bathroom, looked
dead into the face of a whacked out kid,
eyes dilated, teeth clinched, and
shivering and recalled the Allen Ginsburg
poem "Howl"....
 
"I saw the best minds of my
generation destroyed by madness, starving
hysterical naked, dragging
themselves through the negro streets at dawn
looking for an angry fix, angelheaded
hipsters burning for the ancient
heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of
night,"
 
Suddenly thinking "what a
minute, EVERYONE in here is totally on a different
mental plane than me and they will
at any moment turn, look at me, and
repeat a scene out of "Night of
Living Dead" on my naive sorry ass,....I
enjoyed that sudden "who am I,
where am I" rush.
 
Briefly said hello to just a few
people at the netmeet and I continue to be
impressed by the sincerity and
friendliness of those on the list I meet.
I've come to think the people on the
list represent the most knowledgeable and
sincere folk at parties.
 
Upon returning to the main room,
found Scott Henry putting on a blistering
set that just blew me away like no
other I've heard before.  'Spinning
songs
with builds.  i.e., songs that build up speed and
gradually go off the edge.
You probably know what I'm talking
about.  The kind of stuff that builds a
crowd into a frantic frenzy of
waving hands, and then drops from super-fast
beats into a deep baseline.  ...I love that kinda shit.  it really makes the
body and soul move.' This played
perfectly into the hands of the partiers
who had formed a dancing circle that
was extremely entertaining to watch.
(close you're eyes and you can
imagine it)
 
Although I rarely dance, this was
one set that could not be resisted.  Once
wrung out and sweating, a couple
kids come up and tell me they think it's
cool that some old guy would want to
come to a party, that I should spread
the word about what is going on.
 
Exhausted, Terry Mullen, although
sounding good, could not keep me from
thinking about that drive back to
Cleveland. I left.
 
Driving back, I watched the sun come
up while I listened to Autechre which
put the image of bugs swarming in my
mind all the way back home.
 
That was my experience at Sonic
Beats, just being honest ya know.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">preface this with the clear statement I know very little about raves and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">music.<span>&nbsp; </span>I do not aspire to fit in and I don&#39;t belong at parties because of</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">my rather advanced age.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&#39;m just looking for leads on current music I like</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">and passing time during a little hiatus from corporate life.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">So if reading comments from a clueless individual annoys you...hit the</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">DELETE button.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Took off from Cleveland by myself pondering the thought of dropping by the</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">pre-party but decided this wasn&#39;t a good idea because I don&#39;t know anyone</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">and since I look a like an FBI agent, it&#39;d probably be a rather awkward</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">situation.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don&#39;t imagine kidz want to party with someone as old as their</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">parents anyway.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Got fucking lost looking for the venue because of the</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">weird interchange onto Morse which turned me around where I lost my</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">perception of East and West.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Finally finding the venue, I was pleased with the free parking and noted it</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">seemed like a safe area where I could probably expect to still have a CD</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">player when I returned to my car (unlike some places in Cleveland).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The venue was huge and arcane being a paint-ball facility looking like a</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">warehouse inside.<span>&nbsp; </span>I liked the darkness, the strange rooms surrounding the</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">huge main area, and the junk cars along the walls.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Definitely had a gritty</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">underground feel to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">7up was spinning when I arrived but I don&#39;t really recall that much of the</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">set.<span>&nbsp; </span>I still struggle to define genres of music but the set seemed not too</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">distinct to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Probably because it takes a bit of time for me to focus my</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">attention on the music.<span>&nbsp; </span>Noticed a large pool of vomit on the dance floor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">and thought this bodes well for an interesting evening because I like</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">spectacles and think autoracing would be boring without a few crashes now</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">and then to liven things up.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just as no permanent damage is suffered among</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">the willing participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Terrance Parker started spinning what I assume was house which I mostly</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">dislike but he pulled off a few good pieces.<span>&nbsp; </span>I kinda dug the deal with him</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">using a phone for a headset but then again, maybe he&#39;s taking mixing</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">instructions from some remote location or just chatting with a friend while</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">he spins.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Decided to scope out the venue and for once pay attention to something other</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">than the music because of some of the posts on this list that bitch about</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">stuff not directly connected with what is being played.<span>&nbsp; </span>Watched some big</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">baby faced country boy taking a long ass draw off a Vicks and asked him if</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">he had a bad cold to which he replied, &quot;No, it expands my lungs, you should</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">try it, expand your mind&quot;.<span>&nbsp; </span>Having never seen this advertised as a side</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">benefit of using this medication, I took note of the fact and will keep it</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">in mind next time I come down with a cold.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Having a bit of stomach grind from a 25 mg ephedrine tablet (legal), went to</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">get some water.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ran into a dude in line who just gave me one out of the</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">goodness of his heart.<span>&nbsp; </span>A very nice gesture considering it was 2 bucks.<span>&nbsp; </span>I</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">wonder if the people selling these bottles were giving them away to certain</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">individuals they liked and I just happened to be on the receiving end of</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">this kindness.<span>&nbsp; </span>Checked out the tapes being sold and didn&#39;t see any I was</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">looking for and don&#39;t know most of the names anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Watched one sweep by two cops through the crowd where they&#39;d creep up and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">shine the big Maglight on folks business and thought &quot;man, cops always get</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">to do neat shit&quot;.<span>&nbsp; </span>They were probably enjoying the &#39;watch the fuck&#39; startled</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">look on kids faces looking up into the Maglight doing their rounds through</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The lighting was around 8 technobeams which did a fairly good job of</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">lighting the main area yet left enough darkness along the walls for people</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">to chill out and do whatever they were doing.<span>&nbsp; </span>I decided to take a break</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">from DJ watching and sit along the wall and see what was going on.<span>&nbsp; </span>They had</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">laid plastic sheeting over what was apparently sloped mounds of dirt against</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">the walls.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was rather crowded by I found a place to sit and contemplate</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">the situation and wonder what the hell I was doing there.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Ah, yes, now I know what people have been saying about people getting zoned</span></p>

Awesome.  I WAS there.  it was quite a blasty blast.  I think it was 
at sonic beats that I found out the exact wrongh combination of 
ephedrene, pseudoephedrine, caffeine and whatever the hell else was 
in a 2 liter bottle of Surge.  (oh how I miss that stuff!)

Kyle.  email me off the list :P

Used to be?&nbsp; Let me think....<br><br>
I've been on this list about a month.<br><br>
But I recall being on it briefly ....about 9 years ago.<br><br>
In fact, I KNOW it was the brief time I spent on this list years ago
which<br>
permanently changed my music tastes, and inspired me to continue<br>
going to well over a 100 events since that time.<br><br>
I poked around the pb-cle archives and found my 1st post,<br>
a review I wrote of an event called Sonic Beats (March 20th,
1999.)<br><br>
Pretty much my 1st rave.<br><br>
Felling somewhat sentimental, I thought I'd repost that review.<br><br>
I was 39 years old at the time, and through my eyes, this is what it was
like.<br><br>
(Brian, I recall you were there.)<br><br>
***********************************************************<br><br>
<br>
Ah, what the hell, I'll make a few comments about this party.&nbsp; Let
me<br>
preface this with the clear statement I know very little about raves
and<br>
music.&nbsp; I do not aspire to fit in and I don't belong at parties
because of<br>
my rather advanced age.&nbsp; I'm just looking for leads on current music
I like<br>
and passing time during a little hiatus from corporate life.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So if reading comments from a clueless individual annoys you...hit
the<br>
DELETE button.<br><br>
Took off from Cleveland by myself pondering the thought of dropping by
the<br>
pre-party but decided this wasn't a good idea because I don't know
anyone<br>
and since I look a like an FBI agent, it'd probably be a rather
awkward<br>
situation.&nbsp; I don't imagine kidz want to party with someone as old
as their<br>
parents anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Got fucking lost looking for the venue
because of the<br>
weird interchange onto Morse which turned me around where I lost my<br>
perception of East and West.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Finally finding the venue, I was pleased with the free parking and noted
it<br>
seemed like a safe area where I could probably expect to still have a
CD<br>
player when I returned to my car (unlike some places in Cleveland).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The venue was huge and arcane being a paint-ball facility looking like
a<br>
warehouse inside.&nbsp; I liked the darkness, the strange rooms
surrounding the<br>
huge main area, and the junk cars along the walls.&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitely
had a gritty<br>
underground feel to it.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
7up was spinning when I arrived but I don't really recall that much of
the<br>
set.&nbsp; I still struggle to define genres of music but the set seemed
not too<br>
distinct to me.&nbsp; Probably because it takes a bit of time for me to
focus my<br>
attention on the music.&nbsp; Noticed a large pool of vomit on the dance
floor<br>
and thought this bodes well for an interesting evening because I
like<br>
spectacles and think autoracing would be boring without a few crashes
now<br>
and then to liven things up.&nbsp; Just as no permanent damage is
suffered among<br>
the willing participants.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Terrance Parker started spinning what I assume was house which I
mostly<br>
dislike but he pulled off a few good pieces.&nbsp; I kinda dug the deal
with him<br>
using a phone for a headset but then again, maybe he's taking mixing<br>
instructions from some remote location or just chatting with a friend
while<br>
he spins.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Decided to scope out the venue and for once pay attention to something
other<br>
than the music because of some of the posts on this list that bitch
about<br>
stuff not directly connected with what is being played.&nbsp; Watched
some big<br>
baby faced country boy taking a long ass draw off a Vicks and asked him
if<br>
he had a bad cold to which he replied, &quot;No, it expands my lungs, you
should<br>
try it, expand your mind&quot;.&nbsp; Having never seen this advertised
as a side<br>
benefit of using this medication, I took note of the fact and will keep
it<br>
in mind next time I come down with a cold.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Having a bit of stomach grind from a 25 mg ephedrine tablet (legal), went
to<br>
get some water.&nbsp; Ran into a dude in line who just gave me one out of
the<br>
goodness of his heart.&nbsp; A very nice gesture considering it was 2
bucks.&nbsp; I<br>
wonder if the people selling these bottles were giving them away to
certain<br>
individuals they liked and I just happened to be on the receiving end
of<br>
this kindness.&nbsp; Checked out the tapes being sold and didn't see any
I was<br>
looking for and don't know most of the names anyway.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Watched one sweep by two cops through the crowd where they'd creep up
and<br>
shine the big Maglight on folks business and thought &quot;man, cops
always get<br>
to do neat shit&quot;.&nbsp; They were probably enjoying the 'watch the
fuck' startled<br>
look on kids faces looking up into the Maglight doing their rounds
through<br>
the crowd.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The lighting was around 8 technobeams which did a fairly good job of<br>
lighting the main area yet left enough darkness along the walls for
people<br>
to chill out and do whatever they were doing.&nbsp; I decided to take a
break<br>
from DJ watching and sit along the wall and see what was going on.&nbsp;
They had<br>
laid plastic sheeting over what was apparently sloped mounds of dirt
against<br>
the walls.&nbsp; It was rather crowded by I found a place to sit and
contemplate<br>
the situation and wonder what the hell I was doing there.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Ah, yes, now I know what people have been saying about people getting
zoned<br>
out, not dancing, and not contributing to the vibe.&nbsp; To the left of
me were<br>
a line up of 7 dudes laid out side-by-side like sausages, leaning back
on<br>
the plastic sheets, dustmasks on face.&nbsp; Damn, would have made a
great<br>
picture for the next 20/20 expose on the decay of American youth.&nbsp;
People<br>
seemed oblivious to my presence, and did daisy-chain backrubs.&nbsp; Is
this to<br>
counter some side-effect of a drug or just tradition?&nbsp; Don't
know.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Went to the bathroom which was I VERY interesting experience.&nbsp; Big
line and<br>
tiny bathroom.&nbsp; Once inside, noted the presence of a couple girls
hanging<br>
out with their Keith Flint looking boyfriends.&nbsp; I pondered the
thought of<br>
trying to squeeze into the girls restroom so I could fully understand
the<br>
desire to hang out in a very tiny room with members of the opposite
sex<br>
urinating.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In this packed bathroom, looked dead into the face of a whacked out
kid,<br>
eyes dilated, teeth clinched, and shivering and recalled the Allen
Ginsburg<br>
poem &quot;Howl&quot;....<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness,
starving<br>
hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at
dawn<br>
looking for an angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the
ancient<br>
heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of
night,&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Suddenly thinking &quot;what a minute, EVERYONE in here is totally on a
different<br>
mental plane than me and they will at any moment turn, look at me,
and<br>
repeat a scene out of &quot;Night of Living Dead&quot; on my naive sorry
ass,....I<br>
enjoyed that sudden &quot;who am I, where am I&quot; rush.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Briefly said hello to just a few people at the netmeet and I continue to
be<br>
impressed by the sincerity and friendliness of those on the list I
meet.<br>
I've come to think the people on the list represent the most
knowledgeable and<br>
sincere folk at parties.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Upon returning to the main room, found Scott Henry putting on a
blistering<br>
set that just blew me away like no other I've heard before.&nbsp;
'Spinning songs<br>
with builds.&nbsp; i.e., songs that build up speed and gradually go off
the edge.<br>
You probably know what I'm talking about.&nbsp; The kind of stuff that
builds a<br>
crowd into a frantic frenzy of waving hands, and then drops from
super-fast<br>
beats into a deep baseline.&nbsp; ...I love that kinda shit.&nbsp; it
really makes the<br>
body and soul move.' This played perfectly into the hands of the
partiers<br>
who had formed a dancing circle that was extremely entertaining to
watch.<br>
(close you're eyes and you can imagine it)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Although I rarely dance, this was one set that could not be
resisted.&nbsp; Once<br>
wrung out and sweating, a couple kids come up and tell me they think
it's<br>
cool that some old guy would want to come to a party, that I should
spread<br>
the word about what is going on.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Exhausted, Terry Mullen, although sounding good, could not keep me
from<br>
thinking about that drive back to Cleveland. I left.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Driving back, I watched the sun come up while I listened to Autechre
which<br>
put the image of bugs swarming in my mind all the way back home.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
That was my experience at Sonic Beats, just being honest ya know.<br>

Experimedia - record label + mailorder shop

OCTOBER NEWS ROUNDUP FROM EXPERIMEDIA
http://expperimedia.net
---------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPERIMEDIA MAILORDER SHOP EXPANSION:
The Experimedia online mail order shop has recently expanded to
include titles from fine select labels from around the globe. Titles
are now available from 12k/line, Non Visual Objects, Room40,
Audiobulb, Dragon's Eye, Spekk, and/OAR, Gears of Sand...and more on
the way from Nexsound, 1000f=FCssler, and Infraction.  These are some of
our favorite labels here at Experimedia and we personally recommend
all the titles we carry.  Our goal with this expansion is to showcase
and make conveniently available titles from our favorite labels in a
single online ship. The list of labels we stock will surely grow and
as time goes on we will post things such as featured
releases/labels/artists, radio shows, profiles, news and updates from
the labels we carry, and so on.  Available throughout the shop are
audio previews and third party reviews for most titles. We hope you
will support Experimedia's expansion into this territory.  Thank you!

Marker on the German label Gruenrekorder.

VRYASHN REVIEW IN THE WIRE (OCTOBER)
A very flattering review of Jeremy Bible & Jason Henry's album Vryashn
on Gears of Sand...this time by the respected uk print magazine The
Wire. "2008 is shaping up to be a busy year for the Ohio duo - three
albums have appeared over the last few months, and another four are
scheduled before the end of the year.  And if they're all as immersive
and incantatory as Vryashn, we're in for a treat.  Schematically, this
record is as simple as it gets - two lengthy, sonorous tracks clocking
in at a total of 50 minutes - but the closer you look, the more
complex things get, with looming, viscous currents offset by a
seductive parade of pattering detail. Fluttering piano notes pierce
shifting planes of texture, catspaws of white noise skip across the
swell, and Echoplexed flurries float, like distant birdsong, back and
forth across the threshold of audibility.  Vryashn reveals a perfect
balance between fluidity and architecture before disappearing into a
haze of chiming bells."
