Subject: Re: {pb-cle} CD Decks...

I picked up two axis 9's last night. I can barely tell the differance from 
tech 1200 and these. The pitch is a little more sensitive when set at +12 but 
drop it to six and the changes are very accurate and easy to get a descent 
lock. the jog wheel adjustments are just awesome. Overall it was more 
enjoyable working the with the cd decks then with my TT but thats probably 
because they are new :)

Subject: {pb-cle} American and Canadian Officials Bust Drug Ring

-------------------------------1080828759
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

WASHINGTON (March 31) - A U.S.-Canadian drug trafficking ring believed 
responsible for 15 percent of all the Ecstasy smuggled into America has been wiped 
out, authorities said Wednesday. They announced arrests and criminal charges 
against 170 people.
At its height, the ring distributed 1 million Ecstasy tablets per month in 
the two countries and laundered $5 million a month using travel agencies and 
bank transfers in the United States and Vietnam, officials said.
Drug Enforcement Administration chief Karen Tandy said the two-year 
investigation culminated in the arrests of nearly the entire trafficking operation, 
from leaders to couriers.
''We wiped out this entire organization,'' Tandy said at a news conference.
Ecstasy, or MDMA, is a synthetic controlled substance known originally as a 
''club drug'' because of its popularity at gatherings called ''raves'' and 
dance clubs. It has spread to high schools and colleges, with an estimated 3.2 
million people using the drug in 2002, according to the DEA.
It was once thought of as a harmless drug. But research has found that 
prolonged, heavy use of Ecstasy can cause confusion, depression, anxiety, aggressive 
and impulsive behavior, and memory loss, according to the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse.
Its popularity has caught the attention of an increasing range of criminal 
enterprises, largely because of the big profits. Pills sold at about $4 apiece 
wholesale in the operation typically cost $15 to $20 each on the street.
The organization targeted by U.S. and Canadian authorities consisted largely 
of people with Asian backgrounds, according to court documents. The alleged 
ringleaders were Ze Wai Wong, 46, a Chinese citizen, and Mai Phuong Le, 38, a 
Vietnamese citizen. Wong was arrested in Toronto and Le in Ottawa.
They operated three labs in Canada, which were discovered and dismantled in 
August, authorities said. The pills often were smuggled across the U.S. border 
or inside Canada in compartments within vehicle gas tanks, making the drugs 
hard to detect, particularly for drug-sniffing dogs.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday unanimously ruled that government agents have 
broad authority to search and even dismantle vehicle gas tanks to combat 
smuggling at U.S. borders.
The ring also used hidden gas tank compartments to transport cash. In one 
instance, the search of a vehicle headed for Canada in Burlington, Vt., yielded 
$750,000 in U.S. currency concealed in the compartment.
Authorities said the Wong-Le organization differs from previous Ecstasy 
trafficking groups because it is the first known to have manufactured the pills on 
a large scale in North America. The main sources of Ecstasy previously have 
been the Netherlands and Belgium.
These methods, said Deputy Attorney General James Comey, are ''a signal to us 
that, as we feared, the profits available in Ecstasy are attracting new 
traffickers and new ways of trafficking.''
U.S. and Canadian charging documents accuse Wong of leading a drug 
distribution ring in 18 U.S. cities and Canada and contend that Le orchestrated the 
laundering of drug money for the operation. They and the others are charged with a 
lengthy list of counts including conspiracy to distribute Ecstasy and 
operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
The organization also trafficked in Canadian-grown marijuana, known as ''BC 
Bud,'' and was involved in identity theft and other criminal enterprises, 
officials said. Raf Souccar, drug chief for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said 
eight marijuana-growing operations were shut down Wednesday in the Ottawa 
area.
Of those charged in arrest warrants, about 145 had been arrested as of 
Wednesday afternoon. Arrest and search warrants were executed in 16 American cities, 
with Canadian authorities serving 50 arrest warrants in Ottawa, Toronto and 
Montreal.
Arrests were made in these U.S. cities: Houston; Los Angeles; San Francisco; 
Oakland, Calif.; San Jose, Calif.; Jacksonville, Fla.; New Orleans; Baton 
Rouge, La.; Mobile, Ala.; New York; Boston; Atlanta; Alexandria, Va.; Des Moines, 
Iowa; Minneapolis and Salt Lake City.

Yes you shall not thwart our global take over!
Soon the whole world will be within our grasps.
Canada  will not save you! We will simply print and issue new maps that have 
Mexico and Canada as part of the us. No invasion we are just going to assume 
control so you are going to need to hide over seas :)

Hide your women in children! 

We are the republican party resistance is futile!

If you think the Reb party is trying to release electronic voting machines in

No, I'm sure they have better, less obvious ways of fixing elections, but
having Diebold's owner practically riding around on a big elephant is
certainly in poor taste.
And did you mean to call them the "Reb" party?  If not, it's an
interesting Freudian slip.

Dude you really belive that the republican party is trying to get electronic 
voting in place so that they can rig an election?  Which is what we where 
talking about at least in the last couple messages of this thread..

I think velvete changed there cheese in an under the scope plot to slowly 
administred small doses of a mind control drug. It will be 50 years before 
its dectactable in our systems but by then we will all be under the control 
of the mole people. Really I read it on the internet.

I really mean this when I say i am laughing ...

 right now ...

 at you. :)

I knew exactly what you where talking about.
But decieded it would be easier to laugh and joke about how insane the thought 
is then to take a 50 post beating from just about everyone on the list. Its 
pointless to argue politics and even more pointless to entertain insane 
consipiracy theorys especially with you.

It doesn't even bother you that you just called roughly 50% of the country 
cheats and liars or stupid. This is why I laugh at you. This is why i suggest 
you get a tin hat.

I am not even going to bother contiuning this, arguing with you is akin to 
bashing your head into brick wall. I better things to do with my time.

I have had some really good politacal discussions/debates with some of the 
most intellegent people I have ever met that sit very far to left. The 
difference is that they are here in reality and there arguments are grounded 
in facts not obtained from biased source and simple speculation. They don't 
just sputter out FUD in an attempt to bash on the current administration 
because they are pissed off they lost.

You have had some good points and good arguments but this is as I said before 
insane and laughable.

The election was not rigged. But maybe you have more data and investigative 
skills then the people the investigated it. Maybe they are just dumber then 
you.

If your still mad go play on moveon.org.

Why do I always let this group bait me into discussions like this its like a 
200:1 ratio. Maybe I just like being pounced on :)

so what am i talking about?

ahh, insane conspiracy theories like the one im referring to that 
you apparently have no idea what im talking about.

so 50% of the country are sitting republican presidents? WTF are 
you smoking man? i was extremely specific in my comments, anything 
else youre reading into them is coming from your own head. 

and if you want me to make generalizations, ill call up to 99% of 
the country cheats liars or idiots. thats not below me. 

>I am not even going to bother contiuning this, arguing with you 
is akin to

go do some research on richard nixon since apparently you dont 
know who he is or what he did.

by "lose" do you mean "got more votes"? just wondering. theres no 
bashing going on, just the simple point that cheating has happened 
before, and to think it will never happen again is pretty fucking 
stupid. and the fact that a republican did the cheating makes the 
point ever more poignant. those trustworthy christians arent worth 
a fuck. 

>The election was not rigged. But maybe you have more data and

what are you even talking about ace?

yeah those conspiracy theorists at moveon.org are horrible. 

>Why do I always let this group bait me into discussions like this 
its like a

i dont know why i bother with political discussion on a raves list 
either. its pretty obvious that (aside from the people who already 
knew that the diebold guy was a hardcore bush supporter) few 
people read the paper or have any sense of history.

Um, no disrespect intended to you, but...

With electronic-only voting and no paper trail for a recount, how would you even KNOW if your vote
is being cast and/or recorded correctly?

Legitimate concern or no, if I'm not pulling a lever or punching a hole in paper, or even without a
piece of paper like an ATM receipt that I can put in a box somewhere, what's the difference between
voting for president and clicking on one of those "punch the monkey" pop-up banner ads?

Who needs a hat when it's a fact that Diebold is a giant supporter of Bush?

Subject: {pb-cle} Third Eye V.6 early info

Friday July 30    The Third Eye V.6  Cleveland, Ohio

Goahead presents a full psytrance lineup with
our friends from Chicago and New York.

S.O.T. (Synchronous Oscillation Technology)
T.O.U.C.H. Samadhi - Chicago
S.O.T(Igor) was transplanted from across the ocean nine years ago with
hopes to learn about this side of the world. At the end of his mission,
the
Mothership came to take him back, however alien frequencies of psychedelic
trance lured him in and changed these plans. Based in Chicago, he began
playing/producing with one goal in mind "...to see more people go ape-shit
on a dance floor!.. loose themselves and get reborn.." Igor is extending
the
T.O.U.C.H Samadhi healing energy to the Midwest; using soaring leads and
swinging basslines that are sure to keep you "oscillating" well into the
night.

Mp3's at:
http://synchronous.home.comcast.net/html/slide2.html

Dan Efex - Chicago
Dan Efex is well known for his ability to draw a frenzied excitement out
of even the mellowest of crowds. It is not uncommon to see fans packed
shoulder to shoulder, hands in the air, as he leads them through an
energetic and intoxicating journey on the dance floor. There are many who
consider him to be one of the founders of the Midwests trance scene, a
scene that is still strong and growing today. He was one of the first to
introduce the Midwest to the soaring build-ups and powerful explosions
characteristic of some of his styles of trance. But although Dan is
perhaps best known for his trance, do not be fooled -- he is as diverse as
he is skilled! His repertoire of past events includes sets with
progressive trance, psychedelic trance, hard techno, hard core, hard
house, slow breaks, tribal and ambient. He mixes it up and keeps it
interesting. His unfailing ability to read the crowd and know precisely
what to plug in ensures that he leaves no stragglers behind on his musical
excursions.

Ari D - New York/Russia - Goahead's NYC connection,
Ari has wide knowledge of the psytrance genre and that is evident in his
dj sets. Ari has been DJing since 1996, got hooked on psytrance in 2001.
Over the years Ari's sets have progressed to accent diversity of track
selection and variety of mixing techniques. Expect to get a proper taste
of psytekk,
progressive and full-on, all in a building blend of positive dancefloor
energy to get your smile & groove on.

Malachi - Goahead - Akron/Cleveland
Getting things started early.

Plus one more DJ to be announced.......

Yeah, seriously.  The new machines are supposed to remove any room for
error but they sound even sketchier to me.  And it's not like the owner of
the company doesn't have a right to support who he wants to, but he's been
quoted as saying some rather dumb shit that makes the whole thing very
suspicious.  If I was Bush and had his election record...well, I'd kill
myself, but first I'd tell Diebold's owner to shut the fuck up.
An honest question: will the new machines give you some sort of printout,
like an ATM receipt, as proof of your vote and who you voted for?

Here's an interesting analysis of the e-voting machines and their
vulnerabilities:

<http://avirubin.com/vote.pdf>

It's a fairly technical paper, so if you're not a technical type
person, some or most of it will make little sense to you. But it
DOES go into great detail  exactly what the problems are, and
lists out exactly where in the electoral chain there's risk of
tampering with the results.

I'm gonna pick on Colin cause he said it first (today)....

<<all politicians are dihonest. whay? because the ones who won't cheat are beaten by ones who will
and they never get past city coucil. sad but true.>>

I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, and with all due respect, Colin, this struck a nerve with
me. I think anyone who uses this mentality as a basis for not voting is guilty of the biggest
cop-out of all time, and i'm sick to death of hearing this from hundreds of people.

If you don't rail against the lies and vast leap in ethics going on right now, you are de facto
silently accepting the ass-fucking being handed to you on a daily basis by twisted dishonest and
immoral people who want to be elected to further their OWN futures, and your future be damned.

Look, if your co-workers lie about taking an extra 5 minutes of break time per day...if your kid
lies about taking the cookie from the jar, these things aren't going to hurt hundreds, thousands, or
millions of people.

But the people in power at the highest levels are not only blatantly screwing the masses, they're
personally attacking anyone who dares challenge them about said screwing. The reasons for doing this
are many, but not the least of which is because they KNOW FOR A FUCKING FACT they're screwing
people, and by changing the subject, they alleviate the need to lie about it.

Look at anyone who's challenged the Bush regime over the last three years. The conversation went
something like this:

Richard Clarke: "You've done X, Y, and Z wrong on A, B, and C dates..."

Bush Regime: "So, Mr. Clark, when exactly did you stop molesting your daughter and beating your
wife?"

By thrusting something so ridiculous in your face, they force you to address the absurdity of the
current claim, and in the process, manage to get the majority of the media and public to turn away
from the source of the issue at hand....the PEOPLE THEY'RE FUCKING.

If you don't vote against this because "all politicians are crooks and liars", then you're silently
consenting to the destruction of a nation.

And I feel bad for you.

Correct. Thanks to the McCain-Feingold (sp?) law regarding campaign finance, the limit is on DIRECT
contributions to campaigns.

Many comments on various posts

What the fuck does that have to do with bush rigging elections? Anyone can 
support anyone. I wasn't dispputing that. Just about every major company 
supports a canidate and just about everyone of them manufactures things.

So what!

This is what you said.

 The nixon thing did completely skip right over my head. But he doesn't 
refelect the party.   But  "the fuckers" was taken as the entire republican 
party.  Not to specifically nixon and/or bush. But whatever.

I just assumed your where referring to the 2000 election.
We have the electoral college for a reason so the popular vote doesn't decide 
the election nor has it ever and this is a good thing.

> few

reedin's dumb!
History is good. I dropped in on the nixon thing. As far as reading the paper 
well show me an unbiased paper.

I never said otherwise but as i stated above so what. I doesn't mean that it 
is an attempt to rig elections.

None taken i am vehmtly against electronic voting for a million different 
reasons but i was saying that its not as if its some plot  by the republican 
party.

And the laughing is because this list can take any topic about anything and 
twist it into some poltical bash against the current administration. 
Really if you think diebold is doing this as an effort to win elections for 
the Rep Party then you are insane.

I am done now. Not quite 50 posts but close. Not really one of them addressing 
the issue of diebold making machines to cheat elections but its been fun non 
the less.

Yeah, piss on Democracy!  The racist basis for a joke like the Electoral

Ok lets gets serious then and stop flamming over this voting topic and focus 
on this for minute. 


You don't seen anything inheritly wrong with a couple dense states deciededing 
the fate for the country country? You don't see how a couple corporate or 
special interest agendas could litterally take control? Granted it would be 
cool to say that the popular vote is accurate and would work but it wouldn't.

I don't know seems like entire states could be forgotten. Elections and issues 
would be debated and focused on a few key areas of the country.

Just seems even worse then the racist basis for a joke like the electoral 
college :)

the electoral college is a way for southern states in particular 
to negate black voters. usually the popular vote goes the same way 
as the electoral college, but this time it didnt. and look how 
many of the southern states were won by republicans.

IMHO it's quite the oposite.

See:

<http://www.house.gov/kucinich/issues/voting.htm>

If there's nothing shady going on here, then why would diebold
publish a manual of spin responses for its employees rather than
just examine the flaws and fix them? What reason could be behind
the denial of known flaws? Of special interest is:

=93Do not to offer damaging opinions of our systems, even when their
failings become obvious.=94 (pg. 10)

Could it be that something nefarious lurks in the hearts and minds
of diebold execs? Surely you can see that this is not what would
be considered normal 'good business practice'. So what's the
explaination?

Does the way this has been handled remind you of any particular
administration that just so happens to currently be in office?
Deny, deny, deny. spin, spin, spin. lie, lie, lie.

I'm not saying that there is DEFINITELY something going on behind
the scenes... but signs sure do point that direction, and the
party affiliation of the top brass in the company surely doesn't
help.

Yes, but not all major companies are manufacturing the machines that will count the votes that will decide who becomes president. They aren't pushing for machines that don't leave a paper trail either. Diebold is doing both.

>So what!

So what? So if it was a major Democratic supporter making the voting machines, Fox news would be having fits about it every night.

Touche'. 

However the difference is this. The Clinton administrations deny,
spin, lie episode was about getting a blowjob... Something that
shouldn't be important to anybody except hillary and possibly
chelsea. The bush administrations deny, spin, lie episode concerns
every_single_american, and a shitload of people in other
countries. Americans are dying every day in Iraq and Afghanistan
because of GW.

It's molehill vs. mountain.

And don't even get started with the 'clinton purgered himself'
arguement. Time will show that Bush and his cronies did nothing
but lie to the american people. I'm just waiting for Condy Rice to
take the stand infront of the 911 commission. It's going to be
fucking rich, because she will have to either:

1) commit purgery.
2) admit the truth.

And either one of those outcomes will be acceptable because it
will show the bush administrations ulterior motives weather it be
personal vendetta, personal financial gain, or outright
despotistic tendancies.

fucking rich, i tell you...

So WHAT? When the CEO of the company that manufactures voting machines writes a LETTER TO THE
REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE essentially stating that he's going to help deliver a Republican electoral win,
you don't see any conflict of interest there?

Yes, many companies manufacture things and many of those companies donate to political interests.

Most of them, however, don't directly involve manufacturing the tools to deciding who runs the
government of this country.

Don't kid yourself, Andy. The day EITHER of those things happens in some clearly defined,
defensible, legaly PROSECUTABLE way in the Bush regime, they'll be ice-skating on the River Styx.

There will be blame places, characters assasinated (or at least, attempted murder), hems and
haws...the Republicans on the committee will lob her softballs. And anything that COULD be
potentially damaging asked by the Democrats will be considered "executive privledge" and not spoken
about in public.

She'll be like Tron in that Chapelle's Show skit... www.hypnotyza.com/fif.jpg

But if you think for a second that her testimony is going to expose some sort of grand, wide
reaching truth about the negligence on the part of the Bush regime, I think you're going to be
really disappointed.

well, we're just going to have to agree to disagree then...

IMHO, the facts that are already known speak for themselves. The
damaging stuff is already out there, and skirting potentially
embarassing questions at this point is going to make the whole
crew look even worse and less credible than they already do. And
especially with such damaging allegations from Richard Clark to
defend.... It's going to be REALLY tough for Condy to dodge... It
would be one thing if it was kerry or some other high ranking
democrat making these allegations... But this is coming from a
Bush Administration insider... And one that has 30+ years of
distinguished government service, including compliments from
GeeDub himself of a job well done. That's a pretty damn tough
bullet to dodge...

Now thats not it all. I was a clinton supporter to be honest. I was just 
saying  that it not something directely related to the rep party. I am saying 
that most of it is hype just like with clinton. Its just FUD going back in 
forth. You guys can't even concieded that a vast majority of this is 
hype,lies,propragenda ,and politcal campaigning on both sides? That it just 
goes back in forth depending on who's in office.

I don't think so but I guess it how you take what I say.

Honestly, no. I was pulled into a meeting and didn't have time. But I will 
before responding to anything else.

The one thing I am not is someone that refuses to hear debate or refuses to 
change ones mind. All though I think I am rare. I think most people have a us 
vs them attitude and anything said is just bullets or shrapnel.

Want to send me more link by all means but I tend not to take much credit from 
news sites that baised in any direction. Not that your links were, like I 
said i have not even looked at them... yet.

American citizens dying in a foreign country, totally unproven to 
be related to terrorism, while fighting a so called "war on 
terror" is a lie, propaganda, or political campaigning? Does 
sending our troops to the country that doesn't have terorists help 
the war on terror? 

ALL of the 9-11 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia. why didn't we 
invade the Saudis? Answer: Because the bush family has been in bed 
w/ the Saudis for decades. It started w/ GeeDub's grandfather.

This isn't about being anti-republican. I'm registered as a 
republican. This is about crappy and dishonest leadership of the 
most powerful country in the world. If the democrats had done the 
same thing, i would be just as pissed off.

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight in Cleveland

Ryan is here. We hung out with him last night in the studio, and let me
say once again how impressed I am with his skills. We just about knocked
out an amazing remix in under two hours. This guy is going to go places
in the global scene and you don't want to miss your chance to hear him
while you can.

TONIGHT
FRIDAY, APRIL 2 
RYAN PAPA (stigma recordings, resident advisor, australia) 

additional DJ sets by: 
Jason Soditch 
Deviant 

cloud 9 lounge 
1299 W 9th street 
warehouse district 
$5 :: 21+ :: dress to dance 
www.headrushmusic.com for driving directions
AFTERPARTY location and details to be announced at Cloud 9  


Ryan's unique sound, fueled by smooth mixing and stylistic versatility,
ensures he is frequently playing at a wide variety of events across the
globe. He's house, he's breaks, he's progressive, he's tech. Whatever he
is, he's PHENOMENAL! 

Recently Ryan delivered his distinct brand of music with a highly
successful trip to Malaysia to headline "The Backroom" in Kualu Lumpur
as well as a trip with studio partner Jeff Drake to headline the House
Broken party in Tokyo, Japan. 

Further to his hectic schedule, Ryan also finds time to take his sound
interstate in his homeland of Australia, with a number of past
performances in Melbourne at Altitude nightclub as well as supporting
Cass at the Sabotage party in Sydney. Ryan can also lay claim to being
one of few Australian DJs to perform on the highly regarded national
radio show 'Mixup' on JJJ alongside Darren Emerson.

Subject: {pb-cle} Like free speech?

Right now our government is trying to fuck it's citizens out of their first 
amendment rights. They are trying to rewrite our constitution. They are 
trying to play God. Soon our congress will vote on a bill that will have the 
power to restrict what you see, hear, and read. They are trying to give the 
FCC the power to regulate what you watch on TV, hear on the radio, and read 
in papers and magazines. And they are going as far as restricting cable and 
satellite TV. We're supposed to be fighting the Taliban, not turning into 
them? If you've never stood up for anything that matters to you in your 
life, this isn't a bad time to start. There is a website called 
www.stopfcc.com . Go there and sign a petition to stop Satan (The Bush 
Administration), from fucking you out of your rights. If you are a 
registered voter, sign that bitch. It only takes about 10 seconds. I also 
urge you to educate yourself about what is going on with your country.

ratio was red one's label and i think there 6 releases on it, from what i remeber the first two releases by red one were solid, then it all went downhill.

i think ram is using frequncy & high lite to put out up & coming stuff now.

also just did a search on tarzan and here's some interesating info on who owns what:

ram - andy c & ant miles
liftin spirit - ant miles
ratio - red one
frequency - andy c & red one
high lite - andy c & red one

right. DIRECT. i mean, if you're on the side that
believes the bush regime rigged the vote, certainly
it's childs play to receive "illegal" campaign finance
and get away with it. hell, i'm sure the slippery
psy-ops snakes that tell them what to tell the press
would find a way to spin it so that ppl would buy it
even if it came out. there are no rules that can't be
broken.

damned if i do, damned if i don't. shit, for all i
know, kerry was planted by them. wouldn't be the first
time in history, and i wouldn't put ANYTHING past
these psychotic bots. still i'll probly vote kerry,
just in case i'm wrong, f.y.i. i'd feel guilty if i
didn't at least show that i don't support the bush's,
by voting against them, even though it probly doesn't
matter.

by direct they mean you cant give specifically to the campaign 
more than they say. those campaigns have to write up full reports 
on all spending and if it didnt add up people would be in bad 
shape. of course the mccain feinberg bill actually hurts the 
democratic party more than the republican party because the 
republican party gets lots of individual donors wheras the 
democratic party before this got alot from attorneys and 
corporations. now theyre scrambling to make up all the money that 
they lost.

laugh at garage band all you want...i think its great...its a great way for

the base code for logic.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} this is way too fun, and a little scary..

i think its total bullshit that the kerry and bush campaigns both had "war 
chests" in excess of 100million dollars each...i think there is a better way 
to spend 200 million dollars than on a presidential election

just think how many books and lunches that could buy for under funded school 
districts.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} this is way too fun, and a little scary..

im a fan of federally funding education, transportation improvment(a good 
passenger rail system), funding osha properly...and funding other programs 
for the good of society

politicians should have an election funds cap...like 100K for presidential 
canidates...50k for senate seats, and 25k for seats in the house.

it really sickens me that george bush and john kerry will probably spend 
enough money on tv ads in ohio to pay off the budget deficiet here...if 
these guys were really interested in the good of ohioians(and other 
residents in the rust belt)they'd be putting the money to better social use.

as much as i dislike m$ and gates...at least him and his wife contribute 
BILLIONS each year to education and feeding impoverished children.

another thing that really pisses me off is social security...if im never 
gonna see a social security check(everyone says it'll be broke in ten 
years)...why the hell am i funding it?

the only hope for america is a getting a liberterian into the 
whitehouse(never will happen tho)

Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

its amazing that after you go off on this long rant that your 
solution is a libertarian. those guys are jokers and arent into 
any of the shit you talked about. they like unchecked markets and 
other things that benefit the rich over everyone else. your 
policies spell out socialism at its best man. get with it.

luckily andy taped it so i got to watch it after i got back from the roots show. i was expecting it to be like all of the other shows about ecstacy, but i was surprised that it was very non-biased, and it actually told true facts about ecstacy. i especially liked how they had frankie bones and raymond roker(the publisher of urb) speak on the rave scene and the drug, they couldn't of interviewed anyone better. hopefully because of the truth that was stated in this documentary some ppl changed their perspectives on ecstasy....Amanda Von Schtupp <methylamine@pornstarstyle.com> wrote: > That was possibly the best report on Ecstasy I've ever seen.

Yeah, forreal. At first I didn't want to watch it because I figured it
would be the same old shite. But they ended up making both the DEA and
George Ricaurte look like jackasses. Very good indeed!

Subject: {pb-cle} MEDICAL MARIJUANA INTRODUCED TO OHIO!

--0-897542807-1080977689=:36651
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Friends:

NORML is pleased to announce that Rep. Kenneth Carano will soon introduce
medical marijuana legislation in the Ohio Legislature.

In order for the bill to have a realistic chance of passing, other
legislators in the state must hear from their consituents that they
support medical marijuana.  That is why it is vital that you contact your
representative and urge their support for this important piece of
legislation.  Please take two minutes to send your representative a
pre-written letter in support of this bill, by visiting:
http://capwiz.com/norml2/mail/oneclick_compose/?alertid=5462576

According to a recent Time/CNN poll, 80% of Americans support the medical
use of marijuana for sick and dying patients.  However, despite
overwhelming public support, too many elected officials continue to oppose
medical marijuana for fear of appearing "soft on drugs."  This bill is
about compassion for sick people, not the war on drugs.  If passed into
law, this bill would improve the lives of so many sick and dying people.

Thank you for your support on this important issue.  NORML will continue
to keep you informed when the bill is officially introduced in the coming
weeks.

Regards,

Kris Krane
Associate Director
NORML

Subject: {pb-cle} LAW TO PENALIZE DRUGGED DRIVERS FOR MARIJUANA

--0-538303250-1080978032=:38008
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Friend:

We're writing today because NORML needs your help persuading the Ohio
Senate to reject legislation that would amend state law to criminally
punish marijuana smokers for "drugged driving" simply if inactive
marijuana metabolites are detected in their bodily fluids - even if the
individual is neither under the influence nor impaired to drive.

Senate Bill 215, introduced yesterday by Senators Jeff Jacobson (R-6th
District) and Steve Austria (R-10th District), will make it a criminal
offense to operate a motor vehicle if a "person has any amount of a
controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the
person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine."

This legislation represents an all out assault on the marijuana smoking
community.  Because inactive marijuana metabolites (inert compounds
indicative of past drug use) remain detectable in certain bodily fluids,
particularly urine, for days and sometimes weeks after past use, this
legislation seeks to define sober drivers as if they were intoxicated.
Someone who smokes marijuana is impaired as a driver at most for a few
hours; certainly not for days or weeks.  To treat all marijuana smokers as
if they are impaired, even when the drug's effects have long worn off, is
illogical and unfair.

At a minimum, any state law targeting drug drivers should identify "parent
drugs" (i.e., THC), not simply inactive drug metabolites.  Further, the
law must have scientifically sound cut-off levels that correlate drug
concentration to impairment of performance, similar to the 0.08 BAC
standard that now exists for drunk driving.  There must also be assurances
that the law mandates any and all drug testing to be performed and
confirmed by accredited state labs using uniform procedures and standards.
"Zero tolerance" laws are neither a safe nor sensible way to identify
impaired drivers; they are an attempt to misuse the traffic safety laws in
order to identify and prosecute marijuana smokers per se.

Please take two minutes to contact your member of the state Senate and
tell them that S.B. 215 is neither fair nor sound public policy, by
visiting: http://capwiz.com/norml2/issues/alert/?alertid=5440841&type=ST

Thank you for your support on this important issue.

Sincerely,

Paul Armentano
Senior Policy Analyst

We have that.  It sucks.  It isn't so much lack of funding, but lack of 
results.  Take Washington DC.  It spends more money per student than 
anywhere else in the United States.  It produces almost nothing.

We had a really good rail system.  No one wanted it.  They want cars.

I agree, but those are pretty low.  $100k won't get you on the 
television more than a small handful of times.

Made me go look this one up.  :)

Kerry's collected 50 million in the first quarter of 2004, which is an 
all-time new record.  Clinton campaigned on $40 million, total.  Bush 
won on 50-ish, total.  This election has a *lot* of people wanting Bush 
out of office, and a lot of people wanting bush *in* office, so the 
fundraising is huge.

That aside, Kerry might make $100 million, or roughly twice the previous 
record for a canidate.  Assuming Bush matches that, that's $200 million.

The federal deficit for 2003 was $374.2 *billion*.  The deficit, minus 
that $200 million, that's $374 billion.  Damn.  Daaaaamn.  The 2004 
deficit?  $477 billion.  That's $477,000,000,000.00.

Prior to the Bush Administration, 9-11, and Iraq, the deficit was around 
half of that.

>>as much as i dislike m$ and gates...at least him and his wife 
> contribute BILLIONS each year to education and feeding impoverished children.

Gates is a really charitable motherfucker.  As much as people like to 
bitch about M$FT, Apple computer is 10x as bad for policies like 'not 
releasing source code' and the like.  Depends on what you consider 
wrong.  All that aside, big props to billg@microsoft.com.

>>another thing that really pisses me off is social security...if 
> im never gonna see a social security check(everyone says it'll be broke in 
> ten years)...why the hell am i funding it?

The federal government basically predicts that either the government 
quits or social security does, some time around 2019.  We're all funding 
it because old people ALL vote, and almost no young people do.  That 
means that canning social security is political suicide.

>>the only hope for america is a getting a liberterian into the 
>>whitehouse(never will happen tho)

The Libertarians have a great idea at the core; "do whatever you want, 
as long as it doesn't fuck with other people doing what *they* want."

The Libertarians have the worst implementation of an idea I've ever 
seen.  Their presidential canidates rarely come across as 'honest' or 
'likeable' in any way to me.  They support canidates just to fill spots 
for election day; they've supported idiots, crackpots, and worse.  They 
aren't in it to win; their strategy at the top level seems to be to get 
canidates into office to sway the major parties their way.  Which ain't 
bad, but still, ick.

 From reading the above, Nick, it looks like you want to vote 
'socialist' on some things (social use of funds) and 
libertarian/anarchist on others (no social security, no deficit, etc).

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} this is way too fun, and a little scary..

I think he meant the state of Ohio budget deficit.

Which, for 2004, is around 2 billion.

http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/budgetmap.html#oh

The only good thing about Bush right now is that the "great uniter" will
unite people to go vote his ass out or in office in possibly record numbers
for recent campaigns.  HOWEVER, although a amjority of the country (around
52%) register themselves as Democrats, people on the left are more likely to
be disenchanted with the government enough not to vote at all (myself
included for the most part).  Conservatives are more likely to get motivated
for an election.

Is that cause you told them you had to be home for early bedtime?
ROFLMAO...for those who were at Rewind late last night and know what I mean.

We'll try and make it out, but I'm fairly busy till almost 10:30-11:00, but

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Politics, goose style was RE: {pb-cle} this is way too fun, and a little scary..

This whole thread has me remembering back to my POL SCI 570: Theories of
Democracy class.

The class looked at different 'systems of democracy', how they were
structured in government, how they set up 'checks and powers', yadda yadda.
For the final, it was not a written test, but rather a thesis that you
worked on all quarter (Ohio state is on quarters, not semesters)... The
thesis? Write your own constitution for the United States.  Here's a brief
snippet of the factors that I wrote about, from memory, I wish very much
that I still had a copy of that paper.

I've always believed in the power of three.  If you have 3 people then at
any point in time, at least 2 of them have to agree one way or another when
faced with any dichotomous problem.

Upon the premise that government is elected to make decisions, you often
should not see many abstentions allowing the power of three to hold a check
and balance of it's own.

I.  Nine Leaders, or Presidents.  Three internal presidents that takes care
of homeland issues,  Three military presidents that takes care of all
business relating to national security (including being 'commanders in chief
in the time of war'), and three external presidents that focus on foreign
affairs, trade relations, and immigration policy.  These are the abstract
definitions for each of the three segments.

All three segments of leadership (internal, external, military) would vote
together on the approval of proposed legislation, 2/3 needed for agreement. 

Example:
Internal Presidents 1 and 2 vote yes. 3 votes no.
External presidents 1, 2 and 3 vote no.
Military Presidents 2 and 3 vote yes. 1 votes no.

Outcome: the legislation passes, with Internal segment and Military segment
fulfilling 2/3 requirement.  Notice that even though there were 5 of 9 votes
as no, 2 out of 3 segments voted yes.

The election of the leaders would be based on a system similar to the french
(ACK the FRENCH)... There is an election for each position, internal,
external or military.  The three persons receiving the most vote are placed
into office.  This way voters are better represented.  Presidents serve a 9
year term, non-renewable, with elections for each different presidential
position being held every 3 years.  (2000 Internal president 2003 External
President, 2006 Military president, 2009 Internal president, etc)

Example from last election... Say that Bush, Gore, and Nader were all
running for the Internal President position.  All three would have been
elected, and you could see that nader would have ended up being the swing
vote on a lot of decisions... 

I had this elaborate power of threes cabinet that pretty much made each
president have 3 cabinet members, it's really not too relevant, and quite
boring in the context of just worrying about the presidents.  This section
pretty much just alleviates the need for any 'vice president' types... And
brings in the condy rice's as advisors.

II. Legislation.
1 lawmaking body. A senate.  Three senators can be elected from every
250,000 person population area.  A minimum of 9 senators from any one state.
Election is the same was as for presidents, that on an election year, the
three top vote recipients are placed into the senate.

III. Judiciary Branch. The high court of the land.
9 justices, 9 year term never renewable, 1 justice appointed every year by
the collective of presidents.  All legislation approved by a majority vote
(5/9) before it becomes a law. This way, all three branches must concur on
the passage of a legislation.

IV. Misc
In the event of a presidential opening due to death or impeachment, the
legislation, executive, and judiciary branches will choose from the cabinet
advisors to fill that position.  I had a nice process for this which is too
long to put in this email.

___

What this means to the discussion?
It's pretty much a better alternative than the win or go home process we go
through already.  This way the voices of all voters are heard.  This way the
government actually has a check in place for itself at all points in time.
3 branches, executing by the power of three.  I believe this would really
bring out a killing for voting, because more people would think they really
did have a chance for Ross Perot to win a position.  This would bring more
power to the people, more dissolution of political parties, with more
diversity in platforms.

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Entropy's NASA review

Candace and I met up with Sara, Dani, Evan Sonik, and B at around 3pm.  
Got down to Chinatown at about 4:30, and
hopped on the 5pm Chinatown bus (Boston to NYC).  After a 4 hour journey, 
we arrived on Chrystie St (like the
Beastie Boys, heh) in Manhattan.  Walked down Canal and found 
Shelter/Arc.  Got in line for the party at about
9:45pm.  The doors opened at about 10:40pm, and we got inside within 20 
minutes.


Here's a rundown of the sets (of which I saw):


Odi in the back room - wikked 92 and 93 bizness.  Got me really goin right 
away!  Woo!

MOBY on the main floor! - Opened up with "Go!" and ended with "1000", and 
in between played some Altern-8, some 91
piano stompers, and a housey remix of "Porcelain".  Wikked set!  Very 
eclectic.

DB on the main floor - Some 91 and 92 bizness, varied between breakbeat 
and stompers.

DIMITRI (from Deee-Lite) on the main floor! - Very housey set, didn't hear 
much of it, but heard some classic 88-89
piano house anthems, good stuff.

Frankie Bones on the main floor - this was a bit questionable.  Harbored 
in the hard techno/early gabber area for a
while, which was cool, but then dropped some booty breaks??? and "Work It" 
by DJ Funk!?  I have no idea what that
was doing in there.  I got into some of his gabber-ish stuff, but then I 
took off and chilled in the back room for a
bit:

DB in the back room - Some more 90-91 goodness.  Solid set.

Soul Slinger in the main room - weird old skool housey/techno, all mashed 
up into the classic Soul Slinger style.
Didn't get into too much of his set, but he did play this wikked jungle 
tune at the end of his set ("Remember
when..........jungle had soulllllllll?")  :)

Scott Henry on the main floor - great anthemy 92 set, really energetic!  
Had a blast dancin to him!

We took a rest in the back room and coat check room for a bit before Odi's 
closing set in the main room:

Odi in the main room - Woohoo!  I love the last sets of a rave, they are 
always just ballstothewall!  Heard a couple
Hyper On E tunes, some Acen, some Seduction, some Andy C, wikkedness!


Met up with Darcy, Mike, Legba, Dean, and Jill!  Always good to see you 
guys!  *hugs*



Wikked night.  Total Hardcore Rave craziness.  Thanks to Scotto and the 
crew! Good stuff.  boh boh!




Top tunes for the night:

Far Out - Sonz of de loop de loop era (heard it 5 times!)
Hardcore Heaven - DJ Seduction (heard it 4 times!)
Close Your Eyes (optikifusion) - Acen (heard it 3 times!)
Trip II The Moon part 3 - Acen (heard it 3 times, heard part 1 once, and 
never heard part 2!)
Don't Go - Awesome 3 (heard it 3 times!)
Valley Of The Shadows - Andy C (heard it 3 times!)
Thunder Grip - Hyper On E (heard it twice!)
Music Takes You - Blame (heard it 3 times!)
Plastic Dreams - Jaydee (heard it twice!)
French Kiss - Lil Louie Vega (heard it twice!)

and of course tons and tons of Prodigy  :)


Few tunes I wanted to hear, but didn't:
The Horn Track - Egyptian Empire
Powerpill - Aphex Twin
Window In The Sky - Acen
Narra Mine - Genacide II
Fire When Ready (alternate version) - G Double E
Edge Of Darkness - Luna C
some Bizzy B or some heavy darkside

Next time perhaps!  ;)



And thank all that is holy and sacred, Odi dropped "Lord Of The Null 
Lines" (original mix) in his final set!!!

Wow I really should write these e-mails like 12 hours earlier; but its the
very end of the weekend that always makes me wish the most that I could
either start over at Friday or time warp to the next.  There's always so
many great things to do here in Cleveland!  All forms of music were
properly represented once again as there are always more events than there
is time.
 
I'll spare you all the details on all of the happenings since i know you
were all good scenesters and went out to have fun and support : )
 
I had the privilege of seeing a band from New York that plays live house
music.  They had the dance floor cookin' so hot that the fire alarm was
going off ; ) Mad props to Nitty Gritty for bringing them in!
 
Anyways, this week's installment of Beat Matrix features Experimedia DJ
Dan Mcleod.  Get your ears ready as our improved air signal will be
bringing out some maaaaaaaaaad electro vibes.
 
Experimedia and Molotov are bringing Sendex and $tinkworkx to the Abbasso
from Bunker Records in Den Haag Holland this Friday, April 9th.
 
Coming up on April 12th will be WRUW's annual fundraising telethon.
 
The Telethon is the only time of the year that the station generates
revenue and it bases its budget off of its telethon earnings.  Please be
sure to call in with your pledges during our show! The money you donate
will go towards maintaining and upgrading equipment at the station.  Past
telethon's helped to fund the power increase to 15,000 watts so that it
could bring the music to you in high fidelity audio!
 
This year WRUW is looking for even more ways improve its air signal and
quality of musical programming even further.  WRUW thrives off community
support.  By donating, you can help us bring the music to the masses!
 
::whew:: OK i'm out of breath now.  I'll catch you guys on the air : )

Subject: {pb-cle} Zia-Trance =?iso-8859-1?Q?/Boston=92s=2C_DJ_Lauryn_?=

Zia-Trance is now featuring a mix by Bostons, DJ Lauryn that manifests the
sacred feminine. Its a conglomeration of waves that form into bubbles of
pure spiritualized sound.

It makes me happy to feature one of my favorite local djs, who can always be
depended on to bring an amazing energy to the dance floor.

Professional mixing and empathetic track selection make this a must listen.
You should definitely check it out.

It airs everyday at 2 pm EST, and then again for the rewind at 10 pm EST.
You can check the scheduler on the main station page to see the times it
airs in your area. It converts the times for you.

It will air from 4/5 to 4/18.

Good luck and take care,
Bob Trahpek

Subject: {pb-cle} Super All U Can Eat Wing Night 

Ok so were talking about doing a Super All U Can Eat
Wing Night (SAUCE) after all that wing/beer
discussion.

Since we were thinking the 330'ers maybe able to join
we would thought to do this at the Cranberry Quaker
Steak and Lube. Our other option would be to go to
Robinson.

Tuesday, April 13, 2004
7 pm?!?!?

After Wings we can head over to Kelly's for some Funk
and Soul too. Who's in?

Subject: {pb-cle} Super All U Can Eat Wing Night 

Ok so were talking about doing a Super All U Can Eat
Wing Night (SAUCE) after all that wing/beer
discussion.

Since we were thinking the 330'ers maybe able to join
we would thought to do this at the Cranberry Quaker
Steak and Lube. Our other option would be to go to
Robinson.

7 pm?!?!?

After Wings we can head over to Kelly's for some Funk
and Soul too. Who's in?

perfectly on topic.  i can see ravers assimilating some of that.  VR 
already wants to make wristbands or something using tron technology. 
anyhow there was an offtopic list here, but people complained about the 
offtopic content there.  so i closed it in frustration from the whiney 
bitches.  no more whining and i sleep better at night.  now's your 
chance todd to plug yours.

true, but the Democrats aren't at THAT much of a disadvantage. The "new" soft money they're getting
from these "527" organizations (political activism groups that don't allign themselves directly to a
party, but are essentially mechanisms allowing party advocates to work "outside the system" and
still drive in the bucks) seems to be generating a lot of income and, incidentally, a lot of
attention from proponents of McCain-Feinberg. They're claiming that the soft money isn't really
going away, just getting more cleverly disguised.

LOL make a bill fight for it pass it then find a away around it so that its 
meaningless. That was a lot of wasted time. Not to mention it should have 
been squashed in court because of the 1st amendment. 

Its good they found a way to beat there own bill. Nothing like my tax dollars 
at wasted paying these guys to create useless shit.

LOL make a bill fight for it pass it then find a away around it so that its 
meaningless. That was a lot of wasted time. Not to mention it should have 
been squashed in court because of the 1st amendment. 

Its good they found a way to beat there own bill. Nothing like my tax dollars 
at wasted paying these guys to create useless shit.

I wasn't being partisan. My statement applied to everyone :)
It was a joke and a sad attempt at something that noone is really taking 
seriously. It was the wrong approach. 

It needs be done for sure but not like this. I am completely opposed to money 
driving politics. I am opposed to elections being goverened by who has more 
cash in the "war chest".

Anyone should be able to run and have a fair chance.
Media should be forced to give equal time for all candidates regardless of 
party but thats a little off topic.

lol its the thread that would not die :)

<<Anyone should be able to run and have a fair chance.>>

Well, I don't know about "ANYONE".

The LAST thing we need in this country is the "William Hung" phenomenon going into politics...

Then again, there are those that would argue that the 2000 election and current administration is a
result of that very thing...


<<Media should be forced to give equal time for all candidates regardless of party but thats a

1) Given enough time, politicians would find a way to abuse it and bend it to support their specific
agendas. That's just human nature, I think. Given enough time, anyone will figure out how to massage
a societal system to his/her benefit.

2) HA! Off Topic? Here? Pashaw....

ok so you use a party based model. Where you have to so many supporters in the 
party before it can be reconized. Then media has to give the same fair access 
(WITHOUT BIAS) to all of the reconized parties. Not perfect but it gives the 
public access to the parties they are interested in.

You basically you saying just fuck it? Any system is going to suck? naaa we 
just have to get a system that sucks less and isn't so motivated by special 
intresent and cash.

meets Vitalik
Interview by Machinelf

I first met Vitalik at the DMT ski lodge in the Poconos back in late 2000 and

since then he's re-energized New York's trance scene with the tasteful
progression of Omnitribe, starting with outdoor events in and around New
York,
continuing with events including those at Fun City and the Fencing School,
  and
culminating in the Omnifestival at Echo Lake in upstate New York in 2003.
 This
year the Omnifestival is back with Wizzy Noise live, Mos
Mittelstandskinder  Ohne Strom live, and Phony Orphants live, plus an Emok
dj set.

Where are you from?
still figuring that out, but was born on the island called Sahalin, Russia.

What's going on with you lately?
learning basics; rediscovering myself through letting go of fears; the
hardest part to accept myself as shitty as I am.

Does your name come from Vita, life?
that is where I am coming from!!! One thing that keeps me going is the
believe that there is a way to continue our journey into the world beyond
what we  know with our selfish minds. Trip is beyond psychedelic drugs and
beyond trance  music. Psychedelics opened it up for me and now it's all
about life,  experience and sharing knowledge.

When did you first hear trance music?
it all started with E as my girlfriend at the time brought me to the
S.U.N.  Project party at Mars 2112.

Where have you played as a DJ?
DJing from the mind I've staryted back in 2001 at the fresh open air
paties  here in Brooklyn. Slowly discovering myself as a DJ and maybe only
now coming  to some understanding of this art. I played around, but for
real when I was  really playing with it, only a few times: Neva bar, Roof
in Williamsburg, club  Mundo, Danny's loft and a gig in Philadelphia for
Gaian Mind monthly; Oh and of  course my studio where I manage to let go
quite often.

Are you doing a compilation anytime soon?
don't know much about the future. of course it'd be pleasure to release
something interesting and something I trully enjoy myself, so I'm working
towards  it. From the past, the compilation that I was working on for
Midijum Records  was put on hold. It was an experimental idea of releasing
USA trance artists  with some German acts, but America wasn't ready for
the quality that was  demanded. Must say that PolarLight Rec., NYC picked
up on that and will be releasing  something fresh from the local artists
quite soon.

My knowledge of Russian trance is limited to Parasense, Fungus Funk and Weird

Walker.  Is there a characteristic in the Russian character that has
influenced their flavors of trance?
It's hard for me to talk about it 'cause I found myself in trance here in
the  states and yet to have  experience of the Russian trance scene. From
my mind  I can say that Russian wilderness and freshness of the mind was
always  attracting attention of the world, so it shows in the music that
comes from there.  Some more projects of serious interst are Fuzzion,
Neoris, Overlap, Neogen, PPS  Project...I find a lof of Russian character
in myself and maybe the  unbreakable will is the one to notice.

Who are your favorite artists/influences? [trance or not]
People around me are of great influence, I learn from each and everyone I
am  in contact with. It's amazing how much we all have in common and how
much we  resonate. Talking about the trance scene of NYC, you Jeff is one
of my heros  btw :). From the trance world Pena (flow rec.), Noma (spiral
trax),  opened up  doors for me. X-Dream/Delta comes to mind as well.
Favorite artists, oh too  many to type.  Labels that released their tunes
are MPDQX Label group, Spiral  Trax, Spirit Zone, Plusquam, Midijum,
Iboga, Nano, Save to Disk, Free Form,  Z.M.A, Databass, 3D Vision ....

What turned you on to psytekk/minimal/progressive sound?  What are your
thoughts on this music?
Dima turned me on 'cause he'd erase all the other stuff from his hard
drive  at the time I was starting up as a DJ. Then as I moved towards
playing from the  heart I found beauty in the progressive trance and a lot
of melodies in the  minimal what you call psytekk. There are so much going
on in my head even if  there are not that many crazy sounds flying around.
:) Now I'm also collecting  some of the faster and fuller tracks for the
open air season. Playing outside  is totally different experience and the
speed limit sign is far below.

What are your future plans for Omnitribe?
oh with this group of people it is impossible to make plans. More like
catching moment after the moment. Still interested in promoting trance
music, so  working with labels to bring some fresh releases to the states.
Danila @  elekrolust.com is working with us on that idea, dedicating
himself to the selfless  approach to this matter. SUMMER is on the way and
for sure will be bringing free  parties to NYC. Just today I was exploring
new places, thinking of bring sound  system right to the footsteps of the
bay. waves, sand, isolation, salted  breeze and the sound of psychedelia.

Who would you most like to book that you haven't?
Oh about booking it is always sweet to dream, but in reality I'm out of
cash,  so I'm dreaming of different things at this moment of my life :)

Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?
A friend of my just came from Peru for a short stay. Very interesting and
fresh things are going on with him. Imagine a healing center on the last
point of  civilization in the rain forest of Iquitos (north of Peru). He
has devoted  his life on helping people to overcome sickness. He helped
this woman to get  over the cancer of the 'this long thing in human
stomach that refines food'. IT's amazing for me 'cause he's just a guy
like you and me with the same  abilities and the same understanding of the
world, maybe with the difference that  he has switched the focus from
himself to the other side. oh might know him,  it's Roman H.

I think we're about to get retarded tomorrow night.

If any of you guys havent seen these locals from Cleveland yet,.. please
come out and support them because theyre all AWESOME dnb djs, and probably
wont make it out for a long while afterwards. It took me a freaking year to
talk Rudy and Baxter into coming out, since they have work and schoo as well
as Brentl.

Also Stephanie C will be out with the new magazines *Bassline* if some of
you would like to check those out as well.

Well, really, that's not drastically different from today.

Remember, there's no law saying that America is a 2-party-only system. The 2 major parties have been
around long enough that the Darwinian model has essentially taken over and they're big enough and
strong enough to crush the other parties.

I'm not saying what we have now is perfect, but it still seems to be the best model in the world.

<<You basically you saying just fuck it? Any system is going to suck?>>

No, no, no...I don't have a major problem with the system as it is now. I was merely stating that
for every actionable change you suggest, over time, someone CAN and WILL find a way to exploit that
system for their own benefit. It's just plain sociology.

<<just have to get a system that sucks less and isn't so motivated by special intresent and cash.>>

Well, we don't know how much these things affected the foundation of our political system, but I
have to imagine that they've gotten progressively more effective over time. Hence my point - I don't
think the system is broken. It's just been around long enough for people to figure out how to
massage it to suit their own specific agendas.

I'm no poly-sci major, but I'm sure that we can sit down in front of a world political history book
and I can show you how, throughout each and every government throughout the world, despite the
loftiest of ideals, the powerful in every scenario got there and stayed there by exploiting their
respective governmental structure systems.

When was the last time the libertaraian party or any party other then our two 
was given the same fair press coverage thats what I am talking about. Can we 
vote and be informed if we can't hear the debate. I agree our system works 
well but i don't like how the media gets to filter and spin my information. 
Censur ideas from groups that are not as wealthy as the big two. Then if you 
inform yourself its still pointless because its just you and you alone or 
never going to get a 3rd candiate elected. The media controls that. So you 
are a foul to vote outside. so you draw up a list of what each of the two 
parties is about and you check off what you believe and try and deciede if 
the issues you don't believe in are enough to out way the ones you do and 
then you vote that party line. So I am stuck with a bunch of religious nuts.

Then you canidates like bush that are so "morally" changed that he's suspect 
or you get canadates like kerry that really stand where ever he gets the most 
attention or votes whos platform is based on not being bush.
<I am not going to argue or debate the above paragraph its my oppionion>

Our two parties are falling apart the left is going way left and the right is 
going way right. The media has us at each others throats because its sells 
advertising space. I want to hear from the middle or from outside the current 
mindset. I know nothing is really going to change but it should.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dubplate Culture

Yo, Majestic....

Thanks for sending this email along. I'm really astonished more people didn't respond to this, given
the attention this issue got when Goose, Tom, and I brought it up a while back.

Coming from an "insider" in the scene, this document is simply astonishing...It is essentially a
count by count indictment of the DnB community on exactly what many people who used to love it see
as the "violence inherent in the system". (/monty python references)

Though he does it more eloquently, the author's statements mirror my own arguments from last month's
discussions on this "restricting" of music that just simply DOESN'T HAPPEN in other genres. This
paragraph was probably the most damaging:

<<"In reality Dubplate Culture only serves the deejays and producers, whose ideas of respect and
ones demonstrable value serve as a basis whether you, the fan, deserve their music. The idea also is
turned on its head when fledgling producers are trying to get the major deejays to play their music
in order to garner more exposure. Essentially ensuring unless you are somebody; you wont be
somebody.">>


I'd be interested in seeing any responses that people come up with for this, especially ones that
are given as much forethought and attention as this...article (?) was. Where was it originally
posted?

but today if you get the 10% of the popular vote or whatever it 
is, all you get is federal matching funds. so if you cant raise 
shit for money, the government doesnt have to give you shit. if 
that was changed to if you got 10% of the popular vote you got 
everything equal to the 2 parties now in power, THEN maybe 
something would change. thats why federally funded elections would 
be the bomb.

The libertarians, greens, and other major 'third' parties are all 
fucking crackpots.  Television stations don't give crackpots air-time. 
If a third party would come up that was close to the 'middle', and aimed 
for mild reform in a third direction, well, they'd stand a far better 
chance.

That aside, you can't claim that Ross Perot didn't get fair airtime.  As 
a third-party canidate.

The media filters and spins everything; not just politics.  And I don't 
have a good solution for that one...

Hey now!  I'm a hardcore Libertarian (been registered LP since I was 18), 
and I am certainly not a crackpot!

The Greens, yes, but not us LPers!

We stand for freedom, nothing more.

Right. Exactly. I am not sure why I was having such a hard time articulating 
that.  But thats just pretty much where I was going.

Also as far as the crackpots from the previous post I don't think that is fair 
since besides good old nut job perot no other party has been given a chance 
to speak there mind. So how can you classify anyone outside the system as a 
crackpot if you can't even watch a debate. How can we as a society progress 
if we have to deal with the same two choices. With the excpetion of the civil 
rights movement are country is pretty stagnent. We make a change the other 
side undoes and on an on it goes.

Julian Henkel (sp?) was the LP canidate for Attorney General.  Being he 
wasn't a lawyer, and wasn't qualified for the position, I went to see 
him speak.

He was either senile, a lunatic, or the worst actor I've ever, ever, 
ever seen.


Harry Browne (sp?, again) was the last presidential candiate.  He wasn't 
exactly a shining example of 'standing for freedom'.

That's assuming that politics are one-dimensional.  You know better than 
that.  Let me reword it.

Republicans are slightly right of middle.  Democrats are slightly left. 
  If instead of the libertarian party pitching a platform that was 
incredibly far away from the center between Democrats and Republicans, I 
think they'd stand a far better chance of being a major party if they 
started in the middle and took small steps towards freedom.

Currently, they seem to pitch an all-or-nothing presidential canidate, 
and that'll never fly.

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: Holy Sub

I would LOVE to have the chance to experience that listening room. Can
someone clarify what is up with these being called "horn" subwoofers?
There wasn't a clear definition on the website as far as I could see.

I realize that low frequencies are non-directional. Are they just
referring to the horn shape of the compression chamber? The efficiency of
those speakers just blows my mind. I would have thought 110db/1w/1m from
subs to be impossible. Evidently, this is not the case.

We have AMAZING candidates this year for the presedential election:

http://www.garynolan.com
http://www.badnarik.org
http://www.russoforpresident.com

It's lookin like we might end up with a Nolan/Russo ticket

Well, as far as the LP goes, we consider ourselves UP instead of left or 
right (as in the diamond of political spectrum)

Voting Libertarian isn't about WINNING A RACE, per se,, it's about taking 
votes AWAY from non-freedom-supporting candidates, like Bush or Kerry.  
When Bush loses this year because he lost 5% to the LPers, the next GOP 
candidate will HAVE to be more freedom-based in order to win.

Subject: {pb-cle} nrr: little help here

I'm still pretty shaky on linux, but i managed to set up a fedora 
core 1 box, and installed the rpm packages for squid (2.5 STABLE 
3)... i set up the squid.conf file (and installed a couple add on 
programs like squidguard and squid usage report generator)... the 
worst part is, i cant get the fucking thing to run.

i do a quick and dirty:

./squid -f /etc/squid/squid.conf -a:8080 

just to get the thing started (while being in the sbin directory, 
as root)... 

and nothing happens. i just get returned to a command prompt.

i dont even think it started up a process.

any ideas?  anyone use squid?  

any other proxy packages i should look into?

Problem is that some of the past canidates have been so damn bad that my 
confidence has been shattered.  My beliefs are hardcore libertarian, but

Oh, I know this; was just making sure you understood what I meant.  I 
think the Libertarian canidate should be close to the beliefs of the 
center, to have a shot at election time.  Having a candiate sitting in 
orbit just makes the LP look more cracked.

Hell, I can do that now; what you've just said is that voting 
Libertarian is equivalent to not voting.  Not

Well, as much as I would like to try to convince you to, I won't  ;)

I will say this though.  The most powerful thing you can do in this 
election (imo) is to register Republican and then vote Libertarian, to 
send a message to Bush that his statist BS is no good.

Well, I have faith that freedom eventually wins out in the end.  The LP is 
still in it's baby stages.  After the Free State Project happens, the LP 
will start to be taken VERY seriously, since we'll all be in the state 
with the first primary.

Not really. NOT voting sends a message that you don't support ANYTHING.  
That's a much different message than saying you DO support FREEDOM.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Re: Holy Sub

theres 3 basic types of subwoofer

1. direct radiating....this is where the speaker just faces forward and no 
scoops or chambers are used...most times a direct radiating box will have 1 
port per sub.

2. scoop bins...these are the classic reggae style bassbins....they are easy 
to tell because of the large "scoop" panel in the front....usually the 
driver faces cone out at the top...i cant think of any good commercial 
examples of this bin...but if u goto speakerplans.com you can see a diagram


3. bass horns...a bass horn is basically the famous cerwin-vega earthquake 
bin(ever popular at raves and clubs)...the internals of these types of subs 
are very complicated and require a good steady hand to get all the pieces 
glued and screwed together...again if you goto speakerplans.com you can see 
diagrams.


now a free production tip....get sound forge...goto tools...simple 
synthesis...change the wave to sine...set the frequency to 63hz and the 
length to 2 seconds...save the wav...load the newly created wave into your 
sampler of choice(lately ive been using nnxt)...load about 6 of those waves 
into it...leave the first one at the original pitch...start detuning the 
other 5 by -1 cent(ie...sin2 -1, sin3 -2, sin4 -3, sin5 -4, sin6 -5)

now play a key.....wall shaking bass...now throw a compressor on the output 
of the sampler...set the attack ot about 15ms and the release to 5ms...set 
the ratio to 4:1 and the and play with the threshold till you've knocked 
something off  the wall

:)

i dont think holding the big wigs captive and making them listen 
to your tunes should be the way to get broken. the fact that you 
have to get "discovered" to get big instead of just putting out 
your own shit and having it blow up on a small indie label is a 
fucking farce.

its the mentality that is a bad thing, not the physical medium of

Can the proxy reach the outside? Do you have dns configure on the 
workstations? is this a client server or do you have both the web browser and 
squid running on the same machine. What are you trying todo.

what does this mean: "Make no restrictions regarding speech or the 
press."? i cant say i agree with that if it means not restricting 
the people who own the press from monopolizing all media in a 
specific city. thats a poorly worded question. 

here's me:

South-You are a Southerner-an egalitarian-which means that you 
advocate an increased role for the government in the economic 
realm. You are more or less pleased the government's role in the 
personal realm. 

i dont know if i agree with that actually, at least the part of 
being pleased with the govt's role in personal shit. im for some 
freedoms that are definitely not currently allowed, and i have 
some other qualms but whatever. the graph has me next to jesse 
jackson which i guess is close to correct.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dubplate Culture

did you ever think for a minuete that some ppl cant afford to setup a small 
indy label???  it costs about a grand to press 300 white labels....i dont 
have that money...the ppl with indy labels are usually more interested into 
pressing their own music if they are gonna drop that kind of money on a 
release...lets face facts...most indy labels put out one record and fold 
because of the state of the industry now...if i pressed 300 whites id be 
hard pressed to break even...and as much as music is art to me...if i put a 
grand up for a run of records i want to at least break even...cuz if i dont 
ill be even more of a starving artist...and have you seen me(im a big dude)? 
starving isnt high on my list of things i wanna do when i grow up(i already 
eat ramen on a daily basis cuz of my music habbit)

setting up your own label is definately a way in if you have the 
money....but theres nothing wrong with giving yourstuff to established 
producers or even playing it for them on the ride from the airport...its not 
like you pick up andy c from the airport and go all nuts like "this is me 
bleh bleh bleh" play it cool...have your cd in the player and if he likes 
it, he'll ask what it is....thats where i was going with my last post.


Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

here's me:
West-You are a Westerner-a civil libertarian-which means that you 
advocate a diminished role for the government in the personal 
realm. You are more or less pleased the government's role in the 
economic realm. 

I think it came up that way because i believe that persons should 
have the 'right' to fuck their own lives up without having laws to 
keep them from doing this.

bitch, you wanna be a prostitute? go ahead.

bitch, you wanna do lots of drugs? there's some crack in the oven.

although i dont agree that i'm happy with government in the 
economic realm... i'd like to see more distribution of wealth (i 
even wanted the graduated tax question, where the rich get taxed 
at a higher level) and also more of centralized major business.

NW-You would feel most at home in the Northwest region. You advocate a large degree of economic and personal freedom. Your neighbors include folks like Ayn Rand, Jesse Ventura, Milton Friedman, and Drew Carey, and may refer to themselves as "classical liberals," "libertarians," "market liberals," "old whigs," "objectivists," "propertarians," "agorists," or "anarcho-capitalist."

I'm NW: That's about right. I want the govt out of my life and
I'm closer to Jesse Ventura then Jesse Jackson. I'll Hitler
myself now though cuz I'm not trying to get into a poli-sci
discussion.

NW-You would feel most at home in the Northwest region. You advocate a
large degree of economic and personal freedom. Your neighbors include
folks like Ayn Rand, Jesse Ventura, Milton Friedman, and Drew Carey, and
may refer to themselves as "classical liberals," "libertarians," "market
liberals," "old whigs," "objectivists," "propertarians," "agorists," or
"anarcho-capitalist."

Peace,
Luke

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dubplate Culture

doa wasnt part of dnb massive

doa was orginally the bad company msgboard at bcrecordings.com

then fresh mentioned the new domain in an issue of knowledge(in the march01 
issue i believe) and the droves started signing up and generally ruining the 
general chat to the point where the real heads started hiding on the grid 
and other parts of doa the regular "boardies" dont know about

its funny as hell to me...cuz theres some ppl with 10,000+ posts that have 
never been to the secret forums(which really arent all that secret, u just 
have to have half a brain to figure out howto get to them)



Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

Now THAT was a fun party. I took my old man to that one for his
50th bday... had a killer afterparty at my house afterwards... And
i think the flyer for this party is just about my favorite flyer

Ahh... the good old days....

They didn't miss it, it just falls under "socialists" or "communists". Or people named tom cox.

Anyone who thinks the government exists to take care of them is the definition of an idiot.

re: revibe
 
that's one of my favorite flyers as well. 
E.R. always had quality lineups and cool venues. That party was only $10 w/ John Kelley, Huda Hudia, & Anabolic Frolic booked & no worry of anyone losing their ass on the show... not to mention that the venue was one of the best I've ever seen used for an event... I remember the old guys chillin in the hallway just watching everything going on, one of them was just fascinated with the blowup flyer of the EleMental party that was being promoted at the show. He was holding on to it and looking at the crowd, looking at the flyer, looking at the crowd.... lol

the government exists to protect me from cocksuckers who like free 
markets and guns and all that other nonsense that only does good 
for the few not the many. 

convincing people who have no power that they should agree with 
principles that hold them down is one of tyhe biggest coups of the 
right.

That's a great opinion you've got there.

Gun control causes a permanent raise in crime rates.

That's a great fact I've got here.  :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Swarm - Enter the Hive

If your going to buy one Drum and Bass CD all year, this is it! It's
finallly been released after being pushed back TWICE from its original
scheduled release in Novemeber or Decemeber? Regardless, many of these
tracks are still fresh.

For those that don't know, Swarm is 3 of Philly's hottest up and coming
producers, D'Star, Trust, and Myster Mason, and have been signed to
Metalheadz in UK. The FIRST Stateside producers to have accomplished such.
Cameo appearances on the CD by MC's Armanni Reign and Sharpness (aka Mental
Sharp when together).

Here's a CD sampler:
www.mystermason.com/wma/ethsampler.wax

And a video of what happens to those that get in Swarm's way (Jes, notice
Odi making a special appearance at 2:06):

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} 10k home studio

10k is a weird number. For 30 you can get into some serious gear, but 10, is
just too much and too little.

1. Dump as much as you can into your room. Soundproof the motherfucker, make
it comfortable, but make it a workspace. All real studios have a leather
couch, it's true. You can quote me on this.

2. Get a decent mixing desk. You can pick up an O2R for < $2000.

3. Serious monitors, some nice nearfields too.

4. $5k easy on your DAW of choice and a hefty box and sound interface for
it.

5. Condensers, Condensers, Condensers.

See, the thing is, there's isn't going to be a magical formula for spending
10k. I've dumped way more than that over the years on stuff, and it never
works out. You find yourself needing something or other. So my suggestion is
to just blow the cash on the mixing desk, large monitoring setup with
nearfields, and a computer, find out what else you need later.

- Mike

Subject: {pb-cle} ride to Cleveland

I'm thinking about going to the Sendex/$tikworx show at Abasso on Friday.  Is 
anyone going from Pittsburgh who would be willing to give me a ride?

Alternatively, I'm thinking about taking Greyhound out.  I've never been to 
Cleveland before.  I see that the Greyhound station and Abasso are pretty 
close to each other.  Are they in the kind of neighborhood where I can feel 
safe walking between Abasso and the Greyhound station during nightclub hours?

I know Trust - React was released, as well as a few more allready have been
released. Easily some of the greatest dnb producers around now. Pure
ingenuity and just one of the many reasons Philly is on THE dnb map.

For those that care, go to www.mystermason.com and in the mix section theres
like 5 whole live sets. One from february with Armanni and 2 shy.

Suweeeeeeeetness.

The UK doesn't have guns available to the public, obviously.  The UK 
also has a higher rate of violent crime than the US.

Concealed weapons made easily available to law abiding citizens reduce 
crime.

Oh, sorry; I'm arguing this from the libertarian side, not 
conservative/liberal.  My bad on that one.

what the fuck are you smoking man? $10,000 is more than the cost

he said "home" studio. this shit is unncessary at your house.

also not necessary. digital desks are so not needed. a nice allen

just get a pair of mackies or events for about $1000 or so, most 
people seem good to go with that.

steal your programs till you find the one you like. soundcards are 
mostly under $1000 for alot of inputs and outputs like the motu 
firewire joints. build your own computer with the specs you want. 
this shouldnt come anywhere near $5k.

and what is he going to do with those? unless you know something

its funny, the people i know personally with many records out have 
nothing even approaching this much money's worth of studio gear. 
if youre making dance music its not even necessary to have this 
much money spent. get a nice computer and soundcard (the m audio 
deltas are really good for really cheap. those motu joints are 
nice too but more money), decent monitors (like i said, mackie or 
events seem to be what most people use), an analogue mixing desk 
(even the mackie 8 bus joints are nice and cost just over a 
thousand for the 24 channel joints), and maybe a nice synth that 
you can record with and use its keyboard for midi control (the 
virus keyboards are pretty ill, as are the newer nord lead and the 
nord modular). you can honestly get all this for under $5k. 

and remember, if you had to ask this question youll probably need 
to learn all this stuff as well. its going to take time and energy 
to even figure out what you should be doing with all this shit 
once you get it.

The many suck. 

Isn't that what you think anyway?

Free markets flow from the freedom to do what you like with your own possessions and abilities. Why sould someone else should work to support you?

Freedom is just awful, isn't it.

Which is worse, convincing people that they should agree with principles that might hold them down, or with principles that *will* hold everyone down?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} 10k home studio

for ppl getting into the game...stay away from analouge desks, unless you 
absolutely have to have a hardware sampler or need to mix lotsa mics...at 
the 10k pricepoint you arent gonna be able to get an analouge desk with a 
noiseflower lower than a good soundcard...yeah the mackies and heath's are 
good desks...but you get a clearer sound just going from your outboard gear 
into a good soundcard.

the best bet is to get the mackie daw control or if you must have a full 
featured digital desk get something that you can control your daw with like 
the yamaha 01 or 02, or the tascam dm24

or if u wait a few months behringer is dropping an 8 channel motorized daw 
control for 3 bills(thats what im waiting for)

daw control is sick...i got to really work with it the first time monday 
nite and i was loving it...having a tactile transport makes working on music 
so much faster...especially if you are using a sequencer you dont know(like 
me using logic)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} 10k home studio

He said home studio. Not "setup to make dance music". There's a big 
difference there. I will be vague when provided vague questions. 
Generally speaking, if you're mic'ing drums, etc, etc, etc, you're 
going to need some microphones, and a decent mixing desk (yamaha, A&H, 
whatever) -- and also someplace with some sound isolation so you aren't 
hearing the furnace in the background.

A MOTU unit will run you anywhere between $750 and $1300, Digidesign 
will run you a shitload more, but that's all personal preference (I 
personally hate the shit). Toss in Cubase and the NI Kollection, some 
controllers, etc, and you'll have no problem reaching $5000. Let's not 
make this a debate about stealing software, because I know people are 
going to chime in about this shit.

Once again the vagueness pops in here, I've spent a lot of time 
recording non-dance music, and when you get to talking about recording 
lots of instruments, things pop up you probably wouldn't even imagine. 
Mic'ing drums is a bitch, fucking cable management is a nightmare, 
dealing with band members and people who are "creative" is a pain in 
the ass, etc etc. Home studio is different than "I want to make dance 
music".

it all depends actually. i think people are stupid, which is why i 
know they need to be protected. 

>Free markets flow from the freedom to do what you like with your 
own possessions and abilities. Why sould someone else should work 
to support you?

because without me they wouldnt have a market to sell on or 
someone to work for them. the market goes both ways, even though 
corporations try to make it some other way. i cant wait to see 
what happens in X number of years when the global job market has 
priced all labour much higher than it is now. what will they do 
then? automate everything to produce product for all the 
unemployed people who cant afford to buy their products? ha.

yeah the freedom to bamboozle people is one of my all time 
favorites. 

>Which is worse, convincing people that they should agree with 
principles that might hold them down, or with principles that 
*will* hold everyone down?

well considering how many people ARENT held down, the answer is 
obvious. its funny that you would argue this as the only advantage 
i can see a libertarian holding for you is that youd be able to 
buy drugs legally. in every other way youd be fucked over by 
corporations running more rampant than they are today.

libertarians are on the right, theyre conservative, despite 
whatever "free" shit they might have convinced you to believe in. 
they didnt just invent a new view of the world. its funny, youre 
another person who wouldnt benefit from most of their beliefs but 
they hook you with a few issues that are mostly irrelevant and 
then get you to agree with all the other issues that will mean 
nothing to you. its a classic tactic of the right.

this is somewhat true. i mic individual drums and other percussion 
as well as my hammond organ in my room where my loud ass computer 
and old analogue synths and hammond hum away all day long. shit 
sounds fine, i always have to rough it up so it sounds as shitty

i just suggested that you should use pirated shit until you figure 
out what you like best. if youre so clueless that you have to ask 
this list what you should buy, jumping into a few thousand dollars 
worth of software you might not like at all isnt a very smart 
idea. anyway, quick breakdown:
computer - $1000
soundcard - $1000
software - $1000

thats only $3k. i dont think you need $2k worth of controllers. if 
you buy a virus kb and one of those automated fader joints that 
might come to like $2k but also accomplishes many other tasks such 
as mixing and sound generation.

even still, micing shit isnt THAT bad really if youre doing shit 
yourself. im not micing a full drum set with individual mics, but 
i dont know how many people are really doing that in a home studio 
anyway. and as far as "creative" people, thats why i quit being in 
bands when i was 18 and started deejaying and working on buying 
electronic gear. fuck other people.

Fair enough.  Your version results in more crime, though.  If you want 
the numbers, I'd be glad to dig them out.

So would anyone.

However, when criminals know they might get shot while trying to go 
against you with brass knucks, the odds of them wanting to commit crime 
goes down.

Hold up.  Wait a minute.

I said 'libertarian', not 'Libertarian'.  I think the Libertarian party 
is full of crackpots, and I think that implementing their ideas 100% 
would make society at least as bad as it is now.

I just think a little more freedom for individuals is a great thing. 
Bind corporations, if you like; that's probably necessary to keep 
individuals free.

Like I said; I just like personal freedoms.

actually thats the thing, i dont get much room noise at all

that

the main noise sources in the organ are just the organ itself (it 
kind of whirrs a bit when its on) and the keys and pedals. i 
usually put my mic up close to the speaker (remember, i dont have 
a leslie for it yet, i just use the build in speaker which sounds 
amazingly dirty) and try not to pound on the keys too much. i was 
thinking it might be cool to make a little shelter to go around 
the small mic stand that would give it some natural reverb and 
block out a little more of the keys and pedals, but im a lazy guy. 

>you might wanna 
>clean the inside of that organ too...you'd be amazed how much

yeah i do need to do that for sure.

i use one of these:

http://www.audio-technica.com/prodpro/profiles/AT3031.html

my other mic is one of these:

http://www.audio-technica.com/prodpro/profiles/AT3035.html

i got them bitches pretty cheap.

as best i can tell im not getting much noise from equipment that 
shouldnt be producing it, no weird ground loops or anything. 

>theres a difference between sounding raw and sounding shitty to

hehehehe, i like them both : )

im just saying that even when i record my hammond in my noisey ass 
room, it still sounds so damn pristine that it needs some 
processing to be as ugly as i like my organ to sound.

if the trade off is more crime but the crime is less severe, i 
think thats a good thing.

i just dont know man. when both sides potentially have guns, 
nothing changes except people get shot and die more often. if both 
sides have no access to guns, youre in better shape.

okay, so why not just adopt the finer points of personal freedom 
into a philosophy that makes sense for everybody? for example, im 
a socialist and i would support things like making drugs and 
prostitution legal. i would then tax the shit out of them and use 
the cash to implement positive social programs. i think that 
somewhere along the line peoples perception of socialism got 
switched to mean "soviet russia" or china or cuba which isnt the 
reality of the philosophy. the swedes have a nicely socialized 
culture where people have plenty of personal freedom yet also get 
socialized health care and higher education.

Agreed; just not sure that's the case.

Dunno.  I'm not convinced on this one, since UK has more violent crime 
than we do.

Yeah; socialism got jacked by communism got jacked by Russia sucking at 
it.  There are good ideas in there.  However, as ya might notice, most 
of Europe is socialist to some extent or another, and so are we.

The biggest socialist item that's going to make it into American law 
soon is nationalized health care... and that, I truly fear.  :( 
Implementing it with our tax rates can't work, and would result in 
uber-shitty medical care.  The reason things like that work in Sweden is 
that they pay 80% or so in income taxes...

what is the definition of violent crime exactly? i mean honestly 
if people could settle things with physical violence without 
worrying so much about getting shot by a crazy motherfucker i 
think that would be a good thing as well.

well we arent nearly as good about it as most of europe is. and if 
you let the repubs have their way, theyd take out most if not all 
of the social programs. the libertarians would as well, which is 
another reason i dont like them. i just took some of their more 
useful ideas and incorporated them into my own.

i dont necessarily think we would have to tax at that rate. we 
have one of the richest countries including some of the richest 
people and corporations in the world. with proper progressive 
taxation we would make it the best in the world. with republicans 
cutting taxes on everybody but most especially the ultra rich, it 
wont happen properly.

Same here.  Libertarians don't seem to realize that changing the system 
has to take a long, long time, or things are gonna suck for everyone.

Socialized medicine just scares me; I don't like politicians making laws 
about things they don't understand.  Basically, if doctors told me 
'socialized medicine is good', I'd believe them.  (And yes, I know; 
asking doctors in it for the money ain't gonna yield great results, but 
I think there are a lot of doctors *not* in it for the money.)

three more things.

1.  browsed to gmail.com using opera 7.5b3.  what should come up?=20
(thanks to how i've set opera to handle cookies.)  "The server tried to=20
use cookies for exploitative purposes.  The server's hostname does not=20
match the domain attribute, and the cookie has been rejected."

Address http://www.gmail.com.

PREF=3DID=3D1312ef8db40f3e44:TM=3D1081373099:LM=3D1081373099:S=3DTfqGJfF8=
ooiohIAG;=20
expires=3DSun, 17-Jan-2038 19:14:07 GMT; path=3D/; domain=3D.google.com

(note:  i know that this is a fairly innocuous oversight on the part of=20
the designers, but still.)

2.  key quotes:
"While Google brags that no humans will read your emails, the entire=20
Gmail program will involve extensive automated profiling of you as an=20
individual. Google will be sharing the non-identifiable portions of your =

profile with anyone they choose. If the ownership of Google changes, or=20
there is a merger, the entire personally-identifiable profile will be=20
available to the new owners or partners.

Finally, it's all available to government officials all over the world,=20
under whatever legal procedures are used in any particular jurisdiction. =

It is also available to civil litigants under discovery procedures=20
authorized by a court. When you look at it this way, the one-gigabyte=20
allowance for your email account becomes much less attractive.

Google never deletes anything they collect, as far as we can tell. Think =

twice before typing in your email address on a Google form."

3.  while you're at it, click on the link at the top that says=20
"Twenty-eight organizations urge Google to suspend Gmail".

the simple solution to the problem:

don't accept the cookie.

google works fine without cookies enabled.

nobody ever said that the marketing/advertising would be *effective*.=20
but it would be targeted based on the information that google harvested=20
as a result of the cookie it put on your computer.

but unless you clear the browser's cookies before and after each and=20
every session, or at least before you used it or after someone else used =

it, every search on google is attributed to the same cookie ID.

this is very simple people
In IE (since that's what most people use)
Tools -> Internet Options -> "privacy" tab
click on the 'edit' button in the 'web sites' section
Where it asks for address type in google.com and hit block, then type in=20
gmail.com and hit block.

Opera can be set to just throught out every cookie when you close it.

=46irefox:
Tools -> options  -> privacy
click on the + next to the cookies section and click on exceptions.  Follow=
=20
the instructions above for adding google.com and gmail.com.

problem solved.

that's your prerogative guy, but if that's the case, do me 2 favours: 
when gmail is available to the general public, sign up immediately. 
you'll need the gig of disc space for all the spam you're gonna get....





....for all the advertising you're NOT interested in.

also, get a bigger mailbox for all the paper junk mail that's going to 
come your way....






....for all the advertising you're NOT interested in.

i like to be selective, i like to choose what corporations know about me 
and what advertising i get.  i understand that i don't get exactly what 
i want, but i don't want to give myself up to the corporate hacks and 
say "sell me something!!"

but, to each his own.

Your discrimination against corporation (the backbone of this country) is 
sickening.  Move to China, tinfoil-boy.

first off thank you both. the 1st program found almost 700 different files

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} spyware

well i might skim em first. back em up if you want.

usually worst case is whatever program you installed to get the spyware 
from wont work. the absolute worst case i haven't heard much about 
lately is that the winsock stack gets corrupted in older versions of 
adaware. but that i guess is fixed.
alot of what those programs find is fluff.....

solstice and the vernal equinox.
The Neptunalia, a festival in honour of Neptunus, the God of all the
fresh water, from rivers, lakes, oceans and springs.
The Neptunalia, July 23, comes in the hottest days of Summer, when
water is needed most.
The Day out of Time is celebrated annually on  July 25.  It has been
celebrated internationally since 1993
as a day of Peace Through Culture.  The main focus of this day is
tuning in to the true timeless essence of life.

At the age of 21, he releases his debut solo album - "A MACHINE'S
DREAM" . His music is futuristic and

it's such an ignorant thing to turn a security, privacy and personal 
freedom (which i would assume that you believe in, what with the big 
"vote libertarian" in your sig) discussion into a right vs. left 
mudfight.  i would truly LOVE to see someone make an intelligent 
argument that keeping personal information private is a right vs. left 
issue.

> You have a reading comprehension problem, Liberal.

who said i was a liberal?  i'm a registered independent with libertarian 
leanings.


> I'll do that.

your mailman will appreciate that.  oh, but why care about him because 
he's in a union and poor?

> You have a reading comprehension problem, Liberal.

who said i was a liberal?  just because i disagree with you and question 
the motives of corporations?  please.  i subscribe to the economist AND 
AND the weekly standard AND the nation AND the national review.  what 
does that make me?

oh right.  willing to hear and entertain BOTH sides of the argument and 
STILL decide for myself.

> Your discrimination against corporation (the backbone of this country)

excuse you but the backbone of this country is the individual.  just 
because i criticise corporation DOES NOT mean that i'm anti-corporation. 
   just because i don't want corporation to know everything about me 
doesn't make me anti-corporation.  it means i want to protect myself. 
it means i QUESTION corporation, hell, i question everything.  and THAT 
is what democracy and, oh yes, this country is all about.

also seeing the ann coulter quote in your sig, i understand where you 
get some of your ideas and arguments from if ann "i couldn't make an 
intelligent argument even if i was ugly" coulter is what you have to 
look up to as a role model.  we did wander off quite a bit from the 
original topic of data mining, data retention, and personal privacy.

at least i don't have to resort to name calling to make a point.

enough.  if you have something intelligent and topic related (cookies, 
security, privacy) to say to me, please reply privately.  a public forum 
isn't the place for a personal flame war.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} spyware

sometimes ad-aware and other anti-spyware programs dont work if your browser 
has been hijacked. you may want to go to a forum dedicated to computer 
problems download "hijack this" have someone read your logfile and tell you 
what to get rid of, even if it is working fine now. what is the name of the 
website it goes to?

Subject: {pb-cle} Turntable Question

Someone was telling me last night that they want to get a digital Technics
turntable. I asked if they meant the one that plays cds and he said it
wasn't. He told me it is a turntable that plays standard vinyl, with a
built in D/A converter that has optical digital outs. I couldn't find it
on their site...is there such a beast?

When looking for that turntable I was comparing the SL1200MK2 and the
SL1200MK5. I could not find any difference in the specs, other than that
the MK5 had a $150 lower msrp, and no dust cover. What's the big
difference?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Good bands comming to beachland

Southern Culture on the Skids is BOMB. If you get a chance I highly
recommend them. When I saw them there were all these hot girls dressed as
hillbilly chicks. Not plants or anything, just audience members. Towards
the end of the show, the band picked about 8 to come on stage. While the
band played, each of these girls were given a huge bucket of chicken. They
would take maybe two or three bites from each piece and then throw that
shit into the audience. Classic.

Nothing like some greasy hillbilly chicks.

Just a technical question.  I have an Essential Mix that's 119:34 mins =
long.  I have Nero 6 or can get just about anything else.  How do I burn =
this mix to a disc?  I understand that I may have to cut it down to less =
than 80 mins.  How do I do this?

Thanks,
Donnie

I know Denon used to make decks that had spdif outs. I think at one point they even had one that did
"master tempo" pitching...No idea if they still do make them...

Apparently, Numark makes some as well.

I haven't heard anything about Technics marketing a "digital out" deck...

1a) Open the mp3 up in Cool Edit/Sound Forge/somethign else that allows you to open MP3's up as a
waveform.

--OR--

1b) Use winamp to write the MP3 as a WAV file.


2) Find a sensible point toward the middle to make a cut in the continuous file...you can even fade
out at teh end of disc 1, fade in to disc 2, etc. and save the independent halves.

3) Some programs allow you to write a CUE sheet that would set track-breaks throughout the hour-plus
long wave file...this is way handy when compared to having one big hour-plus-long "Track 1" on the
CD.

I recommend  CD Wave (www.cdwave.com) for writing the cue sheet files. It's small, it's easy, and
best, it's free!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr>>google's horns grow

brings out a fresh roll of reynolds for everyone who is worried about a FREE 
service.

For those who aren't terrified of conspiracy (like me), this fuss will be 
over in a few weeks or shortly after GMail is released.  Is it something to 
be concerned about - maybe on the back burner - not sure what I intend to 
argue with this email but here goes:

Put this into perspective, what if Microsoft didn't announce Hotmail until 
this year?  Would there be a similar reaction?  Probably.  "What they 
already own 90% of the OpSys & Home Office Market, now they want us to use 
their email?"

You think that Yahoo and Hotmail don't already do the same or aren't envious 
to do so?  They could easily use key words in your email to trigger ads.  
Why not? They do it to weed out spam.  I hear no one complaining there.  
They might already be doing it, but I haven't noticed, I hardly get any ads 
anymore.

"you'll need the gig of disc space for all the spam you're gonna get"

You get spam because of you're own stupidity in sharing your email address.  
You may get a few occasionally by force emailing (aaaaaaa@hotmail, 
aaaaaab@hotmail, etc).  I've had this hotmail account for 5 years, do I get 
spam?  yes, but maybe 3 or 4 a week - most caught by the spam filter (and 
how does that work? by filtering based on keywords!) - my personal account 
about the same - though no filter.  I'm just anal retentive about this.  So 
just incase, I have one set aside for signing up with questionable sites 
those of which I don't even use my name or info.

On to the archiving of emails:
Do you think Yahoo or Hotmail or AOL permanently delete your old email?

Ha.

If you want to complain about privacy, complain about the asshats that 
cunningly install spy & adware on your computer and track everything you do, 
not just on the web but on your computer too! *gasp*shock*.  Uninstall AIM 
and Yahoo and go with Trillian because they install programs (WildTangent) 
that can track you and they blatantly report back to a central server 
(Atleast AIM does, no reason yahoo can't or doesn't - remember Yahoo has 
offline messages - as does ICQ, those are stored somewhere).

Google is doing the same thing Yahoo and Hotmail (MSN) did years ago, only 
they're getting more exposure because

1. They're Google - the dominant search engine by use and by brand. How many 
of you have said "I'll google it"?

2. They'll probably do it better, because:

3. Their technology far surpasses anything Yahoo, MSN, other competitors 
have yet to do.

4. The privacy buffs are tired of going after Ashcroft and Bush and 
Carnivore & the FBI and NSA; they crave fresh meat.

Server logs and a few lines of script could track you through their site 
just as easily.  Although, yes, they won't have your name or address or 
whatever information you might give them. But if they really had to find out 
who you were, there's a big enough electronic trail to goto your ISP if the 
reason and FBI warranted. Cookies just make it easier and if you want some 
sort of interactive experience, there are few ways of circumventing them 
with web applications and they're expensive and certainly not going to be 
used in a free service. Hotmail users notice that everything with hotmail is 
done through msn.com, not hotmail, so that cookies can easily be transfered 
to the rest of MSN's sites (ESPN, etc)

So why is Google giving out a gig of space per user?  Simple, they need the 
large data amounts to test their algorithms.  And it's not just not fun to 
search 2 or 3 megs per person.  They're looking for heavy data search and 
retreival similar to their web search with probable hopes of improving both 
or taking their technology to the next level.  If you're worried about ads, 
Yahoo could do this if they wanted, but for whatever reason, they haven't or 
if they are, I haven't noticed.  With a pretty large hosts file blocking 
most advertisers, I hardly get any ads anymore.

It comes down to this: If you don't like the policy, don't use it (it's 
probably been said).  Don't email anyone you know that has a GMail address 
or relays their address to it.  Will I use it?  Hell, why not? I can keep 
mailing lists that much longer on my account and read at my leisure before 
my space fills up and I have to delete and go search the archives to find 
something that happened last summer.  Will I use it for personal email?  
Probably not, but it's nice in a pinch if my host is being a bitch and I 
can't access my email for one reason or another.

my stanton decks have digital out too (str8-60)

never used it tho(dont have any spdif ins)

i always thought about multitracking my dj mixes...runing each deck to a 
seperate stereo track....and the mixer to a 3rd track...that way if all the 
records were locked...but some of the actual mixing was spotty i could 
digitally re-mix in cubase

Interesting, my parents laptop just got some program that kept trying 
to set the homepage to some search site.  ad aware and spybot didn't 
find it, nothing fishy in the registry, ended up just doing a system 
restore a few days back and it seems to fix it.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} spyware

http://www.pchell.com/pestscan

is a decent one kinda like hijack this, only it gives instructions on how to 
remove stuff.

If you buy it, i think it removes it for you but the free one still has a 
wealth of knowledge

but the trojan.bookmarker.gen specifically wasn't in there.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Turntable Question

There was recently a thread on em411.com about this, some guy with a four
track did the deck outputs on channels one and two of his four track
(remember, it's mono), and two mic's on the crowd. It wouldn't be a half bad
idea to do it Nick's way and have one mic on the crowd too. Good ideas
abound.

Well, I don't know about "ANYONE".

The LAST thing we need in this country is the "William Hung" phenomenon going into politics...

Then again, there are those that would argue that the 2000 election and current administration is a
result of that very thing...


<little off topic.>>

1) Given enough time, politicians would find a way to abuse it and bend it to support their specific
agendas. That's just human nature, I think. Given enough time, anyone will figure out how to massage
a societal system to his/her benefit.

2) HA! Off Topic? Here? Pashaw....

studio, what should i buy?


good idea to try a few apps first before you buy.  but I would check out 
CubaseSX
if you looking for alot of easy to use soft synths.  CubaseSX is a very easy, 
user friendly app to work in.  Think I have a disk full of stuff floating 
round here some where...  wink wink...

yea the MAudio Delta series are good check the 1010LT (PCI card only) is nice 
with
10 in & outs.  You can get em cheap through FullCompass.com & NovaMusik.com 
is nice. 

the Mackies are nice monitors but Tannoy makes the Reveal, a good cheap near 
field.

the Alesis RA150 is a nice amp but wont shake your neighbors out of bed.  
which can be good>?

of coarse you can do all your mixing through CubaseSX or whatever app your 
using
but it is definitely better IMO to have an external mixer.  Go for the 16ch or
 you will be sorry.  Mackies are nice , and they are just releasing their new 
line, which are incredible looking.  but if your pickie,  pick up a 
Soundcraft FX16, must mailorder it but worth the wait.  not motorized but under 1200$   
=]

synth wise the recommendation to pick up a Nord or Access Virus is definitely 
a wise one.
I have fiddled with many soft synths and recently picked up a Virus Indigo  
and it is the most incredible piece I own up against a Korg Prophecy, SH101, 
Sequential...
it is so smoooth, like butter.  I kiss it at night before bedtime<< trust me.
they also store 1024 patches and multi patches.  and MANY freebies 
downloadable on da net. 3k+ patches , very nice.
another recommendation would be the Alesis Andromeda, Novation SuperNova or a 
Moog.  All are well worth the green  $$$
If your seriously looking for a hardsynth pick one with multi-outs (2 stereo 
(4))
to plug into that new 16 ch mixer of yours.
you will need no other synths if you go this way, due to the 
Multitimbral/MultiPatch.

sampler wise, of coarse you can do all "sampling" within most of your apps, 
but to get the real feel I prefer a hardware sampler.  pain in the neck to use 
but just "feels better to have a real one".  You can pick these up from music 
shops and ebay for cheap.  EMU has stopped producing them (usually used for 
live rigs) and who can blame them.  they have just released their EmulatorX 
series of PCI host card samplers, which look impressive.   Im thinking about 
picking one up just for shits an giggles.

of coarse you can do all sorts of drum work in Reason & Cubase etc...
but I would recommend the Alesis DM Pro or the Novation Drumstation.
Incredible pieces!

good luck

peace

Jon

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Entropy - The Punk & Metal Rave mix

Blurring the lines between Rave and Rock, I give you a new mix.  All tunes 
are Rave tunes that have sampled or covered a punk or metal song, from nu 
skool breakbeat to psy-trance to dnb to gabber and from grunge to punk to 
speed metal to classic punk to classic metal.

Some of you will love this.  And some of you will hate this.  But isn't 
that always the case?  ;)

Enjoy!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Turntable Question

Yeah, but you can still wreck traktor pretty hard. 2.5 is where it's at now,
but wuth the 1.x series, you couldn't fuck up if you tried.

Traktor can't tell a down from an upbeat, and when the two meet wrong, it's
fugly.

On that note, has anyone seen Richard Devine's traktor setup, or heard any
of his traktor mixes? Fucking ILL.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Live 4 track recording (WAS: Turntable Question) 

If anyone has the Breakbeat Militia Live at OZ cd...that's pretty much =
how I
recorded it...except for the individual TTs.

I had the aux out from the main mixer (we had 3 mixers and 5 decks) and =
hung
3 different mics around the stage.

I brought in my good 'ol VS-880 digital multi track recorder and put the
mixer on channels 1 and 2...and each mic on it's own channel. Later on, =
I
just mixed it down onto the CD. (turned up the crowd at breakdowns, etc =

I think it ended up VERY well.

Subject: {pb-cle} This List

This list is becomming (or has been and I wasn't paying attention) a flame 
ground for tom and who ever is disaggreeing with him at the moment. 

This entropy thread was compeltely pointless argument that did nothing but 
waste my time having to read it. How is this even closely related to raves. 
Not that I don't venture off topic but this was nothing more then 3 people 
calling each other names.  Honestly did any of that matter. Even one fucking 
bit. So tom doesn't like the mix or track selection and all of a sudden where 
ripping on dead people. 

Grow Up. 
This is getting fucking stupid.

Paul..just do what I do. Delete all emails from
selected individuals who have proven over time
that all they are here to do is argue about
off topic shit. I used to just follow up on the
archives but I don't think they exist anymore.
Which is ok. Like you said..off topic is going
to happen sometimes, but you can definitely make
a list of those who abuse it on a regular basis.
It is a shame too, because there used to be alot
of cool people on this list that aren't here anymore
because of all the bullshit. Arguing is pointless,
because everybody is wrong. Name calling just creates
bad energy and really shows a person immaturity and
lack of ability to carry on an intelligent conversation.
There are still a few people I like to read emails
from on this list and I stay on here, because I don't
want all of Trout's hard work to be for nothing.

This list is becomming (or has been and I wasn't paying attention) a flame

This entropy thread was compeltely pointless argument that did nothing but 
waste my time having to read it. How is this even closely related to raves. 
Not that I don't venture off topic but this was nothing more then 3 people 
calling each other names.  Honestly did any of that matter. Even one fucking

ripping on dead people. 

Grow Up.

OK, y'all are going to laugh at this one...

I used to have a club/dance/rave remix of The Doors' Roadhouse Blues.

I can't find it anywhere.

Does anyone 'round here happen to have a copy they'd shar with their old pal [mark]??

I don't really understand what is so bad about arguing.

Why does all of this impact your lives so much?

This list is becomming (or has been and I wasn't paying attention) a flame 
ground for tom and who ever is disaggreeing with him at the moment. 

This entropy thread was compeltely pointless argument that did nothing but 
waste my time having to read it. How is this even closely related to raves. 
Not that I don't venture off topic but this was nothing more then 3 people 
calling each other names. Honestly did any of that matter. Even one fucking 
bit. So tom doesn't like the mix or track selection and all of a sudden where 
ripping on dead people. 

Grow Up. 
This is getting fucking stupid.

im saying...if you route all the outs of the delta into the ins of the 
mackie...then mix on the mackie and send the buses back on the delta it 
could be noisy

stuff that is all done digital should stay digital unless its going thru 
tubes or a tape deck


i remeber...about maybe a year and a half ago...i was wanting to do 
this...you all told me not to for that very reason..i did anyways...and the

if u must have faders to produce shit...the way to go is definatley daw

i mean it would seem like you should have a reason to route the 
things out to hardware. just doing it for shits and giggles doesnt 
make much sense. if youve got a nice compressor or efx box or 
whatever that you wanna use, i dont think that using a delta and a 
mackie adds all that much noise. when i multitrack, i usually 
record to logic clean, then run it back into the board with efx 
and EQ from my mackie. it is still usually the cleanest sounding 
thing coming in, possibly due to my old ass analogue gear. 

but anyway, if you have no hardware that would necessitate running 
your tracks out to a mixer, theres really no point.

If  anyone has or does leave this list because of Tom's silly ranting then they are just as much of a jackass as he is.  Don't get me wrong Im not some huge Tom fan, but on ocassion even Tom has something funny or interesting to say.  But people have been bitching a lot lately.
 
my 2 cents
Peace

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} the death of a laptop:

Here's what I run on mine here at work, which I have to keep from people that 
know what packet sniffers are and all that other lovely hacking stuff.

Linux side (99.9% what I use @ work):
no antivirus
I JUST installed iptables for firewalling just for the heck of it
main web browser is firefox, which does a good job at filtering popups and all 
the other bad stuff.
I then just make sure everything possible that I do is encrypted, even this 
email client I'm using supports encryption.

Windows XP side (mainly use at home, so not as security concious):
norton anti virus, although may go to AVG free, pretty decent for the price 
(free)
No firewall, I just use the network firewall that is there
Again web browser is firefox
and still do encryption as much as possible (although I don't for LAN traffic 
since I figured it would be more efficient

---

Work computer (just got a new one a couple days ago :) )
Windows 2000:
AVG anti virus
Sygate personal firewall (looks better than zonealarm IMO)
Main browser here is quick browser.  It's still IE based, but can do tabbed 
windows (nice since our new system is web based)  I also have firebird and 
opera on here as well :)


The two main things and micro$oft HAVE to have is a firewall somewhere along 
the line (either a network wide or local computer or even both) and 
anti-virus that can scan email, since that's the main culprit for spreading 
viruses.  I would also stay away from outlook express, besides being micro
$oft, a lot of viruses are made to soley exploit OE (sending to everyone in 
your address book, etc).  I use pegasus at home, I think TRAAAT likes 
mozilla's email, there's also a standalone mozilla one that's thunderbird.  
And then on the linux computer here I use KMail (the default one that comes 
with kde desktop)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} This List

Damn..I gotta un Hitler myself for a minute.

Please don't make the mistake of singling out
one individual as the main cause for the downfall
of this list. Don't give one person that much
credit. If you have ever taken part in a flame
war(s)that result in name calling and belittling
another person, then take a look at yourself first.
So, you can either continue to do that and show your
tru colors or you could help make this list a
place for good conversation and information again.
That's on you. The bottom line is respect, you
either have it or you don't. Don't tell me respect
has to be earned either. Respect starts with
you. If you have something negative to say to someone,
then maybe talking to them face to face might be
a quicker and more defining resolution. I guarantee
that half the shit that has been talked on this
list would never come to light if that was the case.


Love Boms,
Luke

I have no problems with it .   im just runnin the stereo out (delta) into the

kind of a waste with all those outs on the delta eh>?  really just use it 
hear the stereo mix out of Cubase and to dump/sample into the hardware for like a 
looped beat or a Reactor riff or sumthin...

guess its how you have em hooked up/looped.  those system loops can kill you 
ears and gear!

what do u guys recomend?  im setting up a linux box as soon as i choose a
distro.

i used to use redhat when i was in the industry...but i remember trout
telling me that redhat went enterprise only...im looking for something
similar to redhat and fairly easy to use...i wanna setup an ftp as a hub
between studios that i work at(think poor mans rocket network)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} DJ Entropy - The Punk & Metal Rave mix

there are 2 schools of thought on the "hit reply to all" when it comes 
to mailing lists.

some lists setup the "reply-to:" header to be the list, so just hitting 
reply will send it to the list.  thus ALL replies go to the list, even 
ones intended to be private, unless the sender corrects the "To:" line 
first.

the other is to not set the "reply-to:" header to the list, so you 
either hit reply to all and get some extra "to:" or "cc:" headers in 
there and edit them down or just be impolite and send it to all.

either way is less than ideal, pbcle is the second. mostly because thats 
the way it was setup and i never really saw a need to change it.
i do however have a "mail filter" setup to stop msgs with more than a 
few addresses in the headers to bounce.  used to prevent major 
crossposts and spam.  now more just crossposts.  so hitting reply to all 
can cause your mail to bounce.  you should get a little bit of an 
explaination in the mail i'm pretty sure....

i use AVG on my desktop.  it has a few quirks that are semi-annoying but 
no showstoppers. though doesn't panda have a freebie one too for 
non-commercial use?

my laptop i don't even have A/V because i'm the only one who uses it and 
don't have much on here. if it gets one i can prolly remove it.  its 
just not worth the CPU cycles on this poor old P2 laptop.

redhat released redhat 9 to the community.  it is now called fedora core 
1 (fedora.redhat.com)

i use it on my servers and it is basically a renamed redhat, a few 
glitches with the PGP keys and the setup of up2date and all that, but 
otherwise works fine.  probably have this all worked out when core 2 
comes out...  also now supports apt-get and yum repositories. i haven't 
looked into those yet.

Apt is the shit. Period takes all the bullshit out of package management.

also check out this distro http://taolinux.org/
its redhat enterprise but built from source so that it can be freely 
distributied. Fedora is missing things that redhat enterprise has.

its called setting your max bid for what you would really consider 
paying for it. it makes no sense to do anything else. if you 
wouldnt pay a penny over $150, set your bid for $150 and ebay does 
all the work for you. its very very simple.

i'm a big fan of fedora core... it's a really nice distro, and 
REALLY easy to find help if you're having problems with something. 
keeping patched is a snap, and firewalling is super easy too.

plus if you add livna repository support, getting multimedia stuff 
working is pretty easy too....

i use it at work, and it's been rock solid...

Exactly, sniping is the only way to assure that the seller isnt having a
friend 'bid it up a little bit'... Then you use the sniping software with
your max bet.  I'm sure if you did enough ebaying that it would easily save
you lots of money.

Subject: {pb-cle} Tom MF Cox was RE: {pb-cle} This List

I would say that Tom still brings to the list a vast knowledge of the
history of music, as well as the roots of where shit came from.  As long as
you know what you are talking about, he doesn't have anything that he
bitches about.  As long as you make a solid point and stay somewhat on
topic, usually he will either agree or not comment at all.  If you notice
the battles he picks are when someone is either dead wrong in their facts,
or tosses out an OPINION without much backup information or having the idea
being well thought out.  If more politics were kept off the list, you
wouldn't hear much from him.  At the same time I see a good need for them to
be discussed as it is a presidential election year and this list is about
what, 500 people traat?  It's another source of information for us as the
younger generation of voters.  I actually agree very much with what Tom has
to say about politics, it's not like he hasn't done his homework... I mean,
Entropy just says 'yay libertarians, yippee skippee'... Tom actually states
why he feels the way he does about different politicians and the parties
they are supposedly representing.

As for him pissing people off, he's a competitor, THINKS he's an alpha male,
so therefore whenever he sees anything he can attack on someone, he does,
it's his only way to feel better about himself.  As for the recipients of
the comments, you need to not let it get under your skin... "Fuck Tom Cox"
wasn't just a clever phrase on a wall, it's a mindset to have in your mind
after having an argument with him.  He says something that pisses you off?
Fuck Tom Cox, your idea is just as good if not better, just he made you feel
like you were wrong.  Occasionally you may be unprepared, but laws of
equality tell us that he is no better or no worse than any of us.

Smile and nod, bitches.

1. I would purchase lots of books and read.
2. I would join analog heavens mailing list.
3. I would purchase a "smart" first synth.  I think the Alesis Ion would be
good for this.
4. I would read some more.
5. I would purchase a midi interface for my computer. A 2in 2 out would be
fine.
6. I would try different sequencer software.
7. I would read about sequencer software.
8. I would read about computers and how to build them.
9. I would subscribe to sos online (sospubs.co.uk)
10.I would test different vsti programs and work with virtual synths until I
formed a basis of fetish that would drive me to make purchases in specific
fields to further the vision I would have after use.

I think tom would have a lot to offer and I don't question his love but his
way of transmitting things has put him in my autodelete list (the only one
in my auto delete list as a matter of fact).  It's to bad that his
personality is so twisted (not that mine isn't ;p).

[0]metoikos writes "Forget about hacking your Gameboy -- what about cat
toys or Teddy Ruxpins? Any of these is fair game to a circuit bending
hobbyist. Essentially, circuit bending is the art of making interesting
noises come out of re-engineered consumer electronics, mostly toys.
Bending recently came into the spotlight when a number of news
organizations discovered the [1]2004 Bent Festival at New York's Tank.
Derek Sajbel, a bender from California, is [2]writing a book/doing a
documentary on it." [3]BishopBerkeley writes "Circuit bending has
apparently been going on long enough among a large enough contingent of
benders to merit a weeklong festival dedicated to bending circuits. The
art is largely a process of making musical instruments by 'bending' the
circuits of fairly common electronic instruments and gadgets. According
to [4]this article in the New York Times people have been making rather
interesting music by modifying the strange toys with which a lot of us
grew up. If you're near Manhattan, and you didn't know about [5]the Bent
Festival, then think about going. You can find more info at [6]the
official circuit bending web site."

Subject: {pb-cle} thanks to all pb-cle list members

never really got to post my thank you e-mail since our
monday night weekly @ zythos ended towards the end of
last month. was in severe pain passing a kidney stone,
so obviously posting e-mails to the list was not top of
my agenda.

though now that the kidney stone is out of my system
and our weekly Revolve is over i just wanted to thank
all you fukkers for coming out & supporting us over the
past 3 yrs.

won't bother listing & thanking everybody individually
who came out, but thanks again to the following people
who came out to....

~ enjoy the various sounds
~ have a drink
~ use the upstairs bathroom (for reasons we all know,
but probably shouldn't mention)
~ spin records/perform live
~ have a good time

not sure what will be happening with monday nights @
zythos in the future. though i do wish the new promoter
& dj's good luck. only bit of advice i can dish out to
whoever will be taking charge is have a good time &
play some good shit that'll make people enjoy sitting
up there in a smoke cloud.

i'd be interested in reading what people have to say
about our monday nights now that we're no longer
hosting the night. though if the response to this
e-mail is anything like the turnout we had these past 6
months then i'm not expecting to get much feedback. 

thanks again to those who deserve the thanks....

kerem

For once noone was clipping the mixers. Lighting was also dope, with some
new intelligent moving heads added. Easily the best installed intelligent
lighting rig in the state. Shame really, if noone is gonna go to see them.

Subject: {pb-cle} Beat Matrix 04.12.2004 | wruw fm 91.1 | 10:30 pm - Special  Telethon Edition!

Hey Gang,
  
This week will be the special telethon edition of the Beat Matrix.  This is
the one time this year that Jassen and I will be asking you (the listeners)
to support the show, the station, and community radio.

WRUW, (91.1 FM) is a community driven, volunteer based, non profit radio
station that has been broadcasting in a non-commercial format for over two
decades.  The radio station is a medium that lets people broadcast and hear
music that you normally cannot hear on the commercial radio frequencies.
The Beat Matrix would not be possible if WRUW did not exist.  For the past
year and a half, WRUW made it possible for the sounds of the electronic
music scene in Cleveland to be heard by the massive.  Tonight is the night
that we ask you to show your appreciation for that.

The Telethon is the only time of the year that the station generates
revenue and it bases its budget off of its telethon earnings.  The staff at
WRUW works continuously to improve the quality of programming at the
station, but that cannot be possible without donations from the community.
Previous telethons have made is possible for the station to upgrade its
broadcast capacity to 15,000 watts.  Last year's telethon earnings allowed
the station to upgrade to a digital studio-to-transmitter link, meaning our
DJs live mixes are sounding better than ever!  This year the staff at the
station looks to improve our signal quality further by upgrading our dated
studio board, and researching a back up transmitter.  This cannot be done
without your support!

To show our thanks for your donations, WRUW has many premiums for certain
donation levels.  $100 donation will reward you with air-time (be a Beat
Matrix host for a day!), and a $30 dollar donation will score you a CD.
There are many more premiums, tune in tonight to hear them all!

Just how much is commercial free radio and the Beat Matrix worth to you?  If
you purchase a mix CD every week in the store, it would cost you around $900
dollars per year.  WRUW-FM and the Beat Matrix provide you with a new mix
tape every week for free!  Do you like to go out to hear live DJs? Listening
to the Beat Matrix can save you up to $300 dollars per year in club cover
charges.  If WRUW-FM were a juke box that costs 25 cents per day, then it
would only coast $91 dollars a year.  

In short, the Beat Matrix Crew asks you to show your appreciation and
support for WRUW FM because it has supported the electronic music scene and
non-commercial radio. By donating, you can help us bring the music to the
masses!  Please be sure to tune in tonight from 10:30p-12:30 and call in
with your pledges.  

The Beat Matrix Crew thanks you and hopes to hear from you tonight.

Subject: {pb-cle} Revolve RIP...(was 'thanks to all pb-cle list members')

I would like to publicly thank Mr. Kerem, Mr. Disco Dan and the MIA Kaleo for their support and for
running a heck of a night at yonder Memphis for three years.

I regret that my schedule has kept me away from going out Monday nights and supporting them for the
last year, and I really REALLY regret missing the final Revolve. It was the first weekly I
frequented after relocating to the 412, and the warm atmosphere and cold beers were always a good
way to chuck off the harshness of the 'first day of the week' blues.

I only hope that whoever moves into your spot can continue the welcoming atmosphere and good spirits
that became synonymous with Mondays "upstairs at Zythos".

Subject: {pb-cle} thanks to all pb-cle list members


never really got to post my thank you e-mail since our
monday night weekly @ zythos ended towards the end of
last month. was in severe pain passing a kidney stone,
so obviously posting e-mails to the list was not top of
my agenda.

though now that the kidney stone is out of my system
and our weekly Revolve is over i just wanted to thank
all you fukkers for coming out & supporting us over the
past 3 yrs.

won't bother listing & thanking everybody individually
who came out, but thanks again to the following people
who came out to....

~ enjoy the various sounds
~ have a drink
~ use the upstairs bathroom (for reasons we all know,
but probably shouldn't mention)
~ spin records/perform live
~ have a good time

not sure what will be happening with monday nights @
zythos in the future. though i do wish the new promoter
& dj's good luck. only bit of advice i can dish out to
whoever will be taking charge is have a good time &
play some good shit that'll make people enjoy sitting
up there in a smoke cloud.

i'd be interested in reading what people have to say
about our monday nights now that we're no longer
hosting the night. though if the response to this
e-mail is anything like the turnout we had these past 6
months then i'm not expecting to get much feedback.

thanks again to those who deserve the thanks....

kerem

If someone does take over that night, i'd hope they did turn that 
shit non-smoking (or any of the other nights :: 'cracker techno 
wednesdays').  even as a smoker, that's a main reason i dont go 
there much at all.  make people go downstairs and smoke around the 
hipsters.  the shit works at the shadow lounge to make people 
smoke outside... the memphis lounge just doesnt have nearly 
adequate ventilation if any at all...

If someone does take over that night, i'd hope they did turn that
shit non-smoking (or any of the other nights :: 'cracker techno
wednesdays').  even as a smoker, that's a main reason i dont go
there much at all.  make people go downstairs and smoke around the
hipsters.  the shit works at the shadow lounge to make people
smoke outside... the memphis lounge just doesnt have nearly
adequate ventilation if any at all...

underwear typically goes to forensics for lab tests in a rape
case for semen samples.

are you claiming rape?...if there is no incriminating semen
sample on the underwear (and it has to be the semen of the 
accused rapist) then you can be counter-sued for defamation 
of character and slander.

or did someone heist your underwear out of love?

when you are sleeping, so you wake up with part of your leg or arm missing
because it has been gnawing on it all night long.

If you are walking around and you bump something that is casting a shadow
over it, and the sun makes contact with it, you better run. It will
instantly run for your shadow, and scream the whole time it is chasing
you.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} last night

Maybe lack of promoting would be a good reason. I have yet to see a
flyer for the Metropolis's Spundae weekly. Saturday is Mark Farina and I
wouldn't even have known he was going to be here if I wasn't told by a
competing promoter.

metropolis sucked ass
i mean what is the point of even
opening that place up so that
25 people can hang out there

who the hell promoted this
nonsense.

on another note, big props
to the sound/lights crew, dnb
sounds great on that system.

touch was pretty lively, and the
dj was doing a great job

I had sooooo much fun Saturday. The vibe was the best I have felt at
Touch in quite some time. Thanks Doug for a great night of house music!

The guy hootin' in the back bothered me at first but after a while I
realized that he was just dancing his ass off and having a good time.
I'm just glad he was in the back :)

Subject: {pb-cle} Bunker records thing friday

Here's the pics I took from.  Didn't have time to caption most of 
them or making any effort to figure out who they are.  Also was going 
to wait till I got th vid I did on there, but that may be a few days.

direct link:
http://parties.vrillusions.com/gallery/bunker_sendextour

or main page:
http://parties.vrillusions.com/

Here's a quicky review:
Music was good, not many people (not surprising given latest 
happenings there), and new management sucks (constantly bugging the 
closing dj when he's going to end it, ended up stopping at 2:15, when 
the flyer said 2:30, etc)  Wish that Lectro monthly the best, but 
doubt I'll go back unless there's something I really want to see, 
like last friday.

Saturday, April 17 


Moda Nightclub
Event presented by Mythodic   


Deviant and Darbe of last year's ::TRUE:: Fridays fame are reunited at
the decks once again. 


DJ veteran Darbe opens the evening with some funky, ass-shakin' house
and breaks to get you started. 


Then Deviant finishes the night with a mental and physical journey
through deep progressive house. 


Also, don't miss out on snagging a free promotional copy of Deviant's
latest promotional mix CD, "Forgetting There." They're limited, so get
there early. 


For two-for-one admission, free drinks, and advance notice the HeadRush
Music Summer Series 2004 (DJs will be announced by Newsletter -- don't
miss your chance to buy tickets), visit our web site and sign up for the
e-mail newsletter. Once you sign up, drink and admission coupons will be
e-mailed later in the week. 


All event details, newsletter signup, and promo CD tracklist, are here:

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Bunker records thing friday

Yeah.  The owner/manager whatever he was, was being a
complete idiot.  He was completely baffled by the
concept of a "live set" and threw a little fit when he
saw that we were brining in all kinds of extra gear
and one extra speaker for a little extra bass which
was running off our own amp and mixer.  We only had to
plug one line into the house system and didnt have to
unplug anything.  The funny thing is Dan Mcleod with
my Experimedia team is the one who installed the sound
in Abbasso in the first place because he works for the
company who installed the sound there.  Besides that
the guy just had an attitude the whole night.  Its
like "We are so sorry for trying to make something
cool happen at your failing club."  I am not sure I
will ever be doing another event at that location.  We
are looking to move the Lectro night elsewhere if
anyone has any suggestions.  I am also calling around
for an opening at a good venue on Saturday May 15th
for a Movement (DEMF) festival related event.  Thanks
to everyone that came out and supported the show and
artists...Trout, Todd, and anyone else from this list
that were there.

Subject: {pb-cle} secton 305 of the CLEAN-UP act

The Continuation of
the War Against Drugs The U.S.

Government has gone even a step further in it's perseverance to put an end 
to the nightlife scene in the U.S. According to ProtectLiveMusic.com, 
"Section 305 of the CLEAN-UP Act would make it a crime punishable by fines 
and up to nine years in federal prison  to "knowingly promote any rave, 
dance, music, or other entertainment event, that takes place under 
circumstances where the promoter knows or reasonably ought to know that a 
controlled substance will be used or distributed."

so...=20

My brother and I were both born excactly on Thanksgiving day, 2 years =
apart. A few years later my aunt had 2 children, which one of them were =
born around the date of my brother and I. The last time I was able to =
come back to Ohio for a "Holiday Family Get Together" was Thanksgiving. =
Seeming we all decided to celebrate all out birthdays, on turkey day.. I =
made sure I could come home for it. I bent myself backwards to make it =
home especially for that, to the point where I wasnt able to make it =
back for Christmas this past year... (2003)

anyways... my point of this email was because, I went home the night I =
played for "Fire" for a week, and I was actually able to open my =
Christmas presents from my family while I was there. I wouldnt let them =
send them to me in the mail because the feelings arent the same when =
we're all standing there in one room, even tho I couldnt be home to see =
everyones faces for Christmas as well. All in all, I just wanted my =
family to know I appreciate them in a special way...
=20
So I open my presents from my 2 little cousins who happen to be...  Kara =
: 9   and Kevin : 7. They both decide to give me 2 presents, from both =
of them at the same time. My one present was some new nose posts, =
because I got a new nose peircing when I moved out. "thank god they got =
me these because they are freaking awesome"... ill show them to you guys =
if you ever ask...

and the other present the got me was a "new cd". You have to understand =
that these are 2 kids at the age of 9, and 7... and they mean no harm at =
all. The other present I open is a 2 disc cd, .....  Paul Oakenfold's, =
The Wall. I kinda looked at it at first like, "oh man", but they cant =
put the difference between "techno", and what style I play in the =
scene..  jesus, theyre just kids. (Not to mention the fact that, the =
only type of "techno" theyve ever heard was TRANCE anyways.". They do =
know that I have an envolvment with something that "is" considered =
electronica, so they went out and got me this disc. (on another note, im =
kinda drunk trying to explain this.. so god forgive me if i didnt give =
the pb-clev list my life story behind my 2 cousins having an interest in =
"rave music".... giggle)

anyways,.. I cant say that Ive never listened to anything BUT dnb, =
because that isnt my personality at all. I do own a few Oakenfold discs =
in my car in which I do listen to once in a while. BUT... I can say that =
there is only a few tracks that I honestly like..... its like this...

I come home from work on a hard day... I put on this Croaknfold disc =
(oops), and think to myself..  this tracks awesome... it makes me feel =
as if Im calm now. Thats pretty much how it is.....

ANYWAYS.... I decided to listen theset 2 mixes from front to back not =
only once, but a few times. One disc seems to be for "trance", ... while =
the other is directed towards "breaks". I kinda like how it was a 2 disc =
offer and wasnt totally towards trance, but directed towards something a =
little different. (for oakenfold atleast.)..

Yes.... I am saying that I have been enjoying both discs... considering =
the fact that John B has not one, but 2 tunes on each disc as well. =
Check out his version of "Mercury Skies", and "Freak" if youre able to.

Thank god for my little two under age cousins who can point my musice =
view in another direction these days. It goes to show that politics, =
dont mean shit when people keep it super real. (well that coule be a =
debate as well too)...

I just gotta say that these two kids always showed me love, and this is =
the reason why Ive come to love kids to death, no matter who's kid it is.

The ones from Philly...

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Well tonight is Plate Tectonics @ Touch, and I'm looking forward to it, so just thought I'd post a reminder. If you need some reasons to come out (Why I cannot imagine) here's a few:
 
*****There's some *ahem* rumor that we'll be the first to hear the pressings of Technoir's 4th release. 
 
*****Everyone should celebrate the fantastic Meghan's birthday (and for that matter support her tomorrow @ W.A.R. too!)
 
*****It's a perfect opportunity for those of you as jealous as I to harrass Jamie over his flying out to Germany tomorrow for a week. 
 
*****This is NOT at Abbasso (R.I.P), so I highly doubt any mgmt. issues. 
 
******The weather is absolutley fantastic!
 
*****The Technoir crew seriously has some mad skills.
 
*****uh...LIVE PA
 
*****And ---only $5, if you count Damon opening---that's not even $1 a DJ!
 
*****and you can make fun of me for being such a cheeseball (but you know I love having all our friends out---makes it so much more fun!)
 
So here's the basic details again:
Plate Tectonics Version 4 -:- Friday April 16, 2004 -:- Touch Supper Club
Cover: $5

9pm-2:30am-:-21+ Please-:-Dress to Dance

Touch Supper Club
2710 Lorain Ave
Ohio City
216-631-5200

Technoir audio (Pittsburgh PA) featuring:
Shawn Rudiman
Jwan Allen
Luke Owens
Chris O'Connor
Adam Ratana
and support from Damon Havill (Plate Tec./Cleveland)

Hot hot HOTNESS....

there's such an 80's feel about this release...i expected to see axel foley and depeche mode pop up
dancing from behind my cube wall when i was listening...

you ohio heads who don't get to see the Technoir guys all that often really need to go to see this.
they make the whole "simultaneous live pa + dj's" thing look so ridiculously easy, it's unreal.

go. be there.

meanwhile, i'll be here trying to get off their dicks.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: (BSP kinda) Webhosting special

Remember when I mentioned that 9.95 deal a few months ago? well I just went to 
their website and noticed another special.  It's basically the same thing, 
except it's 19.95 and open to everyone, both old and new customers.  Here's 
the basic stats on it:

Debian based (i.e. no ASP or other micro$oft crap)
1600 MB space
40 gb of file transfers
host up to 15 full domains, 75 subdomains.
miva merchant license
anonymous ftp
...bunch of other stuff

This expires "At any time." and that 19.95 price is good for as long as you 
have it, it's never going to go up to 39.95, which is the regular price for 
it.

DISCLAIMER:
No, I don't work for them, but I do get a little bit (eitehr 5% or 10%) of 
whatever the people I refer pay.  Doesn't cost you any more and if I get 
enough people I can get mine paid for completely by referrals :)  just use 
this address:

http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?vrillusions

and if you want to be lame and not do the referral, I'm sure you can figure 
out how to get to their main site.

Most of the members of Technoir Audio were out at Havana last night and 
Shawn gave us a taste getting Curt Jackson to play two of the new songs off 
the test pressing.  Curt played one track at the end of his set and when the 
song was over the next dj wasn't ready to go so Curt just flipped the record 
over and played a second song.

Perfect segue into Spencer Products all out 80's set.

I don't remember sending any emails about any other Hive, especially from
Philly? Armanni is from Philly, but I don't see any other connections?
Regardless, there is one and only Hive (at least in the DnB world now), and
he's definitely been churning out some hotness.

If I did send it last week, and I'm so dazed and confused that I don't
remember, sorry, but this is the updated event details. Brace yourselves for
$3 Jaeger Bombs and $2 Long Islands. Also the cover is reduced now to $7 due
to time constraints.

If your going to buy one Drum and Bass CD all year, this is it! It's
finallly been released after being pushed back TWICE from its original
scheduled release in Novemeber or Decemeber? Regardless, many of these
tracks are still fresh.

For those that don't know, Swarm is 3 of Philly's hottest up and coming
producers, D'Star, Trust, and Myster Mason, and have been signed to
Metalheadz in UK. The FIRST Stateside producers to have accomplished such.
Cameo appearances on the CD by MC's Armanni Reign and Sharpness (aka Mental
Sharp when together).

Here's a CD sampler:
www.mystermason.com/wma/ethsampler.wax

And a video of what happens to those that get in Swarm's way (Jes, notice
Odi making a special appearance at 2:06):

Ah that?s right. Well those guys are definitely a talented bunch. Armanni is
their main emcee that you might have heard on the sampler?

The two main differences between Swarm and Hive, is that Swarm is a young
group of VERY talented producers that are newly discovered and have yet to
blow up (from Philly), where as Hive (San Francisco) has been around touring
for years, but just in the last year has produced some killer tunes that has
secured him as one of the top dnb guys around. Also, Philadelphia is
considered by many the DnB capital in america, or at least anywhere on this
side of the Mississipi. Ironically, San Fran is the same way on the west
coast, with none other than Hive leading the pack their.

I hope you dnb heads realize the magnitude of the talent on this bill. As
for many of you non-junglists, you really need to get past your AK 1200s and
Dieselboys and taste something new. Seriously.

<<Ah that?s right. Well those guys are definitely a talented bunch. Armanni is their main emcee that

Yeah, that's what screwed me up. I made the connection between him and the various 'bee'
references...hive, swarm...you get the picture.

Thing I liked about Swarm's tracks were that they didn't sound like 99% of the other crap that's
been around forever that I'm so tired of in DnB. I'm by no means a "junglist", and even less of a
purist...so their sound was kinda new to me and I was fairly impressed by it.

That "philly" track they had was super-duper hot. Want to hear the whole thing.

<<As for many of you non-junglists, you really need to get past your AK 1200s and Dieselboys and

Been waiting for it for it. Bring it on.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not a Tom-level dnb-basher. I just got worn out on the current crop of producers.

hive's "neo" song was good, very old school metalheadz epic 
techstep sounding. his other stuff im not really sure about. the 
tru playaz shit is boring, i forget which other ones i 
particularly disliked, but neo is the joint.

i realize this is old now, but i lost my internet last
week.

you seem to have missed the part that i am concerned
about, i don't care about them using my mail to
trigger pop-ups, i have a problem with the part that
says that they will keep emails on file for an
unspecified amount of time, and presumably (google
refuses to take any stance at all on wether they
believe it is wrong to sell personal information)
release these emails to anyone who comes looking.
information is not just a cash-crop anymore, people
are keeping track of what we do and say, who we said
it to, and when, what we buy, where we go, what books
we read; they are recording and reading our private
conversations in order to use against us for their own
benefit or profit. if you think there's nothing wrong
with that that's your business. i personally don't
like it. maybe you're one of those people who thinks
that privacy is of no use to them. time will solve all
debates.

well for one, i don't use hotmail, but i do not hold
the belief that yahoo is any better in the end. to me
the size of the company is proportional to the desire
for further growth and profit, ergo the potential for
dishonesty and corruption to that end, and therefore
also to the amount of paranioa which is warranted
thereby of anyone who's learned that honesty and
success rarely go together in business or politics, if
ever. winston chruchill said: "in times of war, the
truth must be gaurded at all times and on all sides by
a bodyguard of lies" -- so those who know ensure that
we are perpetually at war, and paranioia becomes
another word for lost naivete. i really don't think a
tin hat will do much good. =)

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Where did all city beats move to?

If you are talking about acb in columbus, they closed down around this time
last year because half their store was also a head shop, and they closed
because they werent going to sell any more glass, and on the acb stuff
alone, they weren't gonna cut it... I got some phat ass discounts when I
went there the week they were closing up shop... (unless they reopened
somewhere else in town as a non-part head shop/part acb and I didn't know
about it since I moved)

Yeah, steph c said something about dropping off some bassline mags there, I
figured it was somewhere, unless she lives in a cave deeper than mine. I
just thought I'd explore high street today --yes the bums are worse than
ever.

I so don't miss anything about college other than hot girls everywhere.

Also, I nearly killed an emo kid for his tshirt.

Subject: {pb-cle} Hedonism April 24, venue change

Sorry, if this was already posted, I need to catch up
on my emails in here ...
Steph*C


Post from Sceneohio.com-
I would like to announce that HEDONISM on 4/24/04 will
be moved to Columbus instead of Dayton. I have decided
to switch venues for the overall saftey and security
of the party. The new venue is much larger than the
previous and will have no problems fitting thousands
of people, if need be. There will be a large fenced in
outdoor area. 
If at least 30 people from the Cincinnati/Dayton area
email Drew at positivephlow@yahoo.com, there will be
charter bus service to and from the party that will
leave Cincinnati stop in Dayton and arrive in
Columbus. 
Directions and an address of the venue will be posted
early next week. Timeslots will also be posted next
week. 
Everything is locked and loaded, all headliners are
confirmed. See ya'll next week.

Subject: {pb-cle} ALL CITY BEATS is still alive!!!  support them!!

Hey, All City Beats has moved right above the Pita Pit
on High Street. I don't have the address with me now,
but whomever needs it, please email me back at
stephanie@basslinemagazine.com * NOT THIS ADDY!  THIS
IS FOR LISTSERVE ONLY! THANKS!*

ACB is upstairs on the left. There's stickers on the
downstairs door, and usually you can hear dnb comin'
from the speakers they have hooked up near the
entrance. There's a sub shop thingy on the left if you
are looking at the building. If you park near the
Wendy's parking lot spots, walk around the corner to
the left down about half a block, that's where it is.

GO ASK CLAY FOR BASSLINE MAGAZINE! THERE'S A COUPON
INSIDE!!!
Peace,
stephanie*c

Subject: {pb-cle} the old Higher Ground in C-bus - what it is now ...

Higher Ground is no longer around, however both owners
are doing their own thing. Like the last email, All
City Beats has moved above the Pita Pit, and they sell
records, some clothing, CDs, mags, etc. Also, Crow has
moved his glass part of Higher Ground down by the
Ethiopian Resturant/ Blue Danube area  and it's now
called "Underground Glass". If you're heading away
from campus, it's on your left hand side. He pretty
much only sells glassware as far as I could see. He
told me he didn't have a phone number there at that
point, which was in February.

Go out and support them so they continue to be open!
Steph

(your pseudo columbus connection)

It was a good night, and not just weather wise, either.  It was funny 
when boompsie and meghan were playing this hard break beat stuff for 
the first hour or so and everyone was just like, where's the techno?  
Well the wait was definitely worth it.  Wish I had my camera ready 
when at one point boompsie told meghan "Something harder" while she's 
pounding her fist against her hand like some no neck bouncer :)  I 
was supposed to leave early because of work but I figured I'd just 
stick another 15 mins, then another 15 mins, then another 15 mins 
till it ended.  Fortunately work wasn't too busy :) .

Subject: {pb-cle} Beat Matrix 04.19.2003 | wruw fm 91.1 | 10:30 pm

Hola aficionados, 

I would like thank all of you that called in to make pledges to this year's
Telethon.  We raised lots of money, which will of course be used to make
WRUW the coolest darn community radio station there could possibly be in
Cleveland.  Of course the Beat Matrix Crew will do its best to influence the
powers that be to direct lots of money towards improving our DJ booth
thingy, which means our live mixes will be oh-so-sweeter.  

This week the BMC brings you Computo, who will be the first laptopper to
grace the live mix portion of our show.  With his trusty laptop (much like a
cowboy's trusty steed), he will treat us to tracks ranging from drum and
bass to breaks to glitch to downtempo.  This is seriously going to be a
treat.

I've been listening to lots of random stuff over the past week that i'm
dying to play, so get mentally prepared for my usual juxtaposition of just
about everything.  

Last weeks playlist is available at beatmatrix.net and an mp3 archive at
WRUW.org.

As usual, we start at 10:30p and start the live mix at 11:00 on 91.1 FM.

If this is spam please drop a short reply.  And do let us know how we can
support you.

-Calvin

Last night I rented an awesome movie called "Fear of a Black Hat." It is
done in the satirical, mockumentary style of Spinal Tap. This movie makes
light of the whole gangsta rap phenomenon. I suppose CB4 did the exact
same thing, but this is worth a watch. The main characters are named Ice
Cold, Tone Def, and Tasty Taste. Collectively they are knows as N.W.H.,
or: "Niggaz With Hats"

Check it out.

The Third Eye V.5 - Techno Version
Presented by Goahead Productions

Friday, May 28, 2004 - Cleveland, OH

A warm up for DEMF!!

Goahead productions continues The Third Eye ritual. Don't miss this
soulful experience as we get deep into the roots!

Trevor Lamont - Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands. He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about
the sounds of house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony
Humphies, Lil Louie Vega, and Frankie Knuckles. Eventually he got his own
tables and decided to take that step on the other side of the table.
Through years of decication and practice to his form he has made himself
into a very accomplished house D.J. Trevor has traveled all over sharing
his unique style of mixing house. His style is very mix intensive. If you
watch him you'll notice that he's constantly in the mix and that helps to
bring about nice textured and thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets
are usually very sexy and deep. He can pump it up though and has been know
to drop the occasional surprise techno sets.

RYSKI - BerettaMusic/ColorRecordings/www.ryski.com - Detroit, MI
::::::::::::::::::
Ryski currently resides in Detroit where he owns and operates the
Berettamusic record label with Brian Kage. His productions have been
described as techy, funky and sometimes off the wall which seems to mirror
his
quirky attitude. He lived overseas for 5 years (Japan for 3 years and
Guam for 2) where he sharpened his skills on the decks and learned the
importance of reading a crowd. This eventually led into production where
he finds solace in both house and techno genres; as evident by his
releases on Berettamusic that have a defined techy edge as well as his
funky and quirky house sound which can be heard on his newly signed "With
You" track to Colorecordings in the Spring of 04'. He also records with
Kage under the alias "Airport Society" where he brings out a deeper and
more minimal approach to his sound. Look for great things from Ryski as
his funk infused brand of techno-house edges it's way out of Detroit
and into spots worldwide.

KAGE - BerettaMusic/Azure Records/Lumina Records/www.djkage.com - Detroit, MI
::::::::::::::::::
Brian Kage (Pronounced Ka-ghei), is a deep tech-house Producer/DJ from
Detroit. Kage's tracks have been receiving great reviews from his peers
across the country. He's signed three of his tracks to Adam Jay's Azure
Records for World-Wide release. Lumina Records in France have also
picked up six of his tunes for release. Kage's also working on original
tracks & remixes for labels such as Z'n Recordings, Open Source &
Berettamusic. Kage has been playing out since '99, with notable appearances
including Nefarious Booth at DEMF'01, DEMF'02, DEMF'03, legendary Detroit
club Motor, Necto in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Duotone in Los Angeles,
California, & the Azure Records Night in Indianapolis, Indiana. Expect this
rising star to soon be visible around the globe..

ANDY JAMES - Goahead Productions/BerettaMusic/Soniktexture
Recordings/www.koala-tea.com - Cleveland, OH

Inspired by earlier electronic groups like Kraftwerk, New Order, Orbital, The
Shamen, 808 State and Underworld, Andy James first started going to
parties in 1998.
Some of the DJs he saw that year included Adam Beyer, Marco Carola, Joel
Mull,
Christian Smith, Cari Lekebusch and Claude Young. At the time he had no
idea who
they were, but the records they were playing and the way they were mixing
them
definitely had an impact on him. Techno was infused in his blood and he
needed a
release. Andy started spinning records in 1999 and hasn't looked back since.

Always known for rocking the hard and funky techno beats, Andy has risen
to become
one of the Midwests hardest working techno DJs. In 2000, after only
spinning for 6
months, he competed and placed second out of eight DJs at the Atomic
Battle of the
DJs held at the Metropol, Pittsburghs largest club -- 800 people were in
attendance
for the finals! Andy has played alongside Stacey Pullen, Frankie Bones, David
Hollands, Punisher, Barry Weaver, Scott & Robbie Hardkiss, Shawn Rudiman,
and Dan
Curtin to name a few. Currently, Andy is playing at various weeklies, club
events,
parties and radio shows in and around Ohio, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and
various other
cities around the East Coast and Midwest. With his 13 released mixes, Andy
has
caused a serious buzz around the Midwest, East Coast and on the Internet.
Andy's
fast-paced mixing skills and unique technical style on 3 decks have
allowed his DJ
schedule to grow by the minute.

Andy's talents extend beyond the turntables, as he has been producing
original
techno tracks with partner Don Lisy under the name Moonplastic since 2000.
Just like
Andy's DJ sets, a Moonplastic track is best described as powerful peak time
floor-shaking, fist-pumping techno with sweeping breakdowns and cleverly
programmed
loops and beats. In 2002, they released 100 copies of their first demo EP
on their
own to techno DJs, producers and labels in Europe and America. Although
nothing got
signed, the feedback was very positive and it pushed them to take their
productions
to the next level. Andys energy has been consumed in his many DJ
bookings, but also
in the studio with Don preparing for techno world domination. Keep on the
lookout
for original tracks and collaborations to be released on BerettaMusic
(Detroit) and
on Moonplastic's forthcoming label Soniktexture in 2004.

Subject: {pb-cle} Soundcard choice

I'm thinking about upgrading my soundcard. 

General use is input/recording from a turntable mixer, output to my 
stereo, playing MP3's, and fucking around with Reason and Ableton Live. 

I'm currently looking at either the M-Audio Audiophile 2496 (PCI) or the 
USB version of the same.

Good idea?  Bad idea?  Better with USB?  Worse?  My computer's a little 
shuttle case with one - and only one - PCI slot in it, currently free.

I'm not a terribly spec savy guy, but I know USB has a lag, and I have a PCI
M audio Delta 66, and it works fucking great.

USB Is fine. I have an M-Audio quattro and a Duo addon and it has 3ms 
latency. I like USB because it's harder to put a PCI card in a laptop. 
This is a plus if you're fiddling with Live, and ever expect to use it 
live. The only thing I find finicky with USB stuff is drivers, but if 
M-Audio is pretty good about those these days.

I've looked at the 44 and 66, and I really don't want 1/4" ins/outs so 
much, unless they're supposedly uber-spiffier than RCA.  Hell, if I was 
really interested, would probably just skip the 1/4 to jump to XLR...

...which is why I'm looking at the PCI or USB Audiophile instead of the 
Delta 44 or 66.  I think.

:)

So far, thinking the $150 PCI card might be the best route.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Soundcard choice

You mean an Audigy 2 or Audigy?
Both do 5.1 surround.

When I step up, I'm not worried about 'most bang for my buck'.  I'm more 
concerned with 'most bang for what I actually do with it'.  Thus, the 
M-Audio stuff...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Soundcard choice

Quite unrelated, but I'd make sure you pick up something like an Oxygen  
8, a UC-33, or an X Session,as long as you're sound card shopping. I've  
given some thought to running the deck outs into the inputs of my USB  
Quattro, but I'm out of space in that part of the "Studio". There's  
quite a bit of hype about DJ'ing with live, and you could use it as  
your mixer, quite like how Nick S mentioned recording mixes into a four  
track (with each deck doing into a separate track). You'd get live  
sampling and looping, you could add your own stuff, and Live takes care  
of all the tempo and beat matching (with the internal samples, you  
still have to DJ). Live's time stretching / warping feature would be a  
30 second fix to a few hours of importing into Cubase and fucking  
around with it to fix wrecks / tweak mixes. Plus, you've got the added  
ability to control all sorts of VST and Live's built into effects via  
the controller, which you could apply to any input source and have  
synced to the midi clock, which you've conveniently tapped tempo to the  
records.

BT recorded a live Earth Wind & Fire performance @ the last NAMM show,  
then did a remix on the fly, which came out insanely good. I'm quite in  
awe of the Electric Skychurch live performance too, and am so in need  
of a singer of that caliber now. Check out the videos here:  
http://www.m-audio.com/index.php? 
do=media.new&ID=71c16dc34b30d98c7c9dcb9e8c53e0dc

I think I'm going to pick up a new desk on the way home today now. MMM.  
Goodness.

im pretty sure theres more than 2 models of the sound blaster...i know they 
offer a 6.1 version too,audigy offers other models of sound cards too that are 
more upper end.....but amoungst all of my friends and I that have purchased 
one(a great number)ive heard very few bad reviews of any audigy product,it seems 
to be a standard amounst people making tracks at home,if your looking for 
higher end,id advise to really check out all of audigy's products


nick






You mean an Audigy 2 or Audigy?
Both do 5.1 surround.

When I step up, I'm not worried about 'most bang for my buck'.  I'm more 
concerned with 'most bang for what I actually do with it'.  Thus, the 
M-Audio stuff...

The M-Audio 2496 is the best one for the price and it works great so in my personal opinon I'd say go for that one.

Dean <deankjackson@hotmail.com> wrote:I'm thinking about upgrading my soundcard. 

General use is input/recording from a turntable mixer, output to my 
stereo, playing MP3's, and fucking around with Reason and Ableton Live. 

I'm currently looking at either the M-Audio Audiophile 2496 (PCI) or the 
USB version of the same.

Good idea? Bad idea? Better with USB? Worse? My computer's a little 
shuttle case with one - and only one - PCI slot in it, currently free.

i actually dont even bother listening to his new joints anymore. i 
heard the one thing on the recent hospital LP that isnt out yet, 
and it was just kinda cheesy drum and bass stuff, not the 
electrocrap shite hes been known to do. saw he had some stuff on 
an oakenfold mix. boy, it took him less than 6 years to come from 
like nowhere (starburst!) to becoming a total joker. sad.

Subject: {pb-cle} BOOM 420 Psyence

What is "Bom Shankar"?

Working backwards:

Shankar is a name for Shiva, one the 3 main dieties in the Indian
pantheon. His dance is the rythm of
the world, the beat of the heart, the cycle of day and night. He lives in
the Himalayas, and lies in the
mountains smoking cannabis and his hair flows down from the mountains as
the holy river Ganges.

His worhippers include "sadhus" wandering mendicants whose worship
includes smoking chillums
of hash, so they became very popular with the wandering freak set India.

bom, or boom, or bem, or bam is a sound -- a sharp sound.

Boom Shiva: it is said by sadhus before they light the chillum to :
a) sanctify it Shiva
b) let Shiva know the chillum is being smoked
c) let other sadhus et al know to come share a chillum

Loosely translted as : OH shiva..im smoking a chillum, hey you sadhus,
come and share it with me"

Other varients: boom, bem, bom, bam, boom, boom shiva, boom mahadev
(greatgod), bembaleh.

Love Boms,
Luke

Subject: {pb-cle} Geargasm April Songmode Techno Mix

I decided to put out a mix this month under Geargasm (yet another name 
for me), available @

http://www.geargasm.com/sounds/Geargasm_-_Songmode_April_Mix.m4a

If the Direct one doesn't work, it's also available @ 
http://www.geargasm.com/audio.htm as the first link. I just didn't feel 
like diddling with vi enough today to put it in the right category.

Note: This is in AAC format, playable by Winamp & iTunes, saves me 
bandwidth and is better quality at that bit rate.

Tracklisting:

1. The Future Is On Fire pt. 3 - Christian Morgenstern
2. Random fills
3. My last travel (T2 Special Mix) - SCSI-9
4. Echoes (Dub Mix) - Alexander Kowalski
5. Imbalanced - Diego & Voco Derman
6. reminder (T2 special mix) - da pop
7. View from up here - Highrise
8. Renounce - Double X
9. Time Has Changed - Codec & Flexor
10. Phoenix 1.1 - Alter Ego
11. nine of eleven (T2 Special Mix) - SCSI-9
12. Beautiful Sisters - Sikora
13. The Gathering and Departure - Christian Morgenstern
14. Phasis - Alexander Kowalski
15. Ornaments (Re Inhaled) - Heiko Laux

-  Mike

Subject: {pb-cle} nrr: In the beginning

...Oh long before that. When light was deciding who should be in and who 
should be out of the spectrum, Yellow was in trouble. Even then, seems that 
Green (you know how Green can be) didn't want Yellow in. Some silly primal 
envy I suppose, but for whatever cause, the effect was bad on Yellow, and 
caused Yellow to weep Yellow tears for several eternals, before there were 
years.

Until Blue heard what was up between Green and Yellow, and took Green aside 
for a serious talk, in which Blue pointed out, that if Yellow and Blue were 
to get together, not that they would but if they did, the gentle threat, 
they could make their own Green. "Oh" said Green with some undertsanding. 
Naturally by a sudden change of hue green saw the light and yellow got in, 
worked out fine. Yellow got lemons, and Green got limes.

Subject: {pb-cle} ANALOG PUSSY

Hi

When we produced "Trance N Roll" in our studios, we weren't sure what will
be the
reactions.
Melting together Rock, Punk, Reggae and Psychedelic Trance was a daring move.
We decided to go for it and rebel the traditional generic trance.

We are overwhelmed with the feedbacks we received. For maximum impact -
See the
Videos !

AP Playing live last week in Tokyo:
http://www.analogpussy.com/y/video/japan/

Enjoy !
Jiga + Jinno

This also works now

http://www.geargasm.com/sounds/Geargasm_-_Songmode_April_Mix.mp3

The other one is still higher quality on the audio side, and a 10MB 
smaller download.

You guys just take things too seriously ; )  I can't wait for that remix to
come out on plate.  The electric boobies remix of American girls has been
pretty popular at the little house parties I've been playing at.  Sure its
corny as hell, but cheese is good if folks know you're just having fun.

I hear they are big in Chicago...i mean like beyond Psy Trance big...this

Trance.

Hi everyone!
 I am sending out this e-mail because we are in the process of gathering our ideas together for issue 2 of Bassline, which will be due out in August. We are still in need to contributing writers and photographers. Please look over our story ideas and existing department features for issue two and let us know what specific area you would be interested in doing. Regarding the following story ideas ... if more than one person responds and is interested in doing a story, I'll let you know more details about what we could work out. Thanks so much in advance, and we hope to be hearing from you soon!

ISSUE 2**************************************

FEATURES
-Jesse Saunders' On&On Tour 2004 (interview already done by me - story still
to be written) *STORY TO BE WRITTEN BY REBECCA, ASSOCIATE EDITOR

w/ local house DJs highlighted: Trevor Lamont (Lexington, KY); 7UP
(Pittsburgh, PA) find 2 more -- possibly Sean Michaels from Chicago, but I'd
like to get a Baltimore or DC house DJ to round it out. *LOOKING FOR WRITERS
TO HELP CONTRIBUTE TO THIS STORY, WILL NEED PHOTOGRAPHERS

-Live electronic / hip-hop bands- w/ Monster Movies (Columbus hip-hop
group); Voight-Kampff (Cincy- dnb band); Tortured Souls(NYC house group);
Big In Japan (Baltimore- dnb band) ** find one
more? *STILL LOOKING FOR SOME WRITERS, PHOTOGRAPHER

- "Message board Mania" and "Serving it Up- E-mail style" (just ex.
titles)Message boarding / list serves ... how the rave culture / hip hop
too? survives on them. i want this to be a light hearted, cool 'i can relate
to that' piece.  Intro concept - "Unlike many other music scenes, perhaps
none thrives as much on the art of messageboarding and list serves as does
the electronic culture."
just SOME of the sites i've compiled so far:
Philly- phillyjunglemassive.com, reflective.net, phillybeats.com,
bassmentcru.net, maneo.com; B-more- eastcoastdnb.com; DC- dcdnb.com; Ohio-
sceneohio.com, bluelight.nu, ravetrash.com, columbusunderground.com, pb-cle
list serve on hyperreal.org; Pbgh- lolli.org, pb-cle list;
Kentucky-louipimps.com; Indy-sceneindiana.com *LOOKING FOR WRITERS

We also have a section called Spotlight which profile up-and-coming DJs,
producers, MCs. Those interviews will most likely be done via e-mail or by
myself, however I will be looking for photographers. When those people are
confirmed, I will send out another e-mail. Also, I may be needing
photographers for our Hot Wax (12" vinyl reviewers) bios.

We will be having a new department for news and events and misc items. I am
looking for reviewers of these items below:
CD/EP releases---------------------------------
- Dieselboy's new CD, release date June
- Rhymesayers artists: Brother Ali, "Champion" EP TBA; MF Doom, "Food"
12"/CD/2XLP, TBA

Label news------------------------------------------
BerrettaMusic (Detroit)*LINDSEY COVERING
Headrush Music / Toes in the Sand (Cleveland)*LINDSEY COVERING

Philly
Miscellaneous news------------------------------------

Subject: {pb-cle} (BSP) Andy Sine w/ Osmotic vs. Meghan @ Fresh

This week @ Fresh...

Twin Productions is proud to bring you...


ANDY SINE (Platinum) Philadelphia, PA


After moving to Philly in the early months of
2000, Sine was granted a residency at one of the
most recognizable drum and bass weekly's,
Platinum.It is here, alongside co - resident
Dieselboy that Sine has really honed his crowd
moving abilities. "Platinum gives me a chance to
really try tunes out and see if they are all
they are cracked up to be. Our crowd is one of
the most sophisticated and knowledgeable crowds
around trainspotters galore. If they go off,
then I know its running and it will work."
Platinum has also given Sine the opportunity to
play alongside the biggest names in the world of
drum and bass music, from Andy C to Trace: you
name the name and they have been through those
doors.It wasn't until the summer of 2000 that
Sine really started to get back into serious
production. In the past 3 years he has released
singles and remixes on 3 different labels.
Countermeasure and Quantico on Elite Recordings,
Revolver on 611 DNB, and as part of the Weapon
collective, remixes of Technical Itch-Reborn and
Robbie Rivera-Harder and Faster, both on Moving
Shadow. These Moving Shadow releases have been
cained heavily on dubplate by Dom & Roland,
Dylan, John B, Moving Fusion, and Technical
Itch. Dom went so far as to say, "Reborn rmx is
the tune of 2002"

Osmotic (Twin, Inner Child) PGH, PA
VS.
Meghan (Goahead)

These 2 performers have a deep history in their
respected scenes, and have become 2 of the
biggest names between Pittsburgh and Cleveland.
Both of these dj's have the knowledge and track
selection to make a dance floor shake, and are
well prepared for a packed night at "fresh". On
a night like tonight, who knows what's gonna
happen, but i can gaurantee it's gonna be one to
remember!



Residents:

Ted Zelch (Twin, Fused, 412groove.com) PGH, PA

DVS (Twin, House of Styles, Inner Child House
Collective, koala-tea.com,
phictitionalphysics.com, 412groove.com,
innerchild.biz) PGH, PA

The drink special is OFF THE HOOK, w/ 4 DOLLAR
RED BULL AND STOLI'S. I hope to see everyone out
this week, These 3 performers are gonna make it
a night to remember!
"FRESH" Happens every Friday night from 10pm -2am,
Located @ Zythos / Memphis Lounge(upstairs)
2108 East Carson St.
Pittsburgh PA(South Side)
5 bux for the guys, 3 bux for the ladies

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} art all night 2004

make sure to check out the section with all the work
done by kids.  if you're gonna bid on something, you
can't pass up the chance at bidding on some of this
stuff.  + the kids actually call you and meet you if you
win their stuff.  i lost an auction last year, but my friend
liz (where is liz ?) won another one.  i hope to secure
something cool this year.

not sure if 'carp all night' is happening this year.  but
after you get some cool art, head down to the river
and fish.  i missed out on that last time too - sounded
like a good party   : )

Heh I'm working right on the edge of macedonia.  Anyway, I'm going to be busy 
installing arch linux on my server at home tonight.  Been preparing for this 
all week getting everything important on the server backed up.  Forgot all 
about tonight.  I'll probably go to the one tomorro, though.

www.masterpieceav.com USED to have them, but it appears they've been bought by another company that
doesn't stock them.

I'll take a look around and see what I can find.

This week @ Fresh...

Twin Productions is proud to bring you...


ANDY SINE (Platinum) Philadelphia, PA


After moving to Philly in the early months of 2000, Sine was granted a
residency at one of the most recognizable drum and bass weekly's,
Platinum.It is here, alongside co - resident Dieselboy that Sine has really
honed his crowd moving abilities. "Platinum gives me a chance to really try
tunes out and see if they are all they are cracked up to be. Our crowd is
one of the most sophisticated and knowledgeable crowds around trainspotters
galore. If they go off, then I know its running and it will work."
Platinum has also given Sine the opportunity to play alongside the biggest
names in the world of drum and bass music, from Andy C to Trace: you name
the name and they have been through those doors.It wasn't until the summer
of 2000 that Sine really started to get back into serious production. In the
past 3 years he has released singles and remixes on 3 different labels.
Countermeasure and Quantico on Elite Recordings, Revolver on 611 DNB, and as
part of the Weapon collective, remixes of Technical Itch-Reborn and Robbie
Rivera-Harder and Faster, both on Moving Shadow. These Moving Shadow
releases have been cained heavily on dubplate by Dom & Roland, Dylan, John
B, Moving Fusion, and Technical Itch. Dom went so far as to say, "Reborn rmx
is the tune of 2002"

Osmotic (Twin, Inner Child) PGH, PA
VS.
Meghan (Goahead)

These 2 performers have a deep history in their respected scenes, and have
become 2 of the biggest names between Pittsburgh and Cleveland.
Both of these dj's have the knowledge and track selection to make a dance
floor shake, and are well prepared for a packed night at "fresh". On a night
like tonight, who knows what's gonna happen, but i can gaurantee it's gonna
be one to remember!



Residents:

Ted Zelch (Twin, Fused, 412groove.com) PGH, PA

DVS (Twin, House of Styles, Inner Child House Collective, koala-tea.com,
phictitionalphysics.com, 412groove.com,
innerchild.biz) PGH, PA

The drink special is OFF THE HOOK, w/ 4 DOLLAR RED BULL AND STOLI'S. I hope
to see everyone out this week, These 3 performers are gonna make it a night
to remember!
"FRESH" Happens every Friday night from 10pm -2am, Located @ Zythos /
Memphis Lounge(upstairs)
2108 East Carson St.
Pittsburgh PA(South Side)
5 bux for the guys, 3 bux for the ladies

Join the crowd.  I get customers complaining about this all day.  What's 
happening is someone that has you on their address book has a virus.  What 
the virus does is try to replicate itself by sending emails to everyone in 
the infected person's address book.  It then picks a random person in that 
list to say who it's from.  Then the receive computer, realizing it's a 
virus, sends a message back to the sender (which is "you" since that what the 
virus put in the from field) that it has a virus, mailbox doesn't exist, etc.  
There's not a thing you can do except hope that whoever has the virus patches 
their computer.

btw, free anti-virus program.  Not bad, and it's a whole lot better than 
nothing:

oh i forget the name of the program, you use sine waves and apply 
pitch/vol envelopes and mix noise and overdrive in and its what 
practically every goa kick sample comes from (well they all use the same 
sounding kick/bass sound).  (or similar processes).....  damn what was 
the name of the program, i can remember astral projection using it to 
pretend they were playing with stuff on the computer. 

stomper, thats it
v5 (beta) http://www.lysator.liu.se/~zap/stomper/index2.html
v4 (stable) http://www.lysator.liu.se/~zap/stomper-old.html

no goa musician should be without it. or any electronic musician for 
that matter.

i've also gotten good ones out of the nord micromodular too.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Psy drum samples

Stomper is pretty badass, Infected Musroom has a tutorial on their site
about using it.

Absynth really rocks the hizzy for that sort of thing too, but alas, I was
at work and had nothing to do. And on my mac. If anyone cares, I have a
whole collection of Absynth drums a friend sent me, just hit me up private
stylee.

stomper is the greatest thing ever. i made this kick last week 
where i layered a bunch of sine waves and a sampled kick from a 
funk record. i then used soundforge to pitch it down and resample 
@ 12 bit. it sounds almost as wicked as any kick ive ever heard.

download this
decompress it to your c: drive
reboot in safe mode
run the program called avg.exe
this is a emergency virus scan
it will tell you if you have a virus
if you do have a virus you will need
to look it up on google, google wil
point you to a site with directions
on how to remove it

also, if you want to be rid of viruses
on your windows PC
stop using outlook and MSIE
get mozilla and use it for internet and mail

i found a place here in town callled a little warehouse...they stock every

i got 2 reels of quantegy 457(i think...gotta look at the cases)on plastic 
reels for 12bux.

i need to get more metal reels tho...and learn hoto load the reels 
faster(takes me about 5 mins to load the takeup reel)

the sound quality is amazing on this deck...i had done some test recording

Subject: {pb-cle} weekend(s) in review

friday:
emerging chrysalis - the preparty, me and bill get out to this little 
coffee shop after stopping like 5 places to buy some vodka. he kept 
stopping at the wrong gas stations, i kept saying he needed more of a 
hood gas station or quick-e mart......   neato little place.  chilled a 
bit, but wasn't really in the mood just yet.   me and nox headed over to 
touch for a bit.  they're closing BTW.  so we've (more or less) lost 
abbasso and now touch.  had a pretty good time there.  wandered back to 
lukes thing and really got my krunk on....  chilled out a bit and ended 
up at an afterparty for a bit out at nox's friends, but i was pretty 
tired.  we split.  loooooong night.......

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/emerging_chrysalis    <--also some "fun" 
and probably blackmail worthy ones at touch are in there...


saturday:
went to wish.  um, left real fast. went to john b, it was hella crowded, 
mercury is NOT that big..... i dug his stuff, bill didn't so we jetted 
to the rites of spring. alex intervied john B i have 99% of it as 
video.  i had my reservations at first about the room being too big, and 
the sound being too small, but i was totally wrong. it was off the 
fucking hook.  the decorations were dope as fuck, TFC visuals ruled, kri 
ruled, magnetrixx was "the hot shit"... albertos sound is VERY VERY 
FUCKING GOOD for such a small setup. also watching alberto show up the 
candy kids was funny.  he actually DANCED while swinging glowy stuff 
around.  and changed it up.  more than the swing in a circle stuff. 
white castle twice in one day, yummmmmm. the 800 mile detour on the way 
to and from cleveland sucked.  the drive to clevo with alex must have 
involved at least 5 or 6 u turns.

(not mine, i think by rob tronix?)
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/rites_spring
oh yeah, i should have the video available from the john b interview in 
a bit. gotta figure out how to make a divx from it, or something more 
compact that it currently is....


i guess a quick blurb about last weekend i forgot to mention then....  
....  the technoir gang was "the hot shit" .....  meghan vs boompsie was 
also "the hot shit". 10 hrs 10 djs: too damn much house.  andy james was 
"the hot shit".  the front door open and hanging out on the sidewalk was 
you guessed it..."the hot shit".  i cant wait to see if the bbq idea 
doug talked about happens.  i'm pretty sure that will be "the hot bbq'd 
shit" (don't eat that!)

Subject: {pb-cle} Photographers read this! Upcoming event pics needed for Bassline Mag

Hi everyone!
 I am sending out this e-mail because we are in the
process of 
gathering our ideas together for issue 2 of Bassline,
which will be due out in 
August. We are still in need to contributing writers
and photographers. 
Please look over our story ideas and existing
department features for 
issue two and let us know what specific area you would
be interested in 
doing. Regarding the following story ideas ... if more
than one person 
responds and is interested in doing a story, I'll let
you know more 
details about what we could work out. Thanks so much
in advance, and we 
hope to be hearing from you soon!

ISSUE 2**************************************

FEATURES
-Jesse Saunders' On&On Tour 2004 (interview already
done by me - story 
still
to be written) *STORY TO BE WRITTEN BY REBECCA,
ASSOCIATE EDITOR

w/ local house DJs highlighted: Trevor Lamont
(Lexington, KY); 7UP
(Pittsburgh, PA) find 2 more -- possibly Sean Michaels
from Chicago, 
but I'd
like to get a Baltimore or DC house DJ to round it
out. *LOOKING FOR 
WRITERS
TO HELP CONTRIBUTE TO THIS STORY, WILL NEED
PHOTOGRAPHERS

-Live electronic / hip-hop bands- w/ Monster Movies
(Columbus hip-hop
group); Voight-Kampff (Cincy- dnb band); Tortured
Souls(NYC house 
group);
Big In Japan (Baltimore- dnb band) ** find one
more? *STILL LOOKING FOR SOME WRITERS, PHOTOGRAPHER

- "Message board Mania" and "Serving it Up- E-mail
style" (just ex.
titles)Message boarding / list serves ... how the rave
culture / hip 
hop
too? survives on them. i want this to be a light
hearted, cool 'i can 
relate
to that' piece.  Intro concept - "Unlike many other
music scenes, 
perhaps
none thrives as much on the art of messageboarding and
list serves as 
does
the electronic culture."
just SOME of the sites i've compiled so far:
Philly- phillyjunglemassive.com, reflective.net,
phillybeats.com,
bassmentcru.net, maneo.com; B-more- eastcoastdnb.com;
DC- dcdnb.com;

pb-cle
list serve on hyperreal.org; Pbgh- lolli.org, pb-cle
list;
Kentucky-louipimps.com; Indy-sceneindiana.com *LOOKING
FOR WRITERS

We also have a section called Spotlight which profile
up-and-coming 
DJs,
producers, MCs. Those interviews will most likely be
done via e-mail or 
by
myself, however I will be looking for photographers.
When those people 
are
confirmed, I will send out another e-mail. Also, I may
be needing
photographers for our Hot Wax (12" vinyl reviewers)
bios.

We will be having a new department for news and events
and misc items.

looking for reviewers of these items below:

I didn't have any problems on the way to the eagle's nest, and I went right by 
cleveland.  Just went up jennings freeway to 90 and voila.  Only time I do u 
turns is when going to touch because the exit I usually get off at you can 
only get off going west bound on 90 and I go up jennings and am going east 
bound when I get to that exit.

Ok..guess I should add quick reviews from last weekend and then this weekend.
 
Thanks to everyone who came  out to Plate Tec for Technoir @ Touch last Friday---it was quite fun! Who knows what the next venue will be...but hopefully the momentum keeps going in the same direction. 
 
Props to Radin, Boompsie and Meghan at W.A.R.  I have to confess I don't think I ever set foot upstairs, but the girls were rocking downstairs.
 
As far as this past weekend...it was sad to see yet another great club go goodbye...my advice is see what Brad and Jude and Nitty Gritty crew try to do with the 1300 gallery...who knows. But anyhow, the music was a proper sendout...the people there earlier in the night were a little whack, and not the usual but it got better as the night went on. 
 
Butterfly (Luke's party)--the drive sucked.  WOW on those visuals.  The ceiling looked quite cool, live video was cool.  The sound really worked.  BBM I thought was a blast, and Uzi played one of his better sets.  I'm sad I didn't get to hear Magnetrixx....too tired after a few hours of dancing my tail off and not looking forward to the hour drive home alone. Very interesting mix of people there--def. less of a local party, and nice to see people get moving earlier in the eve.

Well, shit! This is just tragic. Why are we losing the one spot that I could go to regularly for good beats and never leave disappointed? What's the story? Any last-bash events planned? I feel empty inside...

Hi everyone, 
I wanted to announce that we have our new and updated
media kit including our summer 2004 rate card (stating
our prices and ad sizes) now available. Please e-mail
Lindsey Whited at lindsey@basslinemagazine.com our
advertising/ promotions director to request a media
kit. Our release date for issue 2 is slated for early
August. If you are interested in a color ad, please do

For those of you who received a media kit for our

Subject: {pb-cle} help with torrents...

hey y'all

so i have bit torrent installed. and i can download shit just fine.

is there an app that will let you leave torrents open to seed from your workstation without having a
different item in your task bar for each thing left open?

i don't know if this makes sense or not...like...when i download and a torrent finishes, i can leave
it open, but, even when it's minimized, it's still sitting in my winders task bar. i want something
that will allow me to leave it open and possibly leave some other things open too, and it will just
collect them all inside the one app and not have 42 million items in my taskbar...

i'm all about the feng shuei desktop.

any help is greatly appreciated.

Subject: {pb-cle} Butterfly Dance Ritual Thanks

Thanks to all who made it to the
Eagle's nest Saturday. You can say
what you want about that place, but
it has proven over time to be the biggest,
cleanest, safest, most reliable venue this
area has to offer. The drawback is the
20-30 minute drive from Cleveland. The
crowd was made up of mostly out of state
heads. We had a few pb-cle reps, but it
was mostly new faces which is encouraging.

I was blown away by the blending of the deco by
Devotee, Visuals by Geekboy/TFC, and the
music which all blended together to create
a unique atmosphere. Cosmic traveler sound is
all that. 4 pieces but still had the nest
shakin.

Working back...

My boy Jason, The Funk Detective played the
dopest set I have ever heard him drop and
that's saying alot. He really played to the
crowd and adapted his music to that of a
trance gathering. Techno all the way, but
kept the trance head interested. Heike from
Magnetrixx said She was really gettin down to
the Funk Detective sound.


Magnetrixx - Like Trout said. "They were off
the fucking hook". If you missed it..well, I
can't do nothin for ya. You might have to
fly to Europe to catch that noise. They played
alot of soon to be released material.

KRI - I didn't get to hear him as much as I
wanted to. Promotional duties called. What I
did hear was hard and psychedelic and extremely
full on!

UZI - Our Russian import. One of the few psy dj's
who still uses vinyl. He got the psy drum beating
and really brought alot of energy to the party.

The Break Beat Milita - There's a reason why I booked
the BBM for the trance gathering. Cuz they are the
BBM! Nuff said. It's ALWAYS a good idea to have
Clevr, Moose, and Zone at your party. They B rawkin it
propa!

So..we will do this again sometime. Thanks.

Bom,
Luke/Dj Malachi

Shadow's Experimental has a "minimize to tray" option.

That's the best I can think of.

Subject: {pb-cle} INFECTED MUSHROOM - LIVE!  5-14 DC

5.14.04 Buzzlife Productions + Konvocation present

 INFECTED MUSHROOM - LIVE!

 Washington, DC @ Club Nation

 Buzzlife Productions & Konvocation, two of the most contemporary electroni=
c music
promotional companies on the east coast, join forces to bring you a musical=

extravaganza that will not be forgotten. The flavor of the night is psytran=
 ce, a
powerful new genre forged at the all night beach parties of Goa, India.

 Psytrance is a fresh incarnation of electronic dance music with a complex =
texture of
psychedelic sounds woven into a kaleidoscopic tapestry. Psytrance songs ten=
 d to be
symphonic, complete pieces of music unlike most forms of simpler dance musi=
 c. The
music is complex and compelling, with key changes, different time signature=
 s and
tempos. The songs are layered over a heavy 4/4 kick drum and high hat that =
 is often
buried in layers of analog sounds and synthesizers.

 Unlike most nightclub events, where fast-moving lights and fog machines ar=
e the
only atmospherics, Psytrance parties are living art shows, characterized by=
 high-
wattage UV (black) lights, intricately painted UV reactive banners and 3-di=
 mensional
fluorescent sculpture and decor. The combined aural and visual environment =
 is
involving, nearly impossible to verbalize; an atmosphere which must be expe=
 rienced
to be understood.

 This is one event you must not miss.

 The psytrance starts outside at 9pm under the stars in full view of Washin=
gton, DC's
Capitol building on the multilevel patio. Dj Icey will be warming up the ma=
 in room.
Then, around 1:00 am, psytrance will also take over the main room with Infe=
 cted
Mushroom performing live and Cyzum following with an exclusive DJ set.

 Psytrance performers:

 INFECTED MUSHROOM - LIVE!
 BNE Records | Israel (www.infected.co.il)
 Infected Mushroom are Erez Eizen and Amit Duvdevani (nicknamed Duvdev). Th=
is
duo from Israel has rocked the trance world repeatedly with their release o=
 f each
album. Their debut album, "Gathering" occupies a place in the "most played =
 trance
albums" list and is the perfect starting point for any new hard psytrance. =
 With the
album "BP Empire," they improvised a new soundscape and showed why they are=

among the top trance acts ever. With the recent release of "Converting Vege=
 tarians",
this Israeli duo go a few steps beyond the standard and produce not only cl=
 assical
pieces but also a harsh, funky, and acidic flavor, making their trance jour=
 ney and
aural blast far surpassing the norm. Their world travels rarely pass throug=
 h America,
so be sure not to miss this rare opportunity to experience two of the maste=
 rs of
electronic music.

 CYZUM - Konvocation | MD (www.konvocation.com)
 Resident DJ for Konvocation in Baltimore and rapidly becoming one of the p=
remiere
psytrance DJs in America. Cyzum's set will be accompanied by K. Cornelius o=
 n tribal
percussion and Mind Warped on the digital effects.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Warhol - one night of electro-trash 4/16/04

Hello two weeks ago.

I just got Avenue D's CD "Bootleg" in the mail the other day.  There are
about 7 tracks and they are all pretty funny lyrically but the vocals
are recorded like shit.  I bet the tracks themselves (not their live
performance) would sound terrible on a big system.  The music is a
little pedestrian but fun.  I bet with some work on the quality and
tweaking the lyrics they could have a real gem on their hands.

How was the show?  I couldn't make it.

Yeah, it comes with an old-school-styled media player, which is handy.


> oh, and does this play ALL generations of Real media files?


I haven't come across one it hasn't been able to play, as far as I can 
remember.

I watch most of my vids (movies, tv, music videos, etc) in that media 
player as well, its small and fast.  It occassionally has a problem 
(slowing down, choppy) with some movies, but not often.

Trevor Lamont - Lexington, KY. - www.trevorlamont.com

aka Trevor Lamont Wilson hails from the great east coast. Born in New
Jersey and schooled in the majestic house vibes in Philly. He caught the
house bug while in school at Temple University. Philadelphia had and still
has a great house club scene and with New York close by his education was
in good hands. He spent lots of time in the various clubs learning about
the sounds of house from the likes of King Britt, Josh Wink, Tony
Humphies, Lil Louie Vega, and Frankie Knuckles. Eventually he got his own
tables and decided to take that step on the other side of the table.
Through years of decication and practice to his form he has made himself
into a very accomplished house D.J. Trevor has traveled all over sharing
his unique style of mixing house. His style is very mix intensive. If you
watch him you'll notice that he's constantly in the mix and that helps to
bring about nice textured and thick sounds. He is all about flow. His sets
are usually very sexy and deep. He can pump it up though and has been know
to drop the occasional surprise techno sets.

there is also a quicktime alternative.   these packages are just the

most every codec you'll ever need except real and quicktime.

Subject: {pb-cle} Kemistry R.I.P./Hive top 10

http://www.breakbeat.co.uk/news/
27 April 2004

Sunday 25th April 2004 was 5 years to the day that Kemistry sadly passed
away.

Born Kemi Olusanya in Birmingham, Kemistry was one of the most recognized
and established women DJs in drum & bass. Moving to London via Sheffield,
she embraced the rave scene with Storm before meeting Goldie.

Together they started the eponymous Metalheadz imprint, with Kemistry &
Storm running things for Goldie while continuing their DJ careers. In 1999
Kemistry and Storm released their debut mix album in the reputed Studio
K7!'s DJ Kicks series. The same year a tragic freak accident killed the
young DJ when she was being driven home by Storm. The accident was a shock
and great loss for the whole electronic music world.

DJ Storm contacted us to pay tribute to her friend, 'It has been 5 years
since Kemistry departed this earthly plane. From that moment there has not
been a day that has gone by that she has not been in my thoughts. When I
feel down about her loss, I remember how much joy she got from being a DJ
and playing Drum & Bass; it made us both so happy and that thought has kept
me going. Her warm genuine smile that could light up a whole room, her
amazing wisdom and for both of us laughing in the face of adversity... trust
me when I say these thoughts of her are always with me!

'Kemistry my soul Sista' - May her memory live in our hearts forever.'
DJ Kemistry RIP

I know a few people from this list took interest in ARC
(www.arcspace.net) in New York City...Their closing weekend was Sat/Sun.
 
The building they were in was bought by a developer who will turn it
into condos. The last big bash with Danny Tenaglia and Bill Patrick of
the 112 crew was on Sunday.
 
Rumor has it they're opening a new place somewhere in the meatpacking
district near Filter 14, but I have absolutely no idea if this rumor is
based on any fact.
 
Arc Resident Bill Patrick played some of the best, filthy, dirty
f*cked-up techno and tech-house I have ever heard ... I hope wherever
Danny Tenaglia lands next he will take Bill P and the 112 crew with him.
 
Also, another scene staple, Centro-Fly, is closing...reportedly because
"the wives had had enough..."

isnt arc where they had the NASA reunion party?

i heard db took a $10,000 loss cuz of some shady shit by the promoter and to 
a lesser extent the space where they had the party(the ppl that owned the 
space are only tied up in it cuz of legalities)


anyways...lots of clubs are closing everywhere....i think the rave "bubble" 
has offically popped.

2004 HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 1
FRIDAY, MAY 21
NOEL SANGER (noelsanger.com, gravity music group, nettwerk)

Noel Sanger has produced over 100 releases on 30 labels during the past
10 years. He has made five mixed CDs which have sold hundreds of
thousands of copies. Who is Noel Sanger?
 
At age 8, he wrote his first songs; at age 13, he picked up his first
guitar; in high school he studied music theory, jazz, and classical
music. In 1990, he converted to the religion of house and techno while
working as a presenter at a Naples, FL, dance music radio station. From
there he began DJing and producing, building a small but devoted
following for underground music in the tourist town that he called home.
By late 1994, he felt it was time to move on, and he set up shop in
Miami.
 
Over the next several years, Sanger experimented with techno, New York
house, and Florida breakbeats. During these years, he drew from many
genres of music, forming and fusing these styles into what is now known
as "progressive."
 
"To me," Noel says, "Progressive doesn't necessarily mean a specific
sound; it's the attitude, the mentality of the music moving forward," he
says. "I think that a good progressive DJ can play from many different
genres." 
 
His five nationally released DJ mixes have all met with enthusiastic
critical acclaim; the most recent of those, "Summerbreeze 2" (Nettwerk).
 
Now with Gravity Music Group, Noel Sanger tours the globe, moving dance
floors from Tokyo to South America. 2004 sees Noel working in
collaboration with Electrofly and Luke Chable.
 
Join us in welcoming Noel to Cleveland for this very special kickoff to
the 2004 HeadRush Music Summer Series!

Subject: {pb-cle} DJs in the Cleveland Area

Does anyone know anyone (or a few anyones) who would be 
willing to spin in an area equivalent to a small apartment, 
for a bunch of people they don't even know, for little or no 
money some time between May 17 and 19? Because I sure don't, 
but I wish I did. 

All "yeah, I know someone..." emails could be sent to my 
email address personally if you'd like. All "are you an 
idiot?..." responses could just be sent to the whole list 
for everyone to enjoy. Thanks.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} LTJ Bukem Sat @ Moda

lets be honest here. i was playing atmospheric drum and bass 6 
years ago and no one cared. when i gave up the shit 4 years ago 
still no one cared. when adam ratana plays it now, no one cares. 
so how many people in the city might show up? 50? fuck that 
nonsense. anyone who makes good drum and bass should stay as far 
away from here as they can. if mullets and heavy metal is their 
thing, this is fucking paradise.

Well, think about it, we had some broken beat house, some hip hop, 
some 80's, some disco, some house, some techno, some soul, and 
there were drunk people abounding at the end of the night.  

Thanks jason for having us!

Everyone else, come out sunday to Bikki for the tom cox 
experience...

Subject: {pb-cle} Kelly's

I was talking to a friend yesterday, on a groggy early-morning busride, 
and we got on the subject of Kelly's on the East End. He said that the
person organizing the event is very specific of what is played on Tuesday
(I think) nights. He said he spun there recently and was told he could not
play any Hip Hop or DnB. I believe he said he was told to play House and
Classic Garage prior to 1977. The description and the year don't fit for
me, so I must have heard something wrong. Can someone please enlighten me
as to what the deal is? Thanks.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kelly's

Tuesday night at Kelly's is Funk and Soul night.
Classic Garage? ahhh I don't think so. Everything pre
1977 sounds about right.

Its not an Electronic music night.  There is no Dnb,
no Techno, no trance.  Just old classics.  I mean OLD.
 Funk and Soul old, Bill Cosby old, Good Ole Stevie
Wonder Old, Bill Withers Old. Artists I don't know but
the music is so good, old.

AND its probably one of the best nights during the
week to go out. Not probably, it is. Megan, owner of
720 records in East Liberty runs the night.  Its free,
check it out some time!

Hope that helps.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kelly's

tuesday nights is funk soul disco jazz reggae or even some funky 
rock, with the general requirement that it be pre 77. hiphop and 
drum and bass are definitely out of the question. i even got 
beefed at once for playing some 80s depeche mode, but i got over 
it. house really isnt allowed either, i dont know why they would 
have said that. who was this that made the comment?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kelly's

I was wondering who made the comment also.  That
description was so odd it didn't make much sense for
what is actually played there. I mean if the guy has
been there at least once, how he came up with that
description is kinda mind boggling.

And not only that but dood said he spun there once
before?  Not too many new heads work their way into
that line up that often.  Then again I haven't been
out in a few weeks.

Do tell! :)

Disclaimer:

As I mentioned before... this was a bleary-eyed, WAY overindulged in the
vodka/redbulls, and got home at 3:30am, on the bus at 7:30am kinda morning
that day.

This miscommunication is most assuredly completely my fault, so I don't
want this to ever come across as the guy being loaded up with the bull
jive.

why would he want to play hiphop or drum and bass? i missed that 
night but i ran into him earlier that day and dug through his bag 
or records for that night. he was playing lots of philadelphia 
international records, some barry white, some james brown, etc. he 
seemed pretty amped about getting to play those records. 

someone was on the crack rocks during this conversation of yours

i did like that "alive" track. it cannot be overestimated, 
however, how much i hate hello nasty. what a horrible horrible 
record. ill give them a chance because ive liked them since i was 
6, but my hopes are not high.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Kelly's

He never said that he wanted to play those styles there. He was talking
about the night and was just running down the *rules* that they have
established for the format.

It was strictly a description of what they didn't want there.

I was actually smoking rocks while having the conversation. Probably just
misheard him when I inhaled that piece of Choreboy!

*Pokes self in eye for approaching this thread in a bass-ackwards manner*

No sense in coverting rm to mp3 anyway, all you are doing is wasting hard
