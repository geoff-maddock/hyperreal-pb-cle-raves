Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Sat Jul 19                    CHRISTMAS IN JULY                  Pittsburgh

July 19th, 2008

Pittsburgh PA
B.A.D. Ass. & Sinister Movement welcome you to.
Christmas in July!

Featuring...


Josh the Funky 1
(EV Inc., System Recordings, Funktion Recordings)
Chicago IL

Josh The Funky 1 hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A
DJ for over a decade his style covers the gamut of House, from Uplifting 
Vocals to Dirty Tech.... Pumpin Big-room to Jacking Chicago....its 
representative of the influences and fusions heard around the world in 
modern House Music. Ever the performer, .The Funky 1. has become 
synonymous with using scratching, loops, acapellas, & effects, while 
also playing on three CDJ decks, allowing for an unparallel level of 
creativity in his live sets.
Coming from a city so deeply rooted in House Music, it was interestingly 
enough hip-hop and the sub-culture around it that initially sparked his 
interest to pursue a career in the DJ world. Buying a pair of decks 
while still in grade school, Josh discovered the art of scratching and 
was instantly mesmerized. His passion and persistence for the art form 
proved to be worthwhile, as he has since become a D.M.C. Midwest 
Finalist and a winner of the W.M.C.- D.J. Spin-Off Battle. His first 
exposure to house music came through Chicago radio station B96 (96.3 
fm), where every Friday and Saturday night he locked into the sounds of 
DJ.s Julian .jumpin. Perez and Bad Boy Bill. It.s only naturally fitting 
then that in 2001 Josh The Funky 1 was hired to became a weekly resident 
on the exact same Mix Show that initially hooked him in. Nowadays you 
can find Josh at the forefront of digital era, with his own Radio 
Podcast on I-tunes, allowing him to go beyond the Chicago airwaves and 
reach a global audience of listeners.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Jul 19                    CHRISTMAS IN JULY                  Pittsburgh

July 19th, 2008

Pittsburgh PA
B.A.D. Ass. & Sinister Movement welcome you to.
Christmas in July!

Featuring...


Josh the Funky 1
(EV Inc., System Recordings, Funktion Recordings)
Chicago IL

Josh The Funky 1 hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A
DJ for over a decade his style covers the gamut of House, from Uplifting 
Vocals to Dirty Tech.... Pumpin Big-room to Jacking Chicago....its 
representative of the influences and fusions heard around the world in 
modern House Music. Ever the performer, .The Funky 1. has become 
synonymous with using scratching, loops, acapellas, & effects, while 
also playing on three CDJ decks, allowing for an unparallel level of 
creativity in his live sets.
Coming from a city so deeply rooted in House Music, it was interestingly 
enough hip-hop and the sub-culture around it that initially sparked his 
interest to pursue a career in the DJ world. Buying a pair of decks 
while still in grade school, Josh discovered the art of scratching and 
was instantly mesmerized. His passion and persistence for the art form 
proved to be worthwhile, as he has since become a D.M.C. Midwest 
Finalist and a winner of the W.M.C.- D.J. Spin-Off Battle. His first 
exposure to house music came through Chicago radio station B96 (96.3 
fm), where every Friday and Saturday night he locked into the sounds of 
DJ.s Julian .jumpin. Perez and Bad Boy Bill. It.s only naturally fitting 
then that in 2001 Josh The Funky 1 was hired to became a weekly resident 
on the exact same Mix Show that initially hooked him in. Nowadays you 
can find Josh at the forefront of digital era, with his own Radio 
Podcast on I-tunes, allowing him to go beyond the Chicago airwaves and 
reach a global audience of listeners.

Regardless of how anyone feels about DSL, a strange phenomenon tends
to occur for these shows where everyone crawls out of the woodwork and
heads to the bbt, so that's usually a nice thing.

We are working on some other shows for the rest of the year hopefully
it will please those looking for something a little different...

i always viewed dieselboy as a 'reunion' type event where if i wanted to
catch up with some old heads, except the haters, then i'd go.  i was
disappointed i was unable to make it out this week.

looking forward to the announcements of those other shows...

Yeah, I guess Im a hater for not liking dslbutt. Lets face it. There's only
one real reason why this guy is booked anymore...  Its not because he's a
good dj either.

It's not like the "old heads" are ever around to support what good acts did
come thru anyways.  Kind of ass backwards to me, but okay.

Subject: {pb-cle} jeremy bible & jason henry - vryashn - new album now available

Hello friends,
Wanted to share the news of a new album by myself and friend Jason
that we are very excited about and think many of you would enjoy.

Our new album 'Vryashn' is out now and available from the fantastic
record label Gears of Sand. Alternatively you can get details/samples
from cdbaby.
http://www.gearsofsand.net/home.html
http://cdbaby.com/cd/biblehenry

"This two track opus is a truly epic immersion into the vast
imaginations of Bible and Henry. The confident, effortless development
of broken piano treatment at Vryashn's epicenter bring to mind the
sublime energy of Harold Budd and Brian Eno. The unique talents of the
constantly evolving Bible and Henry are on full display with Vryashn.
For one, the well honed laptopist duo turn here to piano as their main
medium.

While the warmth, spacious piano movements of ambient pioneers Harold
Budd and Brian Eno is often drawn upon for inspiration by other
artists, few are able to use the instrument in ways heard on Vryashn.

Rather than sparse notes played between silences, Bible and Henry use
the piano as a launching pad into a sprawling world of minimal piano
motifs that build tension and release given a depth through subtle
laptop treatments.

Vryashn is arguably a definitive statement of Bible and Henry's
talents as composers on the cutting edge of an overflowing and
arguably oversampled electronic scene.

Beyond synthetic 'soundscapes' or 'interesting textures' Vryashn
coalesces into an extraordinarily epic journey.

Unfolding over two movements clocking in at just over 50 minutes, the
work's addictive minimalist motifs pull the listener in only to be
washed over--often unexpectedly--by subtle sonorities of breathy
fibrillations, pulsing machinery, and radiant drones that intrigue but
never serve to take Vryashn off its massive, radiant course. In a
word, breathtaking."

BTW....You can see us perform at the Ingenuity Festival in Cleveland
the night of Saturday July 26th.
http://www.ingenuitycleveland.com/
And if your looking for a weekend of fantastic music & seminars you
can see us at Electro-Music 2008 in Kingsport, TN.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

July 19th, 2008

Pittsburgh PA
B.A.D. Ass. & Sinister Movement welcome you to.
Christmas in July!

Featuring...


Josh the Funky 1
(EV Inc., System Recordings, Funktion Recordings)
Chicago IL

Josh The Funky 1 hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A
DJ for over a decade his style covers the gamut of House, from Uplifting 
Vocals to Dirty Tech.... Pumpin Big-room to Jacking Chicago....its 
representative of the influences and fusions heard around the world in 
modern House Music. Ever the performer, .The Funky 1. has become 
synonymous with using scratching, loops, acapellas, & effects, while 
also playing on three CDJ decks, allowing for an unparallel level of 
creativity in his live sets.
Coming from a city so deeply rooted in House Music, it was interestingly 
enough hip-hop and the sub-culture around it that initially sparked his 
interest to pursue a career in the DJ world. Buying a pair of decks 
while still in grade school, Josh discovered the art of scratching and 
was instantly mesmerized. His passion and persistence for the art form 
proved to be worthwhile, as he has since become a D.M.C. Midwest 
Finalist and a winner of the W.M.C.- D.J. Spin-Off Battle. His first 
exposure to house music came through Chicago radio station B96 (96.3 
fm), where every Friday and Saturday night he locked into the sounds of 
DJ.s Julian .jumpin. Perez and Bad Boy Bill. It.s only naturally fitting 
then that in 2001 Josh The Funky 1 was hired to became a weekly resident 
on the exact same Mix Show that initially hooked him in. Nowadays you 
can find Josh at the forefront of digital era, with his own Radio 
Podcast on I-tunes, allowing him to go beyond the Chicago airwaves and 
reach a global audience of listeners.

Thu Aug 28                    Infected Mushroom                   Cleveland

[i love it! a "LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE"]

LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE!!!
Date: 8/28/08
Time: Doors open at 9pm sharp
Venue: Metropolis 2325 Elm St Cleveland OH. 44113
Ages: 18 to enter, 21 to drink
Cost: $25 Advance (Limited Number Available)
http://www.wantickets.com?e_id=43273
$30 before 10pm @ door; $35 there after


Israel-bred, LA-based psy-trance duo INFECTED MUSHROOM--Amit .Duvdev. 
Duvedevani and Erez Eisen--have been playing to increasingly massive, 
frenzied crowds all over the globe (over 135 shows in 2007 alone), 
thanks to an explosive live show that.s far cry from the staid 
stereotype of dance acts hunched over their laptops and turntables. This 
year Infected Mushroom.s big plans encompass numerous tour dates 
throughout the U.S. and major studio time working on their seventh 
album, due out this summer.

Infected Mushroom will kick off their 2008 tour dates March 13 in 
Austin, TX during SXSW. Joining Duvdev (vocals) and Erez (keyboards) are 
tour guitarist Tommy Cunningham and Brazilian drummer Rogerio Jardim. 
Here the industry will be able to check out a live performance of 
material from Infected Mushroom.s upcoming album and experience 
first-hand why such major festivals as Coachella, Vegoose, Miami.s Ultra 
Music Festival, San Diego Street Scene, L.A..s Monster Massive, Virgin 
Festival in Baltimore, Camp Bisco and Sao Paulo.s Tribe have highlighted 
them on their stages. Other markets Infected Mushroom is confirmed to 
perform in this year include Houston, Dallas, Boulder, Miami, Denver and 
Los Angeles.

2007 was a landmark year for one of electronica.s biggest bands. Besides 
all the aforementioned festival dates plus a headlining slot for over 
500,000 people (last New Years Eve in Rio De Janeiro, with the Black 
Eyed Peas and John Legend), they now rank #9 Overall and the #1 
Psy-Trance Artist Worldwide on DJ Magazine.s prestigious Top 100 DJ 
Poll. The band have moved to Los Angeles to get serious in the studio 
and began working on the follow-up to their album Vicious Delicious.

As told to Allan McGrath of DJ:

.In the last year we.ve come out of the psy-trance bracket, which is 
where we want to go,. Duvdev explains. .We.ve been playing rock venues, 
which we.re happy about as we never wanted to be categorized.. .We.re 
happy that people come and see Infected Mushroom even if they aren.t 
into psy-trance,. adds Erez. .We.re always looking to things we haven.t 
tried before.. Fans of their classic psy-trance pulse need not be too 
concerned though. Already, two of the tracks laid down for their next LP 
are ferocious psy-trancers . with recent tracks .Sayid. and .Nine 
Percent. instigating a full-on reception in their recent live shows. 
.There.s another track called .Black Shwarma. which blends cool lyrics 
with distorted heavy metal guitars,. adds Duvdev..

Sat Sep 20                 STEPPING INTO DARKNESS                Cincinnati

Royal Dubs Presents:
Stepping Into Darkness
September 20, 2008

Cyrus from Random Trio . Dubstep . London, UK - RTP, Tectonic
http://www.myspace.com/randomtrio, randomtrioproductions.com

One of the early pioneering DJ/producers of the sound we now call 
Dubstep, Cyrus from Random Trio 1st began his dj career back in 1998 as 
a ukg Dj. After just 3 months of mixing Cyrus was given his 1st chance 
to play for a local promotion in Croydon, shortly after he was offered a 
residency and never looked back. Various pirate radio shows followed 
along with more bookings for local clubs in & around London. The summer 
of 99 saw Cyrus take his dj'ing to the island of Corfu (Kavos). In this 
time Cyrus had met and became good friends with fellow Random Trio 
member Omni, and by 2000 were doing most of their dj sets together. They 
1st formed a little crew in 2001 consisting of themselves & 3 mc's and 
soon gained a good following. They built their 1st track by the end of 
the year and had heard interest from a major label. However before this 
took place they split going there own separate ways. Cyrus and Omni 
carried on dj'ing together and decided to carry on making beats for 
their radio shows. It was around this time they 1st heard Horsepower 
Productions and were taken aback by their unique style. They found the 
sound they were looking for. By 2003 Cyrus had made a batch of tunes and 
brought out his 1st release on their imprint RTP. This was the Lost City 
EP. January 2004 saw Cyrus with his own show on London's biggest pirate 
Rinse.fm.. One of the early nights was a night put on by DMZ called dub 
sessions held on a Sunday at black sheep bar in Croydon. With a newer 
member, Omen, Random trio have a number of successful releases and more 
recently Cyrus's From the Shadows LP. Random trio have played at clubs 
all over the world from Finland to California and look forward to the 
future.

Subject: {pb-cle} Greetings from the land of the incarcerated!

Good God, I haven't been online since the beginning of May!

I'm typing this note from The Job Center on Tallmadge Ave in Akron, where
I have specific permission to look for jobs online. I have to report back
to the fabulous women's Community Based Correctional Facility (CBCF) by
2:45. Hee-friggin'-haw.

I'm done with this bullshit in 5 weeks; I start coming home every weekend
starting this Saturday.

I miss all of you guys!

This place doesn't let me get on Myspace, which is killing me because I
know I have tons of new messages and comments, but I can wait until
Saturday to check that if I have time.

Henry, congrats on the new house! Brian, congrats on the new job!

Love,

Amanda

P.S. - Thanks to all of you who have written to me! If anyone else cares
to drop me a note (which I would loveto receive), send it to Amanda Yesko,
CSCBCF Program, 941 Sherman St., Akron, OH 44311

P.P.S. - I'm not a rat and am serving my time: how's my street cred?
Pretty damn good, I'd say.

Heard a thing on Sound Opinions today about him and "Girl Talk" and  
was curious if he used to go to the parties...

As in Raves....no I dont think you would find him at many of those.
Youd be more likely to find him at more experimental/leftfield
shows....like at the old and greatly missed Speak In Tongues. He
played many events in Cleveland and Akron including many of our
Experimedia events back in the early 00s.

Subject: {pb-cle} experimedia: two new cd releases

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
jeremy bible & jason henry - vector [expcd003]
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Vector, the new album by Jeremy Bible & Jason Henry, presents an epic
1 hour and 7 minute avant-garde sound experience. Vector unfolds
through the amalgamation of a vivid palette of sounds placed
delicately on a worn canvas, burnt and tattered around the edges.
Piano and cello seep through soft blankets of distant voices, rhythmic
crackling, and soft distortions. A thousand birds arise from pulsing
tones against the occasional rumbling sine wave. A profound score from
beginning to end intended for deep listening.

Vector comes packaged in experimedia's custom signature three panel
folding tall slim pack featuring the photography of Jeremy Bibleand is
protected in a clear poly sleeve.

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
asymmetrical head - feeling sorry for inanimate objects [expcd004]
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Experimedia presents the new album by Asymmetrical Head....Feeling
Sorry For Inanimate Objects. FSFIO is the product of a broad range of
stylistic influences ingeniously fused together into a primarily
rhythmic based abstract electronic album. Head nodding dancehall
rhythms lead into disjointed electro rhythms for double jointed
breakdancers. Cutup melodies and expertly designed effects.
Atmospheric ambience and noise. Dubstep style bass accompanied by
processed viola. Subtle touches of ethereal female vocals. Puddle
splashing pop and lock fills. A fantastically crafted and original
album.

Feeling Sorry For Inanimate Objects comes packaged in experimedia's
custom signature three panel folding tall slim pack and is protected
in a clear poly sleeve.

http://www.experimedia.net/

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
Your order of these limited edition packaged CDs includes immediate
bonus downloads of the album in highest quality MP3 and/or lossless
FLAC formats so that you may begin to enjoy the album before your
package arrives. Download only sales of the full album in FLAC or MP3
will be available exclusively through experimedia for $5 approximately
one month after the CD release. This release will proudly NOT be
available on iTunes.

NOW AVAILABLE FOR ORDER AND MORE INFO AT

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} at Ingeuity Fest in Cleveland Saturday 11pm

Wanted to mention there are some other really cool performances,
installations, and exhibits taking place as well.

Crooked River, in 1st and 3rd Persons by
Spurse with collaborators David Jensenius
and Sean White, New York, N.Y.
Presented by Flats Oxbow Association
Ongoing: Various festival stations
Tune in to the sonic path of the Cuyahoga River as it
courses through the urban grid of Cleveland. Eavesdrop
at live listening posts along the river to hear
something unexpected. Engage with multiple histories
of the river as you trace its flows through time.
http://www.crookedriversonglines.org/index.html

Live Infringement: The Thimbletron by
Evolution Control Committee, San Francisco, Calif.
Presented by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum
Friday: All Go Signs Stage
Saturday, 2:30 p.m.: Hanna Stage
Sunday: All Go Signs Stage
Mad geniuses or copyright criminals? For more than 20
years, The Evolution Control Committee has been making
musical copyright violations, playing their custom-built
Thimbletron and polishing their own music genre ("Mashup")
with a reputation for party-science performances that
are not to be missed!

Inventions Suite by Toenjes-Marchant-Smith,
Urbana, Ill.
Friday, 9 p.m.: Ohio Theatre
Saturday, 6 p.m.: Ohio Theatre
A magical theatrical experience inspired by the question of
the artist's connection to technology and man's connection to
machine! Inventions Suite is a 60-minute interactive work that
explores (through a cyclical combination of video activated
by music, music prompted by movement, and new improvised
responses by both dancer and musician) the advent of
computer-interface dance and the challenges and inspiration it
sparks in these improvised dance/music performances.

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Aug 09                      PLASTIC CITY                     Pittsburgh

Terry Lee Brown Jr., legendary house producer and DJ, is making a 
supremely rare stop in Pittsburgh to give us a special night to remind 
us why we love house music.

Humanaut is extremely proud to present:
Terry Lee Brown Jr
Plastic City - Frankfurt, Germany
Saturday, August 9th @ Moto

For years Terry Lee Brown Jr. has been considered as a member of the 
international elite of House producers, and like no other, he has 
developed the subgenre Tech-House. In the USA and England his first two 
albums became successes of note and the media got a surprise when they 
found out Mr. Brown is actually a German.

Terry Lee Brown Jr, alias Norman Feller, began DJing in 1989 and soon 
thereafter released his first tracks on vinyl under various pseudonyms. 
1994 was the turning point for Norman when he decided to dedicate 
himself totally to music In the following year he invented the 
house-oriented project (alter-ego) Terry Lee Brown Jr. which allowed him 
to create his own sound. Plastic City, which was at that time still a 
very young label, offered Terry an outlet for his music and he has 
stayed true to this label ever since.

After the success of his first 12" releases came his debut Album Brother 
For Real in spring of 1996. This release was a true milestone for 
Tech-House and incorporated elements of Jungle, Trance and Easy 
Listening. The public response to Brother For Real was gigantic, and not 
limited to scenesters. Muzik (12/96), England's most respected dance 
music magazine chose Brother For Real as one of the top ten albums of 
1996 (along with albums from artists like DJ Shadow, Fugees, Underworld 
and Faithless). Marshall Jefferson, the Chicago House legend, honored 
Terry in an album review by simply stating "He is God" (Raveline 
11/1996).

In fall of 1997 Terry's second album Chocolate Chords garnered further 
praise and matched the success of Bother For Real. In America Mixmag 
chose this second effort as one of the top 5 albums of the year.

Terry Lee Brown Jr. is not only a respected producer, but also a much 
sought-after DJ. This side of the artist is apparent when one listens to 
the compilation series Terry's Cafe 1-5. These mixed CDs once again 
found resonance in the music press and received rave reviews from Muzik, 
Urb, XLR8R and other national and international magazines. But the story 
doesn't end there. Remixes from TLB Jr. of such artists as Gabrielle 
(Rise), Nalin & Kane (Talkin' About), Louise (Let's Go Round Again), 
Paul Van Dyk (For An Angel), Paris Red (Love Hurts), and Future Funk 
(Music Takes You High) secured his reputation as a true Remix-Artist.

The third and latest album From Dub Til Dawn is a product of two years 
work and continues the tradition of Terry's genre-bending House-sound. 
>From Dub Til Dawn brings together bass-heavy housegrooves with warm 
atmospheric planes and fragmented vocals. Sound and rhythm are the most 
important in this case. Fusions of House and Dub or Two-Step round out 
the album. Pay attention to the track Take Your Time, which Terry 
produced in cooperation with his friend and label-mate Timewriter.

Today Terry Lee Brown Junior is one of the most happening and respected 
House Artists around. This is probably due to the passion and love he 
invests in his uncompromising productions and mix sets. His albums and 
mix CDs have shown the world that House music not only works on the 
dancefloor, but also in a comfy chair.

Opening duties by: Pittsburgh house music icon : Brother Mike (DC Space)

Thu Aug 28                    Infected Mushroom                   Cleveland

[i love it! a "LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE"]

LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE!!!
Date: 8/28/08
Time: Doors open at 9pm sharp
Venue: Metropolis 2325 Elm St Cleveland OH. 44113
Ages: 18 to enter, 21 to drink
Cost: $25 Advance (Limited Number Available)
http://www.wantickets.com?e_id=43273
$30 before 10pm @ door; $35 there after


Israel-bred, LA-based psy-trance duo INFECTED MUSHROOM--Amit .Duvdev. 
Duvedevani and Erez Eisen--have been playing to increasingly massive, 
frenzied crowds all over the globe (over 135 shows in 2007 alone), 
thanks to an explosive live show that.s far cry from the staid 
stereotype of dance acts hunched over their laptops and turntables. This 
year Infected Mushroom.s big plans encompass numerous tour dates 
throughout the U.S. and major studio time working on their seventh 
album, due out this summer.

Infected Mushroom will kick off their 2008 tour dates March 13 in 
Austin, TX during SXSW. Joining Duvdev (vocals) and Erez (keyboards) are 
tour guitarist Tommy Cunningham and Brazilian drummer Rogerio Jardim. 
Here the industry will be able to check out a live performance of 
material from Infected Mushroom.s upcoming album and experience 
first-hand why such major festivals as Coachella, Vegoose, Miami.s Ultra 
Music Festival, San Diego Street Scene, L.A..s Monster Massive, Virgin 
Festival in Baltimore, Camp Bisco and Sao Paulo.s Tribe have highlighted 
them on their stages. Other markets Infected Mushroom is confirmed to 
perform in this year include Houston, Dallas, Boulder, Miami, Denver and 
Los Angeles.

2007 was a landmark year for one of electronica.s biggest bands. Besides 
all the aforementioned festival dates plus a headlining slot for over 
500,000 people (last New Years Eve in Rio De Janeiro, with the Black 
Eyed Peas and John Legend), they now rank #9 Overall and the #1 
Psy-Trance Artist Worldwide on DJ Magazine.s prestigious Top 100 DJ 
Poll. The band have moved to Los Angeles to get serious in the studio 
and began working on the follow-up to their album Vicious Delicious.

As told to Allan McGrath of DJ:

.In the last year we.ve come out of the psy-trance bracket, which is 
where we want to go,. Duvdev explains. .We.ve been playing rock venues, 
which we.re happy about as we never wanted to be categorized.. .We.re 
happy that people come and see Infected Mushroom even if they aren.t 
into psy-trance,. adds Erez. .We.re always looking to things we haven.t 
tried before.. Fans of their classic psy-trance pulse need not be too 
concerned though. Already, two of the tracks laid down for their next LP 
are ferocious psy-trancers . with recent tracks .Sayid. and .Nine 
Percent. instigating a full-on reception in their recent live shows. 
.There.s another track called .Black Shwarma. which blends cool lyrics 
with distorted heavy metal guitars,. adds Duvdev..

September 20, 2008

Cyrus from Random Trio . Dubstep . London, UK - RTP, Tectonic
http://www.myspace.com/randomtrio, randomtrioproductions.com

One of the early pioneering DJ/producers of the sound we now call 
Dubstep, Cyrus from Random Trio 1st began his dj career back in 1998 as 
a ukg Dj. After just 3 months of mixing Cyrus was given his 1st chance 
to play for a local promotion in Croydon, shortly after he was offered a 
residency and never looked back. Various pirate radio shows followed 
along with more bookings for local clubs in & around London. The summer 
of 99 saw Cyrus take his dj'ing to the island of Corfu (Kavos). In this 
time Cyrus had met and became good friends with fellow Random Trio 
member Omni, and by 2000 were doing most of their dj sets together. They 
1st formed a little crew in 2001 consisting of themselves & 3 mc's and 
soon gained a good following. They built their 1st track by the end of 
the year and had heard interest from a major label. However before this 
took place they split going there own separate ways. Cyrus and Omni 
carried on dj'ing together and decided to carry on making beats for 
their radio shows. It was around this time they 1st heard Horsepower 
Productions and were taken aback by their unique style. They found the 
sound they were looking for. By 2003 Cyrus had made a batch of tunes and 
brought out his 1st release on their imprint RTP. This was the Lost City 
EP. January 2004 saw Cyrus with his own show on London's biggest pirate 
Rinse.fm.. One of the early nights was a night put on by DMZ called dub 
sessions held on a Sunday at black sheep bar in Croydon. With a newer 
member, Omen, Random trio have a number of successful releases and more 
recently Cyrus's From the Shadows LP. Random trio have played at clubs 
all over the world from Finland to California and look forward to the 
future.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

has infiltrated the masses worldwide with his dark sound for over a 
decade. Technical Itch is easily one of the most sought-after and 
heralded producers in the game. He is the most in-demand DJ on Anger 
Management's roster, playing nearly every weekend in the UK and Europe, 
along with frequent tours throughout the United States. With all this 
under his belt, Technical Itch is seriously one to reckon with for years

Sat Aug 09                      PLASTIC CITY                     Pittsburgh

Terry Lee Brown Jr., legendary house producer and DJ, is making a 
supremely rare stop in Pittsburgh to give us a special night to remind 
us why we love house music.

Humanaut is extremely proud to present:
Terry Lee Brown Jr
Plastic City - Frankfurt, Germany
Saturday, August 9th @ Moto

For years Terry Lee Brown Jr. has been considered as a member of the 
international elite of House producers, and like no other, he has 
developed the subgenre Tech-House. In the USA and England his first two 
albums became successes of note and the media got a surprise when they 
found out Mr. Brown is actually a German.

Terry Lee Brown Jr, alias Norman Feller, began DJing in 1989 and soon 
thereafter released his first tracks on vinyl under various pseudonyms. 
1994 was the turning point for Norman when he decided to dedicate 
himself totally to music In the following year he invented the 
house-oriented project (alter-ego) Terry Lee Brown Jr. which allowed him 
to create his own sound. Plastic City, which was at that time still a 
very young label, offered Terry an outlet for his music and he has 
stayed true to this label ever since.

After the success of his first 12" releases came his debut Album Brother 
For Real in spring of 1996. This release was a true milestone for 
Tech-House and incorporated elements of Jungle, Trance and Easy 
Listening. The public response to Brother For Real was gigantic, and not 
limited to scenesters. Muzik (12/96), England's most respected dance 
music magazine chose Brother For Real as one of the top ten albums of 
1996 (along with albums from artists like DJ Shadow, Fugees, Underworld 
and Faithless). Marshall Jefferson, the Chicago House legend, honored 
Terry in an album review by simply stating "He is God" (Raveline 
11/1996).

In fall of 1997 Terry's second album Chocolate Chords garnered further 
praise and matched the success of Bother For Real. In America Mixmag 
chose this second effort as one of the top 5 albums of the year.

Terry Lee Brown Jr. is not only a respected producer, but also a much 
sought-after DJ. This side of the artist is apparent when one listens to 
the compilation series Terry's Cafe 1-5. These mixed CDs once again 
found resonance in the music press and received rave reviews from Muzik, 
Urb, XLR8R and other national and international magazines. But the story 
doesn't end there. Remixes from TLB Jr. of such artists as Gabrielle 
(Rise), Nalin & Kane (Talkin' About), Louise (Let's Go Round Again), 
Paul Van Dyk (For An Angel), Paris Red (Love Hurts), and Future Funk 
(Music Takes You High) secured his reputation as a true Remix-Artist.

The third and latest album From Dub Til Dawn is a product of two years 
work and continues the tradition of Terry's genre-bending House-sound. 
>From Dub Til Dawn brings together bass-heavy housegrooves with warm 
atmospheric planes and fragmented vocals. Sound and rhythm are the most 
important in this case. Fusions of House and Dub or Two-Step round out 
the album. Pay attention to the track Take Your Time, which Terry 
produced in cooperation with his friend and label-mate Timewriter.

Today Terry Lee Brown Junior is one of the most happening and respected 
House Artists around. This is probably due to the passion and love he 
invests in his uncompromising productions and mix sets. His albums and 
mix CDs have shown the world that House music not only works on the 
dancefloor, but also in a comfy chair.

Opening duties by: Pittsburgh house music icon : Brother Mike (DC Space)

[i love it! a "LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE"]

LIVE BAND PERFORMANCE!!!
Date: 8/28/08
Time: Doors open at 9pm sharp
Venue: Metropolis 2325 Elm St Cleveland OH. 44113
Ages: 18 to enter, 21 to drink
Cost: $25 Advance (Limited Number Available)
http://www.wantickets.com?e_id=43273
$30 before 10pm @ door; $35 there after


Israel-bred, LA-based psy-trance duo INFECTED MUSHROOM--Amit .Duvdev. 
Duvedevani and Erez Eisen--have been playing to increasingly massive, 
frenzied crowds all over the globe (over 135 shows in 2007 alone), 
thanks to an explosive live show that.s far cry from the staid 
stereotype of dance acts hunched over their laptops and turntables. This 
year Infected Mushroom.s big plans encompass numerous tour dates 
throughout the U.S. and major studio time working on their seventh 
album, due out this summer.

Infected Mushroom will kick off their 2008 tour dates March 13 in 
Austin, TX during SXSW. Joining Duvdev (vocals) and Erez (keyboards) are 
tour guitarist Tommy Cunningham and Brazilian drummer Rogerio Jardim. 
Here the industry will be able to check out a live performance of 
material from Infected Mushroom.s upcoming album and experience 
first-hand why such major festivals as Coachella, Vegoose, Miami.s Ultra 
Music Festival, San Diego Street Scene, L.A..s Monster Massive, Virgin 
Festival in Baltimore, Camp Bisco and Sao Paulo.s Tribe have highlighted 
them on their stages. Other markets Infected Mushroom is confirmed to 
perform in this year include Houston, Dallas, Boulder, Miami, Denver and 
Los Angeles.

2007 was a landmark year for one of electronica.s biggest bands. Besides 
all the aforementioned festival dates plus a headlining slot for over 
500,000 people (last New Years Eve in Rio De Janeiro, with the Black 
Eyed Peas and John Legend), they now rank #9 Overall and the #1 
Psy-Trance Artist Worldwide on DJ Magazine.s prestigious Top 100 DJ 
Poll. The band have moved to Los Angeles to get serious in the studio 
and began working on the follow-up to their album Vicious Delicious.

As told to Allan McGrath of DJ:

.In the last year we.ve come out of the psy-trance bracket, which is 
where we want to go,. Duvdev explains. .We.ve been playing rock venues, 
which we.re happy about as we never wanted to be categorized.. .We.re 
happy that people come and see Infected Mushroom even if they aren.t 
into psy-trance,. adds Erez. .We.re always looking to things we haven.t 
tried before.. Fans of their classic psy-trance pulse need not be too 
concerned though. Already, two of the tracks laid down for their next LP 
are ferocious psy-trancers . with recent tracks .Sayid. and .Nine 
Percent. instigating a full-on reception in their recent live shows. 
.There.s another track called .Black Shwarma. which blends cool lyrics 
with distorted heavy metal guitars,. adds Duvdev..

Sat Sep 20                 STEPPING INTO DARKNESS                Cincinnati

Royal Dubs Presents:
Stepping Into Darkness
September 20, 2008

Cyrus from Random Trio . Dubstep . London, UK - RTP, Tectonic
http://www.myspace.com/randomtrio, randomtrioproductions.com

One of the early pioneering DJ/producers of the sound we now call 
Dubstep, Cyrus from Random Trio 1st began his dj career back in 1998 as 
a ukg Dj. After just 3 months of mixing Cyrus was given his 1st chance 
to play for a local promotion in Croydon, shortly after he was offered a 
residency and never looked back. Various pirate radio shows followed 
along with more bookings for local clubs in & around London. The summer 
of 99 saw Cyrus take his dj'ing to the island of Corfu (Kavos). In this 
time Cyrus had met and became good friends with fellow Random Trio 
member Omni, and by 2000 were doing most of their dj sets together. They 
1st formed a little crew in 2001 consisting of themselves & 3 mc's and 
soon gained a good following. They built their 1st track by the end of 
the year and had heard interest from a major label. However before this 
took place they split going there own separate ways. Cyrus and Omni 
carried on dj'ing together and decided to carry on making beats for 
their radio shows. It was around this time they 1st heard Horsepower 
Productions and were taken aback by their unique style. They found the 
sound they were looking for. By 2003 Cyrus had made a batch of tunes and 
brought out his 1st release on their imprint RTP. This was the Lost City 
EP. January 2004 saw Cyrus with his own show on London's biggest pirate 
Rinse.fm.. One of the early nights was a night put on by DMZ called dub 
sessions held on a Sunday at black sheep bar in Croydon. With a newer 
member, Omen, Random trio have a number of successful releases and more 
recently Cyrus's From the Shadows LP. Random trio have played at clubs 
all over the world from Finland to California and look forward to the 
future.
