Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Me and the usual crew will be there... Can't wait - guess it's time to start thinking about rooms.. I love the Rennaissance because of it's proximity to the Plaza and the fact that MANY people staying there that weekend are there for DEMF- so it's a great place to hang out and meet people..The parties in the hotels are one of the best parts of the weekend. Last year, the first night, the hotel was super strict though..I was thinking about moving over to the Courtyard - plus they have a pool and hot tub.. 
Tell me rooms aren't selling out already!

Who's all going down this year anyways?. I'm sure I'll probably see the same
crew I saw the 2 years I've gone.....

ALl I have to say is that  Donald Glaude rocked the fucking house last Friday...Wish he was on all night..
Anyone know what's going on at 1120 this Friday?

it was a great show, it was at some venue called 1120 which was not the
biggest place in the world, but since there wasn't a really huge turnout

stage and real mellow by the bar, what a great idea! also i'd like to

while. }}

Yes. They do you right at 1120. And I guess it's not as bad as I was saying
before. The basement of 1120 is always the place to be.

we caught the very end of dom & roland's set, so can't really comment on it,
but tech itch really tore it up. voight kamph was great too, but their set
was cut short by equpment problems. the downstairs had hip-hop and some
comfy couches overall a great night, }}

The funny part is how I didn't know about this (not that I'd have gone). I'm
so out of touch. I was there for Goldie and Donald Glaude on friday night
but had to kind of cut that short.

{{ Paul Berezansky

Not really. Sometimes it's okay, but I like Cleveland better. Lots of snotty
fucks in 513 get on my gritty blue-collar nerves. I'm just the son of a
carpenter.

And when am I going to meet this elusive Daniel Hitchcock?

Hey I will probably be going somehow by some magic miracle of GOD, which is 
how I go every year it seems.  But this year I am at the helm taking care of 
the preparations..I probably won't be staying at either hotels but I would 
love to.  I probably will stay at the some place cheaper or the hotel that 
is in the same building the ritchie hawtin afterparty is.

Or something...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Demf/Movement

I already got four rooms at the Hotel Pontchartrain Crown Plaza - located 
right across the street from Hart Plaza - I stay there every year.  
(313-965-0200)

Each room has two double beds and they are only $99 per night.  Not bad 
split 4 ways (if 4 are to stay in a room)  They will try to book the room to 
you for $129 so you have to ask for the 'spring special'.

My Detroit 2 cents.

Subject: {pb-cle} demf : fire & lodging

www.demf.com

i'm back to my senses and staying at the pontchartrain again this year.
they have a pool, a bar and it's 30 seconds from hart plaza.  $99 - nice.
last year as we pulled in to town there was a car on fire right outside the
hotel.  very artful alongside the iron fist.

:)

  I heard the ren. center tripled their prices this year so I am crashing at a friends house.  I think it is around $300 per night.  I'm glad that I get to party in my home state!  :)

Subject: RE: {pb-cle}P. Diddy now a techno artist (?)

We heard PVD drop it -- the last track of his six-hour set -- at Space at
the Winter Music Conference Friday Saturday morning 3/22, with P. Diddy on
stage. He helped PVD hold up a flag that had a peace symbol on it. The P.
Did had a whole crew with him, including Misstress Barbara. Everyone was
dancing singing with the track "...get ill..." It's pretty good; I think
whether or not people will like it depends on whether or not they're into
those kinds of tracks in the first place.

It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that PDiddy's producing this kind of
music. He was a regular at the Space terrace on Sunday mornings in Miami two
years ago, and I remember hearing him vow to get behind dance music, and was
in the works to start his own label even then. If I remember correctly, a
quote from him was, "Damn. This stuff is a lot harder to make than it
seems." I know there are a lot of haters who don't like the fact that he's
involved now, but I think he's the real deal. It can only help edm and work
to bridge different communities. Watching him get into the music, you know
it's real and that he's really feeling it; you get the sense he really
believes in the music and it's working through him, and that he's not just
posing.

THe Pontchartrain sounds like the place to be.. Are they strict about noise and stuff? They have a pool?? That righ there (and reasonable price) is good enough for me! 
Last year on Saturday night in the RenCen security was kicking mad people out of their rooms.. They unlocked the door and walked right into one of my friend's rooms for having more than 5 people in there at once.. Sunday night, strangely, security was nowhere to be seen! 
It wouldn't be hard to believe if they tripled their price for that weekend..

i'm back to my senses and staying at the pontchartrain again this year.
they have a pool, a bar and it's 30 seconds from hart plaza. $99 - nice.
last year as we pulled in to town there was a car on fire right outside the
hotel. very artful alongside the iron fist.

THIS YEAR'S BIG MIAMI TUNES:
Puff Daddy 'Let's Get Ill' (Bad Boy)
This is the one! P Diddy's newie is a dark and dangerous bass heavy snake - think something in the
region of 'Energy Flash' with Puffy rapping, "Let's get up, let's get ill, your dreams have now been
fulfilled" (and repeating it about a million times), with an added vocal by Kelis. Darren Emerson
and
Les Rhythmes Digitales are in the mix.

>From MUZIK.CO.UK's weekly newsletter (sent DURING WMC)

THIS YEAR'S BIG MIAMI TUNES:
Puff Daddy 'Let's Get Ill' (Bad Boy)
This is the one! P Diddy's newie is a dark and dangerous bass heavy
snake - think something in the region of 'Energy Flash' with Puffy
rapping, "Let's get up, let's get ill, your dreams have now been
fulfilled" (and repeating it about a million times), with an added vocal
by Kelis. Darren Emerson and Les Rhythmes Digitales are in the mix.

We heard PVD drop it -- the last track of his six-hour set -- at Space
at the Winter Music Conference Friday Saturday morning 3/22, with P.
Diddy on stage. He helped PVD hold up a flag that had a peace symbol on
it. The P. Did had a whole crew with him, including Misstress Barbara.
Everyone was dancing singing with the track "...get ill..." It's pretty
good; I think whether or not people will like it depends on whether or
not they're into those kinds of tracks in the first place.

It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that PDiddy's producing this kind
of music. He was a regular at the Space terrace on Sunday mornings in
Miami two years ago, and I remember hearing him vow to get behind dance
music, and was in the works to start his own label even then. If I
remember correctly, a quote from him was, "Damn. This stuff is a lot
harder to make than it seems." I know there are a lot of haters who
don't like the fact that he's involved now, but I think he's the real
deal. It can only help edm and work to bridge different communities.
Watching him get into the music, you know it's real and that he's really
feeling it; you get the sense he really believes in the music and it's
working through him, and that he's not just posing.

Thanks to everyone who made it to Abbasso last Saturday for the n space
label event.  It was one of the most energetic crowds I've seen in a
long time.  I met a lot of cool people, and I hope to see you again
soon.  A recording of my mix from that night will be online soon, and
I'll post again when it's ready.
 
Thanks always to those who come out and support every Friday.

THIS sort of thing wouldn't be caused by any sort of raver, ever heard of
RESPECT?  The R in plur isn't for RUDE.

A RAVER would have put a stop to it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle}P. Diddy now a techno artist (?)

All I know about P Diddy outside of the times I've seen him in Miami is what
I've seen on music bio shows like VH1's "In the Music," so I know it's not
much, but...

If I didn't see it for myself, I wouldn't believe it...That guy is the
biggest DJ groupie (let alone superstar groupie) I've ever seen. He goes
from party to party to party (He was at least three different ones that
night...We saw him driving looking for parking in his baby blue convertible
on three separate occasions on Collins, Washington, and then NE 11th
downtown) and gets in the booth, stands in the back and watches the DJ mix
and trainspots and asks questions and cheers on the crowd and eyes the
mixing some more...He gives so much respect to whoever is playing... Hey,
spread the love...I wish more people had that kind of enthusiasm!

Think of how many kids respect P.Diddy's music...Whether or not you respect
him, the fact that he has so many fans, that if they were told, "This is the
music your favorite producer gets down to..." Kids may say..."Oh, maybe
Eminem was wrong...PDiddy's rappin'to techno!"

And I'm sure that the track is big not only because people like it, but also
because it is a sort of statement on how the genre of edm is evolving...That
track will hit the history books because a rap artist crossed over a genre
wall.

I agree with everything you just said, except the last part of it.  Lost =
of rappers have embraced EDM in various ways, from the Jungle Brothers =
to KRS-One.  Even Puffy himself had several songs remixed by the likes =
of Armand Van Helden on the way back machine...

That is a very good point.... but Eminem just did that I think to mess with Moby... I know Ive read many places and all about Eminem attending A LOT of raves himself.

Maybe hes just jaded too... lol.

  The cheapest room I could find at the Ren. Center was $259 per night.  
There seems like there are alot of other hotels that are more affordable.  
Well regardless, I won't be staying at a hotel this year.    It should be a 
fun and crazy weekend!

It's on Saturday.  I think if you're going to be in Pittsburgh, and plan on
going to Fuk Yeah, why not stop by FLUX before hand and enjoy some pre-party
tunes and art.  Technoir-Audio will be upstairs all night (7p-12a) for $7
(or $5 with a book donation) .. video has recently been added to the line-up
(myself).  Type-0 will be downstairs with the other music and live
performance acts, not to mention the many artists' works all over the
building.  I have a feeling that the creative energy will be flowing.  :)

a few of kevin's old rave sets up here for the taking.  the first from the
sasha and dickweed rave which prompted me to join this bloody list.  the
second is from one of my favorite parties to date - history - one of
sine/dusty/kira's at the session space.  i loved that damned space.  also,
the third from one of the astrology parties.

a reminder that flux is doing their thing at the king's court theater in
oakland this saturday night.  a reason to be happy for that space once
again.  high quality, low cost entertainment, folks.  and beer.

Pssh .. P.diddly can eat my dick after licking my chode.  I think he is far
less credible as an artist than -most- electronic music.  Some of these
remix after remix themed bullshit releases -are- indeed very lame .. quite
lame.

be on the lookout deadnb.com should be up by next week....pre-release 
mp3s...mix sets...booking info...soundsystem info...and DEA monthly event 
info...

yeah i know...2 unfinished tunes...ive been rocking out on them 
though...they may even become dearecs002...dearecs001 will be sanatized b/w 
motaba...as soon as we find a decent pressing plant(with less than 8 week 
turnaround)...also...DEA Volume 2 - Operation Pipe Dreams (mixed by 
myself)is availible for download...if you want it and cant wait for the site 
to come online, hit me private stylee and ill point you towards my slsk and 
add you to my list....this mix cd is ALL ORIGINAL...every tune on there is 
DEA orginal material...

if anyone that knows of a good pressing plant in the pb-cle area please get 
to me ASAP...only thing is, they must be willing to do small 
runs(300)...plating and mastering is not an issue

Hey everyone!

Just last week I played on the Cleveland 

airwaves on a show called the Beat Matrix. 

(www.beatmatrix.net)

I got a great soundboard recording of it 

LIVE, so I'll be getting it professionally 

duplicated to be handed out. (Much like 

Love Letter)

However, it's now online streamable and downloadable here:

http://www.djmoose.com/music/wruw96.m3u 

(96 kpbs stream)       
http://andy.selekta.com/moose/wruw160.mp3

(download 160 kbps mp3 76MB)

The Tracklisting is as follows:
(also available at breakbeatmilitia.com)

 

1.       Magic Mike and Infiniti - 2001 [Funk Wax]

2.       Proper Filthy Naughty - To the Beat [10 Kilo]

3.       Soul of Man - Acid Punch [Finger Lickin']

4.       Roni Size - Papa's got a brand new brown paper bag [Promo]

5.       Ghetto Funk - Push Up [White]

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Apr 05                         REBIRTH                             D.C.

D Tribe Productions is proud to present:
REBIRTH
APRIL 5TH 2003

D Tribe Productions is extremely excited to bring you what we consider to 
be one of our best line ups yet. For this one we brought some of the DJ's 
that we first introduced to DC, a few DJ's that have never been to DC and 
a couple favorites that we feel capture that D Tribe sound of funky house 
and breaks.

House DJ's include:

PAUL JOHNSON (Dust Traxx/ Nocturnal Interlude/ Chicago)
Over a year ago D Tribe's "Galactic Groove" was the first DC party to host 
this house legend. Paul is known world wide for continuously setting and 
resetting the direction of house music. We are extremely honored to have 
him back at one of our events.

ERIC DAVENPORT (Geisha House Music/ DTB/ Los Angeles)
This guy is one of the true pioneers of the underground dance circuit, 
having now played his own unique style of funky house in over 70 cities 
worldwide. We are excited to welcome Eric Davenport to one our events and 
we think he'll feel right at home amongst the house and breaks lovers who 
party with us.

DJ FUNK (Funk Records/ Chicago)
The undisputed king of booty house made his first appearance in Washington 
DC at a little annual event D Tribe named "Good Times." Since then DJ Funk 
has become a DC favorite and has always delivered that funk 
that he is so famous for. All booty house DJs have his records in their 
vinyl boxes and every booty house lover has heard him perform and can't 
wait to hear him again.

TRANSLUCENT (G-Swing/ Dust Traxx/ Transparent records/ Chicago)
His unique style and sound sets him apart from any DJ you've ever heard by 
playing TRUMPET LIVE WHILE SPINNING RECORDS!!!, combining the elements of 
live jazz with electronic music. His new label, Transparent Recordings, is 
slated for upcoming releases by Paul Johnson, Boo Williams and Craig 
Alexander.

LEXUS KING (Luv Child Ent./ Instinctive Grooves/ DC)
One of DC's favorite local DJs and a D Tribe favorite as well. Lexus King 
always brings that incredible sound of house music to any party and always 
keeps the floor moving from his first record to to his last.

RICHIE RICH (D Tribe Productions/ Rush NightLife Entertainment/ D.C.)
His house music is described as funky, vocal, latin and instrumental. His 
breaks are simply "old skool" and full of funky bass lines. This guy is 
all about making people move.

Break DJ's include:

TONY FALINE (Union Records/ Tampa Florida)
This is definitley one of our favorite DJs that we have had the pleasure 
to indroduce to our nation's capital. The last time he was here he left an 
ever lasting impression on every breaks lover who was in the crowd. Til 
this day
people still talk to us about his performance and we feel that it's been 
too long since DC welcomed this breaks favorite back.

GUMBEE (Zone Records/ Moonshine Music/ Soundvision/ Las Vegas, NV)
Here is yet another DJ that we are proud to be the first to bring to DC. 
Expect an incredible performance from him! Specializing in funky breaks, 
Gumbee's access to many unreleased new tracks, a wide variety of hard to 
find "old skool" and his unique programming style makes him one of the 
freshest DJs in the circuit.

DJ LOVE (Stellar Music/ Dallas Texas)
This will be DJ Love's first visit to to the Washington DC area. He has 
releases on Tommy Boy, Fabric Live and his very own Stellar Music. 
Breakbeats, hip hop, funk, soul and turntablism encompass Love's 
presentation on the decks. With precision cuts and scratches, and seamless 
mixing, Love has earned the title as a "Mixmaster" in his current 
hometown, Dallas, Texas. You do not want to miss this!!

JONH (Red Menace Records/ Moonshine Music/ DC)
One of DC's very own superstars. He has recently been signed to Moonshine 
Records and has releases out with DJ Dan, Simply Jeff and a bunch of other 
projects in the works. He is quickly becoming a superstar to look out for.
Recent releases include work with Rascal such as "Domino","America" and 
"TenDays."

DJ JOEY NEEL (D Tribe Productions/ Rush NightLife Entertainment/ DC)
DC's very own "old skool" breaks favorite. Always staying true to that old 
school hip hop oriented breaks sound and always keeping it funky the D 
Tribe way. His collection of old funky tracks and newer hard to find 
releases keep
you dancing and guessing what he's got in that vinyl box to throw down 
next.

Hip Hop / Raggae DJ's

ARMAGEDDON (Washington D.C, Hip Hop/Raggae Music)
We decided to add a little hip hop and raggae to move your asses to a 
slower beat at this party. The person that first came to mind to mix up 
that old school hip hop and raggae sound was Armageddon. We met him a 
little while back while out in DC and his style of music caught our 
attention and we had to share him with everyone.

TRINSTAR (Muzik Nashun/ Washington DC Sound/ DC)
Trinstar has 12 years of experience under his belt and is from Trinidad 
and Tobago. His style of old raggae mixed with today's raggae is sure to 
take you to a happy place. His record label "Muzik Nashun" is a Washington 
DC based company and he is one of the front people pushing raggae in DC.

provided by Cosmic Traveler in Columbus, performing live and DJ sets,

ideal to you, your presence would only add to the beautiful atmosphere of
the event.

an online mapping engine ahead of time for more elaborate directions.

Disclaimer:

This event is the emergence of an alternative community. Beyond the
obvious enjoyment of music, fellow human beings, and nature, its aim is to
end the perpetuation of certain elements in our societal structure. That
means that if anyone in attendance expresses classism, racism, sexism, or
violence they will be removed by Antioch College Securities if they don't
re-evaluate their ignorance immediately. This event is more than a
protest, it is an affirmation.

This event brought to you by Experimedia Communications, Molotov Records, 
Headroom Digital, Shift Club Night, and Touch Supper Club.

"This is one of the most significant rosters I've ever observed to grace 
the area and it's even more taunting for me that I couldn't be there to 
support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're truly privileged to be 
offered such rare appearances courtesy of the event producers who're 
credited. Those responsible obviously share an increasingly rare 
enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast with most 'parties'. 
They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an intimate setting, thus 
providing an amazing opportunity to witness these talents whose impact is 
undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all involved and encourage 
anyone who can't stand 'the same' music being played at 'parties' to treat 
yourself to an evening of what is sure to be a great experience and 
hopefully an eye-opening impression on a few of you!"

All Ages Show $7 8PM sharp

all in all one of the lineups i've been looking forward to seeing more 
than
anything.  doormouse may be most known for his antics, but his music
is just as smashing. otto von schirach is one of the most weird, 
innovative,
and fun producers around, the punk king of glitch.  and baseck
has pretty much crushed everybody who hears him play...insane scratch and
cut skills applied to breakcore.  with locals impercept doing a live set,
and adam bomb dropping a set of original pittsburgh d&b...should be
hot all around.

on the ground,unless you want to help us pick them up in the morning),and 
also if you`re handed a flier that you don`t want,either tell the person 
handing them out you don`t want it,or take it and put it in the 
trash,there will be plenty of bags around,same goes for water bottles and 
anything else you might throw on the ground.This is a beautiful venue 
surrounded by a state park,so try to keep everything nice looking. This 
venue is in the middle of no where and all permits have or will be taken 
care of,so this event is sure to go off without any problems.

in trouble and the event shut down.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Looking for a print compay(pgh area)

I was hopping someone might be able to help me with this.

Im working on a cd layout project right now, and my client wants
black/white printing on a paper stock that resembles a brown paper bag.

So I either need contact info for a printer you might know, or a rough
price quote for about 100 cd's.  It will be a multi page insert, Im still
unsure of the # of pages.

Thanx in advance.
Will

PS. I might need cd printing also, info would be great.

stop reading the newspaper, it's time to have fun and
shake dat ass!!!

booties are bouncing. He has rocked parties around the
world, including sets in Germany, Holland, France,
Spain and throughout North America. Each time it's the
same: When he steps up to the decks and unleashes that
high-speed booty-shake, the audience has only one
option -- to shut up and dance.

the electro classic you are referring to is TOUR DE FRANCE as 
kelly has mentioned. (damnit! its a classic! everyone should know 
it damnit!) 

anyhow, the version we hear in the film is NOT kraftwerk's 
version, it is the version done by the group 10-speed.

(good luck finding the 10-speed version on 12" im still looking 
for it.)

Thanks to Ed Um for the incredible set he played and for the great vibe he 
created at Havana last night.  DC Space held it down also.

Thanks to all you Pittsburgh heads for coming out too.

hell yeah, ed umm crushed it. i even got my dance on for a bit,
and i only had one drink. it was just a combo of the illest tunes
and the nice weather after a little break from going out on
thursday nights, and i was definitely feeling it. i love the
spring time.......

Come out and join us and many of your friends.  You'd be suprised who you
just might run into @ Abasso.  Fair priced drinks and good fun people.  The
thing you gotta love is that there are absolutely no bad attitudes and no
fake plastic people.  Do check it out if you haven't had the chance.

Metz, Myself and possibly a guest are gonna be bumping some house music all
night long.  Still Life will be closing it all out with some drum & bass and
broken beat house (and I am hoping some electro).

9pm-5am (or 6am if you move your watch ahead at 2!)

Anyone have a clue at all what the set times will be?  Was out all last
night and don't feel like waiting till 4am to see Pleasurehead spin.  If
anyone is in the know at all, I'd appreciate a reply.  Thanks!

--0-49830420-1049652902=:54009
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Hey. I was just wondering if anyone has any access to madonna's new music. she has a really cool song, which she (i guess) is just calling "techno-dance" music, but i heard it the other day on one of those digital cable special music channels (don't ya just love those)  and i searched for it on kazaa (multiple times) but nothing came up.   Just wondering if someone could send me her new tunes.  She's a doll.

Janet

PS, I took some movies too, but i've got to figure out a decent way to make 
short .avi's not 20mb files.

Subject: {pb-cle} new to Columbus

I just moved to Columbus three days ago, and I know a
total of three people(roommates). I don't know my way
around town to find Ritual or any other place. I 
missed Judge Jules last night because I am limited for
right now.  If anyone fells like getting to know a new
friend and junglist, please drop me a private e-mail
and maybe I can get out before Clockwork.

                           Thanks!
                            Sharpie

Subject: {pb-cle} BSP: WRUW Telethon - Support the Beat Matrix!

--Boundary_(ID_Znd2cKcozZx2yhmkixX7FQ)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

I just wanted to let you guys know that the annual WRUW-FM 91.1 Telethon
is starting this week.  Please support the station and the Beat Matrix
by calling in with your pledges (preferably during our show on Monday
night). 
 
Reasons why you should support WRUW:
-WRUW is completely commercial free and brings you the latest music of
all varieties.
-The Telethon is the only time of the year that the station generates
revenue and it bases its budget off of its telethon earnings.
-The money you donate will go towards maintaining and upgrading
equipment at the station.  Past telethon's helped to fund the power
increase to 15,000 watts so that it could bring the music to you in high
fidelity audio!  There are even more ways to increase the station's
audio quality and can only be achieved with the community's support.
-Money donated also goes towards purchasing the latest CDs so that we
can play them for YOU.
-The live web stream can also be improved with your support!
-The Beat Matrix is the only radio show in Cleveland that brings you a
different guest DJ every week for free!  If you bought a mix CD every
week it would cost you over $800 a year.  A small donation to the
station goes a long way towards improving the ways we expose local
talent and bring new music to the community!  Even if you donated $40
dollars to the station, it would come out to ~ 75 cents per mix set.
-You can even donate with a credit card which gives us the money
instantly!
 
I could spout out a lot more reasons why you should support WRUW, but
I'll shut up before they release the hounds.
 
Remember, this is the one time during the year that you can show your
support!
 
The Beat Matrix runs every Monday night from 10:30pm - 12:30am.  Please
call in with your donations 216.368.2208.
 
Thanks for your support.

Subject: {pb-cle} One More thing about the Telethon

One more thing I'd like to mention:

As a thank you for your donation of forty dollars, WRUW will send you
one of several nice electronic music compilations of the music we play
on the Beat Matrix.   If you are able to donate seventy-five dollars,
you will have a choice of premiums including a WRUW sweatshirt or polo
shirt.  If you aren't able to afford forty or seventy-five dollars,
donate what you can.  Whatever you are able to donate, it is important
that you call and show your support for the Beat Matrix.  

In addition, listeners who donate will be entered into a drawing for a
copy of 
Techno Rebels - a rare, well-done, and accurate documentary on the
global 
rise of electronic music.

Again the phone number for the station is 216.368.2208.  Thanks for you
time.

Yes, I am.  I lurk alot though...

Someone submitted the profile to me a while back along with a number of 
other profiles for DJs from Cleveland.  Sorry for any mistake there, I 
updated the profile with the correct information already...

{{ LovingTheThrill@aol.com }
what happened to jes's request for the roll call? }}

Too early. Ravers have ADD and can't plan more than 4 days in advance.

Maybe I'm just talking about myself, though. I intend to be there at this
point, but who knows what the future will hold? I'm just the son of a
carpenter.

Subject: {pb-cle} ACTION ALERTS:  RAVE Act

Please take the time to respond to Action Alerts posted below.  The first alert addresses an attempt by Senator Biden (D-DE) to sneak the RAVE
Act into another bill, S.B. 151, a popular bill about child abduction that
has nothing to do with drug issues.   Details for both alerts are below.
>
Thank you in advance for your support!
>
>==========================================
>
>ACTION ALERT 1:
>
>*** EMERGENCY - JOE BIDEN TRYING TO SNEAK RAVE ACT INTO S151   
>    Conference 
>*** CALL YOUR SENATOR NOW
>
>Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) is at this very moment attempting to sneak 
>the RAVE Act into conference committee on the National AMBER Alert 
>Network Act of 2003 (S151).  S151 is a popular bill about child 
>abduction and has nothing to do with drug issues.  S151 has already 
>been passed by the Senate and House and is now in Conference.  In 
>contrast, the RAVE Act has not passed even one single committee this 
>year.  It did pass a committee last year, but was so controversial 
>two Senators withdrew their sponsorship after the vote.  
>
>This means that if the RAVE Act passes the conference committee, it 
>is likely to become law without ever having a hearing, a debate or a 
>vote.  Drug Policy Alliance reports being told that Senator Biden has told
>other conference committee members, incorrectly, that the ACLU is no longer
>in opposition to the action.  He also has told conferees that nightclub
>owners now support him (on the basis of one group that 
>switched sides).  If the act makes it into the conference language it 
>is likely to become law.  It must be stopped now.
>
>PHONE YOUR SENATORS and Conference Committee Members (Background 
>information below).  DO IT NOW.  If you do not respond to this alert, 
>the controversial RAVE Act is likely to become law and it will be 
>much harder to fix.  
>
>ACTIONS TO TAKE:
>
>1.  The following Members of Congress are on the conference 
>committee.  They need to hear from you IF AND ONLY IF you live in 
>their district.  Please be polite.  Just tell them that you oppose 
>the RAVE Act, that it is controversial and it should not be included 
>in the conference language of S151.  Don't stay on the phone long.  
>Ask as many people as you can to call them.
>
>HOUSE:
>James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) - 202/225-5101
>Howard Coble (R-NC) - 202/225-3065
>Lamar Smith (R-TX) - 202/225-4236

>this issue with the conferees.  A list of your Senators by state can

>http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm.  
>Please call your Senators at the Capitol Switchboard at 202/224-3121 -
>please tell them that the RAVE Act is very controversial.  Senator 
>Biden is holding up the AMBER Act by placing controversial bill in 
>conference.  Urge them to oppose the RAVE Act by contacting the 
>Senate conferees and asking them to leave it off the measure so that 
>there will at least be a hearing on this issue.  
>
>BACKGROUND INFORMATION
>
>Congress is considering two pieces of legislation that could create 
>disincentives for club owners to have water, ambulances and 
>paramedics available at large dance events.  The bills might also 
>threaten live music and dancing. If enacted, either bill could 
>prevent you from hearing your favorite band or DJ live. Every musical 
>style would be affected, including rock and roll, Hip Hop, country, 
>and electronic music. The proposed laws could also shut down hemp 
>festivals, circuit parties, and other events government officials 
>don't like. Both bills would allow overzealous prosecutors to send 
>innocent people to jail for the crimes of others. 
>
>The two bills are the RAVE Act (H.R. 718) and the CLEAN-UP Act (H.R. 
>834). The RAVE Act was first introduced last year in the Senate by 
>Senator Joe Biden (D-DE). A House version was introduced by Rep. 
>Lamar Smith (R-TX). Thanks to the support of thousands of voters like 
>you, a coalition of friends and activists around the country was able to
>stop both bills last year. Unfortunately, supporters of the RAVE Act are
>even more determined to pass it this year. Rep. Howard Coble (R-NC) is
>sponsoring a new RAVE Act in the House. Additionally, Senator Biden has
>introduced a Senate version entitled the Illicit Drugs Anti-Proliferation
>Act.
>
>If enacted, the RAVE Act would make it easier for the federal 
>government to punish property owners for any drug offense that their 
>customers commit - even if they work hard to stop such offenses. If 
>enacted, nightclub and stadium owners would likely stop holding 
>events - such as rock or Hip Hop concerts - in which even one person 
>might use drugs. 
>
>The CLEAN-UP Act was also first introduced last year, but it failed 
>to make it out of committee. This year's bill has over 60 co-sponsors 
>and could become law without your help. Sponsored by Rep. Doug Ose (R- CA),
>the Clean, Learn, Educate, Abolish, and Undermine Production 
>(CLEAN-UP) of Methamphetamines Act is largely an innocuous bill that 
>provides more money and training for the clean up of illegal 
>methamphetamine lab. Hidden within the bill, however, is a draconian 
>section that could make dancing and live music federal crimes.
>
>Section 305 of the CLEAN-UP Act stipulates that: 
>
>`Whoever, for a commercial purpose, knowingly promotes any rave, 
>dance, music, or other entertainment event, that takes place under 
>circumstances where the promoter knows or reasonably ought to know 
>that a controlled substance will be used or distributed in violation 
>of Federal law or the law of the place where the event is held, shall 
>be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned for not 
>more than 9 years, or both.'
>
>This provision will allow any concert promoter, event organizer, 
>nightclub owner and arena or stadium owner to be fined and jailed, 
>since a reasonable person would know some people use drugs at musical 
>events. 
>
>Under both the RAVE Act and the CLEAN-UP Act, it doesn't matter if 
>the event promoter and property owner try to prevent people from 
>using drugs. Nor does it matter if the vast majority of people 
>attending the event are law-abiding citizens that want to listen to 
>music not do drugs. If enacted, either bill could be used to shut 
>down raves, circuit parties, marijuana rallies, unpopular music 
>concerts, and any other event federal officials don't like.
>

Oppose the Culture War on Raves

Members of both the House and Senate are attempting to pervert proper legislative processes by appending two unrelated provisions to the popular Amber Alert measure.  One of the two provisions would target raves -- a social event that mixes electronic music, light shows and dancing; the other provision would seek to limit the discretion of federal judges.

The rave provision would make building owners liable for their tenants' and customers' activities.  For example, even if they instituted excellent security precautions, restaurant, bar, nightclub, dance and music venue owners could all be fined hundreds of thousands of dollars and forced into bankruptcy if a customer sneaked in drugs. No matter how much security is put in place, they could be held responsible for the actions of just one customer. 

The federal sentencing provision would require the Justice Department to report to Congress every time federal judges use their discretion to impose a lower sentence than recommended under federal sentencing guidelines.  This would intimidate judges and prevent them from using their judgement when handing down sentences.

These anti-civil liberties amendments should have full legislative review and not be allowed to piggyback on more popular, yet unrelated, legislation.

Hey Guys,
I have a couple of friends who were promised by Judge Jules himself, to =
be on the guestlist (Free not reduced list) but when they got there =
around 10:45 security said there was no list. So not having enough =
money, they left.  Anyway they emailed Jules to see why there was no =
list.  Here is what he said :

"Hi there,

On Saturday morning I arrived at Toronto airport, where I'd been playing =
on Friday night, and 90% of all flights had been cancelled due to snow =
(including every flight to the US that day.)  I therefore had to take a =
taxi from Toronto to Columbus, which took nearly eight hours, cost me a =
ridiculous amount of money, and I didn't arrive in Columbus til 11.30pm, =
where I was due on the turntables at midnight. =20

I did put your name on the list, but because I arrived so late, it =
wasn't til around midnight that it was on the door.  I'm sorry that your =
night was spoiled, but as you can tell, I had quite a bad day too!

All the best,
Jules."

I am very impressed with Jules to get back to them.  This just shows =
that even the biggest name DJ's still have some class to them and still =
care about the little people.  What about riding in a taxi, paying the =
driver, then spinning right away!

And...what about paying for an EIGHT HOUR TAXI RIDE?!?!?!

Wouldn't it have been cheaper to rent a car?? Even one-way??

That's dedication. Props to JJ, even if I don't dig him as a DJ.

Subject: {pb-cle} fuk yeah, great party

a great party, i was so glad it lasted till 6am.
pleasurehead is a great DJ, i'm not too impressed
with many hard house/trance DJs anymore but he was
definitely tearing shit up. j-smooth was great
he spun for quite a while, played a nice wide
selection of dnb. yamez played a good dnb set
as well

nice dark atmosphere upstairs, they shoulda made
the main room just as dark. upstairs had really
great sound.

i got a great vibe from everyone, hope to see more
events like this.

Wouldn't it have been cheaper to rent a car?? Even one-way??

That's dedication. Props to JJ, even if I don't dig him as a DJ.

Hey Guys,
I have a couple of friends who were promised by Judge Jules himself, to be on the guestlist (Free
not reduced list) but when they got there around 10:45 security said there was no list. So not
having enough money, they left. Anyway they emailed Jules to see why there was no list. Here is
what he said :

"Hi there,

On Saturday morning I arrived at Toronto airport, where I'd been playing on Friday night, and 90% of
all flights had been cancelled due to snow (including every flight to the US that day.) I therefore
had to take a taxi from Toronto to Columbus, which took nearly eight hours, cost me a ridiculous
amount of money, and I didn't arrive in Columbus til 11.30pm, where I was due on the turntables at
midnight.

I did put your name on the list, but because I arrived so late, it wasn't til around midnight that
it was on the door. I'm sorry that your night was spoiled, but as you can tell, I had quite a bad
day too!

All the best,
Jules."

I am very impressed with Jules to get back to them. This just shows that even the biggest name DJ's
still have some class to them and still care about the little people. What about riding in a taxi,
paying the driver, then spinning right away!

Donnie

Hey. I was just wondering if anyone has any access to madonna's new music. she has a really cool song, which she (i guess) is just calling "techno-dance" music, but i heard it the other day on one of those digital cable special music channels (don't ya just love those) and i searched for it on kazaa (multiple times) but nothing came up. Just wondering if someone could send me her new tunes. She's a doll.

Subject: {pb-cle} bsp: Gaia outdoor this weekend

Just a reminder for this weekend..If you are into 
the goa/psy scene, this will be a great time. Dress
warm! DJ Sheherazade has been added to the lineup.
This is a free event.

Flyer and info can be viewed at www.goaheadproductions.com 

peace,
Luke

Gaia outdoor
Saturday, April 12th, 8pm until 3am
Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio 45387

fire, food, music, nature... free

erth (live)
Malachi - Cleveland
Meghan - Cleveland
Psyphon - Pittsburgh
Sweet Chaos - Pittsburgh
sheherazade - Cleveland

Directions:

Located 1/3 mile South-East of the intersection of 68/Xenia Ave and Corry
St in downtown Yellow Springs is a vast field in front of Antioch
College's Main Building. In this field we will be setting up sound
provided by Cosmic Traveler in Columbus, performing live and DJ sets,
trancing/dancing to stimulating music, watching fire, sharing
vegetarian/vegan food, conversing, and camping afterwards. If this sounds
ideal to you, your presence would only add to the beautiful atmosphere of
the event.

Further Information:

Call Dan at 937.769.1465, email dmarks@antioch-college.edu, or reference
an online mapping engine ahead of time for more elaborate directions.
Parking is available in the large drives on the North and South sides of
the field, as well as across the street in the Glen Helen parking lot. The
flyer can be found on www.goaheadproductions.com, www.cosmictraveler.com,
or www.sidetrakkt.com.

Disclaimer:

This event is the emergence of an alternative community. Beyond the
obvious enjoyment of music, fellow human beings, and nature, its aim is to
end the perpetuation of certain elements in our societal structure. That
means that if anyone in attendance expresses classism, racism, sexism, or
violence they will be removed by Antioch College Securities if they don't
re-evaluate their ignorance immediately. This event is more than a
protest, it is an affirmation.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

April                         WRUW pledge drive                   Cleveland

I just wanted to let you guys know that the annual WRUW-FM 91.1 Telethon
is starting this week.  Please support the station and the Beat Matrix
by calling in with your pledges (preferably during our show on Monday
night). 
 
Reasons why you should support WRUW:
-WRUW is completely commercial free and brings you the latest music of
all varieties.
-The Telethon is the only time of the year that the station generates
revenue and it bases its budget off of its telethon earnings.
-The money you donate will go towards maintaining and upgrading
equipment at the station.  Past telethon's helped to fund the power
increase to 15,000 watts so that it could bring the music to you in high
fidelity audio!  There are even more ways to increase the station's
audio quality and can only be achieved with the community's support.
-Money donated also goes towards purchasing the latest CDs so that we
can play them for YOU.
-The live web stream can also be improved with your support!
-The Beat Matrix is the only radio show in Cleveland that brings you a
different guest DJ every week for free!  If you bought a mix CD every
week it would cost you over $800 a year.  A small donation to the
station goes a long way towards improving the ways we expose local
talent and bring new music to the community!  Even if you donated $40
dollars to the station, it would come out to ~ 75 cents per mix set.
-You can even donate with a credit card which gives us the money
instantly!
 
As a thank you for your donation of forty dollars, WRUW will send you
one of several nice electronic music compilations of the music we play
on the Beat Matrix.   If you are able to donate seventy-five dollars,
you will have a choice of premiums including a WRUW sweatshirt or polo
shirt.  If you aren't able to afford forty or seventy-five dollars,
donate what you can.  Whatever you are able to donate, it is important
that you call and show your support for the Beat Matrix.  

In addition, listeners who donate will be entered into a drawing for a
copy of Techno Rebels - a rare, well-done, and accurate documentary on the
global rise of electronic music.
 
Remember, this is the one time during the year that you can show your
support!
 
The Beat Matrix runs every Monday night from 10:30pm - 12:30am.  Please
call in with your donations 216.368.2208.

provided by Cosmic Traveler in Columbus, performing live and DJ sets,
trancing/dancing to stimulating music, watching fire, sharing
vegetarian/vegan food, conversing, and camping afterwards. If this sounds
ideal to you, your presence would only add to the beautiful atmosphere of
the event.

Further Information:

Call Dan at 937.769.1465, email dmarks@antioch-college.edu, or reference
an online mapping engine ahead of time for more elaborate directions.
Parking is available in the large drives on the North and South sides of
the field, as well as across the street in the Glen Helen parking lot. The
flyer can be found on www.goaheadproductions.com, www.cosmictraveler.com,
or www.sidetrakkt.com.

Disclaimer:

This event is the emergence of an alternative community. Beyond the
obvious enjoyment of music, fellow human beings, and nature, its aim is to
end the perpetuation of certain elements in our societal structure. That
means that if anyone in attendance expresses classism, racism, sexism, or
violence they will be removed by Antioch College Securities if they don't
re-evaluate their ignorance immediately. This event is more than a
protest, it is an affirmation.

This event brought to you by Experimedia Communications, Molotov Records, 
Headroom Digital, Shift Club Night, and Touch Supper Club.

"This is one of the most significant rosters I've ever observed to grace 
the area and it's even more taunting for me that I couldn't be there to 
support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're truly privileged to be 
offered such rare appearances courtesy of the event producers who're 
credited. Those responsible obviously share an increasingly rare 
enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast with most 'parties'. 
They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an intimate setting, thus 
providing an amazing opportunity to witness these talents whose impact is 
undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all involved and encourage 
anyone who can't stand 'the same' music being played at 'parties' to treat 
yourself to an evening of what is sure to be a great experience and 
hopefully an eye-opening impression on a few of you!"

ADDICT `GANGSTA BASS INC. TOUR 2003
more puddin' than you can imagine...

GONZOJUNGLISM // finalscratch'd originals / hunter s thompson of drum and
bass

the Garfield Artworks / 4931 Penn Ave
All Ages Show $7 8PM sharp

all in all one of the lineups i've been looking forward to seeing more 
than
anything.  doormouse may be most known for his antics, but his music
is just as smashing. otto von schirach is one of the most weird, 
innovative,
and fun producers around, the punk king of glitch.  and baseck
has pretty much crushed everybody who hears him play...insane scratch and
cut skills applied to breakcore.  with locals impercept doing a live set,
and adam bomb dropping a set of original pittsburgh d&b...should be
hot all around.

The party will start at 8:30 pm and go until 7:00 am,so come out and party 
through the sunset and party until the sun rises again.

things easier.You won`t want to miss this event,there will be music that 
everyone can enjoy. Water,glowsticks,all that fun ravey stuff will be 
available,also.

Fliers will be done (hopefully) by the 28th of March.

Since this is an outdoor event the only thing we ask of you (aside from 
comming and making this party a blast) is that you respect the 
property,this means try to put your cigarette butts where they belong (not 
on the ground,unless you want to help us pick them up in the morning),and 
also if you`re handed a flier that you don`t want,either tell the person 
handing them out you don`t want it,or take it and put it in the 
trash,there will be plenty of bags around,same goes for water bottles and 
anything else you might throw on the ground.This is a beautiful venue 
surrounded by a state park,so try to keep everything nice looking. This 
venue is in the middle of no where and all permits have or will be taken 
care of,so this event is sure to go off without any problems.

No drugs,Alcohol,Markers,Weapons or anything else that might get you or us 
in trouble and the event shut down.

Info line will be 724.831.1373 for anyone who needs info about something 
to do with the event.

Email us at rrp2k3@yahoo.com if you`re interested about playing and we`ll 
send you an address to send your demo to.

Venue is about 35 minutes north of Pittsburgh,4 turns off 79 (exit 
96),more specific directions will be posted as soon as the fliers are out.

Subject: {pb-cle} Online Music Sharing

I am doing a persuasive speech on online music sharing and how it affects 
artists. I would like to get enough information to defend both points of 
view (helping artists vs. hindering artists).

I was wondering if anybody had any articles saved or would like to pass 
along their own thoughts and feelings which I may quote from or learn 
from...I should have been taking notes when we all hadthis discussion 
before, but alas...

I would really appreciate it, no worries either way

Thanks in advance,

paul

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Online Music Sharing

You can start by combing the pb-cle archvies for all I have said on the
matter and the other side.

80% decrease in single sales (which will be discontinued by years end - but
may move to online).

I will say that the decline in cd sales is not due solely to filesharing ---
it is due LARGELY in part to one person burning a copy of a cd for 5+
friends.

Filesharing & burning has become a status symbol, just like having a large
record collection.  He with the most mp3 is "cool" because he can say "I
will burn you a copy" and make an instant friend.


plus there is much much much more, but i won't waste any more time rehashing
the past :)

i refuse to believe this. dont you remember 10 years ago when the
first CD resale shops opened up? all these same arguments were
made then. the artists still dont make any money from those sales,
but CD sales have continued to go up until recently. im telling
you, its plain and simple, music today sucks and is too expensive.
thats the ONLY problem.

You show me a $5 CD and I would start buying CDs again. As is, I
purchase about 2 or 3 a year.

I wholeheartedly agree for "popular" music. DAMN the crap that is in 
mainstream record stores, MTV etc.

I wonder how sales of "older" music is? I wonder if there is a way to plot 
the sales decay of older albums verses this trend.  IE, after 20 years if 
people want something on cd, (old Ozzy for example) do they buy it or do 
they go download it?  Is the number of people who would buy it now in the 
digital age different from the number that would have bought it before the 
mp3 craze?  This would be proof that music is either not worth buying 
because it is too expensive or if people are just thieves.

i know that personally i buy mostly older CDs especially in the 
jazz and reggae/dub genres, because the prices are usually 
reasonable ($12-15 in most cases) and those genres in particular 
are really good at reissuing good albums with the original art 
along with good essays and history of the music included.

CD's are just too expensive to begin with. They're outrageuosly
overpriced by a magnatude of hundreds of %. The record industry is dead.
Lawsuits and blaming piracy are a last ditch effort to legitimize raping
you for A WHOLE 11 SONGS!

I just can't see blaming the current sales losses being reported on
piracy. It's just plain ignorant to assume or blame piracy. The music
industry of the pre 1990's just can't compete with movies, concert
dvd's, video games, niche radio (satellite, internet), etc. As an
artist, even though I'm far from big time, I realize this, and try and
get my music in all the places I can. I contribute to open source game
soundtracks, do sound work for web designers, and... I'm collaborating
on a top secret media project with some other pb-cle'ers. *bump*

The world, in fact, is getting smaller and smaller -- and it's changing
the ways that people take in entertainment. I'm surprised every day by
the new stuff I hear by local folks and local folks on the other side of
the planet. People are waking up and realizing that your Linkin Bizkits
are as plastic as your Backsync Britney's. This is just the first half
of the revolution, the next step is not being pushed, and it really
needs to be.

What's that next step? Business. </rant>

i know that personally i buy mostly older CDs especially in the 
jazz and reggae/dub genres, because the prices are usually 
reasonable ($12-15 in most cases) and those genres in particular 
are really good at reissuing good albums with the original art 
along with good essays and history of the music included.

Well it is pointless to argue it objectively on an internet mailing list.
It's like trying to sell ice at the north pole.

The lady who owns the laundromat I use said it best...

"I haven't bought a cd since we got a cable modem... my son just finds
everything and downloads it for me.


and i have told exact sales figures before time and time again.


And you can ask anyone who works in normal music store "do you have so and
so... i couldn't find it to download online"

and the only thing you are going to hear from someone who file shares is how
this is not true.


just wait and see... the latest step in inpependent dance scene is to black
ball any dj who fileshares from getting promos... gotta love it.... and djs
who are on promo lists are getting taken off them if they get caught playing
pirated material... just a little co-operation among friends.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Online Music Sharing

i think this is already happening.  the problem is, is its hard to catch.  i
wont mention any names but ive seen people throw down unauthorised promos
and they had everyone thinking that it was authorised.  its your word
against theirs.  now, i have freinds that do this and use my final scratch
to do it, but i think there is a grey area with a free gig.  personally, i
do download the unrealeased shit but i never will play them with out
permission.  plus i still spin 75% vinyl even though i own this technology.
seeings as how i am a producer and would like to sell my singles, i have to
be this way.  others simply dont give a fuck and you wont be able to make
them care no matter how hard you try.  the way i look at it is: selling hard
copies of music is going to die, musicians that make there living this way
will have to find another way to make money.  is this a bad thing???  it is
for somepeople but what are you going to do about it?

i dont think there is anything wrong with discussing this matter again.  ill
read the replies.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Online Music Sharing

I just figured it was time this went OT, but since the bomb chimed in, 
I can't.

After pondering the reply quite a bit, it would seem to me that by 
blackballing a dj who plays a pirated tune, perpetuates a system that 
doesn't work. There should be other options to let that person have 
that track legitimately. There's no business sense in making tracks 
totally unavailable, which is often the case in the dance music 
industry. Oops, I said "sense" and "dance music industry" in the same 
sentence. If I'm willing to pay a premium or some other way of 
reimbursing a record label for their tracks, it's just dumb to not let 
me do so because they said so.

If a DJ spun one of my promo tunes, and I know he didn't get the promo 
from me or my representation, I'd want my label to give said DJ a call 
and chat with him/her in order to get some kind of arrangement going or 
get them to stop playing it altogether. Doesn't this make sense?

Well, it made a lot of sense to some people a while back, and they 
started organizations like BMI and ASCAP to collect royalties because 
there's no way any artist or their representation could possibly keep 
up with the population of the USA. A good idea when it worked for 
people and artists and not lawyers and investors.

These organizations and the artists they represent (by means of the 
RIAA) have made it virtually impossible to operate a music business 
under anyones terms other than theirs. You cannot get good distribution 
without affiliating. The only reason they perpetuate lawsuits and blame 
piracy is because their businesses mean nothing without their 
stranglehold on distribution. The artists they've  created like Britney 
Spears and Linkin Park are only sellable because they're the only thing 
in the store! I WONDER why that is.

The dance music industry has a real opportunity now. To buck the system 
that doesn't support it and become great successes in the process. I'd 
LOVE to run music business that wasn't part of the "system" but it's 
just not going to happen without a lot of help -- overwhelming support 
from every other scene and to stop calling it dance music.

Enough with that rant and back on the blackballing topic: Giving away 
something you've been given in confidence calls for more than 
blackballing -- one should really take legal action at that point. 
You're breaking the law.

F other peoples music. Play originals. Junglists Unite.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Online Music Sharing

i get lots of highbitrate promo mp3s from ppl i send my highbitrate promo 
mp3s too...seems pretty fair to me...most of the kiddies that are going on 
soulseek or whatever to get the hot "dubs" are usually getting 96k copies 
that suck ass cuz they are too noisy to be played over a loud system...SOUR 
might have been a problem a year and a half ago...but SOUR all but 
shutdown...so if you werent down with SOUR then you arent down with SOUR 
now...and if you dont know what SOUR is...dont worry about it.

i have to say that mp3s and online sharing are helping me and my cru as up 
and coming artists...we are having ppl from all over the world give us 
feedback on our stuff...and all of it has been constructive in one way or 
another(even some of what coxxy said was constructive)anyways...how else are 
heads in the uk or europe gonna hear your shit? sure you can mail 
cdr's...but its infinately better for them to just grab the mp3 and give it 
a listen...plus...they cant play the lowbitrate mp3s out cuz of the noise 
issues...so if they want to play your tunes they have to give you tunes...

just my take anyways

Lovin' it...blackballing is truly the cry of every great scene... not saying
I agree with file sharing either.. not in all senses.. depends on the what
the artist wants and if it is "hurting" anyone.. and I know that more times
than not it is. I am just saying blackballing isn't the answer..I don't know
what is but two negatives only create a positive in math. Still love you
Doug..and hey I am trying to bring business your way..even from Trumbell
County..my friend April loved the store..we were there Wednesday (the geek

Realtors fight tooth and nail to keep regular people from getting access to 
the MLS system. Mainly because its the only thing that keeps us needing them 
in the loop.

Blacklisting a DJ who wants to get their material out is in the same vein. A 
drowning victim clutching at a straw with a scare tactic. I hope the people 
who are doing this go the way of Betamax.

The artist is not your enemy.

Well it is pointless to argue it objectively on an internet mailing list.
It's like trying to sell ice at the north pole.

The lady who owns the laundromat I use said it best...

"I haven't bought a cd since we got a cable modem... my son just finds
everything and downloads it for me.


and i have told exact sales figures before time and time again.


And you can ask anyone who works in normal music store "do you have so and
so... i couldn't find it to download online"

and the only thing you are going to hear from someone who file shares is how
this is not true.


just wait and see... the latest step in inpependent dance scene is to black
ball any dj who fileshares from getting promos... gotta love it.... and djs
who are on promo lists are getting taken off them if they get caught playing
pirated material... just a little co-operation among friends.

Blacklisting...

A person who gets a free promo from a record label, rips it to mp3, and
shares it with the entire world.

Those are the people who will get removed from mailing lists, and whose name
gets shared among other people sending out promos.

If you are on a high profile list, where you are one of 500 people who gets
90% of every promo issued..... there is no need to be playing shared files.
You realize that there are djs out there now how just QUIT buying music,
right?   I can name several who make a healthy income off playing dance
music who haven't spent a dime on it in the last year (who certainly aren't
making thier own original music).

There is another side, yes, I agree.   If a record label can't get their
material pressed or available to the public in a timely manner... maybe they
deserve it.  There is definatly room to improve in the system.  CD Maxi's
WILL die within the year, so I think artists will make their material
available for download online.  One of the #1 singles on the billboard club
play chart (head by thunderpuss) reached that position soley by downloads...
no label would pick up the track, so thunderpuss gave it away on their
website.

The only point I am making, is that if you get something promoed to you --
it is your duty (if you like it) to expose it to the world by PLAYING it,
not by burning it for your friends.   You are the dj -- you are helping to
expose the artist and make people want to BUY their music.  If you know
something is not going to be avalable for purchase, maybe there is an
exception.... if you know something is out of print, maybe there is another
exception...  but pirating a fellow electronic artist just to make yourself
popular... ugh.

pangea:  I don't think anyone has a problem with an artist wanting to share
their product for free.  In the house music scene I can say with all
certainty that I wouldn't mind getting advanced copies on cd (if somoene
deemed me  wrothy)... but I would turn around and buy when it is realeased.
My playing it out would create demand, but sharing it with others would be
defeating the purpose.


One other note... Sammy O is producing under the name SOUTHSIDE. He has a
remix of Darkbeat on the Twisted UK 2x12 and a new track this week.   He has
been playing his mix @ Moda from the c5 until the vinyl was available... he
said it made him feel good to buy his own vinyl.   The problem is.... most
people don't feel that way.

Blacklisting...

A person who gets a free promo from a record label, rips it to mp3, and
shares it with the entire world.

Those are the people who will get removed from mailing lists, and whose name
gets shared among other people sending out promos.

If you are on a high profile list, where you are one of 500 people who gets
90% of every promo issued..... there is no need to be playing shared files.
You realize that there are djs out there now how just QUIT buying music,
right?   I can name several who make a healthy income off playing dance
music who haven't spent a dime on it in the last year (who certainly aren't
making thier own original music).

There is another side, yes, I agree.   If a record label can't get their
material pressed or available to the public in a timely manner... maybe they
deserve it.  There is definatly room to improve in the system.  CD Maxi's
WILL die within the year, so I think artists will make their material
available for download online.  One of the #1 singles on the billboard club
play chart (head by thunderpuss) reached that position soley by downloads...
no label would pick up the track, so thunderpuss gave it away on their
website.

The only point I am making, is that if you get something promoed to you --
it is your duty (if you like it) to expose it to the world by PLAYING it,
not by burning it for your friends.   You are the dj -- you are helping to
expose the artist and make people want to BUY their music.  If you know
something is not going to be avalable for purchase, maybe there is an
exception.... if you know something is out of print, maybe there is another
exception...  but pirating a fellow electronic artist just to make yourself
popular... ugh.

pangea:  I don't think anyone has a problem with an artist wanting to share
their product for free.  In the house music scene I can say with all
certainty that I wouldn't mind getting advanced copies on cd (if somoene
deemed me  wrothy)... but I would turn around and buy when it is realeased.
My playing it out would create demand, but sharing it with others would be
defeating the purpose.


One other note... Sammy O is producing under the name SOUTHSIDE. He has a
remix of Darkbeat on the Twisted UK 2x12 and a new track this week.   He has
been playing his mix @ Moda from the c5 until the vinyl was available... he
said it made him feel good to buy his own vinyl.   The problem is.... most
people don't feel that way.

I believe that most of the "bigger" artists sign a multi-album contract.  So
say 5 million for 5 albums.  Then artists get 1 million per no matter on
sales of album. It's mainly a record label's profit.  But then one could
argue if the label doesn't make enough profit, then they pay artist's lower
money or the label may go out of business. It's a touchy situation.........

i never thought so. exclusivity is elitist. when did dance music

see, this is exactly the kind of greatness that can come from easy
filesharing. he brings up another good point, and that has to do
with the playability of low bitrate files. from what ive heard
about final scratch, anything below 160 kbps sounds like asshole.
this provides a pretty good opportunity to differentiate between
copies made and passed around to be listened to as opposed to
being played out by deejays. though i still fail to see what the
gain of having exclusivity over what deejays are playing songs is
aside from a desire by elitists to keep their stuff elite. and
thats just not very good motivation to me.

its not dance music, but the new linkin park album was issued with
a price of 18.99. it contains THIRTY SIX MINUTES OF MUSIC. i hope
that album is totally pillaged online.

see, these are all good valid ways to get exposure without having

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Online Music Sharing

>i never thought so. exclusivity is elitist. when did dance music (which
is extremely populist) become musically elite?

I don't think it's as elite as unorganized. 

>>Enough with that rant and back on the blackballing topic: Giving away 
>>something you've been given in confidence calls for more than
>>blackballing -- one should really take legal action at that point. 
>>You're breaking the law.

>is it? i dont think there are contracts signed for stuff like that
stating what you can and cannot do.

Yes, and yes and no. 

First, yes and no. You're bound by the license agreement that comes with
the media. Not exactly something signed, but it's legal and binding
none-the-less. 

Now for yes, there are written contracts stating what I can and cannot
do, let's give a scenerio of something I do every day, and possibly
something you haven't considered.

Besides all the people that you think of who handle a song, DJ's, end
users, etc., there are a a lot of steps to getting a piece of "content"
to the public. At my job I have access to tons of MPEG's of music videos
for tracks that aren't yet available, they're sitting in a staging area
until the rest of the business plan for the marketing of that song is
ready to go. And yes, a lot of it is "dance music" -- mostly stemming
from the Astralwerks catalog. It would be trivial for me to strip the
audio from the video and have a very high quality version of a song
that's not released yet. 

Besides my role here, there are many other businesses that touch on a
piece of music before it's available to the public. Those tracks are
given in confidence to the licensee, be it a distributor, a radio
station or whatever -- all of those businesses are bound by licensing
contracts. 

There's no way I'd ever jeopardize my employment here that way (it would
be wrong and I need to eat too), but it's obvious that there are people
within companies that are doing exactly that by the amount of
pre-release stuff that hits the internet -- for example, the last Korn
album hit the internet over a month before it hit shelves. 

Now to integrate all that crap into the discussion, if a DJ played a
tune that was leaked by a distributor, a DJ shouldn't be at fault, but
the company that leaked it should be, and THEY'RE the ones that need to
be prosecuted. There are many methods for finding out who did it, and it
wouldn't be all that hard to nail it down to who did it. 

All I'm saying is that it would be wise for record companies to have
contingency plans for if and when things like this happen. Instead, they
go around sueing everyone who touches it. The Korn CD was actually one
of the few examples of lemons being turned into lemonade. Things like
this that could actually be turned into a plus for the label, to sell
more copies or offer a service etc, should really be turned into the way
the business operates in the first place.

But he does make a good point....he'll now forever be "the guy who was charged but not convicted of

hate to burst your bubble on the betamax, but its been used by the pros 
since it came out.  before DV came out, betamax was it, VHS never had a 
chance.  The stupid public? well, Walmart is successful and so are 
televangelists and phone psychics, get the picture?

I don't know where that came from... public hatin I guess.....

VHS won out over beta in the consumer arena because of licensing costs, 
not quality.

sony will never learn their lesson, they price themselfs out of the 
market,  look at the minidisc and sony memory stick.  the licensing was 
too high and everyone found cheaper alternatives (cd-r and compact flash)

Thanks to all that contributed to our Telethon last week!  This year's
Telethon was a huge success and because of your contributions there will
be many improvements to the station such as an even stronger broadcast
signal as well as expanded web streaming capabilities.

For this week's installment of the Beat Matrix, Cara will be treating us
to some progressive house.

If you're a DJ or producer interested on being on the show, contact me
or info@beatmatrix.net

Cheers.

This event brought to you by Experimedia Communications, Molotov Records, 
Headroom Digital, Shift Club Night, and Touch Supper Club.

"This is one of the most significant rosters I've ever observed to grace 
the area and it's even more taunting for me that I couldn't be there to 
support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're truly privileged to be 
offered such rare appearances courtesy of the event producers who're 
credited. Those responsible obviously share an increasingly rare 
enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast with most 'parties'. 
They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an intimate setting, thus 
providing an amazing opportunity to witness these talents whose impact is 
undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all involved and encourage 
anyone who can't stand 'the same' music being played at 'parties' to treat 
yourself to an evening of what is sure to be a great experience and 
hopefully an eye-opening impression on a few of you!"

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Online Music Sharing

Adam,

There are more ways than just buying the music that get people involved with an artist.

For instance (and this is just a hypothetical)...

If I were to drop one of your tracks that I D/L'd from your site...and people are digging it, ask me
about it and I tell them to check you out @ the BBT...

Your night is more successful, drawing some more business for the bar and for you and your crew, you
have a more successful night. True, you see no immediate profits, but you also don't have the vinyl
out yet, do you?? (If I'm wrong, let me know...I want some of that shit on 12")

Is that such a bad thing??

m.

i think this is already happening.  the problem is, is its hard to catch.  i
wont mention any names but ive seen people throw down unauthorised promos
and they had everyone thinking that it was authorised.  its your word
against theirs.  now, i have freinds that do this and use my final scratch
to do it, but i think there is a grey area with a free gig.  personally, i
do download the unrealeased shit but i never will play them with out
permission.  plus i still spin 75% vinyl even though i own this technology.
seeings as how i am a producer and would like to sell my singles, i have to
be this way.  others simply dont give a fuck and you wont be able to make
them care no matter how hard you try.  the way i look at it is: selling hard
copies of music is going to die, musicians that make there living this way
will have to find another way to make money.  is this a bad thing???  it is
for somepeople but what are you going to do about it?

i dont think there is anything wrong with discussing this matter again.  ill
read the replies.

Subject: {pb-cle} This Thursday@Havana - D-CYPOL

THURSDAYS@HAVANA
Thursday 04.17.03

[DC SPACE] - opening up the night with his deep vibe.  Did you know that 
Brother Mike DJs for us on Saturdays too? ... strictly on the jazz side ... 
check it out.

[D-CYPOL] - Seattle - www.Ruffneckplayazcrew.com

Many of you should remember this guy from back in the day - playing Happy 
Hardcore and Jazzy Jungle at many parties here in the 'burgh in the late 
90's - Teaming up with 1.8.7. for some crazy sets ...

D-Cypol has been a turntablist for 8 years and has also played at numerous 
raves nation wide. He's been involved in writing his own music for the last 
2 years and has thrown 4 of his own events. He's contributed to many free 
renegade parties as well as held various club residencies and radio slots. 
Locally (Seattle), he's played the Baltic Room, Watertown, Contour, Steel 
Sky, and The Empire. He's been recognized for his talents in URB magazine on 
3 separate occassions as well as other various dance magazines. The Gold 
Medalists is the stage name for the live act performed by D-Cypol and fellow 
producer Baron Von Beck. Their dynamic performance includes original tracks 
mixed with DJ cuts, live druming, sampling, and vocals.

I've had the pleasure of knowing this guy for a long time.  He recently got 
married this past weekend so this thursday will be sort of a post wedding 
celebration for him and his new wife.  Crazy.

NO COVER / 21+ / I.D. Required <---
$2 'lings and $3 Sangrias
Back Patio Open!
and free shots @ ~12:30 (first come first serve)

SATURDAY MAY 3rd, 2003

DJ SMASH
(BLUE NOTE, NYC)
www.bluenote.com
www.djsmash.net

DJ Smash's current involvement as conceptual director and producer with Blue Note Records only hints the range of his experience and talent for bringing together diverse elements within the realm of Dance music.

Starting his journey into sound in the late 70's as Disco swept NYC (and the world), Smash found his calling via the turntables and the inventionof the 12" single. Being too young to gain entry to nightclubs, his first gigs were blockparties and basement jams (featuring the occasional dj battle) in his hometown of Brooklyn. With the emergence of rap, his skills were sharpened while working with local neighborhood MCs and the relationships soon evolved to producing tracks and "battle tapes" for various MC contests and demos. 

As the rap game became more commercial, competitive and violent, Smash sought out other musical forms to express his diverse taste and creativity. House music was the next major musical influence and inspired him to become more prolific in the studio working with singers and musicians in replacement of rappers. After shopping numerous demos the payoff was being signed to the trend setting dance label Sleeping Bag in the late eighties. He produced several songs for other artists on the label but longed to release his own records. As that was 
about to become a reality, Sleeping Bag went under which spurred him to take his untried sounds elsewhere. 

As a result, his first releases as an artist were for the ground breaking, New York City underground dance label Nu Groove Records. "Cutting my first 3 records with no censorship or musical discrimination from a label was such a blessing to me" says Smash. "Karen and Frank (Mendez) were risk takers and way ahead of there time for a New York label. Being able to learn the business as I went along yet being given the respect and freedom to find my own way musically really planted the bug in my head to start my own label like I saw Kenny Dope and Bobby Konders do with them". 

After Nu Groove dissolved in 1991, Smash teamed up with an investor and started Eightball Records producing the first 5 releases under different monikers like Jazz Not Jazz and Jazzy Grooves while signing and co-producing Napoleon Solo's cult funk hit "Come On Girl" as well as producer Fred Jorio's Lectroluv Project. 

After creative conflicts with their Eightball partner, Smash and new partner Asia Love founded a new imprint specifically focused on the growing global phenomenon of the 'Acid'Jazz and Trip Hop movement. They called it New Breed Records and it featured a diverse roster of talent from around the globe. For most of the artists, namely Lisa Shaw, The Prunes, Hustlers of Culture, Peanut Butter Wolf, Tommy Gurerro and Khromozome Project, it was their first record deal and a testing ground for new and unusual ideas. The label had a six year run (1991-1997) as one of the premiere Acid Jazz and break beat imprints out of New York with a focus on signing and nurturing talent rather than licensing in tracks, which most other labels chasing the trend chose to do. 

With over 30 remixes and 75 original released productions to his credit, working with the likes of Roy Ayers, Herbie Hancock, Towa Tei, Guru and Donald Byrd among others, Smash has traversed the creative boundaries of the music business with clever and innovative appropriations of differing styles, at times blurring the lines of what's considered house, hip hop, jazz, reggae, dub, and funk. His legendary NYC residencies have included Save The Robots, Nell's, and Giant Step as well as numerous guest stints at various bars,lounges, clubs and festivals internationally.

forgotten by those who were there. One of the

respected record stores in the country, The Groove

Frankie Bones, Jes is a favorite amongst music lovers.
Success has been a part of Jes from the beginning.
With his long list of accomplishments, Jes is not only
striving to better himself, but has dedicated much of
his time to helping the electronic music scene
progress. Jes has not only helped put Rockford, IL on
the dance music map, but has also helped promote the
Midwestern Rave Scene.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

April                         WRUW pledge drive                   Cleveland

I just wanted to let you guys know that the annual WRUW-FM 91.1 Telethon
is starting this week.  Please support the station and the Beat Matrix
by calling in with your pledges (preferably during our show on Monday
night). 
 
Reasons why you should support WRUW:
-WRUW is completely commercial free and brings you the latest music of
all varieties.
-The Telethon is the only time of the year that the station generates
revenue and it bases its budget off of its telethon earnings.
-The money you donate will go towards maintaining and upgrading
equipment at the station.  Past telethon's helped to fund the power
increase to 15,000 watts so that it could bring the music to you in high
fidelity audio!  There are even more ways to increase the station's
audio quality and can only be achieved with the community's support.
-Money donated also goes towards purchasing the latest CDs so that we
can play them for YOU.
-The live web stream can also be improved with your support!
-The Beat Matrix is the only radio show in Cleveland that brings you a
different guest DJ every week for free!  If you bought a mix CD every
week it would cost you over $800 a year.  A small donation to the
station goes a long way towards improving the ways we expose local
talent and bring new music to the community!  Even if you donated $40
dollars to the station, it would come out to ~ 75 cents per mix set.
-You can even donate with a credit card which gives us the money
instantly!
 
As a thank you for your donation of forty dollars, WRUW will send you
one of several nice electronic music compilations of the music we play
on the Beat Matrix.   If you are able to donate seventy-five dollars,
you will have a choice of premiums including a WRUW sweatshirt or polo
shirt.  If you aren't able to afford forty or seventy-five dollars,
donate what you can.  Whatever you are able to donate, it is important
that you call and show your support for the Beat Matrix.  

In addition, listeners who donate will be entered into a drawing for a
copy of Techno Rebels - a rare, well-done, and accurate documentary on the
global rise of electronic music.
 
Remember, this is the one time during the year that you can show your
support!
 
The Beat Matrix runs every Monday night from 10:30pm - 12:30am.  Please
call in with your donations 216.368.2208.

This event brought to you by Experimedia Communications, Molotov Records, 
Headroom Digital, Shift Club Night, and Touch Supper Club.

"This is one of the most significant rosters I've ever observed to grace 
the area and it's even more taunting for me that I couldn't be there to 
support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're truly privileged to be 
offered such rare appearances courtesy of the event producers who're 
credited. Those responsible obviously share an increasingly rare 
enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast with most 'parties'. 
They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an intimate setting, thus 
providing an amazing opportunity to witness these talents whose impact is 
undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all involved and encourage 
anyone who can't stand 'the same' music being played at 'parties' to treat 
yourself to an evening of what is sure to be a great experience and 
hopefully an eye-opening impression on a few of you!"

All Ages Show $7 8PM sharp

all in all one of the lineups i've been looking forward to seeing more 
than
anything.  doormouse may be most known for his antics, but his music
is just as smashing. otto von schirach is one of the most weird, 
innovative,
and fun producers around, the punk king of glitch.  and baseck
has pretty much crushed everybody who hears him play...insane scratch and
cut skills applied to breakcore.  with locals impercept doing a live set,
and adam bomb dropping a set of original pittsburgh d&b...should be
hot all around.

Since this is an outdoor event the only thing we ask of you (aside from 
comming and making this party a blast) is that you respect the 
property,this means try to put your cigarette butts where they belong (not 
on the ground,unless you want to help us pick them up in the morning),and 
also if you`re handed a flier that you don`t want,either tell the person 
handing them out you don`t want it,or take it and put it in the 
trash,there will be plenty of bags around,same goes for water bottles and 
anything else you might throw on the ground.This is a beautiful venue 
surrounded by a state park,so try to keep everything nice looking. This 
venue is in the middle of no where and all permits have or will be taken 
care of,so this event is sure to go off without any problems.

No drugs,Alcohol,Markers,Weapons or anything else that might get you or us 
in trouble and the event shut down.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)

The time is 1200 hours the date is 10/18/03 and the location is Pittsburgh 
PA.  The company that brought you a revolutionary event is now back to 
bring you the much-anticipated sequel to a phenomenon that began 1 year 
ago.  We gave much thought about how we could improve our event from last 
year and we decided to eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes 
brutal outdoors so we moved the legacy that started it all indoors into a 
beautiful large facility located in the heart of the steel city. We wanted 
to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of kind 
superstar import car event.  Even though we wont be racing vehicles this 
year there will be tons of fun, and many different creative things going 
on.  I will have to keep you in suspense about most of the activities that 
we have planned until the time is right but I will give you brief taste of 
what is in store for SO2.  Picture an event like you have never witnessed 
before lights, visuals, sound, lasers, dancers, djs, mcs, models, free 
stuff, contests, entertainers, many different automobile divisions, tons 
of cash prizes, a outdoor portion and indoor portion, and much more TBA!  
If you thought that Street Outlawz was as good as gets you wont believe 
your eyes when SO2 hits the city. So prepare yourself for an event that 
will once again go down into the history of the Steel City!


ELECTRONIC MUSIC:
	(These are only a few of the major headliners that will be 
featured at the event please stay posted to our website 
www.steelcityracing.com for more detailed information)

DRUM N BASS:

FREAKY FLOW w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
his outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its not 
magazines then its live TV the Freaky Flow combination has truly been 
just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!




UFO! (Drum N Bass)
(Phracktel/ Phunckateck/ Phylum Recordings-SF)

The aliens are coming! The aliens are coming!  Please dont be alarmed by 
the name the aliens are not really coming.  However this is just one more 
incredible piece of talent that we are bringing to you for SO2!  This guy 
is unbelievable on the turntables he his mostly recognized for his 
extraordinary track selection of his own original work!  We are sure that 
whenever he drops his dubs the dance floor will be screaming for more.  If 
you hadnt had the chance to see this west coast legend then allow 
yourself the time to hit the dance floor at SO2 for an unforgettable 
musical experience!

AND MORE TBA!

HAPPY HARDCORE!

RYAN MATTHEWS-(Trance/Progressive Trance)
If its trance that you love then you wont want to miss this outstanding 
Pittsburgh native by the name of Ryan Matthews.  This young superstar 
tears up the dance floor every time he hits the decks playing an 
outstanding selection of emotional and heart pounding trance that leaves 
you in a state of pure euphoria.  

E-DITTY- (Trance)
The dark haired maniac is back again hes the player hater that you all 
love to hate!  But we keep bringing him back because of his prestigious 
mixing skills and loving attitude towards the music that he spins.  If you

special set!

fantastic very rare all live performance.  This is another do not miss 
performer that adds to our obvious love for electronic music!

TWO STEP

Cheshire w/Mc Gravity-(2-step/Warren OH)
We gave much thought to this and we decided to choose one performer to 
strictly represent the 2 step scene and this performer is no other than 
the one the only DJ Cheshire! Chris a.k.a Cheshire is a one of kind 
performer his smooth intellectual attitude gives his style a unique 
separation that blows up dance floors every time he hits the stage.  The 
love of his music is obvious with the energy that he displays every time 
he drops another funky beat. We couldnt get enough of this incredible

3 Thumbs Up!........................my favorite....the mongrel cat came home
holding half a head
proceeded to show it off
to all his new found friends
he said i been where i liked
i slept with who i like
she ate me up for breakfast
she screwed me in a vice
but now
i don't know why
i feel so tongue-tied
i sat in the cupboard
and wrote it down real neat 
they were cheering and waving
cheering and waving
twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
but it got edited fucked up
strangled beaten up
used in a photo in time magazine
buried in a burning black hole in devon
i dont know why i 
feel so tongue-tied
dont know why
i feel
so skinned alive.
my thoughts are misguided and a little naive
i twitch and i salivate like with myxomatosis
you should put me in a home or you should put me down
i got myxomatosis
i got myxomatosis
yeah no one likes a smart ass but we all like stars
but that wasn't my intention, i did it for a reason
it must have got mixed up
strangled beaten up
i got myxomatosis 
i got myxomatosis

proceeded to show it off
to all his new found friends
he said i been where i liked
i slept with who i like
she ate me up for breakfast
she screwed me in a vice
but now
i don't know why
i feel so tongue-tied
i sat in the cupboard
and wrote it down real neat 
they were cheering and waving
cheering and waving
twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
but it got edited fucked up
strangled beaten up
used in a photo in time magazine
buried in a burning black hole in devon
i don't know why i 
feel so tongue-tied
don't know why
i feel
so skinned alive.
my thoughts are misguided and a little naive
i twitch and i salivate like with myxomatosis
you should put me in a home or you should put me down
i got myxomatosis
i got myxomatosis
yeah no one likes a smart ass but we all like stars
but that wasn't my intention, i did it for a reason
it must have got mixed up
strangled beaten up
i got myxomatosis 
i got myxomatosis
i don't know why i
feel so tongue-tied

Subject: {pb-cle} outboard effects...

hey gang.

first, apologies to those of you getting this twice.

second, my question:

can anyone make a suggestion(s) for outboard effects in the "affordable" range??

something akin to the kaoss pad, where there are a variety of presets and are fairly easy to
manipulate and tweak while dj'ing or running a PA rig.

i want to get the new kaoss pad, but don't want to lay down the $200+ right at this moment... i just
want to get something to start messing with the sends/returns on my mixer to beef up my performance
of original tracks...

thanks in advance.

Mark

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} outboard effects...

i don't think you'll get much cheaper than a kaoss pad, especially hands 
on easy tweaking, you can find some old guitar rack efx units on the 
cheap and alot of those take midi continuous controllers.   you can then 
use something to control it.  the X15 pedalboards i think by ART look 
good for that, or just any of the knob boxes out there.  doepfer, 
midiman, frostwave maybe?  theres alot anyhow.

I just wanted to say thanks to Moose for a great night.  It was awesome to 
see so many old faces.  What a load of Pittsburgh folk!  Lovely.  

Also, thanks for so many cheers during the naughty nighty contest.  The win 
was a really pleasant surprise!  The enthusiasm was much appreciated.  I'm 
definitely going to enjoy some of those goofy prizes.

I do think my boyfriend (Bish) brought some heavy competition with that red 
number he debuted.  So sexy.

Enjoy your weekend,

Fame Leah

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} dj's in pjs

Last night was a blast... It was great seeing everyone (Leah, Bish, Josh, 
Trout, Trish, Cos, Jessica, Allison (2 of them), Doug, Zone, Moose, Richie, 
Melanie, Meghan, and last but not least, Ray!).

I actually danced last night, which is something that NO one should have to 
see (HEHE), and I got to see a "bit" more skin that I had expected, which is 
ALWAYS good! LOL. There were some pretty amazing "pajamas" in that place 
(yep, I admit it, I was JEALOUS!).

Honestly, ALL of the djs last night played wonderfully, in my opinion: 
Johnny V, Moose, Clevr, Doug, and Zone. It was a great way to bring in my 
birthday today, so thanks so much to everyone who was a part of last 
night... I'm still recovering, but seeing as today is "my day", I had better 
snap out of it pretty quickly!

See you all (or some of you?) at Abasso tonight!

-Casey-
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME~!!! YAYY!! :-)

Yes indeed.  This was GOOD TIMES :)

I felt so awful after dinner (food poisoning of some sort) and the drive
down was miserable, but once I got there and got a few drinks in me, and the
music kicked in -- it was all good.

Sorry I missed Johnny V and only got to catch half of Moose's set... but I
was loving every minute of it.  My second time listening to a full Clever
set was not a dissapointment, and Zone definately took the party to the next
level (with a little help from the contest getting everyone hot and
bothered).

It was also good to see Josh, get reaquainted with Leah, and of course
Wayne, Casey, Meghan, and Ray... always a pleasure to be around you guys.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR:  Anyone have a use for a P 133 computer?

OK, this computer has been collecting dust long enough.  I would 
donate it to a school or something, but it's so freaking slow though. 
 So I'm giving it away to anyone that wants it.  Here's the specs:

IBM PC330 desktop
Pentium 133 MHz processor
32 MB RAM
24x cd-rom drive by Teac
1.2 GB Hard Drive (IBM Model# IBM-DJAA-31270)
Sound Blaster 32 PNP (ISA Model)
Matrox Millenium II 4 MB PCI video card (Model #MIL2P/4N)

I'll also include the original keyboard, a three button mouse, and a 
power cable.  I suppose you could use it for a really basic word 
processor (by basic, I mean word perfect for dos type basic).  I 
guess you could also put 98 on it and use it as a print server, 
although it's a little bulky and noisy, although it is free.

I'm in Streetsboro (near Trout, if any of you know where he's at).  
It is the next city north of Kent, south of Aurora (Six Flags), and 
south-east or so from Twinsburg.  I really don't want to ship it 
because it will probably be a little costly.

If I don't hear back from anyone, I'm going to tear it down and put 
it in the trash (maybe I'll have a use for a 1.2 gig drive sometime, 
and I can never have too many extra cd-roms (especially since my one 
file server only has a 6x or 8x in it)).

email me if interested, vr@vrillusions.com

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Have any of you ever watched fox news?  Well then I'm sure that most of you are familiar with Mr. Bill OReilly.  Come on.  The NO SPIN ZONE!  He is on at 8p.m. every night, (m-f) and that segment can be seen again every night at 11p.m. Well if you know him then you know that Bill is pretty much a black and white kind of man.  What is right is right, and what is wrong is wrong.  However, he MISSES a lot of the GRAY area.  And it isn't just a tiny bit of gray that this man (and people like him) are missing.  This is a huge gray.  How many times does OReilly say something along the lines of "Correct me if I'm wrong" or "Well I'm right, so tell me if I'm not"  he does a lot, and 9 out of 10 people do, but he gets out of it and away with it because he is smart and can think quick to go back to his point, as if they didn't even say anything.  If a man comes on his show who is an expert in child abuse, OReilly would most likely try to say that he know more about it than the expert did.  I like The OReilly Factor, actually but watching him and others like him has led me to see things such as... Most Conservatives generally do not know a lot about the back ground and the "gray" information.  That is what matters.. How many people that are for this war do you think believe Bush about how he wants to "free" the iraqi people?  A lot probably.  Because they DON'T know things like Saddam used to be one of our allies, etc.. Most of them pick the easy way out.  When bad thoughts have to be thought out throughly, like reasons why we shouldn't go to war, most people don't want to think about the bad. I support this statement from thee following example:I am sick of hearing about all the bad stuff going in with the war on the news, like the pow's, the poor girl who got shot in the foot (and probably raped---but she won't tell the public) etc.. because it is just "sick" and it makes me sick to my stomach.  We shouldn't even be over there anyways.So people don't like thinking about "bad" thoughts generally, and a lot of the GRAY that conservatives don't know about is bad stuff about our government.. example... I will bet you money that the government pays news stations to have more right wing people on.  To not give all the information.  That way, it looks just. It all makes me sick.

I think that there is no way that George Bush sent those troops in for the reasons he is telling the american people. I know that it is for oil equaling a lot of green bills for george-y.  I think this "iraqi freedom"  is really   "operation (first step towards) u.s. take over".  It makes me sick.  Bush is a lying bastard.   Does anyone know about El Salvador?  And how we were supporting that cruel leader?  Those people TRIED to free themselves, and we helped stop them!  So many people died.  Rent the movie / dvd called SALVADOR.  A lot of people don't know what really went on.  Our government pays people money to help prevent us from knowing. We supported Iraq when they attacked Iran.  I mean, god damn! Yea.... Bush is playing this game like chess.  He doesn't give a fuck.They needed 9.11 as a move so that some people would be for the war so we could "get the bad guys". It is to bad that Saddam was bad to his people, and that he wasn't a Gondi, because then it would really show Bush for what he is doing to those uninformed people that think this war is just. Why the hell didn't he try or his dad to "save the Iraqi's" then?  Why aren't they over in Cuba saving those people from castro? Yea, exactly.  Besides, why do you think they went in before the UN could vote?  Duh!  Because then BUSH would have to share HIS oil.He is happy France and German y aren't supporting it, because then they would also have a say on the oil, and he wants it all for him. Tax Cuts------hmmmm!  All that shit really is, is for the people who invest a great deal of their money, but because of Enron, it makes them a little "shaky" in investing, because they don't want a company they invest in, to screw them over like Enron.  So, by tax cutting he is telling the rich people "there now you have a little more money you can play with, to try to invest in again, don't worry it won't screw you over like Enron"  Example, smaller companies invest in larger companies, and then it goes to the oil.  That goes to Bush. Think of oil as liquid gold. Really Bush doesn't give a fuck about abortion, he only said it because of all the go head, die hard, god people who are against them; he knew it would win votes.  That lying mother fucker! He doesn't give a shit about anyone's lifestyle in other countries.  He wants their oil.   duh.     He only cares that America takes over, and the first step is to gain control of the oil fields.  But uh-oh, no we have to watch our backs.  And use the excuse that others are being bad (like 9.11)  ((I'll bet BUSH had shit to do with 9.11))  Why the FUCK weren't any of those 4 planes intercepted????????? And the one that landed in Pennsylvania, had to be up in the air at least an hour, which gave them plenty of time to shoot it down))!  Fuck you bush! So.. know we watch our backs, and kill anyone who is trying to get in our oil.  We need to be in control, so that we can have all the oil.  So that no one can fuck with us. Yeah, I do feel bad for those Iraqi's.  But, how many countries are against this war?  How many people protested?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Bush got lucky with 9.11 because he can have someone write him a speech that sounds okay that says 
"We need to get those terrorists"  Oh kiss it bitch bush!  You knew it was coming, and your glad it happened so that you can now finally go in and get that oil, and move shit around like pieces on a chess board.  The Skull theory?  Anyone ever heard of it? Yeah. fuck this war and fuck the supporters. If the people who sign up for the military, and did sign up knew ANYTHING about Salvador they would think again, actually they wouldn't.  Their answer would be a flat out no, because of how fucked up our government was.  (and it still is)

Patriotism?  What about large corporations that do business off shore tax exempt, yet, they live in the United States and reap all the benefits?  How patriotic is that?? They have these big companies, and go far enough out they don't pay taxes.

> I think that there is no way that George Bush sent those troops in for the
reasons he is telling the american people. I know that it is for oil
equaling a lot of green bills for george-y.  I think this "iraqi freedom"
is really   "operation (first step towards) u.s. take over".  It makes me
sick.  Bush is a lying bastard.   Does anyone know about El Salvador?  And
how we were supporting that cruel leader?  Those people TRIED to free
themselves, and we helped stop them!  So many people died.  Rent the movie /
dvd called SALVADOR.  A lot of people don't know what really went on.  Our
government pays people money to help prevent us from knowing. We supported
Iraq when they attacked Iran.  I mean, god damn! Yea.... Bush is playing
this game like chess.  He doesn't give a fuck.They needed 9.11 as a move so
that some people would be for the war so we could "get the bad guys". It is
to bad that Saddam was bad to his people, and that he wasn't a Gondi,
because then it would really show Bush for what he is doing to those
uninformed people that think this war is just. Why the hell didn't he try or
his dad to "save the Iraqi's" then?  Why aren't they over in Cuba saving
those people from castro? Yea, exactly.  Besides, why do you think they went
in before the UN could vote?  Duh!  Because then BUSH would have to share
HIS oil.He is happy France and German y aren't supporting it, because then
they would also have a say on the oil, and he wants it all for him. Tax
Cuts------hmmmm!  All that shit really is, is for the people who invest a
great deal of their money, but because of Enron, it makes them a little
"shaky" in investing, because they don't want a company they invest in, to
screw them over like Enron.  So, by tax cutting he is telling the rich
people "there now you have a little more money you can play with, to try to
invest in again, don't worry it won't screw you over like Enron"  Example,
smaller companies invest in larger companies, and then it goes to the oil.
That goes to Bush. Think of oil as liquid gold. Rea
> lly Bush doesn't give a fuck about abortion, he only said it because of
all the go head, die hard, god people who are against them; he knew it would
win votes.  That lying mother fucker! He doesn't give a shit about anyone's
lifestyle in other countries.  He wants their oil.   duh.     He only cares
that America takes over, and the first step is to gain control of the oil
fields.  But uh-oh, no we have to watch our backs.  And use the excuse that
others are being bad (like 9.11)  ((I'll bet BUSH had shit to do with 9.11))
Why the FUCK weren't any of those 4 planes intercepted????????? And the one
that landed in Pennsylvania, had to be up in the air at least an hour, which
gave them plenty of time to shoot it down))!  Fuck you bush! So.. know we
watch our backs, and kill anyone who is trying to get in our oil.  We need
to be in control, so that we can have all the oil.  So that no one can fuck
with us. Yeah, I do feel bad for those Iraqi's.  But, how many countries are
against this war?  How many people protested?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Bush got
lucky with 9.11 because he can have someone write him a speech that sounds
okay that says
> "We need to get those terrorists"  Oh kiss it bitch bush!  You knew it was
coming, and your glad it happened so that you can now finally go in and get
that oil, and move shit around like pieces on a chess board.  The Skull
theory?  Anyone ever heard of it? Yeah. fuck this war and fuck the
supporters. If the people who sign up for the military, and did sign up knew
ANYTHING about Salvador they would think again, actually they wouldn't.
Their answer would be a flat out no, because of how fucked up our government
was.  (and it still is)

You're crazier than that other guy that there is no OT list for. FOR
REAL. 

I can't even understand what you're saying. "gay ass government"? WTF is
this all about? Have my Senators started singing showtunes? Are they
like Richard Simmons or something? Do they throw parades and march down
the street yelling slogans for and about their sexual orientation? Have
they started collecting precious moments figurines?

Tell me this, how do you destroy a mountain and replace it with a
shopping mall? Is this some sort of new technology I'm not familiar
with? If so, why didn't we use it in Afghanistan. Oh, it must be that
you can only REPLACE a mountain with a mall, not just erase the
mountain. 

I've got news for you, it snows in Hawai'i all the time. Yup. You see,
Hawai'i was formed from volcanic disruptions, and therefore is
mountainous territory. Mauna Kea is nearly 13,800 feet! You can actually
go skiing on it if weather permits.

There's lots of mountains in Hawai'i -- which explain the high number of
astronomical observitories in the high mountains there. You know,
Astronomy,  something you would call "witchcraft" or "the devils work".

Now you see what the big deal is :)

Abbasso is definately a cool place.  Its not too loud, the people are fun,
and its like family.  There is something magical about it where I always run
into people I know and like.  I can't say enough good things about Abbasso,
and I still haven't made it down to check out open tables.  Not to mention
drinks are priced fairly, there's no cover (except saturday afterhours), and
the music is always good.

Yeah man...it's the new style. I came in and Ian Mariano
was spinnin, which is always a pleasant suprise. Then
Meghan, Darbe, and Jason tagged every 1/2 which is a cool
concept. Switchin flavas is good. 

I really think people will be lining up out the door by the
time this summer is over. My only suggestion is don't be
afraid to get some break beatz and a lil' D & B in there
every once in a while. 

Great job Amy!

Ha...it's so cool to hear others loving on Abbasso (So, I don't think I'm crazy for spending too much time down there)  I've equated it with the feeling of being at a close friends private house party at times...looks like a bar (though a really nice one), but feels like a family room---nice, comfy, and with friendly familiar faces around.   I keep hearing of so many people that went down this weekend...wish I didn't have other obligations.  Oh well, this weekend...(Tyler, if you read this...you're playing Sat. right?)

 We're startin' to try to branch out a bit...we had
 still life in a few weeks ago to close the night,
 and
 he did a great job...i wouldn't mind hearing more of
 the melodic D&B he was tossing down.  Occasionally
 some of the core crew will throw down breaks, but we
 could use more breaks in there, i agree...perhaps we
 should get zone/clever up from the 'burgh sometime
 this summer.  anyway, 'yiss cool to hear more folk
 from this board are checkin' things out...hope to
 meet
 some more of you in the coming weeks.
 
 Peace,
 Jamie
 
 ...BTW, yes, avalon, i'll be spinning this sat
 (probably the middle set...joseph's opening, i don't
 know about a closer yet...gotta talk to naps)

I've equated it with the > feeling of being at a close friends private house 
party at times.

Yeah, it reminds me of my Sherman St. setup, except the 
beer is more expensive and there's no windows to peep
out of :]

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Abasso thanx

I really want to get some time off of work to check out Abasso. That drive 
to Ohio kills me when I have to wake up, and I would like to stay late and 
have some drinks without thinking about a 4 hour drive home.

I will, however, definitely be there for Thomas Penton May 3rd. I hope I get 
to meet some of the Abasso crew, and some Ohiolanders as well.

peace!

Okay, without a doubt I will be at Abbasso on Friday (whether or not my man

definitely bring copies of my sunrise mix.

Subject: 	Please help whereveRadio

	
From: 	Thomas Mondell <mondell@getsuper.com>
To: 	Thomas ***Mondell <mondell@fyi.net>



Hi,
Let me begin by stating that I'm not at all comfortable with what I'm 
about to ask but sometimes it takes a crisis situation to stimulate a 
crucial decision. That critical time has occurred here at 
whereveradio.com <http://whereveradio.com/>. Asking for listener support 
was never a part of our initial business plan. Back in 2000 we thought 
that generating operating funds from advertisers would not be a problem 
but then the bottom dropped out of the economy and web advertising 
became a low priority for many companies. Although, for now, the 
opportunities to gain advertising funds has all but disappeared, the 
number of listeners has not. That is good and bad. whereveradio.com 
<http://whereveradio.com/> needs and wants as many listeners as 
possible, but it takes alot more bandwidth to make room for all the 
listener traffic. It's almost as if we are punished for becoming more 
popular! Bandwidth cost alot of money. Now, there are plenty of other 
expenses that I could mention, but I'm trying to keep this as simple as 
possible. So, it's crisis time and in order to pay for the upgrades 
required *whereveRadio *is asking for your dedicated financial support. 
Hopefully, this will only be a temporary request but for the immediate 
future we need your support in order to continue streaming the music 
that we all feel so passionate about. Just ask yourself one question, 
"Is whereveRadio an important part of my lifestyle?". If it is, then 
supporting it should not be an issue. What _would_ be an issue is 
replacing it if it were to end. We are asking for minimum donations of 
$10 per month. More would be great, but that's the minimum. Some of you 
can afford more than others based on your income levels, etc. Once the 
contributions start to arrive we can begin to create incentives for you 
but for now all we can offer you is the music and some 
recognition.....and ain't that what it's all about? Let's make this a 
pleasant situation. If you have some good ideas on how to do 
this.....send me a feedback message. Good ideas are always welcome.
 
Please send your contributions to:
*whereveRadio.com*
*P.O. Box 6010*
*Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, USA*
*16117*
 
Thanks for your support, and most of all, thanks for listening!
 
Sincerely,
Tom Mondell

RESIDUAL RECORDINGS + HEADROOM DIGITAL ... present

PROCEED FEATURING DABRYE

Why should i go?  Because this may be the dopest show Columbus has seen for
a minute.  You can  tell your grandchildren you were there!

Featuring:

Dabrye
Ghostly International. Eastern Development. Detroit.
Dabrye is just one alias of Ghostly International recording artist Tadd
Mullinix, who shifts through various guises with a refreshing competency and
sophistication.  His Dabrye LPs, "One/Three" and "Instrmntl," the latter for
Scott Herren aka Prefuse 73's Eastern Developments label, brought him
critical acclaim in the hip-hop underground from notable figures such as Jay
Dee and Jurassic Five.  His techno-ready James Cotton moniker won him fans
like Techno and House luminaries Matthew Herbert and Laurent Garnier.  The
classical structure and melodies of his debut full-length under his
birth-name "Winking Makes a Face" and the 2002 follow-up "Panes" turned the
chin-stroking IDM connoisseurs on their heads.  With a new Dabrye LP for
Ghostly International due out in late 2003, Tadd Mullinix looks ready to
bring Dabrye into the elite of forward-thinking and groundbreaking new
artists.

Twine / Phase4
Ghostly International. Bip Hop. Hefty Records. Cleveland.

Soup aka Servo
Beta Bodega. Etihad. Phonophorum. Columbus

Thomas James
Residual. Penetrate. OSU.

Subject: {pb-cle} Penetrate (c-bus) feat. DOMU // UK

Reminder This friday
Get there early this gonna be da JAM!!!

HEADROOM DIGITAL and RESIDUAL RECORDINGS presents PENETRATE, a monthly
series of events dedicated to showcasing the emerging UK Brokenbeat sound,
featuring DJ performances from international and national headliners.
PENETRATE occurs the last Friday of each month at the Standard Lounge.
Date:
Friday, April 25th at the Standard Lounge in Columbus / 303 S. Front St.
10pm-2:30am / Cover: $5 / 18 and over

Penetrate is a series of events dedicated to showcasing the emerging UK
Broken Beat genre through performances by internationally and nationally
renown acts.  Broken Beat is the newest addition to the plethora of
sub-genres that fall under the broader electronic music genre.  While
definitely related to and influenced by the other styles, Broken Beat also
known as Future Jazz or Nu Jazz, differentiates itself from the pack by
fusing jazz rhythmic patterns, and improvisational composition with organic
and electronic elements.  The origins of the genre can be traced back to the
late 90's in West London where a handful of talented and respected
electronic musicians began to break the mold and produce music that defied
categorization.  Led by luminaries such as Jazzanova, Giles Peterson, and
the Bugz in the Attic collective, the genre began to take root and garner
international attention.  For April's Penetrate, we are pleased to bring
Jazzanova Compost, Archive, Reinforced, and Residual recording artist Domu.
An innovator of the Broken Beat sound and one of the busiest artists in the
industry, Domu will be coming all the way from London, UK for his first ever
North American appearance.  Opening DJ sets will be provided by Residual
Recordings label-heads and Penetrate resident DJ's Titonton Duvant and
Thomas James.

TIMESLOTS

Domu London Uk  12am to 2:30 am
Titonton Duvante 11pm to 12 am
Thomas James 10 pm  to 11pm

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Tonight @ Pub I.G.

Live is da bomb! Everything I do gets filtered through it somehow. It's
especially useful for recording stuff from Reason via Rewire. The
Abletons hate me (with reason), but it's probably one of the most
intuitive loop based programs around. There's a demo of the program you
can download from their site (www.ableton.com) if you feel like learning
about it. I've found it's really addicitive, but the flaws will drive
you insane, and those mf'ers are SLOW on releasing patches. 

I'll be doing a show in Bloomington Indiana (info to follow closer to
the date, not the thing I emailed ya about Lukas) on 7/5 where you'll be
able to watch what I'm up to with Live/Reason on a projector over my
head. I'll be playing twice that night, once with the Live/Reason combo
(acid/techno) and once with NI Traktor (dnb vs. modal/free jazz). The
projector should be pretty interesting, I think that a lot of times
people who are "laptop musicians" often just look like they're checking
their email on stage; that should provide evidence to the contrary. 

Like I said, details to follow sometime closer to the show, should be a
lot of fun though. Bringing 5 PC's (possibly more) with 2 game pads a
piece that I've setup with a linux distro that boots right into a MAME
manager. There should be an area for that and some other fun that will
be kept a secret for now.

-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Fri Apr 25                        PENETRATE                        Columbus

HEADROOM DIGITAL and RESIDUAL RECORDINGS presents PENETRATE, a
monthly series of events dedicated to showcasing the emerging UK
Brokenbeat sound, featuring DJ performances from international
and national headliners. PENETRATE occurs the last Friday of
each month at the Standard Lounge.

Date:
Friday, April 25th at the Standard Lounge in Columbus
303 S.Front St. 10pm-2:30am / Cover: $5 / 18 and over

Penetrate is a series of events dedicated to showcasing the
emerging UK Broken Beat genre through performances by
internationally and nationally renowned acts.

Broken Beat is the newest addition to the plethora of sub-genres
that fall under the broader electronic music genre.  While
definitely related to and influenced by the other styles, Broken
Beat also known as Future Jazz or Nu Jazz, differentiates itself
from the pack by fusing jazz rhythmic patterns, and
improvisational composition with organic and electronic
elements.

The origins of the genre can be traced back to the late 90's in
West London where a handful of talented and respected electronic
musicians began to break the mold and produce music that defied
categorization.  Led by luminaries such as Jazzanova, Giles
Peterson, and the Bugz in the Attic collective, the genre began
to take root and garner international attention.

For April's Penetrate, we are pleased to bring Jazzanova
Compost, Archive, Reinforced, and Residual recording artist
Domu. An innovator of the Broken Beat sound and one of the
busiest artists in the industry, Domu will be coming all the way
from London, UK for his first ever North American appearance.
Opening DJ sets will be provided by Residual Recordings
label-heads and Penetrate resident DJ's Titonton Duvant and
Thomas James.

TIMESLOTS

Domu London Uk  12am to 2:30 am
Titonton Duvante 11pm to 12 am
Thomas James 10 pm  to 11pm

This event brought to you by Experimedia Communications, Molotov Records, 
Headroom Digital, Shift Club Night, and Touch Supper Club.

"This is one of the most significant rosters I've ever observed to grace 
the area and it's even more taunting for me that I couldn't be there to 
support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're truly privileged to be 
offered such rare appearances courtesy of the event producers who're 
credited. Those responsible obviously share an increasingly rare 
enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast with most 'parties'. 
They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an intimate setting, thus 
providing an amazing opportunity to witness these talents whose impact is 
undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all involved and encourage 
anyone who can't stand 'the same' music being played at 'parties' to treat 
yourself to an evening of what is sure to be a great experience and 
hopefully an eye-opening impression on a few of you!"

Mon Apr 28                         PROCEED                         Columbus

HEADROOM DIGITAL and RESIDUAL present PROCEED, a monthly series
of events featuring live performances of original and cutting
edge electronic music from international, national, and local
performers.  PROCEED occurs the last Monday of each month at
5:01 Jazz Bar.

Date:
April 28th, 2003 at 5:01 Jazz Bar in Columbus

Proceed is a monthly series of events dedicated to showcasing
the original side of electronic music through live performances
by internationally, nationally, and locally renowned acts.

This month's Proceed will explore the sounds of Experimental
electronic music and IDM, creating an exciting and compelling
evening of aural stimulation.  The event will feature the
artistic talents of Detroit-based Ghostly International and
Eastern Developments recording artist Dabrye, as well as Ghostly
International, Bip-Hop, and Hefty recording artist Twine
accompanied by a live video manipulation performance by Phase4.
Opening DJ sets and musical interludes will be provided by
Residual Recordings label head Thomas James, and Headroom
Digital's Douglas Black.


Artist Biographies:

Dabrye:

Dabrye is just one alias of Ghostly International recording
artist Tadd Mullinix, who shifts through various guises with a
refreshing competency and sophistication.  His Dabrye LPs,
"One/Three" and "Instrmntl," the latter for Scott Herren aka
Prefuse 73's Eastern Developments label, brought him critical
acclaim in the hip-hop underground from notable figures such as
Jay Dee and Jurassic Five.  His techno-ready James Cotton
moniker won him fans like Techno and House luminaries Matthew
Herbert and Laurent Garnier.  The classical structure and
melodies of his debut full-length under his birth-name "Winking
Makes a Face" and the 2002 follow-up "Panes" turned the
chin-stroking IDM connoisseurs on their heads.  With a new
Dabrye LP for Ghostly International due out in late 2003, Tadd
Mullinix looks ready to bring Dabrye into the elite of
forward-thinking and groundbreaking new artists.

Twine / Phase4:

Greg Malcolm and Ric Hudgins, who perform as Twine and Phase4
respectively, bring an approach and aesthetic to their
performances that is typically only observed in the worlds
finest art galleries and museums.  Their live performance
experience was described in Urban Mag, a Dutch electronic music
and culture magazine, "With its intricate colors, abstract
shapes and organic texture, the video seems like a visual
equivalent of Twine's music...the work of Phase4 is based on
similar ideas that are being used in so much music:
de(con)struction, abstraction, decontextualisation..."  This is
to say that the audio and video each undergo a kind of digital
destruction, and re-constitution within a carefully constructed
human feedback loop.

Twine and Phase4 have had the opportunity to take these ever
evolving ideas into the larger arts and media, and academic
worlds through various projects.  Their work is featured in the
SONIC PROCESS exhibit in Barcelona Spain, curated by the
Pompidou (Contemporary Arts Center, Paris France) which looks at
modern life and contemporary arts through the filter of
electronic music/culture.  Their collaborative work is also
featured on PIRATETV.NET, an on-line showcase for talented VJ's,
DJ's and electronic musicians created and hosted by the UK's
world renowned electronic music and media duo, COLDCUT.

SATURDAY MAY 3rd, 2003

DJ SMASH
(BLUE NOTE, NYC)
www.bluenote.com
www.djsmash.net

DJ Smash's current involvement as conceptual director and producer with 
Blue Note Records only hints the range of his experience and talent for 
bringing together diverse elements within the realm of Dance music.

Starting his journey into sound in the late 70's as Disco swept NYC (and 
the world), Smash found his calling via the turntables and the inventionof 
the 12" single. Being too young to gain entry to nightclubs, his first 
gigs were blockparties and basement jams (featuring the occasional dj 
battle) in his hometown of Brooklyn. With the emergence of rap, his skills 
were sharpened while working with local neighborhood MCs and the 
relationships soon evolved to producing tracks and "battle tapes" for 
various MC contests and demos. 

As the rap game became more commercial, competitive and violent, Smash 
sought out other musical forms to express his diverse taste and 
creativity. House music was the next major musical influence and inspired 
him to become more prolific in the studio working with singers and 
musicians in replacement of rappers. After shopping numerous demos the 
payoff was being signed to the trend setting dance label Sleeping Bag in 
the late eighties. He produced several songs for other artists on the 
label but longed to release his own records. As that was 
about to become a reality, Sleeping Bag went under which spurred him to 
take his untried sounds elsewhere. 

As a result, his first releases as an artist were for the ground breaking, 
New York City underground dance label Nu Groove Records. "Cutting my first 
3 records with no censorship or musical discrimination from a label was 
such a blessing to me" says Smash. "Karen and Frank (Mendez) were risk 
takers and way ahead of there time for a New York label. Being able to 
learn the business as I went along yet being given the respect and freedom 
to find my own way musically really planted the bug in my head to start my 
own label like I saw Kenny Dope and Bobby Konders do with them". 

After Nu Groove dissolved in 1991, Smash teamed up with an investor and 
started Eightball Records producing the first 5 releases under different 
monikers like Jazz Not Jazz and Jazzy Grooves while signing and 
co-producing Napoleon Solo's cult funk hit "Come On Girl" as well as 
producer Fred Jorio's Lectroluv Project. 

After creative conflicts with their Eightball partner, Smash and new 
partner Asia Love founded a new imprint specifically focused on the 
growing global phenomenon of the 'Acid'Jazz and Trip Hop movement. They 
called it New Breed Records and it featured a diverse roster of talent 
from around the globe. For most of the artists, namely Lisa Shaw, The 
Prunes, Hustlers of Culture, Peanut Butter Wolf, Tommy Gurerro and 
Khromozome Project, it was their first record deal and a testing ground 
for new and unusual ideas. The label had a six year run (1991-1997) as one 
of the premiere Acid Jazz and break beat imprints out of New York with a 
focus on signing and nurturing talent rather than licensing in tracks, 
which most other labels chasing the trend chose to do. 

With over 30 remixes and 75 original released productions to his credit, 
working with the likes of Roy Ayers, Herbie Hancock, Towa Tei, Guru and 
Donald Byrd among others, Smash has traversed the creative boundaries of 
the music business with clever and innovative appropriations of differing 
styles, at times blurring the lines of what's considered house, hip hop, 
jazz, reggae, dub, and funk. His legendary NYC residencies have included 
Save The Robots, Nell's, and Giant Step as well as numerous guest stints 
at various bars,lounges, clubs and festivals internationally.

on the ground,unless you want to help us pick them up in the morning),and 
also if you`re handed a flier that you don`t want,either tell the person

trash,there will be plenty of bags around,same goes for water bottles and 
anything else you might throw on the ground.This is a beautiful venue 
surrounded by a state park,so try to keep everything nice looking. This 
venue is in the middle of no where and all permits have or will be taken 
care of,so this event is sure to go off without any problems.

Sat Oct 18                    STREET OUTLAWZ 2                   Pittsburgh

Steel City Racing (SCR)
Presents: Street OutLawz 2 (SO2)

The time is 1200 hours the date is 10/18/03 and the location is Pittsburgh 
PA.  The company that brought you a revolutionary event is now back to 
bring you the much-anticipated sequel to a phenomenon that began 1 year 
ago.  We gave much thought about how we could improve our event from last 
year and we decided to eliminate the racing aspect and the sometimes 
brutal outdoors so we moved the legacy that started it all indoors into a 
beautiful large facility located in the heart of the steel city. We wanted 
to assure everyones safety this year and keep our show as a one of kind 
superstar import car event.  Even though we wont be racing vehicles this 
year there will be tons of fun, and many different creative things going 
on.  I will have to keep you in suspense about most of the activities that 
we have planned until the time is right but I will give you brief taste of 
what is in store for SO2.  Picture an event like you have never witnessed 
before lights, visuals, sound, lasers, dancers, djs, mcs, models, free 
stuff, contests, entertainers, many different automobile divisions, tons 
of cash prizes, a outdoor portion and indoor portion, and much more TBA!  
If you thought that Street Outlawz was as good as gets you wont believe 
your eyes when SO2 hits the city. So prepare yourself for an event that 
will once again go down into the history of the Steel City!


ELECTRONIC MUSIC:
	(These are only a few of the major headliners that will be 
featured at the event please stay posted to our website 
www.steelcityracing.com for more detailed information)

DRUM N BASS:

FREAKY FLOW w/ MC Flipside-(Drum N Bass)
(Toronto, Canada/ Moonshine Music/C.D. Release)

Since last year the Freaky Flow duo has been very busy touring all around 
the globe and back but it still seems as if everyone cant get enough of 
his outstanding scratching skills and track selections.  If its not 
magazines then its live TV the Freaky Flow combination has truly been 
just about everywhere making everlasting impressions and setting new 
standards. If you had the opportunity to see this dynamic duo at last 
years event you could understand why we would choose to bring them back 
for a second helping.  But if you didnt have the opportunity to catch 
these two amazingly talented individuals then allow yourself the time to 
step outside of the box and give them another friendly welcome back to the 
steel city!  Because on October 18th 2003 we promise another incredible 
sounding set that will set new standards to our electronic music scene.  
We are also very proud to announce that SO2 will mark their next CD 
release tour and we are sure that these two unstoppable celebrities will 
bring back free goodies and some more bangin ass music!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} The KLF- The White Room

Consider this my "Me too" post.

I have an MP3 copy of "Space" if anyone is interested in downloading it...it's amazing.

If you don't know what Space is, it was a project by James Cauty of KLF and Dr. Alex
Patterson...they had some sort of falling out, Patterson formed Orb, and Cauty cut his parts out of
the recording and released it as Space.

Sickly hard to find now....

"This is one of the most significant rosters I've ever
observed to 
grace the area and it's even more taunting for me that
I couldn't be 
there 
to support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're
truly privileged 
to be offered such rare appearances courtesy of the
event producers 
who're credited. Those responsible obviously share an
increasingly rare 
enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast
with most 'parties'. 
They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an
intimate setting, 
thus 
providing an amazing opportunity to witness these

I couldn't be
there
to support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're
truly privileged
to be offered such rare appearances courtesy of the
event producers
who're credited. Those responsible obviously share an
increasingly rare
enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast
with most 'parties'.
They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an
intimate setting,
thus
providing an amazing opportunity to witness these
talents whose impact
is undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all
involved and
encourage anyone who can't stand 'the same' music
being played at

many moons ago there were some guys at a rave who had in a VW beetle a 
rave on wheels.  this was in the pittsburgh area c. 1994

they had 2 turntables and a mixer, a 909, 303, and a ms-20, and a nice 
sound system.  this was all hooked up to the car via an inverter.  the 
car had to be on to supply power, but it was pretty funny to see this.  
they had the back seats removed and a deck built.  

i have no idea what happened to these guys.

I'll second that.  Too bad it's only a half hour long.  Just realized 
when looking at the track listing that legowelt did the last couple 
songs.  And I really like those tracks too :)

Luke Eargoggle from Stilleben will be coming shortly.
Rutherford may come along as well.  Rutherford from
Stilleben will have a track on the next Molotov
Records release, Molotov12-02, and Luke Eargoggle will
be releaseing an EP on Molotov in the near future as
well.  

Dexter may be in the works for some shows over here as
well.  We shall see.

Oh yeah...Tom, and Curt...I know both of you are
expecting to see me in Pittsburgh...well at this point
I am debating on wether I will hit the Pittsburgh show
or not since I have to work until 9pm so if I dont
show up dont hold it against me.  Curt I know you
wanted a Molotov12-01...doesnt Cutups still have some?
 if not check with the Bunker Crew...they may have
some with them.  But then again...I may make it
tomorrow night...feeling kind of impulse this week.

granted, joey used to put out some of the best techno way back (energy
flash, the start it up, etc) but he went all disco on that ass.  his
production for the last few years has been super-disco/rave-siren bullshit.
last time i saw him i didn't hear one single 'techno' record....or one
beatmach.

don't forget the classice Places LP on tresor. Next to close Grind 
(Novamute) it's some of his finest work to date. 

Sadly the majority of his releases since then have been nothing 
but shit! (and he's always been an average techno dj, solid but 
nothing special) And I guess you contribute that to the general 
decline in quality techno 12" that's available. 95% of the records 
released nowadays suck, most are chep rip-offs of tracks that were 
made years ago. Perhaps 95% is a bit of an exxageration, but 
there's a lot of horrible records being released week after week. 
That being said i would see go see him, since who knows when 
you 'll get another oppurtunity to see him in this area. I just 
wouldn't expect a life changing experiance, as Mr. Beltram's is 
just living off his former glory days at this point.

OUCH!

i agree a majority of the tech-records that come out these days 
are lack luster...(or maybe its just that your taste has improved 
greatly over the past few years)

I personally havent listened to any of his stuff, but it cant be  
any worse than my favorite techno karoke record by the boogism 
guys....hmm...i gotta find that record....

;-)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Joey Beltram

gameform was some dope shit.  i wore out 2 copies of it.

for the longest time i tried to see him at various parties, but he was 
always a no-show.

so i just gave up trying.  finally i did get to see him at aquatic, that 
party at a waterpark down south of columbus.

he played some of his old stuff and some good techno.

Anyone else going out to Dedication tonight?  I"ll be
there later for my first time out since I moved to
Columbus. Can't wait to hear what kind of smash-up
tunes Reid Speed is bringing in.  It'll be nice to see
Dave Ralph again as well. Maybe I'll cross paths with
some of you.

                       Peace, Sharpie

I really do not understand why goose always steals my password for my email accounts, and then changes it to whatever he wants, so I can't read my email.I get alot of personal mail, with work, friends, etc.. what the heck?  Are you that bored?  OH, that's right, you admitted before that you have some disk that actually SCANS for the persons' password. l o s e r  Ne ways, if he sends any email from janet_in_ohio@yahoo.com that is not me.  So, please check the ip address or whatever, I have a feeling he literally gets off from sending messages from my name to make me look bad or whatever else.  and i think it is because he must have no friends, which causes the man to be very bored. All he does anyways is work at a desk, so i'd be bored too.Wait, i do work at a desk, doing insurance claims and health claims , etc. for praxair and i don't get that bored... because im working. your a fag

Well, if that IS Goose writing under your email, I give him props for
being able to speak the "roofus language." =P He has mastered it quite

yeah.  I JUST love having all of these posers.  Jamie, obviously you are a poser too, since you understand my original post (nrr: stealing passwords) since I wrote it, and if I am roofus, which I believe I am, and I speak "roofus language" then you must have it down better than me. Anyone else have my language mastered? if you reply... then you probably are one of my followers! :)***yeah, im being posed***

 Beat Matrix WRUW 91.1 FM 10:30-12:30

The Beat Matrix Crew would first like to thank DJ Osmotic for driving
all the way in from PA to drop a great live set in our studio. His set
list is available on the website.

We've got another special line up for the show on April 28!  

First we're going to kick off the night with a few unreleased tracks by
Bedrock's Thomas Penton followed by an interview with him at 10:40.

>From 11p-12a, Jason Soditch will take care of the live, in-studio mix.

Then we'll close off the night with all of the brand new music we've
received at the station!

Monday night's going to be bangin'! Tune in at 10:30p, 91.1 FM or stream
it from wruw.org.

Subject: {pb-cle} PROCEED : feat: DABRYE : TWINE/PHASE4 : SERVO


Headroom Digital & Down Deep Present:

PROCEED
Monday, April 28th

feat.
Dabrye
(Ghostly International : Eastern Developments)
Live Experimental Hip Hop PA

Dabrye is just one alias of Ghostly International recording artist
Tadd Mullinix, who shifts through various guises with a refreshing
competency and sophistication. His Dabrye LPs, "One/Three"
and "Instrmntl," the latter for Scott Herren aka Prefuse 73's Eastern
Developments label, brought him critical acclaim in the hip-hop
underground from notable figures such as Jay Dee and Jurassic Five.
His techno-ready James Cotton moniker won him fans like Techno and
House luminaries Matthew Herbert and Laurent Garnier. The classical
structure and melodies of his debut full-length under his birth-
name "Winking Makes a Face" and the 2002 follow-up "Panes" turned the
chin-stroking IDM connoisseurs on their heads. With a new Dabrye LP
for Ghostly International due out in late 2003, Tadd Mullinix looks
ready to bring Dabrye into the elite of forward-thinking and
groundbreaking new artists.


Twine / Phase4
(Ghostly International : Bip Hop : Hefty Recs : Headroom Digital)
Live PA / Live Visual Manipulations
Greg Malcolm and Ric Hudgins, who perform as Twine and Phase4
respectively, bring an approach and aesthetic to their performances
that is typically only observed in the worlds finest art galleries
and museums. Their live performance experience was described in Urban
Mag, a Dutch electronic music and culture magazine, "With its
intricate colors, abstract shapes and organic texture, the video
seems like a visual equivalent of Twine's music.the work of Phase4 is
based on similar ideas that are being used in so much music: de(con)
struction, abstraction, decontextualisation..." This is to say that
the audio and video each undergo a kind of digital destruction, and
re-constitution within a carefully constructed human feedback loop.

Twine and Phase4 have had the opportunity to take these ever evolving
ideas into the larger arts and media, and academic worlds through
various projects. Their work is featured in the SONIC PROCESS exhibit
in Barcelona Spain, curated by the Pompidou (Contemporary Arts
Center, Paris France) which looks at modern life and contemporary
arts through the filter of electronic music/culture. Their
collaborative work is also featured on PIRATETV.NET, an on-line
showcase for talented VJ's, DJ's and electronic musicians created and
hosted by the UK's world renown electronic music and media duo,
COLDCUT (Ninja Tune).

Soup aka Servo
(Beta Bodega Coalition : Etihad : FonoForum/PhonoPhorum)
Live Experimental Downtempo PA
Formed in 1998, Servo/Soup is the vehicle for Stewart Brown and
Garred Martin's musical journey. Experimental and accessible at once,
Servo's music combines chunky beats with warm playful melodies. The
duo is currently signed on several labels including Miami-based Beta
Bodega Coalition, Etihad Records, and Phonophorum, along with label-
mates such as Takeshi Muto (Romulo from Phoenecia), Jake Mandell,
Push Button Objects, and Prefuse 73. Servo has performed live in
cities such as Detroit, Miami and New York with some of the biggest
acts on the experimental/electro circuit including; Richard Devine,
Oval, Ectomorph and Phoenecia. These experiences have sharpened their
skills, and allowed for a mature and unique sound to develop. Servo's
music evolves with each release, and they are currently in the studio
finishing up their upcoming full length release on Beta Bodega
Coalition under the alias Soup.

Indeed, I wasn't aware of his complete style now adays, but I did know 
he was putting out some funky stuff (not too much to my liking). 
However, who knows what he might drop in his set if he's in town... and 
anyways, WHAT ELSE is there to do that night?

amazing... they mentined mashups in a CNN article! I've got damn near a dozen CDs full of 'em and am thinking of throwing a house party with those as the entire playlist! Problem with 'em is once you start digging arond & finding more, you just wanna get 'em all. But I'm pretty much under the impression that I have most of the worthies (though I'm almost certainly not 'looking in the right places') & am anxious to just start making them myself... I have some hilarious combos lined up! ;) Does anyone know if the term 'glitchmash' has been used yet?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} madonna (mashups)

I got a demo from a guy in Australia a while ago.  He
does some electro but then also included tons of
cut-ups and mash-ups.  Some great ones on there.
Like I Love You (Justin Timberlake Remix)
Keep It Real Bitch (J.Lo Remix)
Flash In Here (Nelly Vs Moroder)
Fuckin Girlfriend (Nsync DnB Mix)
Bumrush My Love (Madonna vs P.E.)
Lose Yourself (eminem dancehall mix)
Work It Out (Beyonce Dnb Mix)
Ghetto Pron Queen (J.Lo vs Ladytron)
Love Will Freak Us (Joy Division vs Missy Elliot)
Dont Need U Tonite (INXS vs Madison Ave)
Getting Away With It One More Time (Electonic vs
Britney Spears)
Tainted Music (Madonna vs Soft Cell)
Groove's A Bitch (Deelite vs Basement Jaxx vs Missy E)
This is Missy Country (Missy E vs Country Moog
Classics)

Some crazy stuff.  I am releaseing two of his tracks
in the near future but his more electro stuff
including my favorite his electro version of nirvana's
smells like teen spirit.

Here is his site he always has new downloads of mash
ups and shit.

yes!!!!!! I have as much stuff of his as I could find, damn Jeremy, you're always on the next shit! In fact, a lot of what I was considering 'glitchmash' is stuff that he put together. Totally fresh... that link should have everyone's CD burners at work ;) so... Dsico on Molotov? That's freakin' impressive. PROPS!

Yeah for sure.  Dsico rocks it.  Check out the audio
section at http://molotov.experimedia.net .  You will
see he has a track coming up on Molotov12-02.  Great
guy.  Cant wait to find time and money to release more
dsico tracks.

Thanks once again for the kind words anthony.  Keep it
fresh!

Subject: {pb-cle} shift/abasso last saturday

okay, heres the pix from the creme/bunker show at touch last saturday.

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/shift-creme

it was a really good show,  alot of good music.  also got a copy of 
molotov's first release.  some good stuff on there.  snag a copy if you can.

checked out abasso after for a little bit.  not many people there, but 
people there seemed into it.  i don't know if its a little more crowded 
earlier in the night, because we didn't get there probably until 3:30-4?

anyhow it was good to see people out.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} shift/abasso last saturday

last sat was rather slow all night...i think there was
simply too much going on last weekend (fetish
ball/legowelt), and we weren't doing anything big. 
Also, some folks bailed early for various reasons.  At
least a good number of those that stuck it out for
afterhours were up and dancing...that was enough to
make it fun for me, so if any of y'all are on here,
thanks.  

Peace,
Jamie

Trout @ Abbasso?  Hey--you've got to introduce yourself ! lol. Yeah, I've seen Abbasso busier too, but there was so much going on...and much of the regular crew was out of town too, at various different places, not too mention a lot of peeps are planning to come down there next week.  So Touch was good too?  I hate it when things fall at the same time, would have loved to visit Touch last week, and Nitty Gritty and Penton are on the same night this week--hate it when that happens! Shame though, I thought Jamie played pretty well, liked the track selection, and the crowd was fun.  Penton is this weekend, I'll be surprised greatly if the place isn't much more packed.

I'm feeling the same about this weekend...

Thomas Penton, DJ Smash, Edgar V, and DJ Who all on the same night.  So much
I want to do, I'll be at the DJ Who show and _maybe_ make it to Abbasso
late.

May is turning out to be a busy month!

Speaking of which, what time is he scheduled to go on?

Does Abasso have a website?

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Good question, I was wondering when Penton would be playing myself.  e-mail Amy: amy@headrushmusic.com she should be able to answer that.  I'll try and find out and post it in the meantime. If you ever do want to check Abbasso lineups/times though here's some sites of interest... HEADRUSH MUSIChttp://www.headrushmusic.com Headrush Music are the ones who booked Penton for this Sat, and do the True Friday events at Abbasso (plug:This week, Deviant, Darbe and Jamie Tyler), They also have all the info on the rest of the Summer Series at Abbasso (Max Graham, John Howard)   NITTY GRITTY FORUMhttp://nittygritty.smartformation.com/default.asp Both Jamie and Amy post most of the lineupsand times for Fridays and Saturdays as well details every week on Nitty Gritty's forums  I think info about Dan Petrov's Warm Art (beginning May 10) at Abbasso is on there now too.  (And of course all the Nitty Gritty events at Touch are here also) And lastlyBOTTOMS UP/ABBASSO CLEVELANDhttp://www.bottomsupofcleveland.com/7.html Not really as up to date, but it has address, contact info, pics. of the bar, etc.. Coming out Sat. I'm guessing?

>more packed.

Speaking of which, what time is he scheduled to go on?

Does Abasso have a website?

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: {pb-cle} Mango canceled this saturday

Mango is canceled this saturday.

Tim will be off touring the woods of Costa Rica and I will be playing before 
Thomas Penton (Bedrock, Gatecrasher, Euphoria) at the Abasso Lounge in 
Cleveland.

We hope to see you all next week when we welcome Groovebox to the decks. 
Judging by last weeks 1200 people jont through dejAVu lounge, looks like 
things will be very strong all summer long.

If you live in Pittsburgh, are over 21, and haven't made it to a Mango yet, 
WAKE UP. It's free and HUGE!!!

Peace,
Osmotic
Twin/Innerchild

i think it must be a user error, since it runs fantastically on
even my sister's craptastic computer. mine's on 24 hours a day 7
days a week with just about no problems ever. and this computer is
3 years old with no upgrades done to it except the addition of a
gigantic HD to put all my slsk DLed mp3s on.

what user error is there when i type in the chat things and it takes 
15-20 seconds to respond, and drags my system down, and the slsk task 
becomes unresponsive?

smacks to me of some sort of memory management problems....

i mean there are other ways to find data files ....

I used to have problems with soulseek seek bogging down my system
(especially when I had my browser open) but the latest versions have
