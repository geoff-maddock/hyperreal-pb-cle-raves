                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way

Saturday, March 24th, 2007
D.P.S. (DETROIT PARANORMAL SOCIETY) also known as..... Local 313 presents....

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters

1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM

*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} HARDFLOOR @ DEMF

HARDFUCKINGFLOOR AT DEMF. HOLYFUXORZ.  whoa.  i am so psyched.  
hardfloor is the most amazing thing i've ever in my life seen at a rave.

Detroit's Electronic Music Festival 2007 to showcase rare performances 
by legendary Detroit artists Moodymann, Model 500, and Jeff Mills

Movement 07, Detroit's Electronic Music Festival will feature 
performances by legendary Detroit artists Moodymann live featuring Pitch 
Black City; Model 500 featuring the godfather of Detroit Techno Juan 
Atkins; and Jeff Mills, the longtime hard hitting "wizard" of Detroit 
Techno. The festival will take place Memorial Day weekend May 26-28 at 
its home in Downtown Detroit's Hart Plaza.

Moodymann (Kenny Dixon Jr.) is a Detroit techno/house artist known for 
his innovative use of reworked riffs, samples and grooves taken from the 
City's historically influential jazz, soul, funk and disco scene. Rarely 
appearing live, his headlining performance at the festival is the first 
show in support of his upcoming studio album and will include a full 
stage show with a band.

Juan Atkins, who is widely regarded as the godfather of Techno, began in 
the 1980s recording what stands as perhaps the most influential body of 
work within the genre. Model 500 will headline the main stage on Sunday 
at the festival, highlighting the continuing influence of his music on a 
global scale.

Jeff Mills is a planetary superstar of techno, an unwearied hero of 
mega-events and an ace of the three-deck mix; his musical touch has been 
a force on this city's dance scene for over 20 years. Jeff returns to 
Detroit to headline the festival with a main stage closing performance 
on Monday night.

Other 2007 special performances include German producers Booka Shade, 
who have earned a reputation as one of the world's most exciting live 
electronic music acts. Their performance at the 2007 festival will mark 
Booka Shade's first appearance in Detroit. Also performing live will be 
Octave One, featuring Detroit natives, brothers Lenny and Lawrence 
Burden, who have released groundbreaking underground dance anthems on 
their Detroit-based record label, 430 West Records.

In addition to Moodymann featuring Pitch Black City, Model 500, Jeff 
Mills, Booka Shade, and Octave One, the 2007 festival will feature the

Yeah I am really considering going this year as well.
I haven't heard of hardfloor *ducks* but it seems that's the guy everyone is
"raving" about,
so who knows?  You might see my goofy self dancing in detroit this year.

They've been releasing tunes on Beatport recently as well. Great stuff, as 
there isn't too much good acid house floating around...

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Here's another lineup sneak peak...

Goaheads:
Malachi
Meghan
Ari D
Uzi

Shaman Films:
EgNogRa!

Sample:
http://youtube.com/watch?v=dCPQubIE2Hk

What a perfect weekend to have one of Mexico's own out as our
guest for Cinco de Mayo weekend! We are very happy to have
another representative from Shaman Films on our lineup!

Guillermo will be doing visuals for us all night and
will also perform a special VJ/DJ set with 3D animation
film and special effects.

Stay tuned for a full lineup announcement later this month...............

Egnogra

Guillermo crashed on planet Earth 24 years ago without a clue of his
existence, meantime he tries to remember and understands what it means
to be human. He spends his time listening to crazy musik, prolonged
hours infront of a computer and thinking a lot about life and its
meaning.. He enjoys the absurd and the bizarre as a healing therapy
for the soul and mind.
Born in Mexico City Egnogra relocated to San Francisco to study
animation and film and since then shaman films started as a television
show for independent filmakers, later he realized the target audience
werent alien audience so he shifted towards all his artistic tube in
direction of the Trance Scene.

Djing since 14 years old always a fan of crazy musik acompanied by the
misterious and the occult..
Egnogra founded shaman films records in 2005 with one vision to create
an outlet for both Visual Artists and Electronic Muscians,
and here is the result of the experiment..

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Mar 24                        FUSION 2                          Detroit

Saturday, March 24th, 2007
D.P.S. (DETROIT PARANORMAL SOCIETY) also known as..... Local 313 presents....

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Egnogra

Guillermo crashed on planet Earth 24 years ago without a clue of his
existence, meantime he tries to remember and understands what it means
to be human. He spends his time listening to crazy musik, prolonged
hours infront of a computer and thinking a lot about life and its
meaning.. He enjoys the absurd and the bizarre as a healing therapy
for the soul and mind.
Born in Mexico City Egnogra relocated to San Francisco to study
animation and film and since then shaman films started as a television
show for independent filmakers, later he realized the target audience
werent alien audience so he shifted towards all his artistic tube in
direction of the Trance Scene.

Djing since 14 years old always a fan of crazy musik acompanied by the
misterious and the occult..
Egnogra founded shaman films records in 2005 with one vision to create
an outlet for both Visual Artists and Electronic Muscians,
and here is the result of the experiment..

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

Subject: {pb-cle} Calling on all artists for upcoming P.U.N.C. art shows!!

In 1999 through 2002 my partner, Smartie and I put
together some really successful, non-traditional art
shows at Rosebud in the Strip and the Attic in
Oakland. We infused electronic music and live
percussive acts with art, fashion and dancing
exhibitions to create P.U.N.C.! Now, for Pittsburgh
Urban Nightlife Culture I'm teaming up with some new
people and bringing these shows back on a monthly
basis. I hope that if you are an artist you will be
interested in showing off and selling your work. Or if
you know anyone that would be interested please pass
this information along. We already have a lot of
artists interested and we're only picking about 10 to
15 per show. So if you can't show your work at the
first event then rest assured that you will definitely
get your chance.
   
  Again, this is just a calling for artists. We
will post more information about the actual event in
the near future. What i can say now is that P.U.N.C.
is 21+, no cover, goes from 7pm to 2am and happens on
the first Friday of every month. If you're interested
please contact me, Dave Purcell at daveclevr@yahoo.com
or Jesse Riesmeyer at jesse@organicgraphite.com
   
  Thank you for your time,
  Dave Purcell

Subject: {pb-cle} question about Ohio health code

Maybe someone can point me in the right direction.

We have signage in our store stating that per Ohio health code, we cannot
do any returns on pierced earrings. I'm not sure this is accurate and I
need to find out for sure. A couple Google searches haven't gotten me
anywhere and I'm thinking that may be because no such law exists ... but I
could be completely wrong. Any help is greatly appreciated - I've got to
edit our return policy and get the correct wording to our sign vendor
ASAP.

Thanks!

Amanda

At the very least, I've seen that message a few of those little  
kiosks in the malls where they do piercings.  So it's not just your  
place that "says" it, but that still doesn't mean it's correct  
though.  Can't remember if others said exactly "per Ohio health  
code..." or just "due to health code..." or just simply "No returns  
on earrings"

It's probably too late, and I'm sure this is of no help, but...

Why does it matter? I mean, if it's company policy to not accept the
returns, shouldn't that be good enough?

I'm actually helping rewrite company policy. =)

Our president (my boss) asked me to research the 'no returns on pierced
earrings' statement since we'd actually be more than happy to accept such
returns if allowed. I'm redrafting the official store return policy and
don't want to quote inaccurate information since we're having a large sign
made for above the registers and of course, we'd prefer to pay for this
sign only once.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

Saturday, March 24th, 2007
D.P.S. (DETROIT PARANORMAL SOCIETY) also known as..... Local 313 presents....

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Egnogra

Guillermo crashed on planet Earth 24 years ago without a clue of his
existence, meantime he tries to remember and understands what it means
to be human. He spends his time listening to crazy musik, prolonged
hours infront of a computer and thinking a lot about life and its
meaning.. He enjoys the absurd and the bizarre as a healing therapy
for the soul and mind.
Born in Mexico City Egnogra relocated to San Francisco to study
animation and film and since then shaman films started as a television
show for independent filmakers, later he realized the target audience
werent alien audience so he shifted towards all his artistic tube in
direction of the Trance Scene.

Djing since 14 years old always a fan of crazy musik acompanied by the
misterious and the occult..
Egnogra founded shaman films records in 2005 with one vision to create
an outlet for both Visual Artists and Electronic Muscians,
and here is the result of the experiment..

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

Haven't added any pictures, but I've moved everything over to the new
version of gallery with is pretty sweet now that they finally added the
bulk updating of watermarks.  Everything from the old gallery has been
moved over, so if you signed up on the old one, you're still on it.
Still need to fix some of the descriptions since g2 handles those a
little differently.  An interesting new feature is the keyword dynamic
album.  Any keyword I've remembered to set you can see in one big album.
  If you remember how I add '??' to pictures I don't know everyone in
that keyword album is 313 pictures :) And the search actually works well
now.

Since the server sucks I couldn't generate all the thumbnails while
importing the pictures or else the cpu would overheat--yeah, I have a
server but waiting for new version of debian to come out. *sigh*.  So if
you go to a page it make take a little while to load the page while it
generates all the thumbnails.

The old links /should/ redirect you to the correct location, but you
should still update any links you have pointing to the old links.

Subject: {pb-cle} Aerogel at Raves

Does anybody know of any creative uses for Aerogel at parties?  Don't 
know what Aerogel is?  It's the lowest density form of matter known to 
man and comes from Silica.  It's a direct application of 
nanotechnology.  It was confused as the forth state of matter because it 
looks like frozen smoke.  I'll try to procure some of this fascinating 
material for "experimental uses."  The only practical application I can 
thing of is bricks to stack turntables on or as jewelry.

You could use it to encase rolling ravers to protect them if they fell. 
But if they were encased in it, I suppose they'd fall over for sure.

definitely a really cool molecular arrangement with how strong it is, but
about the only thing i could come up with as a practical use was to put it
on spacecraft... namely, the Galactica.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Saturday, March 24th, 2007
D.P.S. (DETROIT PARANORMAL SOCIETY) also known as..... Local 313 presents....

F   U   S   I   O   N      II
                                                
featuring..........


MAIN AREA:

from UR-live & The Aquanauts
SKURGE - live - dj

Interstellar Fugitives / UR - Underground Resistance, Detroit, Techno

When the 7. single .Cruise Ship Killer. [UR 2004] was released by the 
Aquanauts, the world came to understand the terror of DJ Skurge. His 
follow-up, .Slide, Skate,. [UR 2005] is an intense dance floor hit. 
Working from Detroit and Japan, Skurge teamed up with Mike Banks and 
Gerald Mitchell.as Interstellar Fugitives.to produce a double CD of 
explosive tracks, .Destruction of Order. [UR 2006]. Skurge is not 
content to simply produce and often ventures out of the studio to 
destroy DJ complacency. He sends a message to chin-strokers everywhere: 
.If you.re not dancing, you.re already dead!.


drexciyan
STINGRAY
Rephlex | Planet E | Mo Wax | Retroactive, Detroit, ELECTRO

After releasing a number of solo singles, Sherard Ingram (aka Urban 
Tribe aka Drexciyan Dj Stingray) worked with Carl Craig, Anthony Shakir 
and Kenny Dixon, Jr. as Urban Tribe releasing their first full length 
album on Mo Wax. Following up with the recently released new album 
"Authorized Clinical Trials" on Aphex Twin's Rephlex label. Stingray is 
probably best known for one of the all time great Detroit Techno 
classics, ''Covert Action'', which appeared on the legendary Retroactive 
imprint in 1990, to be reissued by Planet E in 2002. Prior to that he 
worked on one of Kirk DeGiorgio's New Electronica albums, all the way 
back to the beginning with Juan Atkins & ''NASA'' in 1987.

Need we drop any more names or offer further description? This man has, 
time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of electronic 
dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to avoid 
distraction and dilution of his sound. This new album on Rephlex opens 
the flood gates to a ton of new material aimed at both club DJs and 
bedroom scientists alike! The album ?Authorized Clinical Trials,? is 
already being praised by those who have been lucky enough to hear it 
(e.g. receiving hot promo pressure during the recent Squarepusher UK 
tour and keen interest on Underground Resistance's new forum). And a 
follow up album has already been produced.

This man has, time and again, proved himself as one of the godfathers of 
electronic dance music, while managing to maintain a sub-aqua profile to 
avoid distraction and dilution of his sound. All hail a substantial new 
member of the Rephlex family, who shows that electro doesn't have to be 
new school or retrodden and that techno doesn't have to be predictable 
and emotionless.


SCAN 7 - live
Cratesavers / Tresor / UR, Detroit, Scan 7's signiture sound of dark 
hard detroit techno........

The follow up to their Accailmed set @ Autumn Ritual recently in 
Detroit, Scan 7 is back!  Originally born in the late 80's, SCAN 7's 
first release, "Voices Beyond", came out on the Submerge compilation, 
"Escape Into The Void". Next, they unleashed projects such as, 
"Introducing SCAN 7" and the "Undetectable EP" both on Underground 
Resistance, and an exclusive "S.I.D." EP entitled, "Invisible Thoughts". 
In the late 90's TrackMasta Lou's made contact with Europe's most 
respected European label, Tresor Records - Berlin, through Blake Baxter 
and through a liaison with Dimitri Hegemann (owner of Tresor & credited 
for introducing Detroit Techno To Europe) TrackMasta Lou released many 
rare recordings on the Tresor compilations. Later TrackMasta Lou put out 
two collectable albums with Tresor, "The Dark Territory" and the 
"Resurfaced" album. Both were laced with a deep dark dose of classic 
Detroit Style Techno, and embedded with the imprints of the SCAN 7 
trademark drums. Other labels that SCAN 7 has released material on: 
Underground Resistance, Soma, Fcom, End to End, Elypsia, and Pow Wow 
Records


SUBURBAN KNIGHT
UR- Underground Resistance / Dark Print / Warp, Detroit, Techno

A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s,
James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the
moodier side of the Motor City with classics like "The Art of Stalking"
and "The Groove." And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come
out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster "Big Fun" by Inner City, he later
recorded with subterranean mainstays Underground Resistance. It was
through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, Derrick May, that
Pennington began recording. May had set up his own Transmat Records in
1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third
release for the label, "The Groove." He had also been working with Kevin
Saunderson, and co-wrote "Big Fun" with Saunderson and Art Forrest. 
After vocals were added by Paris Grey and the record was released, it
became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for
many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for
Transmat, it was the dark classic "The Art of Stalking."

With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington 
became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With 
UR, he released the singles "Nocturbulous Behavior" and "Dark Energy." 
He also featured on the Submerge label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, 
and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length 
Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Direction' was 
released to critical aclaim including both classics and new, unreleased 
productions.

Egnogra

Guillermo crashed on planet Earth 24 years ago without a clue of his
existence, meantime he tries to remember and understands what it means
to be human. He spends his time listening to crazy musik, prolonged
hours infront of a computer and thinking a lot about life and its
meaning.. He enjoys the absurd and the bizarre as a healing therapy
for the soul and mind.
Born in Mexico City Egnogra relocated to San Francisco to study
animation and film and since then shaman films started as a television
show for independent filmakers, later he realized the target audience
werent alien audience so he shifted towards all his artistic tube in
direction of the Trance Scene.

Djing since 14 years old always a fan of crazy musik acompanied by the
misterious and the occult..
Egnogra founded shaman films records in 2005 with one vision to create
an outlet for both Visual Artists and Electronic Muscians,
and here is the result of the experiment..

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

I think they use this stuff as fake "ice" on photoshoots.  (do you 
REALLY think those perfectly formed ice crystals on the side of the 
budlight bottle are ice?)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Aerogel at Raves

Depending on when you can get there, they have aerogel at the great  
lakes science center. I know there is a permanent exhibit for it, but  
you can actually play with it depending on who's in the exhibit booth  
for the day.

I do recall seeing something about how you can make it from near  
household materials, including gin.

Given its properties, it's remarkably tough, but it's not as tough as  
you'd think. It fragments easily. Take a look at the display at the  
museum, they have it behind glass because it's that fragile, and the  
pieces are chunks all over the place.

About the most inventive use for it I'd think is hanging some at a  
few points at a rave, then afterwards sending it out for chemical  
analysis to see what's in the air there. That's what they use it for  
on space missions.

I found a powerpoint about how it's made, if anyone wants a copy, I  
converted it to PDF, just hit me up.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Aerogel at Raves

The only things that come to mind for me for uses at a party are
decorative. Maybe shooting lasers through it? Could look interesting/cool.
Also, embedding LED's in little cubes of it could produce interesting
results...

I'm gonna crawl back into my hole now.

Shooting lasers through that stuff could look

At least during my childhood, when I first learned about Aerogel, it was 
commonly called frozen smoke.  I know people (professionals alike) to 
have confused it as being fourth state of matter.  That's the beauty of 
material science as nature always challenges our interpretation.  
Especially now with nanotechnology coming into play and altering our 
entire physical world.

It would be hilarious to send some aerogel after a nights raving to a 
chemical analysis laboratory.  I just wonder what kind of chemicals they 
would find and how it would all be classified.

Anyhow, I wanted to bring some into a party to see if it creates any 
ambiance.  I'm interested in it fluorescence properties as I think it 
would make great decoration.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Egnogra

Guillermo crashed on planet Earth 24 years ago without a clue of his
existence, meantime he tries to remember and understands what it means
to be human. He spends his time listening to crazy musik, prolonged
hours infront of a computer and thinking a lot about life and its
meaning.. He enjoys the absurd and the bizarre as a healing therapy
for the soul and mind.
Born in Mexico City Egnogra relocated to San Francisco to study
animation and film and since then shaman films started as a television
show for independent filmakers, later he realized the target audience
werent alien audience so he shifted towards all his artistic tube in
direction of the Trance Scene.

Djing since 14 years old always a fan of crazy musik acompanied by the
misterious and the occult..
Egnogra founded shaman films records in 2005 with one vision to create
an outlet for both Visual Artists and Electronic Muscians,
and here is the result of the experiment..

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)
