not much of a review,  more complaining.  ....
first we drove out of our way to pick up a girl who changed her mind and
forgot to call us and tell us.  there went 60 minutes.  then the crappy
direx, there went another 60 minutes, by the time we got there it was 3
am.  bad things:
1-no water bottles (any bottles actually was what i was being told)
2-gestappo style security
3-no bags
4-no cameras!??
i felt like it was starlake, polaris or _the_agora_ ....
3am and they still wanted 20$.  i went and took a nap, to hell with 20$
that late and all the other bullshit.  justin woke me up after 5 and said
they werent at the door and a few ppl i knew were inside. so i made the
trek in and it was the middle of sleepy-c's set.  good tracks.  then i
talked to ed and tom and met some fellow from indiana.  then the sound was
shut off and the lights went on.  everyone got upset coz alot of djs were
cut and I GUESS SOME PPL ACTUALLY NOTICED!!!  titonton went on and i got
to see the beginning of his set and had to leave a little after 7am coz i
have werk at noon (where i'm at now)....
more rants....  i guess the elementals were put on the flyer as
co-promoters where they actually had little to do with the event at all.
after this i'll prolly never go to another illuminator party again,  i
still have a bad taste in my mouth over the voodoo fiasco a few years ago.
of course that is all my opinion, your mileage may vary.
trouty.

wow, never before have i been treated to such an incredible night of hard,
pounding, dark, meancing, growling electronic music. first of all, this
party was shady as hell, but despite all of the shit the party went off
bigtime because the insane music and vibe pulled it all together. when i
called the infoline it said the party was to go from 11:30-9am. i got to
the good ole Valleydale Ballroom around 11:45 and was asked to go back in
my car and wait for '15 minutes' while they got everything set up. looked
like some sorta japaneese wedding reception was going on or something.
did i mention it was raining profusely at this time? so everyone was stuck
in their cars, just chilling. i hung out with some friends in their car
until about 12:30 or so when we got in line and finally made it in about
12:45, an hour after i got there. no one was allowed downstairs on the
floor (we went down anyways) until about 1:30. when everyone was let in it
looked like Doughboy was on, only spinning a few tracks ranging in
variety. no one really payed any attention, which is a shame because i
know he can break out the hard tracky stuff which would have been perfect
for this party. after the masses were allowed to go down to the floor,
KevyKev got up and spun a dark jungle and breaks set for about 30 minutes.
not too bad, but you really couldn't pay much attention since the sound
was still being set up so it was cutting out and distorting alot. so, now
it's 2am, and the party FINALLY starts. the Kooky Scientist delivered an
incredible pa, starting out with very minimal detroitish tracks and moving
on to very complex and pounding material, including several tracks off of
his new record. even though this was the first real act of the night the
floor was already going crazy, tons of cheers and dancing, the vibe was
there after everyone was fucked with so bad. after Kooky Scientist's pa,
Fernando got up and delivered an incredible dj set. very layered and
textured german hard hard trance and techno that would just build up and
explode out of nowhere. by this point the dancefloor was actually starting
to get slippery from the level of heat and humidity in the room, but the
vibe was incredible, lots of whistles, cheering and everyone was dancing
as hard as they could. i wish Fernando could have spun longer (seemed like
about 45 minutes?) but the best was still to come. next up, the Spicelab
pa. holy shit, i don't think there is a word in the dictionary that can
sum up the insane level of intensity, energy, and darkness of this set.
you really couldnt leave the dancefloor for a second, it was that good.
the buildups were beyond belief, i thought i was going to collapse from
the sheer force of the music. i was so surprised to see everyone getting
into such a hard, dark set...some of the tracks were very high bpm, close
to oldschool hardcore, while others would slow down to a growl, lulling
you into thinking it was going to be a chillout track, right before it
exploded into pure madness and totally kicked your ass. yeah, i loved it.
Roland Casper then spun an absolutely genius set of more dark, hard shit.
less friendly than Fernando, but i can see why this guy gets the big
bucks, it was bliss. the dancefloor was still pretty packed and people
were really pulling out every last bit of energy they had for this set.
my legs were starting to cramp up, but i didn't care, you don't hear
tracks like this every day. after an insane hour of Roland Casper,
Sleepy-C went on and started with some milder, more downtempo
trance/techno. i took this time to get a much needed rest and chilled
listening to this very smoothe set. but about halfway through he started
throwing down the hard hard stuff and got me back out to the floor, wow,
tight mixing and tracks that just kicked your ass. ok so this is where the
bullshit starts. it's like 6:45 and the party ends. i go to fill up my
water bottle in the bathroom, and when i come out the lights are on. hmm,
the info line said until 9am. and that was with the party starting at
11:30, the music didnt start until 1 or so. Sleepy-C spins a couple more
tracks and the party ends. most people just stand there, hoping something
was going to happen. no one really seems to know what was up, but the
crowd was not happy, there were 5 more djs to go, what the fuck? so, the
lights go off, were told that we are getting another hour of music. thats
cool, but still not what we payed for. but i soon forgot about all the
bullshit and shady promoters, Titonton got up and represented what was
probably the most intense jungle set i have ever heard in both 
technical/skill and track selection. a dark ass techstep set was what i
needed, and Titonton totally fucking ripped it up. pure science. bigups to
T. CRAZY scratching and mixing, combined with the darkest tracks out
there. the columbus jungle massive gathered in front of the speaker stacks
and we and pulled what seemed like inhuman amounts of enegry out of our
wornout selves. Titonton only got to spin for about 35 minutes, then
Spinboy and Atman did a totally kickass tagteam, the tracks just as dark
and hard as the rest of the night, i danced until it was all over. so it
was now 8am, i was slightly miffed about the entire situation, but i still
feel i totally got my $20 worth. more would have been great, but i'm not
sure there was any way possible i could have danced another second. as
everyone left walked outside they were greeted with one last surprise:
half of the parkinglot was under water. i guess it would have been too
much of a bother to announce sometime during the night that the parkinglot
was flooding? or maybe they didn't want to cause a rush to the door since
there was no readmittance. whatever, my car was fine but several people's
had water up inside of them, etc. but anyways, in closing, when i left my
ears were ringing, my head hurt and i was in pain to walk. i wish they
could all be that good.

ps: bigups to j-Sun. we represented the whistle massive :)

Hey friends, neighbors and robots...did anybody go to "Gettin Lucky"
and/or "Feelin Lucky"?  I couldn't make it out. :( Any reviews?  Ditto
with the Projekthaus REVO thing.  What was their setup like?  Wish i
could'v seen'm.  Anyone know of any pittsburgh raves in the near future?
It seems the calander is oddly blank all the way till July - or am I
missing something?

Also - an update on my "Technology" zine:  Things keep getting pushed back
because of printing problems...I think I may just move to doing
photocopies.  No promises, but #2 should be at Steel City this Tues, and
I'll have some copies of #1, which is outdated, but has some jungle
reviews.  Anybody that contacted be about writing - feel free to send me
stuff, or I can tell you what I'd like more of if you'r stuck for a topic.

anyway...see you folks at steel city...:)

l8s,

it's me elias! i'm finally back! =] =] =] yay yay yay! it took awhile 
because the library here is not open late & i usually work in the
afternoons & nite, so i finally managed to wake up at 7:15 am so i
could get the bus but i still had to walk about 2 miles to get here,
but that will be easier when the flooding is over & i can skate
over. there were 487 messages here! & i just skimmed thru them really
quick. =O somehow i didn't get unsubscribed after all but thanks
anyway jeff gage for trying to help me. anyway working at cedar point
is fun fun fun but hard & we all work usually 9 hours a day at least
with only 1 day off so it's like 50 hours or more a week but that's ok
i'm making lots of $. i'm a "prep cook". it's boring. & i am suffering
from a severe lack of parties & techno music! i dance everywhere like
to cheesy pop music at work + "dance mix usa" stuff at the roller
skating party & beyond-commercial hip-hop at the local juke-joint/
scary-dive-of-a-bar + even the 2-unlimited/quasi-techno/disco at the 
laser show (they have 1 every nite here, + incidentally it's the
biggest laser show i've ever seen. i counted 10 lasers, there were so
many trackspotters i couldn't count them, there's a screen like 5
stories high, and fog (on the announcement there is a disclaimer
saying the fog is "safe" & will not harm the spectators. hahaha!). too
bad this amazing laser show is used to make silly cartoons most of the
time + 1/2 the music is rock, and some is country--which is at once
hilarious and sad--to satiate the trailer trash who constitute the
majority of cedar point's "guests", & that hardly anyone there
appreciates what they're seeing + it's made by probably $1 million
worth of equipment. the rest of the "guests" are generally "fashion
ravers" (in phat pants & marilyn manson or some death metal band
t-shirts) or wanna-be gangsters right out of suburbia. anyway somebody
please (shameless begging!!!) take me to a party! where i am is just
off of the turnpike & on the way to detroit, cleveland, chicago, erie,
nyc, etc. from anywhere! i am so close to detroit & have never been
there & want to go to practicallly anything in detroit! i have plenty
of $ for once so you will get all the gas money you need plus candy,
anything else you want just ask, etc. and big rainbow lollypops, etc.
by the way i can get DISCOUNTED TICKETS =] (even if you don't give me
a ride) for anyone for $23 & if you give me about a weeks notice i can
get 1 day off & go with you since i get in for free. there are 57
rides & 12 roller coasters here, more of each than anywhere else in
the whole world, plus a waterslide park. but right now i don't
recommend it, there's rainstorms & it's flooding & freezing cold + not
all the rides are always open (we don't even have heat in our rooms 
=[ ) here is my phone #: 

***************************419.627.2121 x5143****************************

give this # to everyone you know (even if i dont know them i don't
care), call me, & tell them to call me. i will have an answering
machine after friday.

by the way i can't find anybody who will do the tongue-web piercing
they say it will bleed too much, i don't care how much it bleeds
though,  so i got the regular piercing, it's so hard to eat now! :]
it ended up a little crooked but i'm getting it fixed this
week... anyway i need to be a work by 2 so i've got to go now bye
everybody!

I was at the Projekthaus REVO thingy.  Much fun...my first time
seeing/hearing REVO.  Much much better and more than I expected.  Not
very techno-y, but if you're into serious electronic music at all, a
must-see.  

They went on around 11pm.  Their first three tracks were very good, with
the third even incorporating a bit of jungle-ish beats.  They played 5
or 6 songs, then stopped.  Then most people left, and they ended up
playing around some more, and improvised an extended piece for probably
another 30-40 minutes...which was excellent.

They even let me play around for a bit later on.  :-)

Their kit:  

-4 people

-4 Mac Laptops running their custum "Back-to-Basics" sample-playing
software (this is available as a free download from their website, and
if you got a Mac, highly recommended)

-a Commodore 64 running some weird old sequencing software called
something like "Instant Music", which, oddly enough, was controlled via
a joystick.

-a Casio CZ-1000, CZ-101, Arp Axxe, and a Yamaha SY2 (or something).

-a Yamaha RX-11 drum machine.

-a Boss SYB-3 (I think)--this is the new weird bass-synth pedal that
sounds amazingly like a TB-303.

-a DOD distortion pedal & a DOD delay pedal.

-a tascam 8-channel mixer and a radio shack line mixer.


I think that's it.

What up from a newbie....  I made it to Gettin Lucky, not a bad setup, it was
in a underground (really) place called the Ardmore Roller Palace, a good
locale for a party cause the beats stay nicely enclosed and loud under the
city.. no complaints from the townspeople.  The lineup was different than
noted on the flyer, Feelin Lucky had a turnout of about 5, so the a lot of
the DJ's got bumped. Gettin Lucky started out hard ass!  Tim Zelch (Akron I
think) crushed everyone with some mad hard trance right off the bat.  I set
up my fuzzy yellow blanket by the entrance to the rink.  BTW, fuzzy yellow
blanket, thats me...everywhere....so, the hardcores came out and got loose
right away, some cool lookin ballet boys started doing perouettes and stuff,
the usual tall girl with the airport flight landing sticks waved away in her
own bouncy little way, a Korean kidd demonstrated a hunched knees-up boxxxy
style, and me and my friend Kimmie-with-the-K-car, loosed up to the funky
pulses of Zelches trance.  Not much longer later we were both sweating
profusely, hints of baby powder, fresh vaporub, and steam began to fill my
lungs with the sweet eXtacy of the scene.   The party had started..  Zelch
spun long enough to set the mood of the party, and what was to come next
would find me shirtless in a world where music is the soul reflector, his
name was Feelgood...trance hinting drum and bass...amazing set..  I LOVE horn
samples and Feelgood tossed in the horns with a splash of lemon.  The rest of
the party was kind of anti-climactic.  Next was Snuggles with the jungle tip,
steam machines hissed out, and the disco balls lit the room with crazy beams
from groove heaven... Pretty cool for a while but most all the dancers I
talked to were ready for some lighter shit like house or even breakbeat of
some kind, and the dance floor never really filled out, there were like 200
people there and only about 50 or so dancing at the height.  Also I think
that the line up could have promoted more dancing, the trance was not so easy
to get loose to, and the jungle..should have been in its own room..so we
waited out the jungle as a party, the chill out area was basically the tables
and video arcade area, which was nice, but not as nice as being able to sit
amongst backpacks and people giving wonderful backrubs, kind of felt like a
coffee shop chill area.  I met the next DJ's girl Jennifer who was very nice
and she assured me that her man JP Soul (Buffalo), was on next and would
break out the housey housey house.  He did, and without saying too much...the
party was over 20 minutes later..sounded like trance if anything.  All in all
I had a good time, I found a new groove in my dance, and found that my shin
splints arent as bad as I thought.  As for the crowd, not enough dancers, too
many people watching.  18 bucks for four DJ's....I dont know.......

wellll... me and my 3 friends went to feelin' lucky, and we were the only
people that went. you think i'm kidding, dont you? well -- we were the
ONLY people that went (besides the promoters and djs). no one was
dancing. it was 150% bullshit. kinda funny, tho, that we were the only
ones who went. they shut it down really early - they just gave us tickets to the night one. it seems like they lost a shitload of money, cause
someone said only 300 people came to gettin' lucky... i wonder if
they'll still throw parties...

Why thanks! Sounds to me like it's turkey time, Jive Turkey time that is. 
 When things get wack and overpriced we kick it for free. Look for more
North Shore renegades in the near future... Mad props to Michael of the
Projekt Haus for maintaing the free haus party thing. Also look for a few
more ultracheap parties from Empire Systems (the folks that brought you
Technique). On a side note I have noticed a noticible lack of involvement
among the younger/newer folks in the scene. It seems they want everything
handed to them on a plate. While this is nothing unique to Pittsburgh it
hurts us more because there is no existing club infrastructure to support
such laziness. Once all us old schoolers are gone what will be left? This
summer will be a good indicator of that.

And I am sorry but 18$ for a party in a space that has been used several
times before, is relatively cheap to rent (At least 3 parties before Get
Lucky were held in that space, thus proving the whole "100% Virgin Space"
on the flyer a lie, or this promoter is so new to the scene and/or the
area he or she didn't know).	

		 Some Startling Facts and A Comparison


Year:	1992				1997

Party:	PowerRave'92			Gettin' Lucky

Space:  Ardmore Roller Palace		Ardmore Roller Palace

DJ's: 	Richie Hawtin, Adam X		Snuggles, J.P Soul, Tim Zelch
	Heather Heart,Rob Sherwood	Eric D(who didn't spin) & 7-up
	Deadly Buda, dieselBoy 
	Kris Kersey

Live Acts: Cybsonik & F.U.S.E		*no live acts*

Sound:	A wall of TurboSound and Klipch	A couple Klipch stacks
	on each side of the stage.	on the floor.

Price: $8 in advance $10 at the door.	$18 only at the door.

Attendance: 900-1000			200-300


------------------------------------------------------

Draw your own conclusions but I know that my philosphy is "Just say No to
overpriced wack parties." It's precisely partties like Gettin' Lucky which
will kill off any remnants of a scene here as people choose not to go out
(is it any wonder only 300 people max went to this? Come on we had 3000
people at TunnelVision, is this what it has been reduced to?)
I know that this Shamrock is just bad luck and I will be staying clear of
them.

By the way, I'll see you all there tommrownight. If Last Steel City was
any indication then this too should be a good one. Seems Like Steel City
is about the only thing running anymore that draws an enthusiastic crowd.

Kennywood is hardly a friendly environment for a bunch of ravers. 

Sides, who's gonna go to a rave after a day out in the hot sun. Everybody 
will be worn out.

i'll go to kennywood, but i'll have no part in the rave.

Wow...many thanks and shouts go out to the steel-city massive...if you
don't know, now you know - the steel city runz 'tingz in the jungle...

All the dj's sets were top notch...sine was breaking off some jazzy and
tech sounding stuff when i first came in, quite nice to chill to before
the rough stuff.  I wish the tables were more near ground level, coz when
i heard that "Nu-Yorkan Soul" track, I was totally into a rewind of that,
but my voice was way down at mouse level.  Next up was Tik-Tak, who I
never heard before - he came out and rocked the house with loads of great
jump-up and steppin' tunes, and, yes! scratching!  Definitly my style of
jungle dj!  Plus I was pleased that he wasn't afraid to play good tunes
that aren't exactly brand new - I like to hear dubs and all, but there's
still pleanty to good tunes in the vault that aren't played out.  Much
rrrrespect to the whistle & horn krews, and everyone on the dancefloor.
Near the middle of tik-taks set I was feeling a lil' sick :( and i sat
down, but looking back at the dancefloor was an awesome site - packed,
mixed and groovin'! :)  The last dj was Noel from SanFran, and he took it
to another level.  His style was all over the place (including some
really slammin hardstep), but his set worked really well...especially
since kids keep hearing thes 2 hour sets of *all* techstep, or *all*
jump-up...he really came from a different angle than most djs I'v heard in
pgh.  Does anyone know what the name/artist was on the track he spun near
the end, maybe the second to last or third to last song?  It was slightly
dark, almost acidy, and all the sounds in it - bass breaks, etc were
really tightly together, almost creating a single sound out of the parts?
Really innovative, or at least different in my opinion.

Can't wait for the next one....which will feature Slant, Sine, 187 live
pa, and krea8 (I think).

l8s,

No doubt Geoff!!  SCJ is the most fun thing we've had to do in this city
for a long time.  I love seeing all of you guys there, and watching all
the smiling faces jump around on the dance floor.  Big shouts out to
grrl13, 187, Doc Cut-up, Braniac, Sine, Saint, Adair, MSKW, Ummm,
D/Strange, Alaska, Spaed, Obeah, Karova, Dust, Kevin, Tik Tak, Noel, and
any other DJ who showed up in the crowd that I missed.  I think all of the
DJs who know the tunes are a large part of the SteelCity experience. How
many times did you turn around and see a newbie's eyes light up when the
horns and whistles climaxed with a drumroll, or teased the breakdowns? 
It's the call and response of Jungle that makes it such an involving
experience. I know Joe was having a blast by the huge smile on his face 
everytime he blew that horn :-)

The only thing missing was an MC.  Where were you Sphinx!!?  We needed
so many rewinds, and no matter how we called for them, there just wasn't
someone up in the booth keeping an eye out for the lighters. It's too 
hard being a DJ up there, trying to hear what's going on and pay 
attention to the crowds for their "wheel and pull."  I wanted a rewind of 
"It's Jazzy", but by the time I got up to the booth from the dancefloor, 
the moment had passed.  Anyways, that's a minor gripe ... all in all 
things were great and I'm already anxiously awaiting the next show.  

And of course, massive shout outs to John, Natalie, Josh, and Andy for 
bringing it all together for us once again! Big Respect to the aleph and 
UDG crews.

No.  The entire thing smelled like burning phenolic resins to me, so I 
passed.

REVO rocked all known sheep.  Their rig consisted of a couple of 
Powerbooks, a Commodore 64 (yeah!), some synthesisers (not a musician, so 
I have no idea what they were), and a couple of qwerty keyboards on 
shoulder straps ala _Revenge of the Nerds_, for which they earned my 
undying respect.  I had to cd ~ partway through their set as a couple 
cabal-mates had to be returned home early, but Anarchangel and I came 
right back.

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

shit.  monday i spent all day at columbus car audio waiting for them whilst
they worked on my car.  there was this truck from alpine there called
"cyber oddysey" giving free demos.  it is basically this truck filled with
$300,000 worth of alpine shit and a big video screen with like 8 seats that
also each have an individual monitor.

it's fucking intense.  24 subs, 6,000 watts of alpine amps, bass engines
under the seats.  you watch like this 10 minute presentation and basically
are blown away.  you can feel your insides rumble.  it even features about
30 seconds worth of jungle.  i'd highly reccommend checking it out if it
comes to your town.

on yet another NRR note, what do y'all think of the new wu?  i went to a
midnite sale at world record and there were easily 200+ ppl there.  they
were doing midnite sales at a couple other record stores here too.  i don't
think it's as good as the first one, the production is quite different.
and a lot of it just seems to be filler...i dunno.  but hey you can't beat
20 bones for 4 LP's i suppose...

take two of these and thank me in the morning,

Hi everyone..
 
This is Dennis from Skylab2000. Every few months I like to send some mail
to tell everyone what we've been up to.. It's been about 4 months so here's
some news..

Tons of you know us, or have seen us perform, but for those of you who
don't, a quick intro:

We've got releases on Fatal Data, ZYX (Germany), Brainiak UK, JDJ
Productions (UK), Silent, Big Fish, Egg and a few other labels, plus tracks
on the Taylor, John Kelley, and Keoki mix CDs.

Most of these releases are "acid breaks" type stuff.

We're based in Los Angeles and have played a ton of local events over the
last couple of years, including some really large parties such as Circa and
Playscool. We also play out of town a lot. We've recently performed at
events in Santa Cruz, Las Vegas, Madison, Seattle, Phoenix, Winter Music in
Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Chicago, Vancouver and more!

Last weekend we played in New York and we have Pittburgh, Madison, Florida
and more coming up soon..

So far as news goes:

Next months issue of Fix Magazine has us on the cover, with an article
inside. We've also recently had articles on us in Stiction and Step-Up, so
hopefully some of you caught them..

We've just released a new double 12" and CD single on JDJ (UK), with two of
the tracks also on the new Journey's by DJ "TripTonight" triple mix CD. We
also have a track called "Every Cloud has a Brother" on the new Egg records
compilation.

For much more info on us, or to see some pictures or video, check out our
web site at http://skylab2000.com

Lastly, please write me back if you are a promotor looking for a live act
(no DATs!) to rock yer party.

peace

osmosis stunk.  mostly the location, and TOO MUCH HOUSE (we all know how i
feel about that stuff)  ...  
i didn't really even want to go, but my friends buggered me until i caved
in and piled into their car ... i didn't even know who was spinning and
noone knew where it was so i could tell where this was going ...  we did
manage to find it alright and what not.
this osmosis was at the daily double, not a promising start. well they
demanded id's and we had a kid w/o one, zach had to say they went to skool
together and blah blah blah.  then there was no reentry, even at 4am!!!
what the hell is this all about, last 2 parties i went to had this.  
on a lighter note, i like the expansion to the double on the side.  i
dunno if its new, or they just kept it shut the times i was there way back
when?  i liked the lights, i dunno if they were house lights or who's but
they filled the room really well.
so for the most part after the lights got boring, i ended up sleeping in a
corner and waking up every now and then to see if it got any better.  it
didn't so i ended up once again in the car sleeping....  _sigh_

well, it would be nice if that was written on the flyers, but everyone is

Well as an ex-promoter (ex-promoter because of bullshit little fucks like
the one above, who don't appreciat anything that is given to them) of at
least 30 small and large events, I pose the question of how do you allow
re-entry???!!!
How can you do it???
How do you do it, when every kid and there brother is trying to sneak in
for free, and will do anything they can to accomplish this??

Hand stamps you say..... nope, as soon as the first person leaves to to go
to there car,  and then come back in, you can be asured that a troop of
raver artists is at the ready call to copy, copy, copy the addmission
stamp!! (BAMM- you just lost 250 people to fake stamps!!)

Ahhh wrist bands!! nope,don't work!!  I have witnessed (at my shows!!) the
following, as soon as the first peoson who has the real wristband leaves
the show to go to his/her car, a kid in the parking lot starts selling rist
bands for $2 to all the people they could find. (how do they do this you
ask??, if you carry enough of the basic colored wrist bands around with you
, about 80% of the time, you will find a match) (ZOTT- just lost 350 people
to fake wrist bands!!)

hmmmm, no stamps , no wristbands, the kids can fake both of these, so what
can a promoter do to insure him/herself that they won't loose a pile of $
to the sneaky scumbags that will always try to sneak in.......

ahhhh I got it, NO RE-ENTRY!!
Sorry to say it's the only thing that works, and it's the only thing that
keeps scumbag, ignorant looser , shouldn't be part of the scene,need to
grow up, ravers out of your show!! (unless they pay, then they can
disreguard the scumbag,looser part!) And I ain't all about $$$, but it is
really nice to break even !! ( and it really sucks to see 800 people at you
show havin a ball,when you only needed 600 to break even, but you still
loose $5000.00!!!!????!!!!) (No re-entry would have fixed that problem and
then it would have been amazing to see 800 havin a graet time!!)

One last thing, not to sound old, or anything, but all the ravers that are
complaining about everything lately, (my water bottle bla bla bla, the
space bla bla bla, only 40,000 watts of sound bla bla bla, too far of a
drive bla bla bla)
need to quit being the young spoiled brats your sounding like. If the
parties are that much of a downer, STAY THE FUCK HOME!!
I fucked up my knees , so I can't dance as much as I used to, but back then
(1989) and even now if the dj's show up, the sound is above average, and
there's at least a flashlight on a string, I danced (and these day's "try
to") my ass off, and I almost always  have a really good time.
 Back in the day, it was understood that the parties we were going to, were
outlaw events, we were lucky to have running water at most spaces. And we
were happy to just be in one space listing to electronic music and vibing
together.
I understand that the scene has evolved, and so have the parties, but I
really don't think anyone had to change the origional idea!!
GO TO SHOW,HEAR DANCE MUSIC, DANCE, CREATE A VIBE, MEET PEOPLE, AND HAVE A
GRAT FUCKIN TIME!!
Nowhere in that idea are the words "complain" or "gripe alot" or "be a
snotty little brat", nor are the words," take the scene, the artists and
the promoters for granit."!!!
I'm not going to get into this right now, because I feel it will fall on
deaf ears, but take the time to see how much work goes into an event, and
then see if it's really worth complaining about some trivial little
bullshit.

Sorry to be a downer, but that's the way it is!
droppin the reality of a scene that I love,but at the moment is making me sick!
Sleepy c

free fliers to anyone who replies to this message by tuesday afternoon. 
make sure to include your full name, snail address, and a vague idea how
many you want.  the event is in columbus this friday the 13th (my good
luck day!) so perhaps this last-ditch effort is pointless, but it is a
very special event unlike anything i've ever tried to do (even more
extreme than last year's ACTIVE.NOT.PASSIVE), so i'd like to spread the
word to my fellow mw/pb-cle/net family.  also, the flyer is an art object
in and of itself so even if you can't come, i'll still send you some just
so you can see it for yourself. 

as an event, ACTIVE.NOT.PASSIVE is an attempt to bring the best aspects of
electronic music and electronic media together in one place, combining a
serious artistic attitude with a party atmosphere.  it is an event
intended to stand as an alternative to all the events which have
emphsasized DANCE MUSIC as opposed to just MUSIC, and it is an opportunity
for you to go to a party with the express purpose of having fun by just
listening to music and interacting with friends; and who knows, maybe even
learning something.

make no mistake: this is a DOWNTEMPO event, so don't expect to hear too
much house, techno, or jungle to dance your feet off.  but DO expect to
hear some music you can dance to.  DO expect to hear some music that will
challenge your idea of what music can be.  DO expect to hear music that
will relax you and take your mind (and body?) to another place, or even
into yourself.  DO expect to meet new people and get to know those people
you only get to see at the big, loud events every week.  

you'll get some names you might recognize (DAC CROWELL, TIM CRAWFORD,
DOORMOUSE), you'll get some you've probably never heard of (CENTRAL
INHABITANTS, MARY WATTS, BAMBULE), but this event has been specifically
sculpted to fully utilize 2 sound systems simultaneously, and every one of
these performers is completely devoted to this event and what it stands
for.  how often can that be said about a more traditional rave, ask
yourself that?

best of all, the location is one that many of you already know: the
southside settlement house, where (C):CARBON, SNOW*DRIFT, and THE RETURN
OF SUPERFLY took place.  they are graciously allowing us to do this
special event in their amazing, multi-room/multi-purpose space.  

if you're still not convinced this event is worth paying attention to,
please note the price: only $5 before 12 midnight (or $8 after). two full
sound systems, over 10 performers, 9 hours of music.  well worth it.

[and if that isn't enough, there's a wonderful $10 event the following day
presented by collective intelligence: FUNKENBUMPEN (call 614.470.3839).
two parties for $15 bucks total.  there you have it...]

I have a different perspective about the "complaining" on this list.  I
used to get really ticked off too about it -- but I think that text based
communication can be misleading.  I think that most of the "whining" is
really just constructive criticism.  I appreciate the comments -- both
negative and positive -- because that's how we improve things in a
democracy.

Promoters need feedback (I'm a professional promoter of trade shows and
conferences, so I feel justified to say this).  And the only way to get
feedback is to ask your attendees and guests what they thought.  It's
human nature to air the negative before the positive, but that is how we
make it better the next time.

I want to support those who have the courage to criticize parties and
music on this list -- not because I enjoy negative vibes but because it's
how things will continue to spiral upwards toward better, more enjoyable 
and better run events.  

To support Sleepy C, though, it's just as important to hear what the
promoters and dj's think about parties too.  

The thing that might be considered differently is how we express these
vital opinions.  It seems to me that putting each other down is not the
way to do this.  There is plenty of room for criticism without making the
comments appear as a personal attack.

they've lost money and not once have i seen him give a diatribe about it 
on here.

this first paragraph is a quote from some other fellow, in case you 
didn't read the first line in my post: 
> >> No reentry is a real biter, ravers need fresh air.... Reentry should be
> >> mandatory, especially if theres no chill out room... From now on Im taking

well, this is true, look at the flyer for wicked kingdom.  i dont have it 
handy, but it runs in my mind that the labels occupy 1.5x6 inches.

> Well as an ex-promoter (ex-promoter because of bullshit little fucks like

> How can you do it???
[snip. about counterfeit stamps and wristbands]
ummmm, this was in a bar that has always allowed for re-entry.  MAYBE 
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE?  also, SYNAPSE APOLOGIZED TO MY RIDE THAT 
IT WASN'T HIS IDEA TO HAVE NO RE-ENTRY. IT WAS THE BAR'S DECISION TO DO THAT.
 
[snip. steve calling me a whiner and a biter and a loser, etc.]
bite me, i'll whine all day long if i want.  i still go to parties that i 
have fun at, I'M TRYING TO POINT OUT WHATS WRONG WITH CERTAIN EVENTS AND 
WHERE FUTURE ONES CAN BE IMPROVED.  IF YOU DONT WANT TO IMPROVE FUTURE 
EVENTS, GUESS WHAT, I'LL KEEP WHINING ABOUT IT. 

> Sorry to be a downer, but that's the way it is!
sorry to THINK for myself, SPEAK for myself, and have an OPINION that you
dont like, but that's the way it is!

the theory of relativity applied to modern day raves:

the promotor's thoughts: i've got 600 kids here...i need 200 more to
,break even...where's dj sooper hype...i can't believe those stoopid
kids tagged up the bathroom like that, idiots!...and i know the owner's
gonna charge me a buttload for it...gawd i hope some stoopid kid doesn't
flip out again & we hafta call an ambulance & shut everything down...
now these kids wanna get back in...shit the last time i let re-entry
some bastard had 600 pink wristbands in his car...i betcha he just wants
to go back to his car so he can get more drugs to sell cuz he ran out...
and u know if i don't let him go, he'll go & talk shit about me to all
his buddys at the party & when he gets home he'll talk even more shit
about me to about 600 kids on mw-raves and 200 kids on pb-cle-raves!!!

the raver thoughts: i'm fucking burning up here...it's a hundred degrees
on the dance floor...they confiscated my water bottle...man i just wanna
go to my car, lose this shirt in my car...since the last time i put my
shirt down some bastard ganked it...go to the nearest gas station w/ the
air conditioning cranked up...and buy myself some pop so i don't hafta
shell out $3.50 for a smart drink & take a piss so i don't hafta wait in
line for an hour!!

a point: the longer u stay in the scene, the more & more jaded your thoughts
become...i can definitely attest to that, this is mostly due to people
screwin u over...gankin your shit...not keepin their promises...jealousy,
greed, inexperience, etc. etc...until one day u decide why am i putting up
w/ this shit...why am i wasting all my time, energy, and money for all this
hatred and no appreciation...when i can be doing something else, something
more constructive and better for me...maybe it's time to retire...so you
quit for awhile but every now & then u go through some withdraw symptoms,
but eventually you discover...there's a whole world out there...and there's
so much other things out there, but you were just too close minded or your
thoughts were too jaded at the time to notice them...

a possible simple solution for the problem at hand: keep the kid's id card
or have 'em sign their name on a sheet, when they come back you can check
signatures & cross'em out

In a message dated 97-06-09 14:02:17 EDT, you write:

Whoa, I write a couple sentences and what the hell, the whole world is about
to end.  Holy crap, all was saying is that ravers need fresh air, and fresh
water, both of which should be free, aren't these things the two basic
ingredients of life, and the earth.  The party I was referring to was Lucky
which was underground in a roller rink, thus, one small door and no windows,
even in the bathroom....  Sleepy, chill man, I bet you would have
thought........

>> No reentry is a real biter, ravers need fresh air.... Reentry should be
>> mandatory, especially if theres no chill out room... From now on Im taking
>> that into consideration before making a decision whether or not to head
out
>> to a party..
> 

If you were there.  Personally I have no real complaints about the scene...
 Whatevers cool with me....
I like to have freedom to move around, especially under influences, its just
cooler to be able to go for a chill out walk or to talk with someone you meet
in a friendly quiet environment for a minute, sure beats yelling, and I
really like to hear a beautiful soothing voice every now and again, I think
thats why DJs mix in samples of them...  You know....
Its nothing to do with the scene, in fact, if you ever met me you'd know I
add not subtract... so anyway, its not scene ripping, just thoughts..   See
you all at Family Affair III, plenty of room there..

Love,
Jason

i wouldn't say this is exactly the way to open, presuming your goal is to
persuade people to agree with you.  *shrug*

>How do you do it, when every kid and there brother is trying to sneak in
>for free, and will do anything they can to accomplish this??

while i understand you may be jaded by the number of sneaks at the first
420...i hardly think this is a safe assumption.  plenty of people realize
sneaking is WACK and won't do it.  why not try having someone stand at the
door with little tickets or something, and if you need to leave, get a
ticket?  then you can use it to get back in.  they did this at the first
UFO in wisconsin.  it worked quite efficiently, especially considering the
size and overall craziness of that party.

>disreguard the scumbag,looser part!)

geez.  i don't recall ordering a piping hot, jumbo-sized bowl of
pretension.  please, back to the old-skool kitchen with it.  it's one thing
to be dissatisfied with the current state of affairs in the scene; it's
quite another to look at everyone who is not a promoter/dj/producer/friend
of sleepy-c's as a worthless subspecies, whose only viable reason for
existence is to shell out their 20 bills every saturday.

>need to quit being the young spoiled brats your sounding like. If the
>parties are that much of a downer, STAY THE FUCK HOME!!

realize these are the people that put bread on your table, be it directly
or be it indirectly.  15-25 dollars is a lot to drop for a nite of
partying.  i think that the consumer-raver has every right to question if
what they are getting is worth it.

> Back in the day, it was understood that the parties we were going to, were
>outlaw events, we were lucky to have running water at most spaces. And we

well, for one thing, "back in the day" parties were not so expensive.  kids
were not so accustomed to things as they are now.  things change - for
better or for worse, the change is inevitable.

>GO TO SHOW,HEAR DANCE MUSIC, DANCE, CREATE A VIBE, MEET PEOPLE, AND HAVE A
>GRAT FUCKIN TIME!!
>Nowhere in that idea are the words "complain" or "gripe alot" or "be a
>snotty little brat", nor are the words," take the scene, the artists and

i don't recall anyone mistaking anyone for a piece of rock.  ;P  anyway,
nowhere in that idea are the words "permits", "3000 dollar dj's", "25
dollar parties", "expo centers", "concert venues", "shady
promoters/kids/drug dealers/drug addicts", etc etc etc.  yet they are all
undeniable facets of the present day rave scene.  i'm all for the old skool
ideaology, but i'm not sure how well it translates into the now.
especially when you espouse certain aspects of the new skool while
rejecting others.  changing with the times may be in order, as may be
sticking to the original idea, more or less 100% of the time.

>I'm not going to get into this right now, because I feel it will fall on
>deaf ears, but take the time to see how much work goes into an event, and

if someone takes the time, energy, or even the mere thought process
neccessary to "complain", it is obviously at least *somewhat* important to
them.  however trivial to you, try to remember you aren't the only one
here.

>Sorry to be a downer, but that's the way it is!
>droppin the reality of a scene that I love,but at the moment is making me sick!

it certainly is reassuring to know that if i'm ever in doubt about the
scene, sleepy-c will be there to guide me back to the path, and tell me
"the way it is".  because, of course, there's no room for differing
opinions.

  THE PERSON I WAS TALKING ABOUT HAS GIVEN ME NOTHING BUT TROUBLE SINCE I
FIRST ENCOUNTERED HIM ON THE NET. ALL HE EVER DOES IS COMPLAIN ABOUT
TRIVIAL LITTLE CRAP. NOW IF A PARTY HAD 1 OUT OF 5 DJ'S SHOW, SHIT FOR
SOUND AND NO LIGHTS AND CHARGED YOU $20,, COMPLAIN YOUR HEAD OFF, YELL YELL
YELL, BUT IF YOUR WHOLE FRUSTRATION COME'S DOWN TO THE FACT THAT YOU
COULDN'T BRING IN A WATER BOTTLE, OR GO OUTSIDE, KEEP IT TO YOUR SELF!
THAT'S WHAT IM SAYING. GOOD PROMOTERS HAVE 10000 THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT, AND
IF A LEGAL SPACE IS AVAILABLE, THAT WILL INSURE A 100% BUST PROOF PARTY,
BUTT, THERE'S NO RE-ADDMISSION, OR NO WATERBOTTLES ALLOWED IN, GIVE THE
DUDE SLACK. IT WAS DONE IN THAT SPOT FOR YOU THE RAVER. I MEAN WOULDN'T YOU
RATHER DANCE TILL 8AM, THAT GET SEWNT HOME BY THE MEN IN BLUE AT 2AM??

420 #1,420#2, SMILE TOUR, MUSIC 1, MUSIC 2, REBIRTH 1, REBIRTH 2, ROAD TO
420, AUTECHER,NIGHT WITH LAURENT GARNIER.... ALL HAD LOTS OF PEOPLE
SNEAKING IN, AND I HAD GOOD SECURITY, I'M TALKING LIKE 20 - 30 PEOPLE
CLIMBING WALLS AND GETTING IN FROM THE ROOF!!?? AND 100 OR MORE COPYING
STAMPS, OR WRISTBANDS. AND YES I HAVE TRIED LITTLE TICKETS, AND IT WORKS
FOR A WHILE, UNTILL A PACK OF 10 KIDS WANT TO GO OUT ALL TOGETHER, AND IF
YOU DON'T LET THEM, THEY SWEAR ONE WILL DIE, UNLESS THEY CAN GET TO THEIR
CAR..... YOU GET THE IDEA.

THAT'S NOT THE POINT, THE POINT IS I USUALLY DON'T MAKE A CENT ON SHOWS, IN
FACT IF I LOOSE ONLY $1000 I CONSIDER THE SHOW A SUCCESS, SO WHEN KIDS
DON'T PAY, SNEAK IN OR WHAT EVER, IT JUST HURTS ME , NOT REALLY ANYONE
ELSE.SO I TAKE IT A LITTLE PERSONLY.
IF KIDS WOULD THINK OF A PARTY IN THIS FASHION, WHEN YOUR YOUNG AND YOU
SHOPLIFT SOMETHING FROM K-MART, IT'S A BAD THING TO DO, BUT YOUR NOT REALLY
AFFECTING ONE SINGLE PERSON. BUT IF YOU GO TO POP'S SUDS AND CHIPS, AND RIP
HIM OFF IT'S ACTUALLY HURTING POP!!IT'S COMMING OUT OF HIS POCKET. SO THINK
OF YOUR GOOD FRIENDLY PROMOTERS AS "POP" ;)
NO ONE IS WORTHLESS UNLESS THEY PROVE THEM SELVES WORTHLESS. MAN INFACT I
FEEL THAT EVERY KID THAT ACTUALLY PAID TO GET INTO THE SHOW IS ACTUALLY
PART OF THE SHOW. BY PAYNG HE IS  SUPPORTING THE EVENT, SAYING YES I
BELIEVE IN YOUR PRODUCTION COMPANY, I KNOW I'LL HAVE FUN, AND I KNOW I'LL
GET MY MONEY'S WORTH.
IF YOUR NOT SURE , SAVE YOUR LOOT AND DON'T GO TO A SHOW.
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A THREE STRIKES AND YOUR OUT RULE FOR
PROMOTERS.EVERY PROMOTER CAN HAVE THREE BAD SHOWS, (BECAUSE SOMETIMES STUFF
HAPPENS THAT IS BEYOND YOUR CONTROLL, AND PEOPLE DO MAKE MISTAKES) BUT IF
IT'S MORE THAN 3 BOGUS SHOWS IN A 2 YEAR PERIOD, BAMM THEY GET THE NO SHOW
ATTENDANCE!!

BREAD ON MY TABLE!?? MAN IN THE LAST 6 YEARS I HAVE LOST ABOUT $35,000
DOING PARTIES!! I GOT NO BREAD ON MY TABLE. SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY I'M DUMB
FOR DOIN SHOWS IF I LOOSE $$, BUT THE REASON I LOOSE THE $$ IS THAT I GIVE
A SHOW THAT IS WORTH THE $$. IT WOULDN'T BE HARD TO THROW A $25 SHOW AND
ONLY NEED 350 KIDS TO BREAK EVEN, BUT THAT'S A BUDGET THAT DOSEN'T ALLOW
YOU TO GIVE A GREAT SHOW, INSTEAD I CHOOSE TO TRY A BRAK OF 1200 KIDS,
GIVING THE KIDS A SHOW THAT IS WORTH $20 - $25. SO TO ANSWER YOU, 20 - 25
DOLLERS IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE KIDS, BUT WHAT ABOUT $25,000 FROM ME FOR
A PARTY FOR 1 NIGHT, THAT IF NOT ONE SOUL SHOWS UP FOR I STILL HAVE TO PAY
FOR??!! THE RISK DIFFERENCE IS A LITTLE GREATER ON MY SIDE, NO????

I LOVE CHANGE, BUT THE ATTITUDE OF THE KIDS LATELY HAS CHANGED FOR THE WORSE.
NOT ALL, BUT A MAJORITY ARE JUST ATTITUDE FUELED KIDS!! THEYT HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT A PARTY IS ABOUT, ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS THE OTHER STUFF.(TOO MUCH
OTHER STUFF TO LIST!)
AND THE PRICE OF DJ'S IS GETTIN EXTREAM, BUT ALSO REMEMBER, THAT IF A DJ
KNOWS 1000 PEOPLE WILL COME TO HEAR JUST HIM, AND THE PARTYS $20, HE'S
MAKING THE PROMOTER $20,000. SO IF HE ASKS FOR A FEE OF $2000 THAT'S ONLY
10% OF WHAT HE DID FOR THE PROMOTER THAT NIGHT. BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY DJ'S
WHO ARE CHARGING TOO MUCH MONEY THAT REALLY CAN'T COMMAND IT, SO WITH THAT
POINT I AGREE WITH YOU.

WELL, LET ME JUST SAY THIS, WHEN YOU HAVE SENATORS,MAYORS AND MEN IN BLUE
IN YOUR BUSINESS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE YOU DO PARTIES, WHEN YOU HAVE A
PERMIT BEING PULLED FOR NO REASON, ON A PARTY THAT COSTS $125,000.00, YOU
GET A BIT STRESSED, SO WHEN SOMEONE BRINGS UP A WATER BOTTLE, I JUST CAN'T
SEE HOW THAT IS A PROBLEM??!!
EVEN THE MAIN PEOPLE OF THE SCENE (YOU THE RAVERS) HAVE MORE TO WORRIE
ABOUT THAN THAT, GETTING GOOD DIRECTIONS, MAKING SURE YOU SEE YOUR FAVORITE
DJ, AND DON'T MISS HIS/HER SLOT, MAKING A NEW FRIEND, FIND OUT WHAT THAT
LAST RECORD WAS THAT MADE YOU GO NUTS!! SO WITH ALL THAT PLUS A PILE MORE,
A WATER BOTTLE...????? ;)

THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR DIFFERING OPIONIONS, BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT
OUR SCENE IS HAVING A WEIRD TIME RIGHT NOW, AND AS A SCENE I THINK WE  NEED
TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE BIGGER ISSUES, THE ISSUES THAT NEED EVERYONES
INPUT, AND IDEAS, BUT THE SMALLER THINGS LIKE WATERBOTTLES AND RE-ENTRY,
MMMMMMMMMMM
I CAN'T SEE THOSE BEING A BIG ISSUE!??
I GUESS I WILL ALWAYS ADD THIS NOW: IN NO WAY, ARE THESE  THE OPINIONS OF

Tommorow at approx 3pm EST, there will be the premiere airing of 'Head Set',
one of 3 new Techno/Dance/Experimental mix shows on http://www.netcast.com

You'll need to download the Netcast Plug-in, it's a high-q multicast service
that bypasses the limited number of simultaneous listeners associated with
RealAudio.

Please try to listen if you can, and let us know what you think! :)

well i have nothing more to say on the subject, tho i'm sure you'll

 (city officials/cops  don't like that, and it seems to cause lot's of
problems with them when throwing events. I would rather have a party last,
than have people bring in water bottles. i think, they think we can hide
substances in our water??)

 (once again, it's the city/cops that don't allow the bags. think about how
many kids conceal drugs/?? in their bags. also weapons, now i know that
there isn't that much concern about weapons, but as the scene get's bigger,
so does the idea that people from outside the scene will attend. I would
hate to see a kid get shot because a scum bag brought in a weapon in

(it depends if it's something I can controll. If it was , "yo we don't like
that much techno...." find i'll change it, if it was "ya know we would
really like to see more intella beams instead of data flashes" i'd do it,
or anything that could be done without pissing off the alread overly
resentful authorities. kids have to realize that we are less than a hair
away from these parties being banned all together!! So when kids complain
about how water bottles can't be brought in, and make a stink about it, it
hurts me that the promoter's had to sit through countless hours of
meetings, and inspections to even get the party to happen, and here are
these kids crabbin about water bottles.
But also because of this water bottle restriction, promoters should never
charge $3 for a 20 oz size water!! At all my shows we charged $2 for the
big waters, and we bought the water at sams club for like $1.25, and we let
the people who sold the water for us keep the 75 cent profit.

I could if i wanted to, run my parties more like my other business, but
that's not the point. I could be making lots of money off the shows (less
dj's,less lights,less sound, less everything) but I don't because I try to
give all I can for the $20. I want people to be in the show confident that
there $20 was spent on a show that should have been $30. (I also like and
throw smaller shows for $3- $5 and that's an awsome vibe and good time, but
an ocassional biggie is dope, as long as it's worth it!) The only
questionable shows I have ever thrown, were 420, and 420ver2, and both
times I worked with Spawntaneous. But besides that , all my other shows
were well attended,had incredible vibes and 95% of the people that attended
had a great time, (I have countless letters from people expressing the
great time thay had.) So i also  have learned from my mistakes, what do I
get for doing the best show I can?? i get a great feeling from the kids who
attended and had a great time which makes it all worth it, but then  a few
people (2%) take that feeling away from me by complaining about
waterbottles, backpacks ect or sneaking in. Man that hurts. I'm sure it
hurts all promoters that give it thier all.

And i guess I pick on you because you almost never seem to have anything
positive to say ever! I guess that's your right, and I shouldn't slag you
for it, but sometimes I get this big lump in my stomach when I read a
posting and I just gotta type, or I will just feel bummed all day. I just
put a whole lot into this "scene" of ours, and I know alot of other people
put alot in as well, so when I see people complaining about trivial things
it just sets me off.
Once again sorry to center my anger on one person,

god love ya steve but the caps have GOT to go.  use for emphasis only.

these posts have summarized the essential problems of the rave scene as it
currently exists in our area.  i'm glad we're talking about it.

but these personal attacks are bound to get us nowhere.  i have never seen
this list become so combative, especially among three people i personally
know and consider my friends. 

not that anyone's done anything wrong--everyone has had good things to
say, in fact--but steve, jamie, michael, i don't want to see this
escalate.

yes, there are shady ravers.  yes, there are shady promoters.  yes, DJs
are charging too much.  yes, events are incredibly hard to throw.  and so
on.  the question remains, what do we do?  those of us who have a "say" in
throwing events need to answer this question.  those of us who attend
events have a right to ask it, or suggest directions to go.

so instead of getting personal i'm suggesting we stop this now and turn it
into something more constructive.  all three of you already know what I'M
doing to address these issues, but i sure as fuck can't save this stupid
scene all by myself!  and to those of you listmembers who are reading
this, let's hear you chime in...this is no time to be sleeping

One can usually pick them out of a crowd.  They're the ones who hardly 
leave the bathroom.

> yes, there are shady promoters.

Again, it's kinda easy to pick out what is true and likely on a flyer and 
what is not.  "First time ever in your area" by a promoter you never 
heard of before?  VERY UNLIKELY.  If you see a big name on a flyer for a 
party thrown by a crew you don't recognize as a local, then most likely 
that big name DJ will not be there!

> yes, DJs  are charging too much. 

Well, there are a lot of good local DJs in most cities that don't get to 
spin as often as they should, for no reason other than name recognition.  
Nowdays, with Internet distribution and bigger labels, records aren't all 
that hard to find, so it's not like the tune selection will be all that 
different between a local and a national DJ.  Dubplates and live PAs are 
more valuable than a big name in my book.  I want to hear new shit!

> yes, events are incredibly hard to throw.  

This is the most true of all statements.  The police and other authority 
organizations are becoming more and more difficult to appease, permits 
are a bitch to obtain, and new spaces that are raver proof are hard as 
hell to find.  I cringe every time I hear of a new space, only to read 
the review of it the next day here on PB-CLE describing all of the 
tagging that happened on the bathroom walls, etc.  See "Shady Raver" 
section above:-)

> the question remains, what do we do? 

Pirate radio, renegade parties and small club nights.  Really, I don't 
give a fuck about lasers or 50 gazillion watt sound systems, I like to be 
able to see the DJ, find some space to dance or chill out somewhere once 
in a while ... that's all that a party really needs to attract me.  I've 
had great times at large events, and just as much fun at little 
gatherings.  Whatever and wherever the event, as long as friendly people 
and good vibes are there ... well, you all know the cliche.

love,
Toby

what... but why can't you dance and have fun all day. ok its hot, real hot
when you do that [ex. busy last summer.. fun. but hot]
we could just throw the whole rave thing, and run back to the house.. chill
in small groups and enjoy the music and fun in the safty of our own homes?
i have a roomate who works so much, he can't go to partys, so sometimes he
thorws in a smallin disc.. and busts out in his room...
techno music is having problems.. real problems.. and its not the
commersialization of it.. [woo, SP on that one] most of the producers i know
are running from raves.. "to much trouble and shit"
vapourspace is going on tuoutr with some Folk singer [ricki lee jones  i
think]
weird... 
anywho.. i don't think i have a point... just don't sweat raving so much..
its not ment to be a way of life, just something to do. enjoy it if its there
to enjoy. cause it'll suck if it ain't.

Day raves for the most part are subdued, laid back and seldom attract that
many people. Out of the 10 or so I have been to only 1 actually was able
to pull it off to any degree. Most of them were dismal failures. One to
the tune of 20,000 dollars even though it started in the day and ended in
the early morning. (this was in the DC area and the party shall remain
naimless) It had cool lasers, glow balls great sound and projections in
both rooms, an outside space and a bunch of other stuff but it failed to
attract enough people. My theory is that partying and night go hand in
had. People want to kick back after work (most people work in the day) 
and partying in forever linked to nightlife (and yes sometimes drugs are a
part of nightlife), after all, how many clubs are open during the day?????
It didn't start with raves and it didn't start with disco, hell, it didn't
even start with Jazz in the 40's it's been the way for at least the last
1,000 years or so.  As they say the freaks come out at night. People are
more comfortable to let loose etc.

Metalheadz are doing a North American Tour. Should be reliable if the
local promoters are.

The tour comes through Vancouver on July 8 at Sonar, 66 Water Street. The
Logical Progression tour opens this new club on July 1. That will be a
smooth ending to Canada Day! Andy B, Vancouver's finest jungle DJ will
also have a weekly there. Finally, a decent sized club with a jungle
weekly in this city. Going to be a good summer.

Later,
Geoff

Interested parties are looking into this possibility but how can any
current promoter justify it when they have all have lost alot of $.
The only crew I could see being able to pull it off would be the people
doing Steel City. They have the most going for them.


1. jungle friendly crowd
2. a bust proof space 
3. a good reputation
4. a good amount of advertising

Hi,

I'm organizing a picnic for Saturday, June 28, in the Cleveland
Metroparks.  The cost is one, big, happy smile per attendee!

Interested?

The location I've secured is the South Chagrin Reservation (adjacent to
the Chagrin River near Miles Rd. and S.O.M, Ct. Rd.). 

It's a good location because there are plenty of fields for playing games,
swings, excellent trails and a covered picnic area.

If you would like to attend (and all you non-Clevelanders are definitely
welcome too), e-mail me with your snail mail address, and I'll send you
out a map and all the details. 

By the way, here are some ideas for games we can play (depending on how
many people register):

* Capture the Flag

* Ultimate Frisbee

* Kickball

{E-mail me with your vote and or other selections}

Although the picnic is totally free, I would encourage people to bring
food, boomboxes, suntan lotion, frisbees, balls, ect.

The raindate will be Sunday, June 29 at the same location.

Please e-mail me right away if you would like to attend!

Sincerely,

Braden

"BUSY CHILD" THE CRYSTAL METHOD'S NEW SINGLE

>>From the moment the addictive "Keep Hope Alive"  and "Now Is The Time" hit
the clubs, you're ears have probably been craving more from the infamous
Las Vegas duo (Ken Jordan & Scott Kirkland).  Well, wait no more, it's
finally here.  "Busy Child" is the new  single from their debut album
"Vegas".

Although it's only just hit the streets on white label (and Astralwerk's MTV
Amp compilation), "Busy Child" has already been getting some serious
attention and making Crystal believers out of everyone.  Because our
intrepid heroes have been working hard playing clubs and raves across
America, this single is destined to pave the way for the success of
homegrown, American electronic music.

Fully loaded with an awesome remix by Anaheim's mighty Uberzone, the 12"
is available now on the supercool LA label, City Of Angels and the CD
single will hit the streets on June 17 on Outpost/Geffen.

So for now, "Busy Child" will have to tide you over until the release of
their full length LP ("Vegas" hits the stores on July 29) or until the boys
invade a city near you.  So lock up your daughters, check out their website
(http://www.randommedia.com/thecrystalmethod) or e-mail Pam at
VegasTCM@aol.com for more info.

side). 

WHEN:  Saturday, June 28 from 1:30 to 6:00 P.M. (rain date is Sunday, June
29 at the same times).

COST:  One big happy face (actually, this is optional)

BRING:  Food, fun, blankets, sunscreen lotion, old telephone books (for

Hope to see you there!

Anybody making the trip?  Please get in touch with me if you are.
I'd love to be there...don't know if I have the money, but if someone is
making the trip and has room, I can probably get it.

Supposedly logical progression is not having any dates except the big
cities, but i don't know about metalheadz.  I'd definitly like to hear
them @ steel city.  Ram (Andy C, Darren J..etc) is also on tour, and I
think there is another formation tour happening later this summer...I'll
definitely mention it to promoters I see.

The only problem I can see is the fees these tours are asking for an
appearance - these are big djs from the UK == big $$ I'm sure.  If they
had a special steel city at another bigger venue or on a friday or sat
night they could probably get the draw, but I doubt it on a tuesday.

Still'd be cool though.  See you kids tomarrow night. :)

Dear Trout, 
If you really feel this way I will not post this information.  I would like
to say, however, that we get inquiries from people in Pittsburgh very
frequently, as it is only 4 hours away.  And Lots of people from your list do
come down to Buzz, as I recognized their names from poking around in the
archives.  Do people on your list really mind hearing about a rave event less
than 5 hours away?  I find that hard to believe, as I often travel to NYC,
Philly, and several other cities...   If we stretch the boundaries of where
we promote all that is accomplished is the scene gets stronger.  You must
know that we have Dieselboy, a Pittsburgh original, quite often,
matter-of-fact he is tag teaming this Friday with Scott Henry at Old Skool
Buzz (6-20-97).  Out of respect to you, I will not post Buzz or Sting
lineups, if you still feel it is irrelevant, but I think it is sad to censor
a list.

ok, here's one that has been bugging me on and off for over a year and
seems to be worse now in recent months.

out of area posts.  I.E. new york, canada, washington d.c., california,
texas, etc....

there are pros and cons.

pros:  alot of these are big camping weekend things worth the drive, (the
texas thingy), some post up webcasts, real audio, or other www resources.
you can know about further away events and the like.

cons: alot of bullshit commercialism: here, look, buy my records and
glowsticks....  weekly events being posted from DC and NYC, frat parties
from california.....  my 'D' key has no lettering left on it ....

i asked for opinions before on this and the conversation petered out real
quick.  i want to hear what you think, because, quite frankly it annoys me
and i'd like to close the list up to subscribers only.  i haven't figured
out a way to just prevent certain people from posting, since there are only
about 7-10 main culprits.

it has been pointed out to me by buzzdc@aol.com that:
"If we stretch the boundaries of where we promote all that is accomplished
is the scene gets stronger."
my spin on it is, subscribe to dc-raves. ne-raves, mw-raves, boston-raves,
or any of the others if you want that information, pb-cle-raves is in my
opinion for pb-cle and 2-3 hours drive from there.  dayton is really the
only one i let slide in frequently.  i personally would like to change the
name to 
pb-cle-cols-raves  =)

think wisely, and reply... I WANT SOME FEEDBACK ON THIS!!!! 

FLAMES FORWARDED TO /dev/null .......   trouty.

so this woman in cincinnati just got arrested.  she left her home and
children in a horrible state of neglect due to her "internet addiction".  i
guess it was really gross, the kids living hungry in their own waste, the
whole apartment unthinkably smelly and dirty except for her clean computer
area.  funny thing was, they gave a list of symptoms of "internet addictive
disorder" and when you should be worried about loved ones showing these
characteristics.  i fit them all, and i'm sure a number of you do too...

"my name is michael, and i'm an internetaholic?"

take two of these and thank me in the morning,

trouty sez-

"my spin on it is, subscribe to dc-raves. ne-raves, mw-raves, boston-raves,

opinion for pb-cle and 2-3 hours drive from there. "

I say-

Well in my opinion, I agree completely with this.  And I think the
best part of a regional list is that it is, in fact, REGIONAL.  And
specific to our area. I like to check my mail, and check quickly
through stuff about my area, and not have to wade through gobs
of stuff that's way far away from me.  If I wanted to hear about
parties/raves/whatever in other areas, I'd subscribe to those
lists.  So...there's my two cents :)

  I am sorry that i posted a Toronto party, but
  i only posted it because i saw 187 on it and i

toronto...actually toronto wuz where i first bumped into joe 187
and damian when i made the trek w/ hossam way back in the day...
and toronto wuz where me & jeff stuff passed out tons o 420

police...just make sure u've got all yur legal documents and not
to act too suspicious or YOU WILL BE thoroughly searched and 
questioned @ the border

Sorry for the massive crosspost, but I thought this would appeal to just 
about everyone.  Please feel free to forward this to other lists that I may 
have left off.

A friend of mine recommended some fiction -- "The Ecstasy Club" by Douglas 
Rushkoff on HarperEdge/HarperCollins.   Summary on back:

"When the young, hypertalented idealists who call themselves Ecstasy Club 
find an abandoned piano factory in Oakland, they make it the focus of a 
round-the-clock rave the likes of which they Bay Area has never seen before. 
 They also make the factory a base camp in their search for a method of time 
travel that combines computer wizardry, esoteric spirituality, and 
mind-altering substances.  The Club's mesmeric leader, Duncan, and our 
resourceful narrator, Zach, actually manage to 'break time' online, only to 
discover that an unsettling array of characters has beat them to it. 
 Government agents, corporate saboteurs, religious zealots, and even the 
local cops are suddenly out  to get the Club.  As they battle an ingeniously 
conceived conspiracy (think Thomas Pynchon meets The X-Files), Zach battles 
his own growing affection for Duncan's lover, Lauren, and begins to wonder 
whether enlightenment is all it's cracked up to be."

I actually just started it so I have no idea how good it is.

no relevance? trout u said something about things within a 5 hour
area...teri is right, while technically the *event* isnt in the area, many
ppl on this list do attend the events and would like to be informed about
them.

no attitude here, im just telling ya what i think...i know u gotta limit
the scope, but balitmore/dc isnt texas or california....i think anything
with relevance should be allowed, list members making announcements of
events they are playing at (toronto, chicago, osaka japan for that matter)
maybe they are just proud+happy of what's going on and want to share...it's
a kinda hokey concept but there are ppl on this list who consider one
another 'friends' and who doesnt like to tell their friends whats up?


peace,
hossam

In a message dated 97-06-17 07:18:02 EDT, you write:

<< i personally would like to change the name to pb-cle-cols-raves  =) >>

Sounds like a good idea to me, Columbus has fat parties, even WPA-OHIO raves
list seems appropriate.... Here in Pittsburgh we always know about the
Columbus and Akron action anyway...

well my stance on this then is to subscribe to DC-raves.  that is what dc 
raves is for.  i like to know whats going on outside the area as well, 
thats why i subscribe to the ne-raves-calendar and mw-raves-calendar, but 
as soon as i say its ok to post up DC events then people who live half 
way between pgh and DC are going to want philly, then ppl between dc  and 
philly are going to want baltimore.  see my point.   i feel i have to do 
something now about it, before this gets out of hand--and i know i wont 
win any popularity contests for doing it.

well, those posts are rare, even damian & joe didn't post up events they 
are at.  _what_ i am concerned about is promoters from out of town who 
post them here.  there is someone posting about weeklies from NYC and 
someone else posting their weekly from DC, both say they have the right 
since ppl from pgh call their info lines.  ok, well by looking at the 
headers, they posted to every mailing list containing the word rave on the 
eastern half of the USA.... .  ..  .  also of ppl looking for rides, i 
dont care about them either, _if_ and here's the _if_ --- if they say hi, 
i'm looking for a ride to XXXXX event, not just drop it on the lists 
without an explaination.

> it's a kinda hokey concept but there are ppl on this list who consider one
> another 'friends' and who doesnt like to tell their friends whats up?
whats up locally is fine, or finding rides is fine. but if i dont say no 
out of area posts and set my foot down, every promoter is soon going to 
take advantage of the fact and tell us about their wonderful parties and 
weeklies all over the US.  like i said i already have ppl in NYC and DC 
trying to justify why they belong in the pb-cle area, but you dont hear 
me trying to justify why pb-cle belongs in the DC or NYC area....

....waiting for more input, ideas, or suggestions---trouty....

My $ on the effective radiated output of the PB-CLE list is this:  I've
been to more parties in the DC/B-More area than Colombus.  I don't mind
hearing about parties in other nearby cities (Toronto included), what I do
mind is spam from people in those regions offering things other than
parties.  Announcements about a big rave in DC are fine, since I'm likely
to make the trip down there, probably DJs from this area will be spinning,
my friends will likely be there, etc; posts about DJ Hardware's new
mixtape from Florida are not appreciated.  I mean, I understand that DJs
have to promote themselves, but spamming rave listserves is not my idea of
the right way to go about finding a new audience.  There is probably a
fine line between promoters who put on parties in other cities, and DJs
from other citites trying to find parties to spin at, but my suggestion is
this, as it has always been: close PB-CLE to subscribers only.  That way,
promoters will have to join the list to post, and you will be able to
administer the list more effectively by maitaining a user-account list.  A
subscriber list will allow you to filter posts from susbscribers who
demonstrate unsavory behavior, or you could boot them altogether.  That's
how Dom runs the breaks@xmission.com listserve, and it keeps the list
pretty much in line and focused. 

That is all ... c u @ steelcityjungle..........

Hi everyone.

I'm looking for a place that fixes and calibrates and spruces up
turntables in the Pgh area.  Reliable, good work, and reasonable prices.
Anyone have a suggestion of a place they trust to get audio stuff
repaired?

Thanks.
stephanie

I do have to agree with both Trouty and Brian...Matt and I are both
subscribed to all the regional lists throughout the US.  I love the fact
tgat we always knew what was going on everywhere BUT at the same time
getting the same message seven times tends to be a bit aggrevating. 	I
feel that I must defend the other side also though...for clubs such as
Buzz promote over the ne list, boston, dc, nyc etc...they know that people
come down from that area and DO in fact want the info on who is
spinning...while people from other lists do want to attend parties in
other regions they probably do not want the extra traffic on their
account, that could be a reason on why this MUST happen.  On her parties
such as the party that Jami Losurdo was promoting throughout the past few
months ("Spring Breaks") had people attend from Pittsburgh, Texas, Boston
etc while the party was in NYC...he did a wonderful job promoting her
event and it ended up being as great as she made it out to sound!  
	I guess I really have mixed emotions about this whole topic then,
I can see both points that both sides will make and yes we do need to
support each other to keep our scene going strong, we need it after all
the bad press we have been getting lately
Keep it strong.
Love-
Nicole

Re: closing the list, there are some good points, but sometimes breaks
turns into a reign of terror.  I remember a year ago being scared to death
to even open my mouth. Pb-cle always struck me as a friendly, responsible
list (although I've been gone for a while) and as long as people stay
responsible, there's no problem.  I think NE-Raves is the worst thing that
ever happened to net ravers.  I think people have picked up a lot of bad
habits from it, and things have gotten more permissive lately, for many
reasons other than just that list.

I still think it's possible to keep the list open and also keep it
manageable.  I would think that out-of-town promoters would listen to a
list-admin and honor that person's wishes.  If you think this list is
strict, read the Boston raves FAQ sometime.  It's hilarious.  Sounds like
my first grade nun wrote it.

yeah, that's what i've been getting at, but i recall tom did that and it 
didn't last too long for whatever reason--i cant seem to recall?
i just want to make it an open topic and hear out other solutions.  so 
far there haven't been any real answers, closing the list is not 
something i want to do, but i think that's what its going to come to...

still awaiting ideas.... trouty....

ok, close the list, keep it an open (loosely moderated) group thereafter
(ie only registered/subscribed members) and gently moderate it...if u wanna
join, fine, once u are in, feel free to do/say whats on your mind, abusers
get warned, slapped, then kicked out.

better?

peace,
hossam

well, actually that's the only workable solution i came up with, ideally 
what i wanted to do is to stop repeat offenders of spamming from posting, 
but the majordomo is not set up that way .... . .  for someone not on the 
list to post without subbing i have to put their name in a special file 
that wont filter out their messages.  there are ppl who have asked for 
posting permission and i tell em to have at it and dont abuse it.  i have 
noticed the ppl who ask are the ones who respect it the most.  it almost 
seems like the ppl that post up about the texas thing have a different 
email all the time (i think) ???
*sigh*  trouty...

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

let me open by saying this:

pb-cle-raves is *not* a high-traffic list!!

that said...what is the problem, exactly?  sure, parties from "out of the
area" are being posted.  but who does that hurt?  you have to delete them,
if you don't care. but if you do care, you get to be informed and possibly
even attend...in other words, you receive useful information, and i cannot
think of a better way to use a listserv.  it isn't like pb-cle is belching
out 400 posts a day about parties everywhere from east osh kosh to
sacramento.  they are usually at least somewhat relevant to the area in
question.

more importantly, the only person that really seems to have a problem with
it is trouty.  if the list as a whole exhibited a vehement opposition to
out-of-area posts, something would certainly need to be done.  but i think
the majority opinion of the list is what should be adhered to.  if it gets
to be a problem in the future, and ppl are complaining about it...close the
list.  this will get rid of a lot of it.

for now, i say leave it as it is.  i only see myself getting maybe 8-10
msgs a day from this list anyway...

take two of these and thank me in the morning,
michael

NO big up goes to WMSE who had claimed to have given me free tix to this
event, tix which i found out upon arrival DIDN'T EXIST.  so i had to
shell out $10.  it would have been worth it if i wasn't broke already.
humiliated at the entrance, i had to borrow money from my friend.

thought you all would like to know.

====================================================================

tee hee, u weren't the only one dissed @ the door this weekend...
sleepy c said he would put me on the list this past thursday for his
pre-wedding party @ the brillo pad...i get to the door & the door guy
says there is no guest list!...luckily my GF had my back...i later
got her back by treating her to lotsa mixed drinks @ the bar tho...and
to think i even volunteered to get sleepy c's story of what happened @
420 v2.0 on a web page!...despite the dissapointment @ the door
i still had a good time seeing lotsa old faces, especially gill who
finally moved in from chicago and chip of eyegasm, family of light
represent...speakin o which, where the hell were u, mr. ian mariano?
i wuz s'posed to pick up some software from yah!...all & all the party
wuz actually a steal @ $5 bones a head w/ dave trance & baggadonuts
layin down some killer tracks...i wuz just dissapointed becuz mr. Cinch
didn't keep his word, but i'm sure it wuz it had alot to do w/ pre-
wedding anxiety & what not...tee hee, i guess my only consolation wuz
passing out ed's Active Not Passive flyers, which coinkidinkly happened
the same night as Stephen's next gig :P...btw how wuz Active Not Passive,
Summer Jam '97 (the spawntaneous party sleepy c spun at this past friday

The place I hear of most often is Swissvale Music.  I think Bubbles took 
his stuff there once and was happy with the work.  Also, I think 
Hollowood services Technics as well.

i do not mind posts that tell about a big party from DC or anywhere in ohio
or pennsylvania. i do mind posts every week on weeklies from connecticut,
nyc, etc..

i think it is in the best interest of this mailing list to close it off to
subscriber posts only. any non-subscriber posts will go to the list admin's
mailbox and if he feels they are relevant, then he should bounce them to
the list. and if we still keep receiving all these crossposts, well then
there really isn't anything else to do but use the big D key. i do not have
a problem with that.

by creating a subscriber-post list, we are maintaining some boundaries
without becoming tyrannical. i highly doubt that pb-cle-raves will ever
reach the magnitude of any of the east coast lists or mw-raves for that
matter.

i had access to a color printer today and printed up 6 copies of the tag i
liked best off pete syskos page.  i'm gonna try and find someplace that
does good solid laminations, anyone know of any?  what i plan on doing is
printing out names, email & misc info on the backs and laminating it all
together.  i'll be charging a few bux for the laminations and clips (if i
can find some!)  email suggestions back this way.. . ... .

to see what there is goto: http://www.hyperreal.com/raves/pb-cle/badges/

active.not.passive, ele_mental's abstract and downtempo electronic music
event was a very rewarding and interesting experience.  it was held at the
Southside Settlement House, in the smaller building behind the two
staircases in the courtyard. i got there at about 11:30, just as Dac
Crowell was about to start up his 2 hour performace of 'Lascaux', as ed
described it on the flyer, 'a 2-hour evolving sonic tapestry'.  i think
that describes it the best; it was basically a 2 hour multi-layered
journey through harsh noises, gentle beats and lush atmospheric ambience.
it was really unlike anything i've ever heard or seen before, it was very
involving and you really had no choice but to listen intently to the
intricate and minute patterns that built upon themselves. not to mention
that this guy had a truly mindblowing amount of gear for this performace,
including one of those objects that you place your hands over and move
them around to change pitch (the name escapes me), but it was very cool to
see one of these incorporated into a pa.

next up; a shirtless, sweaty and sexy Dan Doormouse gave us over an hour
of 'earbleednoiseexperiments'.  hmm, how to describe...3 turntables
blaring out a variety of hardcore and gabber tracks, crazy sounds and
effects, and just straight out noise. add in a couple of channels of
looped noisey, static filled samples of phone converations, screams, and
animal mutilations, not to mention Dan's unique turntable techniques and
you have some pretty disturbing and very cool shit. the highlight of
course was when Dan took a small electric grider and proceeded to
completely grind off the needle and mangle the cartridge on one of his
turntables (it sounded very cool btw). towards the end of his set he
turned down the noise-collage a bit and pumped out a few of his homegrown
hardcore tracks, which got heads bobbing in the entire place.

as Dan started to fadeout of his set, the space was filled with the
tribal live drum beats from the band/collective/cult of Gaga.  they of
course were adorned in the sacred bubble-wrap ceremonial gowns and caps.
a couple of tribal drum beating sessions took place before a hailarous
sample was looped "put your faith in Gaga. believe in Gaga. Gaga guides
your life" (it was a sample of a tv preacher, and they were looping the
first syallable of god so it sounded like Gaga).  then one of the members
started preaching from what looked like the book of mormon, chanting
inbetween verses "this is the voice of Gaga!".  then the beats started
kicking in, some of them boarderline hardcore, others more gentle; all
layered in with tribal drum beating, yells, and of course the sounds of
metal being smashed and beaten. there was a large pile of scrap metal in
front of the band which was thrown, kicked, hit with large blunt objects,
and finally grinded with a large grinder.  somewhere in all of this there
was also a jazz improv jam, complete with sax and trombone. yeah, it was
very cool.

about this time the power blows, and everyone tries for about 30 mins to
get everything going again. i guess Gaga pretty much melted the fucking
breaker box, haha. well they finally got it going again, and Mary Watts
got on the decks and starting dropping some very smoov trip-hop beats. i
hung around for about half of her set, and ended up leaving sometime after
4.

i really wish more people came out to support this event. i guess around
150 people came out, probably about 40 or so of them clubbers from mekka
that i guess wanted to check out one of these 'rave things'. they were in
for a pretty big surprise when they walked in to see Gaga raising some
hell. but there were a nice mix of people, including some just flat out
strange ones (one person in a cape/wrestling mask) but everyone seemed to
have a fun time. it was fun time, everyone who didn't come out to support
this event missed out bigtime! laterz..

well, the night after active.not.passive i headed out to collective
intelligence's Funkenbumpen. i had a pretty good time at this party, but
it was all house. i don't partically get into house all that much, and
after 8 straight hours of it, it started to wear a little thin.  the space
was the Skate Town on the east side of columbus. a nice space for a party,
but the skating/dancefloor area was so huge it kinda broke everyone up and
made the dancefloor look empty even though there were several hundred kids
out there.  the sound was wasn't all that great, you could have a
conversation fairly easily just a few feet back from the speakers, and
when you got to the back of the space you could barley hear the bass. when
i got there (about 11:30) i could hear the bass pounding before i even got
out of my car, but i guess there were quite a few problems with the shoddy
wiring in the place, as the power blew a couple of times during the night,
forcing them to turn the levels down so it wouldn't happen again. the
lighting was rather annoying too; it switched back and forth between four
high powered strobe lights or 2 of those rotating rainbow-colored globes
that were mounted slightly above eye level...either way it got in your
eyes when you were on the floor.

Halo and Justin Long both got the place jumping.  Halo laid down a nice
set of funky house with some huge buildups and some really impressive
scratching skills. Justin Long tore it up though, really the only dj of
the night to venture into hard house, even throwing in some detroit tracks
(ala Jeff Mills) which made me happy. they both got to spin 1.5 hour sets
too, which was pretty cool.

all of the ohio area djs were pretty good too. Sense and Soul-O from the
Oak Street Crew kept everyone moving too. Sense on the funky/booty tip and
Soul-O laying down some deep house.  Moah Deep also delivered a smoothe
early morning house set.

all in all, well worth $10, but i'm not sure i could endure 8 solid hours
of house again. but, i guess it's what gets the kids to come out, and
there were well over 600 of em there. ah well, see everyone at Ascend on
the 28th (where there will be a jungle room ;) )

after he closed it, mad ppl bitched and complained and so tom reopened it,
if u are gonna close the list, u need to do a *MASSIVE* cross post repeated
at least two if not three times (once a week 2-3 weeks in advance) telling
ppl whats goign on, so the knobs arnt all confused like they were last
time...

like "HEY DC PROMOTERS, IF U  WANNA ADVERTISE YOUR GIGS, U GOTTA JOIN" and
then once in the list, they have to abide by the rules, like no more than
one post per week for the same event, etc.. transgressors get warned then
booted after 3 or more offences.



heres a nickel, keep the change :)

peace,
hossam

DJs on the list - send me your top 10 playlist with artist-title-label for
inclusion in my zine...if you dare!  And no, you don't have to spin out

once, and your playlist is accurate as far as content.

As for Trouty being the only person bothered, WRONG.  This has come up

why the closed list idea is up for debate again.

>>From the city that never sleeps, comes the band that never sleeps!

"BUSY CHILD" THE CRYSTAL METHOD'S NEW SINGLE

>>From the moment the addictive "Keep Hope Alive"  and "Now Is The Time" hit
the clubs, you're ears have probably been craving more from the infamous
Las Vegas duo (Ken Jordan & Scott Kirkland).  Well, wait no more, it's
finally here.  "Busy Child" is the new  single from their debut album
"Vegas".

Although it's only just hit the streets on white label (and Astralwerk's MTV
Amp compilation), "Busy Child" has already been getting some serious
attention and making Crystal believers out of everyone.  Because our
intrepid heroes have been working hard playing clubs and raves across
America, this single is destined to pave the way for the success of
homegrown, American electronic music.

Fully loaded with an awesome remix by Anaheim's mighty Uberzone, the 12"
is available now on the supercool LA label, City Of Angels and the CD
single will hit the streets on June 17 on Outpost/Geffen.

So for now, "Busy Child" will have to tide you over until the release of
their full length LP ("Vegas" hits the stores on August 25) or until the boys
invade a city near you.  So lock up your daughters, check out their website
(http://www.randommedia.com/thecrystalmethod) or e-mail Pam at
VegasTCM@aol.com for more info.

Not this Saturday but next Saturday, June 28th, you are cordially invited
to a PICNIC!

Where:  Cleveland Metroparks' South Chagrin Reservation -- Shelterhouse
Picnic Area.

Why:  Games, food, sun, fun, new faces and miles of excellent hiking
trails . . . all wrapped into one, good time.

Cost:  One, big, smiley face (frowny faces optional).  It's free so invite
all your friends!

Directions:  The main entrance to the South Chagrin Reservation lies on
S.O.M. Center Rd. (Route 91) between Miles Road and Cannon Road in Solon,
Ohio.  Route 91 is easily accessible from Fairmount, Cedar, Shaker Blvd.,
South Woodland or Chagrin Blvd.  Once you hit S.O.M. Ct. Rd., turn South
and continue until you pass Miles Rd.  The entrance to the park will be on
the left side / East side of the road.  Take this entrance road (Hawthorn
Parkway) until you reach the Shelterhouse Picnic Area.  It'll be on your
left.  If you reach the Squaw Rock Picnic Area, you've gone a few yards
too far.

N.B.:  The South Chagrin Reservation has 4 picnic areas, so be certain
that you go to the correct one -- the Shelterhouse Picnic Area.  Ours is
the only one with large fields, swings and a covered picnic area.  You'll
know you're in the right place if you see a telephone book recycling bin
on the left as you enter.  In fact, why don't you bring your old telephone
books for recycling while you're there? 

Suggestions for What to Bring:

* Food and Snacks
* Frisbees
* Kickballs, baseballs and baseball mitts
* Tennis Shoes
* Sunscreen Lotion
* Boomboxes and Mixtapes
* Blankets
* Shorts
* Cold Drinks

If you have any questions or would like a map snail-mailed to you, feel
free to e-mail me.  You may also reach my voice mail at: (216) 670-0380.

I hope to see all of you there!

Braden

Also try J.Rudy electronics repair up in Millvale.  They're in the phone
book.  They're not a music store, but rather a very competent consumer
electronics service shop.  I'm sure that they'd repair turntables...they
might do what you need.

Theremin.  Yeah, DACC's the shit.  You should see his post on the
Analogue Heaven list.  He's got a website at hyperreal...look under the
artist's section.  He has a **LOT** of gear...all the way from standard
physics' lab oscillators to a Fairlight workstation.  I really would've
liked to go to this, just to see/hear him play.  Also check out his
track on the IDM list's 'Threads' compilation.

Hmm.  An event centered around live music.  Imagine!
[can we say 'das projekthaus'?]

Just an interesting little side note...I saw a couple of months ago 
in an electronics magazine (Modern Electronics?) plans for a 
theramin...Also, for anybody in or visiting cleveland that is 
interested in them, they have a theramin at the great lakes science 
center..I don't think it's very fancy, can't make too many sounds but 
is still a ton of fun to play with ;)

  (F.A.T.E.F.97')
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk



I don't expect alot of you to come in from around the U.S. but some of you
may have friends or family here in Texas or may be visiting this part of the
country around July 12th and 13th. Thank you for your time and attention!!!
hope to see some of you out here!

Check out these URL's: < www.neosoft.com/~scooby/fatef97/ > or <
www.uix.com/fatef97/ >

sometimes they work, =( , Were updating them and trying to get the bugs out,
GOOD LUCK!

Hope that those help you,  if not here is the info anyway:

The purpose of this festival is to bring together for one weekend all the
major players in the Texas rave scene and showcase their talent all at one
location. I began work on this event in Dec of 96 and I have gotten
commitments from all the major players to come down to Austin to support
this festival. As a matter of fact EVERYONE including the Dj's and crew will
pay the camping fee of $10 for the weekend, other than that fee this event
is FREE. We could easly ask for 20 to 30 $$ for this line up. Most of the
crews on this line up throw their own parties often exceeding budgets of
$10,000 or more. This Festival will be held in Dripping Springs which is
about a 1 hour drive from downtown Austin. Dripping Springs is alot like
what you might expect, running spring fed creeks and beautifull hill country
surroundings. There isn't a home in a 2 mile radius from event site, very
secluded.

two of his tracks are also featured on a 100-minute tape compilation 
called TEXT 1, put out by our own 21/22 corporation.

the first ele_ment concert event occurred in aug 1995.  the first
ele_mental event to prominently feature live performances was SNOW*BALL in
dec 1993.  even before that, the proto-ele_mental cru consisted of a band
named BODY RELEASE and friends.  most of our parties/events have featured
live performances of various kinds, ever since.  this is no secret.

das projekthaus had nothing to do with it, in fact i've never even been to
pittsburgh.  but i'd like to hear more about what the projekthaus ppl are
up to, i only heard about them because amie (grrl13) said our events
sounded similar to theirs.  a possible collaboration in the air perhaps?? 

anti-ravers unite!  (RULP everyone)

i went down there to play at "children of the process" and it was
disorganized at best, but a helluva good time!  there were live acts and
djs on the ground floor and more djs on the 3rd floor.  the live acts were
me, skoop, 187, and farmer tea.  spontan80 and micah didn't show as i
recall???  not sure.
my roommate went nuts for skoops stuff, does he have a tape, i remember
someone saying he does?  i have a tape of my set if anyone cares.  sounds
kinda crappy, since there's no compression on the tape, it was only done on
the house system....  bummer.    the only dj upstairs i checked out was
grrl 13, smooth jungle stuff as i recall....

>anti-ravers unite!  (RULP everyone)
just out of curiousity, what is an anti-raver?

as a tie in to the live stuff, how is the pb-cle-area music tape coming
along?  i havent heard of it in awhile.  i wanted to send tea some of the
stuff off of my tape from the projekthaus to put on instead of the other
stuff i had sent before, but i dont have access to a good tape deck :(
grrrrrrr.

fyi, the projeckthaus info line is 412.661.MSKW ....

greetings...

i am happy to report that i am getting the next issue of Activated 
Magazine together. we were delayed in order for me to get a computer and 
software to be able to do the layouts and such. which meant that i had 
to actually go and get a real job. we are looking to release issue #8 in 
MID TO LATE JULY. if all goes as planned, issue #9 will be released in 
mid to late September.

because of the delay, we were forced to cancel most of the 
advertisements we had for this issue. now, we need to get a whole new 
batch to be able to pay for the printing and expenses. as before, and 
hopefully forever, Activated is totally free except for subscriptions. 
so, ads are definitely needed to keep Activated free. we currently print 
5,000 copies, which are sent to stores and promoters throughout the US 
and selectively in Canada. this figure could be higher if we get more 
ads. here are our current ad rates (based on one issue...we have 
discounts for multi-issue ads. contact for prices).

Back Cover-  $145
2 Pages- $175
Full Page- $105
1/2 Page- $75
1/4 Page- 45
Business Card- $30

For dimension sizes or custom sized ads please contact for prices. These 
prices reflect print-ready artwork (film, laser prints, halftones). If 
you need design work done, we can subcontract someone for you. Again,

greetings...

i am happy to report that i am getting the next issue of Activated 
Magazine together. we were delayed in order for me to get a computer and 
software to be able to do the layouts and such. which meant that i had 
to actually go and get a real job. we are looking to release issue #8 in 
MID TO LATE JULY. if all goes as planned, issue #9 will be released in 
mid to late September.

because of the delay, we were forced to cancel most of the 
advertisements we had for this issue. now, we need to get a whole new 
batch to be able to pay for the printing and expenses. as before, and 
hopefully forever, Activated is totally free except for subscriptions. 
so, ads are definitely needed to keep Activated free. we currently print 
5,000 copies, which are sent to stores and promoters throughout the US 
and selectively in Canada. this figure could be higher if we get more 
ads. here are our current ad rates (based on one issue...we have 
discounts for multi-issue ads. contact for prices).

Back Cover-  $145
2 Pages- $175
Full Page- $105
1/2 Page- $75
1/4 Page- 45
Business Card- $30

For dimension sizes or custom sized ads please contact for prices. These 
prices reflect print-ready artwork (film, laser prints, halftones). If 
you need design work done, we can subcontract someone for you. Again, 
please contact for prices.

as far as submissions, we are looking solid for issue #8, but we are 
always looking for anything anyone wants to send in for future issues, 
from any area. we love stuff on the sarcastic and humorous tip, so those 
styles are always welcome ;)  .. what should you send? party reviews,

Hello all-
	For those of you that don't know, we have been working on
a project called: RAVEDATA for the past year and a half.  The objective of
this project is to build a factual history of the United States rave
scene.  This project encompasses events, great people and their efforts.
	We plowed through all kinds of information and pulled out as many
items as we could BUT so many pieces are missing.  The following is a list
of areas where we desperately need everyone's help:
dj's with no cities, events with no location, events with no cities,
events with no admission price, events with no attendance, promoters with
no phone numbers, and PC phone numbers with no names.
	Although there are a great deal of "holes" that still need to be
filled, everyone has been doing a great job on helping us find this
information. We realize scrolling through these lists can be a headache, but 
with your direct help we will be able to completing our task (bringing
all the information up to date).  As a result of this the page will be up
even sooner than we expected.
	We can't thank you enuff for your support!  If you haven't done so
already, stop on by and check it out at:
		http://www.partnercomm.com/~raveinfo/
Love ang Hugz-
Nicole & Matt
(Angel & Cyphonix)

i did not mean for "anti-raver" to necessarily sound like a proposition
_against_ ravers per se.  i'm not really anti-rave in a general sense.

i meant it more in the "anti-matter" sense, as in, things that are
intended to sabotage and destroy everything i can't stand about raves:
drug (ab)use, candy shit, the glorification of childishness, easy PLURy
happy smiley-face answers to life's difficulties, the "life = party"
mentality, the "art-is-for-pretentious-gits" mentality, etc.

perhaps a better term would be "bizarro raver."  if you'll recall, in
superman's gallery of villains there is a character named bizarro, who
looks like a skewed, zombied-out version of superman.  he comes from a
universe which is a skewed, zombied-out version of superman's: the earth
is square, down is up, etc.  on second thought, maybe "anti-raver" 
works...bizarro was kind of a dummy. 

all i'm saying is that those of us who want to shed the things we hate
about the rave scene should get together and do something about it.

RULP!

This "used shit for sale" bullshit is an excellent example of why the 
list should be subsription based and moderated.  

Once again, I vote for you to do as you think is necessary, Trout.

Still have side two to complete.  I'll try and get back into the studio 
this week and finish it up.  MSKW is waiting on the final song order 
until he makes the J-Cards, but otherwise ... it's coming along slowly.

Trouty, yup, I've got two tapes available:  "datamation" and
"oneyeardown".  See my website for details:
http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/1063 --> click the 'music' link.  I'll
make sure that anyone who wants either tape gets one.  I'd be interested
in trading tapes.  I'm also going to have a track on the upcoming local
tape comp.

I don't understand what you are saying . . . by "doing something about 
it" are you talking about killing candy-ravers, beating people up that 
take drugs and stopping people from expressing their feelings?  What 
makes your definition of what the rave scene should be like right?  I'm 
not the kind of person that you are talking about, but why don't they 
have a right to exist?  What makes you and people that agree with you the 
rulers of the rave scene?  And what is wrong with Peace Love Unity and 
Respect?  It seems to me that if all ravers shared this belief,  raves 
would not be the gathering of shady-ass-people that it is currently 
leaning towards.

well i asked tom why he reopened the list, it was not due to people
complaining, it was due to all the bounced mail that ended up in his
mailbox.  when i get around to it, i will be closing the list to
subscribers.  so if anyone cares, get the word around, because i'll prolly
be hitting the "D" key alot come this summer.....

i think he meant to NOT BE like the cliche raver and be yourself instead.
i agree with everything mentioned with the anti-raver deal.

(If this message duplicated itself for some reason, let me know)

	Hey hey all, it's me again.  Thanks to everyone who tuned into the Black
Lodge/White Lodge broadcast.  Psychic Warriors ov Gaia, Stacey Pullen, and
everyone else who was DJing that night though it was really great that
people all over the world could tune in, and they're glad everyone enjoyed
their sets.  The organizers and everyone involved thought it was really
cool as well.

    Another live broadcast is happening, this time on a smaller scale.
Next week on Wednesday at 11PM eastern, I will be borrowing the use of my
friend's Real Audio server and putting on a live-to-net concert from my
basement using Real Audio 3.0.  If you have fast enough computer (I think
minimum requirements are a 486/66), a 28.8 PPP or SLIP connection, and a
soundcard, you can tune in.  Check out http://www.io.org/~andrewm/pots to
download the software you need, and also to read up on how I'm going to do
this.
    The concert will probably be about an hour to two hours long, depending
on how much material I decide to play.  Probably about half or more of it
will be unreleased/live material using a mix of MIDI equipment and
tracking.  The styles will cover almost everything from ambient to
Rotterdam.  I'm consistently inconsistent when it comes to genre's :)
    If you're interested in tuning in, email andrewm@io.org with the
subject "POTS" and you'll be emailed back some details, and also put on an
outgoing-only email list.  This way I can send you up-to-the-minute
information on how the concert is progressing, if the date has changed,
etc, etc.

    Again:
   - http://www.io.org/~andrewm/pots - POTS web page, software,
     details
   - email: andrewm@io.org subject: POTS - Subscribe to the
     mailing list (very low traffic, don't worry)

This Saturday, June 28th, you are cordially invited to a PICNIC! 

Where:  Cleveland Metroparks' South Chagrin Reservation -- Shelterhouse
Picnic Area.

Why:  Games, food, sun, fun, new faces and miles of excellent hiking
trails . . . all wrapped into one, good time.

Cost:  One, big, smiley face (frowny faces optional).  It's free so invite
all your friends!

Directions:  The main entrance to the South Chagrin Reservation lies on
S.O.M. Center Rd. (Route 91) between Miles Road and Cannon Road in Solon,
Ohio.  Route 91 is easily accessible from Fairmount, Cedar, Shaker Blvd.,
South Woodland or Chagrin Blvd.  Once you hit S.O.M. Ct. Rd., turn South
and continue until you pass Miles Rd.  The entrance to the park will be on
the left side / East side of the road.  Take this entrance road (Hawthorn
Parkway) until you reach the Shelterhouse Picnic Area.  It'll be on your
left.  If you reach the Squaw Rock Picnic Area, you've gone a few yards
too far.

N.B.:  The South Chagrin Reservation has 4 picnic areas, so be certain
that you go to the correct one -- the Shelterhouse Picnic Area.  Ours is
the only one with large fields, swings and a covered picnic area.  You'll
know you're in the right place if you see a telephone book recycling bin
on the left as you enter.  In fact, why don't you bring your old telephone
books for recycling while you're there? 

Suggestions for What to Bring:

* Food and Snacks
* Frisbees
* Kickballs, baseballs and baseball mitts
* Tennis Shoes
* Sunscreen Lotion
* Boomboxes and Mixtapes
* Blankets
* Shorts
* Cold Drinks

If you have any questions or would like a map snail-mailed to you, feel
free to e-mail me.  You may also reach my voice mail at: (216) 670-0380.

I hope to see all of you there!

Braden

 parties at penn state are okay, but not very big and not very promoted. im
out of the loop up there though cuz im back in pittsburgh.. theyre probably
be some cool events sceduled for the fall of 97 there but i really couldnt
tell you how to find out about them except maybe check the record stores
and coffee shops for flyers ... i think you got misinformation about
KRS-ONE, cuz i dont think he was there..then again there are a lot of
people up there so it may have happened. we had a phat gig in this space
called art of the ages...thats where johnny blistah was (i think thats who
you reffered to)  .... but as you can see, we dont really pull that many
center pennsylvanians...mostly students, so its a bit cheesy and high
school kids never show up (they should)...anyway gotta jet

peace

Hi,

It looks like the weather will behave so the picnic is definitely on for
tomorrow at the South Chagrin Reservation.  I would just like to remind
all who are coming that they should bring their own food and beverages.
I'm going to bring a few items like frisbees and balls, but plan on
bringing that sort of stuff too.  The more the better it will be!

I'm going to include the directions and general info once again with this
e-mail.  If any of you have specific questions, please reach me at my
apartment (216) 321-5765 after 6:00 P.M.

I hope to see you tomorrow at the Shelterhouse Picnic Area from 1:30 to
6:00ish (we can stay later).

Braden


This Saturday, June 28th, you are cordially invited to a PICNIC! 

Where:  Cleveland Metroparks' South Chagrin Reservation -- Shelterhouse
Picnic Area.

Why:  Games, food, sun, fun, new faces and miles of excellent hiking
trails . . . all wrapped into one, good time.

Cost:  One, big, smiley face (frowny faces optional).  It's free so invite
all your friends!

Directions:  The main entrance to the South Chagrin Reservation lies on
S.O.M. Center Rd. (Route 91) between Miles Road and Cannon Road in Solon,
Ohio.  Route 91 is easily accessible from Fairmount, Cedar, Shaker Blvd.,
South Woodland or Chagrin Blvd.  Once you hit S.O.M. Ct. Rd., turn South
and continue until you pass Miles Rd.  The entrance to the park will be on
the left side / East side of the road.  Take this entrance road (Hawthorn
Parkway) until you reach the Shelterhouse Picnic Area.  It'll be on your
left.  If you reach the Squaw Rock Picnic Area, you've gone a few yards
too far.

N.B.:  The South Chagrin Reservation has 4 picnic areas, so be certain
that you go to the correct one -- the Shelterhouse Picnic Area.  Ours is
the only one with large fields, swings and a covered picnic area.  You'll
know you're in the right place if you see a telephone book recycling bin
on the left as you enter.  In fact, why don't you bring your old telephone
books for recycling while you're there? 

Suggestions for What to Bring:

* Food and Snacks
* Frisbees
* Kickballs, baseballs and baseball mitts
* Tennis Shoes
* Sunscreen Lotion
* Boomboxes and Mixtapes
* Blankets
* Shorts
* Cold Drinks

If you have any questions or would like a map snail-mailed to you, feel
free to e-mail me.  You may also reach my voice mail at: (216) 670-0380.

I hope to see all of you there!

Braden

	I went.  My first time at u4ia actually.  Unfortunately Josh
Wink had not one, but two flights out of Philly cancelled.  (it wuz
the night of the thunderstorms, and flights at Hopkins Airport
were bein' rerouted).  So that sucked.  On the plus side...somebody,
(I assume the owner of the club) was EXTREMELY apologetic, polite,
and very cool about the whole mishap.  Offering everyone A full
refund if they wanted to leave...or takin' $3 off the $8 admission
charge to stay...then he had Tic Tac, Rob Black and some other local
dj's come in.  He said that Josh Wink would be back in like 4 weeks...
and don't forget about Keoki next week...maybe we'll have better
luck?? :) So anyways, it sucked that he didn't show...but the club
did a great job of accomodating the whole situation. :)

you know...assuming that josh wink really got his flights cancelled...i
feel bad for these promoters that keoki is their next scheduled dj.  he has
a history of blowing off events, and if he does it's going to make these
promoters look like shit, 2 no-shows 2 weeks in a row...

take two of these and thank me in the morning,

Subject: {pb-cle} ascend
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

so, ascend happened saturday nite in springfield, ohio.  i was so excited
about this party...the kid doing it really seemed to have his heart in the
right place, i don't _think_ there ever ended up being a big full color
glossy flyer, just the pocket-sized black and white one.  good things.  he
had the space from fantastic voyage, at the clark county fairgrounds.  good
space with a happy medium of grungy old skool elements and clean new skool
elements.  he had a good, diverse dj lineup, as well as having a good-sized
jungle and hip hop room.  and was planning on $15 before 12 with a moon
bounce!!  and a chill room!!  well...

upon calling the voice mail we find out it's now 18 before 12.  not a big
deal.  get to the door and kevin brown is not on the lineup, neither is
traxx.  i ask the cat at the door about kevin brown.  he checks the list
and tells me he hasn't shown up yet but he's definitely coming and will
just spin later than planned (i showed up early cuz mark had told me kevin
brown would spin at 12).  anyway we go in and check things out.  ben/atman
is kicking ass in the main room but no-one is really there yet.  catch the
very end of sparkle's set in the jungle room.  after a mixer change (it
seemed like every single dj in the jungle/hip hop room used their own
mixer) some kid went on and spun hip hop.  it may have been RJ-D2.  he was
decent, but seemed a bit nervous for a while.  the only dj that really got
me grooving besides carlos.

i think i spent more time in the jungle/hip hop room, as the main room dj's
didn't really appeal to me, with the exception of carlos.  there was a
decent live PA, too bad that there were kids who were stupid enough to
think a mixtape was playing and decided to sit down *sigh*.  i don't know
who it was that was playing but he did some song that started with the
opening lines from the A-TEAM and it was badass.  after the entire sample
the bassline kicked in wicked and then it stopped again just for "soldiers
of fortune" before dropping back in.  UFO went on next.  MENTAL...jesus
kee-rist.  firstly he had some straight up science fiction mixer that
looked like it should be piloting a spacecraft of some sort.  before he
went on, he removed those screws under the platter that let you play to
+16.  and he was playing EVERYTHING at +16!!!  crazy dark techstep going a
million miles an hour.  i couldn't take a lot of it.  too much.  give me a
decent jump up set any day, this was too brutal for me.

otherwise, no-one was anything to write home about.  carlos was decent but
i was tired and very upset about something when he went on so i didn't
dance as much as i might have under different circumstances.

i have to say that the raver bullshit factor is WAAAY UP.  i'm sick of it.
it's too hard to ignore at this point.  even people that i love are just
fucking wack anymore.  maybe it's got a lot to do with my outlook on
things.  wait, it definitely does.  but that doesn't matter.  i hope to see
all the true headz at FA this weekend cuz it's my last big event until
metamorphosis, unless richie does something.  instead of wasting my time on
bullshit i'm gonna try to spend it bettering myself.  (that and getting
happy hardcore dj's to ohio, right ed? ;)  anyway, sorry if my mini-rant
bothers anyone.  if it does, you are either part of the problem (fuck you!)
or still optomistic and PLURRY which i really wish i could still be.  i was
a lot happier when i was a PLURRY blowpoppy stickery ecstacy-eating, no
responsibility having, lovey dovey touchy feely candyraver...

ugh.  i've become kinda rambly and bitchy.  i'm gonna shut up...for now.

take two of these and thank me in the morning,
michael

hrmm....

i'm new here, so just bear with me. please.

i'm trying hard not to be too "old" or "oldschool".  actually, my purpose 
for writing this is a little bit of self-examination and if any of you 
have any comments or discussions i would consider it a pleasure to engage 
them both publicly (here) and privately via email. (and if what you 
*really* think i need is a swift kick in the ass, email me and i'll give 
you my address)

but sometimes i feel a little bit of each.  i feel old when i look at my 
watch and it's two thirty or three and i think "oh my gosh! it's late!  
i should be in bed soon!" but really it's true.

and sometimes i go to clubz or eventz and see all these....well, you know 
what is there, but my perception of what i see is definitely affected by 
how old i am or the amount of time i've been "around" -- which is really 
just my own ego telling me i know something that the rest of the people 
in the bass-filled room don't, and that is a farce.

from what i can tell, this problem can be attacked from two angles:

first, what is it in my own mind that i use to decide that someone is 'in'
where i am or 'out' where i am not, and what input am i basing that on to
make this decision without talking to them.  and once i've figured that 
out i would like to do things that keep me from causing other people to 
judge me as 'out'--less for ego and more for the purpose of lubricating 
communication (which comes from the same root as 'community').

so what is it that i think i know that others don't?  
WhAT's tHE BiG SeKRIt?  i mean, i would hope that staying up late on so 
many occasions has taught me something i can really come away with.  
perhaps discovering this would provide me a mantra to share with people 
(in the hopes that anyone else really wanted to listen and hear anyway).

oh, and if you just don't give a fuck and want me to shut the hell up 
then email me and let me know that too....that will help me answer some 
of my questions.

back to the music,

What exactly is Time Bomb anyway?  Coffehouse, club, shop?  I don't get
out to Shadyside very often, but if there was somethin' special I'd
probably check it out.

Anyone check out Shenanigans?  Sounded like a good lineup...but alas had

Ya....well, when we were there, the manager said he'd be back in around
4 weeks....so hopefully like, 3 weeks from now? :) Mid-late July
sounds about right.

In a message dated 97-06-30 13:47:18 EDT, you write:

<< my purpose for writing this is a little bit of self-examination ...... so
what is it that i think i know that others don't? >> "referring to club or
rave scene"

Guess what, its nothing, there is nothing to learn from any "scene". The idea
is to have fun and meet interesting and exiting people, and most of all feel
good, not to learn anything in particular.  Life lessons come wherever you
are and whatever you are doing, its called aging...  If you want to learn,
and learn something worthwhile, get in school.....

o.k...there was one negative aspect to the party!!  there was about 2-3 
kegs of beer there!!  i don't like alcohol being served at parties...i 
think it brings in an unwanted negative vibe!!  but that's just my 
opinion!!!

ascend was basically complete bullshit. from the decent djs promised on
the flyer not showing up, to the price hike at the door, the total lack of
vibe and just the overall cookie-cutter candyass look & feel of the main
room.

me + colin & jenn showed up shortly after midnight and it felt like the
party hadn't even started yet. i just spend the first hour or so just
walking around talking to people, etc. i caught a bit of atman in the main
room who was great as usual, but i spent the entire night in the jungle
room.

the kid doing the jungle pa wasn't bad (i think his name was Set). the
A-Team track was pretty kickin, but for the most part it seemed like all
of his tracks were just simple basslines with a few breaks + samples. i
stuck around for most of his set, eagerly awaiting UFO.

UFO came out and fucking melted my brain. mad dark, fast and pounding
techstep straight to the dome. this guy ripped it up, one of the best
jungle sets i've ever heard. then again, i'm a techstep fanatic...his
sound wasn't for everyone.

Titonton then spun a dark dark dark techstep set with plenty of cut-up
styled mixing. kickass as usual.

Ground Zero was up next. this girl had some crazy skills! 3 turntable
action blending jump-up, hiphop and techstep. i think at times the sounds
became too muddled when she was laying down more complex tracks, but it
was dope as hell.

i can't agree with michael more on this. after stepping out of the jungle
room after several intense hours, i was greeted by one of the cheeziest
sights i have yet to behold. the dancefloor was just full of glow-stick
waving party kids floating along in la-la land, complete with over-the-top
fog, strobe lights, and lighting. it was lame. maybe it was after spending
all night in the jungle room, where everyone was totally into the tracks
and buildups, or maybe i am just starting to get fed up with generic
lame-ass 'raves'. i was just standing there, taking it in. carlos was
spinning a clubby and oh-so-danceable set of his typical material. i
have never liked carlos and everytime i have the unfortunate opportunity
to hear him spin i dislike him more and more. then some chick who looked
like she was up for the Ultimate CandyRaver Award(tm) started yelling at
me for not dancing. whatever. i danced my ass off in the jungle room, but
i'm sure the dark shit that UFO and Titonton was laying down was giving
all the kiddies 'bad vibes' or something.

i left the party in a pretty bad mood. the jungle room was kickass, but it
didn't make up for the shadiness and overall stereotypical "look ma, i'm a
raver!" attitudes of the attendees. there were tags all over the men's
bathroom by the time the night was over. everyone was also patted down for
weapons on the way in. it seemed like everyone there was either trying to
be a hard-ass crack-smoking muthafuckin G or a cute lil' candyraver
equiped with blowpop, stickers, glitter, glowsticks and enough PLUR to
save the world. yeah i'm being negative, but i can't remember a time
recently when i've been more annoyed and bothered.  if your not there for
the music, then stay home and listen to your MTV Party To Go cd
collection.

Hi all,
  Sorry for the monstrous distribution but were starting to get a little
antsy about this weekend. Basically I and Joe need a ride to Family Affair
III outside of Akron Ohio. Joe(1.8.7) was just booked to do Friday night
as well as Saturday night so he needs a ride for him and his gear (A
keyboard and some effects units) from Pittsburgh on Friday. I on the
otherhand will probably not be able to leave Philly (due to circumstances
at work) until Saturday. If anyone can help either or both of us please
write back ASAP.  Of course we can provide gas money, treats, stuff to
listen to etc. Thank you in advance. 


Steph & Joe

In a message dated 97-06-30 22:25:41 EDT, you write:

<<  if your not there for
 the music, then stay home and listen to your MTV Party To Go cd
 collection.
  >>

If your not there to accept not reject, then stay in the Jungle room, or
better yet, your car.  Im pretty sure thats why they keep you guys in a
separate room.  I do believe  the party was lame though.  18 bills can jump
in the lake.

AHEM
What exactly do you mean by "that's why they keep you guys in a separate
room?"

he's got the right to complain about what he feels, but your comment is
quite off base..

********************************************************************************I might of misread the above comment....but, "...they keep
*you guys* in a seperate room"??? Implying all those who
like jungle are what?  Hopefully I just misunderstood. :)
