             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Jul 11              SOMMEIL - A CONCERT FOR SLEEP             Cleveland

Tanner Menard's reinterpretation of the sleep concert experiment, first 
created by Robert Rich in 1982. Jeremy Bible and Jason Henry will remix 
sleep music collected from nearly 100 artists from around the world 
while Chika weaves an ambient light experience using modul8 VJ software. 
The concert will be realized with Rich.s permission and guidance and 
conceptually and sonically remixed by Tanner Menard. Sleep concerts are 
all-night events in which the audience is asked to attend the concert 
with a sleeping bag and pillow and to fall asleep while a slowly 
unfolding sonic and visual texture evolves over the course of the night 
and into the morning. People attending the event are asked to be willing 
to sleep during the event or at least to remain silent during the course 
of the nine hour experience. Sommeil is a conceptual, global 
reinterpretation of a performance type that addresses one of the most 
basic functionalities of ambient and environmental sound and video; 
media by which to sleep. You can follow the artistic process of the 
Sommeil experiment by reading Tanner Menard's blog

Sat Jul 18                         HORIZON                       Pittsburgh

We are bringing some people out of the woodwork for this little baby. 
We've got a little bit of everything to hopefully please every single 
one of you! All these performers will have you dancing from the moment 
the sun disappears until the break of dawn.

Walkingstick - Jungle/reggae jungle/hip-hop [San Fransisco, CA] Five 
years after leaving the 'Burgh for San Francisco... After hundreds of 
thousands of air miles logged... Walkingstick makes his return!

>From 1998 to about 2005 Walkingstick was a very common name to see on a 
flyer in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland region. He was known for his oldskool, 
sample heavy, jungle style, often mixing in hip hop or various tracks 
from around the globe, anything to make it fun for the audience. He was 
also one of the founders of Total Xperience Productions, known for 
throwing memorable events such as NO DOZE, HUMBLE, ICEBURGH, GIFTED, 
HOMEGROWN and many more.

Throughout the years, Walkingstick not only played all throughout the 
USA but has also made numerous tours to Brazil, played shows in Puerto 
Rico, Scotland, etc..

After moving to San Francisco, Walkingstick has lead a much more low-key 
lifestyle, trading the flashing hypnotic lights of clubs and raves for 
staying home and producing his own tracks. Walkingstick has released one 
vinyl record every year for the past 5 years, one release on Jungle 
Riddim Records and four on his own label, Walkingstick World Records. 
All releases on his label have featured various artists and genres from 
around the globe, including artists from Russia, Switzerland and the 
most well-known name in baile funk, Mr. Catra, from Brazil.

So, after 5 years, Walkingstick comes to the 'Burgh, like straight out 
of a time machine to make a very rare performance featuring loads of 
Walkingstick original dubplates and other sounds you've never heard but 
also some classics that will surely keep you moving! Get ready for some 
junglist, dubplate business!!!
WA-WA-WA-WA-WALKINGSTICK!!!!!!!!

Ben Matrix - Drum and Bass
[Miami, FL]
He is making his return to Pittsburgh all the way from Miami to deliver 
a drum and bass set you are not soon to forget!!

Marty Mcfly - The funkiest breaks you've ever heard [Toronto, Canada] A 
long time ago... In a Delorean far far away.. MartyMcFly started mixing 
breakbeats. He got his start back in 1992 in Western Canada before 
cruisin' over to Toronto in 1995. He.s been mixing da Breaks across 
North America  ever since. His last visit to Pittsburgh was back in 
2007. Marty.s a huge breaker at heart and total mixologist behind the 
decks. His love and enthusiasm for music makes for a shit load of fun 
out on the dance floor.. Calling out all fun funky breakers for this 
one!!!

Venom - Hardcore/ass shaking booty house/hard house [Rumford, RI] Here 
he is, making his annual visit to the burgh. His award winning 
scratching and floorfilling track selection has made him a fan favorite. 
He has produced and released a countless number of tracks and complete 
mixes. So here comes the teacher to school you with some booty shaking 
sounds!!

DJ Meghan - Psytrance/downtempo
[Cleveland]
Considered one of the regions best psytrance and downtempo DJs, Meghan's 
DJ sets always deliver. Every beat will take you to distant places, 
making you feel exquisitely good. Don't miss out on this leading 
psytrance lady!!

Shawn Rudiman (Live) - Sexy Techno
[Pittsburgh]
This is a man who needs little introduction. He is truely a consummate 
artist, he prefers to play without the use of computers or software.
he chooses to conduct his sets like a jazz band would: letting every 
machine flow like performers and have their particular freedoms and 
moment to shine.  over 90% of all composition are composed there on the 
spot, for him and the audience to experience together for the first 
time.

Joltz - Hardcore/hardcore breaks/scratching [Pittsburgh] This guy might 
just be Pittsburgh's best kept hardcore secret!! Come check him out so 
he can blow you away.

DJ Kip Collins - Progressive/Trance
Pittsburgh

In addition to the lineup we have some special plans for the production 
including intense lights and lasers, mindboggling visuals, unique decor, 
cryogenic effects to keep the dancefloor frosty even on the hottest of 
summer nights and of course massive soundsystems that will let you feel 
every beat.

All Ages so everyone can enjoy this special night!!

DEEKLINE // LONDON // UNITED KINGDOM

RAT RECORDS // HOT CAKES // BOOTY BREAKS

CUT & RUN // SLUDGE // HARDCORE BEATS


www.myspace.com/djdeekline


Deekline; DJ, producer, mega hot remixer and founder of Rat Records, 
Hardcore Beats, Cut & Run, Hot Cakes, Booty Breaks, and Sludge, has come 
along way since his smash hit "Don't Smoke The Reefer" back in 1998. 
With 15 tours of the US and North America, 4 tours of Australia and 2 
tours of New Zealand, you may have caught him in the past 10 years 
playing in some major city from Chicago to London, or Sydney to Spain. 
His unique and ground breaking sound blows up parties the world over, 
sending shockwaves through the industry leaving others inspired and 
following in his footsteps.

As a youngster, Deekline (aka Nick Annand) started collecting records 
inspired by funk and electro, before becoming interested in hardcore and 
jungle; which led to him being at the forefront of breakbeat culture 
from its birth. He has become an iconic name within the breakbeat, Miami 
bass and dance scene, creating his own unique sound of breakbeat with an 
electro twist.

Deekline.s collaboration with partner Wizard, has led to the duo being 
recognised more prominently as one of breakbeat.s most uber-production 
partnerships. Their new album .Back Off. (Supercharged) has earned rave 
reviews and new single .Angels. has seen remixes from MJ Cole & NAPT 
whilst .Back Off. named after the album has been playlisted on Annie 
Nightingale.s Radio 1 show.

Deekline.s official remix with FreQ Nasty of Old Dirty Bastards "Every 
Posse & Crew" rocketed into the dance charts in the UK, whilst his "Got 
Your Money" remix earned him maximum kudos in the breaks, garage, Miami 
bass and 2-step scenes. Other major remixes include Armand Van Helden 
.My My My. (Deekline & Wizard) which Zane Lowe made his record of the 
week on his Radio1 show, The Prodigy.s .Outta Space., Freestylers .Boom 
Blast., new single .Whats Up. with Tittsworth feat Kid Sister and Fort 
Know Five.s .Funk For Peace..

His single with Ed Solo and Darrison .Touch Your Toes. was signed to 
Norman Cook.s .Skint. label and went on to full release in the summer of 
2006. In his 12-year career Deekline has also been signed to Warner, 
Super Star, Southern Fried Records, Supercharged, Botchit & Scarper, and 
Against The Grain and his own Rat Records label, now has in excess of 50 
releases. Rat Records is a huge part of the breakbeat scene for its 
attention to high quality releases, and pioneering DJs and Producers 
such as JFB, Crissy Chris (Radio1) and Ed Solo.

Deekline himself has worked and continues to work with heavyweight 
producers such as Tim Healey, Wizard, Ed Solo, DJ Assault, DJ Fresh, 
Stanton Warriors, Arthur Baker, Freestylers, and Fort Knox Five, not to 
mention vocalists Ivory, Yolanda, Wiley, and TopCat. 2008 saw him 
produce singles for Ivory, Shystie, and Slyde Beats.

2009 brings new production and remixes for Shystie .New Style. and 
.Don.t Let Go. Yo Majesty. This year is set to be a phenomenal year for 
DJ Deekline, his partner Wizard and all other collaborators that work 
with him.

This year expect to see Deekline taking centre stage at WMC (America) 
Shambala (Canada), Burning Man (Nevada), and Glastonbury (UK) to name 
but a few. Where he.ll continue to make booty.s bounce and the girls 
wiggle.


KEITH MACKENZIE // Chicago

www.myspace.com/illeveneleven

GUESTLIST, #1 ON BEATPORT BREAKS

Originally from Tampa, FL, Chicago resident Keith MacKenzie has been at 
the forefront of all things breakbeat for well over a decade as part of 
DJ Icey's mighty Zone Records label. After multiple releases and high 
profile collaborations with the likes of Icey, Infiniti and DJ Fixx (as 
KMFX) on established US labels like Zone, Afterdark and Bottom-End 
Records, Keith created his own imprint, Illeven:Eleven. Now 10 releases 
deep, the label continues to function as a conduit of sorts, melding and 
combining fresh sounds by up and coming and established US talent with 
their overseas counterparts in an attempt to smash breakbeat genre 
conventions. For the past 8 years, Keith has also kept an energetic 
touring calendar, playing upfront DJ sets to very receptive crowds 
across the US and internationally. The Booty Breaks sound has been 
conceived from the ground up as a reflection of the ever changing 
palette of the average dance music lover. Taking it's cues from current 
short attention span-addled dancefloor trends, it incorporates elements 
from disparate genres like house, hip hop/booty bass, mainstream pop, 
and rock within the existing breakbeat framework. The result is a 
road-tested, hyperkinetic blend of beats, sure to pique the interest of 
hardcore fans and casual listeners alike.


DJ MARK YURM // Atlanta, GA // breaks

Household Management //
www.householdatlanta.com
www.myspace.com/markyurm
www.oneloveskateshop.com

DJ Mark Yurm is the alter ego of Brandon Couturier, and is primarily a 
breakbeat DJ from Atlanta, GA. He has been rocking dance floors since 
1994. He is one of the most well rounded DJ.s to ever come out of 
Atlanta, mixing anything from House Music, to Drum N Bass (as The 
Rainmaker), and everything in between. He specializes in broken beats 
including Breaks & 2 Step, although he has been know to drop sick 
Electro set now and then as well. With such an arsenal of styles it is 
no wonder why when Mark Yurm is on the decks, there is definitely a 
party going on. Mark has played along such legendary acts as DJ Magic 
Mike, Rennie Pilgrem, Adam F, Hive, DB, Sharaz, Fiction and Spice, 
Donald Glaude, Terry Mullan, Phantom 45, Deekline, Rick West, Capital J, 
Huda Hudia, DJ Funk, Dave Christophere, and many many more. His blend of 
mixing in and out of broken beats with 4/4 runners can only be simply 
described as fun. His sets are sure to make the heart pump, and the feet 
move, in ways that you would have never expected. Now embarking into his 
fifteenth year of being a DJ, Mr.Yurm looks to progress the sounds that 
have taken care of him even further. In 2009, Mark Yurm has re-joined 
forces with long time manager, and best friend, MJ, to re-launch 
Household Atlanta, a company which includes Artist Management, and large 
scale Event Showcases, as well as a soon to be launched record label. 
Mark will not only handle new artist acquisitions and information for 
Household Management, he will also be starting to tour again this year. 
Excitement is the word coming out of Atlanta, as Household, and Mark 
Yurm, look to be one of the next driving forces of dance music for years 
to come on a global basis.

Ferry Corsten, the Crystal Method, Dirty Vegas, Darude, Bad Boy Bill, 
Steve Porter, and dj Rap. The list goes on and on. Tonys unique blend of 
tech house ranges full spectrum, from techno to funky. Full of amazing

STUART ALLEN VS ADAM S
dayton // guab // breakbeat

www.myspace.com/stuartallen138
www.myspace.com/schrimpin

Hailing from the renown Midwest Breakbeat Camp, Give Us A Break! founder 
Stuart Allen and pioneer Adam S have been making a name for themselves 
across the midwest. playing one-off raves and club gigs every other 
weekend across the tri-State area. These two drop banger after banger in 
every set they play. impeccable track selection combined with a keen ear 
for new and rowdy mixes make this breakbeat duo a Midwest favorite. 
Stuart Allen started buying records in 1996. His love of music and his 
desire for official breakbeat representation in Dayton Ohio led him to 
establish Give Us A Break! in 2003. This is where he met up his partner 
Adam S, and the two have been playing shows together ever since. Since 
then everything form their label, their roster, their events, and their 
city, have been gaining national attention by leaps and bounds.


VACATE
Drum and Bass // Dubstep - Columbus, OH

Wreck and Rep /// Shift Recordings /// Dirty Circuit

www.myspace.com/coreyvacate

Vacate, the founder of Wreck and Rep, is a rising force in the stateside 
Drum & Bass and Dubstep movement. With releases on Shift Recordings, 
like the bass killing, light bulb busting "Body Flip" and on Dirty 
Circuit Records with the raw, bar brawl worthy "Vibe Crusha" no sound 
system is safe. His remix of AC Slater's "Hello" is starting to rip 
through the dance floors' with its menacing wobble bass. Between killing 
shows with his insanely, high energized, quick mixed sets and his tracks 
being played worldwide, there is no question that this midwest talent is 
no longer laying back in the shadows.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Jul 11              SOMMEIL - A CONCERT FOR SLEEP             Cleveland

Tanner Menard's reinterpretation of the sleep concert experiment, first 
created by Robert Rich in 1982. Jeremy Bible and Jason Henry will remix 
sleep music collected from nearly 100 artists from around the world 
while Chika weaves an ambient light experience using modul8 VJ software. 
The concert will be realized with Rich.s permission and guidance and 
conceptually and sonically remixed by Tanner Menard. Sleep concerts are 
all-night events in which the audience is asked to attend the concert 
with a sleeping bag and pillow and to fall asleep while a slowly 
unfolding sonic and visual texture evolves over the course of the night 
and into the morning. People attending the event are asked to be willing 
to sleep during the event or at least to remain silent during the course 
of the nine hour experience. Sommeil is a conceptual, global 
reinterpretation of a performance type that addresses one of the most 
basic functionalities of ambient and environmental sound and video; 
media by which to sleep. You can follow the artistic process of the 
Sommeil experiment by reading Tanner Menard's blog

Sat Jul 18                         HORIZON                       Pittsburgh

We are bringing some people out of the woodwork for this little baby. 
We've got a little bit of everything to hopefully please every single 
one of you! All these performers will have you dancing from the moment 
the sun disappears until the break of dawn.

Walkingstick - Jungle/reggae jungle/hip-hop [San Fransisco, CA] Five 
years after leaving the 'Burgh for San Francisco... After hundreds of 
thousands of air miles logged... Walkingstick makes his return!

>From 1998 to about 2005 Walkingstick was a very common name to see on a 
flyer in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland region. He was known for his oldskool, 
sample heavy, jungle style, often mixing in hip hop or various tracks 
from around the globe, anything to make it fun for the audience. He was 
also one of the founders of Total Xperience Productions, known for 
throwing memorable events such as NO DOZE, HUMBLE, ICEBURGH, GIFTED, 
HOMEGROWN and many more.

Throughout the years, Walkingstick not only played all throughout the 
USA but has also made numerous tours to Brazil, played shows in Puerto 
Rico, Scotland, etc..

After moving to San Francisco, Walkingstick has lead a much more low-key 
lifestyle, trading the flashing hypnotic lights of clubs and raves for 
staying home and producing his own tracks. Walkingstick has released one 
vinyl record every year for the past 5 years, one release on Jungle 
Riddim Records and four on his own label, Walkingstick World Records. 
All releases on his label have featured various artists and genres from 
around the globe, including artists from Russia, Switzerland and the 
most well-known name in baile funk, Mr. Catra, from Brazil.

So, after 5 years, Walkingstick comes to the 'Burgh, like straight out 
of a time machine to make a very rare performance featuring loads of 
Walkingstick original dubplates and other sounds you've never heard but 
also some classics that will surely keep you moving! Get ready for some 
junglist, dubplate business!!!
WA-WA-WA-WA-WALKINGSTICK!!!!!!!!

Ben Matrix - Drum and Bass
[Miami, FL]
He is making his return to Pittsburgh all the way from Miami to deliver 
a drum and bass set you are not soon to forget!!

Marty Mcfly - The funkiest breaks you've ever heard [Toronto, Canada] A 
long time ago... In a Delorean far far away.. MartyMcFly started mixing 
breakbeats. He got his start back in 1992 in Western Canada before 
cruisin' over to Toronto in 1995. He.s been mixing da Breaks across 
North America  ever since. His last visit to Pittsburgh was back in 
2007. Marty.s a huge breaker at heart and total mixologist behind the 
decks. His love and enthusiasm for music makes for a shit load of fun 
out on the dance floor.. Calling out all fun funky breakers for this 
one!!!

Venom - Hardcore/ass shaking booty house/hard house [Rumford, RI] Here 
he is, making his annual visit to the burgh. His award winning 
scratching and floorfilling track selection has made him a fan favorite. 
He has produced and released a countless number of tracks and complete 
mixes. So here comes the teacher to school you with some booty shaking 
sounds!!

DJ Meghan - Psytrance/downtempo
[Cleveland]
Considered one of the regions best psytrance and downtempo DJs, Meghan's 
DJ sets always deliver. Every beat will take you to distant places, 
making you feel exquisitely good. Don't miss out on this leading 
psytrance lady!!

Shawn Rudiman (Live) - Sexy Techno
[Pittsburgh]
This is a man who needs little introduction. He is truely a consummate 
artist, he prefers to play without the use of computers or software.
he chooses to conduct his sets like a jazz band would: letting every 
machine flow like performers and have their particular freedoms and 
moment to shine.  over 90% of all composition are composed there on the 
spot, for him and the audience to experience together for the first 
time.

Joltz - Hardcore/hardcore breaks/scratching [Pittsburgh] This guy might 
just be Pittsburgh's best kept hardcore secret!! Come check him out so 
he can blow you away.

DJ Kip Collins - Progressive/Trance
Pittsburgh

In addition to the lineup we have some special plans for the production 
including intense lights and lasers, mindboggling visuals, unique decor, 
cryogenic effects to keep the dancefloor frosty even on the hottest of 
summer nights and of course massive soundsystems that will let you feel 
every beat.

All Ages so everyone can enjoy this special night!!

DEEKLINE // LONDON // UNITED KINGDOM

RAT RECORDS // HOT CAKES // BOOTY BREAKS

CUT & RUN // SLUDGE // HARDCORE BEATS


www.myspace.com/djdeekline


Deekline; DJ, producer, mega hot remixer and founder of Rat Records, 
Hardcore Beats, Cut & Run, Hot Cakes, Booty Breaks, and Sludge, has come 
along way since his smash hit "Don't Smoke The Reefer" back in 1998. 
With 15 tours of the US and North America, 4 tours of Australia and 2 
tours of New Zealand, you may have caught him in the past 10 years 
playing in some major city from Chicago to London, or Sydney to Spain. 
His unique and ground breaking sound blows up parties the world over, 
sending shockwaves through the industry leaving others inspired and 
following in his footsteps.

As a youngster, Deekline (aka Nick Annand) started collecting records 
inspired by funk and electro, before becoming interested in hardcore and 
jungle; which led to him being at the forefront of breakbeat culture 
from its birth. He has become an iconic name within the breakbeat, Miami 
bass and dance scene, creating his own unique sound of breakbeat with an 
electro twist.

Deekline.s collaboration with partner Wizard, has led to the duo being 
recognised more prominently as one of breakbeat.s most uber-production 
partnerships. Their new album .Back Off. (Supercharged) has earned rave 
reviews and new single .Angels. has seen remixes from MJ Cole & NAPT 
whilst .Back Off. named after the album has been playlisted on Annie 
Nightingale.s Radio 1 show.

Deekline.s official remix with FreQ Nasty of Old Dirty Bastards "Every 
Posse & Crew" rocketed into the dance charts in the UK, whilst his "Got 
Your Money" remix earned him maximum kudos in the breaks, garage, Miami 
bass and 2-step scenes. Other major remixes include Armand Van Helden 
.My My My. (Deekline & Wizard) which Zane Lowe made his record of the 
week on his Radio1 show, The Prodigy.s .Outta Space., Freestylers .Boom 
Blast., new single .Whats Up. with Tittsworth feat Kid Sister and Fort 
Know Five.s .Funk For Peace..

His single with Ed Solo and Darrison .Touch Your Toes. was signed to 
Norman Cook.s .Skint. label and went on to full release in the summer of 
2006. In his 12-year career Deekline has also been signed to Warner, 
Super Star, Southern Fried Records, Supercharged, Botchit & Scarper, and 
Against The Grain and his own Rat Records label, now has in excess of 50 
releases. Rat Records is a huge part of the breakbeat scene for its 
attention to high quality releases, and pioneering DJs and Producers 
such as JFB, Crissy Chris (Radio1) and Ed Solo.

Deekline himself has worked and continues to work with heavyweight 
producers such as Tim Healey, Wizard, Ed Solo, DJ Assault, DJ Fresh, 
Stanton Warriors, Arthur Baker, Freestylers, and Fort Knox Five, not to 
mention vocalists Ivory, Yolanda, Wiley, and TopCat. 2008 saw him 
produce singles for Ivory, Shystie, and Slyde Beats.

2009 brings new production and remixes for Shystie .New Style. and 
.Don.t Let Go. Yo Majesty. This year is set to be a phenomenal year for 
DJ Deekline, his partner Wizard and all other collaborators that work 
with him.

This year expect to see Deekline taking centre stage at WMC (America) 
Shambala (Canada), Burning Man (Nevada), and Glastonbury (UK) to name 
but a few. Where he.ll continue to make booty.s bounce and the girls 
wiggle.


KEITH MACKENZIE // Chicago

www.myspace.com/illeveneleven

GUESTLIST, #1 ON BEATPORT BREAKS

Originally from Tampa, FL, Chicago resident Keith MacKenzie has been at 
the forefront of all things breakbeat for well over a decade as part of 
DJ Icey's mighty Zone Records label. After multiple releases and high 
profile collaborations with the likes of Icey, Infiniti and DJ Fixx (as 
KMFX) on established US labels like Zone, Afterdark and Bottom-End 
Records, Keith created his own imprint, Illeven:Eleven. Now 10 releases 
deep, the label continues to function as a conduit of sorts, melding and 
combining fresh sounds by up and coming and established US talent with 
their overseas counterparts in an attempt to smash breakbeat genre 
conventions. For the past 8 years, Keith has also kept an energetic 
touring calendar, playing upfront DJ sets to very receptive crowds 
across the US and internationally. The Booty Breaks sound has been 
conceived from the ground up as a reflection of the ever changing 
palette of the average dance music lover. Taking it's cues from current 
short attention span-addled dancefloor trends, it incorporates elements 
from disparate genres like house, hip hop/booty bass, mainstream pop, 
and rock within the existing breakbeat framework. The result is a 
road-tested, hyperkinetic blend of beats, sure to pique the interest of 
hardcore fans and casual listeners alike.


DJ MARK YURM // Atlanta, GA // breaks

Household Management //
www.householdatlanta.com
www.myspace.com/markyurm
www.oneloveskateshop.com

DJ Mark Yurm is the alter ego of Brandon Couturier, and is primarily a 
breakbeat DJ from Atlanta, GA. He has been rocking dance floors since 
1994. He is one of the most well rounded DJ.s to ever come out of 
Atlanta, mixing anything from House Music, to Drum N Bass (as The 
Rainmaker), and everything in between. He specializes in broken beats 
including Breaks & 2 Step, although he has been know to drop sick 
Electro set now and then as well. With such an arsenal of styles it is 
no wonder why when Mark Yurm is on the decks, there is definitely a 
party going on. Mark has played along such legendary acts as DJ Magic 
Mike, Rennie Pilgrem, Adam F, Hive, DB, Sharaz, Fiction and Spice, 
Donald Glaude, Terry Mullan, Phantom 45, Deekline, Rick West, Capital J, 
Huda Hudia, DJ Funk, Dave Christophere, and many many more. His blend of 
mixing in and out of broken beats with 4/4 runners can only be simply 
described as fun. His sets are sure to make the heart pump, and the feet 
move, in ways that you would have never expected. Now embarking into his 
fifteenth year of being a DJ, Mr.Yurm looks to progress the sounds that 
have taken care of him even further. In 2009, Mark Yurm has re-joined 
forces with long time manager, and best friend, MJ, to re-launch 
Household Atlanta, a company which includes Artist Management, and large 
scale Event Showcases, as well as a soon to be launched record label. 
Mark will not only handle new artist acquisitions and information for 
Household Management, he will also be starting to tour again this year. 
Excitement is the word coming out of Atlanta, as Household, and Mark 
Yurm, look to be one of the next driving forces of dance music for years 
to come on a global basis.

commanding dance floors for the past 17 years. Not many djs can claim 
that they have opened for Sasha and Digweed, Paul Van Dyk, BT, Deadmau5, 
Ferry Corsten, the Crystal Method, Dirty Vegas, Darude, Bad Boy Bill, 
Steve Porter, and dj Rap. The list goes on and on. Tonys unique blend of 
tech house ranges full spectrum, from techno to funky. Full of amazing 
crescendos, his legendary sets have gained notoriety over the years. If 
you heard his set on nye or at SIKE! you'll know what to expect!!


STUART ALLEN VS ADAM S
dayton // guab // breakbeat

www.myspace.com/stuartallen138
www.myspace.com/schrimpin

Hailing from the renown Midwest Breakbeat Camp, Give Us A Break! founder 
Stuart Allen and pioneer Adam S have been making a name for themselves 
across the midwest. playing one-off raves and club gigs every other 
weekend across the tri-State area. These two drop banger after banger in 
every set they play. impeccable track selection combined with a keen ear 
for new and rowdy mixes make this breakbeat duo a Midwest favorite. 
Stuart Allen started buying records in 1996. His love of music and his 
desire for official breakbeat representation in Dayton Ohio led him to 
establish Give Us A Break! in 2003. This is where he met up his partner 
Adam S, and the two have been playing shows together ever since. Since 
then everything form their label, their roster, their events, and their 
city, have been gaining national attention by leaps and bounds.


VACATE
Drum and Bass // Dubstep - Columbus, OH

Wreck and Rep /// Shift Recordings /// Dirty Circuit

www.myspace.com/coreyvacate

Vacate, the founder of Wreck and Rep, is a rising force in the stateside 
Drum & Bass and Dubstep movement. With releases on Shift Recordings, 
like the bass killing, light bulb busting "Body Flip" and on Dirty 
Circuit Records with the raw, bar brawl worthy "Vibe Crusha" no sound 
system is safe. His remix of AC Slater's "Hello" is starting to rip 
through the dance floors' with its menacing wobble bass. Between killing 
shows with his insanely, high energized, quick mixed sets and his tracks 
being played worldwide, there is no question that this midwest talent is 
no longer laying back in the shadows.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

10:15-11:30 Marty Mcfly
11:30-1 Venom
1-2:30 Walkingstick
2:30-4:00 Shawn Rudiman
4:00-5 Ben Matrix

We are bringing some people out of the woodwork for this little baby. 
We've got a little bit of everything to hopefully please every single 
one of you! All these performers will have you dancing from the moment 
the sun disappears until the break of dawn.

Walkingstick - Jungle/reggae jungle/hip-hop [San Fransisco, CA] Five 
years after leaving the 'Burgh for San Francisco... After hundreds of 
thousands of air miles logged... Walkingstick makes his return!

>From 1998 to about 2005 Walkingstick was a very common name to see on a 
flyer in the Pittsburgh/Cleveland region. He was known for his oldskool, 
sample heavy, jungle style, often mixing in hip hop or various tracks 
from around the globe, anything to make it fun for the audience. He was 
also one of the founders of Total Xperience Productions, known for 
throwing memorable events such as NO DOZE, HUMBLE, ICEBURGH, GIFTED, 
HOMEGROWN and many more.

Throughout the years, Walkingstick not only played all throughout the 
USA but has also made numerous tours to Brazil, played shows in Puerto 
Rico, Scotland, etc..

After moving to San Francisco, Walkingstick has lead a much more low-key 
lifestyle, trading the flashing hypnotic lights of clubs and raves for 
staying home and producing his own tracks. Walkingstick has released one 
vinyl record every year for the past 5 years, one release on Jungle 
Riddim Records and four on his own label, Walkingstick World Records. 
All releases on his label have featured various artists and genres from 
around the globe, including artists from Russia, Switzerland and the 
most well-known name in baile funk, Mr. Catra, from Brazil.

So, after 5 years, Walkingstick comes to the 'Burgh, like straight out 
of a time machine to make a very rare performance featuring loads of 
Walkingstick original dubplates and other sounds you've never heard but 
also some classics that will surely keep you moving! Get ready for some 
junglist, dubplate business!!!
WA-WA-WA-WA-WALKINGSTICK!!!!!!!!

Ben Matrix - Drum and Bass
[Miami, FL]
He is making his return to Pittsburgh all the way from Miami to deliver 
a drum and bass set you are not soon to forget!!

Marty Mcfly - The funkiest breaks you've ever heard [Toronto, Canada] A 
long time ago... In a Delorean far far away.. MartyMcFly started mixing 
breakbeats. He got his start back in 1992 in Western Canada before 
cruisin' over to Toronto in 1995. He.s been mixing da Breaks across 
North America  ever since. His last visit to Pittsburgh was back in 
2007. Marty.s a huge breaker at heart and total mixologist behind the 
decks. His love and enthusiasm for music makes for a shit load of fun 
out on the dance floor.. Calling out all fun funky breakers for this 
one!!!

Venom - Hardcore/ass shaking booty house/hard house [Rumford, RI] Here 
he is, making his annual visit to the burgh. His award winning 
scratching and floorfilling track selection has made him a fan favorite. 
He has produced and released a countless number of tracks and complete 
mixes. So here comes the teacher to school you with some booty shaking 
sounds!!

DJ Meghan - Psytrance/downtempo
[Cleveland]
Considered one of the regions best psytrance and downtempo DJs, Meghan's 
DJ sets always deliver. Every beat will take you to distant places, 
making you feel exquisitely good. Don't miss out on this leading 
psytrance lady!!

Shawn Rudiman (Live) - Sexy Techno
[Pittsburgh]
This is a man who needs little introduction. He is truely a consummate 
artist, he prefers to play without the use of computers or software.
he chooses to conduct his sets like a jazz band would: letting every 
machine flow like performers and have their particular freedoms and 
moment to shine.  over 90% of all composition are composed there on the 
spot, for him and the audience to experience together for the first 
time.

Joltz - Hardcore/hardcore breaks/scratching [Pittsburgh] This guy might 
just be Pittsburgh's best kept hardcore secret!! Come check him out so 
he can blow you away.

DJ Kip Collins - Progressive/Trance
Pittsburgh

In addition to the lineup we have some special plans for the production 
including intense lights and lasers, mindboggling visuals, unique decor, 
cryogenic effects to keep the dancefloor frosty even on the hottest of 
summer nights and of course massive soundsystems that will let you feel

DEEKLINE // LONDON // UNITED KINGDOM

RAT RECORDS // HOT CAKES // BOOTY BREAKS

CUT & RUN // SLUDGE // HARDCORE BEATS


www.myspace.com/djdeekline


Deekline; DJ, producer, mega hot remixer and founder of Rat Records, 
Hardcore Beats, Cut & Run, Hot Cakes, Booty Breaks, and Sludge, has come 
along way since his smash hit "Don't Smoke The Reefer" back in 1998. 
With 15 tours of the US and North America, 4 tours of Australia and 2 
tours of New Zealand, you may have caught him in the past 10 years 
playing in some major city from Chicago to London, or Sydney to Spain. 
His unique and ground breaking sound blows up parties the world over, 
sending shockwaves through the industry leaving others inspired and 
following in his footsteps.

As a youngster, Deekline (aka Nick Annand) started collecting records 
inspired by funk and electro, before becoming interested in hardcore and 
jungle; which led to him being at the forefront of breakbeat culture 
from its birth. He has become an iconic name within the breakbeat, Miami 
bass and dance scene, creating his own unique sound of breakbeat with an 
electro twist.

Deekline.s collaboration with partner Wizard, has led to the duo being 
recognised more prominently as one of breakbeat.s most uber-production 
partnerships. Their new album .Back Off. (Supercharged) has earned rave 
reviews and new single .Angels. has seen remixes from MJ Cole & NAPT 
whilst .Back Off. named after the album has been playlisted on Annie 
Nightingale.s Radio 1 show.

Deekline.s official remix with FreQ Nasty of Old Dirty Bastards "Every 
Posse & Crew" rocketed into the dance charts in the UK, whilst his "Got 
Your Money" remix earned him maximum kudos in the breaks, garage, Miami 
bass and 2-step scenes. Other major remixes include Armand Van Helden 
.My My My. (Deekline & Wizard) which Zane Lowe made his record of the 
week on his Radio1 show, The Prodigy.s .Outta Space., Freestylers .Boom 
Blast., new single .Whats Up. with Tittsworth feat Kid Sister and Fort 
Know Five.s .Funk For Peace..

His single with Ed Solo and Darrison .Touch Your Toes. was signed to 
Norman Cook.s .Skint. label and went on to full release in the summer of 
2006. In his 12-year career Deekline has also been signed to Warner, 
Super Star, Southern Fried Records, Supercharged, Botchit & Scarper, and 
Against The Grain and his own Rat Records label, now has in excess of 50 
releases. Rat Records is a huge part of the breakbeat scene for its 
attention to high quality releases, and pioneering DJs and Producers 
such as JFB, Crissy Chris (Radio1) and Ed Solo.

Deekline himself has worked and continues to work with heavyweight 
producers such as Tim Healey, Wizard, Ed Solo, DJ Assault, DJ Fresh, 
Stanton Warriors, Arthur Baker, Freestylers, and Fort Knox Five, not to 
mention vocalists Ivory, Yolanda, Wiley, and TopCat. 2008 saw him 
produce singles for Ivory, Shystie, and Slyde Beats.

2009 brings new production and remixes for Shystie .New Style. and 
.Don.t Let Go. Yo Majesty. This year is set to be a phenomenal year for 
DJ Deekline, his partner Wizard and all other collaborators that work 
with him.

This year expect to see Deekline taking centre stage at WMC (America) 
Shambala (Canada), Burning Man (Nevada), and Glastonbury (UK) to name 
but a few. Where he.ll continue to make booty.s bounce and the girls 
wiggle.


KEITH MACKENZIE // Chicago

www.myspace.com/illeveneleven

GUESTLIST, #1 ON BEATPORT BREAKS

Originally from Tampa, FL, Chicago resident Keith MacKenzie has been at 
the forefront of all things breakbeat for well over a decade as part of 
DJ Icey's mighty Zone Records label. After multiple releases and high 
profile collaborations with the likes of Icey, Infiniti and DJ Fixx (as 
KMFX) on established US labels like Zone, Afterdark and Bottom-End 
Records, Keith created his own imprint, Illeven:Eleven. Now 10 releases 
deep, the label continues to function as a conduit of sorts, melding and 
combining fresh sounds by up and coming and established US talent with 
their overseas counterparts in an attempt to smash breakbeat genre 
conventions. For the past 8 years, Keith has also kept an energetic 
touring calendar, playing upfront DJ sets to very receptive crowds 
across the US and internationally. The Booty Breaks sound has been 
conceived from the ground up as a reflection of the ever changing 
palette of the average dance music lover. Taking it's cues from current 
short attention span-addled dancefloor trends, it incorporates elements 
from disparate genres like house, hip hop/booty bass, mainstream pop, 
and rock within the existing breakbeat framework. The result is a 
road-tested, hyperkinetic blend of beats, sure to pique the interest of 
hardcore fans and casual listeners alike.


DJ MARK YURM // Atlanta, GA // breaks

Household Management //
www.householdatlanta.com
www.myspace.com/markyurm
www.oneloveskateshop.com

DJ Mark Yurm is the alter ego of Brandon Couturier, and is primarily a 
breakbeat DJ from Atlanta, GA. He has been rocking dance floors since 
1994. He is one of the most well rounded DJ.s to ever come out of 
Atlanta, mixing anything from House Music, to Drum N Bass (as The 
Rainmaker), and everything in between. He specializes in broken beats 
including Breaks & 2 Step, although he has been know to drop sick 
Electro set now and then as well. With such an arsenal of styles it is 
no wonder why when Mark Yurm is on the decks, there is definitely a 
party going on. Mark has played along such legendary acts as DJ Magic 
Mike, Rennie Pilgrem, Adam F, Hive, DB, Sharaz, Fiction and Spice, 
Donald Glaude, Terry Mullan, Phantom 45, Deekline, Rick West, Capital J, 
Huda Hudia, DJ Funk, Dave Christophere, and many many more. His blend of 
mixing in and out of broken beats with 4/4 runners can only be simply 
described as fun. His sets are sure to make the heart pump, and the feet 
move, in ways that you would have never expected. Now embarking into his 
fifteenth year of being a DJ, Mr.Yurm looks to progress the sounds that 
have taken care of him even further. In 2009, Mark Yurm has re-joined 
forces with long time manager, and best friend, MJ, to re-launch 
Household Atlanta, a company which includes Artist Management, and large 
scale Event Showcases, as well as a soon to be launched record label. 
Mark will not only handle new artist acquisitions and information for 
Household Management, he will also be starting to tour again this year. 
Excitement is the word coming out of Atlanta, as Household, and Mark 
Yurm, look to be one of the next driving forces of dance music for years 
to come on a global basis.

Hailing from the renown Midwest Breakbeat Camp, Give Us A Break! founder 
Stuart Allen and pioneer Adam S have been making a name for themselves 
across the midwest. playing one-off raves and club gigs every other 
weekend across the tri-State area. These two drop banger after banger in 
every set they play. impeccable track selection combined with a keen ear 
for new and rowdy mixes make this breakbeat duo a Midwest favorite. 
Stuart Allen started buying records in 1996. His love of music and his 
desire for official breakbeat representation in Dayton Ohio led him to 
establish Give Us A Break! in 2003. This is where he met up his partner

www.myspace.com/coreyvacate

Vacate, the founder of Wreck and Rep, is a rising force in the stateside 
Drum & Bass and Dubstep movement. With releases on Shift Recordings, 
like the bass killing, light bulb busting "Body Flip" and on Dirty 
Circuit Records with the raw, bar brawl worthy "Vibe Crusha" no sound 
system is safe. His remix of AC Slater's "Hello" is starting to rip 
through the dance floors' with its menacing wobble bass. Between killing 
shows with his insanely, high energized, quick mixed sets and his tracks 
being played worldwide, there is no question that this midwest talent is 
no longer laying back in the shadows.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

7UP (Steel City Funk)
Pittsburgh PA

For longer then many can remember, the name 7up has been synonymous with 
the house scene dropping his unique mixing style at hundreds of events 
and every major nightclub in Pittsburgh and major cities around the 
States. Over Dave.s history he has brought many new styles of house to 
Pittsburgh including Speed Garage in 1997, to the short but sweet 2-Step 
trend that came and went with the millennium, right up the present 
incarnations of deep and funky house which he rocks on the dancefloor, 
leaving a trail of satisfied party goers in his path. As anyone will

DEEKLINE // LONDON // UNITED KINGDOM

RAT RECORDS // HOT CAKES // BOOTY BREAKS

CUT & RUN // SLUDGE // HARDCORE BEATS


www.myspace.com/djdeekline


Deekline; DJ, producer, mega hot remixer and founder of Rat Records, 
Hardcore Beats, Cut & Run, Hot Cakes, Booty Breaks, and Sludge, has come 
along way since his smash hit "Don't Smoke The Reefer" back in 1998. 
With 15 tours of the US and North America, 4 tours of Australia and 2 
tours of New Zealand, you may have caught him in the past 10 years 
playing in some major city from Chicago to London, or Sydney to Spain. 
His unique and ground breaking sound blows up parties the world over, 
sending shockwaves through the industry leaving others inspired and 
following in his footsteps.

As a youngster, Deekline (aka Nick Annand) started collecting records 
inspired by funk and electro, before becoming interested in hardcore and 
jungle; which led to him being at the forefront of breakbeat culture 
from its birth. He has become an iconic name within the breakbeat, Miami 
bass and dance scene, creating his own unique sound of breakbeat with an 
electro twist.

Deekline.s collaboration with partner Wizard, has led to the duo being 
recognised more prominently as one of breakbeat.s most uber-production 
partnerships. Their new album .Back Off. (Supercharged) has earned rave 
reviews and new single .Angels. has seen remixes from MJ Cole & NAPT 
whilst .Back Off. named after the album has been playlisted on Annie 
Nightingale.s Radio 1 show.

Deekline.s official remix with FreQ Nasty of Old Dirty Bastards "Every 
Posse & Crew" rocketed into the dance charts in the UK, whilst his "Got 
Your Money" remix earned him maximum kudos in the breaks, garage, Miami 
bass and 2-step scenes. Other major remixes include Armand Van Helden 
.My My My. (Deekline & Wizard) which Zane Lowe made his record of the 
week on his Radio1 show, The Prodigy.s .Outta Space., Freestylers .Boom 
Blast., new single .Whats Up. with Tittsworth feat Kid Sister and Fort 
Know Five.s .Funk For Peace..

His single with Ed Solo and Darrison .Touch Your Toes. was signed to 
Norman Cook.s .Skint. label and went on to full release in the summer of 
2006. In his 12-year career Deekline has also been signed to Warner, 
Super Star, Southern Fried Records, Supercharged, Botchit & Scarper, and 
Against The Grain and his own Rat Records label, now has in excess of 50 
releases. Rat Records is a huge part of the breakbeat scene for its 
attention to high quality releases, and pioneering DJs and Producers 
such as JFB, Crissy Chris (Radio1) and Ed Solo.

Deekline himself has worked and continues to work with heavyweight 
producers such as Tim Healey, Wizard, Ed Solo, DJ Assault, DJ Fresh, 
Stanton Warriors, Arthur Baker, Freestylers, and Fort Knox Five, not to 
mention vocalists Ivory, Yolanda, Wiley, and TopCat. 2008 saw him 
produce singles for Ivory, Shystie, and Slyde Beats.

2009 brings new production and remixes for Shystie .New Style. and 
.Don.t Let Go. Yo Majesty. This year is set to be a phenomenal year for 
DJ Deekline, his partner Wizard and all other collaborators that work 
with him.

This year expect to see Deekline taking centre stage at WMC (America) 
Shambala (Canada), Burning Man (Nevada), and Glastonbury (UK) to name 
but a few. Where he.ll continue to make booty.s bounce and the girls 
wiggle.


KEITH MACKENZIE // Chicago

www.myspace.com/illeveneleven

GUESTLIST, #1 ON BEATPORT BREAKS

Originally from Tampa, FL, Chicago resident Keith MacKenzie has been at 
the forefront of all things breakbeat for well over a decade as part of 
DJ Icey's mighty Zone Records label. After multiple releases and high 
profile collaborations with the likes of Icey, Infiniti and DJ Fixx (as 
KMFX) on established US labels like Zone, Afterdark and Bottom-End 
Records, Keith created his own imprint, Illeven:Eleven. Now 10 releases 
deep, the label continues to function as a conduit of sorts, melding and 
combining fresh sounds by up and coming and established US talent with 
their overseas counterparts in an attempt to smash breakbeat genre 
conventions. For the past 8 years, Keith has also kept an energetic 
touring calendar, playing upfront DJ sets to very receptive crowds 
across the US and internationally. The Booty Breaks sound has been 
conceived from the ground up as a reflection of the ever changing 
palette of the average dance music lover. Taking it's cues from current 
short attention span-addled dancefloor trends, it incorporates elements 
from disparate genres like house, hip hop/booty bass, mainstream pop, 
and rock within the existing breakbeat framework. The result is a 
road-tested, hyperkinetic blend of beats, sure to pique the interest of 
hardcore fans and casual listeners alike.


DJ MARK YURM // Atlanta, GA // breaks

Household Management //
www.householdatlanta.com
www.myspace.com/markyurm
www.oneloveskateshop.com

DJ Mark Yurm is the alter ego of Brandon Couturier, and is primarily a 
breakbeat DJ from Atlanta, GA. He has been rocking dance floors since 
1994. He is one of the most well rounded DJ.s to ever come out of 
Atlanta, mixing anything from House Music, to Drum N Bass (as The 
Rainmaker), and everything in between. He specializes in broken beats 
including Breaks & 2 Step, although he has been know to drop sick 
Electro set now and then as well. With such an arsenal of styles it is 
no wonder why when Mark Yurm is on the decks, there is definitely a 
party going on. Mark has played along such legendary acts as DJ Magic 
Mike, Rennie Pilgrem, Adam F, Hive, DB, Sharaz, Fiction and Spice, 
Donald Glaude, Terry Mullan, Phantom 45, Deekline, Rick West, Capital J, 
Huda Hudia, DJ Funk, Dave Christophere, and many many more. His blend of 
mixing in and out of broken beats with 4/4 runners can only be simply 
described as fun. His sets are sure to make the heart pump, and the feet 
move, in ways that you would have never expected. Now embarking into his 
fifteenth year of being a DJ, Mr.Yurm looks to progress the sounds that 
have taken care of him even further. In 2009, Mark Yurm has re-joined 
forces with long time manager, and best friend, MJ, to re-launch 
Household Atlanta, a company which includes Artist Management, and large 
scale Event Showcases, as well as a soon to be launched record label. 
Mark will not only handle new artist acquisitions and information for 
Household Management, he will also be starting to tour again this year. 
Excitement is the word coming out of Atlanta, as Household, and Mark 
Yurm, look to be one of the next driving forces of dance music for years 
to come on a global basis.

dayton, oh // kate worldwide // tech house

commanding dance floors for the past 17 years. Not many djs can claim 
that they have opened for Sasha and Digweed, Paul Van Dyk, BT, Deadmau5, 
Ferry Corsten, the Crystal Method, Dirty Vegas, Darude, Bad Boy Bill, 
Steve Porter, and dj Rap. The list goes on and on. Tonys unique blend of 
tech house ranges full spectrum, from techno to funky. Full of amazing 
crescendos, his legendary sets have gained notoriety over the years. If 
you heard his set on nye or at SIKE! you'll know what to expect!!


STUART ALLEN VS ADAM S
dayton // guab // breakbeat

www.myspace.com/stuartallen138
www.myspace.com/schrimpin

Hailing from the renown Midwest Breakbeat Camp, Give Us A Break! founder 
Stuart Allen and pioneer Adam S have been making a name for themselves 
across the midwest. playing one-off raves and club gigs every other 
weekend across the tri-State area. These two drop banger after banger in 
every set they play. impeccable track selection combined with a keen ear 
for new and rowdy mixes make this breakbeat duo a Midwest favorite. 
Stuart Allen started buying records in 1996. His love of music and his 
desire for official breakbeat representation in Dayton Ohio led him to 
establish Give Us A Break! in 2003. This is where he met up his partner 
Adam S, and the two have been playing shows together ever since. Since 
then everything form their label, their roster, their events, and their 
city, have been gaining national attention by leaps and bounds.


VACATE
Drum and Bass // Dubstep - Columbus, OH

Wreck and Rep /// Shift Recordings /// Dirty Circuit

www.myspace.com/coreyvacate

Vacate, the founder of Wreck and Rep, is a rising force in the stateside 
Drum & Bass and Dubstep movement. With releases on Shift Recordings, 
like the bass killing, light bulb busting "Body Flip" and on Dirty 
Circuit Records with the raw, bar brawl worthy "Vibe Crusha" no sound 
system is safe. His remix of AC Slater's "Hello" is starting to rip 
through the dance floors' with its menacing wobble bass. Between killing 
shows with his insanely, high energized, quick mixed sets and his tracks 
being played worldwide, there is no question that this midwest talent is 
no longer laying back in the shadows.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

DEEKLINE // LONDON // UNITED KINGDOM

RAT RECORDS // HOT CAKES // BOOTY BREAKS

CUT & RUN // SLUDGE // HARDCORE BEATS


www.myspace.com/djdeekline


Deekline; DJ, producer, mega hot remixer and founder of Rat Records, 
Hardcore Beats, Cut & Run, Hot Cakes, Booty Breaks, and Sludge, has come 
along way since his smash hit "Don't Smoke The Reefer" back in 1998. 
With 15 tours of the US and North America, 4 tours of Australia and 2 
tours of New Zealand, you may have caught him in the past 10 years 
playing in some major city from Chicago to London, or Sydney to Spain. 
His unique and ground breaking sound blows up parties the world over, 
sending shockwaves through the industry leaving others inspired and 
following in his footsteps.

As a youngster, Deekline (aka Nick Annand) started collecting records 
inspired by funk and electro, before becoming interested in hardcore and 
jungle; which led to him being at the forefront of breakbeat culture 
from its birth. He has become an iconic name within the breakbeat, Miami 
bass and dance scene, creating his own unique sound of breakbeat with an 
electro twist.

Deekline.s collaboration with partner Wizard, has led to the duo being 
recognised more prominently as one of breakbeat.s most uber-production 
partnerships. Their new album .Back Off. (Supercharged) has earned rave 
reviews and new single .Angels. has seen remixes from MJ Cole & NAPT 
whilst .Back Off. named after the album has been playlisted on Annie 
Nightingale.s Radio 1 show.

Deekline.s official remix with FreQ Nasty of Old Dirty Bastards "Every 
Posse & Crew" rocketed into the dance charts in the UK, whilst his "Got 
Your Money" remix earned him maximum kudos in the breaks, garage, Miami 
bass and 2-step scenes. Other major remixes include Armand Van Helden 
.My My My. (Deekline & Wizard) which Zane Lowe made his record of the 
week on his Radio1 show, The Prodigy.s .Outta Space., Freestylers .Boom 
Blast., new single .Whats Up. with Tittsworth feat Kid Sister and Fort 
Know Five.s .Funk For Peace..

His single with Ed Solo and Darrison .Touch Your Toes. was signed to 
Norman Cook.s .Skint. label and went on to full release in the summer of 
2006. In his 12-year career Deekline has also been signed to Warner, 
Super Star, Southern Fried Records, Supercharged, Botchit & Scarper, and 
Against The Grain and his own Rat Records label, now has in excess of 50 
releases. Rat Records is a huge part of the breakbeat scene for its 
attention to high quality releases, and pioneering DJs and Producers 
such as JFB, Crissy Chris (Radio1) and Ed Solo.

Deekline himself has worked and continues to work with heavyweight 
producers such as Tim Healey, Wizard, Ed Solo, DJ Assault, DJ Fresh, 
Stanton Warriors, Arthur Baker, Freestylers, and Fort Knox Five, not to 
mention vocalists Ivory, Yolanda, Wiley, and TopCat. 2008 saw him 
produce singles for Ivory, Shystie, and Slyde Beats.

2009 brings new production and remixes for Shystie .New Style. and 
.Don.t Let Go. Yo Majesty. This year is set to be a phenomenal year for 
DJ Deekline, his partner Wizard and all other collaborators that work 
with him.

This year expect to see Deekline taking centre stage at WMC (America) 
Shambala (Canada), Burning Man (Nevada), and Glastonbury (UK) to name 
but a few. Where he.ll continue to make booty.s bounce and the girls 
wiggle.


KEITH MACKENZIE // Chicago

www.myspace.com/illeveneleven

GUESTLIST, #1 ON BEATPORT BREAKS

Originally from Tampa, FL, Chicago resident Keith MacKenzie has been at 
the forefront of all things breakbeat for well over a decade as part of 
DJ Icey's mighty Zone Records label. After multiple releases and high 
profile collaborations with the likes of Icey, Infiniti and DJ Fixx (as 
KMFX) on established US labels like Zone, Afterdark and Bottom-End 
Records, Keith created his own imprint, Illeven:Eleven. Now 10 releases 
deep, the label continues to function as a conduit of sorts, melding and 
combining fresh sounds by up and coming and established US talent with 
their overseas counterparts in an attempt to smash breakbeat genre 
conventions. For the past 8 years, Keith has also kept an energetic 
touring calendar, playing upfront DJ sets to very receptive crowds 
across the US and internationally. The Booty Breaks sound has been 
conceived from the ground up as a reflection of the ever changing 
palette of the average dance music lover. Taking it's cues from current 
short attention span-addled dancefloor trends, it incorporates elements 
from disparate genres like house, hip hop/booty bass, mainstream pop, 
and rock within the existing breakbeat framework. The result is a 
road-tested, hyperkinetic blend of beats, sure to pique the interest of 
hardcore fans and casual listeners alike.


DJ MARK YURM // Atlanta, GA // breaks

Household Management //
www.householdatlanta.com
www.myspace.com/markyurm
www.oneloveskateshop.com

DJ Mark Yurm is the alter ego of Brandon Couturier, and is primarily a 
breakbeat DJ from Atlanta, GA. He has been rocking dance floors since 
1994. He is one of the most well rounded DJ.s to ever come out of 
Atlanta, mixing anything from House Music, to Drum N Bass (as The 
Rainmaker), and everything in between. He specializes in broken beats 
including Breaks & 2 Step, although he has been know to drop sick 
Electro set now and then as well. With such an arsenal of styles it is 
no wonder why when Mark Yurm is on the decks, there is definitely a 
party going on. Mark has played along such legendary acts as DJ Magic 
Mike, Rennie Pilgrem, Adam F, Hive, DB, Sharaz, Fiction and Spice, 
Donald Glaude, Terry Mullan, Phantom 45, Deekline, Rick West, Capital J, 
Huda Hudia, DJ Funk, Dave Christophere, and many many more. His blend of 
mixing in and out of broken beats with 4/4 runners can only be simply 
described as fun. His sets are sure to make the heart pump, and the feet 
move, in ways that you would have never expected. Now embarking into his 
fifteenth year of being a DJ, Mr.Yurm looks to progress the sounds that 
have taken care of him even further. In 2009, Mark Yurm has re-joined 
forces with long time manager, and best friend, MJ, to re-launch 
Household Atlanta, a company which includes Artist Management, and large 
scale Event Showcases, as well as a soon to be launched record label. 
Mark will not only handle new artist acquisitions and information for 
Household Management, he will also be starting to tour again this year. 
Excitement is the word coming out of Atlanta, as Household, and Mark 
Yurm, look to be one of the next driving forces of dance music for years 
to come on a global basis.

Considered by many as Ohio's best house dj, Tony Desaro has been 
commanding dance floors for the past 17 years. Not many djs can claim 
that they have opened for Sasha and Digweed, Paul Van Dyk, BT, Deadmau5, 
Ferry Corsten, the Crystal Method, Dirty Vegas, Darude, Bad Boy Bill, 
Steve Porter, and dj Rap. The list goes on and on. Tonys unique blend of 
tech house ranges full spectrum, from techno to funky. Full of amazing 
crescendos, his legendary sets have gained notoriety over the years. If 
you heard his set on nye or at SIKE! you'll know what to expect!!


STUART ALLEN VS ADAM S
dayton // guab // breakbeat

www.myspace.com/stuartallen138
www.myspace.com/schrimpin

Hailing from the renown Midwest Breakbeat Camp, Give Us A Break! founder 
Stuart Allen and pioneer Adam S have been making a name for themselves 
across the midwest. playing one-off raves and club gigs every other 
weekend across the tri-State area. These two drop banger after banger in 
every set they play. impeccable track selection combined with a keen ear 
for new and rowdy mixes make this breakbeat duo a Midwest favorite. 
Stuart Allen started buying records in 1996. His love of music and his 
desire for official breakbeat representation in Dayton Ohio led him to 
establish Give Us A Break! in 2003. This is where he met up his partner 
Adam S, and the two have been playing shows together ever since. Since 
then everything form their label, their roster, their events, and their 
city, have been gaining national attention by leaps and bounds.


VACATE
Drum and Bass // Dubstep - Columbus, OH

Wreck and Rep /// Shift Recordings /// Dirty Circuit

www.myspace.com/coreyvacate

Vacate, the founder of Wreck and Rep, is a rising force in the stateside 
Drum & Bass and Dubstep movement. With releases on Shift Recordings, 
like the bass killing, light bulb busting "Body Flip" and on Dirty 
Circuit Records with the raw, bar brawl worthy "Vibe Crusha" no sound 
system is safe. His remix of AC Slater's "Hello" is starting to rip 
through the dance floors' with its menacing wobble bass. Between killing 
shows with his insanely, high energized, quick mixed sets and his tracks 
being played worldwide, there is no question that this midwest talent is 
no longer laying back in the shadows.

It.s a PB/CLE thing.

Presenting our very own PB/CLE locals, OLD and NEW!

Darw_n
(United Groove, Psychoactive, www.jointhedemonstration.com ~ CLE)
Bringing upwards of 20 years involvement to the midwest dance scene, 
darw_n returns to pittsburgh after a long hiatus to lay down his 4 deck 
assault. Being a long time regular to pittsburgh during the party era of 
the 90's, come and re-experience his driving, mental tech house sets, or 
come get your mind blown for the first time.


Funkreformer
(Funkreform Productions, Housefusion ~ PB)
Funkreformer (a.k.a. Mr. Miles) was introduced to house music back in 
1991, and hasn.t looked back since. In 1993 he got ahold of his first 
pair of decks and began a lifelong love affair with percussion. He had 
regular monthly appearances on the now-legendary Free Radio Carson 91.7 
for years and held down quite a few residencies and guest appearances in 
local nightspots such as Lava Lounge, Metropol, and the infamous 
afterhours club Liquified. Blending the many different shades of House, 
Minimal and Techno, this guy is especially known for his ability to 
smoothly progress his sets from one mood to the next, taking his 
audience on a journey like never before heard. Better buckle up folks.


Moose
(Breakbeat Militia, Infinite Velocity ~ CLE)
Ever since kindergarten, moose has been making mixtapes. Well, probably 
not the type of mixtapes you're thinking of, but rather, radio tapes. 
Moose wanted to be a DJ on the radio so bad, that he and friends would 
make tapes with a tape recorder, a microphone, and songs recorded off of 
the radio. Since then, DJing has become more then just a dream for moose 
by establishing himself as a well recognized name in the Pittsburgh / 
Cleveland / Columbus / Cincinnati rave scenes. Moose spun at his first 
party in August of 1999; Nuclear Confusion thrown by Infinite Velocity 
Productions in Johnstown, PA. Soon after, he was asked to join Infinite 
Velocity's roster, an affiliation that moose has always cherished and 
valued. Since then, moose has spun at countless events all around Ohio 
and Pennsylvania.

Clevr
(Nex Nap, Breakbeat Militia ~ PB)
Clevr was born at a discotech in the middle of the dance floor and so he 
was destined to rock the masses. He has been controlling crowds behind 
the decks since 1997. You are sure to hear a funky and energized set of 
House and Breaks when Clevr is on the wheels. A crowd pleaser to the 
core he never fails to get the job done.

Fuzz
(United Groove, Psychoactive ~ CLE)
As one of the original Psychoactive members Fuzz has earned quite the 
reputation as a floor shaker. From the utterly massive 420 to the rock 
solid weeklies he was a part of,  every set of his pumps a level of
energy that fills the dancefloor with the perfect vibe. Now with the 
return of Psychoactive to the Cleveland scene Fuzz is sure to make his 
mark once again.

Tranz am
(1st Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
San Franscico///Hardcore
//powerinmusic.com, triatom, loveallstars, San Fransisco hardcore//

This guy enjoys rockin' all types of Hardcore, especially the Freeform 
beats, but behind the scenes he plays it all. Yep that's right from 
house to hardcore and every genre in between. He has ventured into it 
and it keeps him on his toes. His main background consists of Breaks, 
Hard House, NRG, & Trance. Before he got into spinning Hardcore in 2005, 
he was actually spinning a lot of deep funky house. Tranz Am is a strong 
believer in the people, together they can move mountains, whatever they 
desire. There is power in the people, and power in music! Tranz AM is 
here to bring you positive vibes and good times, to bring you just a 
little closer to the sun. So when you see him up there on the decks 
don't be bashful, just get on the floor and burn it up!

Ronstoppable
(1st Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
Baltimore//Breaks & Electro
//ID Productions, Breakout Crew//

Ron got started spinning breaks in 2001. He dove straight into Flordia 
breaks and then UK breaks caught his fancy. He is known to mix some 
funky electro house into his sets to help him burn up the dance floors. 
He is currently a resident at Shorty's in B.More (previously owned by 
the legendary Charles Feelgood), as well as Liberty in Philly. He has 
been bangin' it out in clubs all up and down the east coast. We are 
proud to bring his floor rumbling sounds to the Steel City!

DVS
(Happy Birthday!!)
Pittsburgh//The funkiest house you have ever heard.
B.A.D. Ass, Koala-tea

Here is a man we all know and love. He hardly needs an introduction. 
With his undeniable stage presence and funky track selection he will 
keep your feet moving your, booty bouncing, and your face grinning for 
the entire set he's playing. His energy on stage is unstoppable. Truly a 
sight to be seen. Don't miss out on this wild man!!

DJ Firefly
www.djfirefly.com, www.myspace.com/couchdancing
Pittsburgh//deep, intoxicating sounds

Firefly grew up surrounded by music. Needless to say, this has rubbed 
off on her quite a bit. Wanting to spread her love of music, she began 
hosting a weekly radio show in 2005. Make sure you check her out 
Wednesdays from 3-5:30pm on WRTC (88.3) for some intoxicating deep 
sounds. She has held a residency at the Firehouse Lounge in the strip as 
well as other clubs around the burgh. Don't miss out on her beautiful 
sounds this night!

CO2
Pittsburgh area//Techno sexiness
Technoir Audio

Chris began his djing experience in 1998 when he bought his first 
turntables. This is a man who loves microwaves and hates video games 
that cost more than 25 cents. His love of techno began when he realized 
that mainstream radio was crap and he was hunting for a sound that was 
"new" and "better". Techno was an obvious choice for him since he still 
needs to hunt for "that" sound. He will be here this night to deliver 
what he has found to you!

Doverspike and ?????
