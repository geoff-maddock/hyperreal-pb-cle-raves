-- after all of the latest discussion about $$, idlike to throw in my
opinion. $18 (or 20) does seem a bit pricey, i agree with you there, but
this is a rave. to me, it is worth a lot more than $18. It might be because
i am relatively new to the scene, but I always come out of a rave happy and
satisfied (and that aint no bologne!) believe it or not, i only got to hear
half of the djs, but EVERYONE on the dancefloor was straight-up kickin it
w/baggadonuts+smoov, and i know by your reactions you thought it was dope too!

I just felt like sayin a little something, but udg also had to foot the bill
on some rather pricey lasers (that didn't work while i was there) and a bomb
ass lighting show, so you have to take that into consideration.

thats all..

Anyone go to Trilogy last night?  It was amazing the difference between
midnight and 2:00 A.M., at least musically.  Scott Forbush was the dj, and
as you know the guy loves gutter.  So, for guys like me who appreciate the
more hypnotic rhythms of trance and acid trance, the refuge was in the
upper back bar and the small room (which featured deep house, techno and a
little funk house).

Then, at 2:00, the 200 bps hard gunfire of the main floor dissolved into
TB303 heaven.  I dug the difference (maybe Ian M. pushed Scott out).  In
any case, what got me was the majority of dancers couldn't sense the
difference.  You know how at a rave you can always sense the ebb and flow
of dancers with the style of music?  Well, it was as if these kids
couldn't tell.  There were no looks of pure glee from the trance lovers or
looks of disappoinment from the hard house flocks.  Of course, there were
exceptions, but these were mainly the minority of those in the know.  What
has happened to this club?  Its popularity has definitely changed the
ambience.  I'm not one to judge a person by their style or clothes, but
listening to conversations, I couldn't believe how brusk and ignorant some
of the people were.  At raves, there is such a vibe of all inclusive
acceptance and loving.  This was a world away.  I've never heard so many
swear words used as adjectives or seen so many Metallica rejects.  If
there was a time for Covert to be reinstated, this is the time.

Nevertheless, between Trilogy and nothing, there's no contest.  What do
you think?

Braden

Well if either of you had gone (you OR Frank) you would have probably 
had a blast as did all the other people that went. I do think it is 
unfair to blame UDG Inc for the proce considering they were just a 
partner in this with someone else. If Carlos and Reese weren't worth it 
for you then fine. How about YOU do this. Fly out half your DJ's from out 
of town (1 from the west coast) Hire Thunder and Lighting to do sound 
lights and bring a laser. Oh and did I mention they were Cyberlights? 
Nuff said. You put together a party like that here in Pittsburgh (which 
has been suffering to low turnout on even the cheap parties) for less and 
then you have something to stand on. SOme math for you

low turnout = higher price.

I highly doubt UDG made anything off this party INFACT I think they may 
just have broke even.

What hell is that? No hell broke loose as a result of the Pittsburgh Post

blurb about a new german church service, apperently very quick and 
involving lots of techno and smoke and whatnot ..

major religions of the world utilizing techno to attract new, young

That would be the 1.8.7 mix of the Starchild vs. 1.8.7 track "The Way We 
Rock" which samples Fugeela. Currently on a *very* limited edition dubplate.

Does this mean tomarrow, June 4th is the first date, or this is just the 
lineup for the first date in june, no 'actual-date given'?

Unrelated: Anyone know if 168 would be open to having smaller out of town 
dance-acts play there, like the slew of small industrial-ebm acts that 
wouldn't have anywhere to play in pgh now that cloud-9 is history?

Another thought:  I don't know the general public's thoughts on such an 
idea, but I'd sure like to see maybe a one-off all hardcore event in pgh 
- happy, breakbeat, gabber, old skool - maybe even at 168, or JiveTurkeys 
would be interested.  Or maybe it's just not pgh's thing. Just throwin' 
out the idea. :)

i think that this would be a great idea!!!!
have a total hardcore bash with all styles of hardcore dance music represented.
hardstep jungle, happy hardcore, gabber, some old 92 hardcore, possibly 
some industrial, hard trance.....ect...
anything with a hard edge to it.
and if it's not pittsburgh's thing...so what!  i think alot of us here would
really like something like this to wake us up even if we don't realize it
right now.

my vote is YES YES YES!

love,
ryu

Basically, what "yo check it kids..." means is :

IF YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A PITTSBURGH RENEGADE, well then YOU'VE
NEVER LIVED.  Damnit, this shit is PHRESH PHUNKY and a billion other
PH words.  I mean, really, in all seriousness, I have NEVER had as
much fun at any party (sober) as I did at the last Jive Turkeyz party.
Every important style of techno music ws represented there, and taking
a quick look at this lineup, its gonna be true this time too.
Besides, theres nothing like gettin' hardcore jollies under tha moon
and stars, but most importantly under the BEAUTIFUL PITTSBURGH
SKYLINE.  Shit kids, if more people don't start coming to Pittsburgh,
the lord is gonna call me home! ;) Now, I know lately I may have been
caught dissing the burgh (or maybe just promoters in the burgh?) BUT
REALLY this is where shit's AT!!! You must come to this party, its
like a moral imperative.  ITS FREEEE for cryin' out loud! (well,
they'll be happy to take a MUCH DESERVED donation of course ;) gas
costs $$ after all, and gas is the source of POWER for the generator
that runs the sound and light. Soooo, kids, like the man like
Formation said "CHECK IT!"

Well, Steve has a point.  the "eventually they will" know what "raves" 
(whatever that means) are.  It will happen b/c ravers and sympathizers 
are growing up and getting positions in the system and the media, and 
outside of it and stuff.  

The results will be good and bad, as they 
always have been.  Then in ten years everything will calm down and we'll 
all look back at this and laugh.

How good or bad things will get remains to be seen...but b/c of the 
nature of subcultures like this, the media can't really have THAT much of 
a direct effect on the core of the scene.

whatever.  ta.

oh, but one more thing, is that it really is safer NOT to trust the 
media...b/c sometimes even THEY don't know when they're screwing up.  
It's just getting worse in the mainstream, TV a lot more than 
newspapers.  Everybody wants a juicier story than the next guy/gal. 
 The hipper, the more on the cutting edge they seem to each other 
and feckless audiences that love to be told what to fear, the 
better. Magazines are the safest area....but enough of that.

yeah i have to agree...trilogy is the only time and place i really can 
dance and have fun on a regular basis.  i cannot afford the big or good 
parties.  cleveland is the closest place i have and i am glad it has a 
scene.  
	the trilogy vibe sucks any more now and many of friends refuse to go 
becasue of that.  i like it when it is hard core.  the vibe of the 
people suck because most of them are wasted.  when i dance i like to be 
in  my own relm but when drunk pukes are stepping on me it really recks 
the groove.  i love the parties i go to when there is room and where 
there are people hoe respect and love the same things.

joe had included the info line # at the bottom of the post...i'm gonna
assume your in the local area...if you had called you would have realised
that it was a typo...first date is june 11 and it is $3 to get in...not bad
at all :)


i dont know how long it runs tho, the info line didnt list hours, but you
can call club 168 and find out there...

I just flashed back to my first rave which was GatoRave in good ol '92 - held
at metropol :-/  Anyway, it was billed as Pittsburgh's "first 100% Hardcore
Rave".  Of course I would have just scratched my head if someone mentioned
"hardstep jungle" but, as I remember, the crowd had no objection :-)

Well, Steve has a point.  the "eventually they will" know what "raves" 
(whatever that means) are.  It will happen b/c ravers and sympathizers 
are growing up and getting positions in the system and the media, and 
outside of it and stuff.  
=================================================================

actually it wuz brad who said that...just to give props where props
are due.

but i think it's pretty obvious that eventually the rest of the world
wil be clued in. then maybe all the workers out there like joe, steve
cinch, ed & the ele mentals, & the rest of the overworked under paid
dj's & promotors out there will finally get what they deserve some 
real fundage rather than the peanuts they work for today!

On this note:

 actually Stickman (rick- a Jive Turkey) and I were just discussing this 
same thing last week, after listening to a bit o' Deadly Buda and D-Cypol 
tapes... ahhh an all hardcore party would be just the thing to relive old 
times, and give newer faces a glimpse of what else is out there... 
Variety is the spice of life, yes, but nowadays hearing a diverse style 
of muzik at a party is often few and far between.

Even though I am no longer in Pittsburgh this summer, I fully support the 
Jive Turkeys in any efforts they may make to make something like this 
possible, and I challenge all the promoters to do likewise.  (BTW: it was 
nice for UDG to book Reese at The Phanny Dance... he brought me back to 
the days o' olde--- 'cept for that $22 dollar door charge-- 
whatdaphunk?!)

	are quite a few older hardcore techno and gabber tracks lurking in

hey i keep seeing that cedar point commercial with the techno in the
background - theres a second one now.  the first had an alien theme goin on,
the second talkes about why you would never step on a mantis - but both have
techno in the background.  But theres more!  There is this new tv show about
fire fighters that uses jungle in the background of the fire scenes!  i was
impressed.  There i was, channel flipping and suddenly i heard it!  

just thought id share :)

lots of luv

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

	Yeah...I was forced to watch that '9021H2O' show and there was a 
definate fake jungleist riff......kinda scary. Almost like Tyree on 'The

  that would be soooo rad.  especially with your junglist reputation, to 
see peoples reaction when you spun a screaming gabber track. :P
  
  I don't really know any promoters very well, but I'd be willing to help 
out anyone who's willing to take up the task - be it jivet's, UDG, any 
other local promoters, or hex, anyone who knows of a space/gear/dj's who 
can come together for something like this.  I know there's lots of people 
who'd come out for a hardcore partysome - in part to relive 
the 'deadly budda' dayz, and in part just for the change of pace.  Plus 
personally I love dancin' to hardcore. ;)

  any thoughts/ideas accepted,

well we have deformed wednesdays in youngstown, but i dont know how well
that sort of thing would go over with 90% of our crowd.  if you guys are
serious i could see about getting the bar on an off night.  with there being
bands and other stuff, that leaves sundays and mondays.  let me know.....

if anyone has transcriptions of any rave-related newspaper article or tv

its own pages but i want to incorporate the two a little.  especially 
with regard to the pittsburgh stuff that was going on around the time of 
TUNNEL VISION.

anyone?

well i have one from last summer in the youngstown vindicator when the
sugarkids threw origins.  basically them bragging and stuff.  i can xerox it
and send it out, coz i dont have time to type it.  i'm actually practicing
spinning and stuph!  so when do we get to spin one of your partees?  ;)
i talked to lee from ups and he said to get ahold of him about f.a. 2  coz
he would like to get some representation from ele-guys.  
i'd love for some of you guys to come up here and spin some night.  i've
talked to charles and kevin alittle about it, but you and titonton are more
than welcome as well.  and the rest too!  i know its a drive (i've made it
enuff!) but let me know if you'd be willing to do it sometime.
have you put a link to the calendar off my page?  also i have 2 new ones,
one for deformed wednesdays and one for other party related stuff.  laters,
jamie...

I really like the scene in the Northside and would liek to contribute an
just an idea.
I realize thats its probably petty and not really an issue, but here it goes:
I went to SUCK and WISE and had a blast. I noticed though that they were
running the sound through two bass amps; bass sounded decent, but the
dynamic range could have been better.
Now I realize Thats what you gotta do on a low budget and also keep in mind
the portable factor,
BUT:    You can rent for a night a 200 watt per channel PA thats really
decent with a 6 channel powered mixer for next to nothing at Piano's N
Stuff in Blawnox. Its costs like $22 or something insanley cheap and it can
fit very easily in the back of a van with dj equipment.

just throwin that out to anyone who looking for good sound at any type of party.
peace

p.s. Count Zero: sorry about the misunderstanding; someone said are there
any wise like raves coming soon, it slipped my mind that the wise was
reffering to the party not the adjective

I told Lorain County residents about raves two summers ago. No hell broke
loose, although I think a couple of events were held in Lorain.

I've been lurking for years, and I think I'm going to have to sign off.
Just got a job in Utica, N.Y., which isn't, even by a stretch,  in pb-cle-land.
Besides I'm getting too old for this stuff.

I love the music. Nothing like some Basic Channel thudding in your ears. But
I just can't stay up till 6 a.m. ``Raving Till Dawn,'' as it were. I'm a 
working man, now.

Anyway. I've met some of you on this list. It's been fun.

I can get you some post-gazette articles with a little phenagling....
other people might have them.  that would be easier for me.  I have the 
Post-gazette about Tunnel Vision, but there was a real cool article a 
little later that had a quote from a police officer that said the kids 
were so polite they didn't even cuss.

As I said, it will take some wrangling, so if you can get them from 
someone else, that would be great.  But let me know if no one has 'em.  

lots of peole have the Pittsburgh Tribune story abut Tunnel Vision, the 
one with the picture of those 2 girls doing lines of crystal meth.  Try 
1.8.7 if you can't get a hold of it cuz i know he has a copy. 

good luck, let me know if you need that stuff.

good stuff happening @ 168--great coffee drinks, alcohol and not.  good 
people, service with a plurry smile, rekkids, muzac, phat 
pants and nappy hair.  (oh, sorry, the nappy hair's just me--I really 
need to groom...)

and events, events, events.  Pittsburgh, I can't keep up with you 
anymore!!  That makes me happy.  Too many events, people, organizations, 
and dates to remember, to remember.  :)

Anyway, the strip bar may have died of yuppidom and capitalism 
(disrespect to the new owner, not the old), but 168 is quite the place to 
be.  

Will be more the place to be if more people come out!!! So even if ya 
don't have a car, remember, busses run from downtown till like 1:30 in the 
a.m.!  the club is usually open till 2, the cafe till 4.  it's comfy.  
it's stylish.  it's a great place to be.

thanks to all the pgh massive lighting a fire under it and putting on 
lots of events.  the r.o.m is full, that's great.  keep it up all, and 
the other all, do support.  it's good for you like wheaties.

I'll see you next to the speakers---if I ever get off work!!!!

smile, grin, and a big phatte giggle,
steph

in the beginning house was a feeling, and from this feeling came the music.
the music came together to create the atomosphere and then the summer of love.
but the people grew disillusioned and became divided. different forms of music
were created and a new generation of ravers were born. techno was the new
feeling. and from techno emerged music that incorporated sounds of a new era.
the music was more than just a feeling, it was a way of life. intelligent
music for intelligent minds. detrimental drums and bassline. music for the
future. so as the beats and the bass thunder down, we bring forth the knights
of the underground.

family reunion starts the night of july 5th & goes on 'til the 
night of july 6th.

Well, I guess you did!!!!
And More: IT"S ABSOLUTELY FREE!!
Wait did you say FREE???
YES YES YES!!!

'da Jive Turkeyz present  ORTHO
Saturday June 29th 1996 10pm to sunrise (same place as suck and wise)
Check out this line up:
Loki (industrial strength:)
Ruffian (fast breaks/drum and bass:)
Eric Justin (old skool drum and bass:)
1.8.7 will be spinning some old skool as well
d-Cypol (Happy Hardcore :)
much more TBA, all will be spinning either fast
breaks/industrial/noise/gabber/hardcore

24-hr Jive Turkeyz info line 412.389.9545

I just don't understand how you would want to miss this party;
same beautiful pittsburgh location;
much better sound system then the previous three parties (bigger generators
too);
and most of all it's a lot harder than what were used to.
I agree that we need to wake up and realize what weve been missing;
I'll be dancing all night!!!!!

props to Stickman Rick and da Jive Turkeyz for keepin the flavor in the raver
peace

p.s. CHARM, this friday is in the process of changing locations; keep
callin the infoline even though it was shut off.

    Date: Tue, 11 Jun

    
    Steve,
    
    I was just browsing on MW-Raves @ hyperreal.com and was wondering if you
    knew that I was head DJ @ trilogy...not to be rude but I am a little
    frustrated because of how I feel about the rave scene in this city...it
    feels like I'm pullin everyones weight and I am being shat upon...Do you
    know what's going on?  I would like to spread my knowledge to ravers, and it
    seems that I'm being blocked off from them and it hurts, because I am a
    raver too.
    
    This has been going on for some time, unfortunately I am just having time to
    open my eyes to it and see everyone basically stepping on me and what I am
    trying to do for the scene...
    
    Peeved...
    Ian.

    ok everyone, and stevie t, too...
    CHARM is this saturday, in dayton.  it's $5 (old skool!~ woohoo!) and
    vaporspace is the headliner.  it's gonna be really cool, i know that me
    (yes, me, i'm actually going to a party), becky, katerina, and kaykay are
    going.  ben (dj stupid cylert, heheh) will also be spinning.  i figure
    that will be a good time to nap. *duck*
    anyway, you can ask arash on vrave if you have any more questions...and we
    will most likely be doing breakfast, so kell, stevie, and all you others
    who will be there, keep that in mind. :)
    i'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled the following monday, so everyone be
    nice to me, or your bad karma will make me swell.
    -becca
    ps...stevie, bring kate!  and i should be in cleveland on the 22nd and
    after for the summer.

Oh my gosh!  Hmmm count, sorry I didn't halla earlier, but I didn't get 
request till after the fact.  I just got back - unfortunately I had to 
leave in the middle of dieselBoys set coz PAT was driving me home, but...

Steel City was the BOMB! There were lots and lots of jungle kids there, 
and for the first time, I didn't have a negative feeling about the club 
space.  I donna know what it was particularly, but I had a good time, and 
the charge was juuuuust right at $3 - I'v paid more and had less fun many 
times.  Next week the line up is:

                      187 - a live pa 
                      Farmer Tea
                      d.Cypol 
                    & Adair

 Which is a great lineup, demonstrating again pgh's massive collection of 
skilled junglists.  Its' like a wise old man once said "Pittsburgh Loves 
Jungle".  Amen. ;)

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

F A N T A S I A   I I

in the beginning house was a feeling, and from this feeling came the music.
the music came together to create the atomosphere and then the summer of 
love.
but the people grew disillusioned and became divided. different forms of 
music
were created and a new generation of ravers were born. techno was the new
feeling. and from techno emerged music that incorporated sounds of a new era.
the music was more than just a feeling, it was a way of life. intelligent
music for intelligent minds. detrimental drums and bassline. music for the
future. so as the beats and the bass thunder down, we bring forth the knights
of the underground.

Go to First Class Records in Wilkinsburg.  They are on Park Aveneue.  Go 
down Penn through the main part of Wilkinsburg coming from the west, and 
turn left at the light that has a Rally's Hamburger joint on the corner.  
That is Park Ave.  Follow that down and around the corner and First Class 
Records will be on your right hand side.  Tell Bubbles and Militant that 
Farmer sent you and they'll hook you up.  Everything from mixtapes to 
classic 7" 45's is available.  First Class has the most roots collection 
of any record store in the area.  Their phone number is 371-7511.

later,

lets all give three cheers for the six federal judges that today upheld the
temporary injunction on the parts of the Telecomm Act of 1996 that
prohibits transfer of what the government deems to be offensive/subversive
material over the internet including the monitoring of private e-mail
messages........as one judge put it "the Internet desrves the utmost
protection from government intrusion".......fukkin a right.....the judges
ruled that they interpreted the sections governing censorship of the
internet to be in direct violation of 1st ammendment rights and upheld the
tempoary injunction (which went into effect only days after the bill was
signed into law) until the ACLU's class action lawsuit against the federal
government for violation of 1st amendment rights could be heard and
decided.......chalk up one for the CYBERSPACE REVOLUTION!!!

okay, i know this is a little bit late, but i just got home and got all my
internet shit figured out.

in regards to the trance question---

i dont know why jeff!! i LOooOoooOOOoVe trance. it seems to me that the
past few times i have gone to a party, the only time i have really started
to have fun is when i have heard trance (or jungoOOL)---hrrrmmm...strange
huh?

but anyways, i have been away from cleveland so long, and i just wanted to
make one more comment.  about two weeks ago someone on pb-cle-raves made a
comment about trilogy, and whether to go or not.

well, i hate trilogy...but that is because of the club atmosphere. i went
on sunday and wasnt expecting to have a good time at all. (although the
last time i went i had a pretty cool time)...i started having a really
shitty evening b/c i got burned by THREE count them THREE cigarettes just
walking around, the guys at the bars suck about giving you water, and i
CANNOT stand all the stupid girls grinding with one another on the catwalk
above the bar while a bunch of drunk guidos drool and catcall to them--talk
about making me sick. why dont they fuckign get rid of that so we all dont
have to watch. all of the voyeurs should go to a strip joint and all of
those girls should follow them and get paid for it.grrrrr. all of this was
really pissing me off, until i realized the three redeeming factors:

1. the kids in the house room. there may be a bunch of fucks in the main
room and even in the house room, but the raver crowd and the nice people
make up for that. its a LOT better than it was about a year ago, and there
are starting to be a lot more kids representing. yay!!

2. someone in the main room was playing some really good jungle...and that
kind of eased my tension with the three cigarette burns =P
hahah...actually, i only have a good time there if i like the music, and
this started putting me in a good mood.

3. ian mariano-trance--i danced my ass off. last time i went to trilogy the
redeeming factor, was again, ian mariano. (although at that time i didnt
know it was him)...but anyways..his sets are the best part of the night,
b/c all the losers start to clear out and there is more room to dance to
that wonderful music. i LooOOOOooOOOove trance.


so there you have it. three reasons why last sunday i had an *excellent*
time even with the cigarette burns =P and i totally wasnt expecting it at
all.. i guess trilogy has improved since i went away to chicago.

and a few more comments:

no one *ever* knows who the djs are in any of the rooms at trilogy? whats
up with that..

who spins up in the top bar?? i went up there once, and there was some
really really nice music up there, i think it was some soft/spacey trance:
stuff that i would like to dance to in the main room, but you know thats
not goign to go over very well =P

haha..well anyways...

i'll be in cleveland indefinitely...sooooooo...

As a newcomer to the Columbus area I don't know where very much of 
anything is.  I am looking to find an import or at least order a copy of 
Prodigy's latest.  Everyone I've spoken to looks at me all glassy eyed 
and tells me no one around here orders imports and if I wait a few more 
weeks the domestic release will be available.  I don't want the domestic 
release.  So if anyone out there know's anywhere or anything and they 
could impart a little wisdom upon me, I would most appreciative.

There might not be anything different, than again there might be.  I'm 
not one to take chances on quality dance from artists like Prodigy, 
M-People, Massive Attack, etc.  For instance when Music For The Jilted 
Generation came out in America there was no difference between the 
domestic and import as far as track selection, but I did notice a 
dramatic difference between the quality of the cover art, the import was 
crisp and clean while the domestic was faded and a little washed out 
like it had been done on a bad scanner.  It is just little things, call 
me weird, call me crazy, but I get a certain satisfaction when I look 
down and see MADE IN ENGLAND stamped on my CD.  The bad thing is you'll 
pay about twice as much but I pose this question to you, aren't Prodigy 
some of the baddest motherfuckers around?, just listen to Firestarter 
if you have any doubts (Damn!) to me its worth the 24 bucks.  Anyhow in 
the classic sense, I doubt you'll get ripped off but I think its always

Alas you never know what your going to get until you can compare the two 
side by side.  
I managed to wrangle up an import CD single of times fly at Best Buy, go 
figure.  It's supposed to be as rare as hens teeth.

Yes it's still on XL (XL and Mute) and I'll agree with you on the old 
stuff.  Experience is one of my all time favorite albums and Poison is a 
definite floor hopper, Firestarter is a great track though, the edit 
that is on the single is a little 'iffy' but I love the vocals and the 
empirion mix is kickin.

(NOTE: this party is continuing on despite the fact that the artists booked
for the SOUR tour and the record company hosting the tour (COLUMBIA) had
financial differences regarding how much the artists were going to get
paid. the sunshine kids went ahead with the party with a revised lineup but
they still hope to provide you with a top nite out featuring some of the
best jungle sounds you'll hear in a wicked space that'll be booming with bass)

    Date: Thu, 13 Jun

    
    :::CHARM update:::
    
    CHARM is happening Saturday, June 15th, in Dayton, Ohio.  Directions to
    the space will be posted on the Illuminator voicemail line.  I'll try to
    get the directions posted here, also, but don't count on it.  The phone
    number for the voicemail line is 513.496.1071.  As of yesterday afternoon
    it was working.  If you leave a message, we probably won't get it until
    after the party.  Do not request to be on a guest list.  The doors open at
    10:00pm.  Admission is $5 at the door... no more, no less. 
    
    You will experience many styles of music throughout the night; you will
    not be bored.  The lineup for the main room is:
    SPINBOY...illumi-friend and weekend dj at the asylum (dayton)
    TAMARA PALMER...urb magazine editorgrrl (los angeles)
    LUSCIOUS DAN SMACK...simply the smack (columbia, missouri)
    MONOCHROME...elemental intellijungle gone detroit? (columbus)
    TODD SINES...elemental trakmaker (columbus)
    KEVY KEV...illumi-ele-friend whippin y'up into a frenzy (columbus)
    MARK GAGE...vapourspace live performance (rochester, ny)
    ALISON...bringing that california sunshine groove (los angeles)
    KELL...ky's finest goa and slo breaks (lexington)
    DIVINE...illumi-ele-justus friend welcoming the sunrise (dayton)
    
    The second room lineup is not firm, but it may at least include:
    JIMI...illuminator transcendance (dayton)
    CYLERT...brace yourself (st louis / dayton)
    ARASH...the illuminator-1 (dayton)
    DIVINE...deserves to spin sooner than last (dayton)
    
    As Arash posted, bring your own water.
    
    There are other things to do if you want to get here earlier in the day:
    
    Record shopping.  First I'll just tell you to go to Clubhead Records in
    Cincinnati -- get off on one of the downtown exits and get to Main St,
    which runs one-way to the north, on the eastern edge of the central city. 
    Clubhead is a couple miles up Main, on the right side.  Or World Record in
    Columbus -- I-70 to Rt 23 North (4th St), 4th St north several miles to
    15th Ave on left, 15th to High St., go right, look for public parking and
    walk the strip across from the OSU campus.  World Record is between
    McDonald's and Wendy's. 
    
    Dayton has not had a hip dance music shop since 1989-90, when Criminal
    Records was open.  (*gets teary eyed*)  If you are into hip-hop or old
    12"s and don't mind looking through thousands of used records, there is
    Omega Music, on N. Main in the Santa Clara arts district (a couple miles
    north of downtown.)  There are also a ton of 80s alternative, new wave,
    and pop dance records at Renaissance, on Smithville Rd across from
    AutoZone, just south of US 35, a few miles east of downtown.  On Brown St
    near the UD campus there are a few CD shops --Trader Vics, 2nd Time
    Around, and Gem City Records-- Take Main St south of downtown to Apple St
    (by the hospital) and turn left, take a right on Brown which is the next
    major intersection.  And in the Oregon District at the southeast corner of
    downtown there is a larger Gem City store, on 5th St near Patterson, just
    down the street from the White Tower, The New Neon Movies, and the
    Greyhound station. 
    
    College hangouts, coffee shops, galleries, etc: Brown Street, the Oregon
    District, and the Santa Clara district (directions above).  Also, the
    Village of Yellow Springs, 15 miles NE of downtown, is a popular spot --
    ultra liberal and a great place to bike, hike or shop.  I-70 to US 68
    south, or I- 675 to Dayton-Yellow Springs Rd east.  (email me for more
    specific directions; I live there) 
    
    All day on Saturday there will be a hispanic cultural festival going on at
    the Fraze Pavilion in Kettering, one of the suburbs south of downtown.  It
    is called the Festival Latino-Americana and will feature food, music,
    arts, dancing, puppet shows and entertainment.  It sounds pretty cool..
    and it's free.  At 7:30pm (or 8:30, depending on which announcement you
    read), there will be a $5 concert by Latin jazz conga master Poncho
    Sanchez and his combustive 11-piece band.  "come for a night of scorching
    salsa and dance-inducing mambo beat!"  Take Main St (aka Rt 48, Far Hills
    Ave) several miles south of downtown, past Dorothy Lane, to Lincoln Park
    Blvd on the left.  If you see Stroop Rd you went too far.  Lincoln Park
    Blvd will take you right to the pavilion.  Someone go to this thing and
    get Poncho Sanchez and his band to come to the party, okay? 
    
    The Dayton Museum of Natural History gives laser shows set to the Doors or
    Pink Floyd in their humongous planetarium on weekend nights;  you'll have
    to call them for directions.  (the number is in the book). 
    
    The Air Force Museum is open until 5pm during the day.  If you're into
    warplanes and rockets and the history of flight, it's something to do,
    it's big, and it's free.  I-675 to Col Glenn Hwy, go right (west) on Col
    Glenn, the museum is in the big hangars across the airfield to the right. 
    Go to the next major intersection (Harshmann) and go right; the entrance
    is about a quarter mile from there. 
    
    Sometimes they have bands playing in the middle of downtown on Courthouse
    Square.  Also downtown there is the Front St coffeehouse, on 1st Street
    (not Front). 
    
    Guess that's it for now.  See you at the party!
    
    Mike

On the contrary, I loved 'Jilted' one of the best dance albums of that 
year.  I only wish more artists in said genre could produce such 
consistant work.

>> -- pOtent perCussion vol.3  fri 14 jun columbus ohio

okay--snuggles and slak will not be attending due to an unfortunate family
situation on mike's part, but DJ CASPAR (julian carow) from boston/chicago
is here to take their place (in case you care)... 

also featured will be a live performance by aaron shinn as GHOST, playing 
the craziest experimental jungle you've ever heard.  photek who?
he's dragging out a lot of equipment to play for nothing, so please come 
out and give aaron some props!

there will also be dj sets by ATMAN and KINGsIZE, and another possible 
surprise guest...

the shindig'll start at about 12 midnight tonight, and will only cost a 
$1 donation which pays for julian's flight home to chicago ;)


directions:

the space is at ben/atman's house which is at the corner of 19th ave and 
summit st near the OSU campus.

from all points take 71 to the 17th ave exit and go west about 2 miles to 
N 4th ST.  take a RIGHT on n 4th, go up to 20th AVE, take a LEFT on 20th 
and go to SUMMIT ST, take another left, and find some parking.  dont park 
behind any apt buildings or anywhere dodgey coz they tow like a beeeatch 
around campus...

once you find the house please enter from the rear (we know you like it).

so that's it.  hope to see you there...

hello fellow net friends! This is Crisbee! Hossam and i have been talking 
to a bunch of you and since so many of you are thinking about coming 
here for Go Faster we thought we would have a pre-net meet! This meet 
will be about 15 minutes from the actual sight of the party! It is going 
to be right off the Monroeville Exit of the PA turn pike too!  The place is 
Chuck E.Cheese's!  Thats where I work and I thought it would be a great 
place for eveyone to meet and hang out before hand! There will be pizza 
and soda and *some* free tokens to play games and win prizes!  woo hoo! 
;) It wont cost more then like $5 or $6 each, either! I still have to 
talk to my manager to see if she'll give me a bigger discount! I think i can 
convince her! ;)
	I'm not quite sure what time everything is going to take 
place. The party starts at 10 so I thought like 8 to 11 or whenever you 
wanted to leave! The store closes at 11 so we all have to be gone by at 
least then!
	So thats our idea! All I need now is anyone who is thinking of 
coming to email me or hossam *privately*!!! As soon as possible! I would 
need to know if you are coming by at latest the 21st! So please get back 
to us as soon as you can! Trust me this will be lots of fun! Good food, 
unlimited drinks, games, prizes, and best of all friends!!  hahaha hope 
to hear from some of you soon! Also if you ahve any other ideas please 
say so!


much love
crisbee

(Tom, can you fwd this to Pb-Cle-Raves for me?  Thanks)

Here are the directions to

:::CHARM:::
10pm-sunrise
Dayton, Ohio
513.496.1071
Illuminator Mission X

The space is an old foundry in a warehouse complex north of downtown. 
This is the same complex where the Illuminators hosted Unknown Frequencies
featuring Carl Craig last year, and where The Hindenburg Co held Limited
Risk Venture.  However, this time a different building is being used.
There will be 2 rooms of sound.

Get to I-75.

from the North:
   Take I-75 south to exit 55: Keowee St.
   At the end of the ramp turn left onto Keowee St.
   Go through one light.  Turn left onto Chapel St, which is the
   first street after the light.  Turn left onto Keiser, and then
   right onto Ray, and then turn right into the fenced-in area.
   You will be instructed on where to park.

from the South:
   Take I-75 north to exit 55A: Keowee St.  
   At the end of the ramp turn right onto Keowee St.
   Go through one light.  Turn left onto Chapel St, which is the
   first street after the light.  Turn left onto Keiser, and then
   right onto Ray, and then turn right into the fenced-in area.

Admission is $5 at the door.  See you there!

Mike

          I would like to propose a question or two to the list.  This
          might be obvious to most, so I apologize for the clutter.
          Being fairly new to the "techno" music, the informatin I
          know about it is very small.  Due to work, family and school
          schedules I haven't been able to get to any "techno" music
          clubs or parties.  Would I would like to know is what the
          difference in all the types of "techno" music, so I maybe
          able to distinguish what types there are and what I like.
          Also, what are some suggestions of music to buy and where.
          The major music stores always have many "techno"
          compilations.  Are these just a waste of money or are some
          decent.

          If these questions are a waste of time, if someone would
          like to E-mail me privately, that would be appreciated.

          Thanking you in advance

first of all:  mark gage's live set was very moving.  after 2 earlier
attempts by the illuminators to get him to play live in dayton ended with
chaos on the one hand and eqiuipment failure on the other, the third time
did indeed prove to be the "charm."  very sensual melodies overlaid by 
very weird rhythms...dancey but somehow more mental and emotional in a 
way.  the kick was a little thin, leaving less to grab on to (my only 
complaint) but the strange arrangements really drew you into the music.  
it's like a european trance sensibility translated through the filters of 
detroit's experimental music...wouldnt mind getting ahold of any of his 
new material.  ok, one more minor complaint: he played his big HIT, 
"gravitational arch" which i'm still sick of...but everything else seemed 
totally new as far as i know.  yummy!

dj sets i can comment on:

allison - excellent house, tight mixing, good energy...uh, why arent more 
grrls doing this?

monochrome - after some false starts he finally got a spot in the second 
room and did a sloppy set of good jungle tunes (blame that system, 
partially ;), then proceeded to play a ripping set of _techno_ 
stuff...hardtraxx stuff, and really got the crowd moving.  by the end of 
charles' set he had almost as many people in the small room as there were 
in the main room.  yay!

that's pretty much the only djs i really can do justice to, sorry i spent 
most of my evening socializing and folding flyers.

last point:  i hear a lot of talk about the illuminators.  many people
feel that they are assholes or something, and that they dont want other
people to promote in dayton...etc, things like that.  far be it for me to
speak for them on this issue; i think they speak pretty clearly with their
events.  in case it isnt clear to you, then i will present my own
interpretation.  this was a $5 event.  over 1/2 the budget was LOST. 
money was lost, not _tons_, but it's all gone now.  the illuminators,
whether it be arash spearheading the event, or kourosh, or _whomever_, are
willing to put their own money on the line to throw an event they believe
in. 

i feel strongly about this, and that's part of the reason i support their
events and why i'm writing this now.  if anyone thinks they are rich
foreigners who dont really care about the scene, or that they are too
hardcore about their "anit-drug" stance or whatever, you're entitled to
your interpretation.  but _my_ interpretation, based solely on the quality
of their events, is that more often than not, they do it because they are
making a statement in support of a lot of good things:  good music from
locally or abroad, a relatively cheap price, a real sense of 
togetherness, responsible drug use, and a sense of consistency and 
integrity. 

promoters, if you're reading this, take a cue from the illuminators.  do
it for the right reasons.  you're not going to make any money doing
parties--in fact you're going to lose it.  you cant allow irresponsible
drug use--you'll get shut down.  you cant sell drugs to finance your
events for very long--you'll eventually hit a brick wall there (shadiness
begets shadiness).  you cant just thrown an event and then not pay
anyone--you'll get a class action suit slapped on your ass.  and so on. 

it's bigger than all of that...and it's obvious to me that ari and 
kourosh (and mike in this case) definitely have their finger on it.  
anyone who says otherwise just isnt listening.

that's _my_ interpretation.

I know a lot of you promoters out there have web pages or are planning on
having web pages at some point.  Err, like, send me the URL's and I'll put
the on the pb-cle homepage.  The homepage has been pretty pathetic really,
and since there's a lot of stuff going on around here, it's a good time to
make the page useful.

Also, if you ask me to link to something and you don't see it linked in a
while, *let me know*.  I get pretty busy, and email gets lost or forgotten
about in some cases.  Complain enough and it'll get linked.

Anyone have comments or suggestions about the page?  Does anyone actually
look at it?

PS: Today i updated the "upcoming events" section to have a link to Trout
Soup's Rave-o-matic and Pete Sysko's page.  URL for pb-cle-raves webspace
is:

	http://hyperreal.com/raves/pb-cle/

PPS: If you're promoting an event, put it in the GRID system.  All you
have to do is point your browser to http://hyperreal.com/raves/grid/ and
follow the instructions.  Likewise, if you're looking for something to do
somewhere, look at the GRID.  It's a pretty cool interface that has a
*lot* of stuff.

Sorry to be rude earlier, skinner, you said I spelled his name wrong; i
don't think i did....i know he doesn't work for/with you, but i know he
spins the same shit, that's what people wanto here. I hope i didn't
disrespect your label.....

        The main reason for this message to explain the bullshit going on
in the Northside. For those who attended busy past circa 4:30 am this past
saturday night, you know what i'm talking about.
Two piggy cars rolled up the street, got out, pick out the closest
"hooligan", started harassing him, and then stripped searched him. NO
warrant. NO probable cause. Then the cops asked for responsible person(s)
for the party. After talking with Rick for a minute, he agreed to make
everybody leave. I have a problem. As far as I know (someone correct me)
the law allows for a public gathering in a public place; the right to
assembly as long as your not bothering anyone.
The cops said they had a noise complaint. Fine. turn it down. right?
........wait not fine. Who the fuck lives anywhere remotely close the the
industrial zone in the Northside?!! I'll bet they didn't get one noise
complaint all night and for the past four or five weeks we've had those
parties.
        If you ask me, the cops started more trouble then they came to
stop. Everyone on exctasy  and acid, Ketamine, etc. that were forced to
drive out of there could have been a threat to the roads. The cops didn't
attempt to make judgement based on saftey and responsibility, like they
should.
        This folks, is bullshit.  Please please please mr officers let us
dance.......
I am more sad than mad. I wonder if Ortho will still be
there....please....I think I'm gonna cry ):

[flame suit on]
the judgement "based on saftey and responsibility" ulimately lies on the
driver of the car.  they'd have to drive home sooner or later, eh? some of
those drugs and hour or two wouldn't make much difference in driving
performance.  laters, trouty....

heres my short and nifty review of Get Busy ...

Got there @ like 4:30pm, parked, looked around, and decide we need to
get some playing cards. So I jetted out to the nearest 7-11, picked up
the cards
and came back ;) hehe ...

from like 6-8 or something i listened to the music and played cards ... 

went inside to hear db spin ... i espaichally digged the song wit' the 
sample from taxi driver "you looking @ me?". Like the set, but not enough
drum and bass for me ... wish he had spun longer / more or there was another
d&b dj. 

saw a rackoon ... that was cool ... it was eating nachos from Taco Bell,
found out racoons don't like pretzels (i offered it one and it didn't
take
it).

went back inside, saw crisbee (thanks for the blow pop ;) danced a bit,
chilled a bit ... left @ like 11pm and went to Eat & Park 

hehe .... I was exhastuted and my eyes hurt (don't know why) so I didn't 
get to the after party / busy. Also my friends had work to do the next
day ... (like summer school work).

peace
e munster

ps. I was having fun with my blow horn, whistle and lighter all night ...
if u turn a whistle upside down, fill it with gas and then light it ...
it burps ... hehe

i too had a really good time..:) (i'll have to get crisbee to introduce me
next time noah... but she was off in her own littlE world...;P)


i only wish i had gotten there earlier like around 4 while there was still
time to enjoy daylight and see ppl's faces...as it was i didnt get there
til 9 and didnt get to go on the trip i had been planning.

missed db's set but was there for all of what was unanimously the best set
of the nite...tim's.  he spun a wicked trance set that had ppl yelling and
cheering and clapping which was pretty cool inside of a old wooden lodge
straight out of yogi bear :)

after him was sine who also spun a really great trance set with a big
emphasis on big breakdowns full of breakbeats...he even spun the old scott
henry classic track that usually makes kids cry and hug each other.. viva
house by me and jack ...:)

so the cops came and shut it down around 11:30 one song before the end of
andy's set.. he was pretty mad too coz he was just about to throw his last
record (true faith by new order) when he was told to turn it off...
midnight was when we had to be off the park grounds, not when the party
ended...oh well...




the afterparty that i assume stickman threw was a fucking mess... first off
i have to say theres too much disorganization at these things (and yes im
gonna bitch.. fuck you :P) i went to the first one ("suck") and me and
josh/opus had to drive back to his place in east liberty to get gear that
rick/stickman forgot...one thing that he didnt have that first party was a
power strip....one of the things that was holding shit up on sat nite was
that they didnt have a power strip.. hey rick, why not take that $5 i gave
you at the first party and go buy a fucking power strip form wal-mart for
$4.99? you can keep the change..

i understand there was some problem with the soundsytem and obtaining it
from joe totten (raver joe)...but jeez guys when u are *setting up* an
afterhours.. that means u have it ready when the first party is over....that
means u leave the first party well before it ends so u have time to get
everything ready...whatever.. i know its a free deal and all and i cant
fault rick for his enthusiasm and dont give me the if you want to do it
better then do it yourself line.. coz i have. and i know it can be done
better.. but hey its a free party and we should be patient? whatever...this
is constructive criticism meant to improve the quality of the future free
renegades that are done...leave an hour early, have the gear all ready, if
you dont have it one time, make sure you have it the next...simple enuff.


on to the next thing that was much much worse... some idiot kids show up
with a tank of nitrous.. that in and of itself isnt bad.. i dont want to be
a hypocrite..;) but the way they were behaving was an embarASSment to
themselves at best, a danger to the whole party at worst.. they were all
hooting and hollering and carrying on and acting like the stupid jerks that
they were...

not only are they drawing mad attention to themselves (very uncool when you
have a TANK of an illegal substance) but this one girl (who i think was
with them) took a hit...passed out...SLAMMED her head on the hard asphalt
from a standing position (shes lucky she didnt hit a sharp rock or a nail
or some glass) her neck snapped back, and then she was lying there
unconcious, all fishing out (having a  seizure from lack of oxygen to the
brain) and what did the guys do? did they help her up and see if she was
all right? no they resumed their hooting and hollering like the drunken
hillbilly yinzers from west virginia that they probably were and proclaimed
"WE GOT THE BOMB SHIT!! AWW YEAH WE GOT THE BOMB!" that made me sick.. but
what reall was sad was the girl recovered, smiled and began dancing around
and yelling and cavorting around with these very same ppl...god i hope that
fucking bitch STILL Has a headache. it'll serve her right.

and if any of you ppl just *happen* to be on this list or hear about me
saying this here...

yes ill still fucking say this to your face coz u are an irresonsible bunch
of fucks who are a discredit to the 'scene' (whichever one that may be, but
i sure as hell know you're not part of my scene)...so again, fuck you.


*ok then* ;)

well, i'll see you all at go faster! and dont worry i wont punch you in the
face (probably) :)

*love and kissies all around*

peace,
hossam aka m.c. care bear :P

Hey all...

I just wanted to log in and say that I saw the space for Electric Kingdom
that's happening this Friday, and the spot is gonna be nice.  Besides the
great Jungle and breakbeat that you can hear, there will be an utter
overload of visual information that should definitely keep you
entertainted.  The line-up includes three video projectors live mixed with
tape and live camera footage, two film projectors looped and mixed, a
shitload of TV's and slides, IRC and Vrave terminals, networked video
games on three workstations (Doom, Rise of the Triad, Duke Nukem 3D etc.),
graphiti on canvas by local artists (pre-painted, not in the space, we
don't want another problem with inhalants), more local visual art
installations, ...  and who knows what else I forgot. 

All I gotta say is that for 10 bucks there will be plenty to do in a new 
space with some nice DJs and video artists *from out of town* so all of 
you who moaned about no new talent or out-of-town acts coming to 
Pittsburgh can get your fill.  

***BTW, a net meet will be at 1:00am in the front (dub and breaks) room by
the computer terminals, seems like a good place to do it, eh?*** 

later,
Toby

P.S. If you were at the Final Comedown last year ... you know the score.

This number is not right!!! It used to be (about a year and a half ago).
Our new number is 410.347.1402.

Any promoters can use our line for Baltimore promotion--- as long as you 
get in touch with us first.

I've taken up enough of everyone's valuable time now-- so back to your 
regularly scheduled lives <now in progress>.

                 The Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave-0-Matic mkII
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
-=<O>=-------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

Fri Jun 28               GO FASTER preparty netmeet            Pittsburgh

hello fellow net friends! This is Crisbee! Hossam and i have been talking 
to a bunch of you and since so many of you are thinking about coming 
here for Go Faster we thought we would have a pre-net meet! This meet 
will be about 15 minutes from the actual sight of the party! It is going 
to be right off the Monroeville Exit of the PA turn pike too!  The place 
is Chuck E.Cheese's!  Thats where I work and I thought it would be a great 
place for eveyone to meet and hang out before hand! There will be pizza 
and soda and *some* free tokens to play games and win prizes!  woo hoo! 
;) It wont cost more then like $5 or $6 each, either! I still have to 
talk to my manager to see if she'll give me a bigger discount! I think i 
can convince her! ;)
	I'm not quite sure what time everything is going to take 
place. The party starts at 10 so I thought like 8 to 11 or whenever you 
wanted to leave! The store closes at 11 so we all have to be gone by at 
least then!
	So thats our idea! All I need now is anyone who is thinking of 
coming to email me or hossam *privately*!!! As soon as possible! I would 
need to know if you are coming by at latest the 21st! So please get back 
to us as soon as you can! Trust me this will be lots of fun! Good food, 
unlimited drinks, games, prizes, and best of all friends!!  hahaha hope 
to hear from some of you soon! Also if you ahve any other ideas please 
say so!

much love
crisbee

F A N T A S I A   I I

in the beginning house was a feeling, and from this feeling came the music.
the music came together to create the atomosphere and then the summer of 
love.
but the people grew disillusioned and became divided. different forms of 
music
were created and a new generation of ravers were born. techno was the new
feeling. and from techno emerged music that incorporated sounds of a new era.
the music was more than just a feeling, it was a way of life. intelligent
music for intelligent minds. detrimental drums and bassline. music for the
future. so as the beats and the bass thunder down, we bring forth the knights
of the underground.

The Attic in Millvale has a fairly nice selection of dancehall stuff, 
with some trance, and loads o' InSoc (yeah!).  They have a fairly nice 
collection of twelves, and you can test-spin stuff if you're almost ready 
to buy it.

CHARM - the illuminators - 6/15/96 - dayton, ohio
-------------------------------------------------

(standard disclaimer: if u are unfamiliar w/ the typical stevie t 
 review they tend to be long & often run off topic. so as with becky
 i must warn u to read @ yur own risk. oh btw becky, gotta give u
 props, u may think yur reviews may be bandwidth wasting, but they
 shows just how much positivity u eminate not only in the way u
 write but in the amount of pure energy u add to the scene by helping
 the promotors w/ their events. keep up the vibe & don't let the negative 
 fuks get to yah!)

ok being the opinionated motherf*cker i am, i wanna start by 
commenting on some previous reviews of the party before i get into
my own...

ed sed:
====================================================================
first of all:  mark gage's live set was very moving.  after 2 earlier
attempts by the illuminators to get him to play live in dayton ended with
chaos on the one hand and eqiuipment failure on the other, the third time
did indeed prove to be the "charm."  very sensual melodies overlaid by 
very weird rhythms...dancey but somehow more mental and emotional in a 
way.  the kick was a little thin, leaving less to grab on to (my only 
complaint) but the strange arrangements really drew you into the music.  
it's like a european trance sensibility translated through the filters of 
detroit's experimental music...wouldnt mind getting ahold of any of his 
new material.  ok, one more minor complaint: he played his big HIT, 
"gravitational arch" which i'm still sick of...but everything else seemed 
totally new as far as i know.  yummy!
======================================================================

1st off it's "gravitational arch of 10", 2nd off i dunno what yur talking
about ed cuz his new rendition of the song was phenominal & it did not even
closely resemble the original version he put out in '93. in fact it was
even completely different from the version he played in syracuse @ Mars
about two months ago. i personally loved his new remix of it. my only
downer was forgetting to show him the pic i snapped of him @ Mars after
shaking his hand & commenting on how an amazing producer he wuz. that's
another thing i don't think kids knew just how lucky they were cuz Mark's
set @ Charm wuz about twice as long as it wuz @ Mars plus u only had to 
pay a mere five bones instead of the twenty five to get into Mars (but 
then again i didn't hafta to pay to get into either party). oh one more
thing, mark may be signed to Plus 8, a detroit lable, but he's from rochester,
new york (ack! sacreligious! who brought such an evil east coaster to our
holy parts!).

========================================================================
monochrome - after some false starts he finally got a spot in the second 
room and did a sloppy set of good jungle tunes (blame that system, 
partially ;), then proceeded to play a ripping set of _techno_ 
stuff...hardtraxx stuff, and really got the crowd moving.  by the end of 
charles' set he had almost as many people in the small room as there were 
in the main room.  yay!
=========================================================================

of course being the sh*t head i am, i missed out on it! the ironic part
wuz i had told charles how nice he looked in his shirt & tie (hmmm could
star or myself inspired this?) & how he wuz "all dressed up & had no place 
to go" before he found out that he would be spinning after all. my only 
consolation wuz meeting his totally rad mom. yup mama monochrome gets my 
vote for kewlest rave parent (the title wuz previously held by lonnie's dad 
who participated in the break dance circle at one of his ultraworld partys).
but rumor has it that ed's mom plans on stealing this title when she will
become the newest member of GAGA this friday (and u thought ed looked kewl
in his tights), tee hee, stevie's joke gimmick to get kids to come out to
ACTIVE NOT PASSIVE =)

============================================================================
last point:  i hear a lot of talk about the illuminators.  many people
feel that they are assholes or something, and that they dont want other
people to promote in dayton...etc, things like that.  far be it for me to
speak for them on this issue; i think they speak pretty clearly with their
events.  in case it isnt clear to you, then i will present my own
interpretation.  this was a $5 event.  over 1/2 the budget was LOST. 
money was lost, not _tons_, but it's all gone now.  the illuminators,
whether it be arash spearheading the event, or kourosh, or _whomever_, are
=============================================================================

this wuz actually my 1st illuminator event. yup five years in the scene,
one of the founding fathers in the northern ohio rave scene & never even been
to an illuminator event! and judging from this party, i would be more than happy
in helping promo any future illuminator events (as long as they don't piss on
any of the cleveland or akron flyers i bring down). the ironic part is the 
whole time i wuz there i wuz hoping to see of all people - thome tomato. i had
a surprise meeting w/ him @ FA, but haven't seen him since. i know alot of kids
down south hate his guts. but y'gotta admit the guy did get the southern ohio
scene going. and in light of all the shit talk surrounding the illuminators,
one would finally see all the BS all promotors have to go thru. and as bad as
mr. Tomato wuz i still think alot of it wuz just that - shit talk. and i know
for a fact that Thome did care about his kids cuz when Amy aka Dj Siren from
Dayton couldn't get her car started after one of his partys. Thome paid for her
tow truck. and this is exactly why i don't believe most of the shit talk
surrounding Joel aka Deadly Buddah, founding father of the pittsburgh rave 
scene. i think kids of today are just finding out about the shit u have to
deal w/ for throwing partys. ok enuff old skool ramblings...

becky sed:
===============================================================================
  When we got back, Arash put us to work moving a few barrels and skids 
around to block a couple areas off, and help set up the tables in the 
main room.. eeewww that was DIRTY!!! But kinda fun... I didn't even 
realize I had a big black smudge on my nose, and black crap all over my 
butt until becca started beating my ass (or was it Katerina?) Then, 
BEcca, Karla, and everyone at the site decided to go off and shower/clean 
up before coming back to the party.. WE followed Sean and Debbie, the 
Smart BAr guys to the hotel (mad props to them for use of their shower) 
and waited for like 40 minutes for towels.... But, we got showers, and 
================================================================================

gotta give props the space wuz doop! old skool warehouse w/ just enuff dirt
to give yur rave boogers that special color that u know & luv! after sitting
on the ground christa had to beat her ass too. the stain remained & i nicknamed
her "poopy pants". 

yup, mr. rose not only supplies us w/ the best in liquid refreshment, but the
latest in detroit happenings. this wuz why me & christa wuz a li'l out of it @
the end, she just found out some disturbing news concerning her best friend in
detroit & there wuz nothing she could do to help.

allyson sed:
===============================================================================
Okay as for the music in the main room.  The first thing I want to say: to
those people who left before DJ Alison spun...I am soooo sorry...you pretty
much missed the whole point of that party.  HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE
CENTURY>>>she rocked my world..and a half.  She was ALL that and a bag of
chips...including the salsa.  Ya dig?  This girl brought that incredible west
coast flava into the house and completely hypnotized everyone with the great
vibe and energy she released through her set.  It was amazing and anyone who 
===============================================================================

ok guilty as charged i did miss part of Alison's opening set cuz christa had 
to pee. but i'll hafta admit the 1st coupla of records wuz the stuff i wuz
waiting for all night - west coast beats that squeezed the dance outta yah.
unfortunately after we got back & due to all the disturbing news christa had
just found out we couldn't enjoy ourselves too much. but i will give props,
i thought alison stole the set of the night. other surprises wuz kevy kev
that spun some old skool hi-nrg muzik & kell that spun the trance that did 
exactly that - put me in a trance. i found myself standing by myself catatonic
absorbing all the mesmerizing grooves. i think near the end both christa & i
were too dead to move very much (perhaps i should've taken those mini-thins
u offered me, trouty) since we both had gotten up early that morning to work
and i had driven almost five hours that day, so we retired in my car & took
a much needed nap. 

kell sed:
==============================================================================
Back to Dancing... When a person starts going to parties, they are kinda
looking around and watching other people dance (especially if dancing isn't
something they have done a lot of in the past) and they kinda imitate and
learn.  They are aclimating to the environment.  So they do the moves... I
always hear people saying how some person who just started going to parties
is stealing all their moves ;)  (yeah, I'm smiling)  I'd like to point out
real quick, in case you seem to remember those words coming out of your
mouth, that... "imitation is the greatest form of flattery" :)
===============================================================================

i wish i could quote more of this since it wuz all so eloquent & so, so, so
right on. as a past "dancer" (now just an old foggy that can barely move), i
found yur interpretation quite unequivocal. many times i go out, i find myself
watching the new dancers. it is a bit flattering to see yur moves imitated 
but nothing beats seeing yur move taken to a whole new realm. that is when 
u know yur dancing has evolved. and when u take their interpretation and 
expand it that much further. the process has come full circle. i wish i could
take the time to trace dancing to some of its ancestors from the break dance
moves of frosty freeze, the founder of rock steady crew - new york, from the
vogue dancers of the gay black house clubs of chicago and new york, to the
rave dancers that inspired me: lisa lee, kurt perry, suzy q, colleen, alex,
ross, bobby, yoshi, leidra, etc. we have all inspired each other and it is quite
evident in our dance. there is a whole lineage of rave dancers that have 
followed the progress of the music. it is an underground tradition that has
survived for quite some time and continues to grow but seldom is it brought
into the light becuz dancers tend to express themselves better through their
bodily movements than their words. u'll just hafta seek the dancers to see
what they have to say thru their dance...

ok i'll guess i've wasted enuff bandwidth commenting about the past reviews
of the party so i'll just give a list of plusses on stuff i haven't covered
already...

+ driving my new rental ford conture w/ cruise control (which totally helped
  out on the long drive from 1st cleveland to columbus & then columbus to 
  dayton) - the replacement car for my honda civic that got rear ended & is
  in the shop - gotta luv full coverage when it's not yur fault in car 
  accidents!

+ introducing ben (dj atman) from columbus to ben (cylert) from dayton. it
  wuz funny cuz when we went to pick up ben he actually wuz still in his boxers
  cuz he had just had that party in his apartment last night & had just gotten
  up. we tried to get his girl jenn to come out but after losing her lunch
  on the couch the night before from all her drinking she wuzn't up to it.

+ not having to pass out all those FA 2 flyers cuz some one had already 
  brought some down. Brian wuz also happy he didn't hafta go out to indy
  cuz i got michael to pass'em out for him there too. don't worry michael
  i made sure to tell Brian to guest list yah. UPS is up on familiar rave
  promotor traditions & they've never let me down in the past.

+ practicing my southern accent w/ christa, since she's from dayton & complained
  about all the prejudiced red necks there. and then later practicing my chinese
  accent, when i got worried the red neck ravers would beat me up when they
  heard me 'fronting' to be a hick.

+ seeing mark, joe, angel, & april from cleveland dancing their bootys
  off. the new generation of dancers is looking good. i wuz kinda surprised
  to see'em cuz i had mentioned the party to 'em @ the Church on sunday, but
  never expected for them to show up. same goes w/ jeff & mary from cleveland,
  i thought jeff had to work & surprise there he wuz! see Leah, u could've
  made it out too!

+ afterparty breakfast @ Bob Evans w/ ben, sara, phil & MC Jones (who will also
  be spinning this friday @ ACTIVE NOT PASSIVE (plug, plug) - not to be confused
  w/ ed jones on this list). and driving around in circles @ the after after
  party breakfast @ McDonalds in dayton (McD's doesn't open 'til 7am so we drove
  around in circles in the parking lot 'til it did - it seemed to confuse quite
  a few of the early daytonites tho).


two minor minuses:

- not meeting all u netters that wuz @ the party - cuz i wuz so out of it. it's 

  strange coming from a scene where everybody & their mother knows u & coming to
  a city where every face is unfamiliar.

- that one kid that od'ed & had to be carted away w/ four guys holding each
  limb. it ain't a party 'til some kid flips out. but i wish kids would learn
  already.

Hey kids this was sent to me from a girl from my neck of the woods wanting
real time info on the where and how of Family Affair... Since those riff
raff guys don't return my calls (or even have a phone right now) I thought
some one out there might have better info???  Anyway, send her line if you
can help her out.

dial the right number? riff raff # is 330.376.1644, ask for brian or lee.

updates:

* everything is go
* if u went to last years Family Affair, u've already been to the site.
  just ask anybody w/ a clue that went last year & they'll tell yah 
  where it wuz at. it's in a big campground in canton, ohio. not cleveland.
* flyers were put out  last weekend by myself in dayton, michael
  in indy, brian in detroit, and lee in chicago (btw chicago wuz the only
   city where kids had a problem w/ the flyers, hmmm, could this be due to V?)
* if u have any other questions u can e-mail me (stevie t) @ syt@po.cwru.edu
  or u can call brian or lee directly @ 330.376.1644 during regular store
  hours.

i thought kate, our very own softcore geek girl had already typed out the
flyer, but here it is again in case u missed it...

That kid who od'ed or whatever.. He was on K.. I was one of the "guys" 
who grabbed a leg on the way to my car to take a nap.. 

 *goes on her sXe kick* I'm sorry guys, but what i saw on SAt nite with 
that kid really scared me. He was in a "K-Hole".. Totally unaware of 
everything that was going on.. he looked like he was unconscious with his 
eyes open... it was really creepy...

 Please guys, make sure that if you're going to do drugs that you know 
your limits, and don't go beyond them.. and even if you know and stay 
within your limits, always always make sure you ahve a sober friend to 
watch after you, and make sure you're okay.. AND.. try to make sure you 
have a sober back-up ride home from parties... I don't want anyone else I 
know to get themselves dead.... I love you all way too much...

 Know yourself, know your limits, and stay within them, is all I ask...

 *gets off the mother kick now*

have a good one! I leave in 6 days!!

-Becky =)

Watch it there... I think your statements are beginning to become a wee
bit to harsh, and might I add, naive. 

This is what I am annoyed with in the scene (among other things)... yes,
it is fine and dandy for a person to have pride in their scene, so be it,
and I admit, Ultraworld does have their shit together when it comes to
throwing large, massively publicized parties.  And, ironically, their shit
just about always goes down without any snags.  Lonnie has experience with
promotions, and it shows.  Point taken.

However, let's also consider that not every party that is out there is
thrown with a five to six figure budget (or an apparent budget, according
to promoters).  Yes, Liberty may have 'sucked' according to public
opinion.  Yes, Local 13's little slice of 'Happiness' seemed more like
Hell on earth in reality.  That's shoddy promotion and organization, and
pardon me for saying this, but this has been going on ever since I got
involved in the scene back in '92, and time is seeming to prove that
things are not going to change.

SOME PEOPLE PUT SOUL AND EFFORT INTO THEIR PARTIES, and SOME DON'T.  

But I take offense (as a former promoter myself and on behalf of other
promoters that I know) when you state that you wouldn't have "ANY" desire
at all to attend any party other than an Ultraworld party.  I'd say you're
denying yourself a whole lot.

Pittsburgh is working.  Yes, things are getting more expensive (but hell,
it seems to be a trend now...)  As of the coming Monday one year ago,
UnDerGround Productions threw a moderately priced party in a CITY AUTO
TUNNEL without any glitches.  (Ironically, it was also on my Birthday,
which was an added bonus.)  Right now, the Sunshine Kids, the Lollipop
Possee and UnDerGround are still continuing to deliver safe, bust-free
events with wonderful lineups...  And did I mention the weekly/semi-weekly
FREE renegade parties that go down in the city proper?  Much vibe there..
412 represent.. :)

NEW is working (that's New England Works, a NH outfit)...   Columns of
Knowledge in Connecticut is working.  KC and the Sunrise Gang in Maine are
working. Transfused is working.  These are a few of the many groups out
there that are throwingmore or less hassle-free events, however it is rare that they are ever
propped.  Baltimore this, and NYC that.  There is a ton more out there  
to explore, and it's all there for the taking.

Yes, the scene has been flooded with promoters everywhere over the years.
Some have their business down, and yes, I agree, a lot of them don't.  But
that's how the proverbial cookie crumbles, mate.  In the words of De La,
"everyone wants to be a (promoter/DJ)"...

So let's not be so hasty to rationalize next time.  Not everyone out there
is out to rip you off, or cheat you.

What cities?  What promoters?  We all know the "glossy, full-page foldout"
ones...

the 2nd room used to be a place where you could hear different kinds of 
music...where you could relax _or_ dance if you wanted to.  but that kind 
of 2nd room has been dead in the mw for some time now.  it's all about 
the driving beats now...while more atmospheric/mental music is scarcely 
even heard at events anymore.

there's a lot of reasons for this.  for example, slower, ambient, chill,
acid-jazz, trip-hop, and experimental stuff is often described as "boring"
music...having no drive, no real "kick."  i say they're wrong...you just
have to work to find the groove.  it's not passive music, it just asks you
to interact with it in deeper ways, that's all. 

but another reason for the death of the kind of 2nd room i'm talking about
is because of the new proliferation of the "dance music" dj.  everyone and
their brother wants to be in the spotlight and match beats now.  everybody
wants to prove they can spin and play the stuff with the driving beats. 
what better place to take over than to kick those "ambient" djs off
the tables in the second room...coz after all, they can't _really_ spin
can they? 

wrong.  many of them can, and most of that music has beats anyway but no 
one gives these djs props because they're not trying to get people to 
dance like maniacs, they just want people to groove real nice and gradual to 
their music.  and even when there's no beats at all, it takes a lot of 
effort to create an atmospheric set that flows, yet these djs get even 
_less_ recognition.

the point is, i miss having this kind of room ("chill-out" is what they
used to call it).  i miss being able to have a place where you can rest
your mind, where your soul and body can be soothed or taken on a mental or
physical journey without necessarily pushing you along with hard, boomin
beats.  i like to be lulled along by softer rhythms sometimes (like miles
maeda and mark farina)...i think you all know what i mean.   i think many 
of you would agree, even.

so anyway, i'm doing something about it.  this friday i've designed an
event which is supposed to sort of feel like a chill-out room but is also
meant for dancing.  an "atmospheric" event (for lack of a better term). an
event designed to prove that so-called "passive" music is not passive at
all, but very "active" indeed. 

and in these times of huge, mindblowing, $20 events almost every weekend,
this is a $4 event meant for the mind _and_ body...a chance to purify
yourself & take a breather.  a chance to participate on many levels, to be
an active participant, not just a passive spectator (hence the name)... 

if you're into this, let me know (even if you cant make it).  i need all
the encouragement i can get.  if i feel like it's worth it, i'll keep
trying to get this sort of thing together.  in other words, ARE YA WITH
ME?!?! 

oh yah...if you _are_ coming, bring soft stuff (cushions, pillows, 
blankets, etc... :)

in response to the little exchange between William Arthu Werde and Hannibal -
i have to quickly add my two cents.

i think a party is what you make of it.  There seems to be so much bashing of
other scenes, promoters, vibes... etc.. goin on in the net - thats not a bad
thing, nothing would ever improve if people weren't critical - but i
personally think we just need to remember why we go to raves.  We go to have
fun.  We go to enjoy great music, entertainment, smiling faces, a wonderful
vibe... i could go on... but my point is - instead of simply sayin'  certain
production groups just produce shitty parties - maybe it is the attitude
created by labeling that group as shitty producers, that makes the party
suffer. 

to get down to the specifics that triggered me - i believe it was Hannibal
who said "Yes, Local 13's little slice of 'Happiness' seemed more like Hell
on earth in reality." Welp.  I went to happiness. I went with all sorts of
skepticism because i had heard so much crap about the philly scene.  I also
went with so much apprehension and excitement that on the hour long drive in
between philly and allentown - i thought i was going to pop.  I had a
WONDERFUL time.  i could go on forever about how much i luved it. I thought
happiness was a great party.  Sure it had plently of weaknesses - but at the
time i could care less - i had fun and thats all that mattered to me.  But i
know that what made it so fun for me was the fact that i was totally open to
absorb everything about a scene i had never been to - in a completely
un-judgmental way.  

so thats my two cents.  

lots of luv
leah

Yes, I must admit also that this is really pathetic.

HELL, he's already collecting royalties from the CDS that he sells in MY 
(regular) RECORD STORE!!!

He should be able to find gigs on his own by now...

Greetings all - 
  I just found out that I'll be one of the music directors for WDSR, 
97.7 Dusquesne College radio.  No we're not WDUQ, we're their weaker 
little brother, but unlike WDUQ, it's all student programming all the time.

Basically, the station is very dance/techno/breaks/etc. poor, so I'm 
going to try to pump up their collection.  While I'm sure most 
techno/dance labels are too poor to be giving out radio promos, I'm just 
wondering if anybody knows contact info on any that can give out 
promos.  Overall it looks good for techno/dance on WDSR this year because the
music directors consist of a hip-hop DJ who also likes club music, my 
friend who likes all kinds of techno, and myself.

Or, if anyone has their own projects and wants possbile college airplay
(if you send them in care of Steve Bruder or Geoff Maddock, they WILL get 
played at least once), just send stuff to:

    MUSIC DIRECTOR 
    WDSR
    Dusquesne University
    SMC 2500
    1345 Vickroy Street
    Pittsburgh PA 15219

Hopefully the signal will be boosted this year so we can broadcast to ALL 
of the hill district.

Thanks,
  Geoff Maddock

Hardware is an excellent DJ that plays a huge variety of music, yet still
does not get booked up in Central Florida b/c of the Orlando arrongance
towards DJs from the South.  He is also a very kind person.  I don't think
he deserves any of the negative vibes you people have been posting about
him.



PLUR,

I have two seats in my car for anyone interested in going to the wacky
nutty ambient jammy jam called active not passive in Columbus OH
friday night.  I'm spinning, so my guests will be, well, guest listed.
Wanna go!? :) I'd love to have some people come with me.  Please email
me here or at GLAZERS@WESTOL.COM sometime friday before 1 pm, or call
836-1167 and either talk to me early morning or leave a message.  :)
OK, later -Count Zer0 (Frank)

	Ok, so the deal is, all the peeps that were going with me to 
Columbus tonight bailed due to work.  ACK! This means I have to drive 
like 5 hours (maybe less i guess) BY MYSELF.  That is, of course, unless 
one of you happy happy people want to come with me.  I know you do! :)  
Just think, a night of grooovy smooth tunes in another state! Sounds like 
fun doesn't it!?  And what will it cost ya? Nothin if ya come with me.  
'Cept you'll have to listen to me whine about how bad a dj i am and stuff... :) 
But other than that it'll be a hootin hollerin' good time. (Well, 
actually, considering the ambience of the event i'm not sure there'll be 
much hootin and hollerin...)  but anyway, come with me ok?  :) I have 
room now for 3 people.  And if just one person replies, then we might 
just be heading to SUNRISE FESTIVAL tomorrow too!  But thats all up in 
the air yet too... So get ready for adventure... email me back NOW or 
call me at 8361167   ok?  :) sounds GREAT! -Count Zer0

I agree w/ Pedro concerning his skills and also about the nice guy thing.....
And I must also say that Hardware has been a friend of mine for many many
years..

NOW

Like most people on the Net I just get tired of the same old looking for
Bookings E-mail sent to us and others.... I am also a DJ but I don't keep on
asking about bookings....
Hardware has many CD's out It really does not look good for him to keep on
asking about gigs.....
There are other ways to go about it.

I give you much respect for recognizing there is incredible music beyond
dance music. I would love to go to your event, but I made promises to go to
Electric Kingdom in Pittburgh. I am not a DJ or a promoter, but I make
ambient/trance/experimental/and yes even hardcore with my mac/midi setup.
When I lays tracks down and play them to people, some are disappointed
(Although they don't tell me) there are not enough fast changes. Fast
changes are what makes people dance.  When I attempt to make dance music,
it sounds too much like a foreign night club act.. ..reeeeallll cheezy.
Perhaps thats because I don't own a sampler yet. (NOt for long!!)
        My best pieces are very minimumalist (sp?) and start off ambient.
By the end of the song you will be lulled to a pulsating rhythm that does
not neccisarily make you dance, but stimulates very actively the mind, not
so much the body.  The stuff they spin on the dance floor actively effect
the body (as long as you let it) and then what you body is doing stimulates
your mind.
        These two methods of mind stimulation both work, but one cannot
expect everybody to use one method over the other for 10 hours straight. At
raves with no chill room I sometimes get bored musically.When I'm done
dancing for the moment, nothing to do but sit in a corner and watch people
dance, go outside and watch people do drugs.....Seems to occupy the time
yet it would be so much cooler with rooms with the atmosphere you are
trying to create.
I DEEM THEE MAD PROPS, ELUNA

That's cool - we need more producers that are willing to explore all 
different styles/aspects of music.  I'd like to hear some of your stuff.

  I gotta say, your right, at least for me, quick changes / buildups 
/ breakdowns get me to dance, but that doesn't mean I don't like 
ambient/soft building stuff too.  Really, anything out of the ordinary is 
welcome in my book.  Of course, you have to know most ravers are going to 
want to dance first, ask questions later.

> Perhaps thats because I don't own a sampler yet. (NOt for long!!)

Have you ever checked out 'MODs'?  They're musical tracks that you can 
make on a regular PC/amiga/mac with just a sound card.  Loadss of programs 
to make them are freeware/shareware, and there are literally THOUSANDS 
of freeware tracks out there.  Plus, you can use about any digital audeo 
format as a sample - like .wav, .sam, .au, etc...  I can tell you more 
about this stuff if you want...

Yes!  I have this problem too - whenever I'm tired of dancing for a 
while, I end up sitting or wandering around, especially at one-room type 
events.  Raves with many aspects/rooms things to do would be great - it 
sounds like that's what Electric Kindgom's trying to do with video 
displays, games, etc....

just some thoughts,

If you're looking to mail order a couple of 12's, Industrial Sound and 
Lighting has them, marks 2&3.  The only problem is, they've got that 
little request for Kibo cashola for them.  You might get lucky and find 
someone selling one used.  Myself, I use an Optimus Lab 1k 'table 
(definitly not the best, but it suits me..  homebrew), and have no 
problems with it.

I remember talking to you about having an events site for pb-cle area. I
did't know you lived in squirrel hill.(SO do I)  If I got this message B4
EK, I would have definately given you a ride.  Sorry I've been slacking on
my web site; I just have no time.
        I Think we should keep in touch because my friend Rick Stickman
mentioned that you might be able to maybe press a couple tracks of mine
sometime. I have no final product this moment because I don't have the
equipment (I have been using the OPSM system [Other Peoples Sound
Modules]), but what I've played to DJ"s they asked where the fuck they can
get it on vinyl. I don't mean to brag, but I think maybe sometime n the
future we could have a collaboration.
        Catchya later.

        Sorry everybody if you get a message from me that was not supposed
to be directed to you, I fucked up.
        Anyway I like to share some of my thoughts about EK, and relate
them to our discussions about chill rooms.
    Electric Kingdom's space had the potential to be really phat. Some
positives were:
        -cool projections image thinggys, a little on the weird side, so
thats cool.
        -no blantant drug transactions in the bathroom, although I'm sure
there were
        -two nice and loud rooms, so you could pick your poison
        -coolly cool computer terminals (did anyone find eacth other at the
net meet? I didn't)
   Alright here comes my bitchin'
        -What the fuck was that chair on wheels doing right in the middle
of the dance floor?
        -I like hip hop, but I was not in the mood for it and the other
room at that time had no music.
        -Omar didn't get to play (or did he?)
        -There was a period of about twenty minutes in which there was no
music coming from either rooms; which probably contributed to the amounts
of people hanging out on the street; which directly affected the fact that
the cops came....
        **THERE WAS NO PLACE TO GO BUT OUTSIDE TO CHILL**

I'm not blaming the producer/promoter, but there are somethings thast can
be done to prevent people from hanging outside. In nEw York they lock you
in.  That is why it was busted in 1:15 am, because no one took
responsibility for the 50-60 kids hanging outside....

Bye all;;;;;;


p.s. Ortho is adding a chill "dock" for your listening pleasure. I think
Count Zero is playing.

Hey.  a bunch of 2 cents on Electric Kingdom...

I really respect what tea and the other folks set up at EK, and also @ 
The Final Comedown.  Crazy visuals, 2 rooms, neat spaces, little 
amenities like a pile of copied yearbook pictures and room to write 
comments...there were some funny ones.  

Basically, I don't think it was a "rave", but it was one hell of a 
creative party.  If you were into it, it was hard to get bored.  Always 
something new to look at or listen to.  And the crowd was really nice and 
varied.  Not jsut the same old people.

Dimented Wordsmiff and Oyo were real cool, as were the computers, and the 
variety of music I heard in the short time I was there.  adair's set was 
too experimental and disjointed to get me really moving, but the ideas 
were good.  Farmer Tea's set started blowing up just as the cops rolled in.

if it had lasted longer, it would have been well worth the 10 bucks.  but 
cops were swarming all over the city last night and some bad decisions 
were made.

One, WHAT THE **FUCK** was Iron Fucking City beer doing at a party????  
Any alcohol for that matter?  The doors should have been supervised 
better and motherfuckers should have been more responsible about what 
they were bringing into the space.  That really pisses me off.  Not that 
the cops wouldn't have found another excuse.

Which brings me to my next point.  As far as alcohol goes, the LCB is in 
the fucking middle ages.  and it's all about money.  Goddamm, learn to 
write some laws that don't date back to fucking Prohibition!

And don't the cops have anything better to do, IN THE NORTH SIDE, of all 
places, than shut down a harmless party in a secured space before 2 am?

And people panicked when they saw the cops, and the party disbanded.  
Attempts to start it back up @ 168 disintegrated too, which is a shaem 
cuz Cassien's set was pretty nice.

Anyway, it was a really neat party that fell victim to some iffy 
decisions and bad luck.

Don't let that give you second thoughts about the next one, tho...and I 
expect there to be a next one, right guys?  You deserve props for your 
innovative ideas.  Don't let this get you down.

plur, plum, and a peach, steph

harmless? yes, but that is not our judgement, but the cops'.
secured? They wouldn't have busted it if it were secured. ...

then started driving back home, plans for sunrise still up in the air,
cracked OUT on NOOOO sleep so i hit the recline and pulled off the road,
slept for 30 minutes then it was on back home directly.  got there, waited
for darrik/mindkiss to come pick me up, on the wya home i called him and
made plans to ride down to bmore with him and two friends of his.  so i
chilled at my place and they came, and we went.  modern music, got a nutso
john cage rekkid NOISE :) saw db, feelgood, cornflake, eric, all these

The place *was* secured.  What's hard to do is keep the cops from just
barging in, which they did.  No one was at the front door keeping them
from walking up.  The space was private property, and technically, unless
the person "in charge" consents to them entering, they have no right.
Rights or not, however, it doesn't matter.  Sometimes Pittsburgh is so
lame it depresses me, but the efforts of very creative people here
(Stickman, Opus, TCRPS, UDG) make it a cool place every once and a while.

I'm sure everyone who was at Electric Kingdom was disappointed when the
police came, but don't let that get you down.  There are too many
positive things happening right now to be pessimistic.

Thanks to TCRPS for putting on such a cool event-

im still smiling from the wonderful sunrise sunday morning :)

that was a great party!  I luved the location (its so nice to go to outdoor
summer parties!), i LUVED the people, i luved the music...  i just had an
amazing time :)

First let me say though that getting to the party was quite a challenge.
 Going to baltimore from cleveland should take about 7hrs.  welp... we didn't
have tkts so we were going to stop in pgh at slacker.  Funny.  in one of my
great moments of brilliance i failed to get any sleep on friday night... i
partied way late with some friends and just ended up going straight to work
on sat morning... so i was sorta hoping to sleep some on the drive to balt.  

welp... my sunrise companion Iris took over the driving when we hit
pennsylvania.  She had never driven my car before and was particularily
nervous for some reason, or anxious, or sumthin.  Whatever it was, she
repeatedly was getting us AMAZINGLY lost.  I was dumbfounded.  It only took
us two hours to get to the pgh area from cle, but it took us about another 2
hrs to get to slacker!  THEN when we finally did get there, they had no tkts
left and they had not kept any directions either.  That was a bit frustrating
(especially considering i was pretty sleepy at this point and did not have
the heart to deal with such crap) so we just said fuck-it and took off for
baltimore b/c at this point it was already almost 9pm.  

So... we got to baltimore but we had a minor set back... the info line had no
directions on it.  The music store in baltimore was already closed (it was
already after 1am i think) and they didn't have any answering maching with a
message either... So we had no tkts, no dirxns, and no idea where it was in
baltimore.  the only thing we had was the flier which happened to sorta
mention that the party was at some harbor park.

so i took over the driving and we went on a quest for the Ferry Bar Park (i
think that is what it was called).  As could be expected - no one in
baltimore knew where this place was.  So we got ourselves directed towards
the harbor area.  From there we still could not find anyone who knew where
this place was.  We stumbled upon one nice 711 girl who knew what highway you
could see the park from, but she had no idea how you could actually get to
the park.  Finally one nice drunk man actually knew where this place was...
unfortunately his directions were not exactly great.  But it was a start.  To
our relief we did eventually find the place.  The security man tried to then
tell us there was no parking and we'd have to FIND a place to park.  I just
puppy-eyed him and we chatted a little and the nice man found us a place to
park right on the street that was the entrance to the park.

So we got to the party a little before 3.  We missed Feelgood :( although
while we were driving around missing his set - we were listening to a tape of
him.. so...   The place was beautiful - the little beach at the end was
GREAT.  We immediatly had all sorts of fellow cle/akron friends running up
and giving us hugs - TONS of friendly faces were there - EVERYBODY was SO
nice!

So DJ Sun spun to the sunrise, it was beautiful.  at one point I retired to
the beach for a little cozy sit down - and to my amazement i missed Scott
Henry's entire set.  I was so confused - i had heard his set begin and knew i
wanted to get up and go dance - but by the time i actually did get up (i
didnt think i was this slow:) )his set was over.  But thats alright, i was
disappointed - but i had been having fun the whole time so it didn't really
upset me.  

the afterhours at the indigo(im not sure - but i think thats what the place
was called) was really nice too... i really am just at a loss of words, the
whole night/day was just great fun - i luved it!

it was my first Ultraworld party -  now i know what ive been missing :)

lots of luv
leah

frankzero sed:
==================================================================
Well, lets see if my brain can handle trying to wrap up two of the most
intense days of my life in some sort of coherent concise grammatically
correct form.  Obviously, at this point, it can't... so here's the shit:

friday 5 pm get off work, head to OHIO for ACTIVE NOT PASSIVE an ele mental
party where i'm booked to spin...  arrive in ohio at 10:50, some people are
in this MAD HUGE tallll ass beautiful architecture studio space, and
basically i just chilled by myself for most of the evening.  played two sets
(one ok early night one and one shitty morning one) and met the COOOOOLEST
people!!! Kaykay, Satya, Brad/Ecto, Eluna, among others (dur brain futz now)
also, saw mike/allroy and jeff/stuff yay and this super cutie with jeff, her
name was mary.  I had a pretty fab time at this party, basically, what you
need to get out of this is
===================================================================== 

brad/ecto wuz there!! ahh!! i missed him when he wuz @ the last 
Trancendance in toronto! speakin o which, did anyone trek to that
party. it wuz on the same night as ACTIVE NOT PASSIVE & wuz s'posed
to be the last one - or atleast the last one before their change.
purdy phatty line-up too: the UR crew (aux88, rolando, suburban
knight) plus alchemist, eric downer, andy roberts, alorhythm, and
psychic warriors of gaia AND dubtribe live! remember dat trip 
jeff/stuff & mary went too.

i guess it serves me right for spending all that time up on the
roof @ ACTIVE NOT PASSIVE w/ christa - but it wuz definitely the
best view in the house (stars up above & ed tossing his cymbals
down below). props to satya for showing us the primo make-out
spot. it wuz more fun than the architecture class rooms last time!
so now kell & kevy know why stevie had such li'l recall of the 
music @ CHARM!

======================================================================
ELE MENTAL KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK IS UP!!! :) Eluna is the shit, and his
parties are FUN and WACKY!  GOOOOOOOOOO!!! if you get a chance, ever, to
make it to an ele mental party, by all means, do it! :) you will NOT regret
it :)
====================================================================== 

if u think ed is kewl, u should meet charles's mom! i thought ed's
mom would be cooler but she backed out from becoming gaga's newest
member cuz she had prior engagements down south - her fame has
crossed the border. ed will never live up to his mom's prominence =) !

        Once the cops made everyone clear out I asked a pig (politely, of
course) what the reason was for the bust. He told me that it was the 50 or
so people loitering in the street. See, although I'm quoting a pig, it
makes sense. If it is a *secured* space, then who's responsible for the
mugs outside of it? When you let people out onto a public street to hang
around, it really isn't a secured space anymore is it? Technically yes, you
can say that those people on the street have no affiliation with the people
inside. But realistically the cops and us ravers both know that's not true.
Also, the police are the last people you can deny entrance to, even in a
private space(although you are legally allowed to).
        That's whats FUCKED UP about our legal system. It has enough
loopholes to get us out of jail and yet at the same time it is enforced
with even more loopholes that can put us in. Innocent until proven guilty?
not in this country...
peace

howdy all...
you probably dont know me.. but i've been on this list for a while..
anyways, i took my test today and i am fcc licensed and ready to go!
now.. there is a little problem -- i have no rave dj skillz. i like the
music i like, and i will play it, but i can't mix or anything like that!
Starting @ 10am, I will be playing one hour of THE ORB and one hour of
BOB MARLEY just because there is an empty timeslot.. so why dont you
listen? i need some support here -- im probably the youngest dj out
there (15 yrs old) and it would be cool if y'all could listen in. 
peace -- thanks...

--zerozero--

ps -- is there anyone willing to teach a new dj how to mix w/ techno (i
would really like to learn how, and im way into the music and all.. i
just woudn't know where to start.
pps - i had to interrupt the writing of this message to go and clean up a
horrible disaster.. the majority of my record collection just got
flooded. since i am airing them out, the record should be fine -- but
the sleeves just wont be the same :(

since no one has posted a mainly jungle review of sunrise, here it goes.

the party was slammin.  from chris starchild's set, which featured
hisnewly pressed dub plate of 'the way we rock' featuring the fugees, it
got the party off to a fast start.  the junglists started filtering into
the first arena, afterr chris, infinity came on, and then lonnie entity
pushed up the levels with some severe jump up hardstep stuff i first
heard him spin at the beginning of the bukem party that was moved to the
raza space.  at this point, the drum and bass massive started calling
for the rewinds, pushing up lighters and blowing on 'dem horns.  after
entity got off, dara got on, and proceeded to 'tear shit up,' as dj/mc
clear said on the mic.  his set garnered about 10 rewinds, i thinik
getting 2 or 3 rewinds in a row during his set.  the junglists were
jumping up and down, putting hands up in the air, shouting their lungs
out, including myself. it was unreal.  there must have been 30-40 people
in the front of the dj booth who were totally in tune with dara's set
calling for the goddamn rewind each and every time.  mc clear from nyc
bluntlion was surprising me with his mc'ing skills.  he seems to have
been listening to some conrad at home.

after dara got off, at which the crowd gave him a standing? ovation, db
came in and let loose with two beautiful, bukem-esque songs, one of
which is on the new rebirth cd bukem has out, itwas on good looking. 
clear called db the smoothest stateside jungle selector and for a while,
it seemed well-merited.  db spun some classics, like horizon, stating it
was the 'evolution of jungle,' and also played pfm's western, at which
point i lost it.

i am glad to say i didn't see the fist fight, there were no bad vibes in
the jungle area, just tearin' tunes and a crowd which appreciated the
lick-shot tunes.

for those who care, junglettes were *IN-EFFECT*.  the mixing was tight
and by day break, i was dead-tired.
   it was a pitt/cmu reunion as adam darby, chris white, john balthazar,
russell, richard ting and others were sighted .......

respect to ultraworld and all jungle djs on the night.

On the Sunrise Jungle tip, I'd like to add a couple of things to Kenny's 
comments. First off, props to Lonnie for having a jungle area in the 
first place. It's good to see jungle finally getting the respect it 
deserves, with junglists cropping up on the bill at most major parties. 
And I agree with Kenny - the junglist vibe was strong and positive.

Between tending to the walking wounded in my travelling posse and walking 
around from zone to zone, I didn't spend as much time in the jungle area 
as I would have liked - I missed Lonnie's set, which I have heard widely 
praised, f'rinstance. Indeed, I pretty much caught only Dara's and DB's 
sets. Dara really did tear it up, didn't he? He has the skills - bang-on 
mixing, straight-up hard step, the edge softened with the occasional 
cooling drum'n'bass breeze. 

But personally I'm much more into the blissed-out 
intelligent/artcore/jazzcore/whatever sound, and did most of my Sunrise 
dancing during DB's set. Yeah, what Kenny said - I'm a big Bukem fan, and 
I can't tell you how fucking great it felt hearing the chiming intro to 
"Music" well up as the sun began to climb. But then again, I don't have 
to tell you - you were there. "Horizons", "Western", "Renegade Snares" - 
the set had so many of my favourite cuts. Heck, I'd have been happy if DB 
had spun nothing but Good Looking selections.

But one thing I disagree with Kenny about is MC Clear. I'll go on record 
as being ambivalent about MCs for jungle events, more specifically for 
the smoother stuff. Take Bukem - much of what he does is to generate a 
transcendent musical texture, sustain it and keep you out there in that 
space, feeling the rush of the drums and the whoosh of the 
strings. It's an intense and internal feeling, really kind of like flying 
to me. I can almost lie down on that sound, just let myself be carried 
away by it. What I *don't* need is MC Clear giving shout-outs to "the cute 
ladies inside", advertising the next MC Clear event, dedicating cuts to 
his posse and delivering bons-mots such as "his musical selection/will 
give you an erection". It completely works against the dj's work.

To compare Clear to Conrad is to diss Conrad cruelly - Conrad is pretty 
much the best jungle MC I've heard, leagues ahead of Clear, whose Old 
Skool roots (read: stompin' hiphop ego) are worn loud and proud. And, in 
truth, I'm not crazy about Conrad - I'd rather hear Bukem spin by 
himself. For my money, the only disappointing thing about the Logical 
Progression compilation is that Bukem used the Vocal Mix of PFM's "Western".

In a live setting, the MC can move the crowd a little, but I think Djs 
spinning smooth drum'n'bass should just take the risk and spin without an 
MC. Indeed, Bukem's MixMag CD, the mixCD in the Logical Progression set 
and the bootleggish Rebirth CD are all infinitely superior to the Bukem 
set on the Promised Land CD set, which features Conrad MCing. I 
was glad when someone (DB, I presume) finally yanked the plug on Clear.

Anyway, thoroughly enjoyed DB's set; special notice to DB's own Nu 
Emotion record (the one with the hardcore 808 rhythms and the spattering 
acid lines), and the anthemic hardcore sendoff. 

While I"m still blathering on about Bukem, I shall mention that Logical 
Progression gets a domestic release on ffrr at the end of July, and Bukem 
will be doing a US tour in August to promote it. I've also heard that 
Bukem is no longer doing Speed, the THursday night club in London which 
he cofounded with Fabio - anyone confirm or refute that?

peace

jaze

O.K., I think I'm back together now after trying to make amends/repairs 
after the Run-Come.  Anyways, I was most disappointed to see Johnny Law 
bust into the middle of my set, beam me in the eye with a flashlight and 
inform me that it's all over.  Their reasons were noise complaints (hard 
to believe 'cause you could barely hear the system outside), people 
hanging out in the parking lot, and beer.  

Well, I don't think we had any choice about keeping them at bay because
they basically lined up at the door and barged in without waiting to ask
for permission or anything like that (as Tom noticed), so forget about
denying them entrance if you ever have cops show up at your door.  There
was some beer in sight that they confiscated, but I doubt there was more
than a case in the whole place, and most of the people drinking were
over-21. Funny how they totalled missed the pirate radio setup.  I thought
that was kind of interesting.  I was standing on the DJ riser when a cop
pulled back the curtain where the transmitter was hidden and called to his
boys "AHA, look what I found!"  I thought we were done for, you know, FCC
and all, only to discover that Mr. Officer had found two cans of Miller
light to add to the confiscated beer pile.  He was obviously confused as
to what to make of the transmitter :-) Did anyone get to hear the party 
on the radio?  I drove around for a while to check it out and the signal 
came in loud and clear.  Big Up Free Radio Pittsburgh for the pirate link!

Anyways, from what I hear (since I was trying to get into my set at the
point they showed up), they "knew this was one of those raves and there
was nothing we could do to stop it from being shut down" regardless of the
fact that the owner of the space was right there trying to inform them
that they have an entertainment license and that the space was a secured
art gallery.  I guess permits don't mean much when there's a police
mission to accomplish. 

I just have to say that everything was nice and lovely up till then and I 
was having a great time.  Security will have to be more strict next time, 
I just hate to have to lock people in a space, but I guess the streets 
will have to be cleared and everyone searched at the door from now on.  
No beer, even if you are 21, etc.

Respects to Tom, firstly for a great set, and secondly for understanding 
how things go out of control no matter how much one tries to plan for 
them.  I'm sure Ed will have more to say on this, and we plan to offer a 
free make-up party, both for the crews that had to leave EK before they 
were ready and for the DJs who lined up their sets without a chance to 
express them.  Sorry for the fuck-up, y'all.  We'll make it right somehow!

Alright. Stickman Rick would like more people to spin ambient or chill

and if someone is willing to lend a synth module with some trippy pads,
I'll be delighted to do a live chill set. (It would be better if I played
over some soothing breakbeats, or any delicate percussion, anyone?)
email me if you are willing to spin for Ricks new number.

Subject: tekknoBOX 2: final beta available!
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

Sorry for the gross cross-posting of this advert, but it might be
of interest to this particular mailing list...  this is the final
beta before the software goes commercial. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------
                   T  E  K  K  N  O  B  O  X    2
                                ----
   T  H  E     B  E  A  T  P  H  R  E  A  K    M  A  C  H  I  N  E 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

tekknoBOX 2 is a MIDI sequencer geared towards the production of
dance music; anything from house to tekkno to gabber to industrial
to whatever.  It's the first sequencer for Windows with those
design ideals in mind.

tekknoBOX 2 features:

- Up to 256 MIDI tracks
- Up to 256 patterns, arrangeable into a 2000 pattern memory song 
- Easy to learn 16-step based pattern sequencer, based on the
  sequencers found in Roland X0X boxes and the doepher analog
  sequencer. 
- MIDI Sync In and Out for the slaving and controlling of other
  MIDI devices.
- Unique Phrase sequencer for quickly building complex tracks
- Unique mute feature with a memory function to recall complex mute
  settings easily.
- Exporting of tekknoBOX songs and phrases to MIDI files 
- Unique Data Doodler data filter for drawing in controller or note
  data. 
- Complete sequencing for all 127 continuous controllers
- 4 playback modes
- Control of the box's functions from external MIDI controllers
- Works with any soundcard/MIDI card
- Open ended architecture allows third parties to create plug-ins
  to add functionality to the BOX.
- A hardware controller is available for complete knob-twiddling
- Plus a host of other goodies.

TekknoBOX has been in development for a year now, this final beta
is a rock solid work.  For the next month and a half we are selling
this final beta for half the cost of the final version.

Note: Control of the box from an external midi device isn't
included in this beta, but is being developed at the moment. 
Otherwise the beta has all other features enabled.

You can find the beta on most FTP sites around, or you can go
directly to the source:

via the web: http://www.inneraktive.com
via ftp: ftp.inneraktive.com in /inneraktive

Thanks!

well since several people have asked me how it went i'll say a few words 
about the event.

first of all, although it was maddeningly frustrating, i _will_ do it
again.  that's to satisfy those of you who wrote me with encouragement
(sorry i havent had time to reply to you all individually...but a lot of
you supported my idea of an deeper kind of event). 

i won't dwell on the negatives...which basically boiled down to me 
running around, hot weather, and the loss of some money...

but i will briefly mention the positives.  dreamcycle had a beautiful set,
extremely well put together...very ambient but definitely NOT boring. 
full brain/mike brown laid down some wicked songs as always...that helped
too. 

but the real show-stealers were todd sines and charles noel as a.r.s...man
this shit is GOOD.  atmospheric, experimental, AND DANCEABLE?!?!  dont
ask, just SEE them next time i can drag them out to play live again...

let's see...brian gillespie played some great songs including eddy 
grant's "electric avenue" and even sillier stuff...

timbient was the real relaxer for me.  i hope people get more of a chance
to hear him someday, his selection is amazing.  droning, warm but scary (i
know it sounds hard to believe)...just what i needed. 

thanks to everyone who helped, thanks to count zero for driving so far and
saying the kind words in his review (and for spinning some of the most
eclectic sets i've ever heard...i thought _i_ was bad), and of course
thanks to everyone who was there in spirit. 

wishing he had checkerboard sleeves,

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

*Note*  I started a section on info lines.  i have by no means finished 
   it.  Stevie T gave me alot to start with, and i'm thinking of 
   including email addys and URLs, so if you know of any, email me!
*Note*  There is a section for weekly stuff, but need input on these.  if 
   you have any info line and want it listed, by all means, send me email!
*Note*  There is now the beginnings of a radio program listings at the 
   end of the rom, i know there are more, i just don't know them.  (help??) 

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

Fri Jun 28               GO FASTER preparty netmeet            Pittsburgh

hello fellow net friends! This is Crisbee! Hossam and i have been talking 
to a bunch of you and since so many of you are thinking about coming 
here for Go Faster we thought we would have a pre-net meet! This meet 
will be about 15 minutes from the actual sight of the party! It is going 
to be right off the Monroeville Exit of the PA turn pike too!  The place 
is Chuck E.Cheese's!  Thats where I work and I thought it would be a great 
place for eveyone to meet and hang out before hand! There will be pizza 
and soda and *some* free tokens to play games and win prizes!  woo hoo! 
;) It wont cost more then like $5 or $6 each, either! I still have to 
talk to my manager to see if she'll give me a bigger discount! I think i 
can convince her! ;)
	I'm not quite sure what time everything is going to take 
place. The party starts at 10 so I thought like 8 to 11 or whenever you 
wanted to leave! The store closes at 11 so we all have to be gone by at 
least then!
	So thats our idea! All I need now is anyone who is thinking of 
coming to email me or hossam *privately*!!! As soon as possible! I would 
need to know if you are coming by at latest the 21st! So please get back 
to us as soon as you can! Trust me this will be lots of fun! Good food, 
unlimited drinks, games, prizes, and best of all friends!!  hahaha hope 
to hear from some of you soon! Also if you ahve any other ideas please 
say so!

much love
crisbee

***FOR CLEVELAND BUS TRIP INFO CALL: 216.221.0568 for cheryl or ian

The Church (cleveland), Unity Groove (kentucky), & Park Rave Madness (NYC)
are offering us a safe way to travel [to Fantasia 2]. But we need your
interest to make it possible. the travel package includes tix, bus fare,

info:

F A N T A S I A   I I

in the beginning house was a feeling, and from this feeling came the music.
the music came together to create the atomosphere and then the summer of 
love.
but the people grew disillusioned and became divided. different forms of 
music
were created and a new generation of ravers were born. techno was the new
feeling. and from techno emerged music that incorporated sounds of a new era.
the music was more than just a feeling, it was a way of life. intelligent
music for intelligent minds. detrimental drums and bassline. music for the
future. so as the beats and the bass thunder down, we bring forth the knights
of the underground.

where exactly is the irish center in squirrel hill? i've heard it is
somewhere close to frick park. actually, i guess my real question is:
can you walk there from the cmu campus? (without getting a heart attack
or passin out). is the place far away or what?

hey i'm finally back, r.o.t.c. camp was great, i could have stayed the
whole summer (except for the facts that i couldn't go to any parties +
we weren't allowed to drink + the food was kind of bad!). our flight
(which is a group of 22 people they put each person in) won a zillion
awards, so many we lost track of all of them, including honor flight 
of the entire encampment. we had marksmanship training & shot 9mm 
pistols, survival training in the woods where we made tents & secret 
traps, JETO (jet orientation, since it's the air force) & i got to 
steer a jet + make it go upside down; but most of the time camp was
just a lot of stress + hard work. but near the end we did have a
dance, although it wasn't anything close to a rave, they played a lot
of disco music (!)--+ even the colonels who were old like probably 60
or something, along with the rest of the officers, were really getting 
down! they could dance pretty well. y.m.c.a. was already like the
unofficial theme song, kind of ironic, but nobody asked & nobody
told. anyway i just wanted to say i was back...

whats up kids...:)

well, with all the talk of how great the jungle area was at sunrise
(respect goes out to the ultraworld)...we here in pittsburgh would like to
invite you to witness as we --- go.....faster......

some of the most highly acclaimed jungle selectahs stateside will be in
attendance at this event, including the favourites from sunrise festival..
db and dara....

i just wanted to say one thing on the subject of mc's...and i know im
sticking my neck out on this one...but i agree with most of the sentiments
regarding mc clear...i mc'ed with him at vibration in the jungle room along
with dub2...and i found him to be rather annoying... not only had he been
babbling all nite in some incoherent tongue.. what he said was irritating
becasue it wasnt delivered properly either...when u get an mc whose
relentless yammering is coupled with a delivery that doesnt flow with
the track, you end up with alot of pissed off kids in the jungle room...who
then become negatively biased against *all* mc's...

as far as i'm concerned.. the role i play as an mc is someone who is there
to *hype up the crowd*...to help them get more into the music, to draw
their attention to a wicked mix, or to call for the rewind when they ask
for it...:)

it's not about babbling to hear the sound of my own voice, or to give
shout outs to my homeys and the fly junglettes in the area. i hate it when
an mc takes away from the enjoyment of the music...(the opposite of what
they are supposed to do)

more often than not, ill just shut the hell up and let the track and the dj
speak for themselves..i dunno i think that may be why some ppl say they like my
style...i dont pretend to be a "jungle" mc coz im not.. i dont have the mad
flowing rhymes like my boy joe/dub2..and i dont have nearly the wicked
voice of the one like mc rogue...all i have is a love and appreciation for the
music, a desire to pump up the crowd and make them go absolutely fucking
crazy over the sounds they are hearing... i really enjoy what mc'ing.. id
have to say the top 3 nites out (in no order) glow in oct of 94 when i
asked the crowd of 1800 to 'make some noise if you like the sound of my dj
dieselboy' and a huge roar came up and 3600 hands shot into the air...i
still get a rush thinking about that....and then at good fever in bmore in
spring of 95...seemd like there were over 1000 ppl jammed into the front
room and damian was ripping shit up and the crowd response was tremendous
and everyone was going nuts.. i really let loose on the mike that nite
(with dieselboy playing asend's 12 o'clock drop and the new (at the time) j
majik on white label how could i not go crazy) and it was really nice to
look over and see scott henry smiling in approval and even lonnie mr 'i
hate mc's" came up and told me i didnt suck that nite...:) -- finally this
past november 95 in pittsburgh at underground inc's BOOM! absolutely wicked
with the most insane cru of junglist in the house callin for the
rewind..nuff respect goes out to them...last 3 tracks all got called back
and played again on account of their being sooo slammin...

...i love mc'ing in pittbsurgh and bmore coz they
really respond to an mc...(i hate it when you are yelling at a bunch of
kids, all just standing around, staring....DANCE DAMMIT!)

so this got long and off topic as usual...trying to wrap things up here i
have to give big respect to mc dub2 for his love and *committment* to
jungle.. as well as mc rogue for having the ruffneck style :)

so...*please* come to go faster.. we're gonna put on an absolutely blinding
show on for you guys...lots of free giveaways...and you get to choose
whether you want to be in the whistle posse or the lighter cru as u walk
thru the door (yup, free whistles and lighters! ...:)


thats about it, i've said too much as it is... respect goes out to each and
everyone of you who know the score...see you this friday nite in
pittsburgh.

peace,
hossam

greetings y'all,

just wanted to say thanks for all who came to our, involuntarily
shortened event,
ELECTRIC KINGDOM last friday. my apologies to all attendees who didn't
get their monies worth and to dj's/artists who didn't get to perform. 

in attempt to make amends, we TCRPS are planning a upcoming free event,
entitled "LET'S *&@?! AND MAKE UP: THE PAYBACK" featuring all local dj's
whose ELECTRIC KINGDOM sets were pre-empted, plus hopefully WE and
CASSIEN from NYC. keep yr eyes peeled mid to late JULY.

more on the misfortunate Run-Come-->
yes the space was secured. according to the police, there were no noise
complaints.
their excuse for breaking up party: undesirable numbers of 'kids'
hanging out in parking lot and in front of the building at undesirable
hour.

i spoke with the officers, 7 or 8 of them, outside before they entered
the space. they asked me what 'this' was all about. i told them it was
an electronic art event. they replied angrily, "stop yr lying! we know
what this is, it's a rave!" at that point, giving me no opportunity to
refuse them entrance, they barged their way up into the space and began
searching for incriminating evidence. behind a curtain one of the
officers found a 40 ounce. with much delight he brought it to the sgt.
in charge, who then proceeded to throw all attendees out.

after 'the law' had accomplished their anti-fun mission, the previously
vehement sgt. turned all sweety on me, saying what a nice event this
looked like and how we all looked like nice respectable people (by which
i think he meant mostly white.)

most of the blame for this outcome should be attributed to a lack of
sufficient security for the event. this is a mistake we, the organizers,
made and will not make again. a way to avoid this problem would have
been to make it 'lock-down'/'no- readmittance-type' affair (while
providing sufficient 'chill' space inside, as someone here suggested).
personally i have always detested 'lock-down'-type affairs
and wanted to avoid this. this lax-ness of security came at a cost to all.

as tom butcher noted, the powers that be in pittsburgh do seem unfairly
intent on
disallowing fun of our kind to be had. we as a people in this country
are GREATLY
over-policed. a racist, unjust and hugely over-armed DEADLY police force
in service of a government of beaucratic stooges for a capitalist
kingdom of the patriarchal familial rich; all intent on keeping thing's
the same, people's minds small and freedoms limited, and pleasure's few,
mass-produced and sanitized.

what a joke that a happening as harmless and mellow as ELECTRIC KINGDOM
would warrant being busted!!! proof enough of the bloated numbers of
'law enforcers' currently on patrol here in pittsburgh, no doubt. 

yet, also as tom butcher noted, odds against us, it all matters not.
creative happenings with vision for a better future, now, will continue
unabated. gotta live now, gotta try n make a change. no choice but to do
it and keep doing it.

much props to all pittsburgh underground creative forces!
(UDG, JiveTurkeys/Stickman, ADK, Lollipop, InSync, ...)

much thanks to all peoples who made ELECTRIC KINGDOM, while it lasted, truly
fucking beautiful!!! --->DOUBLE O n DIMENTED, STATIC, MUTAMASSIK, WE, CASSIEN,

This is candy to my ears...!

All this talk about hardcore on ne-raves from people besides Skinner, 
Chris Green and I... what is this?  Have people finally started to see 
the light?  

There is talk about people wanting Baltimore to have some hardcore... I 
say for Christ's sake do it!  I haven't heard hardcore at a party 
since... hmmm... I'd have to go back to Morph 1 in Pittsburgh *3* years 
ago.  Starting off in the scene (in Pittsburgh) back in '92, that is what 
I've been 'born and bred' on, and I find it sad to watch hardcore, hard 
acid and trance being pushed to the back burner over the years...  My 
current 'fixes' are satisfied by some totally mindfuck Deadly Buda and 
Lenny Dee tapes that I have in my collection, which have been worn down 
over the course of time from repeated listenings...

SO, I ask, where is this rebirth of cool coming from?  This conversation 
was milled around in our heads about two months ago (in Pittsburgh) when 
me, Stickman, Sasha and Joe LeSesne were commenting that styles aren't 
getting represented that much anymore... (after listening to D-Cypol's 
fine ass happy hardcore mix)... So rick proposed throwing ORTHO, 
Pittsburgh's first *aLL HARDCORE* event (and free, at that) to happen in 
years... And if you look at the list, this has become a reality, with our 
own Skinner heading down to the Golden Triangle to drop some serious 
mentality on our scene...  See if y'all can figure out the name behind 
the event.. it's not that hard to decipher...

So, let the parties begin!  If you're into hardcore, or curious to what 
EXACTLY it is, ask your friendly local promoter to book some talent.  
It's out there, contrary to popular belief.  There are so many DJs out 
there that still spin trax other than house, jungle and trip hop.  Look 
into it.  Expand your tastes... you might just like it. 

 Personally, I think hardcore moves me more than any other style.  It exudes,
 raw, unadulterated power, and never compromises, never wanes..  It contains 
sounds unlike what you've ever heard before... from raw, scraping  metal 
samples to the perfectly placed 'plink' sound that could have been 
sampled from banging a titanium steel screw against a steel plate in 
someones head... who knows?  Discover for yourselves...like I said, it's 
OUT THERE.

Allright... I'd really like to see this often misrepresented and confused 
genre take form in the scene once again.  

And I don't want to hear that people can't dance to it.   rubbish.

There you have it... my long and somewhat confusing post... take it as 
you will... I'm listening to Sterelab as I speak right now so my brain is 
obviously distracted at the moment...

slater days...

Big shouts to the one mindkiss as well.  Nice to see ya' jammin on the 
dancefloor there.  I had a blast, although getting up for work was a 
little tough today :-).  If any of y'all ever get a chance, definitely 
stop by the deformed night at Cedars.  There was a nice, friendly crowd 
and plenty of different styles of music to hear, besides ... no cover!  I 
still can't believe that one.

That weekend started Thursday afternoon for me and my crew. We loaded up the 
truck and left for Murfreesboro, TN to get some gear and headed for St Louis. 
We got to St Louis around 7 am, got some sleep and went to the space to set up 
the first room and second room. The pre-party started at 11 pm. I think around 
300 or more people showed up. My problem was the heat and the damm 
mouskitouZZes. Every one was outside. The music was on only in the second 
room. Due to the excessive heat, all the amps (Crown) kept on shutting down. 
Too many drugs were present (i was offered all kinds of stuff including roofie 
and coke ?????)

Saturday afternoon, we came back to set up the third sound system.
Saturday was even hotter. Same as friday night, most of people were outside, 
because it was was too hot inside. The temperature reached 112 inside the 
warehouse. 

DJ's :
-Express....only shit...it was the first time I heard him, but he was 
goooooooood, really good
-Dieselboy : perfect as usual....mad at myself for not taping his set. he is 
probably mad at me too for forgetting to press record...sorry Damian
-Glenn Underground : good....weird mixing technik.....he got people going 
crazy
-DJ Ice : perfect mixing.....
-Carlos : stop...shit....catch a deep breath ----> fucking A+....he did the 
best job I have ever seen him do....His set was excellent.....more than 
excellent. he was boucing around while spinning, he scratching was better than 
anyone else I have seen in the last 4 years. I am going to enjoy listenning to 
his set over and over until the tape dies.

I did not hear any other dj in the other two rooms, because I had to watch the 
temperature in the racks to prevent shit from happening.

The after party got shut down.

bad point : to much heat, but who can control that and to many drugs.

See you at V in St Louis July 5-6 and Forever this weekend

Um ok here is a little update to what is going on:??J|

1) the name badges:  i am going to make a color computer graphic and then have
it printed on heavy set paper.  I will then cut them into the proper size.  I
am also going to be buying those pastic name tage holder things that have pins
on the back so that you can pin them onto your shirt.  This will serve two
purposes.  one you can change clothes all you want and your name badge can come
along, two hopefully it will be waterproof.

Ok i will not be putting your names on your name badges.  I'm going to leave a
blank spot where you can do this.  This is being done for a few purposes too,
one i don't want to discriminate against anyone, just because someone isn't a
net raver dosen't mean that they shouldn't be able to be apart of the fun,
otherwise you would have to take the U our of PLUR.  Now anyone that wants to
share the love and vibe is welcome too.  Second, for some of you that are
artistic, you can put some orginality into your name tag, it will be able to
show a little personality.

anyways thta's what i am doing, i hope no one is too upset

2) about the food sharing stuff:  I still would like to do this even though i
haven't really heard anything from many people about this, so i decided to take
a little initiative.  I went out today while getting some blow pops for Forever
(sorry i only got 5 pounds to pass out) i ordered a 25 pound box of them,  that
means that you all better stop by or i am going to have a lot of blow pops to
lick down myself.  I hope that others will join in a bring along some goodies
to share.

3)about the table:  I have had only one person respond about them so at this
point i am not going to bring them unless i get a lot more responces.  Sorry
but i'm bringing so much stuff already i don't want to bring something that's
not going to be used.

Anyways i'm off, enough babbling, got any question, drop me some e-mail.  I
won't be around this weekend.  Oh i will be decorating my car and shit so you
know where the spot is,  I'll give you more details next week but it
shouldn't be to hard to spot.

Well...I know a few of the DJ's from here in Nashville, so assuming the party
is not TOO terribly far away, I would be willing to rent a van or what not
and drive up with some kickass DJ's as well as a live act that I know 
that is high-quality and would be definitely willing to perform.  If 
turntables are really a problem, I'm sure one of the DJ's would be willing
to bring theirs... 

If you are from Nashville and would like to do a van share type thing 
with me, send me mail!  Also those super luxury buses with TV's and 
showers and beds and stereos and shit are like $400 I think, I know this 
woman whose husband drives one for a living, so if we can get like 10 or 
so Nashvillians in on it we could travel in luxury and shit :)

>1) what does ambient music mean to u?

Ambient music, in my opinion, is experimental, artistic, and atmospheric.
Ambient creates an entire multidimensional setting for the listener.  It is
the musician's muzak, it is the raver's relaxation.  It can be anything,
though, really. 

>   what is ambient culture about to u?

I didn't know there was an "ambient culture" out there. If there is, I'm not
sure I want to be a part of it.  ;)

>
>2) recollections of favorite count zero performances

My favorite "gig" so far would have to be Deformed (before it had that name)
at Cedars in Youngstown, Ohio.  I played there on Wednesday May 15th '96.
Aside from the negative attitude I got from one person (another dj i might
add, who wanted to hear "house music" :P which, strangely enough, i played
some of)  the night was wonderful! :) My set seemed to fall together like
magic, and there were people dancing, which totally blew my mind.  The crowd
really seemed to enjoy it, and that made me get into it even more :) That
night, someone came up to me and gave me a sign he made that said "Count
Zer0 Rulez!"  I was completely flabbergasted.  That absolutely made my
night, and I knew I must have been doing something right.  

>
>3) thoughts on ambient music/dj's relation to rave culture

Ambient music exists outside of the rave culture, and that is where it is at
its strongest.  For ambient to thrive in rave culture is, essentially, to
deny it of its own identity.  However, this contradiction can surely be
overcome.  I try to overcome it in all my ambient sets, and I have seen many
other djs do the same thing.  

>4) experiences/descriptions of BALTIMORE's ambient scene

Baltimore has one of the most succesful ambient scenes on the east coast. As
a matter of fact, aside from greenwich village in nyc, Baltimore is probably
the most accepting city towards ambient music.  Sonic Soul's "cloudwatch"
events, although not always strictly "ambient" do an incredible job of
exposing ravers to new music.  Ultraworld's bigger raves often have a well
orchestrated "chill-out" room.  Modern Music, Baltimores best record store,
has an extensive selection of ambient vinyl and cds.  Other east coast
cities and rave scenes should look to baltimore as an example of what can be
done with ambient music, and then attempt to move in a new direction. 

>5) descriptions of yr style vs. other ambient music/dj's

I  try to be as eclectic as possible without being disjointed.  I sometimes
try to appeal to the average raver listener, although I never play a track
_I_ don't like, and I ALWAYS play some songs I think ravers WONT like, just
to mess with their minds.  Lately my djing has been moving simultaneously in
two different directions, when it comes to strict ambient, I have been more
expermental in my mixing style recently, while, at the same time improving
my beatmatching skills for the dancefloor.  
>
>6) favorite ambient artists/music/happenings
>

Cloudwatch May 18, 1996, Baltimore, MD.  Terre Thaemlitz went on right after
me, and completely blew my mind.  He wasn't simply playing records, he was
actually writing musical compositions with records, cds, and DAT.  He really
set an incredible mood.  Then, later that night, DJ Spooky (the subliminal
kid) took jungle and trip hop to an entirely different level.  His mixing
was unlike anything I had ever heard before.  Sound collage at its finest,
yet danceable too.  

>7) upcoming events u'll be spinning at

Wednesday July 17th Deformed, Cedars lounge, Youngstown, OH
Saturday August 10th, LOST CITY (Ultraworld "rave") Baltimore, MD

>8) thoughts on future of ambient?

RIDE TO PITTSBURGH WANTED!

Hey kids...

I'm looking to find a ride down to Pittsburgh from Boston on the weekend 
of July 19th... I'm in Brookline, and am willing to pay money for gas, 
food and all that jazz...  Housing is GUARUNTEED as my family lives there.

There's this event that I REALLY want to attend, it's hush hush at the 
moment, but let me add that it's absolutely, positively FREE and will be 
AMAZING.  So if anyone in Boston or the general area is willing to take 
the trip down with me, I will be forever in their debt.  Pittsburgh is a 
great place-- I'd like to show someone how our crew throws down...

I can be reached at 617.278.0235 or at hannibal@acs.bu.edu if you're 
interested.  Please reach me as soon as possible!

Thanks a lot...

Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

hey all, finally finished recuperating from ortho!
whata time!  for anyone who wasn't there, here's a short 
little review thingie....

first off, the party was busted at its' original location before
it even had a chance to start.  someone had tipped the cops 
off as to what was happening, because they were there at 
9:30.  downright pissed me off.  does anyone have the 
story on this?
    so the party was moved to someones house up by the zoo.
(whose house was it anywasy?)  it was amazing that the party 
didn't get busted here either (at least while i was there)!!!
the volume was way loud, and there were people hanging out all 
over the place outside.  i could hear the music from a block 
away!  oh yeah, there were many many many people there.
pretty tuff to estimate because so many of them were inside, 
outside, and all over, but i'd say that a guess of 300 is 
pretty close to accuracy...
    i spent just about all night downstairs in the hardcore area.
the upstairs was playing mellow house both times i was up there.
the basement was definitely the place to be.
first dj up (whose name i know not) played a nice hard acid set
  with the usual 303's and analogs.
the second dj (whose name i also know not) played a beautiful
  hard trance set.  some of his mixing was a tad off towards the
  beginning of his set, but i'd bet it had something to do with the
  minor sound problems with the amps.  they'd cut out occasionally.
  this problem was fixed pretty quickly though and thus his mixing
  was better.
next up was eric justin spinning cute house.
  well, i guess it was a bit harder than usual, but it was still house
  and not really hardcore.  his set was flawless as usual though,
  and the crowd was njoiing it  (especially the frat boys who somehow
  wondered into the place......the made asses of themselves, but had
  a good time doing it and didn't really disturb anything, so i respect
  them).
after eric came the one, the only,,,,,d-cypol!  definitely my highlight
  of the night.  his set of happy hardcore really just blew me and 
  everyone in the place away!  he started with some breakbeatier stuff,
  moved into some stompier stuff, then ended with a breathtaking 
  mix of happy gabber that put a halo around everyone's head!!!!
  he is an amazing dj who not only spins hh, but spins house, acid,
  and jungle as well.  i'm glad to see he's being booked here alot now!
next up was skinner from industrial strength.  he spun the most 
  menacing sounds pittsburgh has heard in a long time (if ever).
  his mix of 220 bpm+ angry, distorted, evil gabber scared a bunch of 
  the people away, but the remaining few were really into it.
  it is hard to comment on his mixing skills because every track was 
  all cut up and noisey to begin with.  my sympathies to whoever
  owned them speakers...
then came formation who played another great hard trance set.
  i had to leave halfway through his set because i was thoroughly
  exhausted thanks to mr. skinner....

anyone want to fill me in on what happened after i left?  

all in all, the party was a success in my opinion.
it would have been nice to have had a larger and more ventilated space,
but the hardcore people didn't seem to mind.  

now the question is "will the styles played at ortho be played more often
in pittsburgh?"  i surely hope so, and i think that others would like it
as well.  listen up promoters.

love,
ryu

I would guess that there were @ most 20 people inside @ ortho. It had
the same problem as go faster: it was just too damn hot. I have a

about go faster ... where was everyone? In NYC i usaully complain about 
overcrowding, not enough space. I hardly ever get lonley ;) hehe ...
