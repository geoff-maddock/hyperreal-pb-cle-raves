synthvortx@aol.com doesnt like the way i run the rom and says hyperreal is
a joke and is concerned about the state of the rom with the beastie boys
and front 242 listed on it.  comments to trout@hyperreal.org

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events, just testing this out and we'll see what the
reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

in association with
CIRCLE, SONIC SOUL, and 2-TUFF

Saturday November 28 1998
Washington DC prepares to
 
E  N  E  R  G  I  Z  E

Thanksgiving weekend, Ultraworld will present the most 
spectacular event in its 6 year history. It will be held 
in the massive DC Armory, and while there have been four 
previous events in this space, none will compare to the 
spectacle of Energize.

The main arena of this space has over 100,000 sqft of 
wide-open wooden floor, but what will set Energize
apart from our previous events is that we will make use
of additional space in the basement! The basement has
40' ceilings and is the same size as the main floor but
divided into three massive sections. For the first time 
at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all 
with full on concert level production in both sound and 
lighting.  


>>The Main Floor:

Ultraworld will fill this space with the best sound system they
have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of 
lasers, projection screens and intelligent lighting. Appearing
On the main floor:

Exclusive live performance by 
CARL CRAIG as Paperclip People (Planet E, Detroit)

with DJs
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI (Matsuri Productions, London/Tokyo)
DOC MARTIN (Tight, Los Angeles)
DJ ICEY (Zone, Orlando)
SCOTT HENRY (Buzz, Washington DC)
T-1000 (Generator/DJax, Detroit)
NIGEL RICHARDS (611 Records, Philadelphia)

 
>>The Drum N Bass arena:

In one of the basement areas, Ultraworld and 2-Tuff are 
proud to present a selection of the best Drum 'N' Bass talent 
the US has to offer, alongside two of the originators of the
UK scene. In the d'n'b arena:

GROOVERIDER (Sony/Prototype, UK)

SLANT (2 Tuff, Washington DC)
ENTITY (Ultraworld, Baltimore)
FLUID (Sonic Soul, Baltimore)

>>The House arena:

This second basement area is bigger then any dance club 
on the East Coast. It will be hosted by Philadelphia's
Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long. 

DERRICK CARTER (Organico, Chicago)
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION (Universal Language, UK)

want to...

is DC's premier club event, held every Friday by DJ's Scott
Henry and Lieven De Geyndt. It plays host to the world's top 
DJ's and live acts on a weekly basis. When you purchase

Hmmm ... Reading all your Q and A lists made me aware of the fact that
a lot of my answers are different from yours.  As in, I am the only
person so far who does not believe in ghosts and who wants more than 2
kids ... I'm wondering what that says about me v. all you guys ...

Is anybody here going to Trilogy on friday to see DJ Harware?  Is that a
rave, or is that just going to be one special dj spinning that night?
Well, if any of you are going to be there let me know!  Thank you all.

ok, i am still going to hullabaloo, but amy can't go. and so far i am
going to pick up one person on the way (joel pryde in pittsburgh). that
leaves space for 3 more people in my car. if anybody else is on the way
(at least sort of) + needs a ride reply privately, because i'm only
keeping careful track of personal messages (no time) and you should save
bandwidth too.

Review of "Motive": Saturday, September 26, 1998

BILL OF RIGHTS, RAVER STYLE

Article 1 -- "Waiting in Line"

It only took just over 2.5 hours to drive to Columbus from Cleveland,
Ohio.  Since this was my first Columbus party, I was pretty excited.
Although the directions were decent, I still ended up taking a quick tour
of Columbus' worst ghettos (and to think I forgot my camera!).

When I got to the school house which had been rented out for "Motive", I
was astonished to see a long line that snaked its way through much of the
parking lot.  Since it was midnight and I heard a hard bass eminating from
the inside, I knew that the event was underway.  But what was up with that
line?  I reluctantly went to the end of it and tried to blend in.  Since I
virtually never wear 'raver gear' and am slightly older that most of the
party-goers in Ohio, it's always a little strange standing in the raw,
yellow light of a parking lot, waiting to get inside.  It also didn't help
that I apparently was one of the only people who had brought along food
for the homeless -- normally this wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact
that I had decided to tote along an extra large jar of pickles instead of
the more traditional can of food.  So there I was in my bright orange Gap
t-shirt, shorts, conservative brown haircut . . . and my best friend the
pickle jar.  I expected silence for quite some time to come.

But a very bizarre thing happened.  Instead of being ignored as I
expected, I ended up being included in conversations all around me.  This
is a great thing about parties that is almost never addressed, namely,
that waiting outside in line can often be one of the best moments of the
whole night. It's an opportunity to really see and hear what those around
you have to say.  I was amazed at the neighborly nature of these Columbus
people.  (I was going to say "Columbus kids", but one of the people I
spoke with turned out to be 43!)  I would later run into a good half dozen
of the fast friends I made outside, and when I did, it felt as if I had
been seeing them at parties for months.

Article 2 -- "Tour of Duty"

When I go to a party, I always make sure I at least enter and walk all the
way around every room and hallway before settling down in any one place.  
This enables me to know my options and at least experience everything once
before getting comfortable in any one spot.  The main room was the
school's auditorium.  The set up here was right on target.  They had five
intelligent lights above the stage and the speakers wisely elevated above
the crowd.  If Don/Wizard Workshop is doing the sound, you know it'll be
just right!  There was also plenty of dry ice smoke which made the lights
that much more impressive.  Another key of the main room -- besides a
wooden dancefloor -- was the tiered balcony. If you preferred not to dance
or sit on the gym floor, you could climb up the steps and sit on the
chairs or white tables there, allowing a great unobstructed view of the
entire main room.

The second floor of the schoolhouse venue was mainly hallway, bathrooms
and vendors. I loved the fact that there was an entire chillout floor.  
The third level had a very small second room . . . two turntables and a
microphone.  It felt like someone's basement in there -- and that was a
good feeling.  In what was probably a coat closet area adjacent to this
second room, there was a small television with a Nintendo game playing.  
Interesting personal effect.  This third floor also had a nice, long
hallway, a bathroom and a vendor or two.

In all, I have to say this was the most unique space I've seen since
Crystallized 2 in Lorain, Ohio.  Actually, it reminded a lot of that
party.  Perhaps having a duo of Columbus police periodically roaming the
hallways could have been left out, though -- definitely not party favors.

Article 3 -- "Thou Shall Rock"

Props to Monochrome and whomever preceeded him, but Robert Hood musically
explained to everyone there how and why the top level dj's are considered 
that for a reason.  Almost as soon as his first record dropped, I could
tell the difference.  This wasn't hype at work here.  It wasn't because of
his legendary Detroit roots.  This dj simply felt like he was in control.
He knew what he was doing and wasn't uncertain about a thing.  His set
felt so professional and smooth to me.  Besides the exceptional selection,
he built something out there.  He took the crowd on a journey, up and
down, left to right, and back again.  

As all great dj's can do, Rob Hood's set took me to a place where I could
lose myself and then find myself again.  And it takes more than just
experience for a dj to do that . . . it takes tremendous skill.

So . . . by the time Jay Goodwill came on with his house set, I felt that
I had done my introspective, "deep", self exploring and was ready to just
to bounce around with the more superficial but immensely fun sounds of
fluffy stuff. Thanks, though, to the promoters who were wise enough to
remind us all why Detroit is still revered in Europe as the best techno of
all time.

Article 4 -- "Thou Shall Connect With Humanity"

I've heard the complaint aired more than once that, "These people aren't
here for the music.  They're only here for social reasons."  Well, I come
for the music, but I also come to share my joy with living things.  And
the great thing about ravers is that they are very much alive . . . and
able to reciprocate that positive energy!  Even though I was
hypothetically in a new city -- well literally, actually -- I still knew a
good dozen faces from other parties.  Further, at the net meet I would get
to meet a half dozen more.  Then there were all the happy smiles I got
just from walking down the hall nodding my head to the music.  This is
perhaps why I appreciate semi-lighted chill areas away from the throbbing
bass, namely, it gives you the chance to connect.  I got a little buzz
from every smile I caught and every nod of understanding I intercepted.  
These things take me higher and higher, like the elevating 303 of acid
trance.  And there was plenty of reason to smile at "Motive".  Columbus
might not sport the largest scene in Ohio, but it's certainly one of the
kindest.

Speaking of which, a quick shout out to Benny Haha, Trout, Jade, Hugh (his
first rave), AvantGod, Kerri (the super cutie), Amanda, Erik, StevieT,
Amy, Matt, Mark/Mr. Rab (artist extraordinaire), Beth, Lou, Tim, and of
course the raver formerly known as "geekboy".  Great to see/meet all of
you -- as well as those I left out.
 
Article 5 -- "Thou Shall Sleep"

Well, it was nearing 7:00 A.M. and I had no idea what to do.  I was too
tired to drive back to C-town.  But I was just as unhappy about the idea
of sleeping in my car.  I thought about getting a hotel room, but I
figured that they were going to make me leave by noon.  4 hours of sleep
wasn't worth it.  So what was I to do? Red Roof Inn to the rescue.
Apparently, they have a policy that allows you to stay until noon on
*Monday* as long as you arrive after 6:00 A.M. on Sunday morning.  Ya!!  
So I crashed at the one just off of 71N and slept until early afternoon.  
Then, I enjoyed the rest of the day and early evening in downtown Columbus
-- touring the Statehouse, the City Center Mall and all of the large
buildings I could walk by.

Thanks Columbus!

Yours,

Braden

P.S. Who's with me on Friday at Trilogy for DJ Hardware?

If you live in the city, try to pick us up...although its hard.
(If you have real-audio, check out the broadcast from www.wpts.pitt.edu)

This semester i got a rotation slot, but i still do a mix for
and hour or two.  I'm trying to put together an overall entertaining show,
with tunes all over the musical spectrum - from jazz to surf, triphop to
hardcore, noise-rock to black metal.
  
The mix portion of the show is generally jungle, happy hardcore, or
gabber, with plenty of oldskool tunes along with the upfront bizzness.

Once in a while i'll just go abstract on you and mix-em' all together with
totally random other noises and sounds, just to keep you on your toes.

much of the parking lot.  Since it was midnight and I heard a hard 
bass eminating from the inside, I knew that the event was underway.  
But what was up with that line?>>

tee hee, usually i don't have a problem waiting in line, but nature
wuz knockin pretty hard when we got to the party, so i had to use
my v.i.p. priveledges so i could jet to the bathroom after checkin
in w/ sid @ the door...props to ed for hookin me up on the list this
time...but i think he did it more out of compassion after he found 
out i wuz the one who's car got towed after attending his event on 
thurs!...this was also the reason why i chose to ride to the party 
rather than drive everybody this time (sick of playin chaueffer boy & 
havin to pay for it also!)...

<<It also didn't help that I apparently was one of the only people who 
had brought along food for the homeless -- normally this wouldn't be 
so bad if not for the fact that I had decided to tote along an extra large 
jar of pickles instead of the more traditional can of food.>>

this is too funny, especially since nicole ganked this irregularly large 
jar of pickles from her school cafteria awhile back & we haven't been 
able to get rid of it since!...she even brought it out to one of the ele 
mental day party/picnics @ the park & nobody would touch it!...so to 
this day it still rests on top of our fridge...tee hee, we brought ramen
as our food donation (and i'm sure y'all remember my affinity toward
ramen...hehe... ;P~ )!...

<<I was amazed at the neighborly nature of these Columbus
people.  (I was going to say "Columbus kids", but one of the people I
spoke with turned out to be 43!) >>

tee hee, i bet this was Tom!...Tom is alwaze the designated oldest
dude @ all the columbus partys...the dude that makes the rest of us
old skoo foo's feel a li'l better about our age...hehe, for the longest
time, i thought he wuz ed luna's dad!...

<<So . . . by the time Jay Goodwill came on with his house set, I felt that
I had done my introspective, "deep", self exploring and was ready to just
to bounce around with the more superficial but immensely fun sounds of
fluffy stuff>>

actually the DJ that most impressed me was a local and one of the 
promotors of the party - joe blunt...too bad he went last & too bad
they turned on the lights near the end of his set (how disrespectful!)
...his set wuz very reminiscent of when scott henry closed out the
ultraworld partys back in the day...smooth acidic breaks to bring
in the new day!...

<<I've heard the complaint aired more than once that, "These people aren't
here for the music.  They're only here for social reasons."  Well, I come
for the music, but I also come to share my joy with living things.  And
the great thing about ravers is that they are very much alive .>>

tee hee, i think i'm not social enuff!...often, i'd see kidz i know, but
i'd play loner boy to see what the clue-less newbies would say about
me then i'd come back & compare notes w/ the nearby friend...silly 
mind games...all in good fun...

<<Speaking of which, a quick shout out to Benny Haha, Trout, Jade, Hugh 
(his first rave), AvantGod, Kerri (the super cutie), Amanda, Erik, StevieT,
Amy, Matt, Mark/Mr. Rab (artist extraordinaire), Beth, Lou, Tim, and of
course the raver formerly known as "geekboy".>>

tee hee, shout outs to: ed & sid for hookin me up @ the door, jinx (for
the old skoo chat), walt & sue w/ collective for the drinks, rob & jenny 
(too bad you didn't have a spare beer!), jack & austin of lo-tek (for the 
stupid human tricks!), thomas & tony of exile, jason & jeremy of the 
middle cru, bagel & shell of the urban aboriginals, jonathan & shawn 
oak street kidz, john & spoony from rec shop, anthony from OCI (funny, 
this was the same space for atomic), george & the mt. g cru, the
whitehall cru (for lookin out & throwin the party), miguel of cutting
edge for showing me the 2nd room where his boy rob brown wuz breakin
it down, i think he & cory (kimyon's li'l bro) were the only ones who
got me to dance dat night (actually it's cuz there wuz actually space
up there as opposed to the packed main floor), those mad dancers from
akron by where me & amy were dancin by the speakers, the girl that
fell on me @ locomotive after she did her balloon (she'll be the newest
porn cru initiate, u can ask amy why), the crazy couple dry humpin
behind us when me & amy were sittin in the back (more porn cru
material), those fly girlies sittin on the tables in front of us, one
reminded me of my ex layla & the other of carol of girley girl (both
strippers - depressed me terribly, but still kickin myself for not
talkin to 'em), amanda & braden, two of the few list members i saw,
oh wait, i did bump into steve ford at the end (who tried in vain to
introduce me to kelly & rich), and trouty (who showed me his 
xxx.pornstar.cum t-shirt...tee hee, li'l did u know i wuz wearin my
US Rave Team t-shirt underneath that plaid shirt o mine), eric from
e productions, meeghan from CBS (who i couldn't talk to thanx to
funky!), and one very huge shout out goin out to old skool andy from
dayton who not only drove me & nicole to the party, but also drove
nicole back early & then came back to take me home & then drove
back to dayton!...oh yah, one big boo & hiss goin out to ryan of 
malfunction (our supposed partner for Navigate), who wuz too lazy
to take me home even tho one of the kids he drove lived right down
the road from me (this was especially apalling for me since i used
to drive everybody and their mother to partys & back from as far 
away as toronto, baltimore, louisville, even st. louis!!!...kids these
daze!!!)

...now do u see why i had to stop doin reviews!...all my shout
outs would take up too much bandwidth!

<<Well, it was nearing 7:00 A.M. and I had no idea what to do.  I was too
tired to drive back to C-town.  But I was just as unhappy about the idea
of sleeping in my car.  I thought about getting a hotel room, but I
figured that they were going to make me leave by noon.  4 hours of sleep
wasn't worth it.  So what was I to do? >>

actually u could've hit the after party @ the franklin warehouse,
the after after party @ good dale park, and the afterhours @ amy's
new place sunday night, or u could've even crashed @ my pad (we've 
got a pull out couch bed!)...actually if anybody needs crash space
after any columbus party, just e-mail me privately!...mi casa es
su casa!

For me it's because i have not done everything i wanted to do yet.  I said i
am afraid of dying RIGHT NOW.  That is because if i did, my life would have
been incomplete.

Jason,

  Im not really afraid of dying, because I think when I die I will go
somewhere good. Where-ever that may be. Heaven, higherground, what ever
higher plain exsists...if one does exsist. Im not a religious person, so
it's really hard to say where I will go.

  What I am scared of is the "way I will die". For example Im not scared of
dying in my sleep, but I am scared of someone killing me. That would be
awful...I mean can you imagine getting chased by some crazy man w/ an ax or
something, and knowing you are going to die and that it's going to hurt in
the last few moments of your life. Suffocation ( did I spell that right)
would even be worse. Getting into a car wreck (or any kind of wreck), and
seeing your life flash before you.

  When I die, I just want to die. I don't want to go through chemo, I don't
want to have serveral heartattacks before the one that takes my life comes
along. I just don't want to suffer or have agaony, and the scarey thing is I
beleive that before you die you always suffer from something.

  If you think about all the people that have died ( in my case anyways )
something always fucked up happened that made them die in the first place.
This is what I am scared of. Weather it be cancer, getting shot in the
head...ect ect...know what I mean?

 "Snowstorm"
 
 
 A priest and a nun were lost in a snowstorm. After a
 while, they came upon a small cabin. Being exhausted,
 they prepared to go to sleep. There was a stack of
 blankets and a sleeping bag on the floor but only one
 bed. Being a gentleman, the priest said, "Sister, you
 sleep on the bed. I'll sleep on the floor in the sleeping
 bag."  Just as he got zipped up in the bag and was beginning
 to fall asleep, the nun said "Father, I'm cold."  He
 unzipped the sleeping bag, got up, got a blanket and
 put it on her. Once again, he got into the sleeping
 bag, zipped it up and started to drift off to sleep
 when the nun once again said, "Father, I'm still very
 cold."  He unzipped the bag, got up again, put another
 blanket on her and got into the sleeping bag once again.
 Just as his eyes closed, she said, "Father, I'm sooooo
 cold."  This time, he remained there and said, "Sister,
 I have an idea. We're out here in the wilderness where
 no one will ever know what happened. Let's pretend
 we're married."  The nun said, "That's fine by me."
 To which the priest yelled out, "Get up and get your
 own fucking blanket!"

Hi,
         Why am I scared to die?
         I find it unlikely that conciousness continues after death.  I have
seen no convincing evidence of a soul.  I have seen a lot of convincing evidence
that people stop thinking after they are dead.  (Some people stop thinking
before they die)  I like to exist.  I have, on the whole, found my interactions
with the world pleasant, and I would prefer that they don\'t stop for as long as
they remain relatively pleasant (life support sounds awful).  
         Sorry, I didn\'t mean to depress anyone, but this is pretty clear cut
for me.
           Visualize whirled peas,
                 Paul

peace out all and please contact us if you encounter any problems with
the audio streams. Until we have our RA Server up and running (give us 1
week), our files must start from the beginning. It is impossible to
FastForward and scan thru them, as of now. However, with our new server,
a lot of new software a commin', so don't worry. We'll be higher tech
next week..

peace out..teak

Hi guys, if you had read my past e-mails you would know that i had a lot to
say about the subject of death, but in a nutshell.....i would say live life to
the fullest and try to make the most of the time you have here, but if you
think that this world is as good as it gets and nothing more, than i pity you.
Think of all the things that exist that can't be proven scientifically ( love,
sorrow, happiness...ect) then life or existence after death is just something
that has not been proven...yet
keep the faith...{;-) mark

Hey, are there any other list peeps in the West Virginia
area??

I'm just curious because I'm going to be at WVU in
Morgantown this Saturday
<tomorrow>, and would love to meet some of you kids. <being
that i didn't make
it to the equinox party>

Anyway, Amber, <and whoever else is from WV>, if you and the
rest of the
Morgantown Party Kid Massive aren't busy on Sat, let me know
and we can meet up
somewhere.

I'm going to be at West Virginia University for the Bands of
America Regional
Competition all day on Saturday. It's this bigass marching
band festival for
high school bands and my old high school is going to be
there. <with my 'lil
bro and sis competing>

Anyway, hope everyone has a fun weekend, and WV kids, let me
know! : )

peace,

--spike

Okay, I gotta through my two pennies in on this one... the only thing that,
if I'm not mistaken, that can not be explained through science(love, etc.--
that's the chemicals in the brain that cause emotion) is what makes the
human conscience to begin with.  Scientist know how to alter emotions
through drugs(hell me and alot of people reading this know of more than a
couple of nice ways :]) and all the rest of human workings after
consception, so that explains that.
The only question is now, who/how/why did everyone start having there own
thoughts to begin with.  So that's the only thing that makes me wanna say
there's more out there than what science says.
On death, my experiences(e-mail me if you wanna here my story... it's about
the turning point in my life-I'm still not believing it actually happened
to me-, changed my entire view of what life is), however make me wanna say
that, as much as I don't wanna say it, this is you're one shot in this game
we call life and that's all... I gotta agree w/ mark on this one live to
the fullest you can!

we have complex emotions because we are mammals that are progressing. 
once humans began to stand up (homo erectus), gravity began to modify the
chemistry of our brains.  speech production was enabled this way also.  do
you know of any mammals that stand up and talk?  and don't worry about
those complex emotional systems.  you have compound A in the hot water
pipe, you have compound B in the cold.  your hypothalamus stands there all
day to make your bath just right.  metabolic errors are lime deposits in
your hot water tank.

Cleveland/Akron/Canton/Y-town ravers,

I just wanted to quickly remind you that the CATCHY Job Fair is this Monday
afternoon (October 5th) from 2:00 to 6:30. (Arrive at 2:00 if you are able.) 
It's in downtown Cleveland.

Here are the details:

* The CATCHY Job Fair is taking place Monday, October 5th from 2:00 to 6:30
P.M. at the downtown Cleveland Sheraton Hotel. 

* The Sheraton is located at 777 St. Clair between E. 6th and E. 9th.

* The career fair is in the Grand Ballroom on the 6th Floor.  Business
casual or even casual attire is acceptable.

* Several hundred jobs will be available!  (Full time and part-time too). 

* Please bring many copies of your resume -- 20 to 30 should be enough. 

* It's FREE!

* If you can't find street parking, the most you'll have to pay is $1.50 at
that time of day.  The Municipal lot or the Galleria lot on St. Clair
would be my choice. 

* There will be FREE food like spicy pot stickers, egg rolls, chicken
drummettes, cookies as well as coffee, punch, juice and lemonade.  I know
that you're there for the jobs, but food is a good thing too! 

If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me.  A list of participating
companies is located at the web site (http://www.dezines.com/web/catchy/).

Thanks,

Braden Albert
CATCHY Job Fair

         MODULATIONS

         DIRECTED BY IARA LEE | PRODUCED BY GEORGE GUND

         October 16, 1998
         
         Cedar Lee, Cleveland OH - 2163 Lee Road - 216 321 8232
         
         -----

         We are not entertainers, we are sound scientists -
         Kraftwerk


         From the makers of Synthetic Pleasures, comes the film
         Modulations, a feature-length documentary which captures
         a moment in history where humans and machines are fusing
         to create today's most exciting sounds.

         Modulations traces the evolution of electronic music as
         one of the most profound artistic developments of the
         20th century. By cutting back and forth between avant
         garde composers, Kraftwerk's innovative synthesizer
         drones, Giorgio Moroder's glacial Euro-disco, Afrika
         Bambaataa's electro-funk and Prodigy's current worldwide
         superstarstardom, Modulations celebrates, replicates and
         illuminates the nomadic drift of the post-human techno
         sound.

         The film examines the kids who have turned the turntable
         into a musical instrument, disillusioned disco lovers who
         created acid house out of primitive synthesizers, Motor
         City mavericks who saw the drum machine as their escape
         route out of urban neglect, and a generation of British
         youth who transformed these blips and bleeps into
         dancefloor anthems of their own alienation.

         Modulations provides a sense of history and context in
         which today's electronic music can be understood. It entertains the
         converted and remixes the mindset of electronica's nay-sayers.

         Featuring a stunning collage of interviews, cutting-edge
         visuals, in-studio footage and live performances,
         Modulations moves at a pace that matches the energy and
         innovation of the music.

I just got something from a mailing list about another tricky North
American Tour today.  I was kind of confused 'cause I know he just
toured the US, but evidently he's making another round.  it's wednesday
nov 11th at Metropol.  That's all I know.  This is what I got sent:


TRICKY LAUNCHES U.S. TOUR NOV. 5

Whale To Open Most Dates

  Despite recently catching a nasty form of the fungal infection
candida,
which caused the cancellation of several U.K. and European tour dates,
Tricky will keep his commitment to tour America, along with Swedish pop
eccentrics Whale. The club tour will kick off Nov. 5 in Orlando, Fla.,
and
will continue through the first week of December. 

  Tricky was recently asked by his doctors to take a load off for a full
six weeks to regain his strength and health. Candida is symptomatically
similar to a blood infection, and generally weakens the immune system.
As a
result, Tricky cancelled three U.K. shows and 18 shows throughout
Europe.

  Whale will be touring in support of their sophomore effort, All Disco
Dancing Must End in Broken Bones, which comes out Oct. 6 on Virgin
Records.

Here is the itinerary for the Tricky/Whale tour (Whale joins on Nov. 7):

Nov. 5, Orlando, Fla., House of Blues
Nov. 6, Jacksonville, Fla., Milk Bar
Nov. 7, Myrtle Beach, S.C., House of Blues
Nov. 9, Knoxville, Tenn., Stock Exchange
Nov. 10, Charlottesville, Vir., Trax
_Nov. 11, Pittsburgh, Pa., Metropol_
Nov. 13, New Haven, Conn., Toad's Place
Nov. 14, Northhampton, Mass., Pearl Street
Nov. 15, New York, The Roxy
Nov. 17, Providence, R.I., Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel
Nov. 18, Baltimore, Bohager's
Nov. 19, New York, Eisner and Lubin Auditorium
_Nov. 21, Cincinnati, Annie's_
Nov. 22, Detroit, St. Andrews Hall
Nov. 24, Indianapolis, The Vogue
_Nov. 25, Columbus, Ohio, Newport Music Hall_
Nov. 26, Chicago, House of Blues
Nov. 27, Omaha, Neb., Sokol Hall

This thing about Saturday parties is that you wake up sometime Sunday
afternoon feeling that the whole weekend is gone.  I wake up Saturday
afternoons after a party and I think WAHOO the weekend is still here!
Sunday Night Syndrome kicks my ass.

Yeah, I'm back on.  My roommate's
Ethernet card broke
and took a week to fix.
(I have 300+ E-mails to scan thru)
Then I'll start posting again.

The Hardware set was great, but the location
and lack of PEOPLE sucked.
I felt like shit, and I wasn't into it
that much.  Too sober, I guess.
Plus it was only 11:00-3:00
Oh well, Carl Cox in D.C. next Saturday!
And Keoki, Cirrus, and AK-1200!
Yes!  Roadtrip!!!

Anyway, that's what's been up.
And I'm spinning on 1200s too!
Everyday!  (Thanks Case!)

			Cool!

Well Dave (and all you pb-cle folk)-

I dont know about thurs or sat, but every friday theres a little something
called NATO at a coffehaus in Shadyside called SIP. Started by ED-UMMM of
basskulture fame (kaya years ago) and assorted odd parties throughout pgh,
recently added Dan-Strange (who does the consolidated show on WRCT
wednesday mornings...hip-hop, jazz, and jungle mixed into one super smooth
three hour set) and mskw1 (projekthaus co-ordinator, 1.8.7. video
producer), this event features musik stored on vinyl and assembled via
turntable and mixer for your listening pleasure. Its not quite a club...or
a rave, but it sure is fun. And the coffee ROCKS. SIP is located on Spahr
street, just off of ellsworth in shadyside. NATO occurs from 10pm until
2am, every friday. Oh yeah, if enough peole come who want to dance, they
don't care if you move the tables outta the way (in fact they encourage
it).

Love and mixes-
mskw1

Main Room

Well from 10-12:30 ( think that was the time ) Doug (Doughboy) played. I
love house, so I always enjoy his sets. Then from 12:30-2:?? Lars came on.
Well I thought he was going to suck, but I really thought he was pretty
good. As far as DJing skills...all the mixes were on. Not that I know
anything about skills, but I know a bad mix when I hear one. Anyways...the
music he played was pretty good...housey :-) The only thing I didn't like
was that every other song he played I didn't like for some reason, so once
Id get into one song, he would play a something I didn't like then Id stop
dancing again. This wave went on for most of his set, it was getting
distrubing to me, but then I drank more budlight and it was all good. J/K
but all in all I enjoyed myself and his set.

2ND Room

Alot of hip hop going on back there. I stayed for Intergalatic, but then
left so I could hear more house. I didn't look to see who the DJ was. Wait I
almost forgot I stayed so Ed and I could grind....but that's a secret. :-)~
( Inside joke.....you had to be there I guess ) You see one night there was
a little complaining going on about the whole breakin thing...expecially if
you are trying to dance to let's say umm techno and you have breakers trying
to battle and then kick each others ass, so out of all the places to run
into each other...the hip hop room....ahhh nevermind.

Have fun at whatever you do tonight people!!
Amy

>	Why is everyone so afraid of dying?

well, im afraid of the unknown aspect..i like all emotions in some 
manner, but the thought of the loss of them sucks...also the conscious 
moment when you realize it and all you can think of is "wait, im not 
finished yet" isnt very pleasant either...also, i believe in no forms of 
afterlife, so this might have something to do with it

Viktor told me it's the former lining of the main nuclear chamber at
Chernoble.  They got it incredibly cheap too.  Apparently, it used to be a
lot thicker.  The great thing about it is you can use it as an electric
blanket in the winter.  It'll really keep you warm!  Also, if you shake it
a little bit, it glows in the dark.  It's a true wonder product.

u can also buy it for $15/roll at any hardware store for about 100 x 10
feet. cheap, but effective when trying to manipulate a space.

the chernoble plastic viktor spoke about was a one time special treat :) 

cheers,

>>delete this if you don't have a turntable cause it's just not
relevant to you<<

ok...

i learned something today. and i'm gonna share it with you.
it's about getting your tech 12's set up nice + purty.

1) get a one sided record
2) put it on your tech 12 with the blank face up
3) press start
4) put the needle in the middle of the record
5) adjust anti skating + height adjustment until it will just stay still

i'm saying this cause most people's turntables' settings are ALL
faaaaahcked up. i'll bet you a blow-pop that if you do steps 1-4 right
now with your deck(s) it'll fly off in one direction.

if anyone has better methods, please speak up. i'd love to hear em.

that was soooooo beautiful.  the meet made my nite a 1000 times a 
better.  i had no idea how i was goin to get on stage @ 2.  luckily i 
?found? andy just before he went up and followed.  i prolly met 
everybody, but the dark and the overflow of names and faces has left 
some confusion... and the roll didn't help  %^)

we didn't get away from the main stage though.  that's a shame, but when 
we first checked out the second stage, the sound was pretty low-key so 
we just sat and talked w/ some kids on the chairs.  the main stage dj's 
i caught were: ?who was wearin the white tank?, mogli, ?haliday?, rob 
rage, 7-up (nice touch with the woodstock sample!).  that can't be the 
right order, so please correct (and fill in the blanks %^} ).
Unfortunately, these are the names/faces that i *THINK* i can match.

If anyone's been curious about Toronto parties, this looks like the one to
go to.  A few of the DJs that played at Phunktion are playing at this party
too.  And with the exchange rate Can$25 is about US$16 right now.  So it
sounds like Continuum on Friday Nov 27 and then up to Toronto for Shift.

did you see all of that techno and tech-house?!!  yay!...authentic
excitement is pouring into my dorm room.

chemistry is so gay; why do i have a chem test every fucking monday!? 

i am using my roomates computer; he is in the bathroom.  he is so fucking
weird.  he buys air fresheners and hides them.  the room really smells, i
confront him about it and he's like, "i don't know what you're talking
about".  it is insane.  and he wears tight-ass jelly flip flops from
japan..at night when he is sleeping, i grab them and pretend to fly around
the halls with them...like superman.

well this will set it up for "normal use"....   which i doubt most if not
all 1200s are not used for.
what the tracking does is pull the tonearm towards the edge of the record.
1200s have 3gms tracking, which i dont think is enough for even the
lightest scratching.  look at the vestaxes which i believe have 7gms.  i
dont know the full theory on tracking, nor have i looked much into it, coz
well i cant scratch to save my life!   anyhoo the basic thing is when you
backcue or pull the record back on a scratch, it pushes or pulls the
tonearm one way or the other and the tracking _can_ compensate for it.
another setting thats overlooked/abused is the tonearm height.  its
adjusted from the big ring at the base around the tonearm.
also the pitch and zero pitch is off adjustment alot.  thats a fun one to
adjust.

Yeah, I have to agree Trout.
All that calibration bullshit is for optimal listening, it's more for
audiophiles that it is for Djs.  
In general I have the height all the way up and tracking at 3.  I find
this good for scratching as well as general mixing.
When your mixing you generally do allot of back queueing, if you have
your turntable calabrated with these audiophile tricks your needle is
most likely gonna jump around.
Having the height all the way up and the skaing stuck at max will put
more wear on your records (as well as putting the tonearm weight on
backwards).  For me, I'd rather wear down my record than have my needle
jump around on me at a party.

hi kids, it's me david :) i know i haven't been too active in the pb-cle
lately, and i think my last two posts were attempts to score rides.  so i
apologize for that.

anyways.  to me, the equinox gathering last weekend happened the way they all
should.  it was totally void of useless paradigms.  some kids who love beats
just decided to get together, and they said, "bring your friends."  that's
basically it.  no bullshit.  it made for a very fambleee feel, everyone
sharing not just candy, toys, and cigarettes, but even cars, beds, and hearts.
this was a real party - like, "parteee."  not some industry-based money-making
event; just getting together with friends and friends of friends to be happy
for a while.  so no it wasn't heavily promoted, and i think it turned out
better that way.  

i've only been to a few parties like this - house parties and e parties
included.  there is so much more to my experience, but i'm not really the type
to get breathy.  it was just beautiful.

on the real - 
 david

Hi guys, I don't know about the rest of you but i thought that the net meet on
sat. wuz super.  There must have been about 20 kids there on stage.  I am not
going to comment on the music much because i am still not familiar with all
the d.j.s but the sound from Wizard Work Shop was phenomenal.  I also have to
say that 
7up's set floored me.  I don't think i saw anyone sitting or sleeping during
his set, thanks Dave.  Getting back to the net meet i would like to thank
every one that showed up to make it such a sucess, and also thumbs up to Don
to get us the stage for the meet.  I hope that every one there was as happy as
Hugh and I.  Remember to bring your laminates to the next rave and support the
pg-cle scene.  If we get a large enough group going to raves, we might be able
to get a discount from the promoter. I wished i could have made it to the
after party, but i had to help tear down the sound. If you would like to get a

Dear All

To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration ofHuman
Rights,  Amnesty International is collecting signatures for a pledge
to support this very important United Nations declaration.

Amnesty already has 3 million signatures (real and virtual) worldwide,
and wants 8 million (which would by 1% of the world's population).

The UN Secretary General has already agreed to be present either in
person or live by satellite, if he has to be in New York, to receive
the pledge as a tangible statement of the people of the world's
commitment to an international agenda of human rights.

The most simple way to add your name to the pledge is to:

* Send an email to udhr50th@amnesty.org.au

Put YOUR NAME in the SUBJECT and the following text in the message:

"I support the rights and freedoms in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights for all people, everywhere."

* Forward this message to as many people as you can.

All humanity is involved in a single process, and all men are brothers.
To the degree that I harm my brother, *no matter what he is doing to me*,
to that extent I am harming myself. -MLK

I've been WAY LOST many times trying to get to Buzz. 
The Capital Ballroom is on the corner of Half street and L street. There
are two L streets, but only one Half street, so just make sure you are on
the side of town where half street is. Get a good map. It's hard to believe
that DC is a planned city, unless they were planning for people to get
lost...
Anyway, See you there!!!
Anyone else from the list going to DC?

Well here it is.  I said before I couldnt compare raves because Motive was my
first, but I realized that I cant compare anyways, because this one was a
totaly new experience!  I had a blast, and for those of you that knew my
situation, my night went by soooo fast, which was the only problem.  It was 1
then 6!  7-up totaly rocked the fucking place! The sound in general was sweet,
and the vibe was pretty awesome, except I met up with one shadey as fuck
bitch, but then again I saw her with the same 3 people all night.  MrRab thank
you for introducing me to Tim... an experience that I will not forget.  Shouts
to Matt, for hangin with me all night, and letting me crash at your place
AGAIN!  Benny, Eric..I did remember your name this time! Byron, to god damn
energetic! Jeremy, Amy, Amanda...and the others that I met for the first time,
and cant seem to remember your name.  I think I will be stickin in Cleveland
the next few raves, because hell...I live here and have not gone to 1 cle-rave
yet!  Who is up for Rythem Fri, or Bent Sat....also..is Bent in Kent?
Anyways, peace to all you.  One more thing....I have not really had a chance
to say this, but Pb-Cle-Rave kidz are unified, and are like a family.  I have
noticed that even know some of us are strangers, we meet up, and are welcomed
into the family, which I have been.  I have met sooo many peopleat my 2 raves,
and you guys are the best!  I mean I never realized how many people actually
remembered me from Motive, and said whats up to me as I was passing flyers and
shit...I mean it felt so good!  Anyways...I hope that everyone feels as close
as I do to the Kidz involved in the best list on earth!  peace

Hugh

Moonshine over America was great! I loved the live band.  As usual I was
kind of out of it so I missed the net meet.  Hopefully I will not make
the same mistake at Rhythm.  So if a netmeet is set up for Rhythm let me
know.  I want to meet all of you guys & girls!!!

Its ok. I know I met you but I dont remember you either. :))))

Was it benyhaha (I know don did) that took the net meet photos?  I
would really like to do up a who's who net ravers page or something. 
I am shit with names and faces and usually need to concentrate on the
face for a few minutes befure my facial memory will store it properly.
 And well, thats a bitch and half at raves :)))  If people are worried
about keeping their anonymity then we could do it private like sorta. 
Simple login/password shit and just passaround the password or make
accounts for each other.  

Also on web shit, I was thinking, maybe have a dj reviews page
somewhere.  Like listing what styles they played, if you like that
style how do you think they were, etc.  I *want* to know the djs and
what they play etc, but again, names to faces.  

Ill have a real webserver up in a couple weeks that I can host this
stuff off of. /usr/bin meaning to learn some good web design shit
anyway.  


Turn on, Tune in, Geek out!

As a DC(well, No. Va.) resident, I thought I'd explain DC and addresses:  The 
Capital is at the center, essentially 0 and whatever is before A.  To get an 
address, you need the streets (half and K for Capital city ballroom) and the 
district, IE Northwest, South East, Etc.  Capital Cit is half and K SE, so you 
know it is just south west of the capital(shitty area, too).  Best bet in is 
395, which will dump you directly a block from the ballroom. State streets are 
diagonal, and E-W streets are done by numbers.  N-S streets are done named, 
beginning a,b,c->one sylable A word, and so on.  Actually, I may have confused 
the numbering/naming-can't remember, in cleveland.

get freaked out and am too shy to go up and find you guys...especially 
when I only know a couple of you. At submerged I just couldn't go on 
that stage by myself and i couldn't find anyone I knew xcept Henry and

In one werd Submerged was poopy.........I was tired and sick and unmotivated
and blah.  I totally missed tha netmeet which upset me....When I checked what
time it was, it was already three.  I had pinned my laminate from Motive to
may back pack but it mysteriously dissappeared.   The reason for my bad time
was probably my own stoopid fault.  Tha vibe felt tottaly tha oppisite from
Motive.   My freind getting robbed at gunpoint didnt help either.  To who ever
tha culprit wus...stay tha fuck out ov our scene, that kinda shit is unwanted,
and will not be tollarated!!!!......sorry fer that little peice ov neg their
kidz, that just really upsets me.  Amanda, that little peice ov drug education
you were giving me....I wus kinda out ov it but it sounds like some info that
would do me good....and you seem to know yur stuff...fill me in on all tha
details a drug addict could use to avoid what happened to me at Sub.    
Peace all......Love>>>>>>Avant

Dig a really deep pit in a public park, and cover it over with sticks 
and leaves. Come back the next day and see how many joggers you've 
captured. Keep them alive in there until they swear allegiance to you.
Now you have an UNHOLY ARMY OF JOGGERS!

     everyone else is doing it, so why can't we?

     :P

     name:  the raver formerly known as geekboy
     birth date: 1978
     job[s]: lab rat, private technical consultant,
     web designer, student
     favorite sport[s]: soccer, quake (multiplayer) 
     if you could marry a superstar who would it be:
     well, um, winona ryder is cute, but i might not
     like her
     what is your favorite color: british racing green
     on a 1961 jaguar xks
     what languages do you speak: english, german, c,
     pascal, perl 5
     what is your favorite cartoon: south park makes
     me laugh, the simpsons make me think, the rest
     make me ill, mostly
     would you shave your head for $1k: it wouldn't even
     require thought...
     you could be a star in a tv show for a day, which
     one: television is an indicator of our nations level
     of mass consciousness - and we are collectively 
     pretty stupid - so i don't watch it, so there
     would you go and randomly kiss someone for 50 bucks:
     most certainly
     would you ever kill someone: human life is the only
     constant and one of the few things i truly hold sacred,
     so don't even ask
     do you wear socks to your knees: i would never force
     such a ludicrous fashion statement on my fellow man 
     do you like school: education is important, but 
     institution sucks. it's never taught me much
     a free vacation? where would you go: home
     do you like to fly: i'd _love_ to fly a mig29 or a
     restored hurricane. um, yeah
     do you like rollercoasters: adrenaline is the best
     legal drug. i'm addicted
     do you like to paint: oils are nice but messy, 
     watercolors are too hard-core, acrylics are the best
     compromise
     how many kids do you want: kids are a responsibility
     i don't think i will ever be mature enough to handle
     how many times have you been kicked out of school:
     oh, a bunch. then i got chronically depressed and my
     grades went up
     do you wear a watch: a bulova
     do you have a car: a 1987 mk2 mazda rx7
     have you ever caught a fish: more than i care to recall
     do you like pizza: i'm a geek. the point is completely
     moot
     have you ever been in love: i'm not sure. love is dead...
     do you love someone right now: possibly. if i do they don't
     know about it
     do you have a bf/gf: i'm so elegible it's disgusting. and 
     i like it that way
     if you could win a car what would it be: the caterham super
     seven, special K edition :]
     do you like to drink: not particularly
     do you care about the way you look: other people seem to,
     and i care about other people
     do you believe in ghosts: believe me, doctor, there are 
     times when i have trouble believing in myself
     right or left-handed: right, but with none of the analytical
     implications that usually has
     do you have a good sense of humor: nah
     are you afraid of dying: more than i am afraid of living.
     i've been close to death a couple of times, and she's cold
     and dark and really, really scary. life can be pretty damn
     cool at times, you know
     do you like where you live: as a nomad, it's ok
     do you play an instrument: bass, keyboard, all the brasses
     at one time or another
     where do you live: the sprawling metropolis of pittsburgh
     how long have you been partying: long enough to know that
     i like it
     what's your favorite part of the scene: when you're at a 
     party that sucks, and you're talking with your friends,
     and suddenly the DJ throws on underworld and you run onto
     the floor and start to dance and suddenly everything is
     fuzzy and warm and nice in the world... the music. people
     are just people and they're why the world exists. people
     are more important than the scene. music _is_ the scene

Ok girls & boys.  I'm totally willing to get this t-shirt thing
underway.  I'll act as planner/money organizer/distributor if that's cool
with yall.  I guess we should just see who's design was voted best?  I'll
get prices over the next few days.
How many do we need?  Any idea?

You guys are the first to hear about the wonderful idea Diedre (Sense)
came up with.  She's a photographer, as well as an all around groovy
chic and has donated her equipment and time to take a raver photograph
of everyone the morning after Magick.  She'll be taking it from the
balcony of one of the rooms so that it will be a bird's-eye-view of
everyone who is there in the morning (cracked out cracked out cracked
out).  I want all of you (us) net heads up front!  She's also going to
do a promoter photo and a pb-cle one too.  These will be done earlier in
the chill-out room.  Diedre will be selling these at cost as soon as
they're done.

and the vibe was pretty awesome, except I met up with one shadey as fuck

For all the people who knew that I went with Jen, the bitch is NOT HER!!!!!!!
To tell ya the bitch was an X-X Girlfriend of mine on K, and she was totaly
shady as fuck and could have smacked her, but...then I would be the one giving
off the neg. vibe, and thats what this is NOT about!  She is a good example of
what to watch out for at raves.  So Jenn...sorry for the missinterpretation,
and sorry to anyone else who thought the same.  peace.

Do you mean BC pills?  If you're on pills, you SHOULD NOT be smoking. 
Smoking while on pills greatly increases your chances for certain
types of cancers.  As for Depo and stuff like that, I don't know
(about the risks of smoking).  

As for doing E while on it -- that's fine.  The only thing that can
really make your pills possibly not work are some antibiotics or
certain prescription medicines, which your doctor would tell you about
anyway.  And this only really applies to a few people (although it's
better to be safe than sorry, and it's recommended that when taking
antibiotics you also use a back-up form of BC).

I suggest setting up a website with a voting script and let everyone vote
over a week long period or something... If anyone could setup a cgi one,
that would be great - i might be able to whip up a ghetto little javascript
one though...

I am sooo sorry Hugh-- I played too rough. . . thank you for being so sweet
and apologizing.  I am even humbled into saying, and believing that you
are super cool!  =^P
    Like I said though, everyone who knows me-- knows the truth.
You are a super sweetie Hugh.
XOXO

Hey guys! Hope you are having a beatiful day!
    I am still working on my review of Submerged.  I feel for anyone
who had a bad time there.  Wish you would have found me though
cuz I saw such good, tight energy all night, I would have shared %^)
    The reason for my post is you gotta check out
www.chman.com it is a game called Rave.  It's still
being worked on, but what's there is cool.  If you can't get into
the Rave, let me know and I'll give you a clue.
--But, just think like a raver and you'll be alright.
Enjoy
Jenn

i have a problem with bc pills.. an old gf of mine developed a pulmonary
anureysm while at BOOT CAMP of all places as a direct result of the pill,
so i must say that the entire pharmacology of bc pills is chaotic at best.

     it's in pittsburgh, and that means, in 
     pittsburgh, the city.

     it's being put on by two local djs, tim
     and ted zelch, who are also identical twins
     but refuse to do a tag team and confuse the
     hell out everybody...

     it's $10. at the door.

     sound by don (wizard workshop). lights 
     by randy (electrolyte FX).

     it's a pittsburgh party, what more can you
     say? local massiv, get the hell out, and
     reprazent. out-of-town listkids, get your
     butts over, and be amazed.

     this is just a friday night in pittsburgh.
     the only real way to start your weekend (TM).

     <grin>

     see ya there.

     this weekend started off early. realll early,
     as in like 2am on thursday. for some reason
     i chose an extremely beautiful day to start
     eating stuff while working the night shift at
     the lab, taking off work early, and then 
     spending the rest of the day running around 
     in the sun, the happiest little raver in
     creation...

     note to self: try doing stuff in the daytime,
     a couple more times. it's cool.

     so i was rather dead for atomic, which by any
     account was rather a strange ordeal with tom
     cox spinning a jungle set in the heart of evil
     club-land, metropol, jon spinning nice hard 
     trance pretty much whenever, it seemed, and
     ted doing something wierd with house on the 
     decks. then dave (7up) started spinning house
     with a live singer (!?) and i decided to go
     home. dave? that was strange as hell - but
     entertaining. your mileage may vary...

     i actually accomplished some useful work for
     a client on friday, which is why i probably
     don't remember much of that day.

     anyway, i was going to try and stay away from
     submerged, but it basically came and grabbed me.
     three of my friends were spinning, and i do
     happen to know the promoter, and all my friends
     are going, etc. anyway, so i was going to tag 
     along with kelly (downlow) and ended up riding
     with tim zelch and his friend brian, and complaining
     all the way to columbus in unison that we couldn't
     find any choice cannabis with which to pollute
     our systems...

     not that i'd do any of that shit, mind you.

     anyway, we got to the party around midnight, i
     guess. i was cold and kinda stretched out so i
     said hi to victor (who seemed preoccupied) and
     cut inside like your average party asshole. the
     line was vicious, which had to have sucked, but 
     last weekend at that space was worse...

     so i missed the first set on the main stage,
     which was really nicely set up (the light and
     sound _was_ good in the main room, not surprisingly)
     and actually didn't think nauty grooves set
     was as good as i've heard him spin in his own
     back yard, which is a pity. too clubby, too
     pretentious, by far. he DID play 'born slippy'
     tho and we all ran down onto the floor and
     danced.

     ok, i wanna say something nice or even ambivalent
     about the next two sets, but, nah, they were
     shit. annoying, even. rob rage spun tight techno
     after that, but techno is techno. we needed some
     fucking melody in the house, some bass that we
     could lean into and just plain danceable _music_
     that would get the crowd alive.

     it didn't really happen until dave's speed-garage
     (?!) set. 

     that's basically all there was too this party -
     there was no vibe, it was all paper thin, shady,
     messed up confused kids running around...

     and then dave threw down, and finally there was 
     something there, and then the lights came on, and
     it was all over, time to go home...

     at least it wasn't as short as motive. that lasted
     about as long as your average painful awakening.
     but then again, motive did have a decent set on 
     the main stage in the middle of the party.

     well, anyway. i'd do shout-outs, but to tell the
     truth, the number of people who seem to know me
     at parties, and know me quite well, and the number
     of people whose names i remember _do not_ match, 
     at this point. sorry.

     at one point in the evening i remember thinking:
     "if this were a pittsburgh party, i would quit
      raving. right now."

     i think that was while my friends were getting 
     lost and taking four hours to get there from 
     pittsburgh - but it stands, nonetheless. i wasn't
     too happy.

     too many messed up li'l raver kids. sure, i'm
     not one to talk, but i keep my chemical intake
     in the recreational range, not the 'can't walk 
     or talk' area. i thought i'd seen enough of that
     at motive. anyway.

     <cough>

     that was about it for the weekend, i guess, 
     although it took me a while to get home, kept
     getting distracted. i had more fun being the 'all
     cracked out raver kid' than at the actual party,
     it seems. oh well.

     i think illusions will be a better start to
     the next weekend.

     *hugs*
     'that raver kid with the orange hair'

>Once upon a time, cuz, heck, what better time than that, there lived

>Blow-Pop (tm) out of any raver's mouth.
>
>Well, it seems that Little Red Raver Girls's promoter grandmother was not

>Grandma Promoter to feel better.
>
>Little Red Raver Girl set out into the scary city with a warning from her
>tired out hippy mother, who warned her of the
>evils of the world. As usual it went in one ear and out the other. Little
>Red Raver Girl only wanted peaz and unity and
>didn't like to hear about the bad people out there because they gave off
>such bad vibes.
>
>Hippity, trippy skipping down the avenue whistling some housy, funky toon,
>Little Red Raver Girl hardly noticed the
>Big Bad Gothic Girl come out of the shadows of an alley.
>
>"Whoa!" said Little Red Raver Girl, "You put quite a fright into me!"
>
>"Yeah, whats new?" angrily replied the Big Bad Gothic Girl.
>
>"Hey, you wanna sticker? I got heart stickers!! Or how about a lollipop?"
>asked Little Red Raver Girl.
>
>"Nah, I don't want no stinking lollipop," gothically replied Big Bad

>
>"Well," said Little Red Raver Girl, "i'm off to see Grandma Promoter to
>deliver some goodies so she can be happy and
>throw the phattest event this side of the world."
>
>"Big event eh?" interestingly replied Big Bad Gothic Girl. She thought to
>herself, "Hmmmm....you know I bet if I get
>those goodies I could throw a dark, scary event the way I want it."
>
>"Well, I best be off now. Peace, love and unity to you Ms. Gothic Girl."
>
>"Uhh...yeah, sure."
>
>And Little Red Raver Girl was off. But so was Big Bad Gothic Girl. Seeing

>she happened to know a shortcut to Grandma Promoter's warehouse. She sped
>ahead to beat Little Red Raver Girl
>there.
>
>Little Red Raver Girl continued on her way wondering why someone would

>
>"Yowza!" exclaimed Little Bloo DJ Guy, "Sorry about the bumping action

>
>"Oh excuse me! I wasn't watching where I was going. Would you like a

>
>"Yeah! Sure! Thanks a lot!"
>
>"Here ya go," said Little Red Raver Girl as she stuck on a groovy frog

>"I certainly am! In fact i'm supposed to be spinning later at Grandma

>
>"Yesssss!!! I'm her granddaughter! I'm Little Red Raver Girl! I bet you

>Quite a good guess too seeing as how he had on a bloo hoody shirt with

>
>"Yep! That's me! I'm sooo happy to meet you! Hey, I gotta run but i'm
>going over to Grandma Promoter's Houze of
>Funky Toons for the Pre-Party, so I hope I see you there," said Little
>Bloo DJ Guy.
>
>"You sure will. Be seeing you later!" happily exclaimed Little Red Raver
>Girl. And off went Little Bloo Dj Guy. Little
>Red Raver Girl breathed a sigh, for Little Bloo DJ Guy was sooo sweet and
>just the nicest guy she had met in the
>longest time. She really wanted to hear him spin and get to know him
>better. "Maybe at the pre-show," she excitedly
>thought.
>
>[Meanwhile...]
>
>Back at Grandma Promoter's Houze of Funky Toons, the bass was bumping as
>Grandma prepared for the rave and was
>stressing hard getting ready for the show. Then, all of a sudden a "ding,
>dong, boom boom boom" came from her
>specially designed doorbell.
>
>"Who is it??" asked Grandma Promoter.
>
>"Tis me! Little Red Raver Girl" replied a slightly gruff and not quite
>happy voice.
>
>"I best let her in to help me and cheer her up. She sounds as bad as I
>do!" thought Grandma Promoter to herself and
>opened the door.
>
>As soon as she had in leaped Big Bad Gothic Girl and she quickly tied up
>Grandma Promoter in a extra long pair of
>fishnet stockings and handcuffed her to the sink in the bathroom with her
>handcuff belt.
>
>"You can't do this! It doesn't promote peace and unity!" cried Grandma
>Promoter. "Lemme go and i'll hook you up
>with a hit of X and you can dance all night with us and feel the groove. I
>guarantee you'll feel better."
>
>"Nice try grandma. Stuff it," and Big Bad Gothic Girl promptly crammed a
>black candle into Grandma Promoter's
>mouth to quiet her down. She then went on to change the music to something
>much less happy and got into some of
>Grandma's clothes. "Ick...these are soooo bright and happy. I think i'll
>throw up."
>
>At just about the time she was done there came a sound in the warehouse,
>"ding, dong boom boom boom."
>
>"Yeah, who is it??" asked Big Bad Gothic Girl who was now dressed like
>Grandma Promoter.
>
>"It's me!! Little Red Raver Girl!!" came the reply. "Let me in Grandma! We
>need to change that music and make you
>feel phresh!"
>
>Big Bad Gothic Girl opened the door and let Little Red Raver Girl in.
>
>"Why Grandma! What a pale, icky, clammy white face you have!" said Little
>Red Raver Girl.
>
>"The better to scare you with my dear." came the reply.
>
>"Why Grandma! What morbid, black fingernails you have!" exclaimed Little
>Red Raver Girl.
>
>"The better to scratch off your face with you little happy hippie wanna
>be!!" yelled Big Bad Gothic Girl and she
>LEAPED from her baggies and pounced on Little Red Raver Girl.
>
>Just at that moment the door swung open and in sped Little Bloo DJ Guy
>with his patented Bag O' DJ Music. He
>rapidly threw on the phattest of toons and started spinning and cutting it
>up as best as he could.
>
>As he did this, a strange feeling overcame Big Bad Gothic Girl. She felt a
>pumping bass shaking her body. She felt a
>warmth overcome her entire soul. She wanted to stop almost, but she
>couldn't help herself from getting up off of Little
>Red Raver Girl and dance. She got down. She boogied. She threw massive
>moves. Little Red Raver Girl rushed to the
>john and freed Grandma Promoter. They went out to the dancefloor right as
>a large crowd had gathered at the door.
>
>The pre-party was in full effect and at the heart of it was Big Bad Gothic
>Girl dancing everyone into amazement. She
>gave everyone a hug and some a kiss she felt so good. The vibe was the

Might I suggest 'Phil's Little Musikal Space' found at

http://www.nls.net/mp/prj/musique/

If I haven't reviewed it, just click dat CDNow button. They've got some
really nice prices, and an UNBELIEVABLE selection. (Only place I could
find "Hello Nasty" on vinyl without having to email customer service!)

'sides, if you click that button on my site, i get 7% commission for
every CD you buy there.. of course, it's in the form of gift
certificates for CDnow, but hey! I need more music! don't you? ;)

I like to thank Kelly from downlow for taking the time to send me a few
IGC flyers. Much appreciated!:o) I am looking forward to Magick,
hopefully I can find a ride!

I enjoyed the Little red raver girl story posted by jbrick.Very sweet.
Has anyone read "Rainbow Raver saves the Rave?" Nice little feel good
tale :o) check out http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Club/1029  ,and
/1028 for some happy little pages.

Does anyone know the info line for Impact in Erie Oct.16? Its not on the
pre-flyer. If I can make it back to Erie (I'll be on break from school)
then, I 'd like to go.
pLuR,
Brooke

it out for you.  Vanilla ice.  Raves.  What more is there to say?

Sarcasm: its a way of life.

HOW   SEXY   ARE   YO   SOUNDS? 

"How Sexy Are Your Sounds" article by Sara Finlayson 

Music Style--HOUSE 
Audience: Platinum American Express cocaine crowd. 
Attire: Sophisticated gals in tight-fitting black lycra and open-shirted
fellows sporting gold medallions. Also big
among the gay community where shirts are usually off. 
Motions: Bumping and grinding. Always sweaty. 
Sex Status: Everyone likes to "do it" here. A veritable meat market. 
Get Laid?: 10 outta 10 
                                                                                     
Music Style--JUNGLE/D&B 
Audience: Fed-up ex-ravers and hyperactive Hip-Hop heads. Relatively
young, more popular with girls than most
forms of electronic music. 
Attire: Hip-Hop meets rave goes for a skate and then joins the Army. 
Motions: Flipper-like motions of the hands with a few moves collected
from watching Beat Street. Circle dancer
meets MC Hammer. 
Sex Status: Jungle, like other forms of bass-heavy music, is very sexy. 
Get Laid?: 6 outta 10 
                                                                                     
Music Style--TECHNO 
Audience: Dudes who've been in the rave scene way too long. 
Attire: What I came in. 
Motions: Leaning against the wall discussing why Techno is superior to
every other form of music on the planet. 
Sex Status: Too busy talking about Techno to notice. 
Get Laid?: 3 otta 10 
                                                             
Music Style--HARDCORE/GABBER 
Audience: Tweeked out teens. Predominantly frustrated males. Also
popular with serial killers. 
Attire: Multiple piercings, wife-beater shirts, baggy trousers, and
short hair. 
Motions: Vigorous jumping up and down, pogo'ing, and speaker fucking. 
Sex Staus: Stuck midway through adolescent masturbatory phase. Anxious
and feverish dance style suggests an
urgent need to get laid. 
Get Laid?: 0 outta 10 (only a mother could love these guys) 
                                                                                     
Music Style--GOA/PSYCH TRANCE 
Audience: Crusties and anti-establishment trust fund babies 
Attire: Matted dreadlocks, tie dye, and sandals remain popular. A faint
whiff of Nag Champa is usually evident. 
Motions: Hippie dance style reminiscent of '60s exploitation movies.
Crazy arms motions and rubbery legs usually
point to excessive LSD intake. 
Sex Status: Attractive to each other. Hose down before use. 
Get Laid?: Depends on the phase of the Moon. 
                                                                                     
Music Style--PROGRESSIVE HOUSE/TRANCE 
Audience: University students and candy ravers. 
Attire: 'E' friendly apparel, including fluffy backpacks, glitter,
pacifiers, and anything resembling a Dr.Suess
character. 
Motions: Hands in the air. Eyes rolling back. Occasionally slumped
against the wall. 
Sex Status: No thanks...we're in it for the music. Hugs welcome. 
Get Laid?: Males: 2 outta 10 (too busy trainspotting), Females: 6 outta
10 (they look great...to dirty old men)

I'm sorry that if that post ticked some of you off.  I'm excited!!  I'm not
ashamed to admit what I used to listen or now.   Some of ya'll forget that you
didn't jump outta your mother wearing baggy pants & suck'n on a pacifier.  One
thing that i've learned in  this little scene is to try to appreciate others
differences.  I'm truely sorry if that post upset any of you.  I guess you
would just have to know me and why I do the things I do.
 I have fun no matter what.  It can be the best party ever or an event like
Vanilla Ice.  If one of you posted something about a "NON-rave" related show
or whatever I wouldn't have a fit.  I may not want to know about be there is a
chance I may.  So i hope in the future some of you post things that intrest
you.
Since you feel that Vanilla Ice is   non rave related will you protest the
upcoming party showcasing the Pharcyde?  Looks to be a nice party.
Once again I'm sorry the post was part joke/part serious(cuz I be goin
4real4real).  
But man how can you not be ecited to relive silly memories like Vanilla Ice?
My friends in DC said that they have a lazer with a man doing the RUNNING MAN
& RODGER RABBIT.

Its all about fun...thats why I feel it rave related.

Hey no appology needed.  I joke around, but i'm just being goofy.
I really love Vanilla!  
I've got the original album on vinyl - double copies baby!
If he came to pittsburgh, I'd be there in a second!  (if it was reasonable) 
No sarcasm, really, i would go and sing along! 
Although last i heard he'd become a born-again christian - possibly a 
false rumor.

I once wrote a script for a TV sit-com starring Mr. T, Chewbacca and
Vanilla....it was sort of like a 3-men & a baby meets macgiever (sp?).

People make fun of vanilla ice, and yeah, he is funny.
But no less funny than Master P, or Mace, or Keoki. (opinions of course)

And anyway, isn't "Master P" what its really all about?

when he came to pgh back when he was popular, he play ed @ the syria
mosque, and a holw bunch of people from my (!)elementary school(!)
went and said he only performaed for 20 minutes! and the tix were many
many billz. not that anyone would pay a bunch of money to see him now,
but...

that's funny! my homie sethCRAZYbaum has got ALL THREE of his albums
(and proud of it!!).. the last of which is called "mindblowin" and is
all about smokin' bud. it's hilarious! he is so so so so so so whack.
the pictures on the inside of the jacket are by far the funniest part.
in one he's chillin in the studio, holdin this bag of weed up to the
camera with this look on his face like he's the hardest muthafucka in
the world, and there's less than a NICK in the sack!!!! as my friend
so eloquently stated: "that's wouldn't even get me high!"

yeah - he showed me it. it is entitled "geoff maddock smokes big crack

Hey kidz :)The HoUsKiTteN is back. I hope I haven't missed too much. As 
the story goes, my roommate has taken *forever* tog et our computer down 
here (now she finally has it in our apartment, but it is yet to get up 
and running) and I am SICK and TIRED of waiting, so I have taken matters 
into my own hands. I'll be using this hotmail addy for the time being, 
hoping that my AOL can get loaded on the computer at some point in time 
(hey now, I know some of you out there hate AOL, but it lets me keep in 
touch with people since I cannot load an ICQ program on these school 
computers). ANYWAYS- it's good to be back, I've missed the list. This 
party kid is still kickin' despite the academic and work load weighing 
me down and aside from the fact that my "party world" has just about 
come to a crashing end in Cincy. (long story) But C'est la vie! (sp?) I 
shall overcome ;)

Just a quick comments/questions:

Don't some people on here compose Product 19 if I am correct? If so, it 
is IMPERATIVE that you get in touch with me. I have something to ask you 
if I am thinking of the right crew :)

Thanks so much...

'til next time...the ressurected HoUsKiTteN >^··^<

I realize this is a stretch, but is anyone going to Physics of 
Electronica II in Nashville October 17th? A lot of my friends are 
involved, so I was just wondering if I was going to see any familiar 
faces...I realize it's quite a trek for most of you.

Please disregard the plea for Product 19...for some un-God-forsaken 
reason I had him confused w/Circuit 6...sorry guys ;)All this time away 
and all this Greek literature I have been reading has been getting to 
me. ANYWAYS, I think someone has taken care of issuing the message I had 
to give anyways. I appreciate it :)

Pittsburgh this Friday would be willing to take some " Barely Legal"
flyers down there for me and pass them out? I will hook whomever up with
a ticket to the party on the 16th.

Excerpts from mail: 6-Oct-98 Re: {pb-cle} Ice Ice Baby!!.. by "Michael
Stuart"@email.u

> hits...
> mike - edisc

He lived in miami when he recorded that stuff but he grew up or at least
went to high school in Carollton TX (a suburb of Dallas).  You could see
him in the year book.

I was on a date in high school at this restaurant in Dallas that my
friend worked at.  She grabbed us and took us to the large private table
in the back.  Vanilla Ice was in there with his girl friend and family. 
All the waiters kept comming by and singing ice ice baby to him.  One
was dancing.  Vanilla was like "leave us alone guys."  It was great! 
All this was like a year after his big fall.

That was an awesome script.  Specially the part where he does his kick, and the shoe

Submerged Review:
Shouts out to Victor who threw a great party.
I keep hearing it was a bit shady in areas, I am really sorry to hear
that, but really glad I didn't see it.
I suck at reviews in general, but here goes my attempt.
As far as music goes, I can only comment on what I saw, which happens
to be the last three DJs on the main stage.
-I really enjoyed Dave Hollands set. Starting out with a harder house,
moving to
and then thru techno always does it for me.  Especially when it's done
right, with tight mixes.
I saw so much energy pouring out of him while he played I got goose
bumps.  He definitely does
good things for the scene.  I got to chat with him a bit after his set,
props always need to go out to real people.
He deserves them--He is going to be helping us out at Fame with an event
we're throwing to help Cathy Frank.
She's 24 (I think) and has MS.  She had a heart attack the other week
because
she couldn't afford her meds.  I get sad every time I think of it!  She
really has no family,
from what I have heard, she's basically all on her own!  Look for Dave
Hollands coming soon,
he'll be at this event.  I am still working on a date that won't
interfere with anybody else's party.
Unfortunately, this was sorta thrown upon us, and I can only work with
what comes my way.
I'll get the 411 out as soon as I can.  In the meantime, any help or
suggestions
would be appreciated.  I ramble, so forgive me-- back to my review--
Rob Rage, WOW made my night so much better.  There wasn't much room to
go after DHollands
set.   I love the way good techno just gets into my head and fucks it
all up.  This did.
Then 7up, mad props boy!  He had the whole house dancing. Earlier in the
evening I was walking
around the dance floor and literally tripped right over someone sitting
there.  I just can't comprehend that-
there are many places to chill- especially in this venue- why make the
dance floor one of them?--
back to 7up- he played a great set.  Even after the lights came on,
people kept dancing!  Amazing!
Unfortunately, this is all I can comment on as far as DJs.
I had such a groovy time dancing though, I love it when the music just
consumes my will
and takes control of me and makes me dance.  Smiling just thinking of
it!!  This was one of those parties.
I really didn't go anywhere other than the main room, and the hallway to
pass out fliers.
and I'm sorta salty I missed Eric D's set. . . from what I heard he and
Dave Breakwell were tagging,
and Jeremy was hiding somewhere under the tables MCing.  Did anyone see
this?
I am so disappointed with myself for missing what seems to me--funny
shit!!
Oh well- to a subject that pisses me off--
I kept hearing about some guys with a gun.  BAD BAD BAD!  Go away.  If
anyone is
ever confronted, or having troubles at a party, please find me- ASAP.  I
can only do what I can-
but I know a lot of mean, big, burly guys who will NOT tolerate such
nonsense in our scene.
My suggestion, find your warmth and bE thErE.  Dance, laugh, play, do
what you must. . .
just be smart and realize where you may be wondering around to.  Cuz,
unfortunately, there are
some real losers out there who enjoy taking from wonderful, beautiful,
loving ravers such as yourselves.
Back to the flip side, I had a really great time at this party.  I can't
wait to see the pictures, mine pry won't turn
out though cuz my massage oil opened inside my bag, and well, my camera
was in there too.  Messy, to
say the least.  Although sure does smell good.
Shouts out to too many people--Hugh, you are such the sweetie, thanks
for driving, Matt
(ratfink)-- you know you the best, bEnny-big hugs and tons of lovin'
smiles your way, Mike-glad you enjoyed
the glow sticks, hope your sister had fun--find me at bEnt if you're
going, Mark the printer-THANX!-those
stickers are the bomb!, Kelly-finally, a face with the name, and to too
many people I forget
names-faces-names-we all know that game! I SUKK-forgive me.
It's really cool to see a communitE where there is soo much love.  You
guys are the best.
Jenn

SUBMERGE REVIEW

massive kudos to viktor & "darryl hannah" (inside joke)...one can 
easily sense the love & energy these two have when they work 
together, they truley live up to their production cru name "two 
tigers!"...

SPACE 

not quite as crowded as Motive, had enough room to make a fool
of myself in the circle (i backrolled into a handstand stall, which
was supposed to go into donkey kicks, but i had already clipped
somebody going into the stall & decided to bail rather than do
more damage)...i let my protege, nicole & breaker john take over!

SOUND

props to don from wizard workshop for a job well done

MUSIC

we walked in & were impressed w/ the selections of Naughty
Groove, but it was definitly Mr. Hollands that was the high
light of the evening...the man who helped kick off the kentucky
scene when he helped J-squared throw his first big party
Skew & the man who headlined for one of Collective's earlier
party's Return of Superfly, blew away the techno heads with his 
hard drivin east coast style...despite his columbus veteran status, 
rob rage quickly found out mr. hollands was quite a difficult act 
to follow, nevertheless the circle dancers gave respects by 
throwin down some of the most fluid moves...even heads crom the 
CBS cru were representin!...and before they could take a breath, 
7UP jumped on the wheels of steel and dropped dat same crazy 
ghetto house track that josh wink spun @ red zone awhile back
...kids were goin nuts!...dave, who used to live w/ my ole roomie
mike fifer, has definitly improved since the last time i saw him
in cleveland!

THE PEOPLE

finally got to meet kelly downlow thanx to steve ford! (happy 
rich wasn't around to kick my ass)...props to mark for the dope 
badges!...had fun meetin all the net heads @ the meet on stage
@ 2am...thanx to jenn who helped me find my friend amy m...
finally got to meet stephanie, columbus cutie...oh yah, player
of the week goes to jack (funkdoktah)!...michael mccusty & i
had a wonderful time talkin to his new girley from colorado
(i was extra shocked to find out she was born in the same
hospital i was - st. elizabeth's hospital in youngstown!)...but
more than anything i think i missed my best buddy amy funkybizz
(who decided to skip cuz she was too pooped from dj lars @ the
red zone the night before)...bumped into jonathan & J.R. upstairs 
near the ele mental sound system...and was finally able to drop 
some floor moves up there, but was too outta practice to do much 
else...before we took off, ed slipped me a "real" Submerge flyer 
that he had printed up for Submerge Records in detroit...

ick, i'd write more, but i think i wanna do more research again,
y'know, help "change things or something bad will happen"...

Ok, here is a hack alternate ending to that Red Raver Hood Story.
Needless to say I don't like it quite as much, but it is kinda funnE!
You can send props or complaints to Kelly "Big Bad Goth Girl" Ashkettle @
kellya@avotar.com
plur,
jbrick


------------------------------------------------------------------
>As soon as she had in leaped Big Bad Gothic Girl and she quickly tied up
>Grandma Promoter in a extra long pair of fishnet stockings and handcuffed
>her to the sink in the bathroom with her handcuff belt.

*If you want the Big Bad Gothic Girl to win, turn to page 13*
[flip, flip]

Grandmother Promoter found a strange sensation creep over her as she
realized that she was being held captive. "Ooh, baby! Tie me up! Spank
me!" panted Grandmother Promoter. 

"If you are a good slave, there will be time for that, but first I must
prepare to make this a dark, scary event the way I want it," replied Big
Bad Gothic Girl.

She then went on to change the music to something much less happy.  At
just about the time she was done, there came a sound in the warehouse,
"DONG. DONG. DONG." 

Big Bad Gothic Girl opened the door to let in Little Bloo DJ Guy.  "Woah,
I've never heard any beats this deliciously morbid!" he exclaimed. 

"I can see you need some help earning your name, blue DJ," said Big Bad
Gothic Girl. She opened her CD flip file. "You're listening to The Sisters
of Mercy," she explained. "And this is Siouxsie and the Banshees. And
this..."

Little Bloo DJ Guy began to sway back and forth. He lost his silly grin
and put on an expression of intense brooding. He raised his hands above
his head. He tried to change a lightbulb that wasn't there.

Soon, he had taken Big Bad Gothic Girl's CDs from her hands and busied
himself with trying to beat match Rosetta Stone with black tape for a
blue girl. 

Big Bad Gothic Girl went out to the dancefloor right as a large crowd had
gathered at the door. People looked at each other in confusion at the
music Little Bloo DJ Guy was playing, but when he put on Covenant they
started to bop around.  They began to look confused again as Bloo DJ mixed
from The Cruxshadows to Faith and the Muse, but then they looked at Big
Bad Gothic Girl, who danced them all into amazement.

She twirly-spun. Her hands were moths, fluttering in the light from the
candles she had lit to increase the room's dramatic impact.

"Hey, she's doing trancey moves," they whispered. They began to move their
arms around above their heads, too, and before they knew it, they were
moping the floor to The Cure's "Disintegration."

Later, Big Bad Gothic Girl untied Grandmother Promoter, who got out her
riding crop and spanked anyone who asked.

The darkness was the most intense they had ever felt that night. Little
Bloo DJ Guy spun an amazing gothic set and fell deeply in love with Big
Bad Gothic Girl.

Little Red Raver Girl was later discovered to have fallen off a cliff. All
the ravers wore black to her funeral, and they liked it so much they
decided to wear it from then on.

And they lived gothily ever after.

here's a clip from an interesting article about quite a notorious
"hood" way back in the day...bumpy johnson, who's color forced
him into the underground...

==========( begin clip from THE SOURCE dec 1997)==========

KING OF HARLEM

The Legacy of Bumpy Johnson by Karen E Quinones Miller

He was called an old-fashioned gentleman and a pimp; a
philanthropist and a thief; a scholar and a violent thug;
a man who lectured children on the benefits of education,
and a man that some say introduced heroin into Harlem.
Bumpy Johnson's contradictions are still the root of many
an arguement in Harlem.  But there is one thing on which
both his supporters and detractors agree: in his lifetime,
Bumpy Johnson was "the man" in Harlem.  He is best known,
of course, as the man who fought to keep the notorious
Dutch Schultz from taking over the Harlem numbers racket,
as dramatized in the recently released movie, HOODLUM.
   Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson was born October 31, 1906,
to a middle class family in Charleston, NC.  His father
was a manager at a "Negro" bank in town and sent the boy
to an exclusive private school, where he excelled.  Between
1916 and 1919-the date is in dispute-Johnson was sent to
live with his sister in New York where he was to continue
his education.  But when a job he applied to was given to
a lesser-qualified candidate, who happened to be white,
he turned to a life of crime.  "Thats when I realized it's
the same all over the country when it comes to coloreds
and whites."  Bumpy said later in life.  "Whites pass
everything to other whites and just throw the crumbs to
coloreds-or rather to the coloreds that bow and scrape and
act like nice colored boys. And I ain't nobody's boy.  I'm a
man, and I'm going to get mine like a man."
   a federal prosecuter ince called him the most dangerous
man in New York City, but many people in Harlem, to this
day, call him a hero.  Like Bumpy, many of them arrived in 
Harlem filled with dreams of getting a good education and
a lucrative career, only to find out that in reality, their
dark skin closed as many doors in New York as it did in the
Deep South.  Most people decided to stick it out and try to
succeed honestly, but they still sympathized with an
intelligent and engaging man like Bumpy who refused to
play the "white man's game" with rules designed to ensure
failure.

Ok, if yer looking for something to do in Pittsburgh the night before
MAJICK, check this out.  I will be there and should be fun to see a
variety of costumes and you may get some cool last minute ideas for the
big show the next day. :)

plur,
jbrick
---------------------------------------------- 
Masquerade II: the Return of Halloween at Ceremony will be held at
Club Laga on Friday, Oct. 30 from 7pm-2:20 am. Cover will be $10 all night
long, and re-entry will be allowed.

There will be giveaways from Cleopatra and Projekt, free candy, drink
specials, and tarot card readings. Randy's is conducting a gothic photo
contest and will be giving away prizes for that, and Punk Ass Gear will be
on hand selling shirts, stickers, etc.

The rough order of events for the night is as follows:

_______________________________________
*DJ -brian
-Crayon Death
*DJ KellyA
Hot Topic fashion show
*DJ Kelly D
-Mace
-Mindless Faith
awarding of prizes for best costumes
-The Deep Eynde
*DJ Salo
_________________________________________

The Deep Eynde are a "gothic cabaret" style band from L.A. with a sound at
times similar to The Cruxshadows. They appear on Cleopatra's "Goth's
Undead" compilation, among others.

If you haven't visited The Deep Eynde's home page yet, go check it out at
http://www.jps.net/deepeynde/
The live photos page is beautifully designed and quick loading, and will
give you a great idea of what you're in store for when you see them live.

This is definitely a band for Halloween.

Also, please note that The Deep Eynde will be traveling with a Fox News
crew doing a documentary on the goth scene, so you could be on TV!

Has anybody seen the movie Cool as Ice?  I once played a drinking game
where a bunch of us watched this movie and did a shot of tequila every time
Vanilla Ice did something "cool."  (We got drunk really quickly.)  The
classic line is: "Ditch the zero and get with a hero."

i love the first track off of Synthetic Pleasures, "Over and Out"

"Thank you very much God over and out...
  There's a whole universe out there Steve, totally unheard of,

  Anything else over?...
  That's all for now Jim, over.

This one takes you to a long list of DJ sets, 
and the name of each record spun.
(Artist, title, and label.)

And for you lazy fucks, here's Astralwerks.

I liked this site cuz it's got Real Audio and Video
of Fat Boy Slim (yes!)
and stuff.  I think photek, too.

I've tooled around with the demo
version of Rebirth before.  Is the
full version of Rebirth 2 good
for fledgling DJs like me?
Any comments/reviews?

And does any Joe know the record
where the lady sings
"Iiii'm horny,   I'm horny horny horny..."
I think it gets really annoying,
but it's stuck in my head.

The MW-Raves Weekly Event Calendar
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/calendar

82 events, 16 new and 7 updates
...brand new look, same great price!

==

It's now a set of lynx-friendly web pages that allow users to:

   o   Get information on the calendar, mailing list or
       submission guidelines

   o   Browse, view, download or e-mail various versions of the
       calendar as hypertext, plain text or PDF

   o   Submit information for upcoming events using
       a form they can fill out online, or by e-mail

   o   Subscribe or unsubscribe to the mailing list

The weekly mailings that go out on the calendar mailing list have
been shortened as a summary.  You get the list of all the names and
dates, but only the upcoming two weeks' worth of e-flyers.  A link
at the top of the file takes you to the website, or the message can
be replied to and an autoresponder at hyperreal will automatically
e-mail you the full-length version.

This new format will not only make more efficient use of resources
but allow more flexibility and ease-of-use for everyone.  Please
check it out and let me know if you have any problems or suggestions
(I'll be out of town until the 14th so I'll get back to you then).

No Shit! I've heard that one at several parties, and it
always winds up playing in my brain for days after. Wasn't
it the last song Sleepy C played at Phorm? Title anyone?

I do know ReBirth 1.5 was a great little tool for layng out the basic
tracks of the music (it's what I have been using for about a year). 
As for 2.0, I will have myself a copy in approximately 2 weeks so I'll
be sure to post my reaction to it.  I assume it will be great because
the guys at Propellerhead Software really have there sh*t together.

synthvortx@aol.com doesnt like the way i run the rom and says hyperreal is
a joke and is concerned about the state of the rom with the beastie boys
and front 242 listed on it.  comments to trout@hyperreal.org

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events, just testing this out and we'll see what the
reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

Fri Oct 16                    MODULATIONS MOVIE                   Cleveland

         MODULATIONS

         DIRECTED BY IARA LEE | PRODUCED BY GEORGE GUND

         October 16, 1998
         
         Cedar Lee, Cleveland OH - 2163 Lee Road - 216 321 8232
         
         -----

         We are not entertainers, we are sound scientists -
         Kraftwerk


         From the makers of Synthetic Pleasures, comes the film
         Modulations, a feature-length documentary which captures
         a moment in history where humans and machines are fusing
         to create today's most exciting sounds.

         Modulations traces the evolution of electronic music as
         one of the most profound artistic developments of the
         20th century. By cutting back and forth between avant
         garde composers, Kraftwerk's innovative synthesizer
         drones, Giorgio Moroder's glacial Euro-disco, Afrika
         Bambaataa's electro-funk and Prodigy's current worldwide
         superstarstardom, Modulations celebrates, replicates and
         illuminates the nomadic drift of the post-human techno
         sound.

         The film examines the kids who have turned the turntable
         into a musical instrument, disillusioned disco lovers who
         created acid house out of primitive synthesizers, Motor
         City mavericks who saw the drum machine as their escape
         route out of urban neglect, and a generation of British
         youth who transformed these blips and bleeps into
         dancefloor anthems of their own alienation.

         Modulations provides a sense of history and context in
         which today's electronic music can be understood. It entertains
         the converted and remixes the mindset of electronica's
         nay-sayers.

         Featuring a stunning collage of interviews, cutting-edge
         visuals, in-studio footage and live performances,
         Modulations moves at a pace that matches the energy and
         innovation of the music.

in association with
CIRCLE, SONIC SOUL, and 2-TUFF

Saturday November 28 1998
Washington DC prepares to
 
E  N  E  R  G  I  Z  E

Thanksgiving weekend, Ultraworld will present the most 
spectacular event in its 6 year history. It will be held 
in the massive DC Armory, and while there have been four 
previous events in this space, none will compare to the 
spectacle of Energize.

The main arena of this space has over 100,000 sqft of 
wide-open wooden floor, but what will set Energize
apart from our previous events is that we will make use
of additional space in the basement! The basement has
40' ceilings and is the same size as the main floor but
divided into three massive sections. For the first time 
at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all 
with full on concert level production in both sound and 
lighting.  


>>The Main Floor:

Ultraworld will fill this space with the best sound system they
have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of 
lasers, projection screens and intelligent lighting. Appearing
On the main floor:

Exclusive live performance by 
CARL CRAIG as Paperclip People (Planet E, Detroit)

with DJs
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI (Matsuri Productions, London/Tokyo)
DOC MARTIN (Tight, Los Angeles)
DJ ICEY (Zone, Orlando)
SCOTT HENRY (Buzz, Washington DC)
T-1000 (Generator/DJax, Detroit)
NIGEL RICHARDS (611 Records, Philadelphia)

 
>>The Drum N Bass arena:

In one of the basement areas, Ultraworld and 2-Tuff are 
proud to present a selection of the best Drum 'N' Bass talent 
the US has to offer, alongside two of the originators of the
UK scene. In the d'n'b arena:

GROOVERIDER (Sony/Prototype, UK)
FABIO (Creative Source, UK)
MC GQ (the UK's premier MC)
DARA (Breakbeat Science, NYC)

DB (Breakbeat Science, NYC) 
SLANT (2 Tuff, Washington DC)
ENTITY (Ultraworld, Baltimore)
FLUID (Sonic Soul, Baltimore)

>>The House arena:

This second basement area is bigger then any dance club 
on the East Coast. It will be hosted by Philadelphia's
Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long.

main room at most clubs! This room will be hosted by Baltimore's
Sonic Soul, America's premier chill-out crew. You can dance if you 
want to...

opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low price. 
However, these 1000 tickets will only be available
at Modern Music in Baltimore, Musicnow in Washington
DC, or by mail order. We are accepting orders for these
tickets now. If you'd like to mail order your ticket, 
send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER ONLY, made out to Ultraworld

price up to and including the day of the event at the
ticket outlets. Admission at the gate will be $35.
For your convenience, tickets will also be available 
through Ticketmaster for those who don't have a ticket
outlet close-by.

Also, We are working with the Buzz crew to make this an 
extended weekend. For those of you who may not know, Buzz 
is DC's premier club event, held every Friday by DJ's Scott
Henry and Lieven De Geyndt. It plays host to the world's top 
DJ's and live acts on a weekly basis. When you purchase

the place to be is Washington, D.C. for Ultraworld's ENERGIZE!!!

It's from the onion: www.theonion.com
I you go there, look in the archives for:
"U.S. Techno- industrial base eroding due to foreign competition". That's a
good article, too. 
Everyone has to check that site out, though. It's funny as hell!!!

It was _orginally_ from the onion, although they don't have it available
online... So, on September 15th, I put in on ravedata
(http://www.ravedata.com/) under the news... thinking people would enjoy
it.. obviously, they have.. it has been circulating all around regional
lists everywhere for like two weeks now... :)

see, this is my opinion of this rave...as long as it goes on and there 
is functional sound, it will be better than anything else going on that 
night........i dont even know how much it costs or anything else about 
it...i dont even care who else is spinning other than mastervibe and 
clarkee....

 up my schedule.

=46AVORITE SPORT(s) TO PLAY:  hmm, volleyball maybe?  basketball is ok too,=
 but i would say skiing and skateboarding are the overall favorite outdoor=
 athletic type things, if you consider them sports you can "play"

IF YOU COULD MARRY A SUPERSTAR WHO WOULD IT BE: i don't know...i can't think=
 of any just off the top of my head.  problem is you never really know any=
 of them, so how do you know which one you'd want to marry over another?

DO YOU SPEAK SPANISH: no

DO YOU SPEAK GERMAN: no

DO YOU SPEAK FRENCH: that's debatable...i've taken enough classes in it, but=

 iron dragon and the gemini at cedar point, but beside those, i just don't=
 feel comfortable even getting on them.

 frustrates me quickly, cuz i can never get what's in my head onto the canva=
s.

budgit mi ass :P

well, yah, i'm onna budget, but i wasn't when i bought mine. i spin with
'em because they are actually hard to spin on. 

you wanna get GOOD at spinning without all those stupid fancy twiddlez?
get a pair of 1200sl's, and learn how to do everything you can do on a
mkii with them. using all the mkii's annoying features. if you can do
that, then you are officially GOOD at spinning.

The Masturbata
 (sung to tune of the Macaraena) by Adam Sandler

       Sitting in my house, and I know that I'm alona,
       Feeling kinda horny, got a jingle in my bona.
       Go and grab a Penthouse it's the one with Sharon Stona.
 Hey
       Masturbata!!
       I go a little faster and its feeling kind of nicea,
       Once ain't quite enough so I have to do it twicea.
       If you wanna spank the monkey I can give you good advicea.
 Hey
       Masturbata!!
       I use some baby oil or a little Vaselina,
       Laying down a towel so I keep my carpet cleana.
       Never shake my hand cause you don't know where its beena
 Hey
       Masturbata!!
       I do it in the car when I'm driving down the streeta,
       One hand on the wheel and the other's on my meata.
       I can't get out the car cause I'm sticking to the seata.
 Hey
       Masturbata!
       Since I was a kid I have been a Masturbata,
       choke the chicken, hum the knob, squeezing the tomata.
       I've looked at Ms. November now I'n gonna decorate her.
 Hey
       Masturbata!
       Buffing the banana, Mr. Lizard shaking bacona,
       Pounding on the flounder and its mayonnaise I'm makinga.
       Spank the frank, wax the carrot, god my hand is achinga.
 Hey
       Masturbata!


        Now send this to as many people as you can for lots of laughs!!!

On Saturday November 28, 1998, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend,
Ultraworld will present the most spectacular event in its 6 year history.   It
is called ENERGIZE, and that is exactly what we intend for it to do to the
dance music scene on the East Coast and beyond.  It will be held in the
massive DC Armory, and while we have done 4 events in this space before, none
will compare to the excellence of Energize.

The main arena of this space has a legal capacity of 12,000 in one wide-open,
high-ceilinged, wooden-floored expanse, but what will set Energize apart from
our previous events is that we have now been approved to use the basement! 
Don't think basement like dark and dingy though, this basement has ceilings of
40', and makes the biggest dance clubs on the East Coast look like efficiency
apartments in Manhattan.  Plus it's divided up into rooms of various sizes. 
For the first time at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all
with full on concert level production in both sound and lighting.  

All performers listed below are confirmed.  The four rooms of Energize will
be:

The Main Arena:   We will fill this space with the best sound system we have
ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of lasers, projection
screens and intelligent lights.  The lineup is one of the best we have ever
presented, a true blend of the most prevalent styles of electronic dance
music.  From hard techno, to trance, to funky breaks, to fun party music, the
main room at Energize is going to be all that and more.  The performers are:

CARL CRAIG performing live as
Paperclip People  Planet E Records, Detroit
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI  Matsuri Productions  London/Tokyo
DOC MARTIN  Los Angeles
ICEY  Zone, Orlando
SCOTT HENRY  Buzz, DC
T1000  Generator/DJax, Detroit
NIGEL RICHARDS  611 Records, Philadelphia

You may have seen that Uberzone was previously listed in the main room.  They
had said they were available, but then decided to cancel all bookings for the
rest of the year to make time to write new music. 

The Drum 'n' Bass Arena:  In one of the basement areas, we are proud to
present some of the best U.S. drum 'n' bass talent, along with the undisputed
champions of the U.K. scene.  This area will be hosted by 2 Tuff productions
of DC.  The lineup is:

GROOVERIDER  Sony, Prototype, U.K.
FABIO  U.K.
MC GQ  the U.K.'s premier MC
DARA  Breakbeat Science, NYC
DIESELBOY  Platinum, Philadelphia
AK1200  Orlando
DB  Breakbeat Science, NYC
SLANT  2 Tuff, DC
ENTITY  Ultraworld
FLUID  Sonic Soul, Baltimore
MC DUB2  Philadelphia

The Deep House Arena:  This third area, also in the basement, is bigger then
any dance club on the East Coast.  It will be hosted by Philadelphia's Circle
crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will keep the househeads groovin'
all day long.  The performers are:

DERRICK CARTER  Chicago
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION  Universal Language, U.K.
FEELGOOD  Charm City Records, Baltimore
KENNY GLASGOW  Toronto
O'KEEFE  Circle, Philly
ROB PAINE  Circle, Philly
SEAN THOMAS  Circle, Philly

The Chill Out Arena:  The smallest area of the event, but still bigger then
the main room at most clubs!  This room will be hosted by Baltimore's
respected Sonic Soul crew, and will feature the downtempo side of electronic
music.  You can dance if you want to, with performers:

TIM "LOVE" LEE  Tummy Touch, U.K.
PETE LAWRENCE  the Big Chill, U.K.
WE performing live  Asphodel, NYC
LOVEGROVE  Sonic Soul
DJ C  Toneburst, Boston
RHOMBUS  Sonic Soul

What makes this event even more exciting, is the fact that it will be a
collaborative effort between Ultraworld, Circle, 2Tuff, and Sonic Soul.  While
Ultraworld will be the main organizers and provide the direction for the
event, these other three crews will be involved to specifically manage the
areas of music they are most interested in.  What that means for you is that
you get the highest quality of production and care going into every aspect of
the event.

Tickets will be on sale in the DC/Baltimore area on September 30, and should
be at all of the outlets by October 3, and will be broken down as follows:

There will be 1000 tickets sold for only $20!   So if you know you're going to
go, you have the opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low price.  We are
accepting orders for these tickets now, or you can wait until they are at the
outlets. If you'd like to mail order your ticket, send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER
ONLY, made out to Ultraworld Productions for $20 per ticket ordered.  Send it
to:

Ultraworld Productions
3042 O'Donnell St
Baltimore, MD  21224

After those 1000 are gone the price will be $25 up to and including October
31.  

On November 1st, the admission price goes to $30, and will stay at that price
even the day of the show, at the ticket outlets.  Admission at the gate will
be $35.

be able to purchase tickets through them.

TICKETMASTER  800.551.7328


Also, we are working with the Buzz crew to make this an extended weekend.  For
those of you who may not know, Buzz is DC's premier club event, held every
Friday by DJ's Scott Henry and Lieven De Geyndt.  It plays host to the world's
top DJ's and live acts, and the DC scene in general is one of the best in the
country.  When you purchase your ticket to Energize, there will be a stub
which will allow you to come to Buzz on Friday night for only $5  (Note:  
Tickets purchased through Ticketmaster will not have this stub, but Buzz will
honor the $5 admission).   Consider coming to DC on Friday, and making a long
stay of it.  We'll post hotel and travel info on this site in the weeks to
come.

Does anybody know where Rhythm is going to be at?  The info line doesn't
say anything yet.  Also let's set up a net meet for that event, so if
anyone is going, and you are familiar with the location let me know
which is the best area to meet.  I hope a lot of you go to this event
tonight.

where did this survey come from? it seems that everyone i know is 
suddenly survey-happy because i get about a million and one of them
a day. mostly i delete them because i dont think anyone really wants 
to know all that much about me.. cuz some of them have really weird
personal questions... i dunno. i guess this ones not so bad, but i dont
feel like cutting and pasting my answers. im sure yer all terribly

                  hahah and I freagin work here....

                    Gap is gearing up for Holiday with one of the Company's
                     coolest new stores -- the amazing Shinjuku flagship.

                     To celebrate the opening, Gap is throwing a major
party
                     tonight for customers, featuring The Crystal Method --
                     the music behind Gap's Khakis Rock TV spot. Spinning
                     disks is DJ Koo, from TRF, Japan's first rave group,
                     while Groovisions, a graphic design team, mixes images
                     from Gap ad campaigns on two video walls.

Big Business.  There's a deep black hole I think the ancients called it a

My sweet Heather made a terrific suggestion tonight while at Rhythm.  Why
not everyone *always* wear your pb-cle-raves laminate (made by artist
extrordinaire, Mr. Rab/Mark) and add special stickers to the back for each
party you attend.  It'll be like those people who collect pins at the
Olympics.  For each event they go to, they add another Olympic pin to
their hat.  Well, our hat is the laminate, and our pins could be specialty
stickers. At the end of a year, it'll be a visional reminder of all the
parties we attended.

Rockin?

Braden

*If you want the rest of the story, turn to the end of the book
[flip, flip, flip]

Big Bad Gothic girl awakened from her deep sleep the next morning. A 
wicked smile plastered on her face. In those brief seconds between 
dreams and consciousness, she recalled  flashes of the previous evening.  
Dancers swaying , flashing lights, furtive spankings, confusion, and 
death. Big Bad Gothic Girl then shuddered for a moment.

"No, it can't be real." She didn't seriously believe she could have 
killed anyone let alone convince others to actually end of the life of 
another. 

She thought again that it must have been just some ghoulish Halloween 
trickery. "She didn't really die, I mean I didn't, I couldn't really." 
And the funeral simply mockery in jest.

The Big Bad Gothic Girl pulled herself up from her bed and untangled 
herself from the mesh of torn black fishnet stockings. She gave a brief 
sigh, showered and went to pick out some clothes.  Normally, this would 
have been a quick and easy task, black tee shirt, black jeans or perhaps 
another skirt and some more of her worn but familiar stockings. 

"No!" She said as her eyes fixed upon her special long black dress. It 
was special because this was dress she wore when her father died.  She 
loved her father, but he left early in her life. In death though, she 
strangely missed the few good times they had shared.

Usually, she would have been happy in her own gothic way at such a 
morbid sight.  Now things seemed a bit different, a bit odd, a bit 
melancholy, more than usual.  

She looked away, put on her favorite gothic band shirt, some deep black 
jeans and left her house. Still in a bit of a daze she wasn't sure where 
she was going to.  It was daylight now and the sun was blinding her 
eyes.  It gave her a headache but she had some reason to leave.

She left.  She walked down the street as the afternoon sun heated up her 
dark attire and made her shaky body warm.

She passed the newstand that she liked to check daily, just in case 
there was some evidence of some human evil on the bold headlines.  Today 
there was nothing exciting, just the latest on a muddled political 
scandal and a graphic of some new development plan designed to save her 
terminal city.  Nothing like the usual air plane crash or hurricane to 
reaffirm her belief in an uncontrollable chaotic universe. Another soft 
sigh escaped from her lips.

She passed by the crowds. Families, sickening romantic couples, skaters, 
punks, some black clad gothic looking babies as she liked to called 
them, construction workers,  the masses who all seemed normal to her 
now. Sigh.

She walked until her feet were tired, and the sun was bright, too 
bright.  The next thing she felt was light brush to her face that closed 
off the light and brought a much needed brief moment of clear thought.

She put her hands to her eyes and brushed away a piece of paper. It was 
some goofy looking flyer for a band, or no this was too cute to be a 
band flyer, this was for one of those happy-lovey dovey rave affairs 
which she so despised.

Without a second  thought, she threw the flyer to the ground. Suddenly, 
she felt a quick pain in her hand. She moved her seemingly sprained 
wrist and the sharp pain stopped.

The next thing she knew the sun had blinded her face again.  Then she 
could hear just a faint whisper of wind.  This wind was peculiarly 
strange. She made out a faint but bold voice in its drone. 

"ultimate....."

to be continued...............

Hey, that sounds like a great idea, but the stickers would have to be awful
small, like someone like don or myself or rich from downlow would have 50+
stickers by the end of the year.  Maybe a sign in book at the netmeets, then
we can put some of the pictures in the book also (sort of a scrapbook).  Any
how its just a thought, keep those ideas flying. p.L.u.R. {;-) mark

 My sweet Heather made a terrific suggestion tonight while at Rhythm.  Why
 not everyone *always* wear your pb-cle-raves laminate (made by artist
 extrordinaire, Mr. Rab/Mark) and add special stickers to the back for each
 party you attend.  It'll be like those people who collect pins at the
 Olympics.  For each event they go to, they add another Olympic pin to
 their hat.  Well, our hat is the laminate, and our pins could be specialty
 stickers. At the end of a year, it'll be a visional reminder of all the
 parties we attended.

I don't know what all this bitching is about I think it would be neat to go
and see where we came from ya know, kinda like seeking out our roots! COME
ON GUYS!! Japan's first rave group!!!!!!  I've never heard DJ Koo, but
that's probably because he's soo old skool that none of us have ever heard
of him.  I can't wait to see some more of those Gap ads too, that alone
would be more than enough to get me to drive a couple hundred miles to see
this.  It is soo nice of The Gap to do something so friendly for us
"ravers!"

Sometimes things come too fast.  There is just so much input and chaos and
titillation of the senses in life that you can't always stay in touch with
what's really going on beneath the surface.  I know with my job it can be
like that.  I'll be so much into working that I lose touch with the fact
that I'm overdoing it.  It feels like everything is fine -- until the
meltdown. So, I've learned over time to keep an eye out for psychological
signals.

Well, that said, there is a clear signal I get from going to raves.
Everytime I'm about to leave, I get extremely depressed.  Morose.  Deeply
saddened.  I've had such a fantastic time that leaving makes me genuinely
unhappy.  But when I think of my other activities in life, there are few
if any that inspire the same emotional gripping.  If I go to a bar with my
friends, I could care less when we pay the bill and it's time to go.  
When I'm leaving the tennis court, I occasionally wish to play on, but
usually I'm satisfied.  Movies don't even come close.  Quite frankly,
there is just about nothing that I can think of that generates that almost
child like inner-pouting, "Can we stay just 10 more minutes?  PLEEASE?"
than attending raves.

And this is a clear signal that we're doing something right!

Braden

The thing is they really aren't doing something nice for us. I mean granted
I think everyone has the right to embrace the rave scene..even companies if
they want, but they are doing it for the money, because evidently the "rave
thing" is cool...not really the rave in itself, but the big baggy
pants...or as gap calls them wide leg jeans. It's really all about a money
making scheme if you ask me. All these kids are going to flock to the
stores and buy them, and then when the trend is over they are gonna toss
us"the scene" out like trash and crystal method right along w/ us. I
honestly doubt Gap gives a poop about "raves" I mean how can they say they
are all about raving when most likely they haven't been to a rave and not
only that, but wouldn't be caught dead at one....their job would probably
be on the line.

I like working here, Im not bitching....but's it's just weird to me because
all the sudden my "seperate lives" have kinda been combined....and it's
weird because Im one of millions that repesent the rave scene and these
people ( corp. companies ) don't have a clue to what's really going on.

Okay that's it from me...no more bitching
Amy

The "Generation Gap":

It's kind of flattering, to finally be seduced by the media.  But I don't
care if they are the high school quarterback or hottest cheerleader, I'm

ok, first of all, this goes for ALL commercially marketed clothing
retailers.  want anything but that, and SEW YOUR OWN DAMN CLOTHES.  
not saying that a lot of kids don't do that, just pointing out a flaw in
your logic.

> honestly doubt Gap gives a poop about "raves" I mean how can they say > they are all about raving when most likely they haven't been to a rave > and not only that, but wouldn't be caught dead at one....their job 
> would probably be on the line.

I'm an assistant manager at Gap 604 in Plymouth Meeting, PA, near
Philadelphia.  I grew up in Pittsburgh.  I went to my first official
"rave" in June of 1994.  I had been going to a club where rave music, as
we called it back in the day ; ) was played since 1992.  I started
working at the Gap one month AFTER my first rave in July of 1994.  I
have been an active member of the scene since then.  I get weekend
nights and Sundays off when I have a DJ gig.  The majority of the people
I work with ask me for mixtapes, and they have been since 1994.  The Gap
has tapes sent to us every month.  There has been house and techno
tracks on them since I started working for the company.  The Gap has had
baggy jeans and khakis since before I started working there.  Our
marketing hasn't changed, we have always been looking at the same young
hip market. Lately, though, our advertising spending has become vastly
increased.  Along with the infamous Crystal Method ad, there were ads
with Louis Prima (a jazz/swing artist from when our grandparents were
growing up) and a 70's funk track.  Not to mention the easy and original
fit denim campaigns featured a WIDE variety of popular culture stars,
from missy misdemeanor elliot, run dmc, and aerosmith, to lena horne and
Herb Alperrt.  The Gap has alwways had as its market a young, cool,
socially aware customer, ever since the first store opened in 1969.  The
name Gap itself refers to the generation gap!  So, we're not doing
anything differently now than we have ever done.  

> I like working here, 

you work at the gap too?  what store?  for how long have you been with
the company?  just curious.  : ) 

later

it has been raining in boston continuously for the past two days,
sometimes sideways.  you have more time to think for yourself and do what
you truly want to do when it rains.  this afternoon, i got up and went to
satelite and checked out things marked as progressive trance and hard
trance.  i remembered someone mentioning commander tom (tom cox) so i
picked up (i really cant remember, they are labeled with numbers, it was
NOOM 36, but i don't know the title)  it was very nice.  it was the kind
of mean trance trance that i was searching for.  i was going to go through
the acid trance section, but syliva wanted to go buy fat for her lips
before she had to go to work, it is getting cold now.

i took the record to sylvia's house.  she has a radical panasonic
turntable...just kidding.  but, it works for listening.  i was so pissed
when i heard it skipping...i thought it was just dust on the stylus.  but
there was a big arc scratch across the record.  the question is:  could
the record play properly at the record store on tech1.2Ks because of the
quality of the record player or did i damage it in transit?  i don't think
i damaged it.  the record was in a sleeve, then another sleeve, then a
plastic bag...hmmph.  don't worry, this is not gonna render my stride
discontinuous or involuntarily keep me in some place i'd rather not be. 

i changed my major to biology and i am not going to be a doctor anymore.

i just bought some cassette head cleaner.

also, i have been fiddling with the electronic music lab more often.  now
that we know how to do shit.  we just finished gay-ass general MIDI..yes. 
i am going there after i finish electronic mail.  we have a
sequencer/sampler, mixer, analogue and digitalis synthesizers (arp
odyssey, alesis, kurtzweil).  i knew that the alesis qs6 had the potential
to be rad. last night i found where the teacher hid the 303, 808,
trance-bass, rez, "jungle raga"  patches...there are about 200 of them! 
but it's funny. i guess based on roland copyrights, all of the patches for
x0x are spelled for example: 3oh3.  but i couldnt get them to work last
night..i was excited.  the other kids in the class are ok.  it is an
independent class (we schedule our own time in the lab) and i have only
run into one rave-related kid, he liked popular jungle.  i know that one
of them wants to be a "club DJ specializing in house", the others are just
there.  i have met one girl, coded "AMANDA" that is down with raves here,
the others are just gaptivated (hey funkybizz, work your way up the
gap-ladder and change everything.  mention that you know what the kids
want, pretend that you are motivated by $, get to the top, deceive them,
unite ravers, collapse the company.)  i haven't been going to anything, i
just got my cast off from intergalactic circus on wednesday (fuckers! :)). 
i am supposed to go to "Ghetto Mania" in a Conneticut warehouse on 24 OCT. 
it is being collaborated on by this guy i know..none of the promoters are
non-DJs or management majors.  then, i plan to journey to toronto to
viktor's rave on 28 NOV (over the break of thanks). 

if a child, at toddler stage, is disassociated from its mother for ten
days...he will revolt against her and call her a stinky bitch, terminally
hanging out with the nurses.

<<ok, first of all, this goes for ALL commercially marketed clothing
retailers.  want anything but that, and SEW YOUR OWN DAMN CLOTHES.
not saying that a lot of kids don't do that, just pointing out a flaw in
your logic.>>

Im talking about the kids who DO NOT sew clothes. Im talking about the kids
that are ohh I dunno...13 yrs old...don't go to raves, but maybe think Gap
is cool. They will be having their parents run out and get them the new
wide leg pants. Umm, this just really isn't my point tho...I honestly don't
care who is wearing what. Im just saying this is a money thing...isn't that
what commercial marketing is for?

<<I'm an assistant manager at Gap 604 in Plymouth Meeting, PA, near
Philadelphia.  I grew up in Pittsburgh.  I went to my first official
"rave" in June of 1994>>

Well I work for a division of Gap ( Banana Republic Catalog )here in
Columbus OH I too go to raves and have been for about 3 years and the guy
that hired me knew I went to raves, but we aren't exaclty the San Francisco
office. Personal opinion.

<< The Gap has tapes sent to us every month.  There has been house and
technotracks on them since I started working for the company.>>

Well I heard a jungle track being played in the Gap Store here in Columbus,
but does that mean Mickey Drexler ( CEO of gap for anyone who doesn't know
) is in support raves? I doubt it...or does it mean he is trying to attract
a certain "type" to the store. Im not doing the marketing, but Id say he is
trying to get the "whats cool right now" Who ever heard of a department
store carrying items no one wants to buy??

<<ever since the first store opened in 1969.>>

Yeah as a record and jeans store at that..

<<you work at the gap too?  what store?  for how long have you been with
the company?  just curious.  : )>>

The catalog here in Ohio. I have been here like 3 months now I think. It's
a cool place...

Take Care

Well, I went to this party not quite knowing what to expect.  I new
the venue from having played paintball at it before, and I figured
that unless the promoters had spent a shitload of time clearing out
the course of all barriers and cleaning the paint off the floor that
the party would be in the rental area.  That would mean that the
amount of space would be a little smaller than normal.  It turned out
that the party was in the rental area, but it was all good.  There was
plenty of space because of a chill room off to the side where a fair
amount of people hung out during the nite.

I liked the music alot.  I enjoyed DJ spuared.  I know alot of people
dont like the kind of music he spins that much, but I think its fun to
listen to.  I think the best music of the nite was Tim and Ted Zelch
tho.  I liked all those build-ups, and the tracs were generally high
quality.  I left about twenty minutes after that house guy came on.  I
didnt really like that music.  I missed Dust's set.  I havent seen him
spin for a long time.  I'm kinda wondering if I missed out? Oh well. 
I think my favorite trac of the nite was that one trac from dope
dragon, splurt.  That song inspired me.

Shout outs to everyone I saw up there.  In order of appearance: andy
the pooh, jbrick, geekboy, spike, spyboy, and costa(nice to meet you).
 Hmmm... I might be forgetting someone.  If I am, sorry!

Overall very fun time.  Small party, but very fun.

See you all later!
Josh

the person you are actually referring to is tim zelch. ted played after lenny

of you who missed it...

The 10 year olds, I assume  :)

I was there too and actually thought that the vibe at Rhythm was really
good. Of course, the music at Bent was just outstanding, but Bent didn't
allow for the same social interaction that Rhythm did.

Speaking of which, did anyone dig Rowland the Bastard as much as I did?
He's got my vote for the best set of Fall 1998 so far!  Too bad he's
British, I'd like to hear him spin more often.

I'm too tired to type a review right now . . . must sleep.

Venue : Parking Garage. Pretty cool I guess. One of those venues that make
you blow black stuff out of your nose. (Mmmm) I thought it would be kinda
cold, but it wasn't too bad...if you danced. I liked the location...hope to
see another event there.

Vibe/People : Kinda sounds like the Cleveland party last night. I really saw
only a handfull of people I knew, seemed like most people were 10. I was
feeling a little old at times. The majority of the people were really
nice...giving out candy, introducing themselves...ect ect. I was sober, so
it was a little hard to communicate clearly w/ a few kids. (hehe) I have
been doing the club thing lately at Red Zone and meeting more people my age
that are as equally into the music and dancing, but nothing compares to a
rave :-)

Sound: Awesome, except if you went to the lower level you could still hear
the music from above,  the sound up there was LOUD, and I couldn't even hear
myself think!! I like that!!

Music: REALLY REALLY GOOD!! Does anyone know who the guy was playing hard
trance? Sounded like there was some breakbeat and a little acid going on
there. Anyways he was fuckin awesome. All night the music was just really
good, I didn't want to leave because of that, but bed was sounding pretty
damn good at 6am and my legs just couldn't take it anymore.

I pretty much did not have a good time, but that doesnt mean it was really
bad.  I ended up getting there at 10:30, and waited till about 11:30 before
anybody got there!  At 12:00 my friend did some STUPID shit, and I lost him!
I looked for him for 4 hours hoping to find him, with no luck of course!  I
danced for about 45 minutes total, between my searching.  Clarkee was the only
thing that turned my night around...a little, and seeing Jeremy(AvantGod23),
and meeting up with Braden, and his sweet GF Heather, made my night a little
better too.  I ended up leaving at 4:30 to find out when I got home that my
friend was still at the party!  Of course this doesnt make sence, but when you
give a friend a ride to a party, you expect to see him to give him a ride back
home.  He ended up falling asleep in one of the booth chairs, which was
hidden!!!!!!  Anyways, overall the party was semi lame.  My first Cleveland
party was not worth 12 dollars.  NOW.....Bent on the other hand was
AWESOME!!!!  I feel that Bent voids out my shit time at Rhythm so I consider
Bent my first Cleveland rave....is that legal?  =P  Anyways...peace out

Hugh

It was a kick ass party!  We will start with the venue.  It was kinda dirty,
and greasy, and when you sat on the floor, you would expect to pick up lots of
grime, but....it was worth it because the music was awesome!  Rowland the
Bastard was AWESOME!  It would be sweet to hear him again!  Unfortunately he
is from the UK, and only came to Cleveland for a few hours, so...I hope in the
future we all get a chance to see this guy!  Also about this venue, no running
water, and one bathroom...which was a porta potty!!!!!  YUCK!!!  I ended up
finding a doorway in the back somewhere that lead me where the actual bathroom
was at, but it was all dismantled, bricks everywhere, paint buckets, cement
buckets, bla bla bla...anyways, there was a drain, so.....  Anyways.....
Overall the venue was pretty good.  Great acoustics in the place, so the music
sounded great!!!  Eric D spun a great set...well actually...everything that
was not house was awesome, and the house was actually pretty decent....  I am
not really into house as you can tell....

I danced all night long, and when I didnt, I was macin on the women....which
by the way, I never knew how many good kissers there are out there, I also
never had such good back rubs...oooh..orgasmic!  Anyways...

Shouts to Braden, Eric, Amanda, Steve, Amy, Jenn, Kerri, and Mark(thanks for
the stickers) which at this point seems to be the only names I remember from
this list that went....and anyone else that might remember me, that I so
happened to forget!  Like i said before I SUCK at names.  To bad Matt, and
Benny could not join me at my umm...first good Cleveland rave, but next time I
hope!

Over all, the music was awesome, the venue was decent, and the vibe was
beautiful.  One thing that really really really sucks is that I missed 7up,
and Elysium tag!!!!  I left because I was soooo soooooo tired....which I know
now was a mistake!  That was one of the many reasons why I went to Bent.
Also...the netmeet was...well basically there was no netmeet.  I met one
person from the list, and I forgot his name, but that was it!  Atleast is was
a new face.  Well thats it I hope on my review.  Peace to everybody, and be
seein ya all soon.

review of rhythm...

i had a pretty good time. i was really surprised to see that many people
there. i don't remember the last time i saw u4ia so packed. i was also
*really* surprised to see so many people dancing. still too many people
being tripped over on the perimeters, but at least the people who were
actually on teh dancefloor were dancing. 

we missed kevin and alex, who i heard, spun really well that evening. i'm
sorry i missed it, as i was planning to brock out out until the next
jungle installment quite some time away. 

we arrived right as tigger was beginning his set. he had everyone out on
the floor, and i was very proud of him, except for when he played my most
hated house song ("cuz i'm beautiful-you're beautiful"--it's right up
there in terms of hate with the workout song and the horny song--i have a
very low threshold for cheesehouse). 

after tigger, mastervibe and clarkee tagged an oldschool breaks set. i was
actually pleased that they were playing this, because i was expecting it
to hear clarkee spin "european techno" (read: gabber), and i was happy his
set never got there. in a state of relief, we had a really really good
time dancing to their set. the best part of their set was cleveland
raver artifact veronica's quote for the night "i feel like i'm 21
again!!!" and getting to see her do her old raver dance! (gotta love ya
roni). also, clarkee and mastervibe looked pretty pleased with the crowd
reaction, and that made me happy. 

after the tagteam, i went and walked around, err..tripped over people, i
mean. hung out for a bit. we stayed for about ten minutes of urban's set,
and then took off. anyone want to comment on mastervibe's jungle?

overall, i had a suprisingly good time for not hearing any drum n bass,
my body's killing me, though. oh well...

big up the left front speaker massif,


kate

	Well... I can't explain how amazing carl cox is. Despite the 1200 miles that
I and ratfink just put on my car, and the time it took driving to DC, It was a
very worthwhile time... The triple deck wizard kept the floor jumping for....
yes... three hours... I have to believe that he was a most amazing dj not only
to hear, but also to watch. The venue was very asthetically pleasing.. the
typical warehouse w/ two rooms, but with an outdoor chillroom. Imagine walking
out to the chillroom and seeing the capital building. Anyways this is starting
to sound like rambling so...

I had a loooong weekend.

Moonshine Overamerica 98:

Left for D.C. kinda late Friday,
therefore missing Cirrus.
Carl Cox kicked my ass for a few hours
(actually about 3).
That was the main room.  It was pretty big.
It had a multi-color laser that was a real
feast for the eyes.
Good sound, too.
The second room (near entrance)
had cool props, and amazing sound.
Only two cabinets, and the lower had four 18"ers.
One fired down, one up, one left and one right.
(Not the usual 2 facing out.)
This is the most powerful bass (and quality)
per square foot I've ever heard!
(Don from Wiz Wrkshp- What are these? They rule!)

The outside chill room (???) 
uuh, it was a neatly tucked little corner outside
the club, secured.  Nice weather out there.
Really pleasant party, the best music around by
far.  Now I'm spoiled!
Whelp, it was worth it.
Cool flyers, too.

Bent:
(Go Fame!!!)

Add no sleep after D.C. with some shadiness and that is
my Saturday nite.  You get my experience.  I was not having a good 
time at the start (a slight chemical imbalance), but
after I was taken care of for a while, I got down and
danced.

Good sound, I think, and GREAT DJs.
Especially 7 Up's tag with Elysium,
then Smallz, who ripped out my still beating
heart and showed it to me before I died.
Ladies and gentleman, this guy can SPIN!!!
My ass was thoroughly in pain after his set!

Again, thanks to all who aided in my bomb ass
weekend:  Jenn, Case, Rich, etc...
Sorry about any negative vibes that may
have slipped out!


P.S.-  I missed the net meet (???),
but I'll see everyone at the next one.

	
				-Bye!!!!!

     -Dave

Hello, all. I was wondering if anyone knew which dj spun "Foxy Lady" 
track "Intergalactic," if it was the same dj. Bent was my second party; 
the first in Clev. and I enjoyed it very much. Thanx to everyone who 
made me feel comfortable in a new environment. 


Peace,
Donnell

There is a new update to the progression of "Barely Legal" I know this
might disappoint a few people, but Freekboy will not be performing...but
he will be replaced by Tic Tak of the Bassheads in Cleveland.  Tic Tak
will be playing a special set of jazz-step jungle beginning at 9:00pm.
Hope noone is too dissappointed...by the way Freekboy is me;) 
peace.

person who i used to go with moved back home to Cleveland. PLEASE HELP
ME!!! I am begining to go through withdrawl. If you are anywhere near
Toledo and can help me please call!!!   (419)578-2436  I always bring
lots of candy , toys, hugs and lots of smiles.

So I'm web surfing right.  Looking for stuff for Magick, costumes for
baldie and I, glow toys and goodies.  I type in the word "glow toys" and
do a search.  I find all of these sites that sell carnival supplies,
bingo stuff, & other cheap toys.  This one in particular:
www.spinlolly.com has a section within the glow-toy section just for
ravers.  Along with over-priced glow stuff they sell accessories such as
the surgical mask/vapo rub combo, and the glow necklace with attached
pacifier with the caption "Why chew your mouth off.  Bite This."
Yea, bite this.
There's another section (mind you, the same site) where you can buy
tapes from the DJs sets at the Moontribe desert parties out west.  What
the heck?  How does all of this come from simply typing "glow toys" into
the search engine box?  I was half expecting to see Scott Henry's head
pop up on the screen and start boppin' around. All from "glow toys".

I thought Rhythm was great.  The only part I didn't like was at the end, the
bouncers just started yelling at everybody to get out.  I went to Bent also
but was extremely intoxicated to even remember what happened!

This was a fun party, even if it did lack some intensity due to other
events going on that night.

The venue was the lobby of a paintball arena next to Metropol.  A very
clean virgin space and reminded me of the dance floor of Club Laga for
some strange reason.

The DJ booth was on a balcony above the dancefloor so I didn't get
to witness much skill action as I prefer to spend less time trainspotting
and more time on the floor. 

Kira started out the night with some really nice funky jungle.  Lots of
big brassy horns that just felt um really funky and could help but smile.

Dj^2 did more of a techstep(?) jungle mix which proved a nice hard
contrast to Kira's set.  I was suprized on the night of Rythym there would
be so much Jungle, but I was far from disapointed.

Dust and one of the Zelches played too very dancy sets with lots of trance
and had the floor grooving for a good part of the night.  I didn't
recognize many of the tracks but the mixing was very smooth.

Lenny Fontana played a nice house set including, yes that Gym Tonix song
that probably a few of you are sick of but for me it was a nice,
2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and back, pickup at um 3:30 am or so.

The final Zelch brother ended the evening with a house set that I can only
describe as, flowery.   It made me want to go out and talk to the
sparrows and tadpoles. I never heard anything like that before but
andy-the-pooh and I agreed it was "Most excellent."

Props to Tim/Ted[Twin Productions], Wizard Workshop, Electrolyte, Type_o
(who didn't have their screens set up but still showed, very impressive),
Sunshine Kids, and DNS.
We were by the pop machines all night anyways so I don't think there was an
ofical net meet since most of us knew each other anyay, but prolly
should remember to wear my laminate just in case so I thank thee net-ravah
massif as well:
Andy-da-Pooh, Icarus, DShwanke, Josh, Vibes 420, spike, xspyboy. And
anyone else I may have missed there.

See ya @ MAGICK!

plur,
jbrick

I am hopeing to find my way back to Erie over fall break to make it
Impact. I just started going to school here so its essential to check
out the party scene. Only problem is finding a place to  crash from Sat
afternoon to Sun at 12pm cuz my dorm will be locked & noone is allowed
back in until Sun. Who else on the list will be going? I think the only
other pb-cle party is Barely Legal in Cle. I am hoping for Impact will
be a good one, I'm too impatient to wait for Magick = p

will there be enough in attendance for a netmeet? I missed the one at
exposure.

I'm sorry, but that's the mainstream. a fairly preppy friend of mine
once told me about how her sister always bought vintage clothes & cool
thrift store stuff and that she always thought her sister looked cool
but she herself didn't want to bother putting in so much time finding
"the perfect shoes" or whatever. hence she usually shopped at the mall.
this was a big surprise to me & made me somewhat sad, but it helped me
realize that most people just don't care about a lot of things... hence
they are the mainstream... many people just turn on the radio to hear
some music, not bothering to find rare grooves or anything... do you
know how recycling succeeded in seattle? the city made it cheaper to use
recycling (saves on garbage bill) and put recycling bins all over. why?
because you have to make it easy for people to do something if you want
the majority to do it.
this probably sounds cynical, but I've pretty much passed the point of
blaming the mainstream for being so commercial and well, average... at
the same time, everyone has something special to offer to society.
so why should we care if rave-wear is offered up as the next big thing?
yeah, maybe people outside the scene are buying big pants, but are they
going to enjoy 6 hours of hard techno? that's doubtful. another thing to
consider is that this is  a fashion trend that is already declining on
the west coast... it's likely to reach a peak here and then subside
again. 
anyway, we should be more worried about shiesty promoters than kids who
are buying big pants but listening to no doubt (hey big pants are real
comfortable.)

I agree with you on that. Most of the people who are dressing like ravers
don't exactly know who's style they are copying. So they'll just wear thier
big pants to cheesy clubs and we will stay in our warehouses. But the more
well- known raves become, more people are going to look at it as a money
making venture, meaning more shiesty promoters. But when something goes
mainstream, it has a tendency to stagnate, and that's what I'm worried
about. I don't care about fashion. I care about the music. And it will be
in grave danger of stagnation if techno ever gets really mainstream (it's
already almost there). At the same time, I kinda feel bad about keeping
something that makes me really happy a big secret, even from the
mainstream.

I wouldn't fear too much about techno becoming more mainstream.  There
will be live acts like the Crystal Method who draw large and varied
crowds, but just because a DJ or an act gets mainstream acclaim I doubt
they will stop doing long live sets.  Of course they will end up charging more on an average,
but this is capitalism.

Have to address the shiesty promoter thang:

This is something we ALL have control over.  Since we're a group that thrives
on interrelation and knowing our promoters, DJs, and fellow party-goers ,we
empower ourselves to pick and choose who to support and who not to.  There's no
doubt that in the near future imposters (if you will) will try to capitalize on
what WE are doing.  Fortunately they believe that with a nifty flyer design and
and a checkbook they can create something that will appeal to the masses.  It
might, but it won't appeal to the ravers.  I'm convinced.  They won't be in the
loop of what really goes on at parties.  They've already been here (NGL) and
are present right now if you think about it (won't mention any names). But it's
you and I who can manage their success or failure.  So rave clothes are going
mainstream.  Sounds like it's time for ravers to come up with something new.
And there's always something new.  Besides, it's absolutely not the clothing
that difines what we're doing.  Not by a long-shot.

Keep it real!!

i think techno is a ways off from being mainstream.  most ppl cant listen
to it coz "it all sounds the same"   maybe some housey stuff or some
breaks, but the rest most kids cant listen to.  guess what i dont play when
kids stop over that dont go to parties?   my old cds and stuff like that.
the 12's stay off.
oh well....

no, i want what i want, i want instant gratification, and i want it now.
i'm an atomic baby,  born and bred on microwave ovens  and teevee that's 
always there to keep me warm and happy.....
                    I said "no" to drugs, but they just wouldn't listen.

I've been looking for halloween ideas so I copied your search except got
much different results.
I used hotbot and the first thing on there was a novelty sex store that
specializes in Bachelor parties.  Glow in the condoms popped up and then
some toy stores.  I guess we know what's on the minds of the programmers
at hotbot!

This site was kind of cool though...lots of cheesy glow thingys for sell.

No dickin' here.
House of Styles had an event in the works with Frankie Bones, Heather
Heart, O'Sheen, and locals.  Fame Records was also organizing a charity
event on the same date, Nov 13.  John (HOS) didn't want to promote
against a charity event and has graciously moved his line-up in with the
Fame event (Terry Mullan).
I'm talking with John as I type this.  He feels bad that anyone would
think that this was an insult against Pittsburgh.  His last Ohio event
was a choice.  This time, he says it just seems like the right thing to
do.

I REALLY want to believe you, I really do. I hope you are right. But that's
exactly what I used to think about punk, and look what happened. See,
people like what they hear on the radio. It's not a matter of personal
taste, if you hear it enough, your mind begins to accept it. Oasis, a
complete ripoff of the beatles, got popular because they sounded a lot like
the beatles. It's not that people really liked them, it's because they
accepted them instantly, because they'd already heard and liked the
beatles. If you hear something often enough, you generally end up liking
it.
I used to not like techno, until I lived in a house full of ravers. I heard
it so much that I started to like it more and more...

Love,
Amber

I totally agree with you. There are some promoters (won't mention any
names, either) that I always boycott. But this scene is growing really
fast, and a lot of kids are too new to it to know anything about promoters.
They just look at the lineup. It's sad to say, but a really awesome lineup
often takes money, which is one thing that a lot of shady promoters have.
I'm not saying that money automatically equals shade, but this is often the
case, in my experience. What I see happening is this: The real party kids
retreat further and further underground, while the masses go to events put
on by imposters.
The imposters will only care about making money, so bad things will happen
at their events, giving raves an even worse reputation than they already
have. Maybe I'm just being a pessimist, but I do think about this a lot,
and it worries me...

Love,
Amber

Hi guys, as much as i try to be positive about things i still have to call it
as i see it. So far  as BENT is concerned thing got off to a bad start when
there were no turn tables to start off the rave.  They came about an hour
later.  The other thing that happened is because i must look like some sort of
authority figure, i had about 15 kids ask me where wuz the bathroom.  That was
a good question, but there were a lot of other people that knew where it was
at ( in a dark corner, the back door, beside a car or any where they felt)
finally when the one port a john showed up a long line formed and got longer
by the end of the night.  I think if you got in line during the jungle set you
might have made it to the john by 7-ups set.  So if any of you kids sat in
something wet i hope it was just spilled water.  over all i thought the music
was good especially Foxy Lady, and rock around the clock, but around 3am the
music got very dark which was fitting for the venue, i mean i would have lost
my left foot inside if it wasn't attached.  Unfortunately I had to leave at
4:20 am to get back to the burgh. I am real sorry i missed 7-ups set I am sure
that would have been the highlight of my night. And What happened to the NET
meet, but then again it was so dark i really didn't see many people i knew. I
am also sorry this review was so negative, but maybe by pointing out these
problems we can have a better rave next time. Talk to yunz kids later.

Man, FUCK THAT.  I'm sorry but I think that is wrong.  John has been
postponing dawn forever, and finally he gets it together and moves it
to Cleveland.  It's not like it would be the first time there was a
party in cleveland and pgh either.

Frankie bones . . . heather heart . . . osheen.  Who needs them more,
pgh or cle?  pgh as far as i'm concerned.  why doesn't he get fame to
move their party to pgh?

 . . . one dissapointed/angry guy . . .

real dance music will never be popular enough to play on mainstream 
radio or whatnot. think about reprazent's song "brown paper bag". the 
only way it got the tiniest bit of hype, was when it was whittled down 
to less than 5 minutes (the original is about 9 minutes) and had a rap 
layed over it. there may be pale imitations, but the real thing will 
always be more underground.

Kelly is right...It is so simple.
You show your support to promoters who throw good parties and stay home when the shady ones who are throwing their latest mega-rave.  Buying your ticket is your vote on how the scene will be.  How many times has anyone said I'll never go to a (fill in promoter
here) party again.  But it seems that all they need to do is have a superstar headliner on their flier. (Never mind that said superstar may or may not be there, and may or may not know anything about mixing records)
I guess that is why Local 13, etc are still around, even though they continue to fuck everything up for everyone. Take control, it's your scene.

Ummm, it wasn't too long ago that ravers didn't necessarily wear big pants
either.  (It was all about wearing something that would either a) make
someone smile or b) fuck with someone's head.)  Damn, if you dropped a
dozen ravers dressed like 5 years ago into the middle of a NYC party today,
they wouldn't make it out alive!

I mean, I figure we copied the style too--we didn't invent it either--so we
can't get mad about mainstream mall USA copying us.

So, let's do something about it.  If every teenybopper on the block is
wearing fat pants, and we're worried about the raver's image getting
diluted, then we should wear something else, something more imaginative. 
Next time you see someone at a party in something original (something that
you can't buy at the mall), compliment them on it!  Our identity's in the
music, not in the width of our pants!

Well, I wasn't going to mention any names, but since you did, I might as
well say that Local 13 is EXCATLY who I was talking about when I said that
I boycotted certain promoters. I know some Philly kids, and I haven't met a
single one yet that goes to Local 13 parties. They make their money off of
newer kids that don't live in the area and don't know how shady they are.
And that's what I'm worried about. It's fine for us, 'cuz we know who (and
who not) to support, but a lot of kids don't. 
Ok, now I will stop posting about this and polluting the list with my
opinions.

Love,
Amber

Hi Kids, are you ready to get scared? In a previous E-mail (listed below) I
talked about a tour of REAL haunted houses. Well it is that time of year
again. A guided walking tour of the Allegheny West neighborhood will be held
on Oct 24th , If anyone is interested going let me know.  We can meet
somewhere then go on the tour.
The tour is called "Spirits of Old Allegheny" so far this is who is going:    
MrRab@AOL.com aka mark

NEXT?
(PREVIOUS E-MAIL)
In reference to your discussion about life after death, I happen to know for a
fact that there is an existence after death.  I heard all the ghost stories,
and stories about angels and sighting of the virgin Mary, but I was 85%certain
that there is life after death.  The 15% uncertainty bothered me, until I went
on a tour of haunted houses on the North side of Pittsburgh, the people at the
house said that most of the "ghost" activity revolved around the main stair
well.  So while the rest of the people looked around the house and antiques I
focused on the stair well.  Before I knew it something humanoid in shape but
fuzzy gray in translucent color whisked by at the top of the steps about 15ft
in front of me.  I didn't say anything at first, but I told my girlfriend a
little later.  She told me she saw the same thing but she was a bit closer and
saw it from a different angle.  To her it looked like a little person or
child.  After the tour we went back and told the owner of the house what we
saw and where it was going.  He informed us that he has never seen that ghost,
but many guest to his house described the same sighting.  The only difference
was the other people saw it coming out of a door and going up stairs, we saw
it going down stair into the door.  Now I am 100% certain that their is
something after death.  Just because you can't touch it or weigh it or put it
through scientific study doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Try to touch an ego,
or happiness, or sorrow, you can't prove they exist either. Any way I was
straight as a board when I saw this so was my girlfriend.  {:-o Mark

WOOORD UP JIZZESUS!  That's what ravin' and techno and shite is all bout'
anyway...stealin, stealin, stealin!  Takin' a bit from here, a bit from
there, and making something new, goofy, and fun out of it.

I think the only way big pants became a "raver thing" was other new ravers
copying the kids who did like em' ultrabig, because its not like all
ravers everywhere forever have worn big pants. its not a thing at all in
europe so i hear.

And on that 'techno' bustin through...its not going to happen for a really
long time.   Hell, even most 'ravers' don't like alot of techno, and can't
tell it apart, so how can it even conceivably be radio friendly.

Of course, i think the whole idea of mainstream vs. underground has been
pretty worthless for a while.  With the existance of the net,
'underground' music has a much better footing.  Only 3 years ago, the only
way I could hear jungle and hardcore was to buy a mixtape or go to one of
the few raves that had it here.  Now i can pop on the net at my leisure,
and check out literally dozens of live or recorded sets, chat with
producers, order vinyl or mixes online, and all this while avoiding some
corporate middleman or annoying advertizements.

And i think this stuff only helps the real-life person-to-person/tribal
gathering scene because people know what they like better, and the
person-to-person energy is really the best part of tings...

Now if only everyone had access/fast enough connections....

soon enough.

I have an idea.  Let's set up a "PHAT PANTS" table at the next party and
lure all of the new kids into buying all the used old PHAT PANTS.  And all
the ravers can play a nasty trick on them and all wear spandex that night.
Then we'll all know who's who.
"PHAT PANTS FOR SALE!"  Recycle your PHAT PANTS.

IMPACT is at Club Insomnia at Fusion Records.  A.K.A.- IQ Records.  Smaller
venue than IQ was, but great sound and atmosphere.

Visit Fusion Records at http://fusionrecords.8m.com
BTW, the tickets are $10.00 not $15.00 as I said before.

Actually, there's one particular raver than I (and I would bet many of
you) know quite well that ONLY wears spandex to parties.  You can identify
her by her all-spandex garb as well as her wonderful light toys and her
forever flashing camera!  She was at my first party and many since and
she's definitely a fixture in the Pittsburgh raving community!  Guess who
she is!

my first thought when i seen the word spandex was richard simmons and the 80s.
Definetly not ravers. But of course,  some ravers manage to  make anything
look better.  I dont think I've seen this spandex-wearing girl yet.
Individuality is the hallmark of raving. :o)

ok well i was thinking to my self...another fuck up in our scene is gonna be
coming along becuase of gap/mtv
as you have noticed they are getting into techno a lot i mean look all over
mtv theyre using our styles and animation...soon kids will ask parents to get
them phat clothes and ask for money to goto raves and do k or some shit..i
think its really gonna give us a dillema and hopefully a few new real ravers
but lots of lets say "posers" and a lot of gang activity at raves...
justr a lil more of my brain

I've been raving for three years.  I LOVE phat pants.  In the first six
months I wore VERY slim pants to parties.  I wore plastic pants, satin
pants, little jeans, etc.  I started to notice how interestng larger
legged pants looked when people danced.  I don't really know if I really
like the dancing pants or just the dancing.  Anyway, my first pair of
"phat" pants weren't really that fat.  After awhile, I became an inch
whore!  I guess I've sort of backed off a little but I still don't feel
quite comfortable dancing unless I'm wearing phat pants.  There's just
something about them.  I love how they flow.  I love how gaunt little boys
and girls look in them.  They also look really neat in belly-dance!

As far as trends go, it DOES annoy me when people jump on the band wagon
and jump off just as easily.  It IS possible, though, to discover a new
kind of music, fashion, sub-culture in a fit of popularity and to be so
enamored with it that one wants to enjoy it far past it's moment in the
sun.  It also makes me a bit suspicious when I see someone change their
'look' drastically and all of a sudden.  Just random thoughts, no
particular organization.

Maybe the pb-cle list could sponsor some kind of a clothes donation thing
at the next event? For the homeless or for ravers (not that im putting the
two in the same catagory or anything). I have some stuff Id either like to
give away or sell. I kinda quit wearing big pants too a few months ago...I
mean granted I don't wear cootchie cutters, but Im not wearing the 42"
anymore.

Just a thought....

Excerpts from mail: 12-Oct-98 Re: {pb-cle} funny thing by Frankie G@yahoo.com
>what's the story behind that?

I was just poking fun at Tom.  I had no ill intensions, I think Tom knew
that.  Most people think Starchild is wack anyways, I couldn't resist
throwing him into the mix.  I really should stop dissing
Starchild...it's just too easy.  ;)

BTW the scratch picklez do tend to get to get too much props and
publicity.   Shortkut isn't all that, but Q-bert is pretty fuck'n good! 
He's had allot of influence on djs around the country.
No-one anywhere around here can skratch like him.

I really liked "overheard at the rave" good moral behind it!! The moral I
always tell you about. You gottah live life the way you want to, because
before you know it life will live you and pass you by.

I doubt that, most people that hear the stuff on TV and think that is "the
shit," won't venture out of what is being played on MTV or in commercials.
They'll buy Chem Bros and Prodigy forever now because they are techno bands.
If they were going to be flocking into the rave scene because of commercials
they would have done it by now I think.  The bigger parties they will go to
because they are more like concerts than the smaller parties, or parties
that don't have huge flyers and stuff, and it all goes back to keeping it
real err sumthin like that.  Also, most kids don't know that "phat" pants
are something from the raving community, they just think they are hip so
they buy them.

Reminds me of my first year of college where at all the frat parties they played
the same old tired NIN song "Bow down before the one you serve....."  And they
thought they were so crazy and "alternative".  It was a few CDs, a few anthems.
Just like now.  Then it was NIN and the Cure.  And I'm sure there were Trent
Reznor & Robert Smith fans that were pissed about Mr. Polo listening to their
music.  Now it's Roni Size and the Chem Bros.  Let's remember too that for most
raving is a lifestyle and truly MOST PEOPLE CAN'T HANDLE IT!! (or afford it, or
lose sleep over it, or understand it, or SEE it).  They can however, handle the
random house track on their CD player at the beach.  Let them have fun.  If they
can figure out how to access all of this crazy stuff, more power to them.

Back to the music for a second, here:

I bought this fantastic mixtape at Bent with DJ Hype on one side and some
guy named Randall on the other.  I just can't believe how good this
Randall dj is.  Does anyone know about him?  Does he produce his own stuff
or is this someone else's records?  Finally, what kind of jungle is this?  
Hardstep?  Dark hardstep?  Afro hardstep?  Whatever it is, it's made a d&b
lover out of me -- I couldn't stand jungle until this past summer. Then I
heard something at Crystallized 2 that completely blew me away.  Now I
think this is every bit as good as trance or techno.

Braden

i would call Randall & Hype, Hardstep but i don't like the labels, i
just call them GOOD u.k. jungle. i saw Hype last month in Toronto, and
he was amazing, a good mix of new tracks (his own dubplates) & old
school tracks... Randall also puts out his own records, with
Metalheads, but i am not sure on which label his new stuff is on. he
will be in Toronto for Freakin on Oct.31 if you like to drive, or
support our scene and go to Magick (hello Kelly) which looks real
good.      if ya like jungle go see Dj Spooky tomarrow @ Peabodys
Cleveland, I will be there...

whoa, i do hope that was just a joke!  it seems like it was, so i'm not too=

geez, if you haven't heard them doing stuff you should check out the=
 cutchemist vs shortkut "live at the futureprimitive" disc or the qbert vs=
 dstyles disc.  they just do the craziest shit with hip hop stuff, stuff=
 that i've never heard a single house/trance/jungle/whatever dj even come=
 close to trying or actually accomplishing it at a party.  well, wait, i=
 take that back, i've seen it once...dj swamp at a party at the=
 rollerskating place in cleveland maybe a year ago, it was a spawntaneous=
 event (and hey, spawntaneous has swamp coming back to town again this=
 halloween!).  but then again swamp is pretty much a hip hop cuttin n=
 scratchin dj, not really a housey/jungle dj.  they bounce back and forth=
 between two to three 12"s in order to catch one drum here, two drums there,=
 another drum over there, in order to reconstruct and construct new songs=
 right then and there.  it's insanity.

whatsup all?  i had a pretty good time for my first cleveland party.  i 
was a little uncomfortable at first, not gettin there till about 1 and 
parkin 2 or 3 blocks away.  shouts to Bens bar!  it was karaoke nite 
there an we were gonna stop in for a few before the party but decided 
against it *GRIN*.
The sound system was nice.  i kinda felt right up front, even half way 
to the back door.  the shape of the building have somethin ta do with 
that i guess.  
The light show was definitely fun.  i guess i noticed it more because of 
the pitch black darkness elsewherez.
The portapoty: yikes.  this was one of the scarier attractions that 
nite.  i used it once and once only as soon as i got there. with no 
re-entry, there was no sayin hi to a bush outside, ya know!  no lites, 
(didn't try a match %^} ).
MrDJ's:  smooth.  i wasn't as impressed with Rowland's set as everyone 
else, but Halo was magically delicious.  i ?think? that's the first time 
i've heard him.  Cunninghams set got me back up when i was out of 
juice--and my water gone :(   i missed zac's set (but i guess he spun at 
afterhours), and i had to split just after 7up/elysium was up.
Netmeet:  my pocketwatch apparently ran out sometime that day, so i made 
it up to the tables at 2:15, and didn't notice anybody in particular 
(course in the dark, w/o glasses didn't help).  i pologize to anyone i 
missed there.  i pretty much danced up close to the tables, off to the 
right all nite.
Gotta get on the books these next couple weeks, so it looks like Cosmic 
Cow and maybe the Avenue are my only outlets  %^(
Nov 7th is probly my first outing, any ideas?  ?Get Freaky 3?  2 was 
kinda fukt up, but Sugar Hill made my nite.  anything else?

who was it you heard at crystallized? the only drum n bass dj who spun 
at that party that i know of was andy/dj sine...

randall has been around since day one, he was spinning house back in 
like '89, one of the godfathers along with fabio, grooverider, etc. 

i dont know what tape you have of his, so i cant say, but randall has 
always tended to stick to the harder side of things, as opposed to 
bukem-esque atmospheric jungle. he's one of my favorite djs...shame on 
you braden, you could have seen him play live at phryl's party 
'forward'...part of the ram records tour. he was pretty damn good ;)

peace,

sup everyone?

i thought it would be a cool idea to come up with some sorta survey
for everyone on pb-cle to fill out so we could get some sorta idea
what "joe average {pb-cle}" is like... so if anyone has got any
questions they would like to be answered, send em to me privately, or
discuss 'em on the list, i guess. i'm gonna try to make it as
entertaining and ridiculously long as possible + put it up on the web,
so it'll be easy to fill out and submit.

As far as raves going mainstream, I had a friend ask me if a lot of people
"slam-danced" at raves...I'm pretty sure her only exposure to techno was
Prodigy's "Smack My Bitch Up".  I told her the most violent thing I'd ever
seen at a party was people giving huge loving hugs.  I think the biggest
impact of a few electronic-based musical acts making Billboard's top 10 is
creating an awareness, albeit a misinformed awareness, that the rave scene
exists.
 Wouldn't it be great if every place you went you were treated with the
same acceptance and love that is found at raves?  One thing I've learned is
that parties shouldn't be an end. It's easy to get caught up in the scene
and look to it as the only place to feel that love and support, but it's
important to take that love and spread it out to the rest of the world, to
spread it wherever you go, seven days a week and not just at parties.  For
me, parties are like getting my batteries recharged.  Raves definitely
aren't for everyone, but everyone could definitely benefit from PLUR, not
just kids in phat pants (or spandex).  I'm not trying to sound preachy
because I know many people feel the way I do.  I'm just glad that there are
such things as raves, because they have really shown me that there is hope
for the world and that I'm not the only one who feels this way.  While I
hope that the rave culture stays underground, I hope that its positive
effects will spread out to all humanity, and that is up to us.
I just wanted to thank you all for making such a positive difference in my
life.  I love you guys.
                      Dan

Not a bad idear.  The whole rave for charity thing is an underexplored
concept.  There's lots of djs who'd play for free and lots of causes that
i'm sure raver kids would support.  Ah, nah, why would we want to start
having a conscience?

How about this: everybody go to their local thrift-store and buy something
spiffy, goofy, tackey, whatever, don't spend more than like $5. Then at
the next netmeet we'll all swap and we'll have to wear whatever we got
from the other person.  Of course we'd have to hook it up so people of the
same size traded...ah well...technicalities.

i'll tell you guys all one thing.......
    when you see me at a party, hell, i'll have "phat pants" on
definatly....i feel at home in them so much.....and i have to agree with
who said they like how those little girls and boys look in them..hell
yea
adorable!

i've always worn them always will, and fuck those other people who wear
them to be "cool". i always get smart remarks about my pants.  so i
guess i piss people off hahhaha.
 
and hell, we were all new at some point, i still feel as though i am..
  aren't we supposed to welcome the new kidz????  i would be so turned
off if i went to a party and they were being all shady to the new kidz,
espesially if i were a new one.  i thought everyone was afraid of the
scene dying, and now getting to much publicity...

   i'm just here reading....
          i'm not being weird or anything, but that's just how i feel.
only the real ravers know what it's about and that's something that
can't go mainstream (**the v-I-b-E**), and it's the only thing that IF
IT WENT MAINSTREAM THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE

    is that the missing peace in today.....or what!!!!!!


this has been bagiNa throwing in her $.99 cents, and hope know one back
lashes her....and i hope i didn't piss anyone off

    Me and my friends arrived at bent a little after 1
a.m. It was kind of nice to be back at the old boat
storage(Though it looks  like they no longer have boats
there). i think this would mark my 5th time there. This
is a fairly large venue. in fact i was separated from
my friends for over 3 hours. There were a couple of
friends i didn't even know were there till morning when
we could see better. I don't know what it is about dark
venues but i like them. I think maybe i lose the
paranoid feeling of big brother watching me. It also
makes the lighting that much better.The two major
drawbacks were the grease and grime all over the place
and the lack of port-a-johns. However there were
letting people re-admit as early as 1 a.m.too bad i
didn't know this till about 3:30 (after i had waited in
line for the port-o-pot for 20 mins). I cant believe it
hadn't overflowed. The other bad thing about this spot
is there is no place to sit. U can't sit on the cars or
boats anymore and who wants to sit on the floor and get
that grimy shit all over their clothes. Lastly I
thought the venue would be colder than it was. I made
the mistake of wearing long sleeves. :(

    As far as the music was concerned. in my opinion it
was good. lots of different styles and all sounding
good. U could defiantly tell when rowland took over the
decks & our bodies. Other stand outs where  the awesome
7-up/elysium tag team, nito's disco set was nice, and
smalls closed the show with lots of energy. The other
d.j.'s were good as well. I always enjoy hearing kevin
cunningham, even if its two nights in a row. The only
no show i believe was osheen, who ive seen several
times anyway.

    The net meet (my first one) was rather small for a
party of this size. I only met two people Braden &
Hugh. both were really cool. Im not sure of the next
party im going to,  looks like it might be barley
legal. Maybe i will get to meet more of you there. till
then. p.l.u.r.

it's a false alternative.  it's a quick fix to supress the insatiable
mindless mass of organisms that lie between the second and ninety-eighth
percentiles on the bell curve of creativity deficiency.

hey downlow:

i am suing you.  my name is andy toth and i obtained a stress fracture in
my left tibia on 19 JUl 98 at one of your "rave" events.  i just got it
fixed, i don't want to break it again at magik.  it won't break and i
won't sue you if you put me on the guestlist.  (plus, i'm coming from
boston)....come on, je suis pauvre.

sike gnawl.  just kidding.  i broke it myself.  i won't break it this
time.  but, seriously, it has been such a pain just for eight hours of
fun.  casts, i start physical therapy this week.  wow..i am so dedicated. 
it was probably meant to happen because 401 people have asked me why/how i
broke my leg and i would say: "jumping up and down at a rave in pittsburgh
on july 19th on an ice rink"  insane publicity for the pittsbugh rave
scene.  it has probably reinforced the conception of what a rave is to a
non-raver only influenced by the media.  CASE 1 reponse: "you have an
injury as a result of fun, i could never be as real as you"  CASE 2
response: "i respect you for obtaining an injury from fun".  the former
being the predestined "nonraver" the latter "the raver".  raving is based
on sadism.

hmm, that track is not one of my favorites just because it focuses so littl=
 on the drumming, or at least the drumming is not quite as engaging as on=
 most of his dj shadow stuff.  and i especially just don't care about the=
 track before that one with the girl singing over light atmospherics for=
 like 4 minutes.  it just doesn't do anything for me the way the main title=
 theme, bloodstain, unreal, and lonely soul do.  the stuff with kool g rap=
 is pretty good too, but it seems like there's just so much emphasis on the=
 lyrics that there's not much intricately developed with the drums.

i do have it, and i've gotta say that i love it.  it's got really thick=
 bassy beats and a lot of atmospherics, strings, arrangements in the=
 background.  he does some quality scrathcing on it too.  and his flow is=
 mostly pretty laid back and slow, although some if it gets dense at times. =
 overall though, it's just great to chill out too...stuff just rolls off his=
 tongue and most of his stuff is fairly, shall we say descriptive?  he is=
 really into sort of painting lyrical pictures of time/place i would say. =
 plus he totally slips at least 4 or 5 direct references to star wars in=
 every song, no shit.  it's good stuff overall i'd say.  the cockney accent=
 is totally awesome too.

>
>black star I've heard of but I haven't heard any of their stuff.
>

i just grabbed their cd about a week ago, don't know when it was released=
 tho, i think it's pretty recent.  it's on rawkus if that gives you an idea=
 of the sound...mos def is pretty laid back and not too dense, sorta like=
 lewis parker, and talib kweli is TOTALLY dense, spitting out stuff faster=
 than you can imagine, totally like kook g rap on that first track of the=
 unkle album.  plus mos def does these choruses with a really raga style=
 voice, and he actually has  a really nice singing voice if you ask me. =
 their beats are a lot thinner, think of tribe called quest style stuff,=
 with a lot less background atmosphere and not quite so lush arrangements...=
just the essentials with some good scratching every once in awhile. =
 everybody is hyping them to be the thing that could possibly break the=
 cycle of no-talent cookie cutter crap in hip hop right now such as will=
 smith/puff daddy/lordtariq/mase/nolimit stuff, but to be honest, i doubt it=
 will actually do that.  is a nice album though...there are some really good=
 tracks on it, like this one respiration that mos def was mostly responsible=
 that hits the nail on the head for how i felt when i was living in dc last=
 semester.  the song is about how the city is like an 'organism' in that it=
 lives and breathes...and the chorus is good, it really does move me...
"so much on my mind that i can't recline, blasted holes in the night til she=
 bled sunshine, breathe in inhale vapors from bright stars that shine,=
 breathe out weed smoke retrace the skyline, don't the bass ride out like an=
 ancient mating call?  I can't take it y'all, i can feel the city breathing=
 chest heaving against the flesh of the evening, kiss the eyes goddbye i'm=
 on the last train leaving."
it's sooooo good to hear people writing lyrics that aren't just=
 self-promoting and typically ghetto-star stuff like most other hip-hop.

i reccomend checking out both.

Whenever we go up to Toronto, the kids there are like WHERE did you get
those PANTS ?!?  The way people dress for raves there is very much more
club-influenced.  

My friend Jenny was wearing her 40inchers while we were doing record
shopping, walking around town during the day.  Without any exaggeration
here, she had at least 50 people stare at her in shock.  You'd just watch
someone go by (or someone on the other side of the road!) look at her,
their stare would go down, their eyes would bulge out, and their jaws would
drop.  Ha!  Girl knows how to dress to get a reaction!

You know a bunch of the kids were at their mall that afternoon saying, but
don't you have anything wider?

      i have one thing to say in this debate: to the
      raver, phat pants are a dance accessory - to the
      non-raving public, phat pants are a obscurely
      hip fashion accessory. 

      to me, they are both. so there.

This, unfortunately should not be considered organizing.
But rather, an answer to a plea for help from a sick friend
in desperate need of our support and love.
>From which she will undoubtably know that
the love and support of our combined efforts is Real,
creating a positive influence in her time of need.

Time in this instance, was not on our side.
Being a medical emergency, we were forced
to make a decision encorperating and utilizing
as many of opportunities we could,
in the short time we had.

I personally believe, there is no pb scene,
nor is their a cleve scene
we create together _one_scene_

Many feel Pittsburgh is family,
and sincerely hope you can come out,
as it was originally, and still is
your Party.  Sorry, I sukk. . .
Many thanks to all you down
people showing your support.

By opening the channels of support
and communication between the two,
We can visualize goals to reach a solution.
We must share with each other.
It is imperative we contribute our help to one another.
We grow individually in doing so.
Thus allowing us to come together
creating Unity.
Which has in turn set the foundations for this
movement to be set in motion.
Look how this represents _our_scene_ as a whole.

After hours of discussion, HOS John and I felt it was in
both of our best interests to work together given the
circumstances, to achieve the utmost support possible.

On our behalf, this event is being thrown for a good cause.
A simple request of a new lease on life.  We are working
to help cover medical expenses, as well show our support.

On House of Styles behalf, John is complying to a very large
request/favor caused by medical emergencies, shortage of time and
lack of communication between the two of us.
I want to make certain John gets the recognition he deserves.
There isn't an arrangement of words to describe the respect
I have for he and Glenn.  All I can do is express my UPMOST,
DEEPEST THANKS once again to House of Styles.
You are REAL.

To those out there that feel John has slighted you in any way,
at this point, I hope you understand.
I am sorry for the uprising this has caused in the mass of pg.

There are many local production companies, crews, and scenesters,
contributing in their own special way.  We want to express
our gratitude and extend our deepest thanks to all for their support.
All help is recognized, and appreciated.  THANKS

I only ask that you try to see where we stand, and what we're up
against,
and choose to show your support.
Hopefully this sheds some light on the situation,
and answers all your questions, if not
refer your questions to contacting us via our web site
-it is imparitive you include Jenn in the Subject: field.

Keep the word real.
Jenn

This, unfortunately really should not be considered organizing.
It is more a desperate attempt to help somebody live
the rest of their life outside of, and free from pain, fear, and
loneliness.
Giving her a chance to enjoy and celebrate her life,
rather than slowly fade and wilt away.

Perhaps my heart is simply too big.  We were _asked_ to do this,
she came to us
in search of means which would allow her to live the rest of her life as

fully and completely as possible.  My purpose in life is happiness.
To find the real.  To share.  This just happens to be the date that
everything was coming together the best for us.
Unfortunately, time isn't cooperating with us.  We would like
more time, it is simply not an option.

John and I thought that both parties would do all right by themselves,
but why take away from one rather than complimenting the other.
As well as how it represents _our_scene_ as a whole.

This charity is being thrown for  good cause.
The simple wish to have a new lease on life,
adding hope to what would have been an otherwise
harsh, dreary, outcome in which death was victorious.
Death will eventually take us all, each at our own turn.
She is requesting a bit more time,  the ability to experience life, and
ultimatly the kindness of the people for which this all represents.


When working together, we draw from each of our own particular
specialties, thus magnifying the outcome and intensifying the VIBE.
We are working together, giving what we can, for what we feel
is the only thing to do.
There are many local production companies and scenesters,
contributing in their own special way.  We want to express
and extend our deepest thanks to all for their support.

support.

I'm sorry, i forgot to mention that the haunted house tours are in Pittsburgh,
and the cost is $8 or $5 if you are a student.  I went last year and if you go
you will hear some really good ghost stories, and maybe if your lucky you will
see an apparition like i did.  Remember the date is Oct 24th. let me know if
you want to go.

commericals that violate EVERYONES musical interests. Such as the swing one,
the rap one, the funk one and I don't know what else. So I don't think they
speciafically are picking out rave.
And MTV.... They use jungle and stuff in the backgorund of quick intro and
advertisement.. cuz the beat is good background music .for a 30 second
flash... but don't think any of the regular MTV watchers could tolerate or
understand 8 hours of it at a time like we are used to. And stuff like that
is not catchy enough to make videos out of.
And I recently read an article about MTV in 'Spin" or Rolling Stone or
something... it said basically that MTV was again cutting its videos
shorter,, and featuring the only ones with ultra-mainstream appeal.. such as
mariah carey, madonna and non ganster, pop type rap acts. Because simply.
They were not making enouh money on the other  stuff anymore. As in,
"electronica" was supposed to be the big thing but actually as it is turning
out, it isnt.  And what other non-mainstream music interest hasn't mtv
exploited for a short passing time?
And if you are scared of the Gap selling big pants.
I don't think it is a big deal-and I never thought big pants was such a
'rave-specific' style. Skaters, Hardcore people, rappers and even some goths
have always worn them, as long as I have seen.. I mean I saw more JNCOS and
Kickwear,  at the warped tour this summer than all the raves I have ever
been to, combined. It was almost a uniform. Ravers tend to have more
individuality in the kind of pants they wear. And they are worn in a totally
different sense and way then wide legged pants from the gap. I mean 2 people
can wear the same pants and still look absolutely nothing like each other.

Think of the 'swing craze'. That is ten thousand times more horrible to the
people who have been going to swing club for ages.. I saw this special on
VH1 about 'swing' and it told people about music and dancing.. but then even
went on to..
"How to get the Swing style" like .. you will look very 'hip' in these
'gladrags' like putting definition of swingers terminology on the screen and
showing people the cloths they needed to be hip..
can you imagine something like that with ravers/???? Like instructing people
on how to get the 'cool' clothes and moves and even how to tlak like a
'raver'..

I don't think MTV will ever go to far as too expoit the rave scene. If it is
, it is just a passing thing. .because that is how it is with everything..
with techno I think the music doesn't carry universal appeal enough to keep
the attention span of the followers of the world. And even if it does..
there will still always be underground parties.. because if things are
getting 'soldout' , if noone bothers to recreat awesome underground parties
than the scene is really dead..
And I don't think it will be. Half the people I meet and talk to at my
college barely even know what a rave is.

INTERNAL - 10.10.98 - Columbus, Ohio

PRE-PARTY BS

I didn't even know i was going to this party 'til Ben (DJ Atman)
called me up & said he could get me in for free since Jeff (Fluid)
had asked him to spin...Nicole had already jetted, so i called up
Julia...When we got to Ben's, Tomo (Lotek) and Jed were there
hangin out...Jed lived up the street, so we bounced over there
where we hooked up w/ jerry, crow, & this other girly...after 
chillin there for a bit, we caravaned down to the party...

I knew we were off to a bad start when the door dude searched my
pockets & found 2 cans of Busch beer i tried sneakin in...door
dude: "uhm, what are these?"...me: "oh, my canned food donations
for the homeless!"...ironically, the door dude ended up pocketing
my beer...then to make matters worse, he said he couldn't find 
ben on the guest list...

so we're there outside waiting for one of the other door dudes 
to find jeff (fluid) in the party...luckily, my italian friend 
tina (tinarave) and her buddy scott came out to keep us company...
finally i got sick of waiting & paid the $15 to get in (mostly
cuz i felt guilty i didn't hafta pay to get into Ohio Players
the night before)...i'm sorry, but i really didn't feel this
was a $15 party, mebbe a $10 party especially w/ 2 canned food
donations of beer, which the door dude pocketed!...tee hee,
luckily he didn't search my back pocket where i hid my 3rd can
o beer, which i happily popped open after gettin in...

inside i find nicole hangin out w/ adare, mike, and jason...i give
her the binky she had forgotten (sometimes my roomy is so candy
it disgusts me!)...but what really irks me is how she wore my
porn star hat, my plaid polo long sleeve, my paco men's cologne,
bustin some of the liquid moves i taught her & was able to pick
up more guys that night than any other night (she told me 8 different 
guys hit on her that night)...duz dis mean that what rave 
dudes are really lookin for is a female version of me?!...scarey!... 
oh btw, any rave girlys lookin to pick up more rave boys @ partys
can contact me for private lessons @ steviet216@aol.com!...discount 
for list members!...(porn cru, membership has its priveledges...
just ask amy funkybizz!)

MUSIC

i was dissapointed we missed Tim Madonna's set especially since he
was one of the kids i knew when he first got into this scene (in
fact i gave him one of his first happy hardcore tracks "i wanna
have sex with madonna"...mebbe dats why he has such an eclectic
quirky style nowadaze)...but what ticked julia off was that she 
was told bob sfero was supposed to go on @ 1:30am...welp, we found
out why the other door dude couldn't find Jeff, he had decided to
bump Bob & spin himself!...granted he had a nice tribal set, but
how lame!...we should've figured since when he didn't have ben on
the guest list!...i talked w/ joe blunt, apparently he got bumped
too!...we went downstairs and dac crowell had a nice li'l live
thingy goin on down there...but the set of the night went to jay
goodwill...phenomenal!...prolly the only time i really threw down,
way in the back by nicole & her friends...i hate dancing up front
or in a circle...too much pressure...oh yah anutha pleasant surprise
was jordan from fresno (coinkidinkly where my folks live out in
california)...julia was finally appeased when bob sfero spun a nice
jazzy house set downstairs...

THE PEOPLE

only list member i remember bumpin into besides amy (funkybizz) was
matt (hostler) and benny (bensoc)...had fun dancin w/ breaker john
from rec shop...oh yah, breaker dan & the rec shop cru can now be
seen usually on fridays @ red zone...go & check 'em out, they've all
got mad skillz!...bumped into jack (funkdoktah) & his fly girly
again...jack suggested that he was the "player of the month" as
opposed  to "player of the week"...welp, usually jack's relationships
don't last that long, so we'll see...runner up would go to michael
mccusty who picked up the girl i was talkin a bit to @ submerge!... 
man, i've decided i've got to de-"lunafy" myself & get away from
trainspotting & get back to where it's really at!...all those fly 
girlys at partys!...dayum, what was i thinkin?...people over 
machines any day!...oh yah, boo & hiss award goes to: Tomo (Lotek),
who decided to jet early, so me, julia, & ben had to find other 
rides back!...dissapointed i missed trevor & ben's set becuz nicole
wanted to leave early, but alas i've learned partying TOO late is
not good for the health AND not good for people who live a non-
nocturnal lifestyle (nope, not all ravahs are vampires!)...

I agree with the comment below.  MTV is just basically using Crystal Method's
music because it sounds good.  I don't think their intention was to exploit the
rave scene.  After all it is true that scateboarders, rappers, and many other
groups like to wear baggy pants.  I don't think the scene is going to suffer.
It would be different if all of a sudden you see a warehouse full of peeps
jumping up and down with glow sticks, and an ADIDAS logo flying through the
screen.

I haven't seen that one.  Now that definetly constitutes mainstream exploitation!
Especially since I am a raver and a latino...  But still I think that the scene
will always be for the few who love techno, and love to hang with good people.
"Regular Bar Joe's"  <I don't mean to offend anyoneas I also go to regular bars
from time to time> for the most part don't even know what a rave is unless they
read about it in a distorted magazine article or a lying news bit.  Most people
think that all we do is get high, and have wild orgies at these horrible events.
Maybe someone should write an article in a newspaper stating how nobody fights at
raves, or how friendly people are, or tell them what PLUR is, etc.  Still I say
the commercials will get old and they'll choose another fad to exploit, meanwhile
we'll keep on partying, and having fun...

i must commend you for helping me visualize this [the adidas logo] with
your narrative.  it was very funny.  well, maybe i just made it really
funny.  either way i laughed out loud in the academic computer science
cluster (ACS Cluster).  comparative to pitt's (CIS)

Well, Matt (ratfink) & I were gonna write a joint review of these two
parties, but since I'm sitting here, and it's already tuesday, I'll just do
it myself. Matt, just add whatever I forgot...

Sting 16:
This was the DC stop of the Moonshine Records tour. We didn't get there
until about 1 AM, which sucked, 'cuz we only got to hear Cirrus' last song.
I was a little wierded out when I first walked in (I always feel that way
at Buzz), but about ten minutes after we got there, RATFINK comes strolling
up!!! Absolutely the last person I expected to see. He had driven like 8
hours to get there. He was with a friend from Kent... DAMNIT!! I forgot
your name AGAIN!!! <sorry> :( We had one of those awesome jumping up and
down screaming hugging meetings, you know, the kind where everyone else
around just looks at you and thinks, "awwww.... I wish that was me!!!" 
  So after that I went insane. A few of my other friends were there, too,
and I was just insanely happy all night. I kept trying to convince people
that I was completely sober (which I was), but no one would believe me. I
was that happy. I think I had a much better time than everyone else, so I
can't have much objectivity about the vibe. I thought it was pretty good
(for Buzz, anyway), but I was radiating so much insanity that night that
people probably didn't have a choice but to talk to me.  

   What i heard of Cirrus sounded awesome!!
    AK 1200 was really good, too, but I missed most of it.

   CARL COX KICKED MY ASS ALL OVER THE PLACE. That's about all I can say.
He spun a 3- hour set, hard and fast the whole way through, and I could not
stop dancing. His selection was a bit repetitive, but I didn't get bored
with it, although I heard some complaints.

I didn't pay attention to most of the other DJs (couldn't find the lineup
anywhere), but all the music was really, really good.
Over all, it was a really good time. I_almost_felt like I was at a real
party, not a club.
We left at about 6:30, only to find that my tire was completely flat. We
had to drive the whole way home (3 1/2 hours) on a donut spare. Big suck!!

So I spent most of Saturday in the car. Matt convinced me to go to
Internal, and I had planned on getting some sleep when I got home, but I
had to go get a new tire, then go pick my father up at the airport in
Pittsburgh, so I didn't get to sleep at all. We finally got on the road to
Columbus at about 9:30 PM.

We got to Internal at about 1:30. 
The venue was a little too dark for my taste, especially downstairs, but it
wasn't bad. It was also pretty dirty, but I've seen worse. I'm just sad
because my Teletubby doll is all covered with black funk now. I have to
wash him. 
The music was good all night... Jordan, I LOVED YOUR SET!!!! 
I wish there had been more people dancing, seemed like everyone was sitting
around. Other than that, the vibe was pretty good. Everyone was really nice
and friendly. Seemed to be a really young crowd, but maybe I'm just getting
old... 
This was my friend's first party, and he had a good time, but he was really
tired, so he ended up sitting in the car for most of the night.  He told me
later that people kept coming up to the car and talking to him all night. I
thought that was really, really cool.
The only list kids I saw were Matt and Benny, and the Lovelabs crew (but
they live in my town, so I see them all the time).
Over all, another good party to round out my weekend. Thanks, Matt, for
convincing me to go!!!

So... WOW, I had a great weekend. Thanks to all who made it so cool!!!!
Sorry this review is so long and rambling. I write much more coherently
when I have something to complain about...

Love,
Amber

Just wondering if there are any party kids in the Ohio U area.  I haven't
found too many that are willing to go on road trips.  If you're out there,
e-mail me back.  Also what are everyone's thoughts on The Best Party on the
23?

Those cats were Kim and Moke.  They're not on the list, but Kim's e-mail is
partykid@neo.lrun.com   and Moke's is sbg@neo.lrun.com  .  I'll forward
your e-mail to them.  (They're planning on bringing popsicles to Magick
also.)

Recently, mskw and I were in the Strip (DeLuca's rocks my world) and we
decided to stop in the little bookstore next door to DeLuca's (it's on
Penn Ave.).  We were browsing and we came across this book called
"Portrait of a Generation/the Love Parade Family Book" by Alfred Steffen.
This photographer set up a little studio right in the middle of the '96
LP and sent out assistants to collect interesting looking people.  There
are over 100 different people including a family of three, Carl Cox and
many many ravers.  I don't think there's anyone dressed raver-esque as we
know it.  They're all wearing something original or odd or beautiful or
amazing.  The photos include quotes from the subject.  Some of them are
thought provoking, some are amusing, some are just silly.  If you're in
the Strip, stop by and at least thumb through this book.

Hellz yeah... Anyone remember how you had to go up to the second floor to go
to the bathroom, and unless someone showed you the "secret" door to the dark
stairway, you werent going to find it. Then toward the end of the night, some
mysterious liquid was leaking from the second floor onto the chill room??
heheh...damn that was foul. I couldnt find anyone I knew the whole damn night,
except for those I came with. I am looking forward to this year though, being

What I couldn't understand was why the plethora of cops patrolling the
place never ventured up to the nitrous room. There had to be at least
50 kids up there -- including a drum circle -- and of course there was
the continual sound of balloons filling and balloons popping.  Oh, and
every time someone new walked in one of the kids over by the tanks
kept shouted, "Does ANYONE HAVE any E?!!!"

So wait -- was there really a hidden bathroom in that place?  That's
news to me.

Anyway, that sure was one fun party -- it's definitely in my top 10. 
I hope this year's Get Freaky measures up.

--Amanda

I agree with this all the way...There are always going to be new people
coming into the scene.  And if the scene is about the love, the unity,
the peace, and the respect, then we should welcome the nebies with open
arms.  Everyone was a newbie at one time, and if you had a bad
experience, like people making fun of you, of acting as if they started
the scene, you wouldn't have gone back and found out what it's all about.
What we should do is to welcome the newcomers, and show them what it's
all about.  I think it's cool as hell to meet a person at a party, where
it's there first one, because it usually means that they are openminded
enough to try something new, and curious as to what's going on, usually. 
I think that if we emphasize on all of the bad things that go on in the
scene, the will begin to get worse. Focus on the positives and spread
them to the newbies, then eventually the negatives will begin to weaken. 
Consider the newbies as children, and we have to teach the children what
it's all about.  If we make fun of them, then they will believe that that
is the way, and the scene will become this egotistical, judgemental,
battleground.
  And really, who gives a shit if everyone is wearing phat pants or not,
if you like 'em wear 'em.  If you are out to be "different" you are being
the same as everyone else who is "different." Just be yourself.
peace.

i, for one, am dumbfounded that anyone in their right mind would want to
_relive_ that terrible party.  cold, wet, no lights, no ventilation, no
bathrooms (hence the piles of SHIT in the corners), generator _indoors_
(!!), and lots of electrical cords laying in puddles.  nice.

and people gladly PAYED $30 to enter this enchanted wonderland.

_this_ is what i'm talking about when i say the rave scene is dead.  when
an entire scene can long for the return of such a BAD party as GET FREAKY
2 (not to mention the return of wilhelm k, widely despised in the midwest
for being shady and promoting east-coast candy raves), we've turned some
kind of corner.  sorry guys, i just can't turn that corner with you...
you're on your own!

having said that, it can be interesting (even galvanizing) to go through
that kind of experience and still have "fun."  but there are limits, and i
think GET FREAKY 2 surpassed all of them.


IMPORTANT PS: ele_mental columbus is NOT affiliated with the promoters of
GET FREAKY 3, who are calling themselves "the element squad."  i repeat:
ele_mental columbus is in NO WAY, SHAPE, or FORM, affiliated with "the
element squad."  just a polite reminder.

i defintely like what jason has to say considering i am a newbie
myself (my first party will be Channel Jive) and if i came into a
party where everyone sort of just shrugged me off or treated me as if
i was an outsider, I would automatically turn right around and head
back to my car, but I can tell that y'all are much better than that,
and that's why i wanna get into the party scene.  it's not because of
"phat pants" - i don't even own a pair! i love the music and i
defintely love the vibe i get from y'all.  I can't way to get into
"the family" even though ill probably feel like a brother right from
the start.

Here's one for the real-audio listeners...sorry if you don't have it...

I listen to alot of real-audio radio...what can i say i'm a computerlab
flunky so i've got alot of spare time.  And of all the spots on the net, i
have to say, without a doubt the best spot for all kinds of stuff is

www.pseudo.com

I can't say enough about them.  They know underground culture and aren't
selling it short...or using big corps to support themselves (as far as i
can tell).  They have lots and lots of different shows, from ones about
radical feminism, conspiracy/weirdness, lots of computer nerd stuff,
underground movies, and lots of music stuff, including an awesome jungle
show (hosted by dj dara with guest djs every week including big names),
a global house show, lots of *good* hiphop, a nice funk+oldskool show, an
asian/indian dancemusic show, rockabilly and deathmetal...probably
something else i'm forgetting.

Definitely check it out.

Segway....
  I'm experimenting with making real-audio files myself, so i'm putting 
up a jungle remix i'm working on...test it out and lemme know what you
think. :)

This is a story of a pair of healthy phat pants who became an addict, but survived its addiction only to rise from the ashes like the phoenix....

There once was a pair of happy phat pants, the phat pants loved to party and could be seen dancing at every party. The pants loved to dance in front of the DJ table, so everyone could how the pants swished and swirled. Till one night when the phat pants met mr. dingy dealer pants.....mr. dingy dealer pants said "try what I have hidden in my pockets" so the impressionable phat pants happily popped everything mr. dingy dealer pants had to offer. Gradually, after a few partys happy phat pants was no longer going to parties to dance, swish and swirl, happy phay pants was going to find mr. dingy dealer pants. See, happy phat pants no longer went to parties to dance, as a matter of fact happy phat pants was now oblivious to any of the surroundings, happy phat pants lived to find mr. dingy dealer pants. Soon, happy phat pants was no longer happy, happy phat pants was no longer phat either. happy phat pants was now depressed boot cut jeans. depressed boot cut jeans could now be seen at parties crawling in the muck searching for anything to give mr.dingy dealer pants for his magic party pills. then one night it happened, depressed bootcut jeans, while crawling thru 'da muck caught a sorry glimpse of a some stone washed levi's 501 jeans. It was a mirror, derpressed bootcut jeans broke down into tears. Just when depressed bootcut jeans thought it was all over, bootcut's old friends, fun visor kid, and big backpack showed up with a magic happy sticker and a sucker. Depressed bootcut jeans was instantly transformed back into happy phat pants, and forgot all about mr.dingy dealer pants. The trio, then skipped up to the DJ table to dance, swish and swirl together once again. and the were happy.--------

------I bet quite a few people are now asking themselves "i know there is a moral lesson here" actully there is not, this is the radom idleness, and piss poor attempt at procrastination by some with a 7 pagepaper due tommorrow at 2:00.  ---------------------- If you are worried about happy phats pants, don't be, everything is fine now.---- And as far as mr.dingy dealer pants goes, all I can say is at least we got the flight booked in time. ------

-----see everyone friday------

i keep flyers for the parties i'm considering on my frig, and flyers for stuff
i'm not going to *on* the frig - like on the top.  over the summer, the side
with stuff i went to was just madness - mostly 3"x5" two-tone dills.  then
when classes started it was like, bare frig ... partly cos i couldn't go to as
many events, mostly cos there wasn't much going on.  but now i have like half
a dozen tabloid-sized glossy full-color foldout popup hologram flyers for
events that im probably not going to.

i used to be attracted by pretty colors and cute graphics, but i don't know
these days, it's like, ... ... ... i don't know.  it seems like all they want
is money money money, and so they're probably going not going to care about
the party experience.  like i'll look at one of these and say to myself, this
could definitely be one of those parties with 3,000 kids and no running water.
except for <<energize>> and <<buzz>>.  but <<get freaky 3>> i am definitely
suspicious about.  it looks pretty and the lineup is dope but the preflyer was
wayeee too similar to <<getto booty battle>>.  i mean i had a great time at
that party but smiles were sparse.

i'm totally not saying <<get freaky>> is gonna suck, actually i rilly wanna
go, but i'm just not sure yet.  it looks so bomb, but first i gotta checka
checkit ouuut.  does anyone know anything about the kids throwing it?  i can't
remember who they are.

It's not the dirt and shit and cold and darkness I so want to

Why? Because I had a lot of fun in spite of all that was wrong. I
have been to 'better' parties that weren't nearly as good a time.

I have been following this story for quite some time and am not quite
certain as to my take on it.

Let me say up front that I have a business interest in this party.  I not
only own a record store in Cleveland (Grand Poo-bas) but I also am a 4 year
resident DJ at the club this event is rumored to be taking place in.  With
that in mind, I shall tell my story:

Last Saturday I received a call from Kathy Frank.  She was looking for a
record, and she wanted to know about the possibility of the store donating
headphones to her so she could play at the benefit fame records is throwing
for her at trilogy.  Because I usually somehow seem to find out about things
going on at Trilogy, and had not heard about this event, I told her I would
think about it (while I checked the validity of this event).  Upon checking
the story out, I was told not to worry about it and that things were far
from definite about this event taking place.

Now I don't know if any of you know Kathy Frank, but she indeed has a sad
story.  She has been through quite a bit of tragedy in her life.  She also
had a heart attack 2 weeks ago.  She is stricken with either MS or Leukemia
(I can't remember which :/)  She gets really good drugs, which she was
talking about selling to make some extra money.   She is not expected to
live long, and according to the doctors she has long outlived her
expectancy.  Maybe many of you remember her?  There was quite a bit of talk
about her many months ago when Keoki played at SeXX.  She was the woman who
stood out front entertaining everyone and "heading up the line".  It was her
graduation party and Keoki was playing it because she had asked him to play
at her funeral.   It even got mentioned in a California newspaper.  Kathy
really does have a tragic story and I am quite surprised she didn't tell me
about this benefit when I saw her at the Moonshine tour 2 Sundays ago.  I
think it's really cool that all the promoters let her in for free and that
she has all the energy to get up and go to parties as often as she does.  I
mean, hell yeah! to someone who can be out raving 10 days after a heart
attack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Let me tell you now about Sandy.   Sandy is a woman who roams Lakewood.  She
is a fairly familiar face if your ever on the streets in Lakewood.  She's
usually yelling at someone, talking to herself, complaining about why they
"didn't just kill her", or something strange.  She shaved her head sometime
in the middle of the summer and she's quite a collector of things.  She
usually stops by the store about once a week, comes in, sits down, and talks
about things which sometimes I understand, and sometimes I don't.  From what
I have heard, she is mentally ill and when she is on medication she is fine
and when she is not she is pretty crazy.  She can't always afford her
medication, though.  The previous owner of the store called her "Annie" for
Annie Oakley -- but I made the effort to find her real name.  She comes in,
usually straightens up the magazines and the flyers and re-arranges the
bulletin board.  For her efforts I give her $2 and she takes some flyers to
add to her collection.  I don't think she knows what they mean... she just
likes the pictures and graphics and words have some strange power over her.
>From our conversations, I have gathered that she was once married, possibly
even had kids at one point.  Maybe even a real job??? She seems to have a
strong interest in accounting.   I never ask here to leave, though sometimes
it is embarrassing when customers come in and see her sitting there.  I soon
forget about my embarrassment when customers start to make faces at me, and
make fun of her.  And ravers are JUST as guilty of doing that as anyone.  I
don't even know if she has a home.  I'd like to do something nice for her
and make her some extra money -- maybe find her a job cleaning up at a party
or something.  I certainly think that throwing a benefit for her is out of
the question.

You may ask how I dare to compare these two people, since their situations
are NOTHING alike.  Well if I did want to throw a benefit for Sandy and
decided to go do it in Pittsburgh, I wonder what people would say?  I know
if I (as a record store owner) were going to throw a benefit in Columbus, I
would be calling Culture 7 and asking if they wanted to be involved.  If
Mike's reputation for being one of the "good guys" in this scene did not
precede him, then I would wonder if the ulterior motive behind this move is
just to say "I threw a party at trilogy".

Something just does not seem quite right.  Why is the person for whom this
benefit is being held calling me about it??   How was she able to be at a
rave when 10 days previous her heart had stopped?  Why are people in
Pittsburgh (2 hours away) canceling parties because of this?   Why was I
told this wasn't even a fully confirmed party by the supposed venue?    Why
Cleveland?  Why Trilogy?  Let's face it... it's a public relations move for
the business... but why in Cleveland and not in the home town???  Why does
this seem to be such a big deal on the list this week?   All things taken
into consideration something does not weigh out right.  I don't want to
sound like I'm trying to be bitter or anything like that.  I am %100 for
helping someone out, but I also realize you can't help everyone out.  That's
why you donate to a charity who CAN help everyone out (provided people are
actually getting the money).  Once again... the stories just don't weigh
out.  Or maybe I'm not getting the whole story???????

<<There was quite a bit of talk about her many months ago when Keoki played
at SeXX. >>

What offends me is I saw the girl at Phunction a few weeks later. I was
heading to the bathroom when I saw her stumbling the same way. I asked her
if she needed some help. She ignored me. She finally got to the bathroom and
she was begging for people to get out of the stall so she could puke. Being
that I was probably the oldest and a maybe a more responsable person than
the average 16yr old , I suggested to everyone in the bathroom that maybe we
should call 911. I learned about her condition (MS) at Sexx, so I also had
that thought in mind. She was not looking good at all....I actually had
never seen someone look that bad. So since the majority of the bathroom
seemed as if they didn't understand what the hell was going on I decided to
say "fuck it" and go about my buisness. So I left the bathroom not feeling
right about my decision and began to discuss what I had seen and ect ect.
ONLY to figrue out the girl had done coke, acid, meth and something
else....I can't remember what.
I think it's so fucked up to throw a charity event for this girl. I mean I
too am all about helping the next person, but maybe if she wouldn't buy so
many other fuckin drugs she might have money to buy her medication. I don't
have any money either...I buy my e and whatever else here and there, but no
one is throwing me a charity event cause I can't afford my car payment or
whatever cause I was so fuckin dumb and bought drugs...

Hi Kids, i was just thinking that we have the basis for a good organization,
such as helping out with charity events, or as a group telling promoters what
kind of a rave we would like, to just doing things like Andy the pooh's bar-b-
q . i know as a group we can influence the rave scene for the better and keep
out shady characters the rave is not just about music and lights, it is about
people.  I mean there would not be a 
pb-cle list if it was just about the music.  So it would be nice if we could
have more get together out side of the NET meets. The more things we do
together the better we can get to know each other.  The other thing i thought
or is a small flyer, maybe on a business card letting people know how to
subscribe to PB-CLE raves.  We could hand these out at the parties when
someone ask about our laminates.  If we get a large enough or a group we can
have our name on the flyers as PB-CLE endorsed rave..any how that is my take
on the situation i welcome as much feed back as you can give
me..p.L.u.R...{;-) mark

This is a great idea.  This way new people can join in freely, and there is a way
of keeping undesireables (i.e. gang members, bad attitudes) out of the scene.  If
we can have strong enough numbers to have any kind of influeze even if is minimal,
then maybe we can prevent what has happened to the Florida, Denver, DC, and many
other areas where having a rave is a hassle to happen here.  I don't know if it
will do enough, but you know what they say about safety in numbers!  You never
know maybe the label "Endorsed by PB-CLE raves" could mean something in the
future.  Perhaps it could mean the difference between a great rave or a mediocre
one.  All I know is that this seems like a good thing to try.

Great idea!
Chances are there will be a table or something @ MAGICK! we could use this
as a base and people could come and some of us could answer questions etc.
I KNOW there are some kcikass graphic designers lurking out there more or
less, so lets go out and get organized! Well unless you think the list is
already big enough, which could be a valid point. In which case maybe just
some random ubiquitous handouts would be more appropriate and if ppl are
really interested they could visit the url and figure things out rtfm
style. Anyways I got stuff to do!
ttyl and plur,
jbrick

PS At illusions I saw some truskool handouts which I forgot to pick up
afterwards, oh well.

i love the idea....as for the flyers....i think ratfink had some made
up....the design is at

ratfink@en.com

check it out.....i know i would love to hear ppl say....this party is one
worth going to....the vibe should be good, the space is legal, and
everything should be safe....all from seeing a little pb-cle logo in the
corner of a flyer....

spread light....keep out the shade

and remember what PLUR stands for!!!

so with all this talk of organizing as a group and all, i came up with
what i think is an excellent idea...

with the recent success of the organization B.T.S. (brooklyn thug
squad), i was thinking we could start up some sort of pb-cle.T.S... we
could all work indipendantly, collaborating to control the
distribution of drugs at raves, and if someone non-pb-cle.T.S. was
trying to sell, we could kick their asses, and leave them as a bloody
mess in a corner, or back alley. with all of the promoters on here, we
could surely get something going! downlow... interested? you guys have
the connections necessary to get this underground network started. we
could completely dominate the scene... i can see it now!

we can use all of the money we make to throw bigger parties, and get
out of town kids to come, then we can rob 'em of their money and
drugs, and continue the cycle!

anyone interested please email me privately.

this joke was brought to you in part by the letter B, the number 6,
and...

...frankie g

Mark is right....there is more we can all accomplish as a unified group.  The
numbers we have, but we should start getting to know eachother better, and see
what each one can contribute to OUR scene.  I have not seen a shady prick on
this list yet, so that is a GREAT start!!!  We should have gatherings like
Andy's get together, which I missed unfortunately, more often.  Raves should
not be our excuse to hang out or whatnot.  I will most likely write more on
this subject later, but I am not writing my paper due tomorrow morning which I
should do!  peace

Hugh

Dear God. By now I should hope that anyone who has been to any C.O.K. 
Midwest function would know NOT to attend another. This is a bad thing 
kids...a very bad thing. Fact is, Pharsyde very well might have broken 
up, but that doesn't stop Wilhelm from putting them on the flyer. Just 
because they're on Wilhelm's flyers doesn't mean the person/crew has 
ever been booked, ever will be booked, or Wilhelm ever had any intention 
of booking them. I hate to spread bad vibes about, but this is one case 
where I will stand firm. Too many close associates have been screwed 
over by Wilhelm and C.O.K. Midwest and I would advise anyone to keep 
clear of these parties.

kinda like a "pb-cle seal of approval"?  That would be cool . . .

> on the situation i welcome as much feed back as you can give

Personally I still like the idea of having a big ass pb-cle party. 
I'm not talking about like Andy's BBQ (not dissing that, I had a
blast, just not what I'm talking about), I'm talking about renting out
a warehouse or something (considering it's gettin' cold), and having a
big ass party.  I mean let's see what we would need:

sound: check
graphic design: check
cheap flyers: check
DJs: check
people and lots of friends: check

lights: not so good . . . although somebody said they did lasers. 
what's a decent light show cost?
$$ for space: not so good either

I'm not saying I'm gonna go and initiate all this, cause of various
reasons, but it just seems like: we have the resources and I think we
have the people, so why not do it?

later,

absolut

Part of me wants to like the pb-cle collective idea.  Like most human
beings I suppose I just want to belong and be important and looked up to
by other human beings.  But as much as it pains me to say this, this idea
sounds really elitest.  Does that make sense to anyone?  If anyone thinks
they can convince me otherwise, by all means reply.  

Jenifer Foulmood

ps I DO think a pb-cle party would be really nifty, as conflicting as that
is to my above opinion.

Let's do it...let's organize. Not everyone on the list has the hook-ups 
-- like me, rarely leaving the house -- but we all could contribute 
something.....me....--> time and passion. I've just recently gotten in 
the scene...in meaning that I was into raves and "underground" music 
since 1991, but considerind I was 13 in 1991 (and were most of my 
friends) and going through family situations, I couldn't get involved in 
the scene more than just buying some magazines and reading about it in 
London. I really wished I would've talked more and made more friends 
before....that's why I am speaking up a little bit now. I believe we as 
a group can make a difference. I want to be a part of that difference. 
we're all cool. I need to meet more of you!!!!!!

umm...I haven't heard any recent soul coughing stuff but, I'm pretty
sure they don't play drum & bass(the genre that is.)  inpgh's new issue
seems to think they do(they spend about a third of the article giving a
brief overview of jungle and stating how soul coughing "may be the most
important group to utilize drum & bass").

/me is confussled.

is there any explanation for this...or did frank joseph(the writer) fuck

So far this is who may be going on the tour in Pittsburgh:

MrRab@AOL.com  aka mark
microchipgirl@hotmail.com (Donnell Williams)
andythepooh@hotmail.com (andy the pooh)?
Don the guy that works security at the front door at most raves
NEXT?

<< Hi Kids, are you ready to get scared? In a previous E-mail (listed below) I
 talked about a tour of REAL haunted houses. Well it is that time of year
 again. A guided walking tour of the Allegheny West neighborhood will be held
 on Oct 24th , If anyone is interested going let me know.  We can meet
 somewhere then go on the tour.The cost is $8 or $5 if you are a student
 The tour is called "Spirits of Old Allegheny" 

 (PREVIOUS E-MAIL)
 In reference to your discussion about life after death, I happen to know for
a
 fact that there is an existence after death.  I heard all the ghost stories,
 and stories about angels and sighting of the virgin Mary, but I was
85%certain
 that there is life after death.  The 15% uncertainty bothered me, until I
went
 on a tour of haunted houses on the North side of Pittsburgh, the people at
the
 house said that most of the "ghost" activity revolved around the main stair
 well.  So while the rest of the people looked around the house and antiques I
 focused on the stair well.  Before I knew it something humanoid in shape but
 fuzzy gray in translucent color whisked by at the top of the steps about 15ft
 in front of me.  I didn't say anything at first, but I told my girlfriend a
 little later.  She told me she saw the same thing but she was a bit closer
and
 saw it from a different angle.  To her it looked like a little person or
 child.  After the tour we went back and told the owner of the house what we
 saw and where it was going.  He informed us that he has never seen that
ghost,
 but many guest to his house described the same sighting.  The only difference
 was the other people saw it coming out of a door and going up stairs, we saw
 it going down stair into the door.  Now I am 100% certain that their is
 something after death.  Just because you can't touch it or weigh it or put it
 through scientific study doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Try to touch an ego,
 or happiness, or sorrow, you can't prove they exist either. Any way I was
 straight as a board when I saw this so was my girlfriend.  {:-o Mark

Keeping with your general idea, there's something I wanted to mention
before Magick.  A lot of you have asked if there's anything I need as far
as helping out for Halloween.  There's one BIG thing you guys could all be
a part of.  If anyone is offered K or H at Magick or knows that someone is
selling that shit at my party, please come to Rich or I IMMEDIATELY.  We
have great security lined up but unfortunately it's you guys that are out
there with access to these creeps, not the security.  The security is
there for you.  They're being paid with your money.  They will listen.
And I certainly will.  This stuff has been present at far too many parties
recently and talk about vibe killer.  Besides, we're dying to go through
with our plan of taking the culprit and standing him in full view of
everyone with a sign around his/her neck that reads: "This person was
trying to ruin your party"   Kind of like the Scarlet Letter.

But seriously, this is very important to me.  I know that I can't control
what people choose to do to.  If they want to bring it for themselves and
ruin their own time, fine.  Although anyone who is noticeably under the
influence (slumped in the corner, randomly shoving dancers on the floor)
will be removed.  I see what has been going on in recent months as I've
been out promoting.  I'll be super busy the day of, so I need the eyes and
ears of all of you.  Spread the word.

Thanks
-Kelly

* on a lighter note, we're jumping out of our skins excited.  we're all
going to have so much fun!!!!!

I seriously think we have the resources or friends who have a bit more
resources then ourselves to set up a Pb-Cle party.  I mean if the list here is
totaly serious about setting it up, I will be more than happy to contribute
time, and money into it, as will many of us I am sure.  I also am saying that
WHEN we do this(hoping we will), it does not have to be right now, but as long
as we keep together we will have the resources to do this.  But, its all about
unity, so we have to unify or nothing we say will be accomplished.
HUmmm....well....I guess thats all I have to say right now I guess.  I am sure
I will respond more later.

Wait wait wait.  Trust me on this - the writer didn't fuck up.
Soul Coughing is definitely not a punk band.   The article explains them
decently well.  They aren't exactly drum + bass (a few new tunes
definitely are), but they are very drum + bass INFLUENCED.

They are somewhere between jazz, hiphop, alternarock and drum and bass.
Their singer is a beat poet.  
They have an upright bassplayer and all of them are into jazz.   
The have programmed and live beats and samples.  
All of them band is into drum + bass.  
Last tour they had DJ Krust (of Represent/full cycle/etc)
along with them.   The drum + bass producer Optical engineered two tunes
on their new album.

I like them alot and will be @ the show, even though @ $15 is a bit much
for just one band....but i hear they're even better live because they do
alot of improvization.

Ok, so I'm a nerd.  I like Law & Order.  I usually watch it on A&E but
tonight, I was bored so I'm watching a new one.  They're trying to track
down some drug dealers and then this rotten cop gets into the mix.  None
of that is really important.  The point is this:  The D.A. is interviewing
this underage kid in juvi who was caught "dealing".  He's telling her the
story of how he got into dealing.  He says, "We hooked up at a
RAVE"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Argh!!!!  It really is leaking into
mainstream culture.  OH my goodness!  Just thought I'd report on the
mainstream connection like a good pb-cle agent should.

i had to alter some things to fit my answers..

Favorite Ghetto House DJ/ Live Act: dj urban, except for last weekend.. what
was up with that? i was so pissed.. i stood there for 20 minutes asking
everyone that walked by me, "where the fuck is the pussy??". i think they were
afraid of me. :o)
dj funk is rad too.. he spun at the first party i went to and i was hooked.

Favorite Trance DJ/ Live Act:
mm... i dunno. ive heard some trance i liked at parties, but didnt know who
was spinning at the time. i dont usually sit around listening to trance cuz it
makes me sleepy. 

Favorite Jungle DJ/ Live Act:
dieselboy, 187, um.. do the jungle brothers count? man i suck. i never pay
attention to things like that at parties, or if i do, and i ask someone whos
on, no one around me knows. blah.

Favorite Froot:
heheh.. steve? just kiddin.. raspberries are my fav. are avacadoes (sp?)
considered fruit or vegetables? they have a seed afterall.. i like those too.

Favorite Techno DJ/ Live Act:
i cant give a good answer to this question. some djs i might consider techno
but theyre really something else and then ill look like a dork.. as if i dont
already. 

Favortie Party:
i had a blast at crystalized 2. and phreak show. and revibe. revibe was prolly
my favorite. 

Favorite List Member:
um.. i dont like to play favorites. ok im lying. i do. but im not naming
names. i would like to mention, however, that the three people i hang out with
the most and that are some of my best friends are on this list. and thats rad.

Favorite Record Label:
i dunno.. subpop? doghouse? .. most of my favorite labels arent techno related
labels. i like 611 records tho. they have neat stuff there. 

Favorite Quote:
*conversation hearts
i eat them without even
reading the words.*
ive got a ton of quotes.. "you men have no shame. if you're not thinking with
your weiner you're working directly on its behalf." - minnie driver in "good
will hunting"
"sending outwords of love was like, firing a coded message with a faulty
transmitter; always unsure of how it would be received."- from a book i read
once. "there is always the option of being emotionally lazy, that is, of
quoting." hooha!
"happieness is yelling BINGO!" - a bumper sticker i saw once on the way to
michigan.. "addiction to self-destructive fashion is no joke. just say no to
pleated pants."  alright. thats enough for now.

Favorite Month:
june.. the beginning of summer! and november.. fall is pretty and its my
birthday. 

Favorite Holiday:
i dont really like holidays all that much, but i like not having to work on
them. i like halloween the best, but its not as much fun now that im too old
to go trick or treating.

Favorite City:
new york city. metuchen, new jersey. san antonio, texas. id probably like san
francisco a lot too if i ever got out there.

Favorite Candy (any candy ravers out there??) :
ooh.. too many to name. laffy taffy, now and laters, safety pops, lifesaver
pops, lemon heads, orange heads, red shoestring licorice, peanut m&ms, i dunno
what else. i like candy too much. <pats belly> :o)

Favorite Drug:
hugs not drugs. altho every once in a while midol is my best friend. 

Favorite Roller Coaster:
hmm.. i like the mantis a lot, but i hate it when it jerks yer head around and
you bang it into the side thingies. the raptor is fun too. 

Favorite Color:
green! lime green, greenblue, grass green.. i like green the best. i like blue
sometimes too.. sky blue, navy blue, blue is good. sometimes i like black..
sometimes red. i like rainbows. and sparkly things. i like pink sometimes too
like when its on something cute like my hello kitty wallet. 

Favorite TV Show:
my so-called life. i am so much like angela at times its sick. daria is rad
too. if im not like angela, im like daria. what a combo, eh? also, i like the
real world a lot too. i want to be on that show. i could have all my silly
friends come visit me too and we'd drive everyone nuts.

Favorite Accessory:
shoes. you can never have too many shoes. i never wear half of the ones i
have, but im always on the hunt for more. same with sunglasses. and
backpacks/shoulder bags. i like pretty underwear too. but no one really gets
to see those.. except for a priveledged few. 

Favorite Band:
i have tons. but presently, tiger trap and modest mouse and weston seem to be
getting me thru my days.

i cant think of any more questions. so thats it for now.
*erin*

Anybody heard about this one yet?  It's going to be in a barn about 30
miles west of Cleveland.  I know a few of you went to Phat Free at this
place a while back.  This one will be a ~free~ party too.  At Phat Free
there were about 300 kids maybe...and it was pretty full inside & out.  The
guy throwing it said he's not sending out invites for this one, but when
the place is full, no one else will be able to come in.

Phat Free was pretty tight.  Nice people, nice music.  I know I'm looking
forward to this!  Anyone have more info?

all i have to say is that organizations, if they are to have strong 
beliefs, remove individuality. that is why i have a major problem being 
part of any political group. i even quit caring about food not bombs 
pittsburgh after i saw how blindly people follow the "rules" set forth 
by a group. i like just bein a bunch of dorks.

HEY EVERYONE!

It's John from House of Styles in Pittsburgh. Sorry there's been some
confusion about my next event DAWN  ON FRIDAY NOV. 13Th. IT IS GOING TO BE
HELD IN PITTSBURGH. It was originally planned to be here but was changed to
Cleveland because I was planning on combining with the Fame Records event
that they were starting to plan on the same day so there would be no
conflict. However, things seemed even more complicated after we decided to
combine and time was running out so I decided to continue doing my own thing
and continue to have DAWN in Pittsburgh. For the record, as well, I would
like to say that this whole chain of events has occurred in a very peaceful
manner and there are no hard feelings felt on either my side or the Fame
side. We both are supporting each others events and offered any assistance
to each other. I have much respect for the people behind Fame and for all
their hard work and look forward to any dealings with them. I hope all goes
well for both of us. If anyone has any questions for me call the House of
Styles infoline @
412.734.8427.

For those that are interested here's the info for Dawn.

please excuse my ignorance or commend my observations, but has anyone
notice that the names of streets and such around pittsburgh are changing?
i.e. forbes ave. is now "fortune 500 avenue" and 6th and 7th streets
downtown have changed to peoples names i have never heard of.  im sorry,
but i havent heard mention of this anywhere and its sparking a whole host
of paranoia.. anyone have any sort of enlightenment?

steve.

my own questions:

?Who I'd most like to hear at a party:

Andrei Morant from Texas

?Favorite bands before I heard techno:

Sonic Youth, Pixies (I heard a rumor she was into field hockey players, it
was so hush hush)

?The best thing about e:

Those ominous, rumbling, awe-filled minutes when the music gets into that
certain fold in your brain and you realize that something that will change
everyone and everything from this point on is HAPPENING RIGHT NOW and (in a
way that's just outside of your understanding's grasp) by putting your
entire essence into dancing to that music you realize that you're a tiny
::but vital:: part of what is causing it.

?Worst DJ name:

DJ Mittens

?Next giant step forward in technology:

Computers based on quantum spectrum lines instead of binary on/off switches

?Favorite Flyer:

That Buzz flyer when they first opened back up.  It had bees flying around
that were made of computer chips and hives made of those tall black
transisters.

?Actors that I can't take seriously because everytime I see them on-screen
it's like there's this constant subliminal Duhhhh:

Bill Pulman, Patrick Swayze

?Coolest book set in the future:

Holy Fire by Bruce Sterling  >>READ IT  **definately**

?Famous people I've met:

I can only think of 3 right now:  Grace Slick (not an exciting story at
all), Steven King (I used to deliver him pizza often), and Lady Miss Kier
(when she was less DJ, more diva...she looked just like a normal, cutie
raver girl...she kissed my buddy Bob when he gave her a lollypop)

?Upcoming party I'm most excited about:

Continuum -- and Phryl's doing that boat party in Miami next spring with 7
(count em 7!) Swedish DJs

?Best movie I saw yesterday:

Pecker

?DJ that you were least shocked to hear was gay:

Robert de la Gaultier (it was the hair)

synthvortx@aol.com doesnt like the way i run the rom and says hyperreal is
a joke and is concerned about the state of the rom with the beastie boys
and front 242 listed on it.  comments to trout@hyperreal.org

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events, just testing this out and we'll see what the
reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

Fri Oct 16                    MODULATIONS MOVIE                   Cleveland

         MODULATIONS

         DIRECTED BY IARA LEE | PRODUCED BY GEORGE GUND

         October 16, 1998
         
         Cedar Lee, Cleveland OH - 2163 Lee Road - 216 321 8232
         
         -----

         We are not entertainers, we are sound scientists -
         Kraftwerk


         From the makers of Synthetic Pleasures, comes the film
         Modulations, a feature-length documentary which captures
         a moment in history where humans and machines are fusing
         to create today's most exciting sounds.

         Modulations traces the evolution of electronic music as
         one of the most profound artistic developments of the
         20th century. By cutting back and forth between avant
         garde composers, Kraftwerk's innovative synthesizer
         drones, Giorgio Moroder's glacial Euro-disco, Afrika
         Bambaataa's electro-funk and Prodigy's current worldwide
         superstarstardom, Modulations celebrates, replicates and
         illuminates the nomadic drift of the post-human techno
         sound.

         The film examines the kids who have turned the turntable
         into a musical instrument, disillusioned disco lovers who
         created acid house out of primitive synthesizers, Motor
         City mavericks who saw the drum machine as their escape
         route out of urban neglect, and a generation of British
         youth who transformed these blips and bleeps into
         dancefloor anthems of their own alienation.

         Modulations provides a sense of history and context in
         which today's electronic music can be understood. It entertains
         the converted and remixes the mindset of electronica's
         nay-sayers.

         Featuring a stunning collage of interviews, cutting-edge
         visuals, in-studio footage and live performances,
         Modulations moves at a pace that matches the energy and
         innovation of the music.

Sat Oct 31                          GROW                          Cleveland

Price is $0 if you bring Halloween candy.

Price is $0 if you wear a costume.

Price is $0 anyway.

OK, the party's in Avon Lake west of Cleveland.  It's about 30 or so east
from downtown in a barn in the middle of a big field.  The barn has nice
concrete floors, 5 wacky shaped rooms (last party kids said it was like a
giant playland) There's room for tents.  It'll be cold, but if you want
to,
there's a place to set up camp.

Here are the directions from Cleveland...
Take I-90 West to Exit 151 (the Sheffield/Avon exit) and take a right.  Go
2 lights and turn right on Abbe Rd.  Go over the bridge, and its the only
house after it on the left.  It's directly across from the Ford plant. 
You'll see 3 barns there with cars parked all around.  Someone out front
will yell at you to park over there where the rest of the cars are.

Pretty easy, huh?

DJs will remain unannounced, but the music will be good (some hard-ass
techno, some jungle, some speed garage, some live stuff).  It will start
around 10-11.  It is very important to ARRIVE EARLY!  This place will hold
maybe 200-300 dancing kids.  The guy throwing this said that after it's
full, no one else will be able to come in.

No phone number yet either, but I guess all the info you need is here
anyway.  The last party here was Phat Free a couple of months ago...a very
good time.  This one should end up even better!

Sat Nov 28                        ENERGIZE                               DC

U L T R A W O R L D 
in association with
CIRCLE, SONIC SOUL, and 2-TUFF

On Saturday November 28, 1998, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend,
Ultraworld will present the most spectacular event in its 6 year history.
It is called ENERGIZE, and that is exactly what we intend for it to do to
the dance music scene on the East Coast and beyond.  It will be held in
the massive DC Armory, and while we have done 4 events in this space
before, none will compare to the excellence of Energize.

The main arena of this space has a legal capacity of 12,000 in one
wide-open, high-ceilinged, wooden-floored expanse, but what will set
Energize apart from our previous events is that we have now been approved
to use the basement! Don't think basement like dark and dingy though,
this basement has ceilings of 40', and makes the biggest dance clubs on
the East Coast look like efficiency apartments in Manhattan.  Plus it's
divided up into rooms of various sizes. 
For the first time at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all
with full on concert level production in both sound and lighting.  

All performers listed below are confirmed.  The four rooms of Energize
will
be:

The Main Arena:   We will fill this space with the best sound system we
have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of lasers,
projection screens and intelligent lights.  The lineup is one of the best
we have ever presented, a true blend of the most prevalent styles of
electronic dance music.  From hard techno, to trance, to funky breaks, to
fun party music, the main room at Energize is going to be all that and
more.  The performers are:

CARL CRAIG performing live as
Paperclip People  Planet E Records, Detroit
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI  Matsuri Productions  London/Tokyo
DOC MARTIN  Los Angeles
ICEY  Zone, Orlando
SCOTT HENRY  Buzz, DC
T1000  Generator/DJax, Detroit
NIGEL RICHARDS  611 Records, Philadelphia

You may have seen that Uberzone was previously listed in the main room.
They
had said they were available, but then decided to cancel all bookings for
the
rest of the year to make time to write new music. 

The Drum 'n' Bass Arena:  In one of the basement areas, we are proud to
present some of the best U.S. drum 'n' bass talent, along with the
undisputed
champions of the U.K. scene.  This area will be hosted by 2 Tuff
productions
of DC.  The lineup is:

GROOVERIDER  Sony, Prototype, U.K.
FABIO  U.K.
MC GQ  the U.K.'s premier MC
DARA  Breakbeat Science, NYC
DIESELBOY  Platinum, Philadelphia
AK1200  Orlando
DB  Breakbeat Science, NYC
SLANT  2 Tuff, DC
ENTITY  Ultraworld
FLUID  Sonic Soul, Baltimore
MC DUB2  Philadelphia

The Deep House Arena:  This third area, also in the basement, is bigger
then any dance club on the East Coast.  It will be hosted by
Philadelphia's Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long.  The performers are:

DERRICK CARTER  Chicago
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION  Universal Language, U.K.
FEELGOOD  Charm City Records, Baltimore
KENNY GLASGOW  Toronto
O'KEEFE  Circle, Philly
ROB PAINE  Circle, Philly
SEAN THOMAS  Circle, Philly

The Chill Out Arena:  The smallest area of the event, but still bigger
then the main room at most clubs!  This room will be hosted by Baltimore's
respected Sonic Soul crew, and will feature the downtempo side of
electronic music.  You can dance if you want to, with performers:

TIM "LOVE" LEE  Tummy Touch, U.K.
PETE LAWRENCE  the Big Chill, U.K.
WE performing live  Asphodel, NYC
LOVEGROVE  Sonic Soul
DJ C  Toneburst, Boston
RHOMBUS  Sonic Soul

What makes this event even more exciting, is the fact that it will be a
collaborative effort between Ultraworld, Circle, 2Tuff, and Sonic Soul.
While Ultraworld will be the main organizers and provide the direction for
the event, these other three crews will be involved to specifically manage
the areas of music they are most interested in.  What that means for you
is that you get the highest quality of production and care going into
every aspect of the event.

Tickets will be on sale in the DC/Baltimore area on September 30, and
should be at all of the outlets by October 3, and will be broken down as
follows:

There will be 1000 tickets sold for only $20!   So if you know you're
going to go, you have the opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low
price.  We are accepting orders for these tickets now, or you can wait
until they are at the outlets. If you'd like to mail order your ticket,
send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER ONLY, made out to Ultraworld Productions for $20
per ticket ordered.  Send it to:

Ultraworld Productions
3042 O'Donnell St
Baltimore, MD  21224

After those 1000 are gone the price will be $25 up to and including
October 31.  

On November 1st, the admission price goes to $30, and will stay at that
price even the day of the show, at the ticket outlets.  Admission at the
gate will be $35.

Also, we are working with the Buzz crew to make this an extended weekend.
For those of you who may not know, Buzz is DC's premier club event, held
every Friday by DJ's Scott Henry and Lieven De Geyndt.  It plays host to
the world's top DJ's and live acts, and the DC scene in general is one of
the best in the country.  When you purchase your ticket to Energize, there
will be a stub which will allow you to come to Buzz on Friday night for
only $5  (Note: Tickets purchased through Ticketmaster will not have this
stub, but Buzz will honor the $5 admission).   Consider coming to DC on
Friday, and making a long stay of it.  We'll post hotel and travel info on
this site in the weeks to come. 

To stay in DC, try these hotels:
Phoenix Park Hotel (closest to venue)	202.638.6900
Best Western (closest to Buzz & afterparty)	202.488.7500
Holiday Inn				202.383.3838
Wyndham Bristol				202.995.6400

Rates are around $90 per night.


When you've had your turkey and you're done with the family, 
the place to be is Washington, D.C. for Ultraworld's ENERGIZE!!!

I have been so inspired to spin lately, which I have wanted to do for a while

hahaha...

next thing you know, yer gonna have a whack-ass jenny jones called
"rave-makeover" with 6 kids and their 6 mom's bitchin like a
muthafucka about "i hate the way she dresses, her pants are SO big,
and i hate her piercings!", and the whack-ass kid'll be like "mom,
this is the way i wanna look... yaddayaddayadda"... then when the
conversation get's old, it'll be time for the makeovers, the mom's
dressing their kids up all preppy/nice, and the kids dressing their
mom's up all raver style, dyin their hair all sorts of different
colors with 69" kickwears + stuf. hehehee... i saw a show exactly like
that for goths + punks + their mom's. that's why i NEVER watch tv
(unless i'm skeed + watching animal planet :).

hey there, hugh...

yeah i was RIGHT IN YOUR SHOES about a year and a half ago, i guess...
since then i have spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on djing +
stuff, and let me tell you - IT WAS SO DAMN WORTH IT!

this was written quick + sloppily, but it is fairly complete... i make
suggestions as to what sort of shit to buy, cause i have done way too
much looking into the matter, cause i've recently helped 2 of my
friends get started djing, as well as going thru the whole ordeal
myself.

so, basically what everyone is going to tell you, is that if you wanna
be a dj that spins @ raves, you've gotta get yourself a pair for
technics 1200's. the thing is, they cost $450 EACH! (if you are
interested sometime soon, i might be able to hook you up for $390 each
brand spankin new, this is way below the regualr price... if you want
more info, just ask). the reason you need 1200's is cause that's what
you are gonna be spinnin on when you are spinnin out, and they are the
standard for djs, etc. 

next you are gonna need a mixer. you should just get a starter one...
i reccommend the $130 vestax from PSSL (pro sound and stage lighting:
http://www.pssl.com).. not too expensive, but also a high quality
component that sounds great and wont break.... you can save a bit of
money and get a battle board II or something like it, but they suck,
and you will need to replace it soon after you get it. get a PSSL
catalog, they are good to browse thru....

next you need cartridges. everyone gets the 500AL's the start out
with. they are like $50 per pair. (available thru PSSL)

next you need headphones... we got a really nice pair from radio shack
with a volume slider built into the cord... they cost about $30 and
perform VERY WELL... i highly suggest them. they can take whatever
volume you throw @ em and wont distort.

next you need slipmats, $15 per pair, available @ your local tekno shop.

next you need records (i suggest jungle :)

then you need to hook all that shit up to a stereo and practice for
hours and hours and hours.

everything else should fall into place.

peace + good luck.

think that Ghandi or Martin Luther King could be considered "elitest"  What i
do consider elitest is when a promoter advertises an all star line up but
fails to deliver,  or when they let someone sell 8oz of water for $3.50.
Sometimes people take advantage of our peaceful nature, and see it as a sign
of weekness.  We have the Peace and the Love, but if we don't Unify we will
get no Respect.  We have about 200 PB-CLE members right now,  i hope we can
double or triple that number by the end of the year...and that would be just
the start.  There might be some small glitches at first but with  all the good
people we have so far i'm sure it will all work out.  So far as rules go, I
don't believe we should do anything that would exclude any of us. This is not
going to be like the Elks or the Masons.  Just like now everyone should have
an equil say in the issues that concern us.  For all the good we could
accomplish, i don't see really any reason why we shouldn't press forward.  A
lot of great ideas have allready been proposed, we are only going to be
limited by your imagination.  so lets put the Unity back in P.L.U.R. By the
way if your not up for this then you don't have to get involved in the
activities.  I belive in diversity of opinion, and am not going to try to
change anyones mind. Well it is time for me to get off the soap-box.  A PB-CLE
rave,hmmm... lets get the ball rolling.  peace...{;-] mark

I'm all for it if there's really alot of people interested.
A few more things to consider:

Where to have it so everyone can come?
When to have it?
What kind of music?  
Should pb-cle-dj's play only, or no pb-cle djs, or a mix?
What venue? - this is always the biggest Question in pgh i think
For charity or something?
Some kind of idea or theme to it?

I'm sure other people have their own perspectives on promoting, but 
from doing LIBAD, i learned that it takes a small core of people to get
most of the things done, and then having alot of people around the day of
helps alot.  Organization is very helpful.  Alot of promotion is also
helpful.  I'm sure we'd crush in that department.

Consider: there's what, 200 people on this list?
Probably at least 50 people who'd directly like to be involved.
For funds, perhaps a collective effort would work best.
If 50 People put in $100 a piece, that would be $5000, a pretty reasonable
price to do an event for.  Lots of other configurations would work too. 
I'm sure we could get sound and djs for cheap or free if we wanted to do
it as a charity thing.  

Ideally i think it would be cool to do a 2-room event.
One room of djs we bring in, and another of pb-cle djs, 
or something along those lines.

For djs, we could get some former list members, like 187,
farmer tea, grrl 13, maybe the former listadmin bit (others?).

And it would be also good to represent all different styles of music
because obviously we're not a one-genre list.

Vote on who we'd like to see i suppose would be the best way to do it -
or get a few concensus acts that everyone would be into.

Or we could do only pb-cle-raves djs...if we could get a balance of djs it
might be cool to do a cleveland and a pittsburgh room, although what's the
point of dividing us up?  Also, i think we have an excess of jungle djs.

There's obviously alot more issues to deal with, the biggest of which is 
if there's actually a solid core of people into making such a rave happen.
Just throwing out some ideas.

- Geoff

woo hoo!...the president of the new company i'm working 
for: Noritech is in today's business section of the columbus
dispatch!...i'm really proud of her not only because she is
a female, but she is also a minority...kinda gives us other
minorities hope in this country...i know this is not rave
related...but i just wanted to post something positive!

...lookin forward to the ohio promotors meeting tonight,
again just a reminder: this meeting was not my idea, but 
this meeting was concieved to bring hope of unity back into
the scene...and coming together physically seemed like a 
logical first step...(after all this was how family affair
one was originally concieved...one small step for man...one 
giant step for mankind...

actually, jenny jones, even with all the stupid makeover crap, is probably
the only talk show that has portrayed ravers in a positive way.. at least
in the past shows i've seen.  she had a whole bunch of kids on the show
one day and the answered all the typical ignorant questions from the
audience and jenny went off on this speech about how they are just
misunderstood and were the greatest bunch of kids shes ever had on the
show.. either that or someone payed her, heh.

well about 2 yrs ago, donahue had nyc club kids on the show, i didnt catch
all of it coz i was at werk, but all they seemed to be about was the kooky
ass outfits, and they were outrageous looking and getting into clubs for free.
and how they'd sneak about coz some were like 12-13....
i dont remember much else and i didnt watch it for long, i would LOVE a
videotape of the show, i wonder if you can order them, i know some shows do
have tapes available.

I don't think that we should flyer for this party. I believe that the aim
should be to throw a party for ourselves and to invite our friends via
word of mouth or through something like a cyber-flyer.  I don't think that
we should try and "market" it they way that flyers today do. And if we did
decide to flyer, I'd love to see a tiny flyer ele_mental style or like the
SCJ flyers.. Those rock.

If we decide to celebrate the talent that we have on this list alone, I am
certain that we could have a ton of djs for free.

I say that we stick to the pb-cle-only lineup. I don't think that we
should be shelling out money for djs when I am sure we have a really great
talent pool on this list alone. I would hate for a pb-cle room to be
overshadowed by another room. I think that this party should be an
opportunity to showcase the enormous resource of this list. Besides, I am
all for this one-room-one-vibe concept, although it might be really
wicked to have a down-tempo/chill/ambient room that would not be competing
with the main room.

I think that we should definately flyer for the party, although along small
lines like you mentioned.  If we don't flyer, it all goes back to the whole
elitism issue...ick.

Whats up, lately I have recieved a ton a questions about the pre-sale tickets for Barely Legal on Fri. Oct.16. Here is a general answer for everyone. Tickets are $10 at these locations:

 Zero I-Q Records (Cleveland)  216.297.1080
 Fame Records (Akron)   330.434.1354                 
 Hypervinyl (Pittsburgh)  412.681.4164 

Tickets will be available until Friday afternoon, If you do not have a ticket, adimission at the door will be $10 before midnight and $15 after midnight. If for some reason anyone can't get to a ticket outlet, e-mail me privatly to reserve on at the door for $10, or leave a message on the vicious circle infoline at #216.556.5519. For anyone who missed the updates, DJ Urban will tag team with Kevin Cuningham, to do a booty house, drum and bass set. Tik Tak replaced freekboy to do a jazzstep jungle set, and we also added Wilhelm K to the lineup to do the morning set. That should answer all of your questions. e-mail me if you need more info. 
Hope to see you all on Friday. PEACE

Hey...does anyone know of anything going on this SATURDAY? Other than Full
House in Columbus that is... Preferably something here in Cleveland or Akron.
Boy, when I complained about a year ago that parties should go back to Friday
nights so I could have more time to recover before Monday, I didnt know that
EVERYONE would go to that...hahahah... Casey

for anyone who doesn't know, they are filming the movie "inspectoer gadget"
downtown. it has been going on for a while now and i am guessing that is the
reason for all the name changes. i could be wrong, but all the roads you have
mentioned seem to fit within the areas that i know of that they are filming
in. if that made any sense...

      I would have to dissagree....Tracy I Love You, with Tracy Lords has to
be the ultimate porno...just because it is Tracy Lords!!!!!  You cant beat
cheap, overdubbed french XXX porn.  I also think she made that porno when she
was 19 or 20 too...I dont remember.....Did you know Tracy Lords was in Blade,
and in Melrose Place?  Anyways...enough pointless info.

I'm pretty excited at the moment because I just bought a pair of
tickets to see Underworld in Chicago on Nov. 21. I've only been
waiting 2 1/2 years for them to tour, and I swore that if they did
go on tour anywhere in this country east of the Mississippi I was
going. Now, I just have to deal with the waiting...

Is there still a netmeet for Impact?  I will be there! :)  I am going by
myself and don't expect to know a lot of people there, so I would love to
meet anyone going...I have to leave for work around 11:30 a.m. tomorrow and
am going to Erie right from work, so could someone please e-mail me back
before then?  Also, does anybody have directions (coming from 90 west)?
                                          Love,
                                             Dan

Hi everyone,
         I've got a question for all you "music producers" :-)   I'm looking
into getting a Yamaha EX5R ..basically it's a synth/sequencer/sampler.   I was
just curious if anyone had any experience with it or if they could give me a
good price for one......

It has a nice "layering" system in it.......a well needed nesessity (sp) for
making really deep ambient:)  

Thanks
Jason

i heard a few kids say illusions was like being at laga, and now that i think
about it, it totally was, just because of the floor plan and demographics.
also i snooped around doreen's notebook and except for one kid from state
college and the girl i went with, the melling list didn't have anyone outside
of the 412 area.  so ... yeah.  i don't know where that was going but yeah :)

and sorry everyone for being a party-pooper towards the end.  i so had a bad
attitude that night.

the lobby of pitt's cathedral of learning has all this special lighting now,
and it looks extra gothic and beautiful and scary and romantic.

i've heard a few stories about this today.  one is what dori said - that there
is this movie _inspect her gadget_being filmed.  but i haven't seen any
trailers or crews or cameras.  a lot of kids are saying that there really is a
fortune500forum and those signs are not props but bill gates, donald trump,
the president of ghana, and adolf hitler really are going to be at this way
important conference of gluttonous businessmen and the cathedral of learning
is going to be the new headquarters for the evil leaders of global domination.

so do yall know about the national midget hopscotch contest? <g>

What a coincidence.....
We are having a halloween party at Trilogy based on this movie.
We are flying in most of the people that are featured in the film.
For now....
here is SOME  of the info..
PARTY MONSTER...a blood feast
Friday, Oct. 30th   TRILOGY CLEVELAND
performing live.....
SCREAMIN' RACHEL  trax records, chicago
hosting the Hot Body contest...
LARRY TEE  original host of Disco 2000 nyc
In the V.I.P. room....
Ernie Glam and James St. James     original "club kids"
The party will celebrate and recreate the spirit of the original "club kid"
scene.
As it is Halloween, we will also celebrate the "gore" of this heinous crime.
We will be showing the movie throughout the night so people who haven't seen
it, can.    A lot more information about this party is forthcoming.
This is just a pre-flyer :-)

make it up, let me know!!!!!!

Directions from 90 west are-

79 North to 26th street (route 20) exit
At the exit turn right (26th street east)
Stay on 26th street about 20 blocks or so to STATE STREET
Turn left to 12th street
Address is 1201 State Street at Fusion Records.  

There is a parking across the street. It would be on your left right before
you get to 12th Street.

Net meet:
Lorianne <carousel00@aol.com>
Eric <junglealien@aol.com>
Brooke<sumner001@gannon.edu>
Braden <balbert@apk.net>
Linzee (and friend April) <cryolakid@aol.com> 
Dan<pihlblad@madbbs.com> 

Net kids can meet at 11:00 PM at the front counter of the record store.  Dan,
just ask for me when you get there....someone will point me out to you.  I'll
introduce you to the Erie party kids:-)  It should be a great party.  Great
DJs from Pittsburgh and Erie.  You will be impressed.  

See you tonight!!

O.K. now that many of you think that a party would be a good idea, we should
start to plan now.
1st we will need something like a treasurer to collect monies and handle
disbursements.  I would like to suggest Andy the Pooh for his detecation to
the rave scene, and i think all you kids trust him. i hope he is up for the
job.
                                                                              
2nd we will need somebody that would be in the position of "promoter" that
would coordinate the rave...such as lining up D.J.s checking on the space, and
handling the distribution of flyers.  I believe that Kelly and Rich from
downlow would be perfect, due to their experience and contacts.               
                                                                              
3rd the music we have Wizard Workshop on our list and we all know the phat
sound that comes out of his speakers..I hope that don would do the job for
free or at a reduced cost.                                                    
                                                                              
4th the printing I can do the printing of the flyers at cost.                 

5th FUNDS: it has been suggested by others that we collect like $20 or so from
everyone (voluntarily) on the list. That would give us $4000 right now, but i
hope through all your help we can expand the list...We also can try selling
water, or setting up a table at raves and giving out candy but have a donation
box there, also while at the table we could get the word out about PB-CLE
Raves.                              

6th the date. I would suggest some time in February. since this would be our
first party it would give us ample time to plan. Also people are usually
burned out around Xmas and new years.                                         
                                                                              
7th the SPACE... now this is just my opinion but i think we could have it at
the Irish center...we could probably get the space for around $1000 it is
clean, heated, most know where it is and is somewhat centrally located between
Cleveland, Columbus, Erie.                                                    

Now this was just my 2 cents worth of opinions, to make this work we need the
imput from everyone. I think this would be a wonderful way to unite all of
us... and there will be plenty to do for everyone. Hope to hear from you kids
soon {;-]+< peace mark

ya forgot to include the fact that some of us on the list are also

YES!  I've played around with it so much because I wanted it sooo BAD.
Well, the keyboard version, not the rack mount.  It's outstanding.  It
costs between $1900 and $2000 for the keyboard version at pianos 'n
stuff.  I would imagine the rack version is $2-300 cheaper. 
Unfortunately, that was just a little more than I could spare when I was
looking for a new keyboard but it is definitely worth it.  There is a
good review of it in May 98 Issue 69 of Future Music.  They rate all of
the equipment they review on a 0% to 100% scale.  The EX5 got a 95%, the
highest rating I've ever seen anything get.

You should but it.  My enthusiastic $0.02

Actually, soul coughing has been experimenting with d 'n b beats and 
traks for a while. I remember hearing remixes of some of their songs 
about a year and a half ago over at my non-raver friends houses, and 
saying," hell yea, i can't believe you're listening to jungle!" then 
getting the," jungle?? this is sould coughing..." reply.  I don't know 
about them being the most important group to utilize d 'n b(circuit 6 in 
tha house!!), but they do make an interesting mesh between their usual 
style and d 'n b. btw, did you guyz know soul coughing is from athens, 
Oh? just a little trivia for yinzz.. ttly! :)

The funniest porno I ever saw was called 'Super Hornio Brothers', and
it had Ron Jeremy as Mario. I can't think of any good lines off the

stuff.

Actually, the Traci Lords cd isn't bad. If you could just get her
to stop singing over top of the good Juno Reactor music...

I just have to say that this party sounds like a great idea.  Like I said
before I am definately here to help out with anything that I can.  I hope
everybody else here aggrees that this would be a great way to unify.  From the
way it looks we dont really have to worry about anything, excpet the
organization.  also its not like its TONS of money....just as long as
everybody participates.   Well...I am in a hurry.  Off to dandy, fun, yippy
skippy work, so peace.

ok, the key to a successful party is good organization. this does not
happen if the group of planners is too large. if you are going to pull
off a list party, you pretty much need to decide what 3-5 people are
going to be the main promoters and then keep track of everyone who just
wants to help out a bit (like flyer, work door on the night etc.)
this will save you many headaches =)

What's up? Just to let people know again, because I've had a lot of
questions regarding the party tonight...We will be allowing people in
without a ticket, $10 b4 midnight, $15 after. Alsoi remeber K.C. and
Urban are doing the tag team at 1:30am, and Wilhelm is playing at 6:00am.
Also Tic Tac is spinning at 9:00pm. We have sold a lot of tickets, but
the venue is pretty big, so we decided to let more people in.
peace.

let me tell you about pittsburgh weirdness. kevin + i were in my car
in downtown pittsburgh on the way back from hullabaloo, and we were
waiting at this traffic light that was red for like 5 minutes, and we
couldn't see what was going on in the intersection because there was a
truck in front of us. but there was a cop car on the other street and
i guess the cop was in the intersection. then a bunch of cars drove
backwards thru the intersection + onto this bridge 1 at a time and
they were going probably 40. i've never seen people drive backward so
fast. we both saw it + were both sober + not hallucinating from a lack
of sleep. then i think the cop reset the light and we drove thru and i
looked down both ends of that street and didn't see anything strange
just a few cars on each side. i have no idea why this would have
happened. anyway i think a all my feelings about hullabaloo have
already been said except that what was up with that girl on the stage
(in the main room) with the mic who was pretending to sing? that was
completely retarded. also, this is my new probably temporary address,
so use it if you're going to write back please.

and introduce ourselves.  How about in front of the stage at 1:00pm?  If there
is a problem, or a better location, please write back.  Hope to meet some of

yeah, the more i think about it, i think it is for the movie. they actually
are, or have been, filming on the sixth street bridge for the past few weeks
at $10,000 a day. and they also changed the letters on the PPG building to be
the letters of Mr. Claw's industry...

After talking with some of you privately about the possibility of a PB-CLE
party, some problems were pointed out such as "If i donate money toward the
party i should get in for free" I don't know but i feel if it is a donation
then it means just that, no strings attached.  If you can't donate or don't
want to then just pay at the door like everyone else.  How do you distinguish
someone that might have donated $40 or someone that put in 80+ hours of work
to make the rave happen.  The same could be said if someone donates money but
says I'm a D.J. so i should get to spin.  I'm sure that there are a lot of
good D.J.s on the list, but lets say there are 35 they can't all spin at a
party...then there would be no room for headliners, which will draw people
that are not on the list.  Then everyone likes a different type of music so
how could one party please everyone.  Please tell me that i am worrying about
nothing, i hope that everyone is big enough to accept some of the tough
decisions that will have to be made.  If  this is going to work we all have to
be basically in agreement, otherwise we might all be going off in 200 separate
directions.  This is an open discussion, if i am all wet please tell me so.
Hope to hear from you soon...peace (i hope) {;-[ mark

Not to step on anyone's toes that could also do this, but like I said, my
brother is really an expert/professional in the flyer category. I spoke with
him today, and he agreed to do it for very cheap, but he needs ADVANCE NOTICE
of everything that needs to go on it, and not be handed the shit three days
before it needs to be done. For those of you not familiar with Kevy-kev's
work, go to www.kg2-graphix.com  or just remember a few flyers he has done:

420  (One and Two)
Wicked Kingdom (Columbus)
Suicide 
Metamorphosis (Columbus)
Generator (Columbus)
Source
United We Stand (Chicago)
Connect (Detroit)
Brainwash (Cleveland)
Red Tempest (Cleveland)

Let me know, so I can let him know!!!!  -Casey-

Personally, I believe that a pb-cle party can be about promoting the
resources that we have on this list. That is why I advocate that we limit
the djs to listmembers (not only for cost-effectiveness, but I think it
would be really cool to see/hear the abundance of talent that we have on
this list), that we have one room in order to promote unity and
intermingling of regions, and that we limit our advertising to word of
mouth (as in, invite your friends) and cyber-related forms (e-flyers, a
website, etc). 

As for cost/donations, I think that if we have enough money up front from
whoever would like to donate (key word being, donate) as well as keeping
all costs at a total minimum, there is no reason why we could not have a
free party. I don't think that we should intend on throwing an all out
RAVE but rather a smallish "party." 

But then again, maybe I am being too
idealistic, and maybe my ideas about what a list party could be are not
shared by others on this list. I'm just keeping in mind something that the
ele_mental crew always tries to stress, that first-time events usually
fail because they try too hard to out-rave other events, and most
importantly that SIMPLE is BETTER. 

In any case, I am interested in what everyone else has to say...

and also Jeff/Stuff's supposedly going to be playing some tech-house
or minimalist techno right afterword at 10:30. I'm all about going to bed
early tonight :)

After talking with some of you privately about the possibility of a PB-CLE
party, some problems were pointed out such as "If i donate money toward the
party i should get in for free" I don't know but i feel if it is a donation
then it means just that, no strings attached.  If you can't donate or don't
want to then just pay at the door like everyone else.  How do you distinguish
someone that might have donated $40 or someone that put in 80+ hours of work
to make the rave happen.  The same could be said if someone donates money but
says I'm a D.J. so i should get to spin.  I'm sure that there are a lot of
good D.J.s on the list, but lets say there are 35 they can't all spin at a
party...then there would be no room for headliners, which will draw people
that are not on the list.  Then everyone likes a different type of music so
how could one party please everyone.  Please tell me that i am worrying about

Well, just having spoken with Aaron Stephanic from this list, he called the
Cedar Lee Theatre and the guy there says that Modulations has been postponed
for an indefinite period of time. So I am not sure if that means that it is
just not playing tonight, or what. Just wanted to let people know who were
planning to attend... -Casey-

hi...i dont even live here anymore so you can tell me to shut the hell 
up if you want. ;)

historically (not that that means anything), list parties have been 
parties organized by members on a list for members on a list and all 
their friends. 

i personally think its best to get all together and see what can be done 
with our pooled resources.

it's a lot more memorable when everyone lends a hand -- basically, to be 
blunt, it shouldnt be like every other party where you go and book 2 
headliners and a bunch of locals and thats it. net parties are 
different, they are almost entirely self-sustained, they are all about 
working together and having fun when it's all said and done.

everything should be voluntary and cheap/free/at cost.

i dont want to get involved in this b/c i think its up to you all to 
choose which path you want to take, but i have been involved with/around 
net parties for many years and if you have any questions please feel 
free to ask.

so far, kate is on the right track in my opinion....you dont need a 
$4000 budget when everyone is pitching in...you dont need fancy schmancy 
colored (albeit dope) flyers for a party that should be promoted on the 
net and via word of mouth with a minimum of kinkos-copied handouts for 
flyers...

you need to find a space and if necessary pay for it.
you need to find sound and pay the sound company their costs for doing 
sound.
you need to have djs and live acts FROM THE LIST submit tapes and have a 
group of 3-4 ppl pick the best ones (this is almost the hardest thing, 
b/c everyone wants to spin)

you need someone to oversee the whole thing, someone good at organizing, 
preferably someone who has done this before (i think rich+kelly would be 
great if they are willing to do it)

dont expect any money from donations. a lot of kids are broke and you 
cant expect everyone on the list to give even $5 in advance. same as any 
other party, you figure out your expenses, estimate how many ppl will 
show up and divide expenses by projected attendance to arrive at a 
figure that should be charged at the door. hopefully this number can be 
kept under $10 (it almost certainly can), if not $5.

it's funny, cause the kids on se-raves are putting together a list party 
right now too...strange coincidence.

did i tell you atlanta rocks? it does. :)

reachin' out to the pb-cle massive, hold it down...

hossam

Sounds like we're talking about 2 different types of parties here.  The first is
one in which the pb-cle list would act as "promoter" for an event.  Lots of work,
lots of organization.  And honestly I don't see the benefit?  Where would the
money go if the party made any?  Who's debt would it be if it lost any?  The
second idea seems more reasonable and that is to do something like Andy's
barbecue, but on a bigger scale. Have everyone that's interested from the list do
what they do best (DJ, organize, technical, errands).   For this I would say that
costs would be split up between those wanting to be involved.  If those outside
the list would be "invited" (another decision), they could get in free or make a
donation to either pay back list members or go to a charity.
As far as an actual "event" for only list members and guests (this number could
reach 300-400, I assume) I'm thinking that finding a small space for a definite
number of people would be easier than your typical venue search (pulling my hair
out).  It would be a "private party" and we'd have control of who was there
bringing in what (potato salad, weenies)....blah blah blah.
Maybe we need another survey?

was originally concieved...one small step for man...one giant step for
mankind... >>

I have a few questions to raise about this.
Did anyone on this list, besides Ed Luna, attend this meeting last night in
Columbus? My brother did (Kevin Grimm, aka DJ Kevy Kev), and he called me
today to fill me in on what basically took place.

He kind of expected it to be a sort of swap meet of ideas, and a helpful
exchange of information. Instead, apparently, it was a debate contest; a
competition to see who was on who's side of the idea pendulum. 

I'll explain: This meeting was basically an open forum to discuss and plan
Family Affair 5, which I have learned in the past year, from Brian Wheeler's
efforts, is a FULL-TIME, YEAR-ROUND job to organize and plan. I won't even get
into this past year's fiasco, but those of us who were at the previous three
(especially the first two) can certainly identify with Brian's vision of what
Family Affair should be/should always be about. Brain Wheeler is a visionary.
Unfortunately, not all of his ideas work out as planned. He envisioned a grand
party, with BIG, HEADLINING DJ'S/LIVE ACTS, huge/loud sound systems, brilliant
lights, at an exciting and accomodating venue. Basically, it was to bring as
many people together at one place, and have just a big, blowout party. This
gets expensive, but it HAS worked, and people have a great time.

Well, then there is the other side of the spectrum: Someone else at this
promoters' meeting who wants to take over the planning of Family Affair, who
envisions Family Affair like this: a FREE party, with local dj's and acts that
(although not as nationally known) are still very talented, renegade sound
quality, in a renegade type setting (usually not legitimately secured). 

Now, this, in my opinion, comes down to your philosophy of what Family Affair
should be.  It all comes down to what you expect from this party. I know from
a personal standpoint, that I expect Family Affair to be a HUGE deal of a
party, with only the most WELL KNOWN and reputable dj's spinning, A HUGE
BLARING sound system, FANTASTIC LIGHTS, all at a place that i know I am safe
for the whole weekend. It has ALWAYS had that feel, and I have ALWAYS felt
like I got my money's and TIME'S worth by going to Family Affair (barring this
year, of course). I have a strange feeling that I may be opening up a can of
worms right now, but I want to, because NOW is the time to speak up for what
you want in this party. Brian and everyone else start the ACTIVE planning mode
of this operation in ONE MONTH. Some of you who have read this far, and dont
think this is a big deal, I apologize. 

Peace... -Casey-

so yes i have to agree with what kelly said.  what i've heard, especially from
mister rab (and most others?), is about some money-making venture where we
have to charge money at the door, but it seems like hossam and kelly and andy
and kate - and i for that matter - have been considering something really
simple

kinda like the pillow parties we had when we were younger.  one kid would have
everyone over, another kid would bring ice cream, another kid pizza, another
kid doritos, another kid soda (or pop ... another survey question) 

but we're talking two turntables and a microphone.  teak already said we can
use the lovelab soundsystem, we can use my lava lamp and stobe light for
wicked effects, and apparently several of you own mixers.

now what's the big dill about promotions and guest lists and flyers?  i thot
it would just be a get-together

the point im trying to make here is that trying to find one goal to

so the kids on the se-raves list came up with this idea...

put up a web page that would have real audio clips/samples/sets of all 
the djs that wanted to spin and have ppl vote for what they want on that 
page.

yeah, theres technical details like who has the ability to make real 
audio files from tapes or cd's (i dunno, i have no idea how its done), 
who has space on a server, etc. etc.

but overall i think its an excellent idea, and one of the fairest ways 
to decide who is going to spin...

so flesh out the details yourselves...it's just a suggestion.

feedback? 

peace,
hossam

that this is from is called MUSIC FOR BABIES.......good stuff check it
out.......If NEbody else has good suggestions on some good ambient listens let

mellow stuff like ambient and then I go from that and love extremely hard
raunchy hardcore shit....I like tha stuff in between too...but those are my
favs.

I know a former listmember who has server space and the technical skillz
to do this. It might take a little convincing, but I'm sure that won't be
too hard ;). 

First, however, we need to come to an agreement on what path this party
will go down...

As you know I wus bored today so I went out to spend some monees that I don't
even have.......( i get my paycheck in tha mail and fer some reason its two
days late now,  postman should be here soon though.  If he doesnt have it I am
gonna have to lay down a beat down)  N-Eway I live in Canton and thee only
good hookup fer music is Checkered records which is right down tha street from
me.
Guy that werks there is musically one ov thee most knowledgeable guys I know,
but with the new "electronic revolution" takin mad effect he feels a little
confused.  He busted out this box ov all new shit he got to see if I could
help him catagorize tha shyit.  Well while looking through them I came across
the Modulations soundtrack ( you know that movie I wus plannin on scopin
yesterday but it was postponed,blahblahblah)  Very good.  I wus sittin here
listenin to it a reading through tha liner notes while eatin McD's.  It's
kinda funny but informative too.  It has an "electronica timeline" which dates
back to 1913 ( luigi Russolo 'art of Noise'~use of industrial noises and
rhythms) to 1990's (trip-hop and jungle).  Next i turn tha page and it has a
"featured artists" section, where it performers featured in tha movie starting
with ALec Empire to X-ecutioners and lists a little note about their style
etc.  Next it has a long column on film treatment which I havent read through
yet.  After that it has "definitions" for everything to do with electronic
music (4/4 beat vx.  Breakbeat, Dub, Krautrock, Tb 303 Bassline and everything
in between.  then it has tha little movie credits section and ov course tha
little order form insert.
tha tracks and artists on it go like this
1<donna summer  I FEEL LOVE
2<afrika bambaataa  PLANET ROCK
3<juan atkins/model 500  NO UFO'S REMIX
4<lfo / Simon FROM SYDNEY
5<derrick may/  STRINGS OF LIFE
6<jesse saunders/ YEAH
7< aphrodite/  AMAZON 2-king of the beats
8<panacea/ STORMBRINGER
9<goldie a rob playford/  THE SHADOW
10<ryoji ikeda/  luxus 1-3
11<coldcut/ ATOMIC MOOG 2000
12<to rococo rot/  KRITISCHE MASSE 1

boy this is making me even more excited to see this film, i can't wait.  I
think everyone should go.  We should get a crew ov netkidz and their freinds
to all go on tha same night.
By tha way i also picked up ROB GEE/ heroes of hardcore
and tha INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH ANTHOLOGY1
its got DX-13, the Mover, Turbulence, Disintegrator, Glitch, Laura Grabb,
machines, and spy....those ov you who like hardcore/industrial......just in
case NEbody cares....if not just humor me.

I havent had much to say on this subject, but I say we keep it low
key.........list members and freinds ov list members which will still be quite
alot ov people.......and my personal opinion is we just have voulunteer
performers from tha list and people that people on tha list know........there
would be plenty ov people and plenty ov music.....I think there should also be
more than one room.....I don't know a bout you but I like it when there are
musical options......Oh by tha way does NE-body on tha list spin FUCKIN
HARDCORE.  If so my vote is for you to spin.......thats just my opinion on
this whole idea.

I agree w/ Kelly and Hossam's ideas of a small more intimate party. 
When i re-suggested, that's what I had in mind.  I'm not really
thinking big expenditures or anything.  Just a bunch of people, most
of whom are from the list getting together and havign a party for
themselves and their friends.  When you get into big expenses then it
just gets too confusing for this many ppl I think.

As far as DJs are concerned, I think the idea about real audio and
voting is very good.  That way we'll get a majority decision.

ok, later,

Just wondering if there's a trend trying to start where people expect venues to
be announced ahead of time (days, weeks, months before the party).  It seems
strange to me.  After all, in keeping with rave tradition, the spot is usually
kept secret until the day of.  I realize that clubs are used more often these
days and events are in the works long before part-time.  Just wondering what the
big deal was.  More and more people are leaving messages on the info. line asking
for directions to the space.  When I first started going to parties it was very
hard to find out what venue was being used beforehand.  Maybe it's the fear of
shady promoters not providing a good space.  Hmmmmmmm.

I like the idea of keeping a party simple and within the group.  I hope that
Kelly and/or Rich could help out after Magick....The idea of a demo tape is
wonderful..so all you d.j.s on the list do your best...sorry i am not as lucid
as i normally am but just got back from BARELY LEGAL....By the way was full of
happy uplifting music....and it has been a loooooong trip back to the burgh.
just you guys talking about working together to achieve a common goal make me
so happy. Have a wonderful day...peace &) mark

does anyone know what song is played in the one vw bug commercial? 
(_not_ the one with little fluffy clouds).  the commercial has a bug
flying around making a bunch of trippy patterns and the slogan "less
flower, more power."  the track is sort of mellow drum & bass, and I
think ends with a hammond organ riff.  It's been awhile since I've seen
it (I generally only watch cartoon network and they're not real big on
car commercials  for obvious reasons) so I don't recall much else, just
that it was a cool track.

thanx,
jesse

Prob one of the more well-known ambient artists is aphex twin.  he
really doesn't fit into that category (if I had to label his stuff I'd
just say "experimental")but that's what he's mostly associated with. 
His newer work tends to lean towards really off-the-wall "drill & bass"
('nother nifty media tag.)  anyway, he has two volumes of "selected
ambient works."  only vol 2 is available domestically.  it's amazingly
good, dark, minimalist, and largely beat-less.  vol 1 is really good
also, is lighter, poppier and full of beats.  even tho it's import only
I've seen it around for $15 or so.  afx is what got me into electronic
music in the first place, and I recommend anything he does.  Besides
Aphex Twin and AFX, he also has releases under Polygon Window and
Caustic Window.

space time continuum is quite cool too.  I'm not sure what his new stuff
is like, but I have his first album(sea biscuit) and it's really good. 
whenever I listen to it I imagine myself far beneath the surface of an
ocean.  really cool stuff, especially in the summertime, for some
reason.

then there's eno, of course, the guy who pretty much invented ambient
music.  I keep meaning to get "another green world" but never get around
to it.

i also have a paul d. miller (dj spooky) album called viral sonata
that's pretty cool, but technically that would be ill-bient now,
wouldn't it? *smirk*  I don't think it's meant to really paid attention
to at all, but can be extremely potent as ambient music in the strictest
sense of the word.  


mostly I can't stress how good aphex twin is.  if you don't have any of
his stuff, you _must_ get some.

hth,
jesse

I realize there is a big tradition of keeping spaces confidental until the
day of the show.  In some cases this is prbably a good idea as to make
sure that new venue owners don't get phone calls from the uptight citizens
brigade beforehand that may try to scare them out of holding an event.  I
dont even know if there really is such a movement but it may be of
concern.

It does make some practical sense and may help attendance if people did
know locations beforehand so adequate transportation could be arranged.

My personal suggestion would to still never print locations on flyers but
announce them on the info lines and/or da 'net.

My little thought of the day.

plur,

jbrick

I just got back a little while ago from work which I went to directly from
Impact in Erie last night, and am at the point where my mind and body are
arguing over whether or not I'm tired and I'm at that cracked-out stage of
total noncommunication but I have to express myself anyway, as best I can.
All I can say is that last night I felt like I did when I was at my first
party, like I was discovering the scene all over again.  Maybe it was the
whole newness of the city or meeting all the new people, but I had almost
forgotten that that feeling existed, and I'm so glad I was reminded.  The
vibe was so pure, so genuine.  The music and the people were so diverse yet
so unified, and EVERYONE was weird in the most wonderful way. It was so
nice to meet you all.  Best of all, there were no attitudes.  Total
acceptance and encouragement of individuality.  Thank you Lorianne for
showing me around/introducing me to people, and thank you to everyone else
I met (I remember most of your names, and definitely remember your faces).
I was dancing to this incredible DJ, swimming in the vibe, in the love, in
the FUN!, feeling so at home, so perfect, when "Dan? Oh my God!!!!!"
HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE HUG and some of my friends who I have known since before
I started going to parties were there, totally unexpected by me, and my
smile kept getting bigger and as the night went on I re-remembered why I
had gotten into the whole scene and that there is hope and it was one big
family and I talked to so many people, made so many new friends, which I
definitely haven't done enough of recently at parties, maybe I had been
getting too comfortable, too familiar, and I had forgotten what it was
about the scene that I love, and why haven't I been the person who I would
want to know if I were someone else meeting me? , and time went by so
slowly, which was a great thing because usually it seems the party's over
just as I'm starting to get down (not down, but DOWWWWN!), but last night
it was like: what, it's only one-thirty?  Damn, I thought it was around
five.  HELLL YEAH!!!  And I just danced and danced and talked to people and
why haven't I really danced for so long?, and the vibe surrounded me,
filled me, became me, but I was also able to experience the vibe as Dan at
the same time as experiencing being the vibe, and I did not experience a
single negative vibe all night, and WOW!!!  I haven't had that much FUN or
felt this good coming from a party in a long time.  Thank you so much to
everyone who was there.  It really felt like a big family.  Thank you for
allowing me to be a part of it.  Everyone should definitely check out the
Erie scene when he/she gets a chance.  I'm pretty sure there's a club night
every Friday at Fusion Records, which has the feel more like your best
friend's basement, than the feel of a typical club.  Sorry if my thoughts
are a bit jumbled and rambling.  I'm going to go because I'm starting to
form pictures with the empty spaces between words, which is more fun right
now than writing... Love, Dan

Im glad you had a good time too... as did I.  I got to meet Eric which was
cool, even if it was just for a quick second :)  The vibe was great, as it
always is here, and even though i wasnt there the whole night it was still
bomb.  Too bad 7up didnt make it... i was kinda lookin forward to him.  If my
camera wouldnt have gone bananas i wouldve had more pics.. owell... see all
you kool kids at magick....

This sounds like a cool idea kidz. I'm up for it...but how about letting 
a list-member's boyfriend spin? My boy just made his first tape and is 
looking to try and get spinning out. He spins jungle and goes by 
Wiseman...oh, and if anyone else is interested in hearing it for 
promotion's sake, I can prolly get you a tape out if you send me your 
addy. I'm trying to help him get off his feet. Thanks so much :)

This is not yet for sure, but I may be doing a second room for Catch 22 (which by the way is on fri Dec.11)
If I do have a second room, it will be for open tables.
I see that there is a lot of undiscovered talent on the list. So i would like to give some of you guys (or gals) a chance to play out. If I do the second room, I will make time slots available to list dj's first. But please understand that I will only have around 8 time slots, so everyone who wants to spin will not be able to. So, if you are interested, contact me SOON, e-mail is good, or call the infoline #216.556.5519, if you call please specify that you are a list member. Please note: You have a better chance of getting a slot if I get a tape so I can check the skillz fo'myself. I like to here a DJ before i book one. Even if it is just open tables. If you have a tape, you can get it to me one of two ways : give it to me in person, I am really easy to find, if you don't know I am 6'11", I am always out and about promoting so e-mail me and I will let you what party I will be at next, if you wanna gimmee a tape in person. Or you can let da mailman handle yo bizznes by snailing me a tape to :

           Vicious Circle Productions c/o Greg
           789 1/2 Bryson
           Youngstown, OH 44502

(pleae, no letter bombs)

And like I said before, not everyone who wants to play will get to because of limited time slots. So contact me SOON (i.e. NOW!!!) if you are interested.

Hey kids,
	Couple more things about Kathy's party.  The reason we said anything about
Trilogy was because I had spoken with Rob Sherwood and he said he would be
able to arrange Trilogy as the space.  He had also told me he would get
Keoki to play.  I'm assuming he forgot about all this because nobody knows
anything and he's not returning any of my calls.
	As far as Doug and Grand Poo-bas, you guys have no worries from the Fame
camp.  It's very evident we are all good people trying to wade through this
tide of drama to do some good.
	I'll apologize for Kathy in regards to her phone call to you.  All this is
really hard for her and this party really will determine how she lives the
rest of her life.
	Respect to all, Peace.

i'm kinda wondering what the hell he would do if he was there? i doubt
he preforms much solo... would he wu's dj or just rap over a dat? i'm
a moderate wu fan, but i don't know if cappa bein' @ a rave solo would
make much sense. probably only about a half hour preformance tops
unless he pulls some suprises.

thought this was something interesting, if nothing else.

good to see that the crane space hasn't gone to waste. so
glad to see quality acts like ICP are using the space rather
than having it go to those cracked over raver kids and thier
all-nite drug parties.

excuse me while i go puke...




ok, i'm back. : >

anyway, maybe somebody on the list can win the free tickets.

peace,

re GWAR n ICP Show

I hear these bands make great use of fake blood and spray faygo pop into
the crowd.  Talk about a mess.  I think that with the recent sucess of
ATOMIC Thursdays the Metropol crew should be more open to holding another
real party there, and a lot less trouble to clean up. :)

plur,
jbrick

yes, they do.

actually, from seeing a couple of their vids, seeing a GWAR show live
wouldn't be *too* bad, but i can't stand ICP.

working at national record mart over the summer and having kids coming in
every day asking for that shit and they hearing how bad it was really put
them on my shit list as far as 'new rap' goes.

--spike

p.s. jeff, i totally agree with ya on having another party at the crane, but
for whatever reason, i don't see it happening. not for a while, anyway...

<<I have a few questions to raise about this.
Did anyone on this list, besides Ed Luna, attend this meeting last night in
Columbus? My brother did (Kevin Grimm, aka DJ Kevy Kev), and he called me
today to fill me in on what basically took place.>>

in attendance were:

brian wheeler - UPS
yabette - UPS, Plus magazine
rob rage - multiple eargasm productions, intergrated records
doughboy - pitch control productions,  rotation/red zone
kevy kev - kg2 graphics, network 23
ed luna - ele mental productions
kevin placebo - ele mental productions
sid - surreal productions
anthony - organized crime productions
victor - two tigers productions
lou - shortarm productions
steve ford - fame records
leslie viktoria - collective intelligence
tomo - lotek productions
nicole - pressure productions

myself, and a whole slew of non-promotors

those who expressed interest but were unable to make the meeting
due to previous engagements include:

jason lemonlyman - middle/maxwells
j3 - tri-quad productions
eric - e productions
brian - sphere productions

here is a basic synopsis of the meeting:

* everybody introduced themselves
* ed passed out his proposal for his idea of how he thinks FA5 should
   be organized...in a nutshell, he believes FA5 should have no central
   promotor...each production company would be responsible for their
   own sound system...in addition everyone should pay admission (even
   the dj's & the promotors)...and finally, it should be a non-profit
   party (everyone will be doing it out of love for the music rather
   than profit)
* rob pointed out no matter what, the owner of the venue will have to
   be paid, so some admission price will have to be charged, but who
   will be responsible for that money & what will happen to it if there
   is a profit from that
* kevy kev pointed out the problem w/ initial investment...he suggested
   similar to europe, we use some corporate sponsorship (for example:
   the smile tour that sleepy c did w/ urb magazine, pervert, and pm
   magazine for its sponsors or the upcoming red zone halloween party
   w/ coors & wnci as its sponsors)
* brian explained the different themes of each of the family affairs &
   that family affair has always been simply that 'our family' of ohio
   promotors w/o any outside sponsorship...thus underground peace 
   society (this is my interpretation of what he said)
* i defended brian & ed by pointing out that a non-profit large scale
   party w/ multiple sound systems was not a new concept and very
   feasible...my chief examples were the interstellar outback partys
   and the further partys (which were the main influences for family
   affair to begin with)...interstellar was a successful series of
   non-profit partys and further was a suceesful series of partys
   that utilized multiple sound systems

there were a few other points that i don't recall, but for the next
meeting, i hope to include JJ (the man behind Interstellar), more
cleveland promotors and more dayton & cincinnati promotors...

need to pick?  Let's first see how many
DJs would actually be willing to spin.

So,

ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SPIN AT THE PB-CLE RAVE,
WRITE IN TO THE LIST.  INCLUDE WHAT TYPE 
OF MUSIC YOU SPIN.

How's that?

Yes, I fuckin hate ICP.
My roommate listens to that shit all the time.
Please, make it stop...

And yes, Gwar is pretty damn cool.
Especially in concert.
They blow "loads" out of their huge
cocks, pump "blood" all o'er the crowd,
etc.  Pretty vulgar.
Last Halloween I went to their concert.
Among other things, they ripped off 
"Princess Diana's" arms and legs and
fucked what was left.  Damn.
Everyone on the lower level left
soaking, with pink/red shirts!

Oh well.

<one of the better forwards that I've seen ;>

"Did you know?"

If shop mannequins were real women, THEY'D BE TOO THIN TO MENSTRUATE.

There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels and ONLY 8 WHO
DO.

Marilyn Monroe wore a SIZE 12.

If Barbie were a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due to her
proportions.

The average American woman weighs 144 lbs. and wears between a size 12
and 14.

One out of every 4 college age women has an eating disorder.

The models in the magazines are airbrushed - THEY'RE NOT PERFECT!!

A psychological study in 1995 found that 3 minutes spent looking at
models in a fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed,
guilty and shameful.

Models who twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman,
today weigh 23% less.

Please send this to every woman you know. There is no sense in our
generation of women and future generations of women torturing themselves
to look thin. We're simply being lied to. Love yourself for who you
are, not what you look like. "

What's up? This is Bri@n from Sphere, and I would like to help out withg
this party. It sounds like a great idea, and it would be really great if
we could have something go down for free, but it might be tough, unless
we have enough donations, that can cover rental of a space. But I'm
willing to donate any suggestions, help or whatever for this.
peace.
Bri@n

p.s. thanks to everyone who came out to Barely Legal, I had a great
birthday. Look out for Be Square on December 25th and 26th.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my post for promotional 
consideration of my boy's tape. We're working on getting them 
mass-produced and it might be just a week or so, but to all of you who 
responded, I"m working on getting your tapes out. If anyone else wants 
one for promotional purposes, just drop me a line and I'll do my best to 
comply. Thanks in advance for all your support :)

Yep - there's at least two ideas, bordering on dozens of ideas here. 
And thats good - there's folks with ideas.  We've talked about this in the
past, and even had some things like it too in the not so distant past, and
going back, there's been lots of things with high pb-cle involvement
(probably some old ones before i was on here).

Some things:  Spike's Gad Party, Trouty's Commencement, MSKW's barbeque
(and events before that), and Phat Andy's BBQ.  These were all fun and
at least somewhat successful (well trouty may have something to say on
that) events with alot of pb-cle involvement, or straight-up trying to get
kids together.

I think the concencus is we want to go bigger than these things.
How big to go though? Its open to debate at this point of course.
After thinking and reading some other thoughtful posts, I'm thinking from
the inside out approach is best.  

Our own djs, mostly us and our friends, a decent space and sound +
whatever else happens to come together.  I'm all for keeping it open to
people not assocaited with list folk, but not majorly promoting.

Of course, in person discussion helps, because if we're not agreeing on a
mass level all at once, then its pretty useless.

Another BBQ/Pillow party is cool by me too, but i think the idea here is
to go beyond that level.  I'm all for more of those too, but my house
isn't the best for that kinda stuff.

In concept here's one way it could go:  

- vote on a good date when everyone can come, nothing else going on

- book a space at a central location - Youngstown? 
  i think that figure of 400-500 sounds reasonable.
  cheap is good, but i think $1000 is probably on the order of what
  we'd need to accomidate us.  Anyone know of a free or cheap centrally
  located space that holds 4-500?  No i didn't think so.

- sound and lights - we have at least one free soundsystem,
  and wizard workshop i'm sure would be involved in some way
  lights - we can go ghetto and have everyone bring something 
  i'm sure i can hook up some video projector(s) - anyone else?
  I know Type-O is on the list - are you guys into doing this?

- turntables and mixers - i'm sure we have probably 10 pairs available

- djs: there's alot on here, so forgive if i forget any, but i know:
  lemon lyman, circuit 6, reliant, trouty, dave h, elias, jeff chung,
  digital jesus, josh ryan, da mofo, kira, mskw, ed umm (ok i'm including
  infrequent posters....stand up if your into spinnin'!)  

- i think that dj real-audio thing is a good idea to do just for the hell
  of it.  at the same time, i can't imagine we have too many acts that
  we can't fit everyone who wants to play in there...maybe i'm wrong?

- funding: i think if we have an in-person meeting we can discuss this.
  the most reasonably way to do it would to have a core of a few people
  invest on the down-payments that are needed.  at that point we can
  deceide on a cost for the event.  a worst-case scenario i think would 
  be charging $5 at the door, and less is very very possible i think.
  hopefully the space will be the only major cost and we can get
  everything else volunteered.  

- the day of, we all show up and decorate the place like mad,
  bring all our toys and games and comfort items, candy, etc...
  hook it up as a realaudio broadcast hopefully.

- everyone busts a move.

- this list is by no means well organized or comprehensive, but just
  my thoughts as i write them down.  any comments/additions?

I'm hoping this thing can be a product of *everyones*
creativity/special talents - not just the product of a few kids or just
the vocal posting types.  Speak up lurkers - if you're pro or con.

Y-town may look like a good location but its really a hassle to deal with local authority, I did a party last July (phunked up) at a warehouse and it got busted around 12:30. The space was phat, and I got it for free, but the cops were violent minded assholes at the least. Sphere and Happy Head tried there luck (wierd science) in August at a bar way out in the boonies, it was successful (300+) but it got shut down at 4:00am. I strongly advise against doing this party for any kind of profit, money will only lead to arguments among list members.

I have a feeling that we can have everyone spin who wants to and 
can make it...unless we're limiting it to like 6 djs with 1.5-2 hour
sets with only one room or something like that.

Doctor Cut-Ups would like to volunteer (as if we didn't already know).
I can spin jungle, happy hardcore, gabber or oldskool uk hardcore.
I also like to spin yak-fur sweaters on my loom.

Maybe we should keep a list of dj's who want to spin at the pb-cle party,
sort of like we do for netmeets, to have an idea of who and how many there
are.  I would have compiled one, but have deleted most of my messages in
regards to dj's, but hopefully someone out there hasn't...

i completely agree.. with both of them. i recently read/heard/saw (i dont
remember which) someone say something like, if i was gonna throw a party, i
wouldnt spend a lot of time/money on flyers.. id just hand out small pieces of
colored paper with a date and a phone number on them.. and leave the rest to
word of mouth...  would that eliminate some shade? maybe.. i just really like
the idea of a small party, with list member djs or friends of list members,
and that sorta thing.. as for the "kinkos-copied handouts" for flyers.. ive
got the copy max connection, so keep that in mind if you decide to go with
somethin like that. (and i get really bored at work so this would give me
something to do. heh) um.. thats it i guess.

There was a party this weekend in Bloomington and someone from Cincy

	Look at the title :)  Is it worth it?? Does anybody have one?
Tell me about it...mostly I want to know if it's worth the price, how much
it costs lately, and if it has plenty of options to keep me interested for
a good long time.  Thanks ahead of time!

The 505 is really nice, as long as you plan to do a lot of your own composing, if you want want one just to play with the presets don't bother wasting money. I love mine, but I am still learning it and I have had it for a few months. Make sure you are serious about what you want to use it for before you drop $1200 on one. maybe even consider getting a used 303 first.

  ""Bizarre new dance makes teens high - and its sweeping the Holy
Land!"

 TEL AVIV, Israel -- A bizarre dance craze, in which people bob their
heads and flail their limbs frenetically for up to 24 hours at a time,
is sweeping the Holy land. And fans claim it induces an incredible high!

 But worried police officials have cracked down on the fad, known as
"trance-dancing," arguing that it is a threat to society.
 Trance-dancers kick up their heels to a weird new form of loud,
computer-generated music played mostly in Israel. The throbbing,
hypnotic beat is so addictive that tens of thousands of young Israelis
have been caught up in the trance-dance subculture.
 At dance clubs - which are decorated with way-out psychedelic art,
including neon butterflies, smiling alligators and fast-spinning
pinwheels - men and women whip themselves into a frenzy, doing the
uninhibited dance for as long as 24 hours at a stretch before
collapsing. Officials believe hallucinogenic drugs must be involved in
the all-night parties and have used that as an excuse to call for a war
against trance-dancing.
 But when police recently raided a trance-dance party held at the home
of an Israeli socialite, no drugs were found. Still, cops shut down the
party.
 "THis kind of wild, crazy behavior could be even more dangerous to
society if there are no drugs involved", explained a police spokesman.
Experts believe that the stress of living in the embattled Middle
Eastern nation is drawing more and more people into trance-dancing.""

I scored a 75 on the sleaze test!
Wow, I thought I'd be well into the 
hundreds.  
I amassed most of my points in the
first 20 questions, though.
I suppose that if I was actually able
to score some points in the sex categories,
I would be over a 200.
Heh.

don't blame me.  Just E-mail me or the list

Also, maybe it would be a good idea to
make sure the acts are satisfactory.
I know Ken is good, I heard him.  Kick ass.

Maybe it would be a good idea, however,
to have a site of Audio files of all
the performers.  It'd be handy.

Gill agreed to host the audio files on his server. However, his
only hitch is that they be in a certain type of format whose encoder is
free to download. It's some kind of Microsoft encoder, but I'll have to
ask him when I talk to him later today.

I really hate having to keep doning this, but once again I am in search
of a ride. Is anyone in the Toledo, Detroit or Bowling Green area going
to Channel Jive in Dayton this weekend??? I always bring lots of goodies
and will help chip in for gas. You can mail me back or give me a call at
419-578-2436
            peace

I am not going to say that I'll
spin for sure until I get some
feedback of my skills, or lack of.

Hopefully I'll make a tape soon
or spin in front of some list members.

My set would be only about
30-45 min long.
We'll see.

Okay, I got a 172 -- but I couldn't answer most of the drinking
questions, which means if I were a drinker I probably would have made
it over 200.  Woo hoo!

And yes, I have had my eyeball licked. ;-)

As of now there are 12 performers.
Please send me the info that is
now ??? so I can update.

If each person spins 30-60 min.,
it would take 6-12 hrs.
A good bet would be 45 min. each.
More or less depending on performer,
skill, or preference.

Goal:  9 hours.
11:00 pm to 8:00 am.
So far we are perfect.

i like the idea of a meeting at andy the poohs with a bbq thing again, tho
its not particularly central.  i'd have it here in youngstown, but our yard
is nonexistant, but there are 1200s here and small sound, as in lousy sound
????   more indoors than anything really.  i have a yard in hermitage, near
here that we could bbq at,  as long as we werent super loud the neighbors
are cool.

>- book a space at a central location - Youngstown? 
sounds like great idea to me  =)    no i'm not biased here, not one bit.

i'd be all for a live pa or spinning at it.   and dontate my mixer / 1200s
and some small lights and video games and stuff like that.

well we've never had serious run-ins with the po-po here (battered armadillo).
our 1st party was about a block away from the station.  no problems, they
slowed down and looked, we waved they waved and no problems all night.
second party or third, i forget, the cops showed up at 9:30 saying they had
a call from a parent whose child came home slobbering drunk from our party.
the party hadnt started, we hadnt let anyone in, there was alcohol, but we
hid it before they came in.  they looked around asked what we were doing
and talked to the owner of the coffee shop, guess they knew him, the talked
about 15 mins and they told us to have fun and left.  no return visit.
someone called the cops again on impulse's party last halloween, they got
shut down 3-4 oclock due to zoning violations (i think)  we were accused of
calling the cops, wasnt us.
my graduation the po-po stopped by coz he could hear it from his car.  he
asked that we turn it down, we shut the front door, he said that was fine.
he drove by later on, but didnt stop back.
i dont know the details of your warehouse party (deep blue), but you did
mention a bit of it a few months back, was there a call to the police?
as for barely legal, you were asking for trouble having it at the outer
limits.  i even told brian that when he told me where it was.  tho i guess
the problems werent from the cops, rather the owner,  dunno how much of a
hassle the cops were, they seemed more concerned about loitering in the lot
when i said hi to them.  =)  
our pet theory is that someone formerly involved with the ygn scene that no
longer is because, well everyone hates him, is pissed coz the ygn scene
went on without him is calling the cops on anyone doing anything in ygn.  i
dont kno the truth to this, but i tend to go along with the theory, coz i
do know for a fact that he still collects flyers locally from one of the
flyer drop points.
but anyhow, i know a few larger spaces here, one has occupancy, the other
might or might not.  thats really the most the po-po seems to be going for
at this point.
i guess its something to consider?
trouty.

hey does anybody want to go trick or treating with me? i am in the
cleveland area, but i'll end up in the pittsburgh are at some point
before majick. i don't know when trick or treating is in any
particular neighborhood (sometimes it's a different day or not at
night). the reason why it is fair for me to go trick or treating even
though i'm an adult is that if i go, i'm going to give several huge
bags of candy to somebody handing it out so essentially i'll just be
indirectly trading candy, and nobody can tell how old i am anyway.
i'm going to be a bank robber for halloween. but my gun is a
glow-in-the-dark squirt gun =] so the cops don't think its real and
shoot me. =O

This post made me think about it:  how old do kids go out
trick-or-treatin' in your neighborhood?  The last time i went out was
when i was 15, and all kinds of old ladies were bitching about
old kids coming out, so i just deceided to not go anymore.

But dammit, i love free candy!!!  

Everyone should go out any age, as long as you dress up.  

Now, nobody better show up at my door and say
"Trick or treat, I'm a candy raver"

does anybody have any advice on inducing and controlling out of body
experiences? i've had 1 that was accidental + uncontrolled (result of
massive candyflip) but it would be cool to be able to go where you
want like i read some people can do. i've been re-
reading thru this book "the holographic universe" (recommended by
somebody on the mw-list; source of the quote i just put in my
signature) which reminded me about that. also does anybody know of a
3-d interactive web-based map of the known universe or of galaxies? i
don't know if one exists but that would be helpful so you can know
where you're going in an o.b.e. (if you make it to outer space, which
might be difficult).

something else in that book (a little more rave related maybe) is this
part about stanislav grof, a psychaiatrist who did research in the 50s
on theraputic uses of LSD. his subjects experienced things that had
never occured in psychiatric studies, like reliving the experience of
being in the womb. he thought they were imagined experiences, until
the patients, who had no more knowledge of biology and physiology than
the average person, described accurate details of blood circulation in
the placenta, cellular functioning, etc.
the same accuracy occured as subjects experienced things like being a
dinosaur, a soldier of ghengis khan, a victim of an aztec sacrifice, a
blood cell, a thermonuclear process in the sun, or the consciousness
of the cosmos. he guided >3000 of these sessions at least 5 hrs each.
i can't figure out why nothing anywhere nearly as cool happens to me
on acid. =] anyway he developed this "holotropic therapy" that uses no
drugs and wrote this book: The Adventure of Self Discovery, that i
guess explains how to do all this. well i'm going to read the book but
if you've got advice for me, let me know.

another extremely amazing book, Mass Dreams of the Future, by Chet B.
Snow and Helen Wambach, is written about in The Holographic Universe.
It is about the results of this study in which 2500 people were
hypnotized (separately) and guided into a future time period. their
responses ended up in 4 categories:
1. people living unhappily in space stations
2. happy, new age lives in natural environments
3. lives in mechanical cities underground or under    glass domes
4. survivors of global disaster living primitively in    urban ruins
or on farms
the theory is that these are the potential futures of humanity and
what we're doing now is going to determine which we end up in. the
book goes kind of heavy on this new age schmaltz but if you can
overlook that, definitely read it. personally i prefer option 3
underground, but without the environmental destruction + pollution
that went with it.

131-160 You're enjoying life to the max.
161-200 You're a danger to society.  Who let you out on a day pass?
200+    You're going straight to hell.

hahaha... well i'm 17 and i haven't missed a trick or treat yet!
(don't plan on it this year either, goddamnit!

last year this old woman chewed us the f*$k out cause we were too
old... 

us: "trick or treat?"
her: "you should be ashamed of yourselves! trick or treating is for 6
year olds, not 16 year olds!" 
us: "um.... trick or treat?"
*door slam*

most people could care less, and the best part about it is that since
we are the oldest and stay out the latest, everyone gets rid of the
rest of their candy on us!

brother or sister, then just go along with them, holding out your pillow case

Hello I've got a small sample of a song that is soo cool and I can't find
out the name of it, if there's anybody that would like to help me figure out
that the name is I would appreciate it.  I'll send you the 25 second clip
and...  It came off of a DRC mixtape, called rendition right near the end of
the 2nd side I believe.

Thanks
Curtis

It's just advertising that you can't get any!

i got a 84, or something close to that. Im not quite normal, though =p.
someone claims to have gotten a 7. hmmmm.....

about the pb-cle party , I think its an excellent idea, being new to the
list, I think it'd be an great way to meet other members. I dont have
much cash to spare and I really dont have any connections, but I hope  I
can help in some way
Due to some bad circumstances, I couldnt make it to Impact, how was it?
Is Club Insomnia still happening this Fri? Have lots of people started
to come?
last but not least, is anyone from Erie or vicinity going to Magick? I
may need a ride for my sorry butt...
much plur to everyone~~

magick will be a major disaster if they use only the paintball lobby in which
illusions was held.  i think about 2,000 kids are expected.

I've got 188 if I added right.  (Can't remember anyone ever licking my
eyeball)

Does anybody remember the purity test that this one probably evolved from? 
It was ridiculously long, and every few months, it would get expanded.  I
think the biggest one I saw had 600 or 700 questions.  (Have you ever had
sex on a boat of under 3 tons?  Have you ever had sex on a boat of over 3
tons?  Have you ever placed a small animal...never mind.)  It got to be
"the thing to do" for a while among the University/Internet nerd set. 
You'd even see notices for "Purity Test parties" posted on BBSs.  Anyway,
one of the questions went something like "Have you ever done something
solely for the purpose of lowering your purity test score?"  Well, I guess
it's time for me to go get in a bar fight...

So I did these purity tests and it seems according to Sleaze, I'm normal
with a whopping 71.  According to Dr. Suess, I have an even 60.  What
exactly does that mean?  Am I 60% pure?  Not quite Ivory.  Then again, we
all know about the Ivory Snow girl!

First off i just wanna say that I havent been this disappointed since i found
out Rupaul wasn't a woman. ;) the sound was absolutley horrible. The speakers
sounded like a pre-pubesent 14 yr old boy trying to sing Ava Maria. It did
everything but sound good. You know what i'm not even gonna waste my time
reviewing this. How can one review shit? it looks bad, and it stinks that's ow
te show was.

i was thinkin about something:

before we start pickin djs to spin, we've really gotta figure out what
kind of event it will be. large scale, small scale... what? then the
issue of quality control comes up... if it is a smaller party with
basically just listmembers, i dont really think it matters who's
spinning, cause it is good to give everyone a chance (this and other
such events provided me with a chance to spin out back when i was a
dj-gimp :)... but if it is a big rave that we are going to invte lots
of people too, i don't think it is a good idea to let whoever wants to
spin... i know not many people actually care about the MUSIC @ raves
or anything, but the thought of a trainwreckin dj in the main room
ain't a pretty one, especially since the djs will be representin' pb-cle

i hope i dont sound like a jerk here, i've just been thinkin about the
party a bit and that's a slight problem i came across...

i think the best scenario would be a 2 room event, 1 slightly larger
than the other, with the "bigger acts" from the list, and possibly a
dj or two that aren't on the list, just to keep it interesting and
perhaps draw a couple more people to the rave. in the other room, we
could have all pb-cle djs, and we could make sure that there were
always 2 different styles of music playing in the 2 different rooms,
so people are likely to check out the new acts, too...

any thoughts?

	This was definitly the biggest let-down since I've been going out
to parties. :(  This was my first time at the Grog Shop...and it's quite
possibly the worst space I've ever seen!  Columns everywhere obstructing
the view of the main stage...almost NO room for the 250 people it's
supposed to hold.  The sound was absolute garbage.  I was behind the sound
man the entire time and I just wanted to slap him upside the back of the
head.  The Treble shrieked WAY to loudly the entire night and as for the
bass...lets just say my dorm room has more thump than this club, no
kidding.
	But that should have been ok, cuz afterall, dj shadow was in the
building.  The fact that he was there was what kept me in there listening
to 3 horrible rap groups while the entire crowd just stood there.  Me, I
was in a booth in the corner reading the paper.  So finally Shadow is
about to come on, I get excited...then he calls...no, not calls....BEGS
the crowd for an encore for this shitty rap group he's promoting, I think
their name is Latryx?  Anyways...Shadow is about to hit the stage
(finally) but then says "No..fuck that.  Fuck that.  You guys need to
applaud for Latryx so they'll play again."

	Personally, I'd rather see how many cotton-balls I can jam in my
eye socket than here anymore of  this shit.

	So Latryx does one more "wave your hands in the air" bullshit,
processed track and FINALLY Shadow hits the stage.  Thoughts of
Entroducing fill my mind....Shadow drops the needle and....

	MORE PROCESSED, BULLSHIT RAP MUSIC!!! He actually had to TELL the
crowd to dance!!!!  It was awful!  And I'm not comming down on rap music,
I like it...there's good shit out there....but it wasn't in the Grog last
night.  Shadow just continued with the frat party atmosphere and we just
walked out the door during his set.

	Awful disappointment.

Wondering where the intelligence in Shadow's music went,

brian<------bitter. ;P

i get some college kids here, and very few younger kids.  mostly coz its
99% college puke up here.  anyhow i usually get a case of cheap beer and
give that out for trick or treat.  its usually pretty popular.
last time i went out was when i was 20, i keep meaning to, but not in my
neighborhood, i'd have to go out of the area really.
i have my costume all ready for this year, its a good one  =)
see ya at magick!

Okay, I think that we need to vote about what kind of party we want before
progressing further. Even if we don't agree on anything, I think that we
all would agree that this party is meant to be an expression of this list,
and that means that everyone has a say, no matter how much or how little
you have to contribute. So far the discussion has been dominated by the
same group of people, so this is a chance for all those lurkers to
respond. :)

If you had to choose one option, 
WHAT KIND OF PARTY DO YOU FAVOR?


	o	a small pillow/bbq/house party gathering


	o	a mid-sized simple party


	o 	an all-out rave/multiroom party







I think after we come to a consensus on this issue, we can move on to
other planning. 


Kate

I think a mid size simple party is the best way to go!  KEEP IT SIMPLE!

I think we should have a one room all day all night party instead of a 2
room party.  This would make the first part of the day more social perhaps
and then at night we could have a bigger more public audience, maybe even
getting a medium-well known local DJ or 2 to get a nice crowd.  Perhpas
this way we wouldn't have to choose between 2 listers who will be spinning
at the same time.

plur,

i agree with frankie g...a mid-size party would be the most realistic in
terms of available resources (money & time)...but i think we should aim
for a 2 room party...something along the lines of sounds from planet
bass...

I think i have to agree with the spy on this one. Not a total disaster, but pretty messy. I mean it's plenty big for a 2,000+ party. The arena's are huge. The lobby area is nice and clean. But, the actual paintball areana could be a problem. In the arena, the floor is all covered with sawdust to catch the paint. I was talking to the owner when i was down there for illusions and he said that they were thinking about just pushing all the sawdust off to the side. but, there's still gonna be some paint on the floor. they can't just hose it down, cuz the floor isn't watertight, and it would leak into that costume shop and metropol and shit. I dunno, maybe that's just extra incentive to get dressed up in a costume you don't really care about. I'm still gonna bring some garbage bags for my seats on the ride home tho. :)

I vote for the mid-size party.  I prefer one room, but if we had two, I
think we should have alternating time slots(i.e. one room's slot going from
12-1, the other going from 12:30-1:30, etc.), so that only half of a dj's
set overlaps with another, so that even if two dj's/performers that you
really wanted to see are playing at the same time, you can see parts of
both sets without having to go back and forth.  I also think we should keep
it to only list dj's because a) we have the talent and b)how are we ever
going to be able to come to an agreement as to what outside dj's to bring
in?   As to bringing in a nice crowd, I think we have a nice crowd already
between us and our guests alone.  I don't think we should exclude anybody,
but I don't think size should be our priority, the vibe should be.  PLUR,
Dan

think simple

among those on the list
we have the knowledge, skill, talent
resources, hell, we have 
whatever we need to
throw any type of party
and be successful

everybody has a skill
find it, and use it
together, that should be our focus

why not bring
our individual talents together
to do something good
to have something to show for it

by beginning with a simple
task, we are assured success 
and we can enjoy ourselves


enjoy-
moe

I agree 100% with the message below.
I still think we should (not too heavily) promote for this party, though. I
just think that we all have a really good vibe, and this would be a perfect
oppurtunity to show it off!! Also, to make sure we are all talking about the
same thing, what's a mid- size party, in terms of numbers?
love,
Amber

I think that since spaces are so hard to come by, need to find a space
first and build party around it.

The "day time" thing isn't a bad idea (Ultraworld).  Definitely easier to find
a space for that.

	Just a quick reminder.

	For those interested.

	Dieselboy, flexing in full, along side Bricks, and
	our talented resident, DJ Sine.

	All ages welcome, $5US.

	Also, he'll be playing drum n' bass tonight, and a special
	house set at Metropol.

	Two seperate sets, both worth checking out.

A BBQ before hand would definitly be in order.  Nothing like a good
barbeque to get things rolling.
Would this event be in PA or Ohio?  I'd vote for Pittsburgh, but I'm biased.

it down, cuz the floor isn't watertight, and it would leak into that 
costume shop and metropol and shit. I dunno, maybe that's just extra 

I didn't realize that you guys were talking about the building that
the Metropol is in. It would be _totally_ awesome to have a party
on the fourth or fifth floor of that building. They are just huge 
rooms, the size of the whole building. Steve Ford knows what I am
talking about...

I have actually asked my friend, whose dad owns the building, about
the possibility of having a party there. He doesn't seem to think
that his dad would go for it, though.

i'd hafta go with 
2 with some tightass pre-party barbeque action in the early eve, or 
3 with as much spreadin by wordOfMouth we can muster

i'd be all about a phat barbeque, though, so i'm leanin towards 2.

Well, the day before or the day of the Pb-sicle rave.
(We should have a logo like the Popsicle one!)

Anyway, here's a plan.  Feel free to shoot it down.
We have a bonfire, camp out and stuff, sleep,
party all day at Andy the Pooh's BBQ.
Then we set up and throw the Party that nite.

It would have to be nice weather.  (Spring)
If that is too far off, ok.
If not, we could have an Easter theme
(and use PAAS characters on the flyer!)

T'would be half way between Pb and Cle.

I think that this whole idea is so cool,  I have experienced one netmeet and
that was cool, just think - a whole party of pb-cle peoples.   My vote is for
a mid-sized simple party.  I think only list members should spin because I
would love to hear the talent that others have in the group -and I think it
would make it more memorable.  Lets support each other -dig.  cool   Just my
opinion

I would have to go w/ the second choice med. size &
simple. But i think we should at least bring in a good
DJ/act just to headline the party. somone we would all
like to hear spin. I think it would be great for us all
to sit back and appreciate what we created as a team. I
also know that alot of us including myself have dreamed
of throwing a party. This may be  the closest some of
us ever get to that dream. well just a few thoughts
plur

RIGHT ON!!!

all list members, up front, enjoyin what they helped to create as a
big group effort. if this ever happens it'll make a very happy guy.
now all we gotta do is agree on one headlining dj... is this possible?
it couldn't be jungle or happy hardcore, cause if you don't like em,
you don't like em, and couldn't enjoy iy... hmmmmmm

mid-sized is my vote, but the daytime/social side of it should be central
to it as well.  hard to get to know anyone while yelling.  perhaps a
dinner kind of thing, pot luck even.  meet at the space around 7-8 PM,
hang out, talk shit, set up the party, start by 11 PM.

and yeah, the space/location should be the next thing on the agenda.  what
city is this even going to be in??  i vote for youngstown because it's
"relatively" central to the pb-cle area (trouty?).

oh, and before i forget, i would love to play a event-ending set of weird
atmospheric techno, if anyone cares.  i promise i won't play hardcore
(unless asked politely ;)

some of the list members have made excellent points about what kind of 
party to have and in my mind it all points to.....

a really phat mid size party   

hopefully,  two rooms to give all the talented pb-cle kidz   and a $5 
cover to pay for the space .
if this goes really well i say we go into the rave business so we can 
keep the vibe alive  (only slightly joking)  =)

TODD

OK ... more specifics.... MY VOTE...  list memebers only ....        BBQ 
in early evening...  2 rooms of CONTINOUS SOUND 

Personally i wouldn't like a 24 hour party (too hard to keep my 
geriatric/attention deficency disordered ass awake)
 and DEFINITELY continous sound as who wants to be busting a move to a 
good house set in room #1 and have the sound shut down and have to go to 
room #2 where someone is spinning jungle or sit on the floor in room #1 
for a half hour until another Dj/act starts to play!!!!  
 if you like a set so much you forget to go check out the other room 
than don't feel too bad cause you obviously had fun and for the people 
who don't like the set ...there is always the other room...

before you get too freaked out you should check his main page-
you can d/l the photoshop plug-ins he used to make those pics with-
although i agree they are really good, and genuinely eerie

you should check out this shady website.  I don't really know what to

please play hardcore?
polite enuff..??
ygn is iffy,  the last few events have had problems, mostly occupancy and
such, i know of some bingo halls and places like that that i've put in the
back of my mind, i dunno how useable they are.
i like the daytime idea, but i've never had luck getting ppl to come early
and hang out,  they wander in at 9ish usually, but i suppose if we planned
it that way it could work.  i usually decided the week before....

Andy, I think that maybe you should choose the date yourself, because
you'll have a million different dates being proposed.  If you come up
with a date, far in advanced so people can  adjust their schedules to
attend.


Sincerely

Why would you go to see DJ Shadow and Blacklalicious(whose album is very PHAT)
if you don't like Hip hop?  Sounds like you wanted to waste some money that

it ain't gonna happen.

A reminder to all.  The PinkWigGirl has dedicated her photography skills
and will be in charge of taking professional photos at Magick.  I'll
have a list posted of what groups are to meet where and at what time to
get their picture taken.  There will, of course be a pb-cle picture.
Dierdre will sell them at cost on Nov 13 at Dawn.  Probably $1 a piece.

Did any of you guys go to see the Crytstal Method at the Agora?
 I thought they kicked ass! DJ Taylor spun for like almost two hours and 
was the shit (I bought his live tape and it rules). Lunatic Calm was the 
opener after Mike Filly (or Philly I don't know) spun. Lunatic Calm 
kicks ass it's too bad that there weren't too many people there when 
they played, their keyboardist went off on his Korg Prophecy and his 
guitar , the live drummer w/the drum machine sounded awesome and the 
singer/keyboardist ( jp-8000) was really cool they had great graphics 
running on their projector and kept talking about how cool Cleveland is. 
I got to touch Crystal Method's keyboard ( I was on the left side of the 
stage where unfortunately these two fat asses were making out the whole 
time and pushing me away from the stage)and they played their best shit. 
I especially Liked "Now is the time" and "Trip like I do" they also 
included samples form Keoki's "I can't cope without my dope" which was 
cool. I'd give the show A 9 out of ten. let me know What you guys 
thought about it. -Phreak303-

hmmm, now that i'm finally getting around to reviewing this thing, i'd have=
 to say that i agree with you to a great extent.  i guess if you went to see=
 dj shadow and only dj shadow, i completely understand how you could be=
 disappointed, but i mean hey, there were two other acts on the bill, and as=
 hip hop acts go, they're pretty good ones.  to be honest, i was going=
 almost entirely for shadow, but hey, i like hip hop a lot, especially=
 underground stuff, so i had a good time seeing blackalicious and latyrx=
 anyway. =20

blackalicious - ok, the dj was really pretty much for shit, i mean the guy=
 didn't do anything that i couldn't have done myself to be honest, but hey,=
 he dropped the beats for all their songs and it worked out fine, although=
 he did seem to make some nice "droppiong the needle on the record by=
 accident" kind of sounds every once in awhile.  but anyway, gift of gab was=
 just great...i mean he really put out a lot to be going as heavy and fast=
 as he was for as long as he did...i mean this was one guy mcing the whole=
 time at speeds that not that many mc's get to unless they are REALLY=
 SPITTIN it out.  plus, if you didn't like the beats that they were throwing=
 down, don't blame it on that dj, becuase about HALF of blackalicious's=
 studio tracks have been produced by DJ SHADOW!!  what a treat to hear stuff=
 that shadow hasn't release under his own name.

latyrx - to be honest, i didn't really like the mc's that much...they were=
 ok and all, don't get me wrong, but damn if they didn't seem to just sort=
 of be really like shouting half the time when they should have just been=
 flowing...they were trying to put so much throat into it...expecially=
 lateef...that it was almost like hearing zach de la rocha try to rap.  it=
 just didn't flow, it wasn't the kind of mcing i like.  however the dj was=
 another story...dj marz was fucking tight, he did plenty of good scratching=
 and other assorted tricks, and to be honest i don't even think he was=
 giving a hundred percent.  i could complain that he didn't get into any=
 beat-juggling, but then there were mc's that had to flow over this, so it=
 would've been awful awkward for him to start fucking with the beats that=
 much.  overall though, watch out for that cat, he could probably hold his=
 own in any dj battle.

shadow - all i can say is that it was really just a waste to have a guy with=
 so much talent restrict himself to spinning the intermission music...all he=
 was doing was dropp9ing the standard underground and late 70's funk/hiphop=
 records that you'll here any of the scratch piklz or 1200 hobos play, and=
 he wasn't even doing any worthwhile scratching or juggling, with the=
 exception of giving the first kick drum on each record a jiggajigga to drop=
 it in at the end of the last one, which hardly take a lot of talent.  i=
 asked the guy at the merch counter if he was going to do any of his own=
 stuff live...my words were "is he going to do anything else besides just=
 spin wax tonight?"...and they guy said "well, his name is dj shadow...you=
 know DJ shadow...he's a DJ..you get it?"  and i was like "(thanks fuck face=
 i couldn't have figured that out...) granted he's a dj, but he's also a dj=
 with over two lp's worth of original tracks to his credit!"  i mean what a=
 waste to have someone with so much amazingly refreshing hip hop production=
 under his belt to just spin records between acts.  that's just a waste of=
 his time, and i don't get why he is so into it.  but whatever, to each his =
own.

that's about it...as far as people complaining about the sound...what can i=
 say, i heard the bass and the beats fine, i heard the scratches clear as=
 day, and i heard the vocals just fine too.  i don't see what was wrong with=
 it?  and as far as the space, it's the right kind of space.  granted the=
 beams are annoying, but get over it, at least the turntables weren't up on=
 some stage that's 10-20 feet high so that you can't even see the dj's hands=
 and what the dj is diong with the vinyl and the crossfader, that's what you=
 need to see at a hip hop show.

so some people want a headliner or two and some people just want list
folks ONLY...

why can't we have both?

possible headliners/ex-pb-cle-listmembers include:
dieselboy
deadly buda
187 (ex-list-admin)

i think this would be a good idea, cause:

* we could still have it say that everyone preforming has been a list
member @ some point. 
* any of these names would draw some extra people, too (which would be
a good thing). 
* they are likely to play for just gas money, or whatever small profit
we make from throwing it (if any at all). 

whaddayathinkaboutthat?

also...
andy the pooh, trouty + i were discussing on irc about the fact that
it might be a good idea to meet on irc (as well as bbq's,
get-togethers, and morning after breakfasts) and discuss the rave.
seems like it wouldn't be too hard to set up a time for people to get
on and discuss, and that would really get the ball rollin.

Overall i thought the crystal method was a good show. the crowd was bigger
than i expected, and the vibe was definitely different than any rave. It
kind of bothered me how everyone in the  crowd kept jumping up and down in
sequence. How can people call that dancing. In general I thought the crowd
was pretty fake. Aside from that i had a good time. We arrived late to see
about 45 mins of taylor. I like how they had him spinning of the lower
balcony that was different. I guess the doors were to open at 8 but the tics

said 10 so that messed up the whole schedule. They have a few pics and a
small summary of the show on their web site www.thecrystalmethod.com

peace
ray

p.s. i heard Lunatic Calm didnt perform, maybe i was misinformed.

All good ideas.  I'd vote for 187 especially because of her
exceptional involvement with the list. 

Also don't forget: Farmer Tea and Grrrl 13

Of the ideas currently circulating, I agree with a 'mid' sized event.
Hard to say exactly what that is, but I'd guestimate 200-600 people?

The idea of having a day event is really good.  

I think if we have pb-cle folks only, say have a  BBQ or potluck type
thing around 5 or 6 the day of, set up our stuff, and then have the event
like 10 or 11 to 6 open to whoever.  If we have sound set up, we could
have people who are less confident or just experimental spin from 6-11.

The space issue is important though, and before these details.
Unfortunately, I don't have any good hookups right now.
Anyone else?

I'd be willing to bet that 2 out of the 3 would come for gas money.  You'll have to figure out for yourselves which one I'm saying would not.

I don't think we should stop having little list get-togethers.  I've made
some friends because of them!

Ok.  There's this place.  It's definitely NOT between pb and cle but it's
pretty nifty none the less.  It's called Pancake Skate'n'Whirl.  Yes, it's
a skate rink, but it's not exactly what you think.  The guy has a whole
bunch of ramps and obstacles perfect for skateboarders and bladers.  In
fact, that's exactly what he uses it for.  We talked to him awhile back
about having a rave there and he was up for it.  He wanted half of the
door and he would provide security.  He also offered to make breakfast the
next morning (pancakes)!  The only problem is the residential area
although it's still pretty rural.  It easy to get to.  It has a parking
lot.  There's no smoking inside.  It would definitely accomodate 200-500
people.  Just a thought.

*Brian Steps In*

	Exactly.  Almost.  Instrumental INTELLIGENT hip-hop.  You can't
tell me that what Shadow spun that night sounded anything like the
brilliance that's in his albums.  If you like that "throw ya hands in the
air ladies" stuff...then is was fine.  I think Shadow sold himself short,
he has a lot more talent than that, and I wanted to see it *shrug*.
Again, disappointment.

Oh, sorry.  It's in Washington, PA, a town about 30-40 minutes south of
Pittsburgh.  I70 runs right through it, though.

HELL YEAH!! THat's right in my neck of the woods!!! Would have to allow
re-entry, for the nicotine addicts among us. I don't smoke very much at
parties, though, so I don't really have a problem with that. I think
Washington cops are pretty chill with parties, too. Wasn't it washington
county that underground inc sued a few years ago? Or maybe not... I may have
just made that up. Don't mind me...

I mean no offense to anyone, but in my humble opinion, Crystal Method
gets no props, what so ever.  

I did not see them in Agora, but I did see them in Pittsburgh about a
month ago.  What's up with the crowd they attract?  

For starters, the average age was like 35.  Everyone in the audience
had ONE glowstick and NO one knew how to dance.  It was like
lightsticks were the "hot new accessory for the season."  Each person
tied it on a string and wore it around their necks.  It was like a
five act Shakespearean tragedy.

The trouble is, a shitty vibe has a way of destroying semi-descent
music.

But DJ Shadow is a Hip Hop Dj and producer.  It's just that since he doesn't
have any top 40 hits or have a lot of people Rapping over his beats, people
don't consider him Hip-Hop.  There is a big difference between Rap Music and
Hip Hop.  Hip hop is not just about music it is a whole culture in and of
itself.

Hi Kids,  Some info on the Haunted house tour....i think we could meet at the
parking lot of ARVEY paper and supply.  It is real easy to get to, if you know
where the west end bridge is, coming from the west end circle....you just keep
going straight toward the north side...the road goes right and left but the
parking lot is straight ahead...i would say about 7:30pm on Saturday the 24th
of october..the tours leave every 15min....and the stories you hear will be
unfogetable....post if you are up for going....p.L.u.R...[:0 mark




So far this is who may be going on the tour in Pittsburgh:

MrRab@AOL.com  aka mark
microchipgirl@hotmail.com (Donnell Williams)
andythepooh@hotmail.com (andy the pooh)?
Don the guy that works security at the front door at most raves
NEXT?

<< Hi Kids, are you ready to get scared? In a previous E-mail (listed below) I
 talked about a tour of REAL haunted houses. Well it is that time of year
 again. A guided walking tour of the Allegheny West neighborhood will be held
 on Oct 24th , If anyone is interested going let me know.  We can meet
 somewhere then go on the tour.The cost is $8 or $5 if you are a student
 The tour is called "Spirits of Old Allegheny" 

 (PREVIOUS E-MAIL)
 In reference to your discussion about life after death, I happen to know for
a
 fact that there is an existence after death.  I heard all the ghost stories,
 and stories about angels and sighting of the virgin Mary, but I was
85%certain
 that there is life after death.  The 15% uncertainty bothered me, until I
went
 on a tour of haunted houses on the North side of Pittsburgh, the people at
the
 house said that most of the "ghost" activity revolved around the main stair
 well.  So while the rest of the people looked around the house and antiques I
 focused on the stair well.  Before I knew it something humanoid in shape but
 fuzzy gray in translucent color whisked by at the top of the steps about 15ft
 in front of me.  I didn't say anything at first, but I told my girlfriend a
 little later.  She told me she saw the same thing but she was a bit closer
and
 saw it from a different angle.  To her it looked like a little person or
 child.  After the tour we went back and told the owner of the house what we
 saw and where it was going.  He informed us that he has never seen that
ghost,
 but many guest to his house described the same sighting.  The only difference
 was the other people saw it coming out of a door and going up stairs, we saw
 it going down stair into the door.  Now I am 100% certain that their is
 something after death.  Just because you can't touch it or weigh it or put it
 through scientific study doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Try to touch an ego,
 or happiness, or sorrow, you can't prove they exist either. Any way I was
 straight as a board when I saw this so was my girlfriend.  {:-o Mark

Yeah I always liked his sets.  We used to have a lot of fun spinning
house parties and stuff.  Too bad he doesn't spin anymore.  I'm shure
he'd be down for a PA though.

I think that the party should be in the Spring, only because I am sure there
are alot of students on the list, and if it was during spring, us students
will be able to dedicate more time into the party, and not worrying about
school....plus....the weather will be great, so an outdoor thingy beforehand
would work out great.

i said it before but just for the record my official vote is for a lil pillow
party.  

i like it when i can put my bag down without first having to consider who and
where the suspect thieves are.  

but i'm getting the impression that most of us want to throw a phormish event
- the difference being that *we* threw it.

      so what exactly does the stupid redneck
      population of pittsburgh have to do with
      the music of the crystal method, may i
      ask?

      pearls before swine... :]

      the marketing of the crystal method (and
      every other electronic music act/DJ that CAN
      possibly be marketed this way) ensures that
      the crowd will be not only clueless, but usually
      rather musically ignorant. the crystal method 
      ARE under contract to their label, remember.

      that doesn't mean that the crystal method's
      music isn't amazing. or that $350k worth of
      lighting and sound, combined with albert hoffman's
      accidental discovery, won't completely fry
      your brain...

      let's try to divorce the music from the marketing
      machine. no matter how many prepubescent teenagers
      listen to it, 'keep hope alive' is still one of the
      most beautiful tracks ever produced.

      ok, nuff o' that.

synthvortx@aol.com doesnt like the way i run the rom and says hyperreal is
a joke and is concerned about the state of the rom with the beastie boys
and front 242 listed on it.  comments to trout@hyperreal.org

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events, just testing this out and we'll see what the
reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

Fri Oct 30                      PARTY MONSTER                     Cleveland

We are having a halloween party at Trilogy based on this movie.
We are flying in most of the people that are featured in the film.
For now....
here is SOME  of the info..
PARTY MONSTER...a blood feast
Friday, Oct. 30th   TRILOGY CLEVELAND
performing live.....
SCREAMIN' RACHEL  trax records, chicago
hosting the Hot Body contest...
LARRY TEE  original host of Disco 2000 nyc
In the V.I.P. room....
Ernie Glam and James St. James     original "club kids"
The party will celebrate and recreate the spirit of the original "club
kid" scene.
As it is Halloween, we will also celebrate the "gore" of this heinous
crime. We will be showing the movie throughout the night so people who
haven't seen it, can.    A lot more information about this party is
forthcoming.
This is just a pre-flyer :-)

Sat Oct 31                          GROW                          Cleveland

Price is $0 if you bring Halloween candy.

Price is $0 if you wear a costume.

Price is $0 anyway.

OK, the party's in Avon Lake west of Cleveland.  It's about 30 or so east
from downtown in a barn in the middle of a big field.  The barn has nice
concrete floors, 5 wacky shaped rooms (last party kids said it was like a
giant playland) There's room for tents.  It'll be cold, but if you want
to,
there's a place to set up camp.

Here are the directions from Cleveland...
Take I-90 West to Exit 151 (the Sheffield/Avon exit) and take a right.  Go
2 lights and turn right on Abbe Rd.  Go over the bridge, and its the only
house after it on the left.  It's directly across from the Ford plant. 
You'll see 3 barns there with cars parked all around.  Someone out front
will yell at you to park over there where the rest of the cars are.

Pretty easy, huh?

DJs will remain unannounced, but the music will be good (some hard-ass
techno, some jungle, some speed garage, some live stuff).  It will start
around 10-11.  It is very important to ARRIVE EARLY!  This place will hold
maybe 200-300 dancing kids.  The guy throwing this said that after it's
full, no one else will be able to come in.

No phone number yet either, but I guess all the info you need is here
anyway.  The last party here was Phat Free a couple of months ago...a very
good time.  This one should end up even better!

Sat Nov 28                        ENERGIZE                               DC

U L T R A W O R L D 
in association with
CIRCLE, SONIC SOUL, and 2-TUFF

On Saturday November 28, 1998, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend,
Ultraworld will present the most spectacular event in its 6 year history.
It is called ENERGIZE, and that is exactly what we intend for it to do to
the dance music scene on the East Coast and beyond.  It will be held in
the massive DC Armory, and while we have done 4 events in this space
before, none will compare to the excellence of Energize.

The main arena of this space has a legal capacity of 12,000 in one
wide-open, high-ceilinged, wooden-floored expanse, but what will set
Energize apart from our previous events is that we have now been approved
to use the basement! Don't think basement like dark and dingy though,
this basement has ceilings of 40', and makes the biggest dance clubs on
the East Coast look like efficiency apartments in Manhattan.  Plus it's
divided up into rooms of various sizes. 
For the first time at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all
with full on concert level production in both sound and lighting.  

All performers listed below are confirmed.  The four rooms of Energize
will
be:

The Main Arena:   We will fill this space with the best sound system we
have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of lasers,
projection screens and intelligent lights.  The lineup is one of the best
we have ever presented, a true blend of the most prevalent styles of
electronic dance music.  From hard techno, to trance, to funky breaks, to
fun party music, the main room at Energize is going to be all that and
more.  The performers are:

CARL CRAIG performing live as
Paperclip People  Planet E Records, Detroit
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI  Matsuri Productions  London/Tokyo
DOC MARTIN  Los Angeles
ICEY  Zone, Orlando
SCOTT HENRY  Buzz, DC
T1000  Generator/DJax, Detroit
NIGEL RICHARDS  611 Records, Philadelphia

You may have seen that Uberzone was previously listed in the main room.
They
had said they were available, but then decided to cancel all bookings for
the
rest of the year to make time to write new music. 

The Drum 'n' Bass Arena:  In one of the basement areas, we are proud to
present some of the best U.S. drum 'n' bass talent, along with the
undisputed
champions of the U.K. scene.  This area will be hosted by 2 Tuff
productions
of DC.  The lineup is:

GROOVERIDER  Sony, Prototype, U.K.
FABIO  U.K.
MC GQ  the U.K.'s premier MC
DARA  Breakbeat Science, NYC
DIESELBOY  Platinum, Philadelphia
AK1200  Orlando
DB  Breakbeat Science, NYC
SLANT  2 Tuff, DC
ENTITY  Ultraworld
FLUID  Sonic Soul, Baltimore
MC DUB2  Philadelphia

The Deep House Arena:  This third area, also in the basement, is bigger
then any dance club on the East Coast.  It will be hosted by
Philadelphia's Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long.  The performers are:

DERRICK CARTER  Chicago
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION  Universal Language, U.K.
FEELGOOD  Charm City Records, Baltimore
KENNY GLASGOW  Toronto
O'KEEFE  Circle, Philly
ROB PAINE  Circle, Philly
SEAN THOMAS  Circle, Philly

The Chill Out Arena:  The smallest area of the event, but still bigger
then the main room at most clubs!  This room will be hosted by Baltimore's
respected Sonic Soul crew, and will feature the downtempo side of
electronic music.  You can dance if you want to, with performers:

TIM "LOVE" LEE  Tummy Touch, U.K.
PETE LAWRENCE  the Big Chill, U.K.
WE performing live  Asphodel, NYC
LOVEGROVE  Sonic Soul
DJ C  Toneburst, Boston
RHOMBUS  Sonic Soul

What makes this event even more exciting, is the fact that it will be a
collaborative effort between Ultraworld, Circle, 2Tuff, and Sonic Soul.
While Ultraworld will be the main organizers and provide the direction for
the event, these other three crews will be involved to specifically manage
the areas of music they are most interested in.  What that means for you
is that you get the highest quality of production and care going into
every aspect of the event.

Tickets will be on sale in the DC/Baltimore area on September 30, and
should be at all of the outlets by October 3, and will be broken down as
follows:

There will be 1000 tickets sold for only $20!   So if you know you're
going to go, you have the opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low
price.  We are accepting orders for these tickets now, or you can wait
until they are at the outlets. If you'd like to mail order your ticket,
send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER ONLY, made out to Ultraworld Productions for $20
per ticket ordered.  Send it to:

Ultraworld Productions
3042 O'Donnell St
Baltimore, MD  21224

After those 1000 are gone the price will be $25 up to and including
October 31.  

On November 1st, the admission price goes to $30, and will stay at that
price even the day of the show, at the ticket outlets.  Admission at the
gate will be $35.

will be able to purchase tickets through them.

Also, we are working with the Buzz crew to make this an extended weekend.
For those of you who may not know, Buzz is DC's premier club event, held
every Friday by DJ's Scott Henry and Lieven De Geyndt.  It plays host to
the world's top DJ's and live acts, and the DC scene in general is one of
the best in the country.  When you purchase your ticket to Energize, there
will be a stub which will allow you to come to Buzz on Friday night for
only $5  (Note: Tickets purchased through Ticketmaster will not have this
stub, but Buzz will honor the $5 admission).   Consider coming to DC on
Friday, and making a long stay of it.  We'll post hotel and travel info on
this site in the weeks to come. 

To stay in DC, try these hotels:
Phoenix Park Hotel (closest to venue)	202.638.6900
Best Western (closest to Buzz & afterparty)	202.488.7500
Holiday Inn				202.383.3838
Wyndham Bristol				202.995.6400

Rates are around $90 per night.


When you've had your turkey and you're done with the family, 
the place to be is Washington, D.C. for Ultraworld's ENERGIZE!!!

This is a forwarded message on e testing from another list I subscribe to:



I have learned the test results of several (over 20) different batches of
different logos and I am here to tell you that every single one of them,
(except one capsule tested in Amsterslam which was the real deal), was
MDEA. No MDMA and no bunk shit either.

But MDEA (called Eve back in the late 80s) just ain't the same thing as
MDMA. It makes you feel energetic and good, but not very loving or
empathetic. I hear the complaints all the time.

Its thoroughly fascinating. Since learning the contents of what just about
everyone on the NE coast is consuming, my psychological interest in
consuming that particular substance has completely subsided. By knowing, I
have lost interest. When I have told others of the results I have learned,
I have heard the following comments: "So that's what's been wrong!" "That
makes so much sense!" "Now I understand the problem!" (Ahh, the power of
thought!)

Here's my conclusion and I think its a good one to rely upon: 99 out of 100
times you consume what is called ecstacy on the east coast of the United
States, its going to be MDEA. Its prolly the same on the west coast to, but
I will let them represent for themselves.

CheErs,

Jammin' James E.

Hi Everyone,
        AGAIN!  I write to all of you in hopes to find something........This
time around, I'm asking if anyone works with binaural beats or brainwave
synchronization.  I've been doing alot of work on my own now, and I'd like to
compare or work together with someone on making different types of tones
and/or beats.

Braden --

Thank you for posting this.  I have been saying this for a year now,
yet most people continue to perpetuate that ridiculous "smacky e"
rumor.  One thing, though -- I wouldn't call MDE "energetic" as the
person quoted does, since it's actually the lack of physical energy
that is one of the key characteristics of the chemical.
I get mad that chemists are even making the stuff -- it's just as
illegal as MDMA, and it's *almost* as difficult to make.  I can't
believe people are making the stuff simply because no methylamine
(controlled substanced _required_ in MDMA synthesis) is needed.  It
just doesn't seem like reason enough to jip people out of getting the
good stuff.  (And since methylamine can be purchaed legally in Canada,
I have an even harder time believing this.)  I suppose I may never
figure this out.  The other thing that pisses me off about this whole
"most 'e' pills are MDE" is -- whatever happened to MDA?  God, if it's
slightly easier synthesis you're aiming for, go with that instead --
the stuff lasts 8-12 hours, well worth your money in my opinion.

be reacted to live by an SGI Octane-powered display provided by
Chromacide.

28.8 audio and video stream, approx. four hours long.

alright. let me clarify myself *again*..  i like *some* things that may be hip
hop-esque, however, im not into the whole thing where a dj mixes stuff in the
background and a couple guys jump around rapping real fast so that i cant
understand them and it sounds like crap. maybe i should have said i dont like
*rap*, because thats what it sounded more like to me. i like lauren hill, and
some other things like that that some people would call hip hop, because its
more musical.. its got like, melodies and harmonies and sounds nice.. i dont
know. i just dont like standing around watching some guy rap real fast and
jump around saying "put ya hands up" and shit like that. its boring to me.
<shrug> sorry.

I don't know about the wash. cnty cops or the whole udg suing them
thing, but I DO KNOW that horizon took place there and was
subsequently busted and many dealers were arrested.  You do have to
take in that it was thrown by some shady people (I'm not 100% on that,
but I THINK so).

Also, I like Geoff's idea about the BBQ and then a mid-sized party. 
It would be really neat to see the night transform.

 << Hi Kids, are you ready to get scared? In a previous E-mail (listed below)
I
  talked about a tour of REAL haunted houses. Well it is that time of year
  again. A guided walking tour of the Allegheny West neighborhood will be held
  on Oct 24th , If anyone is interested going let me know.  We can meet
  somewhere then go on the tour.The cost is $8 or $5 if you are a student
  The tour is called "Spirits of Old Allegheny" 
 
  (PREVIOUS E-MAIL)
  In reference to your discussion about life after death, I happen to know for
 a
  fact that there is an existence after death.  I heard all the ghost stories,
  and stories about angels and sighting of the virgin Mary, but I was
 85%certain
  that there is life after death.  The 15% uncertainty bothered me, until I
 went
  on a tour of haunted houses on the North side of Pittsburgh, the people at
 the
  house said that most of the "ghost" activity revolved around the main stair
  well.  So while the rest of the people looked around the house and antiques
I
  focused on the stair well.  Before I knew it something humanoid in shape but
  fuzzy gray in translucent color whisked by at the top of the steps about
15ft
  in front of me.  I didn't say anything at first, but I told my girlfriend a
  little later.  She told me she saw the same thing but she was a bit closer
 and
  saw it from a different angle.  To her it looked like a little person or
  child.  After the tour we went back and told the owner of the house what we
  saw and where it was going.  He informed us that he has never seen that
 ghost,
  but many guest to his house described the same sighting.  The only
difference
  was the other people saw it coming out of a door and going up stairs, we saw
  it going down stair into the door.  Now I am 100% certain that their is
  something after death.  Just because you can't touch it or weigh it or put
it
  through scientific study doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Try to touch an
ego,
  or happiness, or sorrow, you can't prove they exist either. Any way I was
  straight as a board when I saw this so was my girlfriend.  {:-o Mark

Hello all. For any of you planning on attending either the parties in 
Cincy or Dayton this weekend, I feel it is only fair to forewarn you 
that at the present time Cincy is hot. About as hot as Venus. Hotter 
than hell as a matter of fact, because according to Revelations, that's 
hotter than the temperature it takes to melt lead. And since Venus is 
about 900 degress farenheit, if my memory serves me correctly, and the 
temperature necesarry to melt lead is something right around 826 degrees 
or something, we're talking about some pretty high temps here. So, come 
on down, have fun, but be safe. Big brother might be watching.

<3 the kitten

now im not trying to knock shortarm here, but isnt it a bit risky
promoting 2 parties at once? thats what happened to ngl (thats where the
comparison ends, however). im just saying that it seems a bit risky.
what if something terrible happens and lots of money is lost?
i dunno, it seems awfully risky.
they both sound phat though:)

Actually, if we decide to do something in this building I talked about,
we would be willing to set up a pb-cle room or something, and can allow
members in for free, or like a buck or two to cover expenses. let me
know...

This looks like a killer party, but what is up with the times???? It says
it starts at 12noon and goes until midnight the same day. What's up?? And

speak of the devil, the cops that is, I am trying to do a party in y-town
again possibly in november at this enormous building that was left to a
little old lady by her late husband. She really doesn't know what to do
with it, and will possibly let me use it for the night. The space is
80,000 sq. ft, and contains 5 huge rooms. It also has mad parking around
it.  I want to avoid the cop confrontation at all costs, and I called
down to the police department to find out all the laws and regulations.
The first guy I talked to I told it was going to be a rave to see his
reaction, and I explained, dispite the reputation, it's not what it's
been played out to be. Of course I didn't tell him when or where, but he
said no way, not in his city. I then called back and spoke to someone
different, where I proceded to tell him the same thing I told the other
guy, but conveniently left out the word "rave." He said that he didn't
see a problem with this and there were not really any laws against having
an all night dance party, except that fact that it is "illegal" to dance
in youngstown after midnight, and you must have a permit to dance before
midnight.  Tell me this is not bullshit. That is basically how they can
bust up a rave, but really they cannot prove people were dancing. But we
are trying every which way to get the building legal, get the necessary
permits, and try another $5 event to see if we can make it all the way to
the end. But to do this we need a lot of support, and the cops are bound
to show up, but if they have no reason to shut things down and bust
people, then the party keeps going. But I think that it is really lame
and unconstitutional for them to make ubsurd laws to prevent parties, and
if they do bust us, I plan on taking it to court, I have access to a
lawyer, and get this shit changed, it's bullshit. Someone has to stand up
to this bullshit.
  But as for "weird science," we did in august, the cops kept cruising
the parking lot, and I talked to them, and they said that as long as
people were inside, no alcohol was served after 2:30, and noone under 18
was there, they couldn't do shit. But the owner got freaked out because
there were more people there than he had ever seen in his place, and
after we paid him for it, our fault I guess, around 3:45am, he said 5
minutes later that the party is over, and if we didn't shut things down,
he would have his security pull the plugs. So it wasn't the cops it was
the dickhead owner, who I originally thought was alright. But I would be
willing to help out in doing something out here, just say the word, but
those are my dealings...
  oh yea, the one office I talked to the second time called me back 5
minutes later and left a message on my answering machine, here is what it
said...
 "Hey Brian, this is officer Morales. Why didn't you tell me you spoke to
my supervisor?? We could of saved a lot of time. The answer is no, no,
no, no, no. We want no involvement in this....(dramatic pause)....it's a
time bomb."
  I saved this message too, it's fucking crazy. But needless to say, we
are doing it anyway...
peace.

>Damn straight!!!!! Thank you.

actually, it seems like the best way to look at it would be by just giong=
 with the run of the mill definition of hip hop...a culture that revolves=
 around four central elements:

1) MCing
2) DJing
3) B-boying - aka break dancing
4) Graffing - aka grafiti artist, aka writer

now to be honest, it seems like who you talk to about what rapping is will=
 get you a different answer, a lot of what most peole might call rappers=
 would probably be offended if you called them that, they prefer the term=
 MCing...what they think the difference between the two is, i don't know. =
 for the most part i don't see a difference, but maybe that's becuase no one=
 has ever really explained it to me.  but at any rate, if you took rapping=
 to mean MCing, then rapping is one of the four elements that constitutes=
 hip hop as a culture.  so there you go, and now you know.
to argure which element is most important might be considered risky.  it=
 seems to me that you can't really MC or Break dance unless you have a DJ=
 that is spinning some beats for you, but as for writing, i'm not sure how=
 that relates.

The story behind this is located at Ultraworld's web page under the info
section for the venue.  The quick and dirty version is that there is an
ordinance that prohibits things like raves after midnight in the zone, and
following this is conditional to getting the venue.  From reading, the last
two or three events that Ultraworld has had at this venue have been great,
and since there are no windows or whatever people lose track of time and end
up not caring about the daytime setup.  Also Ultraworld really likes the
venue, so goes along with the rules to get it.

1. I would say to ask for the specific city codes that would cover
any type of large gathering of people, etc. You may be able to find 
loopholes, or it may just be badly written. You say you have access
to a lawyer, well have him/her have a look too.

2. It will be on private property. The police can't legally enter
without permission or a search warrant, or if they observe illegal
activity going on. If they do, you would probably have a pretty
good case against them.

3. Is it (the warehouse) in a well-trafficked part of town? Any
chance that they won't figure out what's going on? Is it definitely
in city limits? Will neighbors complain?

4. Don't give in!

Kiker strikes again !!
That warehouse is da bomb. for years we have droolled over
being able to utilize that space. But until a leasor w/ the
proper lease agreement could occupy a portion of the space
to sublet ageement on.... it was going to remain that way.
Actually had forgot about it until this recent occurance brought
it to light again.Brings back some good memories, eh Az?
Of course Fame will do all it can in supporting events in this
venue. (i.e. Magick!)

i know VERY well, what happens when you promote 2 parties at once.  i've
experienced the same problem ngl had in the past myself.

the 2nd party, concept, is comprised almost fully of my friends playing, so
I'm not that worried about the cost aspect of it.  also, we will have all up
front costs for it taken care of before continuum, so i'm not counting on
money from that event to pay for it.  concept will be a much lower key event
than continuum, probably only costing $10

marco carola has been booked SOLID in europe and asia since last april when i
first tried to book him.  he was only available nov. 7th and dec. 19th.  i
tried to have him on nov. 7th, but get freaky 3 felt compelled to do their
event then.  marco is one of my favourite producers, and although very few
"ravers" in the states know who he is, i feel i should have him here whenever
i can.  he is considered by many to be the most technically skilled techno dj
in the business right now.  i figured it would be a nice way to wind down the
year =)

The MW-Raves Weekly Event Calendar
http://www.hyperreal.org/mw/raves/calendar

76 events, 17 new and 8 updated entries
...new look, same great price.

==

It's now a set of lynx-friendly web pages that allow users to:

   o   Get information on the calendar, mailing list or
       submission guidelines

   o   Browse, view, download or e-mail various versions of the
       calendar as hypertext, plain text or PDF

   o   Submit information for upcoming events using
       a form they can fill out online, or by e-mail

   o   Subscribe or unsubscribe to the mailing list

The weekly mailings that go out on the calendar mailing list have
been shortened as a summary.  You get the list of all the names and
dates, but only the upcoming two weeks' worth of e-flyers.  A link
at the top of the file takes you to the website, or the message can
be replied to and an autoresponder at hyperreal will automatically
e-mail you the full-length version.

This new format will not only make more efficient use of resources
but allow more flexibility and ease-of-use for everyone.  Please
check it out and let me know if you have any problems or suggestions.

I'll second this!  I've never heard him DJ, but his records are smooth,
hard, SOLID techno.

Congrats to Shortarm for bringing the best of the current techno DJs to
Cleveland.  Now if you can just get Andrei Morant, Tomito Satori, & Danny
Casseau I'll never have a reason to leave Cleveland again!

I am going to Magick, but with about 8 people, and we are looking to get a
hotel room in Pittsburg.  If anyone from that area could give me a few names
of decent hotels, that are pretty close to Magick, it would be greatly
appreciated.  Also, directions would help too.  Thank you.

Hugh

Amd evidently, same great errors in the URL.  This is like the third week

Hey, sorry this is irrelevant,
but if anyone knows of bands that are
more bass heavy, depressing, mellow,
with a lead singer whose voice is as 
beautiful and perfect as from Portishead,
let me know.

     in actual fact, they never really counted their
     chickens at all. if they had, they would have
     realized that to support events on the scale they
     intended would require not only a large promotional
     network (geographically as well) and _advance_
     promotion. the flyers for d.genesis were done less
     than a month before the party. i don't remember when
     the remix flyers got done because i have repressed
     that memory and need therapy to recall that period
     in my life. jk.

     advance planning is a wonderful thing...

To the person asking about Portishead,
          I'm in the same boat....I LOVE good wholesome, deep, trip hop.  You
might want to check out Massive Attack.  They're Portisheads "rivals" but
they're ok too:-)

I stand corrected; It is Beth Gibbons. I was a bit inebriated last night...
guh... I won't post again under the influence. Beth orton did some of the

Portishead is the is the best hook up album I've EVER encountered. 
There's something about the urgency and passion in her voice that had
a tendency to get everyone in the mood.

I had the pleasure of seeing them live in Manhattan two summers ago. 
They were fucking awesome.  they had this thirty piece string and
brass section with them for back up.  Fantastic mix between a DJ
cutting samples with cellos and violins creating this dark intensity. 
Mad Props to Portishead.

well to start out the place was hard as hell to fi nd! the info line was hard
to hear and the directions were crazy. i never did find anyting about Laurel
Oaks..But we finally got there and found out there was no smoking inside the
air plane hanger because of the gases being used or what ever and that the
girl who was throwing tha party hadnt been there for 2 hours! they said Cappa
was there and all was well. after that i danced for awhile but had 2 slow it
down cause i needed to go smoke, which meant i had to go OUTSIDE!!! it was
kinda cool cause it was right on the runway and you could see and hear the
planes taikin off and all that schtuff. the vibe was great and every1 was real
cool.i couldnt tell you whos sets were good or not because the schedule got
changed so many times that i quit trying to keep track. i did my socializing
and when Cappa Donna came on i rushed the stage he had an awesome set, if you
like WU, a lil while after that we left and thats were the fun comes
in!~~~~~~~

we left cause my buddie wasnt feeling to good welll we were going down 71 and
who else passes us but Capppa in the limo and his peepz 2 cars behind them.
well i was yellin at Cappa from the windows and he rolled his down to! we was
wyeling back and forth for a lil bit but ne way they passed us up well a few
miles down the road we almost hit a 12 point buck head on( a DEER),,,turns out
one of Cappas cru did clip it and we stopped to see if they were cool. we
ended up talking and other stuff till they checked everything out and all was
well Cappa gave me his Yellow WU jacket and told me that if i was ever in town
for one of his shows that he would take care of me! and after that we almost
hit another deer to!
so that my reveiw and story.  a great night good music nice people 2 deer and
a WU!

party on Gabe,,,,,

I've never reviewed b4 so bear with me... 
got there at 1:30 thinkin i would have plenty of time to get in for
the net meet. unfortunately they only had ONE door open checkin ppl as
they went in.. BLAH so around 2:30 or so i finally got through the
door and instantly went to watch 187.. DAMN that girl is fookin great,
had me dancin from just thinkin about her stuff.. after that i just
sorta shuffled between the two rooms tryin to keep an eye out for you
pb-cle'ers but unfortunately i could find no one.. dance, dance,
dance, sit, dance, sit in something wet, dance, eat in that shady
little restaruant deal they had goin down and then finally the drive
home.  I was brought downa  little by the fact that my friend i
brought with me was nursing  killer hangover so she didnt dance much
at al the whole night, she just kept stealng my book bag and passing
out.  I was severely dissapointed i missed the meet, but hey, it
happens.  maybe we can do one Nov 15th at whatever party here in
cincy...

Hey all!
I haven't posted since the beginning of summer.  I was away for a while
prioritizin'  and whut not and now I'm back for more!  To any who do
remember me I used to post from aeiou5@juno.com  Anyway my new addy is
jlp@helicon.net  Feel free to send me assorted sundries and/or
miscellaneous media there.  On to the bizness as it were...
Has anyone been going to Atomic @ Metropol on thurs nights?  I went just
last thursday to hear Dieselboy spin.  WOW! Never saw him live before
but what a ruckus that guy makes.  Before that Product 19 spun (at least
i think it was him!) a mad set. Some other dj's that were too that I
never heard of before.  They were equally svengalies of da riddum in
there own right.  I was very surprised that metropol could look so
neat.  They lowered the lights above the dance floor, made it all ages
(provided for an interesting and diverse crowd), had some wicked
visuals including scenes from video games, anime ("Ghost In The Shell" I
think) and montage footage.  They also had some great lighting in
addition to the regular Metropol junk.  Im not quite sure, but if my
memory serves me well (which is as random as the lottery at best) the
visuals were produced by Electrolyte FX.  Also they brought the DJ down
on the floor, which made me very pleased.  There is nothing quite as
splendid as watching an on point DJ get in there and administer the
groove.  It's so much more visceral and direct than gazing up at
non-descript unrelenting booth in the sky and wondering just where those
beats are comin' from.  My only gripe or complaint is that Dieselboy
came on incredibly late for a club that closes at 2am.  His set did not
start until 1:00am - 1:15am or so.  That compounded with the fact that I
had to leave early (6:30am) in order to put in a day for the man.  Made
his set incredibly short.  Talk about separation anxiety!  It took a lot
of will to pull myself away from those breaks.  At any rate some friends
who left shortly after me confirmed the fact that they shut Dieselboy
down at 2:00am anyway.  Oh well, such is the way of the club.  Aside
from that I had a great time.  A lot of this was partly due to the fact
that I had not been to a party since May's
SUB PHUNC 27 @ the Irish Centre (Hey Viktor!)  Speaking of which
hmm..gee.. I guess I never did meet the infamous Jennifer Rose Weber or
the rest of the pb-cle crew because I missed the net meet there...
P.S. I think DJ DAN is supposed to be spinnin' this next thursday @
Metropol :)

Well take it light y'all.  And hey if ya get the inclination check out
my electronic flotsam at http://www.hhs.net/jlp

Nice To Be Back,
Jon (aeiou)

A friend from NM told me that the kid had done a shitload of acid and
decided he would go climbing like an idiot on these rocks, where a sign
clearly stated  *DANGEROUS* NO CLIMBING!! I feel bad that he had to die.
Legally this woman is not going to be able to do anything. First of all
there was a sign, secondly he is over the age of 18, and thirdly it happened
away from the actual "rave site" How does anyone expect a group of promters
to keep an eye out for 5000 kids? Not to mention kids that aren't even in
the general area, and kids that are freagin 24yrs old. Give me a break...

GrRRrr

No actually i just wanted to see my e-mail address twice in my mailbox :-)

I missed the netmeet. I looked for pb-cle laminates later on when I realized
I had forgot. I did see one list member tho..Lou (circuitryx ) Hi Lou!! Hope
you had a good time!!

Everything was pretty good, until they stopped the music 3 times to give a
list of about 15 cars that needed moved. Who was in the 2nd room when 187
was spinning? I couldn't see shit.  Whoever it was, I liked them alot.

About 4:30 we ( me, Chad and his roomie Jon ) decided were sick of the whole
atmosphere and decided to leave. We had been dancing most of the evening and
finally just wore ourselves out....couldn't dance anymore...didn't want to
sit there...so bed was the option!!

Pe@ce!!

Due to unfortunate circumstances, We have had to change our venue for middle,
columbus' wednesday night weekly dance night.  The new location is a club
called Spring Break(this has to be the stupidest name for a bar ever1!!)  The
bad news is that we now have to charge 3$, but yet we are not makin any more
money.  However the good news is It is right across the street from the old
space.  Here is a tentative line-up for the next few weeks:

10/28
Bob Sfero(middle resident)
Jinx(COlumbus)
Moah Deep(Columbus)

11/4
up in the air

11/11
Lemon Lyman(Middle resident)
Kevy Kev(KG2, Columbus)
???

for those who don't know, Spring Break is on the corner of 11th and high st.
in the heart of the OSU Campus.  any info? e-mail me.

peace,
Jason :*-<

I was been doin' some watching of my television set
last nite, a documentary about mad cow disease.
A really tall kid wearing a Nervous Records t-shirt
was shown trying to walk with the assistance of 
some nurse-like type character or something.
It was sad, he was stumbling about.
Poor people with mad cow disease.
Glad I'm a vege-bro.

Anyways, on the subject of sadness and depression,
I finally hooked up a good tape deck monitor
thing to my box type gadget with a crossfader
(mixer.)
Now many tapes will be made by me.
Hopefully I'll get them out soon.

I can also get a wav. of me doing the deed
on my friend's website.
That way y'all can scope my gruvze.
(For the pb-cle party)

Finally, does anyone know who I can contact
so I can spin at Grow?
They said they'd call me or E-mail me.
They didn't.

You going to a halloween party this weekend???? I might go to Grow or 
Glow, whichever it is, since I'm ten minutes away. But if my friends are 
going to Magick, I will be there. That was way too long and drawn-out 
for no reason whatsoever.

hmmm...meeting someone at a meet.....sounds irrational to me.

I've heard a list of quotes over the last few months that I would like to share!

1) hell no, I don't need no al-co-hal

2) no,no,no,no,  we want no involment with this    (dramatic pause) it's a timebomb

3) This is'nt one of those techno rave things is it ?

4) what you need I.d.! its not even worth it!

5) I just have a lot of friends, OK! I feel insulted.

thats all I can think of for now, each one is representative of a extremly humorous moment in the party scene. Add a few of your own if you want.

It was ok...It was really small though. And I dunno what you thought but the
dj that was mixing when I said hi to you sucked. I know house parties that
have better mixes then that. But other then that it was cool. There was this
one girl at the party that kept on checking me out. She was with her man and
I was with mine. On her way out she walked behind me and was totally feeling
my butt!!! I was shocked. I have never been to a place where everyone is so
open! I thought that was great. Well, Looking forward to something bigger
and better.

Remember the door at the Caffeine Tour?  They did everything but make you
take your socks off?  Well when I emptied my pockets, the meathead
searching me picked up my Vicks Inhaler, turned it over in his hands a
couple of times, squinted at it, then asked me, "So how do you open this
thing?"  

When I opened it for him, he sniffed at it, and I told him, "You better not
get that near your nose if you're going to be working all night."

I've heard a list of quotes over the last few months that I would like to
share!

1) hell no, I don't need no al-co-hal

2) no,no,no,no,  we want no involment with this    (dramatic pause) it's a
timebomb

3) This is'nt one of those techno rave things is it ?

4) what you need I.d.! its not even worth it!

5) I just have a lot of friends, OK! I feel insulted.

thats all I can think of for now, each one is representative of a extremly
humorous moment in the party scene. Add a few of your own if you want.

I just made a 50 min. mix tape,
and I could've kept going.
No train wrecks, cuz I never do that.
I'll start sending them out to all
those who are waiting, I have your addresses!

Hopefully I'll get it up on the web this week.

bring a basketball jersey and a basketball and be one of those really
tall basketball players... maybe find out who's the tallest one that's
white and buy his jersey?

or better yet, say you are a midget, and you are being a really tall
guy for halloween!

regardless, bring a basketball cause that seems like it would be a fun
thing to play with on the dancefloor :)

Well...I missed the updated post of the net-meet for Channel Jive, so 
yet again I missed out. Foiled again! Regardless, lemme say it was quite 
an honor to finally meet andy the pooh. Quite a pleasure. 

I had a good time at Channel Jive...it didn't hurt that I had a good 
degree of access to restricted areas, and that I finally got to meet 
Terry Mullen...that was nice. TOo bad I couldn't see *anyone* else at 
the party...I couldn't see two feet in front of my face. It was a good 
time though. Bummer about those fire marshal interruptions. 

I'm now looking forward to Navigate. Can't wait to see Jason again and I 
am really looking forward to hering Dara spin again. I went to "The Best 
Party" Friday, and caught him for the first time. Lemme just say, it was 
teh most beautiful dark jungle set I have EVER heard. Mighty impressed. 
It was too bad that party didn't go over better than it did. The space 
was good, minus the no-smoking lest we go up in flames thing, and there 
was some really good sets that went on. I'm hoping to try and get a copy 
of dara's set from that night...I think they recorded at that party.

Regardless, sorry I missed you all again. If anyone's planning to attend 
Navigate in COlumbus Nov. 14th, then maybe we can hook up there.

Hmmm...never heard of this before.  Where is this - in oakland?  
This plus ON starting up as well as Atomic runnin....that's a pretty
decent selection of dance-oriented nights.  Then there's NATO for the
downtempo stylings (hopefully still going on).

Now where's our hardcore and experimental nights coming in..???
I'd be into doing one if it could be hooked up, but i definitely don't
think it would be profitable....

Atomic was neat last thurs when dieselboy was spinnin.  I had not heard
about On or the thing on fifth.  Does anyone know if NATO is still goin
on?  I hope so too.  I remeber seein' Geoff spin a wicked Gabber set dere
and whut not (Hi Geoff, remember me).  I saw Edgar Ummmm there a couple of
times too.  He has many neat-o records.   I would love to see some more
experimental stuff goin' on too.  As a matter of fact I would love to be
included in that.  I'd be interested.  But unfortunately Geoff, I don't
think it would swing the phat ducs either.  Well viva experimental us po'
broke fools!   Take it light all.

i don't know if one of the other pb-clevers who x-list to pgh-goth-list or the
following list posted this yet, but here is some information about a new list
for experimental and noyzey beats in the 412.  compared to the crap you kids
post - i still love yall hehe - it's very worthwhile (i've gotten i think
three posts since i subbed a week ago) and compared to the blabbermouthed
retards on pgh-goth it's totally silent.  the listadmin said she's looking for
new members so go ahead and make that call.

boom, boom, chachacha

okie gothies, 

i have been asked by several ppl over the past week to post
this information again, and of course i cant remember specifically who
they were, except that they heard about it on the gothlist.

here is the information about the millvale industrial theater list:

this list has been created for the announcement and discussion of
independent, underground and experimental music events in Pittsburgh
including but not limited to the genres of indie rock, avant-jazz,
noise/avant-garde, gothic/industrial, punk/garage, ska/reggae/dub,
hip-hop, alterna-country, and electronica/techno/drum&bass. 

Activity will center around events involving the Millvale Industrial
Theater (hence the list name) but are also welcome to involve any other
venues that encourage any type of DIY music, including the following: CMU
Activities Board, Chatham REA House, The Move Studio, Rickety/Turmoil
Room, 31st St Pub, Next Decade, Laga, University of Pittsburgh
auditoriums, and so on.

My mom said today...

"Why don't you stop hanging out with those weird raver kids and hang out 
with some nice OSU kids"

"Don't do any of those halogens at the rave"
-she meant hallucinogens



Live life with no regrets.....

Oh gawd, Caffeine was my first party ever. I was so turned off to the 
scene at first. I don't know, I didn't really know what to expect.  I 
gave it another shot, though, at Phreak Show and as soon as I got in 
line at the door, I saw an old friend from high school. That was totally 
cool. Then I saw another old friend from school, then another. I had a 
blast and now I can't stay away from all the new people I've met. Now 
I'm blabbling. blah blibber. I'm bored that's why. And I want to talk to 
somebody, but I don't know who. Anyone really. I had the most horrible 
weekend of my entire life. It changed me, probably for the worst, 
forever. ahhhhahahahah. I should stop thinking altogether. It only seems 
to kill me - make me depressed. For now on I'll just be a vegetable. if

x @ 1604 fifth ave 2nd floor (map on flyer seems to indicate uptown, by the
arena, duquesne u., + mercy hospital).  7up and product 19 were supposed to do
the opening on friday, according to the flyer; nobody seems to know if this
rilly happened or if it's a weekly event.  invitations, oddly enough, were
placed in study carrels at hillman (the main library) of the university of
pittsburgh.

nato @ sip cafe (ellsworth + spahr streets in shadyside).  i'm pretty sure
this is still going on cos i got a groovy color flyer for it at hypervinyl
just a week ago, also i see nato resident dj ed umm there occasionally
(hypervinyl), altho he may be buying records for his other job at zythos.  i
walk there when i don't have a ride or there's nothing "better" to do on
friday nights.  (sorry if that sounds mean - i rilly do like it there ...)
byob and chill out with friends, but don't expect to meet lots of new people.

yay, the stillers just silled the vee on monday night football.  <high five,

i should have taken housekitty more seriously when she was talking about how
hot it's been in ohio.  STEAMING.  

the local fire marshalls were caring enough to stop by in their white stretch
limos several times (no joke).  okay, i know that sometimes law enforcement
intervention is just ... suck ... (probably something about maximum occupancy
and fire hazards, and that's why they couldn't let anyone in) but the way
bounce theory dealt with it infuriates me.  i'm talking about the door policy:
separate lines for boys and girls.  what kind of bullshit is that?  there were
no signs, no announcements, no answers.  no discount on admission.  i ended up
spending 110 minutes in line - no exaggeration.  also, a lot of kids were
cutting ...

so you've probably never heard me make a negative comment before.  i don't do
it often.  i guess i kind of am bitching, but it's more just to make you all
aware of what happened to me, so that you all can watch out for yourselves,
and also so that maybe they can try to justify themselves.

i had a fantastic time at channel jive, so it all worked out :) it was so not
crowded inside!  and not even that hot!  i still had to take of my shirt but
it wasn't like a sauna.  two fairly large rooms, both with pumpen bass, and
hellza smiles n hugs n hand-holden, oh and there was a back room with like
pool tables and video games.  a lot of parties have a room like this but this
one made me feel like i was in youth group bible study at the ymca or
something.  the other rooms were wet and dirty - bathrooms of course had piss
puddles - so the cuddle bunnies had to pet each other in there, where it was
realllly bright.  except for my kids :) we know partying is dirty bizness.

i just thot of another quote:
"was it a RAVE?!!??"
- my friend ariel, who made horrified faces while hearing about my weekend

oh and another one!
friend whose house i went to next morning: you mean people were doing DRUGS
there?!!??
me:   i swear i didn't know it was going to be that kind of party!!!!!

that's all for now ... peace

Yep.  
Tom is quite zany, now I'm questioning
my own sanity after reading his posts.

And I know I am not a hug type person,
but if I was Kerri, I'd hug myself.
Then I'd touch my boobs cuz I'm a guy at heart.
Anyway, poor Kerri.  Feel better.  That is an order.
Hang in there.

Damn my irrelevance.
Now I feel useless.

close, but my favorite i heard just yesterday (sorry pinkwiggirl)
owner of possible venue "So, what is it that attracts you young people
to this type of thing?"
pinkwiggirl "It's a great alternative to the bar scene.  A place you can
go where everyone isn't drunk.  You can dance and eat candy all night."
maybe you had to be there, hahahhaha

hey i'm going to majick too. and i'll probably be at darkside 6 too,
although i'm going to have to really book it straight there out of
work since i'm supposed to be done at 10:15. i didn't even know there
was going to be another darkside until i got the flyer fri. i feel so
out of touch. :o anyway (exclusive listmember clue!) if you see a bank
robber in camo pants + stocking cap with a pantyhose on its face
(until it gets really hot at least), that's me.

this is not totally rave related but it's funny. yesterday i
was at the grocery store (finast) and i saw this sign in front of the whipped cream, that said "shop to stop drugs." =] but i swear i bought whipped cream only for pumpkin pie. although i don't shop to stop drugs.

this is not rave related but computer related. the mouse on this computer died, so i bought a new one, a cheap "mouse systems" one from sun tv, where if you ask the only salesperson in the store a question, they don't even bother to look up from the video game they're playing (this acually happened!). so the new mouse worked but then it broke after a couple weeks. i sent it back and they sent me one that looks like it's been pried open slightly and that locking ring on the bottom is missing. i reinstalled everything and changed the mouse settings and now the pointer moves only up + down and clicks nonstop. the enclosed form letter begins "dear value customer" and warranty is spelled "warrenty". =O this has got to be the most ghettofied company. so i'm just letting you guys know what might happen if you buy a mouse systems mouse. and don't even go to sun tv. they're going out of business anyway. what a surprise!

      as well you should. i'm not quite sure you should

      the insanity spreads like wildfire.

      speaking of which, there was a green pygmy elephant
      pissing on the floor in the elevator as i was coming

guess who's back ;P~

k, for all u porn fans here's my new e-mail addy:
steviet69@netscape.net

why 69?...it's not 216...it's not 614...it's a porn thing...
it's symbolism for pisces (my astrological sign) and for yin =

& yang (an asian thang)...plus yin & yang symbolizes the equal =

& opposite forces of light & darkness...one can not survive =

without the other...i could go on, but i'll start getting real =

deep...

why netscape?...i was going to use my work's e-mail addy
(steve@noritech.com, but my boss has access to all my e-mail
(which may not be a good thing)...plus netscape is free,
including free web pages & also has the aol instant messaging
feature, which i'm going to have to figure out how to use
next...

---

oh yah, if anyone saw a tall lanky asian dude @ Infectious
in cleveland this past weekend w/ a fly ass girlie in a white
long sleeve split t-shirt & a black dude dancin all funky w/
a spoon hangin out of his mouth, or a li'l breaker girl w/
a porn star hat on in the circle, that was me, mia (jamie),
spoony (mark), & my roomie nicole...we decided to hit cleveland
last second to promo Navigate...and i needed to talk to some
cleveland promotors about FA5...

Here's a thought....... I was thinking we could have a pb-cle house
party for organizing and brain-storming for the party and for the list
DJs to spin. If anyone's interested, just let me know. I'll have to talk
to my boy Byron.(you may have met him at Liquid during the net-meet).
It'd be at the Liquid after-party house (Byron's) that everyone was
invited to during that net-meet. BTW..this is in Cleveland. If I get
enough response, we could do this in a couple of weeks. I'm thinkin'
maybe a Friday. Let's start chattin' about this one kidz..........

sup everybody?

this is a reminder that the MAD PROFESSOR (and the robotiks band) are
gonna be playing @ rosebud @ 9:00 (doors @ 6).

in case you don't know, he just about as famous as a dub musician can
get. i'm sure it'll be a wikked wikked show. chill dubalicious
grooves... if there's ever been a reason for it to be 4:20, the mad
professor concert is it :) 

$12 well spent

it's 21+, so if you'ze a youngin like me, you gotta get a
parent/guardian to come with you.

Are you kidding me ? all these creative minds pooled together in one place and the best I get is frankenstein and the green giant ? YEA RIGHT!!! like I don't hear those jokes fifty times a day! followed by the standard "how's the air up there" or "how's the wheather up there" (I always spit on this person and say , "its raining"!) as for the basketball player thing, I have been doing that for like 8 years! thats no fun for me! YSU WOO HOO!!!! (gag) The giant penis idea was good, but it could turn me into a homophobic. I would like to come as the invisible man, so if you don't see anybody, it could be me! although, a good dose of the right drug could make me believe I am invisible, among other things. Better yet, I will be a giant candy raver eating monster, to avoid this possible tragedy, give me better ideas!!!!!!

Housekitten,"Oh, is Kelly here?"
pooh,"umm, i don't think so. I'm hoping she'll show up at some point."
Housekitten,"oh, i've never met her, but i have been talking to her               
through e-mail."
pooh,"Oh, are you on the list?"
housekitten,"yea, i'm housekitten. Who are you?"
pooh,"OH MY GOD!! HOUSEKITTEN!! I'm andy the pooh"

before. oh well. I hope you had a good time housekitten, and i was soo

for some reason, i really hate all of these posts of who is and isn't going to
make it to a net meet only to read the review of the party and find that the
meet never happened, or it did happen, but only a few people's names were
remembered. why can't one post be made of the time and location of the meet
and go from there. if there is someone on the list that you want to see at the
meet, just email that person. 
or, make a final compilation of names and post it the afternoon of the party.
i don't see the need to repost the list everytime a new name is added.
god. i'm in a really bad mood tonight. but since i'm at it, what happened to
all of the intelligent people who belong to this list? i used to actually
learn something from this pb-cle raves. it seems now that it's just a means to
gossip. i should take that back, i still look forward to posts from amanda,
jennifer, kelly, and a couple others i might have missed, but it seems that
the number of posts that i read from them gets smaller and smaller every week.
i really am in a horrid mood. sorry kids. i'll try to smile tomorrow.

What is up with this chick??? Not the one posting to trouty but the one
who is dissing everyone on the list? Hey it seems to me that the obvious
answer to the problem of you having to read shit you don't wanna read, is
un-sub-scribe to the damn list. What I do if there is something I don't
feel like reading, I look at the subject, then hit delete. But there is
always something that catches my attention, like your posts. That was
probably your intention, to catch someones attention, but if you have a
problem with people not bringing up intelligent topics, then maybe post
something that interests you and wait for the replies.  Or are you the
one that is lacking in the areas of intelligence that you are unable the
bring up a new topic??? Sorry I had to respond to this, but don't call
people idiots, it just makes you more of one.
peace.

These are some great quotes that I heard at the last party I was at....

"yo man, are you lookin' for any e?"
"yo man, you know where I can get some rolls?"
"yo man, are you lookin' for any crystal?"
"yo man, you know where I can score some meth?"
"yo man, you know where I can find a rehab clinic?" - from the yo man's
friend.
  I don't know why everyone thinks my name is "yoman."

"hang ten, surfer boy!!!" my new favorite quote.

i really am sorry for all of the mean and uncalled-for posts earlier. i was
having a bad night and i guess i took my frustration out on the list. i'm
generally a nice person. i'm sorry again. i don't know what i was thinking,
honestly.
please disregard all of my cranky posts.

<< What is up with this chick??? Not the one posting to trouty but the one
 who is dissing everyone on the list? Hey it seems to me that the obvious
 answer to the problem of you having to read shit you don't wanna read, is
 un-sub-scribe to the damn list. What I do if there is something I don't
 feel like reading, I look at the subject, then hit delete. But there is
 always something that catches my attention, like your posts. That was
 probably your intention, to catch someones attention, but if you have a
 problem with people not bringing up intelligent topics, then maybe post
 something that interests you and wait for the replies.  Or are you the
 one that is lacking in the areas of intelligence that you are unable the
 bring up a new topic??? Sorry I had to respond to this, but don't call
 people idiots, it just makes you more of one.
 peace.

This is a new, very malicious virus and not many people

No idea how much the Spawntaneous party will be...(I know it's Halloween,
but calling a party Suicide just doesn't make me wanna go no matter what
time of year)...but Grow is free.  All the details (including directions to
the site) are in the R.O.M.  ***Make sure you come early, though***  After
the barn fills up, no one else will be let in.

This isn't. There is no such thing as an email virus. Email is
text only, and therefore incapable of doing anything to your computer.
Attachments, however, can be malicious. Just don't execute anything
that strange people send you and you won't have a problem. 

How is it that I have been on the internet for like 6 years and have
still managed to not get a single virus?

anyway, I went down there with a couple of the other cmu rave kids and
was quite pleased that I did. tight tight set from tr gen. and product
19 was just starting to tear it up when we left (my evil 8:30 class...)
not too many people there, but hopefully things will pick up as more
people hear about the night...

Mark (MrRab@aol.com) has been handing out pb-cle laminates at the net
meets over the past couple of months.  This discount is for those who've
been involved in the meets.  Anyone who can get one by Sat will get the
discount.  I'm doing this in hopes that other promoters will start
offering discounts for those with the pb-cle laminate and therefore more
people will join the list.  It's also nice at parties to see people
wearing the laminates.  That way you can introduce yourself to others on
the list.

"CyberBuddah's Malevolent Throbbing Pooglefest"?

Ah well.  All i know about it is the b/w flyer they were handing out
and Craig K is involved in some capacity.  And its local djs/acts.
I had a final and no ride last night, but I'll definitely check it out
in two weeks....

BTW:  who's at SCJ next week? anyone know?

 Its good in the respect that I only have to wear it for a few weeks,
but unfortunately Magik falls within the few week period:(  So, if I
went, It suck cause I wouldnt be able to dance.  Hopefully, I'll be eh
ok for Dawn.  Even if I'm not I'm still goin tho. Everyone thats goin
to Magik, have a great time, and think of me when your listening to an
extremely bomb track and gettin down!  Have a great time and hopefully
I see all you kids at Dawn.  I wouldnt miss that party for the world!

Peace,
Josh

Gosh Channal Jive was awesome.  But to me the vibe really made it 
happen.  I really enjoyed running around with a few different people 
like a little kids holding hands and skipping.  I loved gettting various 
back rubs from agh...... alot of different people.  I love chatting and 
meeting.  I wish I didn't miss the meet but we left too late to arrive 
that early.  Thank you guys for really making the party.  I do believe 
it was the people at this party.  Since some things tried to ruin it(the 
fire people, the police at the end).  It didn't bother me.  I got pushed 
off the stage to talk to jordana(187).  Oh well....I had too much of a 
good time.


Too bad i am utterly addicted to the scene I can not miss parties 
anymore.  MOney(its for college yet I use it)  but why would i want to 
think of the future?  Gosh, I just am in "ravah heaven".  I really 
really really reallly really.....should i say it again really
CAn't wait until Majick where I get to see you list kids and see my 
b-friends from home.  I am too too excited for words to tell.

So see you all there and peace to ya

PLUR
SMOOCHES  and hugs

from
bEnny

quick review on the mad professor gig...

there was an opening band called freedom that was alright... reggae,
local, nuff said.

mad professor was runnin what the mc kept calling a "live dub studio
session", with a mixing board and some sampling equiptment. it looked
like he was running some of stuff of VCR tapes... i dont know how that
worked but they kept loading them into a machine. mad professor would
bring in and take out parts, put echoes and reverb, and just generally
tweak out the soundz. it was pretty nice. the mc was cool... he wasn't
too happy that the crowd was SUPER WHACK! 

anyways, he started off with some excellent vocal tracks... very new
skool roots music/dub. top notch. soon after  he rinsed it out with
some breakbeats... dubjungle that was too tight! nice dub breakdowns
and before you knew it, he'd throw in a breakbeat and switch it up on
you. sounded nice + hardsteppy, but definietly with a trademark mad
professor feel. the rest of the nite was roots + dub, and was all nice
and chill and danceable (but you had to be dancin s-l-o-w :)

hmmm... ok - that's it. sorry you guys didn't make it out cause it was
a lot of fun.

magick is the day after the day after tomorrow! i hope yer costumes
are ready!

see you @ the pumpkin carving if i make it.

This is just a quick observation, but I noticed 
that there are quite a few list members who are rather
touchy about the "quality" of the postings here.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME ? its not that big a deal! delete
the stuff that looks meaningless! Besides its not
quality that counts, its QUANITY BABY!! WOO_HOO!

So, I stopped buying fashion magazines (Elle, Vogue, um, Seventeen) when I
graduated high school.  I decided they were bad for my self-image and
stupid besides.  However, they ARE guilty pleasure of mine.  I recently
bought "Tatler", an British fashion rag in which I found the following.

"Is there life after combat trousers? Top buyers predict an action-packed
season"

(excerpt)

'Fat pants.  Wide flared pants that almost look like a sarong or skirt.'
	- Rita Britton, owner, Pollyanna, Barnsley

hmmmm, I suppose we're now the talk of the runway....at least in England.

Please specify if you want a laminate or sticker....i can only give out one

Well, I might be the only one who is staying in Cleveland on Saturday for
Spawntaneous' "Another Suicide", but I wanted to put in a word of support
for it. I went to their "Suicide" on Halloween in 1996 and had one of the
best times of my life!  In fact, the whole "604"/"Goa" thing started at
that party (it was at USA Skates.  During someone's trance set, I saw the
numbers 604 on a mailbag used for collecting towels or something and for a
second I thought it said "Goa".  For those who don't know the music, Goa
Trance is another term for psychedelic trance.  Anyway, I posted this to
the international Goa Trance list and it caught on.  Now the list is even
called "604" instead of "Goa" -- all this from the first "Suicide" party.)

So, since I'm going, I decided to start a net meet list.  Please email me
if you're also going or even just thinking about attending.

Sincerely,

Braden

okay, i have to say that i really didn't like this party very much.  I
have (as those of you who really  know me) been in an anti-party funk as
it is, and this just did not help.  I can't say that the party was awful,
i did have some fun, but there was no vibe there at all.  Just bored
overly fucked up cracked out kidz wandering from one dirty room to the
other like pavlov's dogs.  *ding* switch rooms and drool for something
that wont happen.  I dunno.  I am just starting to wonder what everything
is comming down to anymore.  No one seems to enjoy what it is that we have
and no one seems to understand that there is more to a party then just
getting extremely fucked up.  Yes, i know that i am mr. sober raver, and
yes this does seem a rather biased opinion, but when i go to metropol and
people are there for a total of three hours all of which are spent trying
to find drugz, it makes me a little ill.  Recreational use of stuff is
fine, hell i do it, but when it supercedes the ideology and the point of
what we are doing, then it becomes cancerous, a cancer which is spreading
further and further. Bah. what ever.  I must have lost my plur or
something ... 

whoops...bit of a digression there...anyway, the music was good, Frankie
Bones sounded great from outside where we were in line for a good two
hours.  (bit of an exageration i guess) and 187 was great, except the
system couldnt' handle her shit, and was all fucked up and distorted.
Terry Mullen was the saviour of the party though. I must say that man
kicked my ass from one side of the room to the other and then back around
again.  The space was just nasty...i have never been that dirty after a
party (except after Digital Genesis) and the bathrooms were foul.  Oh and
i should say that $25  to go sit in a grungy hell hole and hear some okay
music and then get kicked out at 7:00 am is a bit rediculous. There, that
is my review.  Some of you have already been warned, to the rest of you ,
i apologize, but we really need to start supporting the true elements of
the scene, not the fucked up bullshit which is seeping into everything.  

this is all

For anyone considering going to this 'party'
I would suggest checking out the pb-cle list archives for November 96.
There are plenty of
reviews of the first Suicide.  Spawntaneous is responsible for many of my
worst rave experiences.  Majick is being thrown by two VERY positive OLD
SCHOOL ravers.   Don't take my word for it, read the reviews and make up
your own mind.  It shouldn't be a very tough call.

That's not an exaggeration. I waited for an hour and a half.

I haven't reviewed this party, because I really wasn't sure how I felt about
it. I had a good time, but that was ONLY because I thought the people were
really nice. Cracked out, but still nice. It's not the drug, it's the
person. I firmly believe that. It was badly organized, the authorities were
assholes, and the music was so-so over all.
One good thing: My friend lost her wallet on the dance floor. A boy found it
and pretty much searched the whole party to find her and gave it back,
nothing missing... Pretty cool, huh?
I think that may have made the night for me.
Love,
Amber

I hear ya.  I do this thing where every weekend before a party I get
really, really excited and worked up at the prospect of going out and
having a blast ... and then I end up disappointed more often than not.
 Channel Jive was very disappointing -- I thought the music, while it
was fine, could have been better -- more energetic I guess.  I didn't
dance much because the place was so stuffy (this is another problem I
have -- temperature control.)  Oh, and one time when I was resting
quietly on the floor some kid ran up to me and screamed "Crystal?!!!"
right in my ear.  Uh, do I look like I really want some of that?  I
probably looked like I really wanted my bed, so maybe he thought he
was helping me out. *shrug*  

So, now I'm awaiting Magick, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

--Amanda

No need for a net-meet list on this one.  It's looking like the party'll
end up being half net kids anyway.

Same reason I've been having sex for like 6 years (and then some) and have
still managed not to get a single virus.  You just gotta be careful.

okay, i have to say that i really didn't like this party very much.  I
have (as those of you who really  know me) been in an anti-party funk as
it is, and this just did not help.  I can't say that the party was awful,
i did have some fun, but there was no vibe there at all.  Just bored
overly fucked up cracked out kidz wandering from one dirty room to the
other like pavlov's dogs.  *ding* switch rooms and drool for something
that wont happen.  I dunno.  I am just starting to wonder what everything
is comming down to anymore.  No one seems to enjoy what it is that we have
and no one seems to understand that there is more to a party then just
getting extremely fucked up.  Yes, i know that i am mr. sober raver, and
yes this does seem a rather biased opinion, but when i go to metropol and
people are there for a total of three hours all of which are spent trying
to find drugz, it makes me a little ill.  Recreational use of stuff is
fine, hell i do it, but when it supercedes the ideology and the point of
what we are doing, then it becomes cancerous, a cancer which is spreading
further and further. Bah. what ever.  I must have lost my plur or
something ... 

whoops...bit of a digression there...anyway, the music was good, Frankie
Bones sounded great from outside where we were in line for a good two
hours.  (bit of an exageration i guess) and 187 was great, except the
system couldnt' handle her shit, and was all fucked up and distorted.
Terry Mullen was the saviour of the party though. I must say that man
kicked my ass from one side of the room to the other and then back around
again.  The space was just nasty...i have never been that dirty after a
party (except after Digital Genesis) and the bathrooms were foul.  Oh and
i should say that $25  to go sit in a grungy hell hole and hear some okay
music and then get kicked out at 7:00 am is a bit rediculous. There, that
is my review.  Some of you have already been warned, to the rest of you ,
i apologize, but we really need to start supporting the true elements of
the scene, not the fucked up bullshit which is seeping into everything.  

this is all

 reviews of the first Suicide.  Spawntaneous is responsible for many of my
 worst rave experiences.  Majick is being thrown by two VERY positive OLD
 SCHOOL ravers.   Don't take my word for it, read the reviews and make up
 your own mind.  It shouldn't be a very tough call.
  >>



i must agree with this. i would strongly reconsider going to this spawntaneous
event.
<shrug> perhaps it's more for personal reasons, but i will never go to another
spawntaneous party. yay for magick. yuck for another suicide. just the name of
the party in itself would make me want to stay home.

> I have (as those of you who really  know me) been in an anti-party funk

Yeah, I know what ya mean.  You go and stand around for a couple of hours, geek on
the lights get into the music, but ya just ain't feelin' it.  Depressing really.
Most of the time I find out usually that my boredom is many times due to my
alienation as it were.  Halloween will be my Raver Birthday #1.  And I've been
going to parties, for the most part, alone.  It seems like it would be a lot more
fun if I had a whole crew to roll (locomotion not da chemical) out with.  But the
people that have gone out with me a) don't get it, or b) try, but leave early or c)
don't dance.  Don't get me wrong, most of the time I'm completely cool with
groovin' by my lonesome ( I usually end up dancing myself into some sort of
oblivious dervish-like state by the end of the night anyway).  It's just that
sometimes I would be a lot more enthusiastic if I had someone to share it with.
So I guess I'm just sayin' in a long and self indulgent way that "I know the
feelin"

No one seems to enjoy what it is that we have
and no one seems to understand that there is more to a party then just
getting extremely fucked up.  Yes, i know that i am mr. sober raver, and
yes this does seem a rather biased opinion, but when i go to metropol and
people are there for a total of three hours all of which are spent trying
to find drugz, it makes me a little ill

Yeah me too brotha..lemme tellya.  There is more to a party than turnin' your brain
into play-dough, no doubt.  You are not alone in that opinion.  I can honestly say
that I've never been under the influence at a party (with the exception of the
occasional drink at metropol if that counts).  Maybe it's just that I usually have
to drive very far to get home from these things but more so I think it's the fact
that if I were wasted I'd lose what to me is the most rewarding "high" that is the
holistic, sense of super awareness I get from adrenaline rush upon rush.  If I
dance non stop, only pausing for water, I get the most intense, natural, positive,
sublime rush.  I'm not like all D.A.R.E. anti-substance and all. Moderation is
key.  But when it comes to parties, I usually don't have time to think about drugz
'cause I'm usually out on the floor.

Recreational use of stuff is
fine, hell i do it, but when it supercedes the ideology and the point of
what we are doing, then it becomes cancerous, a cancer which is spreading
further and further. Bah. what ever.  I must have lost my plur or
something ...

Nah, I don't think ya dropped yo plur.  I think your just feeling the tug of the
"r" in plur.  What it seems your getting at is respect.  Not only for the
envirionment/atmosphere but for yourself and what others worked so hard to
create.   It's hard to feel a solid groove when ya got vanilla ice in your ear
every ten minutes tellin ya he "got rolls" (like they're some kinda late night
pastry chef or some shit).  And like I said what people do is there business but
damn for the love of the forgotten art of tact and grace use some bloody
discretion!  On top of that if theeze pusher kidz don't learn to keep their game a
little bit tighter and on the downandlow tip they're gonna destroy nearly 20 years
of subculture.  So I guess I'd like to see a little bit more respect for the
originators, creators, dj's, on the level promoters, artists and brothas and sistas
who spent all this time dodging building zone ordinances and disturbing the peace
laws just to provide me and you with an alternative to the "rec center" or
poolhall. We are part of one of the most interesting mediums for innovation in
music and effective info distribution networks in counter culture history (also one
of the most positively spirited subcultures).  I guess I feel that there is a
lacking of unity and brother/sisterhood. It seems as though this once existed, the
tribalism and the ecstasy (again not the chemical), but I think we have a chance
and I don't want to see these possibilities fade.

Hey all, I'm sorry.  I know something similar usually gets posted once a month.  I
don't post that often so maybe it was just building up. I guess I just wanted to
cast my vote in support of that sentiment.

Take it light,
Much respect,
-jon

English ravers dress nothing like american ravers. They all look like 
Sporty Spice. Addidas break-aways, shoes, and shirts. Maybe they're 
changing the style a bit now. I like their style better. I'm not a phat 
pant gal myself. You guys look cool in them, though.

It sounds as if he had an A-dat machine.  I used to use them when i was doin

Hmmm...
Desert raves do sound like they would be
fun.  But wherever there is a rave, there
is destruction.
(My car has been raved in!)

I don't know about ruining habitats and stuff.
If ya wanna party in the desert, take your
radio to the sandbox.

I plan on taking a trash bag with me 
for future parties.

	Leave it how you found it.

Sorry, but I can't reach Kerri any other way.

Well, if you wanted to go to Majick and have friends 
going, then you don't have to Grow it.
I just don't want to be responsible
if you start to have regrets.

But I'm gonna have a blast!  Woo hoo!!!

P.S.- I only spin about 4 or 5 Chicago house tracks.
Mostly DJ Sneak (Blue Funk Files and You Can't Hide From your Bud.)
I'll get you a free mix tape too, but it'll probably
be just like my set, if I get to play.
(Except side B has Techno and booty house.)

If I do, I'll let you know.

synthvortx@aol.com doesnt like the way i run the rom and says hyperreal is
a joke and is concerned about the state of the rom with the beastie boys
and front 242 listed on it.  comments to trout@hyperreal.org

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events, just testing this out and we'll see what the
reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

Fri Oct 30                      PARTY MONSTER                     Cleveland

We are having a halloween party at Trilogy based on this movie.
We are flying in most of the people that are featured in the film.
For now....
here is SOME  of the info..
PARTY MONSTER...a blood feast
Friday, Oct. 30th   TRILOGY CLEVELAND
performing live.....
SCREAMIN' RACHEL  trax records, chicago
hosting the Hot Body contest...
LARRY TEE  original host of Disco 2000 nyc
In the V.I.P. room....
Ernie Glam and James St. James     original "club kids"
The party will celebrate and recreate the spirit of the original "club
kid" scene.
As it is Halloween, we will also celebrate the "gore" of this heinous
crime. We will be showing the movie throughout the night so people who
haven't seen it, can.    A lot more information about this party is
forthcoming.
This is just a pre-flyer :-) 

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Sat Oct 31                          GROW                          Cleveland

Price is $0 if you bring Halloween candy.

Price is $0 if you wear a costume.

Price is $0 anyway.

OK, the party's in Avon Lake west of Cleveland.  It's about 30 or so east
from downtown in a barn in the middle of a big field.  The barn has nice
concrete floors, 5 wacky shaped rooms (last party kids said it was like a
giant playland) There's room for tents.  It'll be cold, but if you want
to,
there's a place to set up camp.

Here are the directions from Cleveland...
Take I-90 West to Exit 151 (the Sheffield/Avon exit) and take a right.  Go
2 lights and turn right on Abbe Rd.  Go over the bridge, and its the only
house after it on the left.  It's directly across from the Ford plant. 
You'll see 3 barns there with cars parked all around.  Someone out front
will yell at you to park over there where the rest of the cars are.

Pretty easy, huh?

DJs will remain unannounced, but the music will be good (some hard-ass
techno, some jungle, some speed garage, some live stuff).  It will start
around 10-11.  It is very important to ARRIVE EARLY!  This place will hold
maybe 200-300 dancing kids.  The guy throwing this said that after it's
full, no one else will be able to come in.

No phone number yet either, but I guess all the info you need is here
anyway.  The last party here was Phat Free a couple of months ago...a very
good time.  This one should end up even better!

Sat Nov 28                        ENERGIZE                               DC

U L T R A W O R L D 
in association with
CIRCLE, SONIC SOUL, and 2-TUFF

On Saturday November 28, 1998, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend,
Ultraworld will present the most spectacular event in its 6 year history.
It is called ENERGIZE, and that is exactly what we intend for it to do to
the dance music scene on the East Coast and beyond.  It will be held in
the massive DC Armory, and while we have done 4 events in this space
before, none will compare to the excellence of Energize.

The main arena of this space has a legal capacity of 12,000 in one
wide-open, high-ceilinged, wooden-floored expanse, but what will set
Energize apart from our previous events is that we have now been approved
to use the basement! Don't think basement like dark and dingy though,
this basement has ceilings of 40', and makes the biggest dance clubs on
the East Coast look like efficiency apartments in Manhattan.  Plus it's
divided up into rooms of various sizes. 
For the first time at the armory, we will present four rooms of music, all
with full on concert level production in both sound and lighting.  

All performers listed below are confirmed.  The four rooms of Energize
will
be:

The Main Arena:   We will fill this space with the best sound system we
have ever assembled, coupled with a stunning combination of lasers,
projection screens and intelligent lights.  The lineup is one of the best
we have ever presented, a true blend of the most prevalent styles of
electronic dance music.  From hard techno, to trance, to funky breaks, to
fun party music, the main room at Energize is going to be all that and
more.  The performers are:

CARL CRAIG performing live as
Paperclip People  Planet E Records, Detroit
TSUYOSHI SUZUKI  Matsuri Productions  London/Tokyo
DOC MARTIN  Los Angeles
ICEY  Zone, Orlando
SCOTT HENRY  Buzz, DC
T1000  Generator/DJax, Detroit
NIGEL RICHARDS  611 Records, Philadelphia

You may have seen that Uberzone was previously listed in the main room.
They
had said they were available, but then decided to cancel all bookings for
the
rest of the year to make time to write new music. 

The Drum 'n' Bass Arena:  In one of the basement areas, we are proud to
present some of the best U.S. drum 'n' bass talent, along with the
undisputed
champions of the U.K. scene.  This area will be hosted by 2 Tuff
productions
of DC.  The lineup is:

GROOVERIDER  Sony, Prototype, U.K.
FABIO  U.K.
MC GQ  the U.K.'s premier MC
DARA  Breakbeat Science, NYC
DIESELBOY  Platinum, Philadelphia
AK1200  Orlando
DB  Breakbeat Science, NYC
SLANT  2 Tuff, DC
ENTITY  Ultraworld
FLUID  Sonic Soul, Baltimore
MC DUB2  Philadelphia

The Deep House Arena:  This third area, also in the basement, is bigger
then any dance club on the East Coast.  It will be hosted by
Philadelphia's Circle crew, and will present a lineup of dj's that will
keep the househeads groovin' all day long.  The performers are:

DERRICK CARTER  Chicago
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION  Universal Language, U.K.
FEELGOOD  Charm City Records, Baltimore
KENNY GLASGOW  Toronto
O'KEEFE  Circle, Philly
ROB PAINE  Circle, Philly
SEAN THOMAS  Circle, Philly

The Chill Out Arena:  The smallest area of the event, but still bigger
then the main room at most clubs!  This room will be hosted by Baltimore's
respected Sonic Soul crew, and will feature the downtempo side of
electronic music.  You can dance if you want to, with performers:

TIM "LOVE" LEE  Tummy Touch, U.K.
PETE LAWRENCE  the Big Chill, U.K.
WE performing live  Asphodel, NYC
LOVEGROVE  Sonic Soul
DJ C  Toneburst, Boston
RHOMBUS  Sonic Soul

What makes this event even more exciting, is the fact that it will be a
collaborative effort between Ultraworld, Circle, 2Tuff, and Sonic Soul.
While Ultraworld will be the main organizers and provide the direction for
the event, these other three crews will be involved to specifically manage
the areas of music they are most interested in.  What that means for you
is that you get the highest quality of production and care going into
every aspect of the event.

Tickets will be on sale in the DC/Baltimore area on September 30, and
should be at all of the outlets by October 3, and will be broken down as
follows:

There will be 1000 tickets sold for only $20!   So if you know you're
going to go, you have the opportunity to purchase a ticket at that low
price.  We are accepting orders for these tickets now, or you can wait
until they are at the outlets. If you'd like to mail order your ticket,
send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER ONLY, made out to Ultraworld Productions for $20
per ticket ordered.  Send it to:

Ultraworld Productions
3042 O'Donnell St
Baltimore, MD  21224

After those 1000 are gone the price will be $25 up to and including
October 31.  

On November 1st, the admission price goes to $30, and will stay at that
price even the day of the show, at the ticket outlets.  Admission at the
gate will be $35.

Also, we are working with the Buzz crew to make this an extended weekend.
For those of you who may not know, Buzz is DC's premier club event, held
every Friday by DJ's Scott Henry and Lieven De Geyndt.  It plays host to
the world's top DJ's and live acts, and the DC scene in general is one of
the best in the country.  When you purchase your ticket to Energize, there
will be a stub which will allow you to come to Buzz on Friday night for
only $5  (Note: Tickets purchased through Ticketmaster will not have this
stub, but Buzz will honor the $5 admission).   Consider coming to DC on
Friday, and making a long stay of it.  We'll post hotel and travel info on
this site in the weeks to come. 

To stay in DC, try these hotels:
Phoenix Park Hotel (closest to venue)	202.638.6900

AMEN!  HALLELUJAH!
let's put this into practice this weekend!
we're helping by doing things a little differently this time.  no one
will be permitted to flyer during the party.  it's always seemed strange
to me that anyone does this to begin with.  who cares who's coming where
and when, when you're trying to enjoy the party where you are?!  there
will be a flyer table that promoters can put flyers on (raymond the tape
man always lends his table space as well).  that way those who WANT them
will pick them up on their own.  and in the morning flyers can be handed
out at the door as people leave.  this is the only way i've ever done
flyering and it seems to work :)  i hardly ever see my flyers on the
floor--so it helps with clean-up too.  i hope more people start to care
about the venues.  it sure makes things easier in the long run.

thats a good idea, as i understand how much of a pain in the ass 
clean-up is.....but one of my favorite things about raves is the next 
day when you look in the pockets of your pants and find 100+ flyers all 
mashed up into a little ball, and you unkrinkle them and go through them 
and get excited about a party you didnt see on the flyer when you 
recieved it the night before......but i definitely see your point.

I was just wondering whether the discounts are cumulative. I mean,
I know there is a discount for wearing a costume, and one for having
a laminate. Is it an either-or situation, or do they both count. 

Not trying to sound cheap, but...actually yes I am.

Here's a non-rave-related tip for the guys out there:
    
Touching your partner's breast . . . . start by lightly touching the
outside of her breasts, her ribcage, or even her shoulders. Then slowly
work your way towards her nipples, but do not touch her nipples for at
least ten minutes.  To help you out, you may want to time yourself (just
don't tell your partner what you are doing.  Suspense is everything.)  
That way, by the time you start approaching her nipples, she will be
wiggling around clamoring for you to touch it. Then ever so slowly, let
the tip of your thumb brush over the top of her nipple.  Then, begin to
massage the outside parts of her breast for a few minutes. Again, resume
the light touch and circle her breast.  Then bring your mouth down onto
the breast suck on it.  After a long time, move your lips towards her
nipples and suck on her nipples, after a few moments, move your mouth away
again.  Then begin again by lightly touching her nipple with your tongue.  
Increase your speed. Increase the pressure, then pull back and begin the
whole cycle again.  There are no 'special' ways to touch the breast.  The
key parts to remember is to change the pace, pressure, type of strokes and
to NOT focus on the nipples.  There are many other parts of the breasts
than just that. Part of good breast fondling is the lead-up. What you need
to keep in the back of your mind, is that you are trying to entice her,
tempt her and excite her, to the point that she is wishing you would pick
up the pace.

Ah, ya!!

Braden

AZ, I feel your pain.  I would have to say the same.  

Here's a non-rave-related tip for the guys out there:

How is this not rave related? What do YOU guys do at raves?
  
>Touching your partner's breast . . . . start by lightly touching the
>outside of her breasts, her ribcage, or even her shoulders. Then slowly
>work your way towards her nipples, but do not touch her nipples for at

<snip>

All I have to say is: "I'm horny...horny,horny,horny! So horny...I'm
horny,horny,horny!"

this is just in response to the two rather 'smutty' messages posted
earlier today.  i am in no way attempting to offend or infringe on
expression rights in any way, but i find posts pertaining to porno and
detailed sexual experience unnecessary on a list meant for people
interested in music and parties. 

i think emails such as this would find maybe a higher response or more
interest on email lists pertaining to sexual topics.

i also just wanted to note, in reply to braden's post, that although you
may find this entertaining and worthy of application to *your* life, i
don't think that any single method, whether it be sexual or nonsexual, may
ever be applied to ALL members of a given group.  there's always
exceptions, especially when it comes to sexual arousal.  i would like to
hope that one cannot formulate into a step by step method a way in which
every person enjoys and responds to certain signals. if there were, sex,
and even intimate contact in general would be unpersonalized and most
likely not as enjoyable.

I admit I may be a little bias knowing some of the spawn crew, but The way i
see it is that if u look at all the good parties they have thrown over the
years and all the great acts they have brought us(many of them for the 1st
time). Then that makes up for 1 or 2 bad parties. A promoter does not stay in
the scene for 5 years throwing whack parties. I have talked to a few people
that said the first Suicide was a great party. Despite the miss haps.
I was at No Shit I had a great time! the lighting,video, sound, lasers, and
crowd were all great. A lot of times people have great times at bad parties and
bad times at great parties. For those of you who dont know they have lost money
at all three 4:20 parties, and many other parties as well. I would have to
think they are gonna lose money on Sat. But they keep going.

Why would they name it Another Suicide? After the disaster 2 years ago. For
once i hope a party doesnt live up to its name.:)
I will post a review to let everyone know how it went. I hope i dont end up
eating my words.

thats just my take on it. Well have to go.
plur

You said it...your bias seems to be clouding your judgement big time

what were their good parties?
what about the djs who haven't shown up?
have you read the reviews from the archives about the first suicide?
they are all saying the same thing, the party was shit, they felt ripped off
and were pissed off
if i remember correctly, 3 djs did not show up,
and it was still $25!
even you admit that it was a disaster!
There are LOTS of promoters who throw shitty parties who are still around
Losing money has nothing to do with it, it just shows that some people can't
tell good from shit
I'm not here to slam you or Spawntaneous, simply to point out what everyone
else seems to get...
Majick=fun
Another Suicide=Shit

go ahead, post your review
I will be reading it from Cali, basking in the sunshine

i need to borrow/buy a smooth white round shiny helmet, preferably with visor.
like old-school motorcycle style - think speed racer.  

i've made a decent but fruitless effort around pittsburgh.  someone pointed
out to me that there are probably a thousand helmets like the one i'm looking
for sitting in basements.  so if this is happening in your basement ... i can
put an end to that ...

Here and interesting tid-bit I learned while watching the space shuttle launch
 today; at 31 seconds in the countdown the manual systems are taken over 
 by the computer control launch system, this computer ignites the rockets 
 and sends the shuttle into orbit. I thought some peeps might like to know.

Don't forget the drugs and the purity tests!  Oh, and please note that

Translated: Don't try any of the previously mentioned breast-fondling
techniques with this girl, who would much rather be slapped around a
bit.

Actually, I have seen some very detailed, step-by-step oral sex
technique accounts which *most* people, men and women, could stand to
learn from.  This 'breasts' one was new to me, but hey, new is fine. 
I think it's wonderful that this stuff, be it smut, floats around on
the internet.  It's a hell of a lot better than how things were thirty
years ago when women were told that only vaginal orgasms were
acceptable and 'mature.'

My post had to do with music. Anyone who has been to a rave in the 
last six months would know exactly what I was talking about. Anyway,
there was a post about a porno being filmed at a rave, so I thought
smut was on the agenda for the day.

>i think emails such as this would find maybe a higher response or more

Try not to think too much, it can only be dangerous.

>i also just wanted to note, in reply to braden's post, that although 
you
>may find this entertaining and worthy of application to *your* life,

If you didn't want to read it, you didn't have to. There is this
button called 'delete' somewhere included in your newsreader, find
it and discover it's wonderous uses.

> i
>don't think that any single method, whether it be sexual or nonsexual,

Wow, that's a real breakthrough. Maybe you should look into becoming
a sociologist.

>there's always
>exceptions, especially when it comes to sexual arousal.  

No way! You mean _everybody_ doesn't use a cattle prod and bamboo
shoots?

>i would like to
>hope that one cannot formulate into a step by step method a way in

>every person enjoys and responds to certain signals. if there were,

Come now, I ordered Braden's book, "10,000 ways of Pleasuring Your 
Partner" and it is awesome! I doubt that any of the techniques
described inside would ever fail to bring any female to complete and
utter orgasmic bliss.

i am sorry that you must hide behind your crude and assaulting methods of
discussing a message.  i don't believe i once made an abrasive or
attacking comment, simply expressing my opinion.  if you cannot remain
civil and cannot find more intelligent means besides berasive emotionalism
of replying then don't.

and if you are *really* confident in yourself as a female and view
explicit material as suitable for this list, you should at least have the
knowledge and the self-pride not to throw sexist slurs and jokes about
battery around when, as you so poignantly pointed out, the history of
women as subordinate is extensive and part of your culture now and of
those females long before you.

so maybe you should read a little and take yourself and your
gender stratified beliefs seriously before writing hypocritical messages
full of personal attacks based on absolutely no fact.

bring it on!!!
I'm not sure that I approve of filming a porno at a rave (I mean, since
all pornos have bad music, does that mean that the music is going to
suck? ;)
but I am a big big fan of booty house music (In fact, I just bought a
new dj funk 12" tonight and am really excited about listening to it)

"if you are offended by the words [bitch] [ho] [slut] [tramp]
dirty...lo... slut... bitch...tramp...ho..."
from my favorite dj funk track: dirtylosluttrampbitchho 
(p.s. does anyone know the real name and the name of the 12"? I've been
looking for it forever!!!)

i also am a fan of dj funk and find the words in his music, and in ghetto
house music in general, funny.  no i'm not offended by them, but those
words are not attempting to preach about how to satisfy a woman, that's
obvious.

all i was saying was that i just find sex a more personal thing between
two people.  i have no objection to people wanting to learn how to achieve
higher sexual responses in each other, but i think they should seek
sources at a personal level and not advertise.

phew. one lousy email and all this hype.

btw, thanks for being civil :)

I think that you are just a little out of place being on this
list. Those of us that have been on it for a few years......
well...... are a lot more liberal that you appear to be
why don't you think about unsubscribing and rather
instead subscribe to the puritans list?
Seems like it would be more fitting.
I would venture to say that Vaughn Schtupp has gotten
at least a few personal notes in support of her
reaction to your post.
Personally, I loved Bradens post. He is always bringing
new fresh ideas and comments to the list.

not quite 2cnts......but whose counting?

Hey, what's to hide?  You read *way* too much into my post, which was
intended to be taken very lightly -- tongue in cheek, if you will. 
"Berasive emotionalism" -- hmm, I think that was your post, not mine.

I made no mention of battery for its sake alone.  I made a flippant
remark about sex, based upon your apparent aversion to anyone's
talking about breast fondling techniques.  Yes, this is ludicrous! 
This is a big joke, and it should have been treated as such since the
beginning!  I simply cannot take people seriously who take themselves
so seriously.

bleah.

Hrm.  I've also been on the list 'for a few years' and find Braden's post
completely unnecessary and alienating towards women.  *shrug* I sat there
reading it desperately SEARCHING for ANY vauge connection.  How "liberal"
and free thinking shall we get on a list promoting music?

	My detailed account of erotic midget bathtub sex is soon to come
as well...glad we've finally opened the doors here.  {insert sarcastic
smirk here.}

Love yas, :)

trout, get rid of that obnoxious subject prefix with tom cox's name in it.

-Andy

> P.S. -- Hey does anyone even know what 'Schtupp' means 
> in Yiddish? 

yes, it means "take me to Armenia"

hey list, i am unsure of my magick status.  i planned on flying home for
it 3 weeks ago.  i am still coming home and i want to see everybody.  but
i fucked up my shins (YET FUCKING AGAIN MOTHERFUCKER) at a club last
weekend.  it was a very nice club.  it was like the club on basic
instinct, except doc martin was spinning hardhouse.  the doorprice was 15
dollars and everyone wore black. i think it's good to experience "club"
scene and "rave" scene in order to make valid arguments about the two. 
also, i found that attending clubs solidified my love for raves and the
rave pool.  first, why does everyone look the same there.  why is everyone
afraid to dance hard/break a sweat?  why do people spend 3 dollars on a
plastic cup of water prepared by a bartender when you could just steal one
while she wasnt looking and get some from the bathroom sink - TWICE!  ahh
yess, applying rave skills to the club environment.  it just erked me that
everyone thought i was "breaking code/program/norm" when i started dancing
the way i normally do at raves.  it prompted 5 small asian females to
dance with me.  and when i blew my cheesy whistle, everyone was like
"WHAT?" it may have been "SHUT THE FUCK UP".  i won't be going back to
"karma" "avalon" or "axis" [hyperclubs in boston]...but they put me on the
guestlist for abnormal dance ability...it gave me such an ego trip.  and
yes, that was my highly cohesive essay on clubbing/raving.  oh yeah, there
is 89% more grinding.  and another thing, i kept having to stop my dance
routine because people kept walking into me. i went to a club the night
before "karma", "avalon" [the trendy/electronica subversive one] and
they had fat drag queens making out with plastic horses..they could have
done so much more with that.  i danced on an elevated plane at that one.
why did i just type all this? i don't know.  maybe i'll just take NSAIDS
and fucking go to magick.  i mean, how many magicks will there be?  can
you attend/keep tabs on all of the magick variants? will i fail my
chemistry exam on monday if i rave saturday night?  no, not if i go study
now....

I recently talked to a guy in FL about drugs, and well....he happens to work
in a Hours stable, and trains them for racing, and he tells me of Super
Special K.  Does this really exist?  He says K is really a cat tranq, and the
Super K is a house tranq.  Anybody hear of that?  Just curious..thats all.

i bet it was a big lie to make you excited.  goto a pharmacology site and

Hmm, I've never heard it called that, but I bet he's talking about
PCP, which is still used as a horse tranquilizer.

                                     ANSWERS


1) What is Water?

        Water, W, Hot Ice, Liquid Crystal... all these "street" terms refer to
the same substance, known chemically as H20.  Water is a highly addictive and
toxic chemical, which in its natural state is completely odorless, tasteless,
and clear.


2) Is Water dangerous?

        Yes.  A scientific survey recently concluded that every creature on
earth contains Water, and almost every creature imbibes more during its life. 
Moreover, every animal that has ever ingested this substance has invariably
tried to get more.  Organisms unable to get more Water show signs of
withdrawal, or "dehydration," and eventually die.  Organisms that ingest more
Water inevitably die anyway.
        Aside from the biological considerations, remember that Water is
composed of Hydrogen and Oxygen, which are used together as rocket fuel.  
Enough cannot be said about the volatile nature of this chemical.


3) Can I put Water in my bong?

        Mixing drugs is never recommended, but if you must attempt this, note
the following:

        -Water acts as a coolant and filter.  You are likely to get larger,
         smoother hits than normal.

        -Water may actually blend into the smoke, imparting its own qualities
         to the hit.

        -Water may splash up and get in your mouth.  Yuck.


4) A FOAF got some laced Water.  How frequently does this happen?

        Almost all Water contains some contaminants.  Generally, since Water
has no taste or odor, the presence of either of these may indicate foreign
substances.  Water is so strong, and so cheap to produce, that the story of
the dealer who dusted his grass to make it salable doesn't really apply.


5) How is Water synthesized?

        The simplest synthesis is as follows:

        -Fill a pot from the kitchen tap.

        -Boil for fifteen minutes.

        The Water is now suitable for ingestion.

        Steve J. Quest gives a more involved recipe yielding a higher-grade
        intoxicant:

                    Preparation of Hydrogen Oxide (Water)
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        An Erlenmeyer flask is first filled with a few grams of zinc
        metal chips and is then fitted with a two hole rubber stopper. A
        thistle tube is introduced through one hole and pushed to a
        level where the end of the tube is just above the zinc chips. A
        rubber tube is introduced through the other hole and connected
        to a horizontal copper pipe filled with loose fitting chunk
        cupric oxide.  The other end of the copper pipe is connected to
        a Liebig condenser mounted in a distilling fashion (open end
        pointing down) which is suspended above a capture beaker.

        A bunsen flame is placed under the cupric oxide reaction pipe,
        and any kind of cold liquid is allowed to circulate through the
        condenser.  (some would use cold tap Water, but I can not
        recommend that procedure here due to legalities involved.)

        Sufficient quantities of concentrated sulfuric acid are then
        introduced through the thistle tube to completely cover the zinc
        chips to a level ABOVE the end of the thistle tube. Condensation
        will start to occur within the condenser and run out into the
        beaker.  The crude product represents a technical grade of
        hydrogen oxide, suitable for recreational purposes.

        The reaction sequence is as follows:

        Zn + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2        H2 + CuO -> Cu + H2O


6) Is homebrewed "bathtub" Water as effective as "the real thing?"

        In the author's opinion, "bathtub" Water ("slosh") will never be able
to compete with legendary types like Owsley, Naya, and Perrier, but there is
of course a certain satisfaction in synthesizing your own.


7) What is 'kind' Water?

        According to Peter McDermott:

        There are actually two major kinds. 'Soft' Water and 'Hard' 
        Water. The 'soft' Water does less damage (to kettles, pipes, etc.)
        but the hard Water is a better hit. 

        Some people argue that there is something called a 'gatevalve'
syndrome,
        where some people who begin on the relatively harmless 'soft'
Water are
        likely to escalate to the hard stuff. However, this isn't true
of everybody.
        Personally, I've been drinking soft Water for years without ever
trying 
        anything harder.


8) Are there different types of Water?

        Christopher K. Koenigsberg explains:

        There are apparently variations in the chemical makeup of W sold in
        stores, so someone should look into this for the FAQ (W's still
        available over the counter, no prescription necessary, not yet
        regulated by the FDA, nor scheduled by the DEA, I guess? How much
        longer before they catch on? Maybe we should be more cautious and not
        talk about it so openly, before they start having congressional
        hearings or something?)

        For example I've seen W labelled "Steam Distilled" but on the same
        shelf also seen W labelled "Drinking Water" and even "Spring Water",
        and a more expensive kind for Babies (yes they are even hooking
        innocent infants) and there may or may not be differences beyond just
        the labels and packaging. There are variations in the price even for
        the same kind of stuff, the local store brand is always the cheapest,
        regional "Artesian Wells" etc. are more expensive, and the imported
        kind is most expensive.

        There are vending machines outside some grocery stores (hey! you don't
        even have to show an ID to prove your age!) which will disburse W
        either Distilled or for Drinking, into your own choice of unlabelled
        container (so you can pretend it's something else). And the Drinking
        kind supposedly has mineral additives. I don't know if this is
        Strychnine, among the additives, which maybe causes the cramps when
        you drink too much, too fast, or too cold.... but I hear that's just a
        myth.


9) What is the LD50 of Water?

CHRONIC EFFECTS
OTHER HEALTH HAZARDS
PRIMARY INFECTIONS OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) ARE USUALLY ASYMPTOMATIC
BUT IN RARE CASES, SUBSEQUENT INFECTIONS MAY CAUSE MONONUCLEOSIS-LIKE
DISEASE. CMV CAN ALSO RESULT IN LATENT INFECTIONS AND HAS BEEN
IMPLICATED IN CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER.

This is of course in mice and may not apply directly to humans.  W can be
very dangerous, so play nice and be safe.



              APPENDIX 1:  Descriptions of Water 'trips' and usage


        Kevin Jernigan, alt.drugs #85634:

   I drank Water for the first time at a party last night, and it was great!!
Some of my friends who do W told me about the experience earlier, but I now
realize that it was beyond my wildest expectations.  I was a little bit
scared,
at first, because I heard about some of the bad side effects that it can
cause.
A few people said they choked on it, and one guy said that he dribbled
it all   
over his clothes and got them wet.  Luckily, none of these things happened to 
me.  They started passing glasses around to everyone and I decided to
take one  
The Water was very clear in color. They said it was scored from a guy who got
it from a spring in Canada.  I don't know whether it was really Canadian 
Water, but it was definitely good quality, judging by the color.  I used
about 500g of it.  When I put the glass up to my mouth, and swallowed, the
first sensation I felt was of something wet traveling down my throat.  This 
sensation started before I had even removed the glass from my mouth.  I was
able to acheive the same feeling again, by taking another swallow.  As the 
trip progressed, I noticed several other things.  The W produced a state of
mind that I believe could best be described as a lack of thirst.  The trip
didn't last for very long, but I think that it would be safe to say that
the experience gave me some important insights into my consciousness.  
Chief among these, is the realization that Water can relieve thirst. 


        Ray Mialki, email contribution:

Although I don't partake, some of my neighbours down quite a bit of the
stuff, filling swimming pools and such.  I use it in great moderation,
not even having an outside hose spigot to wash the car with.  Daily
showers seem to be my habitual use.  


        Peter McDermott, alt.drugs #unknown:

A recent major survey (n=1) has showed that Water addiction runs in families.
At present, NIDA funded scientists are working flat out on the genesis of
this crippling condition.

Unlike other addictions, W abuse is believed to affect all sections of
society,
rich and poor alike. However, scientists have discovered that a gene may well
be responsible for a predisposition to drinking W.

Although 12 step 'W' recovery programmes have been around for some time
now, major cities have begun to witness a growth in self-help programs for
Adult Children of Waterholics. "Henry" is a member of such a group.

        "Well, I've just got so much rage about this, y'know? I was never
        able to confront them about it at the time. I thought that 
        drinking Water was normal. 

        Now I'm angry. Ours is a sick culture. The French would never dream
        of exposing their children to 'W' at dinner. There, the kids go from
        breast milk to wine. But every single day, there it was, sitting at 
        the dinner table in front of me. Of course, they wouldn't let me have
        any, but after watching them do it, I saw where they got it from. I 
        began sneaking to the tap, and taking a sip. Before I knew where I was
        I was into the hard stuff - you know, Water sports. Baths, showers,
        stuff like that. 

        Well, eventually, I hit bottom. I out in town and the craving came on
        me and I found myself licking it up from puddles. Then it was toilet
        bowls. There are no wells too deep for the 'W' addict. So I went and
        got help. I've been in recovery for like.. 3 days now, but I wasn't
        making any progress. Then my therapist told me about A CoW and since
        then, it's been nothing but milk. And not mother's milk either..."

However, not everybody accepts that 'W' use is a problem. 'Mary' has been
using 'W' for a month now. She feels that the dangers of 'W' have been
much exaggerated.

        "It's all propaganda, isn't it? I've been doing 'W' for ages now, and
        it's just a bit of a buzz, innit. It's harmless man. There isn't a
        single study that *proves* 'W" has any effect on the bladder, and as
        for people who say it makes you piss. Well, they are just dirty
minded.
        As I said, I've been doing 'W' for a month, and I've never had a piss,
        ever.

        We've started a pressure group called 'Fair Play for Water' and
it's our
        aim to force the government to tell the truth about 'W'. If there are
        risks, tell us what they are, and how we can minimize them.
Prohibition doesn't
        work. The government knows that. Why else would they have repealed the
        laws against heroin and cocaine? Unfortunately, there are political 
        careers to be made out of that issue. Vote Libertarian. Privatise the
        Water companies. Stop all government regulation of Water now!!!!

        Chicago, IL, North Shore Area
                -Typical Naya, $1 US per liter.

        Springdale Township, Pennsylvania 
                $5 per 1000 gallons.



                   APPENDIX 3:  International Legality Update


        In Europe W is becoming something of a threat real fast. I myself 
have witnessed tourists trying to score W desperately the last couple 
of hot days here this week. As of yet there is no shortage of W, but I've 
heard that in Greece it's getting scary. 
        The police are starting to recognise this situation and have
called for 
more forces on the street, weeding out W-pushers and sentencing them to 
severe punishments straight away!

THIS IS VERY IMPORATANT!

             For those of you that don't know, MTV annoys me.  
Especially when they have the top ten most requested videos.  It just 
goes to show the intelligence of millions of dumb asses when day after 
day they keep selecting backstreet boys and N(homo)Sync.  So, to fuck 
with the mindless masses, wouldn't it be funny to not only vote for a 
video that isn't on MTV ever, but one that many of these kids have never 
seen.  On November 12, vote for the Ah-Ha video for "Take On Me".  It 
would kick ass if it got on.  Besides, how often does one really get to 
fuck with MTV.  Send this to as many friends as you have and tell as 
many people as you know that can operate a telophone.  Put posters up at 
school, write it on the bathroom wall, whatever you need to get it done.  
There have to be a lot of requests for it to get on in the first place.  
Of course, if you don't send this on to anyone or you chose not to 
participate, nothing will happen to you, but that does prove that YOU 
SUCK!~!  So, the phone number is 1-800-dial- MTV, or you can vote via 
the MTV website.  Phone lines open at 3:00pm and are open until 3:30.  I 
hope everyone who gets this not only participates themselves, but get 
others to participate too.  Remember, November 12, Rock the vote:  "Take 
on Me", By AH-HA!!!!

never heard of "super K" but there are horse and cat tranquilizers. One
being alot stronger than the other...obviously. The guy that cuts my hair
used to snort horse tranq....they would cook it up in his kitchen. You
should hear some of his stories, they are definately hardcore. He claims
that one night he had a conversation w/ his dead grandpa and all kinds of
weird shit.

K = EViL :-)~

i don't think the promoter of this party thinks it's "a joke".  I was

"wave of the future" and "all you people with closed minds ought to come 
check it out".   pretty whack if you ask me

words dont offend people. theyre only words. dont make me prove how many 
offensive things i can say without meaning a damn thing by them. thats 
exactly why nobody likes me. im found to be abrasive, because people 
take themselves too seriously. i cannot be offended, except by extreme 
stupidity.
i am offended by this quoted text,

Just wanted to warn everyone.  Every list member will be required to have sex
with at least one other list member during the net-meet.  Those who put on the
best performance will get to participate in the pb-cle orgy on the main stage
at our next event.  Get ready guys, this is your moment to shine!

knocks you out cold.  i dont think this stuff is anything like k, even
though ive never done either, nor would i ever.

There's gonna have to be a lot of gay sex,
cuz we need more girls. 
I'm glad I won't be there!

Oh, and I oficially don't like Trilogy.
Guess I'm not a club kid.

first off, the show kicked ass.  they got started really late which was
annoying (around 2:30).. but they had an awesome show.  They brought their
own lights and had a video projection screen.  Excellent on both of those.
The set lasted until 3:45, so a fair 1h15m .. it was really good though.
Everyone was tired but kept on moving.  It was pretty surprising how many
people actually stayed for the whole thing.  I saw them at Intergalatic
Circus and they were good, but tonite they were amazing.  For those of you
in Columbus and Cleveland (and where ever else they are going to play) .. GO
SEE THEM.  You won't regret it...

Not even close.  Think 80's euro-pop band that had one really popular

I just hagve to say that I stay away from that shit.  I didnt want to give the
wrong impression that I wanted it or anything.  All the stories of K-holes and
shit scare me.  Amy is right K = EVIL!  I just posted the question incase
anybody did hear of it, so we would konw what new shit could be coming, to
warn us to not support that shit.  Oh yea...before I forget, can somebody post
the directions to Magick?  Thanks.

I know I probably missed some people so throw an e-mail my way.

NET-MEET: 2AM at the 2 tables (not tech 12's and no microphone either
silly....) in the
lobby..........

Bring your pumpkins, witches, goblins, monsters, candy-corn, slimy
things (not from the
bathroom.....), trolls, masks, costumes, and all of the usual plurry
stuff too.

BRING SIGNS TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW!!!!

Oh, dont be shy...you said that you wanted to go especially for this
net-meet...dont deny it.  In fact, I think your dj name should be "dj
Dave".  You should take after that good but gay, "dj Dan" guy.  Not that I
have anything against gay people, of course;-)

	Hey...I'm doing a research/design project on Sano and need to find
as many works of his as possible.  Does anybody know where to find a copy
of the most recent Family Affair flyer on the net? Or anybody with any
info on how to find more of his works would be much appreciated.  Thank
you :)

Hello Friends of Circle...

we are very proud to announce two very special events taking place over the
next few weeks.

First on Sunday November 8, we are happy to present the MEAT BEAT MANIFESTO
show.  Performing with MBM will be JOSH WINK(in a live/dj set), DJ KRUSH(from
Japan), LUKE VIBERT(aka Wagon Christ) and Q-BURNS ABSTRACT MESSAGE(from
Florida). 

INFO: The Electric Factory- 7th and Willow (between Spring Garden +
Callowhill)
The doors open @ 8:00 PM, tickets ae available at all Ticketmaster locations. 


Next, we are happy to announce the third installment of the GLOBAL HOUSE
series to take place on Sunday, November 15, 1998. For Global House 3, in his
first ever Philly appearance, we wish to welcome- the one and only, DERRICK
CARTER to spin an incredible THREE HOUR SET on 3 decks!!!  

Global House takes place once a month at Fluid Nightclub (613 South 4th
Street, Philadelphia- across from 611 Records). 

Fluid is a tight and intimate club with a 300 person capacity.  It has the
interior design similar to that of a Salvador Dali painting (not one right
angle in the entire place), one of Philly's most intense Sound Systems, and a
kick ass intelligent lighting rig.

Tickets for Global House 3, will be $10. we recommend arriving early, for this
event is bound to sell out.

hey Braden

so basically what you are saying is spend about an hour carressing the 
breasts but only touch the nipple for about 30 seconds of that time ...  
ken boone must have heard about this before  because he's been having 
sex for "6 years" ... Ken,  you two about done???  ; )

i got one thing to say about a party to celebrate a convicted killer and a
worthless asshole with an ego the size of a small galaxy.

FUCK YOU.

i wouldn't be caught dead anywhere near such lameness. and i doubt anyone
else on this list would want anything at all to do with this obviously
pathetic excuse for a human being.

have a ride back to Columbus. If anyone has room in their car, I'd
really appreciate it. My friend Liz and I will need rides, if possible.
If that's not possible, how about just me? I need to make this party.
Thanks alot for your help. I promise I won't bite (too hard)........

You know I'm addicted to this list.  I'm posting directions here before
the info. line.  Maybe we won't let the "others" in tomorrow.  It can be
our pb-cle party.
Naaa, I guess we better let em in.

Here are the directs:

Take the Ohio Turnpike to the PA Turnpike
Take exit #3-Cranberry
to 79-south towards Pittsburgh
to 279-south
Follow signs for the Ft. Pitt Tunnel
Get off at the Strip District exit before you reach the tunnel
Go straight towards the Convention Center and stay in the left lane
Keep going until you go through an underpass
It will wind to the right and you'll then make a left onto Smallman
Street.
Park in any of the lots along Smallman.  The earlier the better.
Parking is tough here and it is Halloween.  You can try your luck on the
streets too.
the venue is the Paintball Sports Arena on 17th Street between Penn and
Smallman.  Behind Costume World for you late dresser uppers.

It is a 2 room space.  The party is NON-SMOKING.  There will be a
smoking room to the side of the lobby.  Anyone caught smoking in either
of the main rooms will be asked to leave.  Please be on the look-out.
This is a very important rule.

We have great security that will be there working for you tomorrow.  I
encourage anyone to report any disrespect of the space or another person
to anyone with a laminate (preferably me).  This is your party and the
continuation of this scene depends on how well we can work together.
It's your job to be aware of your surroundings.

The space is divided into the arena (where printable is played) and the
lobby (very cool and clean).  We'll be working hard with a lot of help
tomorrow to clean up the arena as much as possible.  There is still a
chance however of paint lingering from earlier.  Keep this in mind when
you think of leaning.   The lobby is clean and spacious.  There will be
headliners in both rooms.

Eyegasm, Electrolyte F/X, and The Reflective Collective are going to put
on a great visual show with lots of cool lights, 3 lasers, lots of
Halloween artsy stuff, and video too.
Wizard Workshop and Midnite Blue are our sound experts.

Special thanks to Andy the Pooh for his work in setting everything up to
broadcast the event to his web site.  He will archive all the DJ sets.
Be sure to check out his site next week to re-live the party.

We're so happy to have special Halloween guests.  Look for Animal X as
well as the balloon animal clown boy, and the Ruckus drum crew.

The time slots have changed since I last posted them.  I'll post them
tomorrow.
The after-hours is invite only due to limited space.  Rich and I will
have invites with us tomorrow.  Just ask us for one if you plan on
staying around for OSheen, Nauti Groove, and Zemo.

Have a safe trip if you're driving.  See you all tomorrow!

speaking of which, if people are still interested in getting a pb-cle
party going, i'm ready to do it whenever you are. i'd like to have a
seperate mailing list for it, tho.. this one's high traffic enuff. add in
discussions for who to book, where, etc, etc.. well, you get the picture. 

anyways, i tell you this much.. if we do have a pb-cle party, you can be
sure burn studios, ltd. and ketyra audio, unlimited will definitely be in
on it. we got toys; why not share? ;)

andy the pooh's been saying "it's gonna be off the hook!"

metropol was packed ... i think last night was probably the highest-attended
atomic i've ever seen ... someone said 1000 kids were there?  that sounds
steep but my friend said she was afraid to go to the bathroom cos it was so
damn crowded.  (she's new.)  geekboy says the capacity at metropol is 1200, i
guess that sounds right i don't know why i was buggin the first time he said
that.  sorry g-boy ickyrus

DJ DAN IS A VERY GOOD DJ.  i don't know if i appreciate my cover charge going
to pay for his streeeetch limo but he's really really good.  i get the feeling
his skills didn't get enough appreciation.  a perfect blend of smooth and
rough ... lots of different breaks ... the buildups were synchronized
perfectly ... he just knew when to let the beat drop.  and he knew the records
to well ... he'd put the records together so well ... go dan, go dan, go - go
- go

big ups to 412 area and beyond for helpen this night become a weekly event
with an actual vibe.  my pants became a conversation piece, thanks to all who
stopped to tell me you love my shiny pants, and no luv to those who used it as
an excuse to cop a feel :P the dance floor was just bumpin, i mean kids were
dansen over by the downstairs bar, by the coatcheckachecka, and the b-boys
were breaken over by the bafrooms ... i couldn't break in pvc pants but it's
always a fun distraction.

ATOMIC THURSDAZE AT METROPOL!  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN YET, U BETTA STEP!  

cyalls at magick ... i'm bein speed racer ... go speed racer ...

where are all these people gonna go??

OMG... and i was so excited for this party... i even got a fucking
costume... grrr!!

i'm sorry taht i gotta be a little bitch abt this... i figured hey... its a

Costas. galve@ibm.net + Donny & Claudia (from Canton, oh.. and she's really
excited for this party... what a fucking disappointment....)

point system...and i heard that some over 50, Hungarian females, with
babushkas, from laurenceville are doing the judging...are we allowed to use
viagra..because if we are not i have a small problem..can we use props from
the local porno store...hey if this were a contest of getting screwed with
your clothes on, i bet i would win.  i be sure to bring some perigees to
butter up those judges...hey i just remembered i need a partner...any
volunteers maybe we could do a rehearsal in the port-a-john before the
contest..just the thought of that is getting me excited..oops something came

Damn.  I never knew the party changed hosts.  I still thought i was playing

You should be sorry that you were a bitch about this.  you should also think
before you post something like this to an entire list.  ANyone who knows rich
and kelly should know that they wouldn't hold something this size in a space
that wouldn't accomadate.  In my opinion they are one of the tightest
production companies i have witnessed in a long long time.  please think about
what you are going to say next time.

In my opinion, downlow must have a pretty good feeling about this party if
they are tolerating all of these questions and in my opinion, thats a good
thing.  I have been going to parties for about tha last 4 years, and I
could never ever ask these types of questions.  Two reasons...1) The
production company wasnt cool enough to hang with tha kids and allow this,
and 2)Id just go to tha party and whatever happens, happens.  That way, I
didnt have to waste my time stressin.  Surprises are always nice.  I dont
know about you all, but when I go to a party I always have a goood time.
If you go with a good outlook on things, this will just help influence tha
vibe so much more. And besides, if things dont work out, there is always a
reason.
			Keep it real-dont waste your time stressin,

Oh, dont be shy...you said that you wanted to go especially for this
net-meet...dont deny it.  In fact, I think your dj name should be "dj
Dave".  You should take after that good but gay, "dj Dan" guy.  Not that I

In my opinion, downlow must have a pretty good feeling about this party if
they are tolerating all of these questions and in my opinion, thats a good
thing.  I have been going to parties for about tha last 4 years, and I
could never ever ask these types of questions.  Two reasons...1) The
production company wasnt cool enough to hang with tha kids and allow this,
and 2)Id just go to tha party and whatever happens, happens.  That way, I
didnt have to waste my time stressin.  Surprises are always nice.  I dont
know about you all, but when I go to a party I always have a goood time.
If you go with a good outlook on things, this will just help influence tha
vibe so much more. And besides, if things dont work out, there is always a
reason.

I know I probably missed some people so throw an e-mail my way.

NET-MEET: 2AM at the 2 tables (not tech 12's and no microphone either
silly....) in the
lobby..........

Bring your pumpkins, witches, goblins, monsters, candy-corn, slimy
things (not from the
bathroom.....), trolls, masks, costumes, and all of the usual plurry
stuff too.

BRING SIGNS TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW!!!!

No sweat.  Gossip can be fun.  I knew that would happen when Twins
decided to use the space before us.  Anyway, I did want to mention that
we are encouraging people to come as early as possible.  The venue is big
however we're getting a way bigger response than we anticipated.  This
one might top the Pittsburgh scales.  It's hard to predict without
pre-sales but I would get there as early as you can.  The net-meet alone
blows me away.  This will sure be one to remember.
See yall soon :)

	In my opinion, it is very nice that Rich and Kelly will allow all of these
questions. Ive been going to parties for about 4 yrs now, and I never asked
these questions.  For two reasons: 1) I would never know who to ask because
the production company wouldnt hang around the kids and make themselves
accessable, and 2)I would just go to parties and let whatever happens
happen. This would make me feel less stress, and if I went to a party with
a positive outlook, it would help tha vibe all the more.  Besides, surprise
are always nice.  Rich and Kelly must have a good feeling about Magick if
they are willing to answer these questions without any problems.  So, its
all good then.  Dont stress!  If something does go wrong, everything
happens for a reason. Just go and enjoy!  Give Rich and Kelly a reason to
feel good about themselves in tha morning; whenever that comes.  Ohhh...and
I have a question for Rich..."How the hell did you get so damn cool?".
				Keep it real-and keep your blood pressure 				down to a minimum(dont
waste time stressin),

I would be all up for this. I think that the tallied votes were in favor
of a mid-size party, but that was a busy week for me and I wasn't
counting. Did anyone else keep track?

I'd love to start planning for this party, but my contributions will have
to be limited because I'm preparing for the GREs and getting gradschool
apps ready.

i dont want to be a downer here coz some ppl really seem to like doing
them, _but_ a few ppl have mentioned to me about seeing 5-10 lists a day in
their inboxes.   these are the lists that are for the .net.meets.
it would work much better if one person did the lists for the parties and
posted them maybe every few days until the few days before the party and
then posted 'em once a day.
and reply to the person organizing them, not the list with an "add me",
this really hurts the s/n ratio....

t.

p.s. and remember its still pick on tom cox week!  thats why he's not going
to magick, he knows we'll all pick on him

hey everyone, i'm sooo excited for halloween ... and i'm so happy that almost
everyone is getting their shit together so we can all be at one party

look for me speed racer ... my name is david, i have a big red zit on my left
cheek too (not my butt cheek) say hi to me!!!  

oh and on behalf of costas i have to apologize for his big mouth ... he didn't
realize that kelly got the actual arena, he was at a party where they used
only the lobby but his negativity was uncalled for, i'm gonna see to it that
he smiles extra special to make up for it, even if i have to give him a big
wet one myself

 fucking midwest (mid-east\whatever) is gonna try to get to this party...
 where are all these people gonna go??
 
 OMG... and i was so excited for this party... i even got a fucking

    Atomic Babies.....hmmmmm...in a word: totally, incredibly, fookin'
amazing!!!!!

It was an incredible time, but hotter than a monkey's ass (does that
make sense?)!!! They went on at 1:30 and went until Red Zone closed at
2:30. I was great, but way to short for my liking. It was great cuzz I
hadn't seen them since Space in Cleveland a little while back.......it
brought back great memories! One reccommendation: GO SEE THEM! We dance
our asses off until we passed out from the heat. Red Zone needs to get
some big-ass fans! We could only dance for about 15 minutes and then we
moved to the back and just watched. I wish we could've danced longer,
but that's the way it is. So, I guess that my review. It was an amazing
night. After the babies, we checked out Darkside 6 and it was an
enlightening experience. Some of the most interesting sounds I'd never
heard! Props to Ed for out-doing himself again!

>LONDON (AP) -- People who use the illegal drug Ecstasy are putting themselves
>at risk of developing brain damage, according to a new study.
>
>Brain scans of 14 men and women who used the party drug show it damages the
>nerves that release serotonin, the chemical believed to play a role in mood,
>thought processes, eating and sleep, researchers at Johns Hopkins University
>Medical School have found.
>
>The damage occurred even with infrequent use and at typical doses of one or
>two tablets, but the more taken, the more severe the effects, according to the
>study, published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a British medical
>journal.
>
>And although some of the participants had not taken the drug for several
>years, their brain scans were not much better. None of the 14 had taken it
>within three weeks before their tests, the researchers say.
>
>Ecstasy, a hybrid of the hallucinogen mescaline and the stimulant amphetamine
>chemically known as MDMA, has been shown in previous studies to cause brain
>damage in animals at doses similar to those used by humans.
>
>In humans, tests have shown reduced levels of a serotonin byproduct,
>suggesting an indirect link between the drug and brain damage, the researchers
>say.
>
>``But this is the first time we've been able to examine the actual serotonin-
>producing nerve cells directly in the brain,'' said Dr. George Ricaurte, the
>neurologist who led the study.
>
>It is difficult to measure how widely Ecstasy is used because it is illegal.
>However, a survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found a four-fold
>increase between 1995 and 1996 in the number of Americans reporting they use
>the drug, Ricaurte said.
>
>Users report heightened communication skills, a sense of closeness with others
>and increased emotional awareness.
>
>In comparison with the 15 people studied who had never taken the drug, Ecstasy
>users had fewer serotonin transporters -- proteins embedded in the membranes
>of nerve endings that transmit nerve signals from one cell to another.
>
>Those lower levels suggest the drug destroys the nerve endings in the brain,
>Ricaurte said.
>
>``We've had lots of indirect evidence, but this goes right to the heart of
>it,'' said Dr. John Henry, a toxicologist at St. Mary's Hospital in London who
>was not involved in the study. ``Ecstasy is definitely neurotoxic for man.''
>
>Ricaurte said scientists do not know how many transporters the human brain can
>afford to lose before nerve-related psychiatric disorders such as depression,
>anxiety, memory disturbance, sleep abnormalities or other troubles start to
>occur.
>
>Ricaurte also said it is too early to tell whether the damage is permanent.
>
>But Jim O'Callaghan, a neurotoxicologist at the Centers for Disease Control
>and Prevention in Atlanta, was not impressed by the study.
>
>He does not dispute that the drug causes a reduction in the number of
>serotonin transporters, only that this is not evidence that the nerve endings
