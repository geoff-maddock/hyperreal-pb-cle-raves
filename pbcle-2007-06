Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

My brother-in-law, Jay is wanting to sell his two turntables (Numarks TTX1s)
and two cartridges (Numark Phat Tracks).  All equipement is only 1 year
old.  He lives just NE of Canton in Louisville.  If anyone is interested,
please shoot him an email to jmail8@yahoo.com.  I can't remember what he's
asking for them off hand, but I think it's less than $400, but I could be
wrong.

Werd, nice one, I passed this along to a Dub
list I belong to.
http://futuredub.tribe.net

Werd up on some Pitch black,
one of my favorite artists!

Check out my boy Nod's dubstep mix
http://www.touchsamadhi.com/blog/nod/dj_nod_inna_dubstep_stylee

Dubstep and Psydub are some of the sickest tunes out
right now!

Peace,

Shit.  I just realised last night that I uploaded the wrong mix DOH!

I usually listen to the stream after uploading but I didn't this time.

The real mix is here...

Stream = http://www.musicv2.com/stream.php?id=32982

Download = http://www.musicv2.com/download.php?id=32982

Those other links are deceased now.

Thanks.  It was ok, I just wanted to get more of my own tunes on it and I
had a few of the same blends on that one so I wasn't going to give it out.
If you like it then by all means listen to it!

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Jun 09                         BINARY                         Cleveland

1st Appearance in Cleveland!
Producer of Yoshitoshi's biggest hit "You are Sleeping" and Ibiza anthem 
"Flying Song."

Favored among the likes of Deep Dish, Danny Howells, James Holden, 
Hernan Cattaneo and Danny Tenaglia, this New York native has been 
influencing the world's underground dance scene since the early 90's.

While hes known for his progressive tribal house sounds, his roots are 
in hip-hop. He earned the name Quick Mix as a teenager when first wowing 
audiences with his turntablist skills. Not straying far from his 
background as a block party DJ growing up in Queens NY, he readily 
demonstrates those turntable skills with seamless mixing, creative 
layering and the clever use of acappellas, which often happen live and 
in the moment. Like his productions, expect his house sets to be unique, 
emotional and undeniable on the dance floor.

Notable productions include You Are Sleeping, "Flying Song", Nameless, 
"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You", Ill Be Your Friend and Aenema amongst many, 
many others. Sought after for his underground yet marketable sound, 
Quick has also been summoned to remix major label artists such as Sarah 
Mclachlan, Jimmy Page & Robert Plant, Robert Owens and BT, just to name 
a few. His music has also been requested for licensed use in The Crazy 
Frog Racer & Moto GP 2006.

Each year many A-List DJs from around the world license his songs for 
their compilations, such as Roger Sanchez, Hernan Cattaneo, The 
Timewriter, Peter Rauhofer, Dave Seaman & Phil K, James Holden, Deep 
Dish, John Creamer & Stephane K, and Kenny Dope Gonzalez.

Quick is one of the most talented producers out there who has the 
ability to think outside the box and continuously create fresh new event 
records. ~Ali & Sharam (Deep Dish)

PQM is someone I admire very much. His music has a dark & twisted side 
that can be downright scary at times, which, in my opinion, is a very 
good thing! ~Danny Howells

~ Stone Circle Stage: Psytrance & Progressive Trance ~

AMD
(Nano Records  UK)
Live! First North American appearance!
Presenting AMD, the Psytrance super-group consisting of the two solo 
artists APHID MOON and DICKSTER. With their complementary production 
skills and a shared love of full-on music, they make a formidable force, 
taking Psytrance to a new and exciting place, delivering nothing but 
floor-fillers with huge, multi-layered tracks that keeping building and 
peaking! Having already rocked dancefloors in Brazil, Japan, Europe, and 
the UK, in support of their debut album, Big Fish, we are fortunate to 
have them for their first USA appearance! Get ready all you lovers of 
dance!

DICKSTER / DICK TREVOR
(Nano Records  UK)
Live & DJ sets!
We are truly honored to host a Psytrance legend! DICK TREVOR has been at 
the forefront of the Psytrance scene since its conception -- responsible 
for seminal acts such as GREEN NUNS OF THE REVOLUTION, BUMBLING LOONS, 
SLINKY NUNS, INFERNAL MACHINE, TRICKSTER, BISTO BOYS, GREEN OMS, 
JUMANJI, and currently with DICKSTER and AMD. With unrivaled production 
talent, and countless releases to his name, experience what an 
undeniably experienced artist can do to a dancefloor!

APHID MOON
(Nano Records  UK)
Live! First North American appearance!
Over the last decade, APHID MOON has released on countless Psytrance 
labels and played numerous parties and festivals in Japan, Israel, South 
Africa, Brazil, Europe, and the UK. His hard-driving and infectious 
dance sound made of clear grooves and intense psychedelics stands out of 
the league of full-on you know already. His music is sharp and toxic 
enough to expand your boarders of dance experience - demanding your 
energy to create the dancefloors collective. This is Psychedelic Trance!

HUMAN BLUE
(Transient Records  Sweden)
Live!
Its been eight, long years since HUMAN BLUE first played in Philadelphia 
for GAIAN MIND, and in that time, hes been busy both touring around the 
globe and producing lots of tracks  testing and perfecting his signature 
sound consisting of delicately structured soundscapes, and harmonies 
backed up with a chunky groove. HUMAN BLUE has released five albums in 
his career so far, with a sixth album slated for this summer, and hes 
been licensed to no less then 80 (!) compilations, as well as releasing 
a number of 12 vinyl releases. Prepare yourself for what is sure to be a 
most memorable morning session!

LOOPUS IN FABULA
(Fabula Records  Italy)
Live!
We are happy to welcome back LOOPUS IN FABULA, who made a remarkable 
surprise appearance at GMSF2004. With three albums to his name, he has 
established a reputation for the funkadelic sound; a mixture of 
mind-twisting Psytrance and funky Disco sounds. Having played almost 
every corner of the world, LOOPUS has developed and perfected a blended, 
live + DJ set with a special task: slowly bringing the dancefloor into a 
relaxed, happy, funky atmosphere full of laughs and funny smiles!

YAB-YUM / GASPARD / AJJA
(Peak Records  Switzerland)
Live & DJ sets! Trance & Downtempo sets! First North American 
appearance!
AJJA and GASPARD, two musicians, two sets of creative energy, influenced 
by each other and fusing into a whole that is greater then the sum of 
its parts. As co-founders of Switzerlands Peak Records, they have their 
fingers on the pulse of the full-power, nighttime sounds. Get ready for 
a colorful nighttime journey filled with futuristic freakiness -- a 
swirling carousel of loops and rhythms, spastic elastic sounds and funky 
leads, balanced by rolling bass-lines and powerful kicks! We proudly 
present the North American debut of YAB-YUM!

PHUTUREPRIMITIVE / TELEPATHIK
(Liquid Records  Portland, OR)
Live & DJ! Downtempo & Trance sets!
PHUTUREPRIMITIVE has become a top artist in the Downtempo/Psy-Chill 
music scene, performing throughout the United States and Europe with his 
fusion of organic and synthetic elements. Musically ranging from 
atmospheric downbeat and Drum n Bass patterns, to ethnic breaks, vocals 
and percussions, to dub and beyond -- creating a landscape of aural 
texture. For a Psytrance project, TELEPATHIK is diverse in its sound, 
sometimes leaning towards a more progressive groove, sometimes melodic, 
while other times diving straight into a full-on driving frenzy -- 
always shifting and changing into new sounds and themes. This is dance 
music that takes both your mind and body on a journey!

LEILA
(Dragonfly Records  UK)
As a veteran of the early Goa scene and the UKs free party culture, 
Leila has played at festivals across Europe, Mexico, Brazil, and Zambia, 
including twice at Samothraki. Her tunes are plucked from a spectrum of 
psychedelia, never too progressive or minimalist. Leila seduces with her 
insistent grooves, funky basslines, and multi-layered melodies, often 
harboring a hard-edged, spring-loaded bite! She may be a waif, but this 
little lady sure packs a punch!

TECHNO!!!!!!

with...

SMASH TV (Berlin)

"now more than ever" seems to be the motto of holger zilske aka smash 
tv. after the every day life of an employee brought his companien 
michael schmidt to his knees regarding his musical activities and he 
therefore dropped out of smash tv, music came to the fore more and more 
for holger. since then it's him alone who stands for smash tv.

the list of his gigs is long: alicante, cork, london, rotterdam, 
hamburg, munchen, zurich, ljubljana, paris, lyon, brussel, berlin, 
madrid, malta, new york, san francisco, seattle, portland, texas, 
detroit, pittsburgh, chicago, rio de janeiro, sao paulo, basel, wismar, 
valencia, stuttgart, barcelona, dresden, leipzig, kassel, frankfurt, 
wien, glasgow, nurnberg, birmingham, minneapolis, bern und strasburg, 
where he rocked the house until dawn!

no breaks for him  if he is not playing he is in his studio working on 
new tracks. the result is  besides his albums electrified" and bits for 
breakfast" as well as several ep's and remixes his releases together 
with ellen allien, like stadtkind", berlinette" und thrills".

more than 80 songs are produced already and can be found on the 
turntables all around the world.

and of course there will be more in 2006. his first release of this year 
if air/earth", a 12". it will be followed by a single that's already 
finished. so get ready ... 2006 belongs to him ... don't change the 
channel!

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

I once danced a polka dance while bathing naked in a fountain of badger

The milk went into my nostrils.

Polkamilk.

I can't even tell you how I miss certain things about Cleveland that
just don't happen in Columbus. Like ethnic food that isn't
asian/indian or turkish.

I once danced a polka dance while bathing naked in a fountain of badger milk.
The milk went into my nostrils. Polkamilk.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Presenting the 6th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
~ Summer Solstice ~

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air  truly, a magical event which has quickly become an annual 
summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes! Now in its sixth year, 
the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted world-class international

Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the 
United Kingdom, plus the finest regional talent in the USA, becoming a

gathering includes a full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, 
lectures and workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and 
much more in a sacred, sylvan sanctuary that only Four Quarters can 
provide.

~ Stone Circle Stage: Psytrance & Progressive Trance ~

AMD
(Nano Records  UK)
Live! First North American appearance!
Presenting AMD, the Psytrance super-group consisting of the two solo 
artists APHID MOON and DICKSTER. With their complementary production 
skills and a shared love of full-on music, they make a formidable force, 
taking Psytrance to a new and exciting place, delivering nothing but 
floor-fillers with huge, multi-layered tracks that keeping building and 
peaking! Having already rocked dancefloors in Brazil, Japan, Europe, and 
the UK, in support of their debut album, Big Fish, we are fortunate to 
have them for their first USA appearance! Get ready all you lovers of 
dance!

DICKSTER / DICK TREVOR
(Nano Records  UK)
Live & DJ sets!
We are truly honored to host a Psytrance legend! DICK TREVOR has been at 
the forefront of the Psytrance scene since its conception -- responsible 
for seminal acts such as GREEN NUNS OF THE REVOLUTION, BUMBLING LOONS, 
SLINKY NUNS, INFERNAL MACHINE, TRICKSTER, BISTO BOYS, GREEN OMS, 
JUMANJI, and currently with DICKSTER and AMD. With unrivaled production 
talent, and countless releases to his name, experience what an 
undeniably experienced artist can do to a dancefloor!

APHID MOON
(Nano Records  UK)
Live! First North American appearance!
Over the last decade, APHID MOON has released on countless Psytrance 
labels and played numerous parties and festivals in Japan, Israel, South 
Africa, Brazil, Europe, and the UK. His hard-driving and infectious 
dance sound made of clear grooves and intense psychedelics stands out of 
the league of full-on you know already. His music is sharp and toxic 
enough to expand your boarders of dance experience - demanding your 
energy to create the dancefloors collective. This is Psychedelic Trance!

HUMAN BLUE
(Transient Records  Sweden)
Live!
Its been eight, long years since HUMAN BLUE first played in Philadelphia 
for GAIAN MIND, and in that time, hes been busy both touring around the 
globe and producing lots of tracks  testing and perfecting his signature 
sound consisting of delicately structured soundscapes, and harmonies 
backed up with a chunky groove. HUMAN BLUE has released five albums in 
his career so far, with a sixth album slated for this summer, and hes 
been licensed to no less then 80 (!) compilations, as well as releasing 
a number of 12 vinyl releases. Prepare yourself for what is sure to be a 
most memorable morning session!

LOOPUS IN FABULA
(Fabula Records  Italy)
Live!
We are happy to welcome back LOOPUS IN FABULA, who made a remarkable 
surprise appearance at GMSF2004. With three albums to his name, he has 
established a reputation for the funkadelic sound; a mixture of 
mind-twisting Psytrance and funky Disco sounds. Having played almost 
every corner of the world, LOOPUS has developed and perfected a blended, 
live + DJ set with a special task: slowly bringing the dancefloor into a 
relaxed, happy, funky atmosphere full of laughs and funny smiles!

YAB-YUM / GASPARD / AJJA
(Peak Records  Switzerland)
Live & DJ sets! Trance & Downtempo sets! First North American 
appearance!
AJJA and GASPARD, two musicians, two sets of creative energy, influenced 
by each other and fusing into a whole that is greater then the sum of 
its parts. As co-founders of Switzerlands Peak Records, they have their 
fingers on the pulse of the full-power, nighttime sounds. Get ready for 
a colorful nighttime journey filled with futuristic freakiness -- a 
swirling carousel of loops and rhythms, spastic elastic sounds and funky 
leads, balanced by rolling bass-lines and powerful kicks! We proudly 
present the North American debut of YAB-YUM!

PHUTUREPRIMITIVE / TELEPATHIK
(Liquid Records  Portland, OR)
Live & DJ! Downtempo & Trance sets!
PHUTUREPRIMITIVE has become a top artist in the Downtempo/Psy-Chill 
music scene, performing throughout the United States and Europe with his 
fusion of organic and synthetic elements. Musically ranging from 
atmospheric downbeat and Drum n Bass patterns, to ethnic breaks, vocals 
and percussions, to dub and beyond -- creating a landscape of aural 
texture. For a Psytrance project, TELEPATHIK is diverse in its sound, 
sometimes leaning towards a more progressive groove, sometimes melodic, 
while other times diving straight into a full-on driving frenzy -- 
always shifting and changing into new sounds and themes. This is dance 
music that takes both your mind and body on a journey!

LEILA
(Dragonfly Records  UK)
As a veteran of the early Goa scene and the UKs free party culture, 
Leila has played at festivals across Europe, Mexico, Brazil, and Zambia, 
including twice at Samothraki. Her tunes are plucked from a spectrum of 
psychedelia, never too progressive or minimalist. Leila seduces with her 
insistent grooves, funky basslines, and multi-layered melodies, often 
harboring a hard-edged, spring-loaded bite! She may be a waif, but this 
little lady sure packs a punch!

SMASH TV (Berlin)

"now more than ever" seems to be the motto of holger zilske aka smash 
tv. after the every day life of an employee brought his companien 
michael schmidt to his knees regarding his musical activities and he 
therefore dropped out of smash tv, music came to the fore more and more 
for holger. since then it's him alone who stands for smash tv.

the list of his gigs is long: alicante, cork, london, rotterdam, 
hamburg, munchen, zurich, ljubljana, paris, lyon, brussel, berlin, 
madrid, malta, new york, san francisco, seattle, portland, texas, 
detroit, pittsburgh, chicago, rio de janeiro, sao paulo, basel, wismar, 
valencia, stuttgart, barcelona, dresden, leipzig, kassel, frankfurt, 
wien, glasgow, nurnberg, birmingham, minneapolis, bern und strasburg, 
where he rocked the house until dawn!

no breaks for him  if he is not playing he is in his studio working on 
new tracks. the result is  besides his albums electrified" and bits for 
breakfast" as well as several ep's and remixes his releases together 
with ellen allien, like stadtkind", berlinette" und thrills".

more than 80 songs are produced already and can be found on the 
turntables all around the world.

and of course there will be more in 2006. his first release of this year 
if air/earth", a 12". it will be followed by a single that's already 
finished. so get ready ... 2006 belongs to him ... don't change the 
channel!

***** VENUE Change *****

after serious contemplation we have decided to change venues. our motivation in making this change was primarily based on 
geographic location. the new venue is easier to access via major highways and the overall vibe of the location and venue 
owner was inspiring:

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

If anyone's reading this (on this list) coming from east on rt. 70,
note the directions have changed slightly to provide a shorter route.
(68 to x68 instead of 70 to Warfordsburg).

http://kotaku.com/gaming/oddities/games-hidden-in-the-grooves-of-lps-270155.php

really weird.... the articles have a picture of one of them in action, 
the other a picture of one of the records

-----------------------------------------------------

Video games hidden in the grooves of LPs

In the early personal computer days, recording artists included hidden 
computer programs on vinyl records -- you recorded the LP to tape, then 
put the tape in your computer's cassette drive. Here's a nice history of 
the practice, with screenshots of the programs in action and links to 
emulated versions.

A gigantic step up from encoded text files were actual games included in 
the grooves of records. In 1984, The Thompson Twins released 'The 
Thompson Twins Adventure Game' in both regular vinyl and flexi disc formats.

This one has survived the ravages of time and is available for download 
online. You can play it in your web browser by clicking this link. The 
game is a bizarre text-based adventure in which you guide the Thompson 
Twins around a land of beaches and caves. If you didn't grow up playing 
these games, in which you have to keep a map on paper and guess which 
key verbs the programmers used for certain actions, you may find it a 
bit frustrating. I poked around a little, but I haven't played it enough 
to see how it ends. If you go north from the first screen, the Thompson 
Twins drown en masse. As always, the British say it best: "And, what a 
surprise, having deafened my family recording it onto tape on our dodgy 
stereo, when the game finally worked, it was crap. Bloody stupid 
Eighties floppy haired innumerate Chesterfield talentless ponces."

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

other promoters.

Presenting AMD, the Psytrance super-group consisting of the two solo 
artists APHID MOON and DICKSTER. With their complementary production 
skills and a shared love of full-on music, they make a formidable force, 
taking Psytrance to a new and exciting place, delivering nothing but 
floor-fillers with huge, multi-layered tracks that keeping building and 
peaking! Having already rocked dancefloors in Brazil, Japan, Europe, and 
the UK, in support of their debut album, Big Fish, we are fortunate to 
have them for their first USA appearance! Get ready all you lovers of 
dance!

DICKSTER / DICK TREVOR
(Nano Records  UK)
Live & DJ sets!
We are truly honored to host a Psytrance legend! DICK TREVOR has been at 
the forefront of the Psytrance scene since its conception -- responsible 
for seminal acts such as GREEN NUNS OF THE REVOLUTION, BUMBLING LOONS, 
SLINKY NUNS, INFERNAL MACHINE, TRICKSTER, BISTO BOYS, GREEN OMS, 
JUMANJI, and currently with DICKSTER and AMD. With unrivaled production 
talent, and countless releases to his name, experience what an 
undeniably experienced artist can do to a dancefloor!

APHID MOON
(Nano Records  UK)
Live! First North American appearance!
Over the last decade, APHID MOON has released on countless Psytrance 
labels and played numerous parties and festivals in Japan, Israel, South 
Africa, Brazil, Europe, and the UK. His hard-driving and infectious 
dance sound made of clear grooves and intense psychedelics stands out of 
the league of full-on you know already. His music is sharp and toxic 
enough to expand your boarders of dance experience - demanding your 
energy to create the dancefloors collective. This is Psychedelic Trance!

HUMAN BLUE
(Transient Records  Sweden)
Live!
Its been eight, long years since HUMAN BLUE first played in Philadelphia 
for GAIAN MIND, and in that time, hes been busy both touring around the 
globe and producing lots of tracks  testing and perfecting his signature 
sound consisting of delicately structured soundscapes, and harmonies 
backed up with a chunky groove. HUMAN BLUE has released five albums in 
his career so far, with a sixth album slated for this summer, and hes 
been licensed to no less then 80 (!) compilations, as well as releasing 
a number of 12 vinyl releases. Prepare yourself for what is sure to be a 
most memorable morning session!

LOOPUS IN FABULA
(Fabula Records  Italy)
Live!
We are happy to welcome back LOOPUS IN FABULA, who made a remarkable 
surprise appearance at GMSF2004. With three albums to his name, he has 
established a reputation for the funkadelic sound; a mixture of 
mind-twisting Psytrance and funky Disco sounds. Having played almost 
every corner of the world, LOOPUS has developed and perfected a blended, 
live + DJ set with a special task: slowly bringing the dancefloor into a 
relaxed, happy, funky atmosphere full of laughs and funny smiles!

YAB-YUM / GASPARD / AJJA
(Peak Records  Switzerland)
Live & DJ sets! Trance & Downtempo sets! First North American 
appearance!
AJJA and GASPARD, two musicians, two sets of creative energy, influenced 
by each other and fusing into a whole that is greater then the sum of 
its parts. As co-founders of Switzerlands Peak Records, they have their 
fingers on the pulse of the full-power, nighttime sounds. Get ready for 
a colorful nighttime journey filled with futuristic freakiness -- a 
swirling carousel of loops and rhythms, spastic elastic sounds and funky 
leads, balanced by rolling bass-lines and powerful kicks! We proudly 
present the North American debut of YAB-YUM!

PHUTUREPRIMITIVE / TELEPATHIK
(Liquid Records  Portland, OR)
Live & DJ! Downtempo & Trance sets!
PHUTUREPRIMITIVE has become a top artist in the Downtempo/Psy-Chill 
music scene, performing throughout the United States and Europe with his 
fusion of organic and synthetic elements. Musically ranging from 
atmospheric downbeat and Drum n Bass patterns, to ethnic breaks, vocals 
and percussions, to dub and beyond -- creating a landscape of aural 
texture. For a Psytrance project, TELEPATHIK is diverse in its sound, 
sometimes leaning towards a more progressive groove, sometimes melodic, 
while other times diving straight into a full-on driving frenzy -- 
always shifting and changing into new sounds and themes. This is dance 
music that takes both your mind and body on a journey!

LEILA
(Dragonfly Records  UK)
As a veteran of the early Goa scene and the UKs free party culture, 
Leila has played at festivals across Europe, Mexico, Brazil, and Zambia, 
including twice at Samothraki. Her tunes are plucked from a spectrum of 
psychedelia, never too progressive or minimalist. Leila seduces with her 
insistent grooves, funky basslines, and multi-layered melodies, often 
harboring a hard-edged, spring-loaded bite! She may be a waif, but this 
little lady sure packs a punch!

TECHNO!!!!!!

with...

SMASH TV (Berlin)

"now more than ever" seems to be the motto of holger zilske aka smash 
tv. after the every day life of an employee brought his companien 
michael schmidt to his knees regarding his musical activities and he 
therefore dropped out of smash tv, music came to the fore more and more 
for holger. since then it's him alone who stands for smash tv.

the list of his gigs is long: alicante, cork, london, rotterdam, 
hamburg, munchen, zurich, ljubljana, paris, lyon, brussel, berlin, 
madrid, malta, new york, san francisco, seattle, portland, texas, 
detroit, pittsburgh, chicago, rio de janeiro, sao paulo, basel, wismar, 
valencia, stuttgart, barcelona, dresden, leipzig, kassel, frankfurt, 
wien, glasgow, nurnberg, birmingham, minneapolis, bern und strasburg, 
where he rocked the house until dawn!

no breaks for him  if he is not playing he is in his studio working on 
new tracks. the result is  besides his albums electrified" and bits for 
breakfast" as well as several ep's and remixes his releases together 
with ellen allien, like stadtkind", berlinette" und thrills".

more than 80 songs are produced already and can be found on the 
turntables all around the world.

and of course there will be more in 2006. his first release of this year 
if air/earth", a 12". it will be followed by a single that's already 
finished. so get ready ... 2006 belongs to him ... don't change the 
channel!

***** VENUE Change *****

after serious contemplation we have decided to change venues. our motivation in making this change was primarily based on 
geographic location. the new venue is easier to access via major highways and the overall vibe of the location and venue 
owner was inspiring:

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} whats on your vinyl?

mad magazine had the mad mystery record that has i think 5 different 
endings.    i guess the groove splits up at some point?

there are also lock groove records that basically play a measure 
endlessly.  i have an ectomorph record that has a DIY remix kit on it 
with 10 loops from one of the songs on it.  i guess get 2 copies and 
have at it.

I remember looking for records at one point and came across the parallel
groove ones.  Forget what record label did a bunch of them (some detroit
label IIRC).  That would suck if the needle skips the groove, or maybe
it would sound good if both tracks were beatmatched.

have a few lock grooves, including winx - don't laugh that just, well,
laughs, forever.  Def not one you'd want to have playing and then fall
asleep :)

well lock grooves have to be 133 bpm (assuming you're playing 33 rpm)

i've seen lock groove records that have like 50 loops on each side, all 
are perfectly matched so you can hop from groove to groove and they will 
be locked in.  its really neat when you have 2 of these and jump around 
on both.

<<well lock grooves have to be 133 bpm (assuming you're playing 33 rpm)>>

that was the thing that always struck me as being limiting about those
types of records...it only seemed to be good for techno, which was
never my milieu of choice.

unless, of course, you had some really leftfield shit that didn't use
a standard 4/4 time structure....i'd assume there's some sort of
mathematical equation that could help you figure it out, but i'm not
that guy....

<<i've seen lock groove records that have like 50 loops on each side, all

didn't DJ Hell use something like that...where he could essentially
lift the needle and drop it somewhere else on the record and it would
still be in-beat?

i seem to remember seeing him do that in some video or other, and it
freaked me out...

A friend of my grandmother passed away recently and they're liquidating
what was in her house.  This was in the basement.  Only information I've
 found so far is it's made by the Ganby Phonograph Company, which
existed between 1920 and 1923.  Had about 6 records and they're all
slovakian and polka or something.  Going to checkout the goodwill nearby
for anything good.  Video doesn't really show it well (was taken from my
digital camera) but the sound quality is really good, sounds like what
you hear on carousels :)  Unfortunately the video is a little darker
than I thought it would be.  Anyways I plan on trying to preserve it as
best as I can.  This was litterally as soon as we got home, I quickly
hit it with canned air to get out some of the cobwebs, wound it up,
changed the needle, and played it.

I don't want to imagine the tracking weight on these.  To give you an
idea, you are supposed to change the needle after every record.  And if
you look at the needle afterwards you can see why.  And at first we were
trying to figure out why it came with a pack of like 50 or so needles.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: Old phonograph player from 1920s

The wife and I for our 1st wedding anniversary went where we could  
get a baby sitter (my mom's temporary place in parkersburg wv).  
Having not much to do, we went to as many antique places as possible,  
which was quite a few. There had to be one on almost every block,  
given that a block is 20 miles there. I was amazed at the amount of  
really really old school record players we found there. The average  
shop had 5-6 for $150-$250 a pop, when the wood cases they were in  
were easily worth 2x that given the shape. I was half tempted to pick  
up one of the cheaper ones and drop one of the TTX-1's in my basement  
in it, but alas, I have a child and such things aren't in the budget.  
There were also a bunch of old radios begging for a PC/iPod back end  
with a touch screen or something, at about half that price, but...  
diapers and all.

Some of the cooler things you can find in such places are electric  
and pump organs (I've got your pump organ right here), various old  
instruments, and lots of other things that make noise. Price-wise,  
they're much less than you'd find in second hand music stores,  
totally worth checking out if that's your thing.

I once danced a polka dance while bathing naked in a fountain of badger milk.
The milk went into my nostrils. Polkamilk.

Yeah I have no idea how much this is worth, or even where I'll put it (I
said I was the one that wanted it).  My parents have an antique room
that we may put it in once it gets cleaned up.  I really have no idea
how much this is worth ("antiques roadshow" material) but all the inner
workings seemed to be in really good shape.  Reading up on it I found a
FAQ that talks about maintenance on these and there are a lot of things
that have a warning "be careful or you will lose a finger" becaause of
the spring that's inside there.  When mother first mentioned the player
I thought it had the big horn off the top.  And she said that if that
was the case it would have been the first thing they got :)

And as far as old radios go, we got one of those too.  Sounds fine and
it's interesting they're still broadcasting on those other frequencies,
at leas a few years ago when we had it plugged in.

Thanks, I'll send you an email off-list once I get some pictures and a
brighter video taken.  I purposely had this video darker because I took
the brightness from further away so I could pan around the cabinet or
else it would be overexposed if I took it out of where it was playing.
I asked for help on a usenet group about old phonographs and radios
[sic] and already got a few responses.  Aside from the obvious "you
should clean it before playing anything" to tips on how to clean out the
motor and spring assembly (which FAQ's clearly state to be careful or
you can chop off your fingers).  The internet is actually useful for
more than just porn, imagine that.  I'll probably start working on
cleaning it up tonight, at the very least loosen up the "headshell"
(since I keep forgetting the correct name) so that it moves freely.  I
looked at it a little bit this morning and it looks pretty simple to
take apart most things with a flathead screwdriver.  No weird spanners
or anything like you need for the 1200s.  Don't even need to be near a
wall outlet :)

Taken from the * soma.fm *webpage:

Today is the Day of Silence at SomaFM.

The future of Internet radio is in immediate danger. Royalty rates for
webcasters have been drastically increased by a recent ruling and are due to
go into effect on July 15 (retroactive to Jan 1, 2006!). SomaFM will be
liable for $600,000 in additional royalties for 2006, and over $500,000 for
the first half of 2007. As of July 15th, we will owe $1.1 million dollars in
additional royalties.

To protest these rates and encourage you to take action and contact your
iCongressional representatives, we are taking part in the Day of Silence, by
silencing our programming for today.

All of us at SomaFM ask that you excuse the interruption of our normal
broadcasts, and ask that you take action to help ensure this silence is not
permanent. Please call your Congressional Representatives today. We make it
easy, and it will only take a few minutes. If you've already called your
representative, please call them again and ask them why they're not
supporting independent internet radio.

So far, 860 people have clicked that link to contact their congressmen.
Let's see if we can get that up to 10,000 people today!

A Day of Silence

Hi, it's Tim from Pandora,

I'm sorry to say that today Pandora, along with most Internet radio sites,
is going off the air in observance of a Day Of Silence. We are doing this to
bring to your attention a disastrous turn of events that threatens the
existence of Pandora and all of internet radio. We need your help.

Ignoring all rationality and responding only to the lobbying of the RIAA, an
arbitration committee in Washington DC has drastically increased the
licensing fees Internet radio sites must pay to stream songs. Pandora's fees
will triple, and are retroactive for eighteen months! Left unchanged by
Congress, every day will be like today as internet radio sites start
shutting down and the music dies.

A bill called the "Internet Radio Equality Act" has already been introduced
in both the Senate (S. 1353) and House of Representatives (H.R. 2060) to fix
the problem and save Internet radio--and Pandora--from obliteration.

I'd like to ask you to call your Congressional representatives today and ask
them to become co-sponsors of the bill. It will only take a few minutes and
you can find your Congresspersons and their phone numbers by entering your
zip code here
<http://www3.capwiz.com/saveinternetradio/issues/alert/?alertid=9738601>.

Your opinion matters to your representatives - so please take just a minute
to call.

Visit www.savenetradio.org to continue following the fight to Save Internet
Radio.

As always, and now more than ever, thank you for your support.



This could be really bad for you if you enjoy commercial free online radio.

wow, this is so fucked i can't even comprehend it.  I guess this is a 
reason to farm your hosting out to one of those small islands that 
has been declared a micronation beyond international treaties.

Do they REALLY think these little webradio places are going to pay? 
how out of touch.  we should just call it "pirate as much music as 
you possibly can" day to give a proper middle finger to the RIAA and 
the associated lawyers, who are really the ones making money.

Damn, if I could live with myself, I should go back to school to be 
an intellectual property lawyer.  I don't know that I could stand to 
look at my reflection every morning in my Sub Zero refrigerator and 
Bentley though.

Thanks for the reminder, Dean.

I was all set to upload my weekly podcast until i saw this email...even
though i'm not a traditional webcaster, I'm going to wait until 6/27 as a
gesture of solidarity with sites like Soma.fm (which i absolutely love).

This legislation is a great example of the death-rattle of the monstrous
music business machine. The folks who are collecting a check don't care who
they have to screw to keep collecting...and they don't realize that they're
"setting the barn on fire to try to save the horses".

Wasn't there some news story about Yahoo!, Real and someone else  
submitting a bill for $1,000,000,000,000 to the RIAA for them  
submitting play statistics in retaliation for the bills? AOL, Yahoo!,  
etc actually stand to lose a whole lot more than Soma (I <3 boot liquor)

I once danced a polka dance while bathing naked in a fountain of badger milk.
The milk went into my nostrils. Polkamilk.

Heh, I completely missed this.  I've been listening to etn.fm a lot
lately and apparently they didn't take part in this.  Yeah with every
new "revision" of the bill I've been contacting my local congress
people.  The whole thing seems ridiculous.  A lot of these stations are
playing artists that aren't even part of the RIAA, and apparently that
doesn't matter.  There are other stations that I know have started from
a clean slate and only played tracks that they can get the artist to
sign off and say that it can be played royalty free, even if they're an
independent artist.  Although from the sound of things that doesn't matter.

For the curious, I recorded a second video.  This time after cleaning
the cabinet, getting it in the house, and oiling the the joint where the
reproducer (the thing the needle is attached to) meets the tonearm so it
swivels freely.  Basically how I had it before where I had to push it on
the record was... umm... not correct.  Plus now it will follow the other
 records which are warped unfortunately.  Most of the records were in
this record book that was inside and tilted at an angle.  The one that I
played and that I liked the most was on the turntable itself and is
hardly warped at all.  This video is the other side of that record

My camera is teh ghey and only records up to 3 mins at a time.  Now I
took pictures and going to get to work fixing it up.  All the clanks and
grinds you hear are from the spring inside as it gets cought up in the
lubricant which consists of 9 parts vaseline and one part graphite... no
wonder it's all gunked up.  Also took some pictures I can send to people
that may be able to help id it, offer help on fixing it up, etc.

I'm wondering if you can dewarp records the way they are showing how
to warp them... a few weights and some oven time mgiht restore one or
two records for your listening enjoyment?

really worth anything but ymmv... it may be some rare item.

yes, this has been done, put a record between 2 heavy plates of glass 
and sit in the sun, watch it closely and when they get near normal you 
can take it out of the sun.

the record should still be flattening out at this point. keep watching it.

when it gets flat put it in a freezer or cool water--while still between 
the glass plates.

never tried it. only have one badly warped record and it sounds fine and 
i dont dj with it (southern culture on the skids)

thats how it was explained to me by a dj long ago that claims to have 
done it.  YMMV, and i'd test it out on crappage first before your 
original model 500 records...

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

***** VENUE Change *****

after serious contemplation we have decided to change venues. our motivation in making this change was primarily based on 
geographic location. the new venue is easier to access via major highways and the overall vibe of the location and venue 
owner was inspiring:

Jul 13-14                 HULLA 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY                 Toronto

http://www.hulla.info/board/showthread.php?t=23548&page=1&pp=25

HULLABALOO MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY WITH WEEKEND CELEBRATION

Highlights Include World Premiere of Feature Documentary and One-Off 
Reunion Party.


....TORONTO. Seminal rave production company Hullabaloo will be marking 
its historic start in 1997 with a theatrical screening of a feature 
documentary and special one-off reunion party on the weekend of July 
13th & 14th, 2007. The celebration will begin on Friday July 13th with 
the world premiere of Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle, to be capped off 
on Saturday July 14th with a return to its legendary home at the Opera 
House in Toronto.

.....I.ve always wanted to cement Hulla.s history and legacy with a 
special documentary project, and as we approach what will be the 10th 
anniversary of its creation it became a synergistic date to hold it.s 
premiere,. said Hullabaloo founder Chris Frolic.

....Hullabaloo is regarded by many around the world as a high water mark 
of electronic dance events (or as they were better known in the 90.s, 
raves). Hullabaloo.s hallmark was one of the most dedicated, colorful, 
and enthusiastic group of patrons ever assembled in one place, 
affectionately referred to as .Hulla Ravers..

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle tells the human story of how many 
lives were forever changed over its historic 8 year run. Interviews with 
many of the DJs, MCs and Hulla Ravers who made Hullabaloo what it was 
are featured as well as incredible footage from its entire history, and 
a blistering soundtrack comprised of the cutting edge underground 
electronic music for which Hulla was famous. It.s a one of a kind 
experience, just like the events themselves.

.....There.s so little left to mark that decade, it seems. Countless 
promoters and history are just completely erased from memory. Hullabaloo 
was so special to so many people, I.m thrilled that for generations to 
come they.ll be able to look back on this and get a taste of what it was 
all about,. said Frolic.

....A reunion party was never part of the original plans, said a 
reluctant Frolic. .I never imagined that we.d be doing it again, but it 
didn.t make sense to mark the release of our film in any other way. The 
other thing was that I.ve received several hundred emails from fans all 
over the world who never had a chance to attend a Hulla the first 
go-round, so this is their once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of 
something so significant..

....Hullabaloo has a long history of sold-out events and tickets are 
expected to sell out extremely fast for this historic weekend. .The 
legend that is Hullabaloo has only grown over the past two years since 
our final event. Nothing like it exists anymore and it.s exciting to 
have the chance to do it one more time. Not only will the original Hulla 
Ravers be coming out to see some familiar faces and take a trip down 
memory lane, but so will an entire generation of electronic music fans 
who have only heard the stories and never had the opportunity themselves 
. until now,. said Frolic.

....The reunion party also marks the return to Hullabaloo.s hallowed 
home at the Opera House in Toronto. .There was really no question if we 
were to do this, where it should be held,. Frolic said. .The Opera House 
was as big a part of Hulla as anything else and it will be a tremendous 
feeling to walk through those doors again, knowing what the night 
holds..

....Full details for the party will be released at a later date, but 
Frolic promised it will be a fitting tribute. .My theme for planning it 
is .Summer 1999., as that was arguably our very own .Summer of Love.. 
The rave scene saw such an incredible peak during that summer, and 
things would never be the same as the millennium drew to a close. Our 
movie and this party are a celebration of those days when we thought we 
might actually change the world. So this party is for those who were a 
part of that incredible period, as well as those who weren.t there but 
will forever carry that magical time in their spirit..

....Frolic asserted that this is a one-time deal. .With the documentary 
to celebrate, I couldn.t say no to doing it one more time. But I 
wouldn.t hold my breath waiting for a follow-up. Well, maybe in another 
10 years,. he said with a laugh.

....Hullabaloo! A Raving Chronicle will debut with a private screening 
in Toronto on Friday July 13th, and the yet-to-be-named reunion party on 
Saturday July 14th. The official movie poster and party flyer will be 
posted at www.hulla.info. Tickets for both will go on sale Monday March 
5th.

....Hullabaloo is one of the most prolific rave promotion companies in 
the world. 44 events were held over eight years, most of which sold out 
completely in advance and were attended by patrons from all over the 
world.

....Chris Frolic is better known to hundreds of thousands of fans under 
his DJ alias, Anabolic Frolic. Besides being the founder of Hullabaloo, 
his HAPPY2bHARDCORE series remains the best selling electronic music 
series of all time in North America.

Jul 20-22                  THE CAVEMAN EXPERIENCE              Eminence, MO

We've decided to move the event to a much larger and better venue.

It's the best venue that the midwest has ever seen. Hands down.

It even has caves that you can actually go into

A crystal clear spring fed creek for swimming

and over 330 acres.

Located in The Ozark National Scenic Riverways and The Pioneer Forest 
are adjoining and surrounding this property. The small resort town of 
Eminence, MO is 14 miles south of this location on Hwy 19. This town 
hosts bluegrass festivals, cross country trail rides, hotels, 
restaurants, and has several canoe rental operations for floating on the 
Current River and Jack's Fork rivers. The larger city of Salem, MO is 28 
miles north of Zoe and has a super Wal-mart, hotels, a hospital, 
McDonalds, etc.....

The venue is absolutely amazing. There are swimmin' holes, beaches, 
hiking trails, caves, bathrooms, showers, natural springs, scenic bluffs 
and lots of shaded camping.

A nice added feature of this event, that has been exceptionally 
problematic at other events over the past couple years is that you will 
be allowed to park your car by your tent. So if you're like me, and you 
usually bring a tent for your friends and end up sleeping in your car, 
you'll be allowed to sleep in your car.

Other features of this new venue include:

A stocked fishing pond (catch and release)
3 CAMPING SECTIONS
4 MILES OF INTERNAL GRAVEL ROADS
1 1/2 MILES OF SPRING-FED STREAM THROUGH MIDDLE OF THE VENUE
5 BEACHES
5 SWIMMIN' HOLES - 3 ft. to 8 ft. deep clear water
2 PEDESTRIAN WALK BRIDGES OVER STREAM
2 CAVES
7000 PEOPLE CAPACITY - with cars & tents
1 ATM
1 PAY PHONE
1 GENERAL STORE
1 CONCESSION STAND WITH LIQUOR LICENSE
100 CANOES - provided by local outfitters
4 SCHOOL BUSSES - for canoe shuttles provided by local outfitters
20 to 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO CLOSEST TOWNS
1 SHOWER HOUSE (3 stalls on each side with new water heaters)
420 TRASH BARRELS (55 gallon)
3 TRASH DUMPSTERS
53 PORTA-JONS
1 BATHROOM HOUSE (6 toilets)

Yeah i've thought of that.  But they do still play for the most part,
guess warpage isn't a problem when you have several ounces of tracking
weight on them :)

There's a victrolla tabletop one that was very common.  I think the
original price wasn't really expensive and it sits on the desk so it's
really portable.  You can see find them on ebay all the time.  looks
like they're going between 100-250 on the auctions I've watched.  Yeah I
don't plan on selling it, I just think it looks cool.  I just want to
get it all fixed up so it will last another 90 years as long as we don't
nuke ourselves into oblivion before then.

define nuke?

irradiating ourselves with global warming / ozone depletion already
occurring.

i'd have to say that it's pretty funny that as far as oil reserves go,
they're probably going to run out about the same time that there isnt
anything left to our atmosphere.

so we can just keep driving and in about 30ish years it will melt on its
own, without need for a nuclear detonation.

sorry, forgot 'you people' like the term "Climate Change"

and global warming is not just one meme.  it's the generalized term for the
collection of many different aspects that all contribute to positive climate
change.

the pittsburgh zoo currently has a polar bear exhibit going on... i'd
suggest going since they magically lost 12 weeks of their feeding season
over the past 10 years due to "climate change" and who knows how much longer
they'll be around naturally.

while you're there, jump in the tank, i've heard they're really cuddly.
