i was wondering the exact same thing ... though if it was @ the irish center 
I wish they would say so at the beginning of the message as a lot of
people know where it is ... and wouldn't have to site through the dir.

okay..simple questions with ambiguous answers.
what constitutes a publically occupied building?
full of public people? full of private people?
what the fuck is the difference? also,
certainly, most bars and clubs are privately owned.
accprding to civil rights laws, they must adhere to rules set forth to
increase tolerance and decrease discrimination....
But how, in americas own corporate politically dimented minds, can anyone,
even if its the FCC, tell privately owned night clubs whats illegal to
promote through their systems?
     We have the choice to hear it. we make that choice by entering the
privately owned facility, so it can hardly be considered a broadcast.
     As far as i know, all rules and regulations must adhere to the
constitution of the united states of america, and i believe its about time
copyright laws that promote censorship for moral and royalty seeking
purposes, like the ones discussed on this list, are completely paradoxical;
It seems as though political correctness can only be correctly defined
through what isnt correct. (i.e. good=not bad becuz AND thus bad=not good);
this circular logic is driving me insane and completely nocturnal.:P
     The worst part about it is when u discuss these types of issues only
with logic, it IS endless...infinite and useless..

     the main difference between selling other peoples music and charging
admission at a club for playing the same music, regardless of the source,
is the fact that in a club you are selling an environment, an atmosphere,
an ambience, and on a mixtape of someones performance, youre selling a non
changing representation of this vibe. how these two are confused in
copyright laws is actually unlawful....

enough of this rebellion crap for now..gots to get some sleep+)

Hey everyone.  Sorry to bring up something OT but I trust this little
community and I could use some advice.  

I'm in Philly @ the moment (as some of you know) but I'm seriously
considering spending the summer in Pgh, where I lived for 3 years ending
in August.  The missing link is a job.

Ideally, I'd love to work for a local Internet access provider, ala
Telerama or something and I was wondering if anyone knew specifically of
places that are hiring or would benefit from extra hands.  Barring that,
I'd like some kind of computer-oriented job for someone with medium
skills, a bachelor's degree, and one hell of a work ethic.  

I can and would do a lot of things, not just computer-related, including
writing, things that require Spanish and/or Portuguese language skills,
musical knowledge, etc.  I guess I'm basically asking if anyone knows of
places that need honest, hard-working, fast-learning people who can be
very consistent, but don't mind lots of variety or change or being shifted
around to different projects.  Basically, I'm smart, flexible, and I need
a job, preferably one where I'm actually needed, and hopefully not bored
to tears. I'm checking the classifieds and net resources and stuff,
but lots of times it's best just to ask the people around you.  

Thanks a lot.  :)  :)

pete, thanks for the attitude-i dont make, nor enforce the laws, just
stating a few facts.  anyhow, yes, most bars are publically owned _BUT_
they dont own the music.  read the inserts on most major label stuff and it
will say BMI or ASCAP.  go to http://bmi.com/ ::::
:>BMI is a non-profit making organization representing more than 180,000 
:>songwriters, composers, and music publishers with a repertoire of more than

further down the page :::::
:>Visit our information section to access the bmi.com informational service 
:>with information about BMI, about songwriting and the music
:>business, and about how BMI music performance agreements serve public 
:>performance licensing needs. 
__notice .. PUBLIC PERFORMANCE LICENSING NEEDS
at alot of bars that play by the rules you will see a little blue sticker
that say BMI something or other and ASCAP something or other.  that costs a
buttload of $$$ for the _RIGHT_ to _PUBLICLY_ play _OTHER_PEOPLES_MUSIC_ at
least BMI or ASCAP music.

i dunno, but as a musician, i would like to get paid for the music i make,
no matter how sucky it is.  i mean, i have a few thousand dollars worth of

using someone else's _COPYRIGHTED_ materials for your own personal gain,

you made a few tracks, hit it big and i decided, hell, lets make 100000

---------------------------------------------------

youre absolutely correct, but this is not what i was talking about... maybe
i didnt qualify myself. copyright laws portaining to distribution of
_Static_ art are neccessary and logical. but laws portaining to royalties
of someone playing your copyrighted material in a private space for the
sake of entertainment r completely absurd..

when i want to sell my own tracks i will on my own label someday, that will
be my business and will put all my effort towards that. And the more people
that enjoy playing it, the better, and i dont want to get payed for that
(its free advertisement)..they paid enough just to go to a record store and
obtain it in the first place, dont you think? but if i heard someone else
was bootlegging it on a grandscale to make $$, id have them shot.

i was trying to look at the club owner/dj perspective of bmi/ascap
copyright claims...why the hell would u want to pay to play on the decks?
if i was a dj i would stop buying anything protected under bmi/ascap
policies. whether these policies make difference depends on the question:

What constitutes a public performance??
i could see maybe the Arts Festival or parades through the city..sure..but
hey ive never heard of a marching band playing an arrangement of silver
bells (which must copyrighted to someone) during the celebrate the season
parade that had to pay roalties. this is becuz theyre doing it for
enjoyment, not to make money.

and on the same note, clubs dont make money with their music ..they make it
with their alcohol and theyre cover charge...they dont sell copies of
"private performances" to the public (thus making in a concievably public
performance), and they dont associate copyrighted material in any
advertisement for thier club unless they pay. as far as i see it, they
arent doing anything illegal. they arent selling anyones music, theyre
selling the vibe..and u cant copyright that :P

Hey - I'm an interested party!  What's the scoop on this?  Is the idea to
have it at 168 again?  Perhaps Laga?  Personally I have a preference for
laga (or maybe a new, unique space?). 

	Considering both the space, and the location, you could have a
really big draw.  I know the goth night on wednesdays is surviving drawing
between 100-200 (usually on the low end), and i think a jungle night using
pgh's many avenues of promotion (the net, flyers, pirate & skool radio,
kids on the street) could make or beat a draw like that.  One thing I'd
suggest would be keeping it all-ages, or at the very least 18+, because
the truth is, lots of junglist are not 21+.  

Just thought I'd give some input (I have more thoughts, but I'd like to
hear what's going down first) since I was considering approaching
laga/organizing such a night, but i'd just as well contribute to the
efforts of other folks as do it myself.

they're the one who's doing the MC/B-Boy Battle. to make sure dial

hey i finally got a chance to review those records, it's harder than
it seems if you haven't done it before. i'm sending this to pb-cle too
in case anybody there might want to read this. i counted the beats the
best that i could & the BPM should be within 5, if you're pickier than
that, i don't know what to tell you. ;] ok here goes


Fate: "Step On"--Splash Recordings
----------------------------------
hardstep jungle. a good solid record, but like most hardstep, not too 
dynamic. they make you do all the work of making it sound interesting!
Magistrate Mix: 155 BPM. Has a sample of some guy saying "hold it now"
throughout the track. there's a big buildup in the middle, then the
bass gets funkier: 7/10 A-Sides Mix: 160 BPM. Similar except for the
addition of some bleepy sounds at various points, another buildup, + a
lot of drum rolls, plus the bass is even funkier: 7.5/10

R-Tyme--Transmat Classics
-------------------------
a re-release apparenty, i had thought it sounded familiar. all the
tracks seem to have sort of a clubbier + more european sound than what
i think one usually hears from transmat, but they're still good
tracks; kind of trancey electro with a bit of a house groove. 
Illusion: 125 BPM, Mayday Mix + Juan Mix. both have synth strings & a
funky bassline moving in + out, although the 2nd does more with the
strings + has a section in it with just drums: 8.5/10 R-Theme: 130
BPM, Mayday Mix + D Wynn's Mix. the Mayday Mix has a bongo drum with a
tribal-sounding rhythm, Kraftwerk-type sounds, synth horn & strings,
and snare drum buildups. the Dwynn Mix has more drums that are pitched
up, but no bongo, adds a cowbell, + has a trancier beat: 8/10

1016 Sonics--Bush Music UK
--------------------------
i like this record a lot. it has 4 tracks of detroit sounding techno. 
Goin Home: 130 BPM. starts out with a 4/4 beat + loopy ambient sounds
& cymbals, then that cuts out as laser gun sounds start, then it's all
brought back in with a breakbeat for more of an electro feel: 9/10
Magic: 130 BPM. this one starts out with a hard drum kick + some weird
reversed drumbeats, then all kinds of crazy robot sounds come in & out
& get progressively harder: 9.5/10 on the other side are 2 even harder
tracks, Do This and Do That, both 145 BPM. each has different various 
machine-type noises, although in Do That, the drum kick cuts out
sometimes for a beat, to make it funky, plus a repeating robot voice
has been added: 9.5/10 for both.

return of superfly was the first party i've been to in the columbus
area and i hve to say that i had i great time. all the kids out there
are sweet. i new it was going to be a little different when the first 
two djs in the first and second rooms were both spinning techno. that 
is something that unfortunately would never happen in the pittsburgh 
area. that is not a dis but more of a comment and i don't kid myself
about kids from pittsburgh even being remotely into techno. i myself 
found it very refreshing. much credit goes to walt at collective 
intelligence for an awl around bumpin party. he gave a couple pittsburgh
djs that he'd never actually scene before the chance to come over and
spin and i think that awl were pleasantly surprised. (sorry, they're
my friends but i think i'm being fair) the instigator tore up an early
evening set of techno in the second room thoroughly and bassclown put 
together a perfect set of housey toons in the main room. as for the 
others...dave hollands got screwed by some sound monkeys who had no
idea what they were doing by shutting down the main system for about
ten minutes during his set. i dunno the problem but the kids still dancing
to the monitor alone had it still goi. shake was churned out mad choons
as well. the venue for this event was a big bonus. i understand that many 
other parties have been there before but that this was the first time
that there was access to the back/2nd room. the layout of the space was
perfect. plenty of rooms of musik, places to sit and converse, and a
huge outdoor courtyard. the saddest part is that this space has now been
lost because of irresponsible fucks with markers who decided that a 
wonderful venue like this needed to be senselessly scribbled upon. this
is bullshit and i have alot more creative ideas of what they can do with
their fucking markers rather that screw the rest of the scene out of
a consistantly safe and perfect space. there is no room for tagging in
the scene, unless of course it is warranted. (ie: atlantis and such)
there are other means of getting one's "art" noticed like flyers.
there are plenty of promoters that would appreciate the help and more
people would notice and appreciate it too. that's my 2 cents on that
matter.  i hate to end on a sour note but it is shit like this that hurts
everyone because it makes it a hell of alot harder for promoters like
walt who have a good thing going to defend a bunch of tagging fools who
ruin things.

just wondering if anyone saw groove on the jam.  
the rock steady crew were awesome.

anyways, i brought them to laga and they had fun on thursday night but
they thought friday night at laga sucked...hmmmm....

so, anyways, i was going to bring them to mystic but they don't like the
music..i guess they were only interested in hip-hop...


so is there anything going on this weekend close to the pitts?


amy

Hmmm. I thought it was Jam on the Groove, I could be wrong though. Yeah
they're good, they're the originals. I caught their performance after my
set at Maskarave 4 in NYC 2 years ago.

Well you may want to check out Laga this friday. D-Cypol will be home on
break and he is spinning. I will be doing a live PA and also MCing for
D-Cypol. Could be fun if you like happy hardcore or drum & bass.

First of, I and Collective Intelligence would like to thank all 900
of you who came out to support our one year anniversary!!!!  A great
time was had by all.
     Unfortunately, we got the call today that the space on saturday is
been confirmed, no one will be able to use it again.
     This makes me really sad.  First, I would like to note that Walt
and I work together on these events and also a crew from Denison as well
as columbus people.  In any party props, please note the people seen
behind the scenes as well as the forrunners.  There has to be more
people than one person to throw a party.  It's pretty stressful at
times.  I also thank all of our crew that hung around to clean!!!!! 
Thank you all for the help!!!!
     I am really glad we got the Instigator and Bassclown down.  I heard
Bassclown's tape and made I immediately called him to book him!!! He
spins just what I love!!!!
     About the tags, why????  Why would someone want to ruin a great
space?"?? I do not understand.  Are kids not consideate these days????
This breaks every heart in Collective Intelligence.  It feels like we
put in so much effort for nothing.  but on the other side there was over
800 of you who knew the meaning of respect.  Thanx.
     Some of us were going to give up when we saw the destruction.  but
in the end, we all agree no one person is going to beat us down!!!
     I want all of you to think of things.  Do you know how hard it is
to find a space??? We have had events that we did not have a space until
2 days before the event.  Talk about stress.  Also, some kids get upset
because their crew, friends etc... do not have the "perfect' time slot. 
Not everyone can play between 12-3.  We try our best!!!! It is hard as
hell to do a line up. We consider the musical style of the DJ's so it
flows and does not seem choppy.
     These parties can be really stressful, all promoters try there
best.  We are all still human.
     Also, 2 more things.  If there are Dj's out there who would like
play time inColumbus, please call our info line at 614.470.3839.

AND........If there are any ARTISTS< WRITERS< PHOTOGRAPHERS< out there
would like to help us with our magazine please contact me(MELISSA) at
mhenry@cougarnet.netexp.net.

ALSO< Our po box is COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
                    PO BOX 141261
                    COLUMBUS< OHIO 43214

Once again, thank you all for the support!!!!:)

Peace,
MElissa and all the Collective Intelligence crew!!!!

Hi,

I sent a similar message a few weeks ago, so apologies if you have seen
parts of this before..

Quick intro:

For those who don't already know me, I'm in the band Skylab2000. We're based 
in Los Angeles and we play west coast trancy-acid-funky-breaks stuff with
plenty of wobbly acidic 303. As far releases go, we've got a bunch of 
independant releases, (ZYX Germany, Brainiak UK, Fatal Data US) plus tracks on
Keoki's and Taylor's mix CD.

More importantly, we play 100% live and play at parties all over the country.
In the next few months, we're playing in Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, Boston 
and New York..

Two things:

First, our new *fast* web site is up. The URL is now very simple:

http://skylab2000.com

Check it out.

Second, I'll be at Winter Music and will have plenty of our tapes and promo 
kits to give away. We will now be performing a short set down there on Sunday 
night, around 1:30am, so I hope to meet lots of you.

SPUNDAE'S @ WINTER MUSIC. Sunday March 23rd.
DJs Kimball Collins, Terry Mullan, Dmitry (NY), Robbie Hardkiss, Jon Williams,
Gavin Hardkiss, Jerry Bonham. Live performances by Skylab2000 and Symbiosis. 
At Amnesia, 136 Collins Avenue in South Beach. FREE with WMC - $10 without.

So, if you are gonna be at Winter Music, please email me now, so I can add you
to the list of people to try and hook up with (or at least drop off a promo 
kit to). I'll send email later with my hotel info, but if we don't hook up by 
email, we'll be at the FountaineBlue pool as much as possible.. :)

peace

Out of Nowhere -

    Does anyone have a copy of that Tunnelvision Video that UDG made?  I
really got an urge to see it last night.  I ordered a copy at one
time...but mysteriously it never arrived.  If anyone can lend me a copy or
a dub, or just let me check it sometime I'd be real happy.

l8s,
 geoff

Yes, but how can you communicate or feel (anything but frustration)
through something that can hardly be read? Changing the language here and
there to fit our needs is fine, and I think that's done pretty much
everyehwere, especialy here on the 'net :) But that stuff with random caps
and wordsruntogetherlikethis is just obnoxious :)

	Lemmie see here..there are 'variations' called dialects within a
language...there are also language derivatives like creole....now there's
ebonics (and my invention....the language for the blue collar class called
bluebonics). 
	If I may quote Eben Ozen...'there are 178 apparent languages on
this planet and over 1000 dialects. It's amazing we communicate at all.'

these types of things, the cost for a couple hundred rather small ones
of black & white (maybe like 2-3 color), and how long the process
takes....

thanks

  Hello.  My name is DJ Ritualist out of Atlanta, Ga. and I am a new breed 
of performer to the scene.  I have also just started my own production crew 
Innocent Endeavors which was created to throw raves for charity.   I am a 
mutant DJ/PA.  I use two personal computers to write and generate tracks. 
 I can alter my music spontaneously however I want... or I can write track 
ahead of time and mix them.  My sets currently are about 2 hours long... 
starting out with 130 bpm trance and working their way up to hard trance, 
ravey trance, a secret mixstyle track, bomb drops, anti-rave media samples, 
and blowing out with hardcore before dropping into drum'n'bass.  I have 
something for everyone and can alter my set to suit the setting.  I can 
promise that you will never hear any of my tracks on someone else's tables 
unless they have a 12 inch compilations that I will be putting out soon on 
a label.

So here is the good part.  You get an out of state talent... with a 
completely new and inventive setup... for virtually no cost.  How you might 
ask?  Well I fly for free so you don't have to shell out 400-600 dollars in 
airfare.  So all you are left with in cost is hotel *that is if I even 
really need one* and my fee which is VERY MODEST.

Steel City is about to make it's return.  It will most probably be at 
Laga (not Lava Lounge), since the people at Lava Lounge think that Manny 
Theiner is a DJ now (sheesh!), and refuse anyone else besides 
Spike&Enrique.  Anyways ... look for Steel City Jungle to be starting up 
on Tuesday nights again, soon come!  

While I'm at it, I'll mention Sunday School at the Three River's Brewing 
Company in the Strip District (starting Sunday 3/16).  There will be 
jungle at various times throughout the night, as well as Electro, 
Illbient, and Dub.  Come have a good locally brewed (as in "on the 
premises") beer with us!

Spring is heating up already...

This saga seems to be getting strange.

I ran into Soji-fu and Heidi in the Sq Hill Giant Eagle yesterday.  They
seemed pretty happy, she was pratically glowing.  They had heard about
this discussion on the net with a reaction mixed between irritation and
amusement.  She most emphatically denied that Soji had ever knocked her
to the ground or threatened to kill her.

Then again, I've heard nearly the same from women about situations of
abuse I've witnessed personally.  Words may mold ideas but they can't
truly change the past.

If you are interested in any other particular flyers, I also maintain

Sounds like a storyline for a soap opera like "As The World Burns" or
"Raves of Our Lives".

>what happened to the 100% confirmed virgin warehouse space?

I've been out sick for a while, so I don't know if anyone responded yet.

According to the promoters, Twin Productions, after the 20/20 aired its
highly negative views on raves, the owner of the warehouse simply
stopped returning their phone calls.

I don't know if they had a contract or not.  It really doesn't matter
wrt to actually throwing the event.  W/o a space the event won't
happen.

The Irish Center has been a very safe place to hold events going back
several years.  I especially liked that they set up the space
differently.

I was completely sober but with the flu tossing in rising fever to
make me a bit light headed.  I had a fantastic time.  It was a phat
party.  Quite simply one of the best in recent months.

In general, the only sour note to me were that so many people decided to
sneak the back.  The promoters worked hard and long to bring in some real
quality music and charged a fair price for it.  One of the people who came
in the back was another Pgh promoter.  Had he gone to the door, I rather
suspect he would have been let in out of professional curtesy.  Even if
that were not the case, given the way he throws money around, he certainly
has the cash to pay the ticket price.

Peace,

Just a reminder that I'll be performing a 1 hour live set at Laga this
friday featuring some of the new tracks on the forthcoming album "When
Worlds Collide".

Also D-Cypol will be back in town on break and spinning some of the newest
happy hardcore out. If you were around this summer then you know what to
expect: happy hardcore insanity like only D-Cypol and me on the m-i-c can
bring. Last time we did this at Laga everyone had a blast. Even the
bartenders were dancing and jumping around. We intend to do the same this
time around.

If you see me come up and say hi.

Subject:  Renegades--Floods and Prices

First off,  The flooding in Louisville will NOT interfere with the party.  The
water is far from the space or highways leading into Louisville.




Pricing:   This has been the subject of much debate in the
Evolution/Maxximum house for over a month.  As you know we are committed
to providing the highest value for your cost.  After weighing all the
factors, we came to the following conclusion:  To charge anything less
than $25 would be suicidal.  Before you freak out at the cost read onward.

For your $25 you will get:

	Renegades with all the goodies and DJS that have already been posted.

	A Free afterHours (something becoming distressingly rare these
	days).

	And as a show of appreciation and thanks, a free party (with a
	ticket stub from Renegades which you will get as you enter) in April
	featuring Kenny Ken (one of the top 5 jungle djs in the world) 
	plus some house djs tba in a smaller more intimate environment.


We realize that this is an expensive event, however, this is the minimum
price that affords a realistic chance of breaking even, and it will be
more than worth it in value delivered.  

Rest assured that this pricing structure will not be the norm for us.   
Our next big party is going to be $12 adv/$15 at the door.  

Thanks and we forward to seeing you this weekend.

ps.  any net raver making a reservation by 10 am sat. by emailing
maxximum@msn.com will be able to reserve a ticket for $22.

Stephanie,

Sorry, I don't know anything about jobs.  What really caught my eye was
the Spanish & Portuguese comment.  Were you raised speaking one or both ?
Or did you pick them up elsewhere ?

I spent a year in Brazil learning Portuguese.  Later, I studied Spanish
and have spent some months in Mexico visiting relatives.  I'm quite out
of practice in both languages but I pick up an El Pais once in a while
to check out the differing viewpoints on things.  I used to follow the
Brazilian and Mexican news groups when I had access to them.

Also regarding the summer.  I have a few rooms that I sometimes rent out.
I haven't decided whether to rent any out this summer or not.  I've tried
the random ravers and it really hasn't worked out well.  My basic stipulation
has become a secure income by the renter.  Its not the cash as much as
the stability inherent in keeping a job.  I like company but I can't afford
to let my house become party central again.  Though an occasional after party
is nice.  After, Mystic we had some forty people over with a few DJ spinning.
It tapered off to about 20 and went on till 10:30 pm.  It was really chill
and made quite a nice following to a really phat party.

Take care,

Philip

you can't tell what i look like?!?! hahaha suckers! ;] now you know 
why there is no such thing as an ascii police composite... i'm not
making sense anymore, i know. it's because i've been awake way too
long. who needs drugs now?!?! =D

while i'm in a bandwidth-wasting mood, i think i'll share with you a
couple of r.o.t.c. anecdotes. before the r.o.t.c. class starts, there 
is usually a video of something like bombs blowing up iraq + nazi 
planes getting shot down, military sorts of things, but yesterday 
there was 1 of those trippy eye candy videos playing. it's like into
the mind's eye or something. too bad the music on it was this
nauseating new age music, the mind's eye company can't even get any
ambient or what. 

2nd anecdote: we had a p.t. (physical training) day in class + since 
we need to keep stuff from getting monotonous, it was made aerobics 
day (not my idea!). so the aerobics instructor was making us do these 
complicated things that were like a line dancing nightmare. and every 
new move started on the wrong beat. i can't remember ever feeling so 
much like i can't dance. ;] then i started thinking, what excuse-for-
a-dj makes mixtapes of aerobics music? the music was like remixes of
_melissa etheridge_ (i'm not kidding) plus the standard 2 unlimited
pop music. then there was 1 track that was like a happy hardcore
record at -8, on it that was actually good, which confused me even
more.

> sorry for the lack of spice but i'm as sick as a dog :(

sorry josh :] hope you feel better! have some spice: basil, paprika,
nutmeg, tarragon...see all ya kidzz friday...

from the movie "The Hustler"...



Bert: We're gonna make a lotta money from now on.

Eddie: Fifty percent.

Bert: Nah, it doesn't have to be 50. It could be 30, 25.

Eddie: We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?

Bert: Ahh... 

Eddie: Oh, we really gave it to her good...

Bert: And if it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happen someplace
else. If it didn't happen now, it happen six months from now. That's
the kind of dame she was.

Eddie: But we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? 'Course, maybe that doesn't
stick in your throat, 'cause ya spit it out just the way you spit out
everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her
in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you, because who
did you ever care about? Just win. "Win," ya said, "win that's the 
important thing." You don't know what winning is, Bert. You're a loser!
'Cause you're dead inside. And ya can't live unless you make everything
else dead around ya! Too high, Bert-the price is too high. If I take it,
she never lived, she never died. We both know that's not true, Bert, 
don't we, huh? She lived, she died. Boy, you better-you tell your boys
they better kill me, Bert. They better go all the way with me. 'Cause
if they just bust me up, I'll put all those pieces back together again
and so help me, so help me, God. Bert, I'm gonna come back here and I'm
gonna kill you. [Bert's thugs move toward Eddie]

Bert: [Gesturing them away] No, no...All right. Only, don't ever walk
into a big-time pool hall again.

Eddie: [Turning to Minnesota Fats, who's been still the whole time] 
Fat Man, you shoot a great game of pool.

Minnesota Fats: So do you, Fast Eddie.

ele_mental :: project 1997
columbus ohio
 			 	 
	  	  		            [infrastructure]

							         -e1.0-
main entry: _infrastructure_
pronunciation: 'in-fr&-"str&k-ch&r, -(")fr
function: noun
date: 1927
1 : the underlying foundation or basic framework (as of a system or 
    organization)
2 : the permanent installations required for military purposes
3 : the system of public works of a country, state, or region; also : the 
    resources (as personnel, buildings, or equipment) required for an 
    activity 

__

in 1996 we presented a variety of events and ideas to you which were 
undertaken as THE LIBERATION OF SOUND, bringing ele_ments from every 
musical territory together and presenting them within the wider context 
of electronic and experimental musical history.   

now in 1997 we turn our attention towards the consolidation of our own 
INFRASTRUCTURE, through a wide variety of events (of all sizes) presented 
by ele_mental or in collaboration with others, musical releases by the 
21/22 CORPORATION, the ele_mental internet website, the table of 
ele_ments voiceline, pamphlets, flyers, and other underground modes and 
codes of communication.  with this wide array of strategies at our 
disposal, we hope to bring about new conceptions of the electronic music 
experience, emphasizing the connections between the structural ele_ments 
that underly music, dance, art, technology, history, language, social 
awareness, and community.  

we begin to build this INFRASTRUCTURE with a decoded message from 
detroit's UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE:

"we urge you to join the Resistance and help us to combat the mediocre 
audio and visual programming that is being fed to the inhabitants of 
earth, this programming is stagnating the minds of the people; building a 
wall between races and preventing world peace.  it is this wall we are 
going to smash.  by using the untapped energy potential of sound we are 
going to destroy this wall much the same as certain frequencies shatter 
glass.  techno is music based in experimentation; it is sacred to no one 
race; it has no definite sound.  it is music for the future of the Human 
Race.  without this music there will be no peace, no love, no vision.  by 
simply communicating through sound, Techno has brought people of all 
different nationalities together under one roof to enjoy themselves. 
isn't it obvious that music and dance are the keys to the universe?  so 
called primitive animals and tribal humans have known this for thousands 
of years!  we urge all brothers and sisters of the underground to create 
and transmit their tones and frequencies no matter how so called 
primitive their equipment may be. transmit these tones and wreck havoc on 
the programmers!  long live the Underground....."--the unknown writer, 
       						               detroit, MI

::: apologies for any duplicate messages :::

reverb.
                   http://hyperreal.com/zines/reverb/
issue nine.

renewal.

after months of stagnation, the concept known as reverb is back, this
time in the form of a full-fledged webzine.

whereas before our coverage spread from techno to hip-hop, ambient, acid
jazz and other genres, we're much more focused on the proliferation of
the detroit "meme" (forward thinking) as well as historical perspective
(reverse edits).

plunging deep into more multimedia possibilities, issue nine contains 
live footage of DBX and Rob Hood performing live, Claude Young and Carl
Craig's dj prowess The Cement Space (detroit's first "techno gallery")
and nine reviews (which will change in weekly increments of three).

our aim is to present techno in ways you're not used to experiencing it,
whether it be a quicktime clip of a live event or an audio file of that
elusive white label.

recalibrate to http://hyperreal.com/zines/reverb/ and enjoy.

sincerely,

dan sicko | matt macqueen

Sounds great..wish a could go, but I have "important school things" to do.
:(  Hopefully the flood-situation isn't effecting the party.
I do know at least one car-ful of pgh kids is driving down, including
O-John/Product19, Drew and some others, so pgh will def. be representing.
:)  I'll be at Laga as the 1-man whistle kru if need be...:P

Whats up Folx!!!?  Sorry about sending to all of you.  3;O)
I have been collecting rave flyers for a while now, and I am looking to
expand my collection.  I was wondering if any of you could help me out by
sending some flyers from your scene, and I will do the same for you if any
are interested. E mail me directly at (Digitalien@aol.com), because I am not
on your mailing list.  I feel that this would also make me aware what is
going on around the global scene. Like one guy said " Rave locally, Think
Globally".

If you don't mind feeling like someone has just made a few unauthorised 
modifications to your favourite brain, may I also reccomend "Tetsuo The 
Iron Man?"  Picked it up last week, and I think I blew most of my cerebal 
cortex...  And what is with the "Orb and Satan" rumours, anyway?  I've 
not heard anything backmasked in their stuff (checked for myself, no dice).

i can back this up because we, Network 10 Productions, booked Ron D. Core
for Elysium in milwaukee last summer and what-do-you-know????  NO
RON......the SCAM ARTIST, ooops i mean DJ, bookz himself months in advanece
with this long contract.....you follow all the legalities of the contract,
send him your deposit on time or early....even call him a couple weekz
before just to amek sure shit is straight.....go to the airport the day of
the party and guess what???? NO RON D. CORE....i guess he has been doing
this for a couple yearz now....and yes he doesn't ever bother returning the
deposit, shit why should he when he takes it he has no intentions of
spinning there......and this muthafucka  is supposed to be a HARDCORE dj
more like a hardcore dj who went LIMP......;P
sorry if this posting seemed shit-talking and ruthless but it is the truth
and has been confirmed thorough experience, not just mine, but numerous
other promoters throughout the country as proven by the above posting that
i am actually replying to and also by his peers in southern
california......i am sick seeing promoters get bad-mouthed because one of
the DJ's who was supposed to be headlining didnt show up in fact had no
intention of ever showing up....so i am going to go ahead and post this to
different rave mailing lists just as kind of a warning to promoters to be
careful....just to make sure no one thinks i am doing something behind
someones back wher they cannot defend theirselves i have also forwarded a
copy of this to Ron himself

        I made the 4 hour trek from Kent to Muncie Indiana this past
Saturday. The location was supposed to be behind a Pizza Hut, we found three
Pizza Huts before we found the right one! We pull behind to the spot to see
them loading the speakers onto a truck!!!!!!!  I guess someone broke a door
or something? I guess this was like the tenth location they had for this
party though. Anyhow there wasn't an alternate location. Needless to say I
was pretty pissed off. But we met some kewl cats from Indy that took us to a
pretty phat house party. UFO and two other dudes (I don't know who they
were) put on a extra phat ass jungle tag team set! And i'm not the biggest
fan of jungle, but I really dug there set. It sucked that there wasn't a
party but it wasn't to bad of time. Can't wait till this weekend at
Intimate.........

Please excuse the downline...and I hope I don't accidentally get sub'd to 
all these groups, but I think my question is a good one for all to ponder.

Good points. My question is this: Is there or shouldn't there be a list 
somewhere of DJ/Promoters who have certain quirks about doing business 
with them? Such as: Dj's who: just don't show; are pricks to everyone or 
even just the promoters or other DJs; over charge for little show; or 
commit other acts that others should be wary of. Promoters who: Don't 
care about the ravers/partiers safety; lie; etc...

I'm a promoter and DJ, but since I'm not IN the scene as my life, I don't 
know about all the shit that does go down. I hear tid bits here & there 
about wack DJs and punk Promoters, many of whom seem much worse than cops 
who shut down shows for no reason, but what's the best way for a promoter, 
looking to hire big name and little name DJs or PAs, to know who's worth 
dealing with. I hear and see all this shit about Keoki being a prick and 
spinning all fucked up, yet people hire him all the time, only to complain  
AFTER.
Any help?
peace out,

Plus, he is notorious for dressing up like an overweight clown :) Gotta
hate that in a 'hardcore' DJ <g>

My friend in Arizone interviewed him though, and said he was a pretty nice
guy, but if any of this is true, I'll gladly NOT support a Dr.Freecloud's
party if I'm ever in Cali. Of course, Simply Jeff ALWAYS seems to deliver,
but I don't like Simply Jeff's music (hes a good DJ though, don't get me
wrong)..

Yah, I've got a good idea.
FUCK big name acts who overcharge, and stick to talented little guys who 
actually depend on the money they get from occassional gigs to get by.
So, for instance, book me.  Heheh
Seriously though, as a promoter AND a DJ, I think I've got a pretty 
balanced perspective.  I'm sick of seeing party after party that's 20 or 
25 bucks, has a few big names, and very often not all the big names will 
even show.  FUCK THAT.  I say promoters should support the little guys 
who actually give a damn about the scene, who spin their hearts out, who 
are in love with the music... fuck k-hole-eoki, fuck robert no-show 
armani, ron d. softcore, fuck 'em ALL.

-Pez, Active Ingredients Productions, Activated Magazine, Baltimore

P.S. attn: promoters -- for a copy of "quickie", my new tape, 60 mins of 
phatty techno (detroit to harder stuff to trancier stuff) email me your 
snail addy and I'll get you a copy.  Everybody else, send four dollars to:

Nick Gold
Gocuher College
1021 Dulaney Valley Rd.
Baltimore, MD 21204

It's mixed well, has phat tunes by the likes of T1000, adam beyer, 
morgan, landstrumm, schmidt, lenk, blah blah blah GET IT PLEASE heheh

P.P.S. and if my constant self-promotion is bugging any of you (on 
ne-raves specifically) then BITE ME, if you were as poor as me then you'd 
be trying to get any gig you could too :P heheh rage on...

i apologize for going to all the lists with this, but i feel it's
extremely important for me to say this:

suggestion of a list or resource to badmouth djs is the worst thing i have
ever heard in my life!  you are talking about a blacklist!  history has
shown us time & time again that this sort of thing DOES NOT WORK and is
very damaging to our scene as a whole... imagine if someone posing as a
promoter had some beef with an innocent dj on another coast (gave his gf
the wrong look or somethint); he posted something to this blacklist just
for revenge and the dj couldn't get bookings in other parts of the
country.  that's the definite bad side of things... let people make their
own reputations & dig their own graves.  if a dj is consistently not
showing up, believe me, word gets out.  scott henry (i think it was him,
or it was some other big name dj) himself was getting this kind of beef
and the guy was physically ill & couldn't show up to parties.  but someone
like dj core will eventually have the tables turned on him & he won't get
booked anywhere.  there are steps to take to prevent this from happening:
don't give the guy money in advance until he can prove he can show up.  if
he desperately wants to play out, he can borrow money from someone to buy
a damn plane ticket & collect his $$ when he gets to the gig & pay
whomever he borrowed the $$ from back in full after the gig.  until he
proves himself trustworthy, then you guys can start paying him in advance.
but telling someone not to book him fucks up this scene even more, and a
blacklist is not the answer.  communication & compromise is.

peace, robin

I would agree with this.  Ron is a nice guy and very helpful.  To bad mouth
a DJ like this weather it's true or not is disrespectful and unprofessional
as a dj not showing up at a party.  If a problem like this comes up between
a promoter and a dj, then that problem should be handled between the two.
Not all the mailing list around the country.  If you haven't got something
nice to say about someone, and if you still decide to say it, at least say
it to there face and only there face.

Ron and Jeff have my support 110%, and I hope that Ron addresses the
situation in his defense.

Peace, Love, DJ Donovan (Intellihance Records, ESP/Sun, Black Magic Records)

The problem with a list of DJs and promoters who "flake" is that it might
be way too easy to get somebody's name on that list unfairly.  

If somebody had an enemy, for some other reason (like maybe even just a
competing DJ or promoter), this enemy could get
someone "blacklisted" and effectively end their career.

Of course, this could be happening now in less open ways than the list.
But if you're going to accuse someone of bad or unethical behavior publicly,
you need to at least give the person a chance to defend him/her self.

That's why society has traditionally had courts and judges and trials
'n' shit :->

Maybe something as simple as the stuff that goes on on these mailing 
lists is the key.   You have a problem with somebody, describe, as
unemotionally as possible, the problem:

	"We paid DJ Cranky to spin at Everlasting Torment, and he
	never showed.  Does anyone here know him or know his story?"

...and then DJ Cranky could respond with:

	"My manager, Fagin Talent, must have taken the money and not
	told me about the gig.  I was sitting home watching the 
	Late Movie and I didn't know shit about this."

...and then Fagin Talent could respond with:

	MAILERDAEMON error: Address unknown.  Phone disconnected.
	Office closed and cleaned out.  Tickets to Acapulco bought
	and used.  CYA, suckers!

... or something.  Sheesh.  It sucks reinventing civilization.  Why
don't you just sue each others' asses?   It's the American Way for
dealing with shit like this.

I was surprised to hear that the Swing Kids Guy(I don't remember his name)

Hi, I spin good techno (hard & minimal to mellower techno-house) and I'd
like to send a 60 minute tape to any producers/promoters in the
pittsburgh or cleveland area. Please e-mail me with a list of some of
the events/parties you've done. I can't spend an infinite amount of
dough on blank 60-minute tapes, so please serious inquiries only.

I also have my own (more complete) 90 minute tapes for trade or sale to
those interested.

Please reply, you won't regret.

Thanks,
Paul

well, i guess you wanted to get my attention and you damn well =
succeeded. First off lets let everyone in the whole fucking internet =
world know whats true and not true. this promoter has the right to be =
angry with me because i didn't show up to his show, but i didn't book =
myself far in advance on purpose just to keep the deposit and not show =
up, i had good intentions on showing up but i was having problems with =
flying, thats right i'm afraid of flying so now everyone knows it's no =
longer a secret. For about a year and a half i was having problems with =
my fear of flying but i'm starting to do gigs throughout the U.S. again, =
I still don't like flying but i'm learning to cope and deal with it. I =
will be showing up to all my future out of town gigs , so for those who =
have any doubt do not worry. Now for the angry one who is venting out to =
the whole country i hope your satisfied , I know i would't choose this =
route to gripe and tell everyone how frustrated i am. I guess what i did =
really got to you especially being over a year ago and today it's still =
on your mind. Please give me a call and we'll resolve this matter and =
return your deposit and what ever else it takes to make you happy. Just =
to let everyone know that overall i have a good track record on showing =
up to most of my gigs with the exception of 4 parties in the last two =
years. To me thats pretty good considering that I was booked every =
friday and saturday night. Still, thats no excuse, but the comparison is =
pretty minor. As for the promoter and the kids who were waiting for me =
to show up last year, again I am sorry. I just wanted to say that alot =
of people in this industry and more feel the way I do towards flying, so =
don't go off and slander me any more on the net, you made your point and =
chopped me down in front of everyone . Basically what you are telling =
everyone is 75% true and you were one of the 4 promoters that i flaked =
out on, but my only gripe was that you tell everyone about my personal =
life problems, thats all.				        RON D CORE=20

++++++++++++++++++++++ caution: long post! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++

did anybody hear about this party in akron sat? i don't think it had a
name, the flyer was little + green + said "all welcome! come and
groove!" and "420 akron". there was only 1 dj on it: scott e, who i've
never heard of, the promoters were stealth productions + the akron
kids who i've also never heard of. i had thought about going since it
was only $5 but i didn't have a ride. 

so i ended up at the phi delta theta keg party with my roommate + her
boyfriend. a friend of mine was DJing there but he said there wasn't
enough room for his turntables, so he brought cd players instead. he
was playing some cheesy pop/club music some of the time (since he's a
club DJ) but also old ass hip-hop :] + old michael jackson stuff :]
and...jungle (!?). a frat party is about the last place i'd expect to
hear jungle but people seemed to like it + they kept dancing.

i found the guy who had booked my friend & told him i'd make him a
mixtape (of hip-hop & maybe something like booty house or whatever,
with lotsa crazy tricks :] ) since i wanted to get booked for their 
next party + i know there's enough room to put the turntables on 
this bar in the basement. i'm not so sure if we need to start the 
should-dj-_______-spin-at-the-frat-party thread :o again though. i 
will spin anywhere i can--see below. (plus i always pick up lots of
guys at these parties (oops, no i didn't really say that did i? ;D )
--although they're not raver boys. :[ they're all so impressed with
how i dance, but in "rave-terms" i dance pretty much like everyone
else. so girls if you don't care if a guy might be in a fraternity,
go dance at a frat party + they will probably worship the ground you
walk on!)

anyway i had an idea for something that might be helpful for other DJs
(well this has probably been done before): post on the list things
like lessons you have learned, suggestions, tips, techniques, ideas,
whatever, about DJing. it doesn't matter how good you are, what you
spin, etc. the more information we exchange, the more it helps all of
us. so these are the things i've learned:

* if you are just starting out like me, don't get discouraged if all
  the slots you get are at 10pm & 7am. it's hard to be patient + spin 
  when there are only 15 people in the place, but keep on practicing. 
  someday you'll get the coveted 1am timeslot!

* don't buy any record just because it is popular. buy what you really
  like, whether it's popular or not. otherwise when you play it, your
  soul won't be in it + the audience will notice the lack of vibe.

* be VERY VERY picky about what records you buy. it is far worse to
  have good skills but only an ok selection of records than to have ok
  skills + a good selection of records.

* when you practice, get really creative & try crazy things. don't be
  afraid to do weird stuff! make a tape + listen to it so you can pick
  out the good parts (get input from friends too) + practice them.

* some people have told me it helps them to have a drink or 2 before
  their set, so they can relax more. this doesn't help me though,
  since it just throws off my coordination + reflexes. i spin better
  when i'm nervous + in front of people since i get lots of energy &
  adrenalin. so, in practice, you might try a little alcohol or other 
  drug of choice (if you do any of them) & see what it does. 
  definitely make a tape + listen to it sober so you can be objective.

* don't limit yourself to a certain style. the morre versatile you
  are, the more marketable you are.

* also if you're just starting out, spin anywhere & everywhere you get
  a chance to. getting paid counts too, but don't make that your
  primary concern; exposure should be.

* learn to read + work the crowd! :] (i'm still learning this since at
  when it's really early or late, there isn't much of a crowd to work)
  remember to make eye contact with people if it's not too dark &
  smile a lot! charisma is always an asset.

* always have a sense of humor & use it. don't take everything too
  seriously! =] =] =]

Hey I got to hand it to Ron D Core...hes got a point and 4 out of  over
100 events is a pretty good record (assuming its accurate)...Other big
names like Terry Mullan (ahem ahem) are much more infamous for not showing
up at gigs for stupid reasons, and i think Ron's fear of flying is
something we should all take into account. I share the same fear and I
must tell you sometimes you wish airplanes were never invented as you walk
down the aisle to find your coffin---errr, seat. :)

I have a tape of Ron's and I think hes a good DJ. And from his post he
seems like a nice down-to-earth guy with a lot more professionalism than
many other DJs out there who you only wish you could book. If you were to
ask me on the street if I would want to book him, even after all this
surfacing, I would say go for it :)

NO SHIT!

seems that after ron's reply and his offer to resolve passed wrongs,
that this thread is dead and you dopes can refrain from this national

Have you ever seen the Autodesk demo videos?  Lots of good animation to

Say...  i've been planning to put something like this on my homepage for

A good idea.  Sometimes, popular records have some great samples in them 
that you can toss into an otherwise minimalist track.  Or, just kick the 
speed all the way up and jam the pitch control as far as you can into the 
+ side, and listen to what happens.  Example:  M|A|R|R|S _Anitina_ turns 
into passable jungle!

Take the opportunity to give your tracks a test-spin if at all possible.  
Some places, like The Attic, don't let you do this, caveat purchaser.  :(

I've found that it's a good idea to have one or two friends listen to you 
while you're practicing.  Anything that causes a smile to break or a 
'Whoa..  that was cool!' should definitly cause you to stop everything 
and mess around with what you just did.

  * Don't be afraid to do things that make you worry that you could wreck 
	your 'table.  If you've got a record that really sucks because it's
	too slow, or has no lyrics, or or or, experiment!  Play with the
	33/45 speed buttons, no buttons on at all (press the other one lightly
	to switch them both off;  I did this to a soundtrack record and wound
	up with a sound not unlike the ship in _Alien_.  Cool effect for the
	background, thanks Anarchangel!), flick the pitch control up and down
	to alter the dynamics of the song, goose the record along a bit faster
	when the label is facing a particular direction, what have you.
	Just do the first thing that pops into your head.  Don't worry about
	mixing, just find some stuff that sounds cool.

If you're a caffeine junkie, like I am, I really don't reccomend this.  
It's too easy to use your newfound reaction time to get in over your head 
(1995's New Years party was a prime example:  spin, No-Doz..  spin, No-Doz..
spin, No-doz..  keep upping reaction time...  spin, No-D--- <thud>).  
Find another way to relax.  I find ten minutes of meditation, just 
clearing your mind, will cause yout body to stop releasing adrenalin 
until you really need it (when you need that Kibo track you keep stashed up 
your sleeve to make people FREAK!).

Amen.  Play with all styles of music.

Good call.

I'd think that smaller crowds would be easier when you're learning to 
gauge the Pulse.  Start small and work your way up.

> * always have a sense of humor & use it. don't take everything too
>   seriously! =] =] =]

Amen!!!  If you just blew a mix to kingdom come, don't mope about it, 
just laugh at yourself until you cry, then laugh some more.  Everyone has 
an off night.  Everyone has screwed up horrendously, it's nothing to be 
ashamed of.

 * Don't think you have to hunt for techno techno techno to mix with.  It's
	nice to have a stockpile of funky tracks to spin, but you don't 
	have to have all rave.  A friend of mine at WIUP (Sensei Adam) 
	doesn't have much techno at all.  He goes to the library now and again
	and pulls up the strangest stuff you've ever heard.  Spoken word,
	propaganda from the Cold War, tutorials, African drummers (if you
	kick up the speed, it's prototypical house), you name it.  Even if
	there is no music to speak of, you might find some cool samples that
	you can mix into another track you have.  Ever listen to Think Tank?
	Prime example.  Adam taught me that no record, regardless of the
	subject matter, can be ignored (I call him 'Sensei' for a reason).

 * You don't need the Killer Rig From Hell to practice with.  For a long 
	time, I had a Hack Shack mixer (still use it), a boom box, a
	turntable (gotta love Hack Shack), and a Walkman.  If you learn how
	to spin with very little, it forces you to practice getting things
	matched up, and when you do finally get your hands on a pair of
	Technics and a HUGE smegging mixer, you have less to relearn.

 * Records from your childhood are your friends.

 * It's really hard to mix with 45's unless you have a heavy dingbat.

 * Samples, samples, samples.  And if you don't have a sampler, a microphone
	and some movie schticks memorised can work (thank you, P&LI!).

Yo check it out I've seen it myself with my own eyes...

DJ trouble is really a girl!  and she's dating Superstar DJ Keoki.

We paid him $4000 to spin at our party and we thought he was gonna be a
guy.  But instead this chick shows up and sez "I'm DJ Trouble" and who
does she got with him but Keoki.  Anyways, she's carrying Keoki's
records, & they go over and get fucked up and Keoki starts spinning!!! 
We didn't pay $4000 to have some wacked out looser spin instead of DJ
Trouble who we originally was supposed to, 

so I say fuck that shit!
let everybody know!

This "slaggin" was added by a fourth production crew that is helping with
the show. To tell you the truth I have no idea what it even means!! Also it
was added after Myself (sleepyc of Psychoactive) and Chris of Spawntaneous
proof read the flyer, so we were just as suprised as everyone! So, sorry if
it bummed anyone out, but we can't change it now.
 Watch for the 4:20 die cuts, and posters commin soon! And remember: one
ill written sentence isn't going to spoil the phattness of the show!!
peace and respects to all those who are deserving,
Sleepy C

    Hey there,
    
    this is Babak Mir-Eschghi ( Mistophelous) and I am a DJ from
    Hannover/Germany.
    I recently moved to the US for studying this year and therefore, I had to
    stop my ClubDJing career in Germany. I worked together with "Paradizer", a
    promoter and producer of an acid-house Live Act and I used to be a local DJ
    hero around Hannover.
    My concern is to ask you if you are interested in making up serious DJ
    Bookings with me. I was talking to Paradizer support but their connections
    are not far enough to NY, therefore they told me to get directly in contact
    with promoters in this Area.
    The style is basically focusing on European Progressive House and it would be
    a pleasure to show what Hannover is about.
    In the US I got in contact with LSD Productions in Erie and he's looking
    forward to work with me. I heard that LSD is very new in the business ,
    that's why I'm asking you about Bookings too. 
    WHO are the major booking agencies around this area??  
    
    Please contact me for further Information and if you GET THIS MAIL. Thank
    you!
    
    If you doubt anything of this message, please contact Paradizer in
    Germany/Hannover : Tel.: 01140-5109-6606  or via e-mail: Paradizer@aol.com
    
    Bye the way...of course...you can book me in case as a German DJ on your
    flyer...
    
    Cincerely
    
                  Babak Mir-Eschghi

How about any even better moral? Everyone stop talking shit on both sides,
because its starting to get obnoxious, and unfriendly.
We have enough with the police, government and the rest of bitter america
against us that we don't need to be fighting each other. ;)

currently the spawntaneous line is out of service (no, spawntaneous
is not defunct as a few people have already asked me already after
calling the dead line & yes the party is still on...the line is simply
disconnected at this time because chris missed a bill)...i have 
given steve permission to use the PLRM line (216.556.1485) as an
info line for the ohio area until the spawntaneous line is back on
...until then u can tell yur ohio buds that the party is still going
on & they can call the PLRM info line if they need info about it and
to quit spreading rumors that the party is not going on because the
spawntaneous line is currently disconnected.

the comment had to do w/ phat-o's last event URANUS which didn't
exactly go off that well.

however i will vouch for sleepy c and chris of spawntaneous that 
they have no beef w/ patrick aka phat-o, because it was at Mars
last year where me & chris passed out most of the 420 flyers for
upstate new york last year. i have met patrick and he is very
courteous and professional. that is exactly why i listed him as
one of the better promotors on my 'true promotors' list from awhile
back, because he kept his word and gave me props at the door after
helping him promo for MARS in cleveland last year.

The Rhythm Room Grand Opening - Friday - Cleveland, Ohio
--------------------------------------------------------

welp i must admit i wuz looking kinda forward to this, especially
it was this space that i had originally suggested to sleepy c for
MUSIC, now i can tell u why...

DA SPACE 

i must admit i'm kinda biased toward this space becuz it's located
about a mile from where i live, but besides it's close proximity,
there are quite a few reasons i prefer this space...
 
+ it's got a boomin sound system, much louder than the brillo pad
+ it's got two floors: the top floor is bar atomosphere w/ pool tables
  (i even got to show sista spinsta a trick shot on one of 'em) and
  a room w/ couches for socializin -plus- the top floor is open to
  the bottom floor, so u can still hear the music from upstairs and
  watch the people dancing below
+ also located in the open center area is this huge widescreen, which
  they were showing japanimation, stevie luv's japanimation...they've
  also got multiple tv's located thru out the bar
+ nice tile floor for dancing below and couches on the side if yur 
  tired, there's even a second bar in the back...which wuz where i
  spent most of my time socializin' w/ the girley bartender back there,
  she even gave me a free pass for next time! which brings me to my
  next plus...
+ non-stuck up bartenders, for some reason the bartenders @ the brillo
  pad always ignored me when i wuz trying to get a beer, but the 
  bartenders here are actually nice to talk to

DA MUSIC

apologies to anybody that called my info-line & thought Feelgood was
going to be there, that was what Lady Ms. Lisa told me, so all blame
goes to her, however Rob Paine from Local 13 of Philly wuz there and
he did not dissapoint, altho by the time he went on i wuz pretty tired
(a whole week of little sleep due to midterms had gotten to me). also
in the house wuz my ole bud kevin kruellyn...i've been following kevin
since he wuz spinning from the space above rum runners and must admit
he is definitely improving...he's got some choice trax for some one 
who had to make the transition from fluff bar dj to underground bar dj
...if kat, sista spinsta spun, i missed, but i'm sure i'll be hearing
her plenty since she'll be the resident along w/ our very own jeff/stuff
who wuz for some unknown reason missing in action this first night...
btw jeff e me, i've got this killer idea of an all girl night out w/
sista spinsta, greta, keane, and mary from columbus

DA PEOPLE & THE VIBE

welp i must admit this 1st night out the vibe wuz kinda lackin...hardly
nobody wuz dancin (including myself)...but i think it had to do w/ the
fact it wuz grand opening night & it wuz mostly friends and friends of
friends, unfortunately all the old skoolahs are old foggies like me that
can barely move and would rather just sit on the couches and socialize
...which is what i did shootin the shit w/ sleepy c & mike filly      
reminiscing old skool daze...perhaps if kat will let me promo for her,
i'll bring more ravahs that can shake their booty and even book some 
decent out of town talent

ONE LAST IDEA

i think it would be really kewl if they did like what they did in baltimore
w/ FEVER and have it bi-monthly instead of weekly alternating it w/ DA NEW
STYLE in kent, so there would be less competition and more preparation w/
more talent

ONE VERY LAST IDEA 

i think it would be a good idea and i'm sure sleepy c can vouch for me to
have an official tagging wall (for instance a board between the men's and
women's bathroom would be ideal) for the taggers, so they can tag legally.

...but what the hell duz an ole foggy like me know anywaze...

	listen guys, this bad mouthing of dj's and promoters and whatnot is 
just not cool at all. Terry Mullan has played for me a few times and has not 
failed to show up once. I know about 30 gigs that he was supposed to play and 
did. However, I also know of a lot where promoters put him on the flier 
before they booked him. Whether this is because fliers had to be out early 
and communication wasn't there, or because the promoters were liars is 
debatable and changes with every event.  
	Terry is one of the most true to the scene djs i know and has been 
down since like the early eightites. he has done a ton for the scene all over 
the midwest and i won't even hear shit talked about him. if you got a problem 
take it up with him. all this crap is heresay. and anyone in the biz or 
really on the scene knows how much BS gets talked. don't beleieve the hype. 
get it from the horses mouth.

peaceout,
holly (nexus)

My message is at least in  part about Ron D. Core.  I want everbody to
know that I have a lot of respect for him.  I remember when he and Dj Dan
would trek to a tiny little whatever and spin for maybe 50-100 people at
No Doz back when it was tiny.  They both were there about every week that
i can remember. It was obviously a matter of professionalism.  That's why
I was pretty skeptical when the thread started up about how bad he was at
showing up at gigs.  I was disappointed myself when Dj Dan never showed up
at brass monkey.  This brings up a point.  Just because a Dj is put on a
flyer doesn't mean that they've actually been booked or even called.  It's
not that tough to put somebody's name on the flyer.  The likelihood of the
Dj finding out may be there, but how could they get the mass word out to
people.  There's just no way. Some people just don't take their
responsibilities seriously, or think there to important to be bothered
with showing up on time. Having seen Ron way back in the day, I can't see
how that could be true. So,it's up to people to get the right info before they go off on people.

Hi all, 

Sorry for the spam, but I'll make it short..

We (skylab2000) are off to Winter Music next week to play the Spundaes 
WMC party down there. Afthe that we'll be hanging around for a few day so if 
you wanna hook up send me an email..

I am bringing my girlfriend Christina with me, so you'll see us together a 
lot. During the day, I might be carrying a green bag (a bit smaller than 
record bag size) that will have a small Skylab2000 sticker on it, so if you 
see us, come introduce yourself. She has long straight brown hair and I look 
like I am from NY if that helps at all.. :)                                   
                                                                              
(There's pictures of me on our website if you're really a trainspotter)

If you'll be there and want to hook up, send me details on where you'll 
be staying..

See ya down there!

Send me stuff!!!

So far, I've gotten tracks from Ryu, PeteSysko (just dropped a dat off =
to me here at work--very cool), and Tea says that he's gonna add his and =
1.8.7's stuff.  Of course I've got a track or two.  So, that's five =
people and ten tracks.  Do we have enough for a tape?  You decide.  Send =
me stuff SOON!

For what it's worth, I may be moving out of the Pgh area come June, as =
my company's moving to the Bay Area, and I might decide to go with them. =
 I need to decide on this by May 1st, and I'll be spending the next =
month agonizing over this.  Therefore, an absolute deadline for =
submissions must be before June, so's I can get the tapes to Tea.  Of =
course, I want the tape to be well on it's way to completion way before =
June...

Tea, gimme an update on your situation.  Do you want to start working =
with the material we've got?  So far, I've gotten one cassette and one =
DAT.  My stuff will be on cassette.  Lemme know whatcha wanna do, and =
when ya wanna do it.

maybe the reason scott henry didn't show was because he wasn't booked.
granted he wouldn't have come anyway, due to an illness, but i talked to
the same booking agent and he wasn't booked anyhow. you may want to
question the reality of frankie bones missing his flight also.

the real question is did you book him and did he dis YOu. if so you have
a right to be mad. i have much respect for ron even if he did miss a gig
but he's being man enough to fix the problem and get the promoters cash
back. you were right about keoki. sorry if i sounded negitive it just
sounds like you guys were giving him a bad rap to all the promoters
around, its like if you had a ford and it broke down so you tell the
whole world not to buy ford's cause der chit(which they are)!

peace and much licks

I think Pez's reply to Ron D Core post aplyes to this one just as well.
Ken Lawrence, you're a fucking moron for paying a dj 4,000$!!!!  You can
get a dj who is as good if not better for around $150!  What a fucking
waste!  For 4000 an awsome rage can be thrown with awsome dj's and awsome
vibe!!!!!

after dissin on Real Productions info line, i will give some props
to a few info-lines that are purdy amusing...

212.229.7435 - guaranteed od - call this line! it will not dissapoint,
                               true east coast flavah! it's all good!
212.560.4373 - soulfusion - if u wanna hear what an east coast promotor
                            of the female persuasion sounds like
617.232.2030 - mission control - boston. nasa eat yur heart out! the
                                 info-line of the future.

u can pretty much tell what kind of promotor you're dealing with by 
their info-line...usually the more organized the info-line is, the
more organized the party will be...the more of an idiot a promotor
sounds like on the phone the higher chance the party will be bunk
...the more info they have on other partys, the more connections the
promotor has...no info on any other partys = no connections, this
promotor is not well established & is most prolly a newbie that's
only concerned with themselves...u get the gist...

I'm pretty sure that Disintegrator, or some other guy on Industrial
Strength, is on the nyc-raves mailing list. You could try there. You can
get on the list through hyperreal.

I think Keoki's "All Mixed Up" was a pretty incredible piece of music
myself... And I've seen him perform extremely well, and sometimes on the

To my knowledge Goodvibe is still open...I was just at Future Sound this
past weekend, I was disappointed, so I basically looking for a different
place to go...I usually deal alot with 611 Records in Philly and Satellite
in NYC, but since I'm out at school it makes it difficult to get back out
there.  I will call Goodvibe Records tomm, or soon (I promise) and will
post the results and directions, if I can get them.  If anyone beats me to
the result please carbon me on your post!!  Thanks..
Love always-
Nicole

Now THAT post is bound to generate more responses than my bogus ***WORK
OF FICTION*** post that upon reading my e-mail appears to have been
taken seriously by some members of the EarthRaves mailing list.

I don't think it matters if you have a penis while you're DJing.

Now back tyo your EarthRaves annoying thread of the day.

you said this regarding Terry Mullen's reputation for not showing up:

> all this crap is heresay. and anyone in the biz or 
>really on the scene knows how much BS gets talked. don't beleieve the hype. 
>get it from the horses mouth.

well, That may be true for your region, but I know of at least three or four
times within the last 6 months that he has no-showed here in Texas. --and
one of those times I spoke directly with the promoter in person, and she
said that he just didn't get on his plane... and another time the promoter
posted to the list that the same thing occurred with his party. those are
two out of at least three that clearly weren't heresay... I'm not denying
that when I heard similar stories for the other times he didn't show in
Texas it wasn't directly from a primary source.
If someone has a reputation, they have a reputation. Usually, these sort of
things come from some-if not all-truth.
I think it's legitimate and understandable for someone to at least question
a performer's consistency if one has heard negative things about him or her.
It's a fundamental way of sharing information (by mouth), and we can't just
ignore everything we hear and toss it all out as heresay. 
It comes down to using personal judgment to determine the accuracy and
credibility of the sources and make descisions accordingly. 
It is natural for us to recognise trends, make statements about these
trends, and change our behavior to best handle them. 

So while I respect your point of view, I do not agree that Terry Mullen's
no-show reputation is bogus. I know for a fact that he has been booked
multiple times in Texas and has yet to make an appearance. 

Regarding this whole issue:
Each of us is capable of discerning how much we can depend on what we hear
(or read), so don't badmouth people for voicing their negative experiences
with a DJ or promoter or piece of equipment. We all have brains and every
once in a while we manage to use them, so let's maximize the opportunity to
do so by "uninhibiting" information.

the end.

Well...Terry Mullan showed up at Cain When Britton & I opened it And he always 
showed up in Cleveland  andout east...go figure...
Just consider this....Texas promotors tend to be whack (dont get me started on 
the whole SwingKids/Planet x thread....)and I've been throwing parties forover 
5 years out east and other places and have been attending themallover the 
world for 9 years (been to UK/Europe 4 times) and I've never seen so many 
noshows like I have here(i.e. Texas) and after following up on all these hate 
posts lately and contacting over 20 major DJ's over the past 2 days(the 
accused and unaccused)They almost all said that they dread getting booked in 
Texas because almost every time they leave unpaid.  I am guilty of this same 
crime because of 1997(Escapade..),  and the whole country knew about this 
event and every DJ behind the scenes knows about what happened there; they 
knew a whack promotor fucked it up. No Other promotor has ever intetionally 
screwed up such a huge party with nationwide (and beyond) anticipation.That 
KILLED our scene, as far as out of state DJ's goes (we still have each 
other..right Noah?, Curly? and you all who made it great anyway....) According 
to one of my best and oldest friends on the Planet, who is a worldwide known 
DJ/Producer Terry and other DJ's-including him-either 

1)were never really booked and the promotor pulled the victim act...

2)Never got a plane ticket and      "	"	"	" <---  (means ditto)

3)Never got their deposit and        "	"	"	"

4)Didn't fulfill their part of th contract         "	"	"
	i.e. which even though the DJ got his deposit the promotor didn't call        
                                                         with the hotel 
reservation and room number at least 14 days ahead and  verify a non-smoking 
room--which I admit is petty-- but This is a business and a promotor signs a 
contract, he-by law- has to comply with every word or the DJ has every right 
and reason to take a saturday off and chill at home, because the promotor 
showed signs of being irresponsible and has an understandable reason to think 
the promotor is a slacker (or a scammer in texas). Terry and Ron are huge and 
they get a bad rap for not showing up, But WE NEVER ASKED THEM WHY...DID WE? 
We just talked shit..For people who are so skeptical and criticizing (that was 
a gentle term..) of the promotors in texas and most other places, you don't 
make a second thought when they say "so and so        
never showed up!" Why believe them and instantly bash the DJ name on The 
Information Superhighway for the whole world to see? Why would someone like 
Terry Mullan, who I personally know to be a man who loves what he does and 
loves to spin for crowds who flock to him, not show up and do what heloves for 

a thousand dollars? Think about that...he didnt get where he is by fucking the 
scene.I agree some Dj's are dicks-but please-get real.......consider the 
integrity of the promotors who say this stuff, get he both sides of the story 
and i bet a lot of promotors would get heir feelings hurt when they checked 
their email.
If the Dj doesn't draw the line, then their asses would be sore and bleeding 
from all the constant ass fucking they would be getting weekend, and their 
love for DJing would be overtaken by their hatred from being screwed all the 
time (why do you think redeye doesn't play much around here anymore? Because 
he's too nice...This is a business and these guys depend on it or they and 
their Families (yes some people live off of this career choice) will not have 
a roof over their head.

  Anyway...don't click 'send' until you know the whole story cuase then its 
too late.....					Thanks for listening

Subject: 	TXRAVES: Terry Mullen Mutation (was RE: DJ RON D. CORE-WARNING TO 
PROMOTERS was Re: no-show DJs) *gasp*

you said this regarding Terry Mullen's reputation for not showing up:

> all this crap is heresay. and anyone in the biz or 
>really on the scene knows how much BS gets talked. don't beleieve the hype. 
>get it from the horses mouth.

well, That may be true for your region, but I know of at least three or four
times within the last 6 months that he has no-showed here in Texas. --and
one of those times I spoke directly with the promoter in person, and she
said that he just didn't get on his plane... and another time the promoter
posted to the list that the same thing occurred with his party. those are
two out of at least three that clearly weren't heresay... I'm not denying
that when I heard similar stories for the other times he didn't show in
Texas it wasn't directly from a primary source.
If someone has a reputation, they have a reputation. Usually, these sort of
things come from some-if not all-truth.
I think it's legitimate and understandable for someone to at least question
a performer's consistency if one has heard negative things about him or her.
It's a fundamental way of sharing information (by mouth), and we can't just
ignore everything we hear and toss it all out as heresay. 
It comes down to using personal judgment to determine the accuracy and
credibility of the sources and make descisions accordingly. 
It is natural for us to recognise trends, make statements about these
trends, and change our behavior to best handle them. 

So while I respect your point of view, I do not agree that Terry Mullen's
no-show reputation is bogus. I know for a fact that he has been booked
multiple times in Texas and has yet to make an appearance. 

Regarding this whole issue:
Each of us is capable of discerning how much we can depend on what we hear
(or read), so don't badmouth people for voicing their negative experiences
with a DJ or promoter or piece of equipment. We all have brains and every
once in a while we manage to use them, so let's maximize the opportunity to
do so by "uninhibiting" information.

the end.

respectfully
summer

i agree with the comments on the grrl dj thang.. i'm a pretty new jungle
dj and while on the surface peeps are supportive, whenever i give out a
mixtape there is the comment "oh someone is throwing an all grrl dj
party". while that may be somewhat nice, i'm not interested in being a
novelty. i wanna play with the big boys, alongside other skilled boy
and grrl djs.
it's about talent, not gender.. i wish more promoters understood that.

I got responses from Erie, PA to Euclid, Ohio for my free demo tape. But
how come I haven't heard from any party-throwers in Pittsburgh? Is the
city dieing or is has it all been junglized??? :)

okay here's my selling line: "I'm good and cheap!!" like a Liberty

p.s. Is the downtown record store still open? I've checked GoodVibes in
Oakland and it looks dead as a doornail (unless they moved). Not that
they had much when they were around...

I just wanted to see if anyone responded to this because if there is still
a Tunnelvision video out there, I'd like to see it... order one or
whatever... someone write back and tell me what's up with this video.  :)
Thanks.  :)

No shit........ actually, he's been to texas five times.

The first time, it was for Rom Hypermedia's party in Austin.  That party
went over well.

The second time was at a club in Austin.  They put him on at 2 am on a
thursday. If you know how Austin clubs are, then you know by 1:45 the bars
clear out.  He played for like 50 people.

The third time was the next night in Dallas.  They put him on last and he
spun for like 40 or 50 people.

The fourth time was in Houston.  The cops were cruising the place busting
kids left and right.  The vibe was hurtin' pretty bad by the time he got
on.  I think all of 100 kids were left by the time he went on.

The fifth time, was what Adrian was talking about.

IMHO, i'd rather him Terry Mullan spin anywhere but Texas.  At least I have
people to dance with and reminise about his performance at a later time.

No offense texas rave scene, you know I love ya overall.

Well...Terry Mullan showed up at Cain When Britton & I opened it And he always 
showed up in Cleveland  andout east...go figure...
Just consider this....Texas promotors tend to be whack (dont get me started on 
the whole SwingKids/Planet x thread....)and I've been throwing parties forover 
5 years out east and other places and have been attending themallover the 
world for 9 years (been to UK/Europe 4 times) and I've never seen so many 
noshows like I have here(i.e. Texas) and after following up on all these hate 
posts lately and contacting over 20 major DJ's over the past 2 days(the 
accused and unaccused)They almost all said that they dread getting booked in 
Texas because almost every time they leave unpaid.  I am guilty of this same 
crime because of 1997(Escapade..),  and the whole country knew about this 
event and every DJ behind the scenes knows about what happened there; they 
knew a whack promotor fucked it up. No Other promotor has ever intetionally 
screwed up such a huge party with nationwide (and beyond) anticipation.That 
KILLED our scene, as far as out of state DJ's goes (we still have each 
other..right Noah?, Curly? and you all who made it great anyway....) According 
to one of my best and oldest friends on the Planet, who is a worldwide known 
DJ/Producer Terry and other DJ's-including him-either 

1)were never really booked and the promotor pulled the victim act...

2)Never got a plane ticket and      "	"	"	" <---  (means ditto)

3)Never got their deposit and        "	"	"	"

4)Didn't fulfill their part of th contract         "	"	"
	i.e. which even though the DJ got his deposit the promotor didn't call        
                                                         with the hotel 
reservation and room number at least 14 days ahead and  verify a non-smoking 
room--which I admit is petty-- but This is a business and a promotor signs a 
contract, he-by law- has to comply with every word or the DJ has every right 
and reason to take a saturday off and chill at home, because the promotor 
showed signs of being irresponsible and has an understandable reason to think 
the promotor is a slacker (or a scammer in texas). Terry and Ron are huge and 
they get a bad rap for not showing up, But WE NEVER ASKED THEM WHY...DID WE? 
We just talked shit..For people who are so skeptical and criticizing (that was 
a gentle term..) of the promotors in texas and most other places, you don't 
make a second thought when they say "so and so        
never showed up!" Why believe them and instantly bash the DJ name on The 
Information Superhighway for the whole world to see? Why would someone like 
Terry Mullan, who I personally know to be a man who loves what he does and 
loves to spin for crowds who flock to him, not show up and do what heloves for 

a thousand dollars? Think about that...he didnt get where he is by fucking the 
scene.I agree some Dj's are dicks-but please-get real.......consider the 
integrity of the promotors who say this stuff, get he both sides of the story 
and i bet a lot of promotors would get heir feelings hurt when they checked 
their email.
If the Dj doesn't draw the line, then their asses would be sore and bleeding 
from all the constant ass fucking they would be getting weekend, and their 
love for DJing would be overtaken by their hatred from being screwed all the 
time (why do you think redeye doesn't play much around here anymore? Because 
he's too nice...This is a business and these guys depend on it or they and 
their Families (yes some people live off of this career choice) will not have 
a roof over their head.

  Anyway...don't click 'send' until you know the whole story cuase then its 
too late.....					Thanks for listening

Subject: 	TXRAVES: Terry Mullen Mutation (was RE: DJ RON D. CORE-WARNING TO 
PROMOTERS was Re: no-show DJs) *gasp*

you said this regarding Terry Mullen's reputation for not showing up:

> all this crap is heresay. and anyone in the biz or 
>really on the scene knows how much BS gets talked. don't beleieve the hype. 
>get it from the horses mouth.

well, That may be true for your region, but I know of at least three or four
times within the last 6 months that he has no-showed here in Texas. --and
one of those times I spoke directly with the promoter in person, and she
said that he just didn't get on his plane... and another time the promoter
posted to the list that the same thing occurred with his party. those are
two out of at least three that clearly weren't heresay... I'm not denying
that when I heard similar stories for the other times he didn't show in
Texas it wasn't directly from a primary source.
If someone has a reputation, they have a reputation. Usually, these sort of
things come from some-if not all-truth.
I think it's legitimate and understandable for someone to at least question
a performer's consistency if one has heard negative things about him or her.
It's a fundamental way of sharing information (by mouth), and we can't just
ignore everything we hear and toss it all out as heresay. 
It comes down to using personal judgment to determine the accuracy and
credibility of the sources and make descisions accordingly. 
It is natural for us to recognise trends, make statements about these
trends, and change our behavior to best handle them. 

So while I respect your point of view, I do not agree that Terry Mullen's
no-show reputation is bogus. I know for a fact that he has been booked
multiple times in Texas and has yet to make an appearance. 

Regarding this whole issue:
Each of us is capable of discerning how much we can depend on what we hear
(or read), so don't badmouth people for voicing their negative experiences
with a DJ or promoter or piece of equipment. We all have brains and every
once in a while we manage to use them, so let's maximize the opportunity to
do so by "uninhibiting" information.

the end.

respectfully
summer

No doubt man, go west!  Check out the scene elsewhere and play them our
PB-CLE tape :-) I too will be leaving Pittsburgh this summer, hopefully by
the end of July.  So for this to happen on any kind of useful scale, I'll
need everything by the end of May at the latest.  So, uhm, does your
company need any Computer Networks people/ Sysadmins to go with them.  I
know of a great guy who is getting his Masters in Information Science this
April (hint hint).

Well, this weekend if very busy for me.  I'm spinning at Projekt 
Hausparty on Saturday (hope y'all are coming, call 661-mskw IT'S FREE!!!) 
and again on Sunday for the opening of Sunday School at Three River's 
Brewing Company.  AND, I have a mid-term on Monday.  Next week-end is 
also booked 'cause I'm spinning in Philly, so let's try to get our shit 
together for early April and I'll start working with whatever we've got 
at that point.  If anything, the four or five of us who are doing this 
will get to hear each other's tunes :-)

from the ONION, Vol. 31, Number 19, 12-18 March, 1997.

U.S TECHNO-INDUSTRIAL BASE ERODING DUE TO FOREIGN COMPETITION

	WASHINGTON, DC - With first-quarter Club Rotation Index figures
the lowest in seven years, and imports outselling domestic 12-inches more than 
two-to-one, economic observers throughout the U.S. are sounding the alarm
over the nations rapidly declining techno-industrial base.
	America faces a grave moment of crisis, said DJ Nathan Brackett, 
Secretary of Industrial and Hardcore, in a recent speech before Congress.  
Vinyl imports from both Europe and Japan are threatening our nations 
once-great techno-industrial power base.  Our Gross National Beats Per
Minute is at its lowest point since 1991.  The message is clear:  We must
fuck up the mix, or all is lost.
	In the late 80s/early 90s heyday, America seemed unstoppable.  Led
by such formidable powers as Nine Inch Nails and Ministry, the U.S. achieved 
near-total dominance of the global dance-mix marketplace.  Even in the 
traditionally insular Eurodisco field, the loud, banging, clamorous sound
of American made techno strongly influenced such foreign powers as Front 242
and KMFDM.
	Less than a decade later, however, the glory days of the American 
techno-industrial complex seem far away.  With over 20,000 former 
clubgoing elite out of work in the warehouse district of Chicago, and the
Detroit house scene over $7 billion in debt, bitterness over the nations
eroding techno-industrial base can be felt throughout its once-thriving
industrial centers.
	And with the rise of such overseas dope on wax as drum n bass,
ambient and jungle, the problem, experts say, is not going to go away any
time soon.
	In fact, many fear that foreign competition from such
heavy-hitting imports as Englands Prodigy and Chemical Brothers, Germanys
Atari Teenage Riot and Japans DJ Krush - whos rare vinyl imports fetch up
to $29.99 domesticically, even for a remix track - will overtake America's
floundering techno-industrial base by the year 2000.
	Many, including NYC illbients DJ Spooky, contend that fault lies
in American industrials inability to adapt to the changing realities of
modern times.
	We must retool Americas angry, metallic, hard-edged industrial mix
to better reflect the mellowtronic, groovadelic peace memes of the emergent
global cyber-age, he said.
	Californias DJ Shadow agreed.  We are being beaten at our own
game.  Trip-hop was invented here, but right now, the British are simply doing
it better, he said.  America has got to seriously remix its priorities.
	In the face of foreign dance-floor dominance, President Clinton is 
urging Congress to pump money into the revitalization of the nations 
techno-industrial infrastructure.
	Its not enough to say, We must rock the crazy beats, President 
Clinton said Monday in a secret live appearance at D.C.s famed underground
The 930 Club.  If American techno is to become the worlds leader once again,
we must drop much bass; we must rock mad, phat-ass, crazy beats; and we must
do it so quick-fast in a hurry; 24-7, 365. and i am out.
	Many conservatives in Congress, however, oppose to such change.
U.S. techno-industrial is hardcore, and it must stay hardcore, said Sen. Orrin
Hatch (R-UT).  Would Al Jourgensen wear a T-shirt depicting smiley aliens
telepathing Love to their baggy-pantsed children ?  Techno should be about
hate, not love.  Techno is about wearing black and screaming, not standing
in one place swaying peacefully.  I say, bring back the days of Skinny
Puppy.
	Techno ?  Industrial ?  I am not familiar with these strange
terms, said Rolling Stone magazines Jann Wenner, speaking from one of his boats.
I do understand, however, that something called electronica is the Next Big 
Thing.  It says so on the cover of our latest issue.

tonight's the night!  as if you didn't know, this party is going to be 
the bomb.  carlos, terry mullan, trevor lamont, and an extra-special 
amazing performance by mr morgan geist (you will all remember that name 
after this event!)...need i say more.  and it won't rip a new hole in 
your pocket, either...in true columbus fasion.

now here's the pertinent info, how to get here:

- from the N take I 71 S to I 70 W, get off at exit 94 which is the WILSON 
  RD exit, go LEFT.
- from the S take I 71 N to I 70 W, get off at exit 94 which is the WILSON 
  RD exit, go LEFT.
- from the E take I 70 W, pass downtown columbus, and get off at exit 94 
  which is the WILSON RD exit, go LEFT.
- from the W take I 70 E, pass 270 and immediately look for exit 94 which 
  is the WILSON RD exit, go RIGHT.

stay on wilson going south for about 1/2 mile and then just past a green 
HQ sign look for VALLEYVIEW.  take a LEFT on valleyview and the space 
will be about 1/2 mile down, on the RIGHT.

the space is the YMCA, suburban west branch, 2879 valleyview dr.

doors will open at 11 PM, and the event will go until 6 AM.  

admission will be $10 from 11 PM - 12 midnight ONLY, then $13 thereafter. 
regretfully, you will be charged $13 even if you are in line at 12
midnight (once you see the budget you'll know why: we need a LOT of people
to break even!). 

the lineup:

haiku              11 PM - 12 mid 
trevor lamont     12 mid - 1.15 AM
titonton            1.15 - 1.45
terry mullan        1.45 - 3.00
morgan geist live   3.00 - 3.30
carlos              3.30 - 4.45
perry ellis         4.45 - 6.00

free afterhours presented by atman, directions will be available at the 
event.

any problems consult the haiku line at 614.470.3574
or the table of ele_ments at 614.470.0929

if i knew how to write a haiku i would do so right now.

Hey kids sorry to spam the net like this, but right now we're workin on
putting out a new edition of Crossfade (formerly Swell, sorry about the
confusion az :)

For those that don't know, Crossfade is an underground mag based out of
Dallas, Tx.  Anyway, we're currently in the middle of a massive overhaul
in formatting and one of the things that is being adding is a page or
two of dj charts.  We're trying to get a varied selection of what's
being played around the country, so this is my call for all the dj's to
send a list of your top ten records.  Please be sure and include the
title artist and label.  We will try to put as many in the magazine as
possible.  Thanks

nathan
nation

btw for subscription info and all that send e-mail to
Crossfade5@aol.com, but please send the charts to my addy.  ;P

wow, that was a great fuckin party. all i can say is Morgan Geist
completely and totally transported me to another level. sometime told me
this was his first live pa (anyone confirm?), it really didn't sound like
it to me. i wish i could remember more about his set, but trust me go see
him if you have the chance, i can't remember a time my mind was just more
fucked with and blown apart than those 35 or so minutes. ok, so terry
mullen didn't spin; i was disappointed yeah, but titonton threw down a
wicked breakbeat/d&b set in his place that i totally dug, and for $10
bucks (and a 2 hour drive) i couldn't have been happier. trevor lamont
really got me moving at the right time, and carlos spun a tight tight set 
that had everybody moving as hard as they could. the gym/dancefloor got to
be sickening hot, i was drenched in sweat from head to toe, good thing
there was a water fountain out there. the vibe was THICK, people were
just going crazy and cheering, tons of smiles/hugs :) ok can someone tell
me why the party ended like 30-40 minutes early? i was expecting to go
until 6am...when i left my clothes pretty much froze directly to my skin,
it was COLD!! the roads were kinda shitty, snowy and icy, i hope everyone
made it home ok. once again huge thanks to ele_mental, haiku and spank for
throwing a phat phat party, i wish they could all be this good (and
cheap). :) i'll see everyone at nitrogen on the 28th!

alright folks, here's my views on the evening...


when i got there titonton was in the middle of his first of two sets...i
didn't even know or else i would have made it into the main room instead of
socializing.  heh...i missed the whole thing...

next up was trevor lamont.  it was at this time that i was really concerned
about the sound.  at the other party that was thrown at this location, it
was even worse since there were only a couple hundred kids there, but we are
talking about a large gymnasium that could hold 1000+.  we've got *4*
speakers to a side.  this setup is for a room about half the size of the one
that it was in.  unless i was *right* in front of the speakers it was just
plain mud.  i understand keeping the costs down and all of that so i wasn't
compplaining since i only paid $10...  it still was very nervewracking.  i
think it got a little better towards the later part of the night.  i liked
what little i could make out of his set though...

then titonton went on again in a full on dark ass drum n' bass set.  this
was one of my personal favorite sets of his that i've seen.  my favorite
part was when he just tore up those eq's for about two minutes straight.  it
is *very* seldom that i see a dj take full advantage of the eq's (sliders in
particular) and he fucking made that track into something completely
different than what was on that slab of vinyl.  a dj who would be my example
of an "eq master" would definitely be detroit's Billeebob...anyhow.....

next up was the reason i personally came.  Morgan Geist's first (and
hopefully not last) live pa.  already being into his material, i had some
sort of expectation.  the majority of the rest of the floor, however, had no
idea...

there was nonstop dancing, screaming and other delights from the ENTIRE
floor during morgan geist's  set.  it FUCKING SLAMMED.  anyone who thinks
otherwise should be stoned to death by the official dj Lars fan club. 

you know what, i'm not even going to bother writing anything else.  just
forget about everything i wrote before i mentioned morgan geist.  not to
take anything away from the other talent of the evening but this party was
ALL ABOUT MORGAN.

yes i am biased....sorry.

--jeff/stuff (that guy)

ps. at least you got a little more info out of me before i succombed to
"morgan syndrome" which is obviously what Ed Luna was under when he posted
earlier  ;)

No shit........ actually, he's been to texas five times.

The first time, it was for Rom Hypermedia's party in Austin.  That party
went over well.

The second time was at a club in Austin.  They put him on at 2 am on a
thursday. If you know how Austin clubs are, then you know by 1:45 the bars
clear out.  He played for like 50 people.

The third time was the next night in Dallas.  They put him on last and he
spun for like 40 or 50 people.

The fourth time was in Houston.  The cops were cruising the place busting
kids left and right.  The vibe was hurtin' pretty bad by the time he got
on.  I think all of 100 kids were left by the time he went on.

The fifth time, was what Adrian was talking about.

IMHO, i'd rather him Terry Mullan spin anywhere but Texas.  At least I have
people to dance with and reminise about his performance at a later time.

No offense texas rave scene, you know I love ya overall.

Precedence: bulk




a recent post stated that perhaps ne-raves was doing more harm than good
lately...that instead of being an asset to the scene, ne-raves was a
liability in terms of the presence and awareness of the authorities on this
list, the constant negativity and bickering between members of the list,
the ignorance and spreading of rumours running rampant....


what do you think? this is not anything more than a SUBJECT FOR INTELLIGENT
DISCUSSION...take a minute...think about it...mull it over...think
again....if you have anything pertinent and constructive to say, please do.

the scene isnt really underground anymore...what would we be losing if we
ended the calendar....nothing that record stores and infolines all up and
down the east coast cant tell us...and those little vibey underground
parties that rock so hard would more than likely be harmed more than helped
by advertising on this list if they are operating on a renegade
basis....'word of mouth' does not mean spreading information to over 300
ppl all over the country (and the world) including law enforcement
officials.

i feel that this summer's parties could rock hardcore. its either gonna be 
deeeeeeeep underground or totally concert style mega-events...both are
good, both are fun, its your call which you attend.  i think the direction 
were headed is gonna squeeze out the mid-sized promoters and parties...it's
a casuality of the direction the ppl in the 'scene' chose to follow.


lately, ive been having a blast at parties again. i have been totally into
the music...all sorts, even stuff i didnt previously like...i've been
meeting the coolest people, all the stuff that i originally got into over
four years ago when i went to my first parties has been popping back up
again and i'm glad...the vibe is still there, you just have to search for
it.. sarahs discovered something i've caught on to... the further you go
into the little towns and smaller scenes the tighter the vibe.

this summer, for me, it's all about the midwest....towns like columbus,
dayton, cincy, lexington, lousiville, munice, etc..all get maximum
respect...a big fuck you goes out to everyone (no matter who they are....no
matter how 'BIG') who disses and spreads negativity just cause they have a
pre-conceived notion of what things are like over there. dtroit as always
rocks it...you just have to pick your events carefully...and to see how a
commercial party goes down in the midwest, check out chicago...really
similiar to large scale ultraworld and satellite parties...but with a
different flava...

and these towns are alot closer than u think thanks to cheap
airfare...www.usairways.com (1-888-ESAVERS)has wicked cheap 'e-savers' 
(heheh theres a good joke ;) fares...and 1-800-FLY-CHEAP (1-800-LOW-FARE 
is a diff # for the same service) consistently has the best prices of any 
discount ticket agency i've used over the past 5 years...(travel2000 in the
dc area is another really good service....ask for jason)

so thats my little contribution...do we take ne-raves back underground? if
not people should WISE THE FUCK UP and know whats really going down
here...we arent the same insular community (*unfortunately*) we were four
or five years ago...again, DONT TALK SHIT YOU WOULDNT SAY DIRECTLY TO A
COPS FACE on this list....REMEMBER THAT. if you are willing to say it to a
cop and go to jail, please RESPECT the fact that some of us here wouldnt
necessarily do so. please RESPECT the fact that the shit you say here could
get a party busted and ruin the efforts of not only the promoter's hard
work but the enjoyment of hundreds of kids who were looking forward to the
party.

i hope the scene flourishes this summer in terms of wicked huge parties
with amazing lineups full of international talent, and little vibey
*illegal* parties that build the foundations of this whole thing we call
'rave' (like it or not) again...if you dont have something good to say,
shut the fuck up and focus that energy youd spend on TALKING SHIT and do
somehing POSITIVE...throw a party, print up drug info flyers, smile at a
stranger...don't sit there and cut on the people who have spent YEARS
putting their lives into this scene...if you don't like whats going on, do
something yourself! RESPECT THE EFFORTS of those before you...if all you
have done is bitch about parties, then you really dont have any place to
cut on what others have done...and if you are doing things now...GOOD FOR
YOU...but realise that keeping this damn thing going is hard enuff as it is
with 20/20, the cops, the wack ass shit that ppl are selling as drugs,
etc...we don't need to sit here and cut each other down...if we do, we are
just headed directly into the trap that is being set for us...wise up
people.


peace,
hossam

i have never read anything on ne-raves of value, but ive met a lot of 
awesome people over it.  and in terms of techno related events, i dont 
think ive gone to one thing on the calendar or that i saw on this list in 
so long, so i dont know. it all just seems like one big joke to CONFUSE 
authorities, like we should make up parties and stuff and then trap them 
with like deadfalls and snow caves and police eating animals. and we 
should post LOTS of RAVE 
CALENDARS and LOTS AND LOTS of supersekrit events that are obviously not 
happening, simply by like things ravers would get.

and if we had like 5000 of these posted on ne-raves EVERY weekend night, 
i bet it would keep the authorities frustrated for a little while, well 
it would have to be computed how many of these posts you need to make to 
keep the authorities busy for a complete 48 hours ;) ;)

i have not been on ne-raves in years, and have never resided in the 
general geographic area covered by that list.  if i speak it is with the 
credentials of logic and love and respect for: techno music and the 
underground scene that surrounds it, the electric feeling of pulling off 
an illegal, questionably legal, or even totally legal party where people 
get that electric feeling between and inside themselves that produces a 
smile, a thought and a happy person who carries that little bit of 
happiness out into the world and makes the world a better place to be.

again, not being intimately familiar with ne-raves may or may not be to 
my disadvantage in this discussion but what hossam has stated here is 
totally and absolutely correct, this "rave" thing is no longer 
underground.  and that is not to say that i or even most of us have ever 
known it when it was really like that.  but i have in my fantasy history 
the idea of a day long past when a few kids out in San Francisco, linked 
by techno, technology, and the spiritual insight that life is about 
people would gather after long days in classrooms or offices where they 
changed, or studied about how to change the world.  These events were 
never built up in the minds of the attendees or promoters because they 
did not exist even as ideas until a few hours before they ocurred.  then, 
accross a data line the word went out that yes, a party was happening 
tonight and for those of you who didn't have projects due on monday and, 
fuck it, for those of you who DO -- here is how you get there...  and 
hence, sfraves, hyperreal, vrave and the whole ball of wax.  but now, how 
many of us find out about parties through the internet?  how often are 
these lists any more than a forum to dis promoters and list what dj's 
didn't show for an event?  i mean, are you really hunched over your 
terminal at work or in your dorm room on friday afternoon damning the 
mailqueue for holding up the message with infoline or directions five 
minutes?  no.  probably not.  you've probably got rave flyers littering 
the floor of your car beneath crushed McDonald's bags like i do, and you 
probably haven't been to a party in more than six months that you did not 
have at least two weeks forknowledge that you would be there.

well, that's as close as i want to come to dissing anyone or anything 
here.

my experience with raving has been in two locations:  Nashville,
Tenneessee, and Chicago, Illinois.  in Nashville you do not have a party 
every weekend, in fact, one a month is a lot.  in Chicago, promoters duel 
over dates and kids are force-fed the scene.  in Nashville, if you want 
to party this weekend you're gonna have to *find* a party somewhere in 
the midwest and get enough ppl in a car together to cover the gas money 
and all of ya travel.  the roadtrip forms a bond, the electricity and 
excitement in the car makes ya excited about the party, and once you get 
there meeting all the new peeps makes it a fun time.  did i mention that 
ya hear underground sounds from outerspace on okay to pretty good sound 
systems by deejays who get at least 3/4 of the mixes beatmatched well, 
but are more in love with this sound than you and spend every spare dime 
on mysterious black labels and imports ever in search of that one thing 
that makes thier own soul shiver?  discussion of the way that that 
connects a crowd and a party is saved for you to debate in you own head 
the next time you find your mind focused into a speaker grille...

and because you are, or should be, too tired to drive home immediately 
after, you crash on the floor of friends apartments for a few hours after 
the party.  you can actually get a chance to talk and, if you're lucky, 
discuss things besides just music and parties.  certainly you will 
exchange email addresses and phone numbers, and perhaps make a date to 
have breakfast over vrave on tuesdays.  i'm not talking about two people 
who like to rub one another because they're on copious amounts of MDMA, 
i'm talking about real friends.  and i'm not trying to imply that that 
cannot happen in the larger cities, but two year's experience in Chicago, 
a mecca for ravers and house heads everywhere tells me that it doesn't.

when you come to chicago, come a day (or only hours if it's all you can 
do) and meet some friends.  RSVP gill@topsecret.net  ...and bring your 
records and maybe we'll just get down together, just the few of us.

> so thats my little contribution...do we take ne-raves back underground?

i think so.  i think perhaps just dumping the subscribed and making 
everyone resubscribe would be a start. change the address, or eliminate 
the list completely.  our scene now is large enough to support special 
intrest groups with dedicated lists.  when all the folx on a list do not 
have a common bond, it's time to rethink the purpose of the list and 
perhaps divide it into several.  regional lists could become more 
city-specific, or promotional groups could start thier own lists and 
websites to keep people notified of what is going down in thier circles.  
as as we all know, you should choose carefuly what promotional team you 
support.  perhaps these ideas would do more bad than good, they are, 
after all, just coming off of the top of my head, but perhaps they'll at 
least spur or add to some good discussion.


and i would appreciate being Cc:'d to any replies or discussion that 
occurs onlist or off on this topic, i'm intrested in what happens.

        Well heres how my night went at Intimate. Chris, Wanda, Greta, and
myself left Kent at about 7:30. We picked up Jamie in Akron and then we were
on our way down to Colombus. We got down there pretty quick (this could be
due to the fact that Greta is...well a very aggressive driver).  We got down
there right around 11:00 and we had to wait for a few minutes before they
started letting people in. The location was at a YMCA. Titonton got on first
and of course he ripped up da decks!! What kind of shit does he spin anyhow?
Whatever it is I love it! I think Haiku got on next, and his set was smooth
also.  Next was Trevor Lamont and his set was da bomb. It really got me
movin. And I loved his "down on one knee style"! The next person up was
definitely da highlight of da night. It was MORGAN GEIST!!!!!!!!!!! Dat cat
was da bomb. It was just as phat as it could be, and thats all I gots to say
bout it.  Next up was Carlos. When Carlos got on my night took a turn for
the worse. Greta, while she was dancin, lost the keys to the van that we
came in. She got kind of upset at herself and I was chillin wit her, tryin
to comfort her. So I missed most of Carlos's set. Oh yea I'm not mad at cha
ya Greta! We all make mistakes. From what I did here of Carlos, it was phat
as usual.  Next up was Perry Ellis. His set was smooth, but I was kind of
upset and in a "lets find da keys" mode :) The party ended a half hour
early, I don't know really know why, but it could have been due to the fact
that people were smoking in the building after they asked everyone not to?
When the lights came on we were hoping to find da keys on da ground. We
didn't, but someone turned them at da desk. Whoever turned them in, if your
on this list thank you very much!! So we found da keys and everything was
good, well we faced another problem, the light was left on in the van and
the batery died. So we stuck around and helped clean up in return for a
jump.  Well when it came time to get our jump it wouldn't work.
Aaaaaaaagh!!!!  So me and Wanda got a ride to the after party to hopefully
get a ride off of someone we knew there. Chris and Greta stayed there and
called triple A. I just talked to Chris and he said they made it back safe.
I hope Wanda made back. I got here ride, so I think she did =) I want to
thank Tom for giving me a ride to the afterparty, Tom for trying to give me
jump, and Leslie for giving us da cables. Except for the whole car
situation, it was a totally phat ass night!!!
Sorry bout the length of this post

Political Documentary Meets Seventeenth Century Rave Video

HELIOCENTRUM

Electronic Cinema on a Desktop

The French king Louis XIV may seem like an unlikely subject for a 
computer animation about modern media technology, but that's the 
idea behind an unusual film which has been touring the festival 
circuit. Made by two media artists Jason White and Richard Wright, 
"Heliocentrum" is described as a cross between a political 
documentary and a Seventeenth Century rave video.

Although its tour de force  of state-of-the-art computer graphics 
techniques make it look like it was produced by a high-tech 
facilities house, the twelve minute long film was actually made 
entirely on desktop PCs using a mixture of standard packages such
as 3D Studio and the artists own software. A huge range of digital
imaging techniques were used including 2D and 3D computer animation,
image processing and some very exotic special effects software 
created by the artists. But as they explain dazzling computer 
graphics need not be just a cosmetic gloss added to spice up an 
otherwise dull documentary. In "Heliocentrum" the visual impact 
of the film is both a reference to the culture of the Baroque 
monarchy and a device with which to seduce the viewer.

"'Heliocentrum' is an attempt to find historical precedents for
digital culture which can help us understand our current addiction
to flashy electronic imagery", says Wright.

Louis XIV is famous for creating his huge purpose built palace 
at Versailles from which he established his Absolute Rule which
dominated most of Europe in the seventeenth century. Louis 
controlled his courtiers by forcing them to live in this enclosed
environment effectively isolated from the real world. "In 
Versailles, Louis XIV had realised a 'technology of leisure', 
a kind of virtual reality machine in which his courtiers became
enslaved to pleasure", explains White. Louis took the name the 
"Sun King" as a symbol of his glory which radiated power in all
directions and nourished all parts of the kingdom. The title 
"Heliocentrum" comes from the word "heliocentric" meaning "sun
centred".

In the film, Versailles is represented as a galaxy of techno-
logically enhanced marvels, expressed through a mixture of 
fantastic Baroque decoration and feel-good video effects.

As well as being technically eclectic, "Heliocentrum" experiments
by mixing together different styles and genres. Courtiers, 
sampled from a 1920's Rudolf Valentino movie, are placed in
a computer generated environment more reminiscent of 'Blade
Runner'. In a later scene, shots sampled from Despite TV's 
cult video of the Poll Tax riots are weaved into a virtual 
diorama of London, in which the focus has been shifted from
Versailles to Canary Wharf and the modern power of media 
technology. The soundtrack was produced by Walter Fabeck who 
complements the baroque decor with dense electronic versions 
of chamber music which rise in tempo to a pounding techno 
finale.

"Heliocentrum" was produced through the ANIMATE! scheme, run by the 
Arts Council of England and part funded by Channel Four to encourage
innovative and experimental new animation projects. Twenty-nine films
have been commissioned to date, and the work is showcased in Channel 
Four's celebrated Fourmations series. "The good thing about the 
ANIMATE! scheme is the freedom it allows you by not having a high 
pressure deadline to work for", say the artists. "We couldn't 
afford to employ a big studio to work on 'Heliocentrum', so it 
took us nearly two years to make."

Wright is now working on another ANIMATE! funded production called
"LMX Spiral", which he describes as being about "the transition 
between the enterprise culture of the eighties and the lottery 
culture of the nineties". White is currently animation consultant 
to leading digital media company Studio Fish, working on a major 
realtime 3D game.

"Heliocentrum" will be shown at Londons ICA as part of the 
"Computer World 3" programme on March 17th and 20th at 18:30 
and March 18th and 19th at 20:30.

in st. thomas and other highly populated ragga speaking countries that
speak ragga-type english, the word "SAFE" is a good thing. its sort of the
equivalent to our "FRESH" and/or "DOPE" loosely translated.. now i dont
speak like a rasta man or anything, but i was implying by the statement:

that if u listen to the orb now, its not something as dope as it was back
then..i could be wrong of course..but i havent heard any good things about
the new orb CD and the MTV video is not really enticing at all. :P

	This is really interesting to me since I haven't ben going to parties
full on since 'heaven and hell'. I entered graduate school 5 years ago
haven't had the time to keep up with the scene. I buy occasional records
and keep in contact with it any way possible (like talking to DJ Boomer
and reading the list!)
	If it wasn't for the underground, I wouldn't even bother. This
list keeps me informed and often reminds me of the slammin times back in
the day when Baby Ford played Cleveland! 
	Keep it underground in any way possible, don't let it get screwed
like disco did (remember the Rolling Stones disco trax?). Just lemmie know
how to stay in touch!

so i just got back from spring break yall..and i got 123 emails!!
sorting through the intimate reviews i noticed someone said this party was
all about morgan...but to many like myself it was a subconscious message to
get in shape and stop smoking!!

      it was a change to be at a party where smoking cigarettes was
blatantly not something that is accepted by all memebers of the rave
community, although they seldom get theyre voices heard. i got kicked out
the first time.. YES i did break the rules..it wuz fucking COLD out. and i
lit up again. but this was the first time in awhile i felt bad about
smoking a cigarette even though i know the cops werent about to kick us out
because of it. i ended up smoking less, dancing more and generally having a
good time with lots of friendly people..

i met someone from chicago..sorta strange cuz if i lived in chicago i
wouldve been there to see dj FUNK woohoo!..

id have to agree about the speaker situation..could have been more evenly
distributed through the whole room..the colorful swirly lights were
definate + and the vibe was very very trip friendly. :)

my favorite set was tintonton's second one. this is the second time ive
heard him and he seems to be consistent in wrecking tha faders and crowd
who cant see him at once. to me thats important. he was satisfying the
technique lurkers, curious wanna-be dj's, AND the dancers who just feel the
music simeultaneuosly.

i was right up front next to the right speaker watching morgan start his
set..that was very interesting..he obviously seemed to know what he was
doing. and i was surprised to hear this was his first live set considering
he has records out, but im not sure if the music was appropriate for those
who wanted to get crayzee on the floor at that time..very melodic but it
was more fun to watch and listen to him than to wreckx shop on the floor
to. im obviosly biased cuz i like to listen to harder stuff at 3am than at
5am.

i completely zoned around carlos's set..distracted i guess and perry ellis
wasnt melodic enough for me..

the after party i went to (was it the only one?) was at a nice big house
and i had fun for awhile but things got fishy later on and i just wanted a
ride home but had to wait forever for people to patch certain unhealthy
situations up. i got back to pittsburgh at about midnight saturday not
being able to sleep until then..arghh..but it was a very enlightening and
fun spring break:)

patience was key for me this weekend..

highlight>>
ive figured out a way to quit smoking..repeat
ive figured out a way to quit smoking..

everyone that wants to help u quit tells u a step by step plan on how to
stop, gives u suggestions, etc, but the process of how YOU quit smoking
relies solely on the process in which u started..it simple to
comprehend..and its interesting to investigate ones past, so it could be
fun to do, or "undo" i should say.

its a cyclical theory based on completing an emotional, physical, social,
and intellectual circle, in the opposite order in which you started
smoking. us smokers have all started having only one of these types of
attachments to smoking, perhaps having only a social inclination to smoke.
then we grow to learn why it feels good (intellectual), why we do it to
satisfy a feeling (emotional), and when we do it (unconscious), but not
neccessarily in that order.

so im going back in time resketching which attachments i aquired first and
how, then balancing things with opposite types of actions. for instance, i
started steadily smoking just after i started bumming from people..i had my
social attachement to smoking culminate first, so my last step in this
process would be to give cigarrettes back to people i bum from regularly or
just generally offer people around me cigarrettes, thus undoing my initial
actions. someone else would break down the rest of their addictions much
differently but the point is that if the process of becoming addicted
occurs in stages, then seperating and completing these stages as phases in
reverse chronological order, like a pallindrome (sp?), would be the most
logical way to quit..im going to be lucky this time cuz i got a four leaf
clover sticker from a very very lucky person..
(you need a little faith too)

happy belated st. patty's day lads!

-------------------------------
with all due respect thats not a safe assumption, although i can relate to
and see your point of view..this is not a rebuttal, but just my perspective
and im speaking to anyone out there who would like to hear someone who
thinks rave lists aren't the problem we are talking about..
here goes>>

        i think party kids like myself find great ease and use finding out
about parties all over without having to make a long distance phone calls.
in reality this form of communication (since i get email free for being a
college student) has saved me hard earned $$ not haveing to make a long
distant phone call to arrange to meet someone or in organizing efforts for
anyone else interested in ideas..i find out about parties over the internet
a lot..just last thursday i was wondering what was going down on the
weekend so i went to vrave and asked a respected promoter that was online
what was going down,..now i can get his opnion and skoop without picking up
a flyer or making a phone call (mind u i dont have his phone number and
MAYBE he prefers it that way. ;) all of this one day before the party...no
hassle...belive me....party people like me benefit from lists such as these
and some of us lose flyers or dont even get em. thats not my fault..no one
is at fault..the point is the internet DOES do some good in the raveworld
and is here to stay.
        the internet can be dangerous if ideas presented are skewed and
taken out of context.. but pleaz dont tell me that we should get rid of a
very useful forum to MOSTLY OUR TYPE OF PEOPLE becuz its serving some
member(s) improperly with rumors and bad news. the source of that shit is
BEHIND THE KEYBOARD..and ne-raves is NOT the primary source of that. and

IF ITS NOT A PRIMARY SOURCE ITS NOT THE SOURCE AT ALL!!!

now im gonna cop an atiitude for the fuck of it to get my agreessions and
opinions heard. hit the delete key if u changed your mind and dont wanna
see me frontin the truth how i see it..im glad u came this far with me=] i
say this from respect from people that want to see the vibe without hearing
what im sayin..but its time to LISTEN if yall r down..

-----this is where it gets deep or where it starts sounding like a gangstah
rap song, which ever u prefer..>

shit; fools who be dissin the internet cuz its caused them embarrassment or
even a drug bust should get in check and wonder how it got there in the
first place. cops can spot an attitude a mile away and if u frontin an
attitude and saying shit thats not your business u maybe dont deserve to
get busted but u cant blame it on an email message, becuz that shit can
happen just that easy over any mode of communication possible....shit; a
drug dealer can get busted without saying anything..is that the fault of
the air that he saw it though for letting a cop see a drug deal happen ??
silly rationale people...accidents happen and cops see more than just rave
flyers and happy smiliey spiritually enlightened people associated with the
rave scene...OBVIOUSLY they wanna know where the party is at. hyperreal and
and internet providers fostering growth among netfriendly ravers know they
cannot be liable for things u say through their servers. they want u to say
anything u wanna say..do u really wanna say what ur saying if it could
cause people time in jail or even get someone arrested??

perhaps these lists make it easier for a cop at a desk to find out whats
going on and whos responsible, but if its a legal event whos to worry?? and
if its an illegal party..maybe the promoters should have decided HOW
underground they want their party to be B4 they designed their flyers and
gave them to people they dont know really well. a flyer with a phone number
is just as valuable to a cop than an email with a phone number; troo the
email or website is just easier to find than a flyer, but like mr. top
secret sed, we all have rave flyers...FUCK THAT WE EVEN LITTER THEM AT
PARTIES!!! whose to say a cop isnt looking at one right now!!!!
the future of underground relies on a different form of communication than
the written word of english on the net, but i dont know if i want to be a
part of that if everyone is just wanting to be exclusive.

lets face it..we all see shade..we can spot it amile away..and so can
cops..and i see a lot of shade in the idea of censoring a list supposedly
open to all.

 *if u want to have an exculisive conversation dont go to the internet!!*

this is one of the last places to be unaffected by the selling out of our
free rights to freedom and expression and communication. lets keep it that
way. no one but your name and email adress can really be liable for what is
written in this medium, so the moral is WHATCH WHAT U FUCKING SAY, cuz you
dont really know whos gonna read it. i think thats common sense.

        my humble opinion on this subject is that ne-raves (although i am
like mr. top secret and have not read shit from it in while, but ive posted
flyers for parties that i hoped someone bored might look at and actually be
interested)
is not the problem people r talking about. period.
repeat:

NE_RAVES IS NOT THE PROBLEM WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

        weve been talking about wheter or not we should hide the shade we
obviously have. if shade is the source of these alleged problems i know
nothing about, then maybe certain people should realign their signals to
understand that when they hit send on the corner of their little message
they typed with much love that people will criticize it, people will laugh
at it, people might even talk about u. and people may even remeber it
*ohmigosh*

lets hear my choir sing:
people will call u names *ohmigosh*
nevermind that if u want to be heard.
theyre all gonna laugh at you *ohmigosh*
nevermind that if u want to be heard.

if yall got some shade to boast but cant deal with not being accepted by
everyone, shut up and go home please, youre only hiding youre true self
from your name foo.

why iz it we always gotta be universally exclusive?
like we have the last word and the best word and the newest word all at once.
we wanna feel loved and we like to think we have friends and we like to say
their names..but if u talk shit on a bruthah than u rollin dice with
another computer out there..

and like 2pac im not mad at ya anyof yall..im just letting my own
aggression  roll with these fucked up allegations that ne-raves is a source
to any drug busts or the _PRIMARY_ cause of why one ot more of any of us
got busted...

the source is behind the keyboard..this connection is just a catalyst in
interacting ideas with the world..and for most people its a positive thing,
including myself.

oh yeah, if u cant controlling the primary source, then controlling the
secondary source is obviously not going to stop shade from being
communicated. it might stop it from being on ne-raves. but that because
youve stopped ne-raves in an attempt to stop future bad things that
cultivated in it. but like a worm its gonna crawl back underground and go
somewhere else..

SO...what if God so graciously saw this foreshading in a dream on the
seventh day and mumbled in his sleep "LET THERE BE SHADE" maybe ne-raves is
a good place to have it.


whoa that was deeep

*burps and farts*

oh yeah....

and if i offended u..



FUCK YOU

wooohooo=]
yO want a warning?? yall got one back in the day somewhere
maybe even yO mommy warned u about me biOtch....
muhahahahahaahhahahahah

and if yall still looking for something to believe in

THIS MESSAGE MIGHT:

*self-destruct in 10 seconds*

*give you the HIV virus*

*give you reallly bad luck*

*make u nautious*

*be from the devil*

..

..

Explode yet????!




REMEMBER YOU CHOSE TO READ THIS FOOL

alright,

i'd just like to know if anyone else has noticed the *large* amounts of
crossposts on the lists lately.  dj's from oklahoma city, atlanta, florida
and other states and cities that are no where near us announcing they have
tapes on sale for $5, $10 and the like.  and who can forget the king of all
crossposts, DJ HARDWARE!  he's got numorous cd's for sale at best buy for
pete's sake, you'd figure he of all people wouldn't need it!  a year or so
of his crossposts and he *finally* got *one* midwest booking.  

anyhow, i just wanted to hear anyone else's opinions on crossposting (mainly
the ones that advertise "hi i'm so and so from somewhere very far away and
my tape is 'x' amount of dollars......book me!).  am i the only one who gets
very bothered by these?

They should create a seperate list for the nationwide Industry (deejays,
promotors, record stores, etc) rather than drowning the regional lists
that are more oriented for the ravers and the local scene. I think it'd
be helpful to create such a list to  get people from other regions
sharing their wares (mixtapes, records, etc) and it can pull together a
more centralized underground market-place rather than one that is
fragmented; I suppose that others like me would be interested in these
things especially if we can't get them locally. This internet is
supposed to centralize things, and serve as a bound-less communications
line isn't it? But I agree with what you said, we shouldn't drown the
pb-cle-raves when it's all about the region first and foremost.

This has all been done, from what I gather...
fake info lines, fake directions, etc.

I propose the idea that we all get decoder rings, so we can encrypt 
directions to parties!  Only give the rings to your friends, and those 
who you know to not be feds, narcs, gangstas, dealers, planet x 
supporters, etc.

Hehehehehee...  the greyfacen must go nuts every time they hear about a 
"super krad underground rave."

"Oh, no...  will we have to walk into the women's room at Metropol to 
find the next leg of the trip again?"

"No, officer Davis."

"Whew."

"_You're_ going in there to find the directions."

Actually, that's not too difficult.  I happen to have, on the back of 
Fringeware #9, a system not unlike that.  Sure, it's pure cheese, but 
when they see 'PGP', they'll try to figure out what THAT is (no, it isn't 
PGP, but a smokescreen), and waste weeks...  If desired, I could scan it 
and post it on my web page to perpetuate the shen.

What about Galifreyan supporters?  <blinky>

...wait wait wait a second...

I've got to stick up for the orb here! now, it's not your regular music,
but their new album (orblivion) DEFINATLY gets 4 stars in my book. The
two "jungle" tracks aren't your average jungle, but nothing like it has
ever been done before, and if you can't chill with ambient, that's cool
too, because this album's got phat beats!

Good idea!  We need more creativ ideas like das!

How about this:

  We should write the directions on the sheets of rolls of toilet paper,
and place them in strategic, unused bathrooms throughout the city.  One
roll will lead to another.  After a few spots, the lil' paper will lead
you to the final happy party location (perhaps in a bathroom?).  This will
limit the number of people to those deadicated to findin the fun.  I'd
suggest 2-ply though.

Hmmmm...  the 'worst toilet in Scotland' effect?  That might work, 
barring someone having to dash after hot wings or some such, in which 
case, the directions will be going bye-bye.  Perhaps erasable marker 
could be used on the reverse side of the door or on the side of the bowl 
alternativly.

Now that would be cool.  People would be bouncing up and down on the 
seats like there's no tomorrow.

And strong-stomached.  :)  Perhaps writing the directions INSIDE the 
cardbord core would work...  kind of like a kaliedescope.

well, to all of you who said the Daft Punk release wasn't going to be
significant because it hadn't even been released domestically, i give you this:


           DAFT PUNK - Homework lp

           Release Date: March 25th, 1997

           Label: Virgin USA


if you recall, i said i would gurantee it's domestic release within 6 months
but it looks like it was even sooner than i thought...

anyhow, onwards to more ice picking nazi talk....

Hey y'all Pixburghers...

	Lava Lounge just called me and asked me to fill in their Thursday 
night slot.  So, tomorrow I'll be spinning some Jungle alongside the 
Grrl13, and DJ UMMMM will spin some nice nice techno and electro on the 
illbient tip.  Hope to see some peeps there.

Lava Lounge is at 26th and E. Carson St. on the South Side.  And, as is 
typical in this lame commonwealth, you need 21+ ID to get in.  I wish 
everyone had a cage like Laga to corral us old beer drinkin' folks in so we 
could party with the youngins in peace :-)

Anyways ... hope to see some of you there.

laters,
Toby

Is this any different than the version on Virgin France or not?  It'd be a
complete waste if it wasn't since everyone and his dog already has the
French version.  Oh well...

ha...let me know if you find any.

all's I know about is Johnny B Goode's, above Hollowood Music in Mckee's =
Rocks (I think)...interesting used-gear store...I've only been there a =
small handful of times, and the only sampler I've seen there of note was =
a rackmount Emax II.

Also look in the yellow pages for pawn shops...I've been meaning to go =
pawn shop hunting, but never seem to find the time...

Lookin' to buy a sampler, huh?  Me too, although not very seriously at =
the moment (no $$$, no time, and no place to put it).  I've been =
interested in Akai S900/950's, especially since a band-mate =
(sideproject: venusinfurs--local alterna-industrial-dance-crap...ever =
heard of us?) has and uses one.  I've seen s900's go used for as low as =
$350 on the net.
Emax I's and II's are supposed to be really nice, too, for the price =
point.  I's seem to sell for $500-600 used...II's go for more.  Prophet =
2000/2002's are supposedly excellent, too, for around $500-600, but make =
sure that they've got the 8-output expansion.

hope that helps..

I think it sux, there don't seem to be enought parties in Cleveland
anyways and I'd like to make it to both...Ohwell..I dunno about soiled but
I wouldn't expect the Tuffest to be more than $10, they're party's have
been pretty cheap..well, at least they aren't like 25-30 :)

I guess I'll go where the people are...so who's going to which party? :)

sounds like pittsburgh. the best parties are free, and the worst, well, 
the worst are about 15-18 bucks. it's like what people used to pay for 
concerts. I'd rather have decent musik than some spinny laser thingy that 
gets boring after one hour.

well here's what i've heard, there's a guy who writes for the free times
that comes into the record shop on a reg basis. anyhow, he's interviewed
shadow a couple of times prior to this upcoming event and figured he'd
speak with him again. well he called his management co. and they insist
that he is not playing cleveland for he is getting ready for an actual tour
that starts in new york sometime next week.  so again, this is just what
i've heard as well as others.

O.K., one more addition to the Lava Lounge thang that I was asked to 
assemble at the last minute...

Grrl13 (Jungle)
Ummmmm (Illbient)
Farmer (Jungle)
1.8.7. (Mic Control)
xxxxxx (kinda neat how the spacing for our names all lined up, hunh ;-)

Last time Joe and I were at the Lava Lounge was fairly interesting,
hopefully tonight will be as fun.  Nothing like spinning techno to a crowd
of Frat Boys who normally expect to hear alternative rock :-) Don't worry,
we still create our sets with our usual flair of artifice, and try to
ignore the requests for "something good, like Big Audio Dynamite, Prodigy,
or Chemical Brothers."

I agree with you saying that most parties should be 10 bucks, but some of
our shows (psychoactive/spawntaneous) couldn't possibly be that cheap!! for
this years 420 we would need 2800 people at $10 just to cover the Dj line
up!!! So please let it be stated that some, and I do only mean "some"
partys could be worth the $. As for which party to go to, Alex (Tic Tak) is
a Cleveland oldskooler, loves the C-town sceen, these other guys, ?????,
and the most insulting thing about them, there voice mail actually says,
"come on Cleveland were trying to help you out!" Ummm , Ahhhh Help in what
way?? Are they trying to insinuate that thier doing something new?? Let's
see, thier using one of our spaces and booked dj's that Chris and I have
had here like 3 times. Yea I get it???? Help Cleveland.... I think we can
cut it on our own. If I would be in town for this 2 party weekend, I would
go to Alex's party, he's down. (ps. phantom 45 is probably the best jungle
Dj I have ever heard!- so check him out!!)

Peace & respects,

Speaking of them Darfd Punx, anyone see their video on MTV's AMP for "Da
Funk"...its pretty cool, in fact one of my favorite videos of all-time
(though I never watched the mtv much).  It has this guy like McGruff the
crimedog, and he's walkin' through some sort of NYC neighborhood with his
boombox, blastin the tune, and bad stuff keeps happening to him.  It
totally rocks the other McBoring AMP videos.

THE RUFFEST was $15 ($13 w/ canned food) and didn't have as good of a lineup
as this one, so i guarantee it will either be the same or more.  don't
forget they are getting real lights and sound this time as well...

not to mention that these other guys who are putting on SOILED are getting
the SJU, who were all at 720 and *also* performed live.  not to mention 720
had a slew of other big names and talent.  i'll bet the cost difference will
be slim nonetheless.  as long as the people keep coming, they will keep
chargin.  btw while 420 and other physcoactive assoc. events are highly
priced, you *know* that money is well spent just by looking at the names
(not to mention over the top lighting/lasers/sound).  i was speaking of
rehashed rehashed rehashed junk coming to our city again and again and again
and these people just EAT IT UP.  anyhow, that's just my take.

but here's my one comment the next 420.  MORE LIVE GLASS BLOWING! :D
heh...i swear that was the nuttiest thing i ever saw.

	At the vernal equinox, the new GRID on hyperreal.com
	was dropped into place. Weee-haw!

	So what's new? 



	1. Added More Categories: 

	Besides Weekly and Special Events, there are now categories
	for Home Pages, Radio Stations, Clubs, Info Lines, and Stores.

	2. Calendar modes:

	There are two calender modes for viewing events. The "Calendar"
	mode displays a few months with events listed in the appropriate
	day. The "Event List" is a top down list of events that include 
	geographic information like Town, State/Province, and Country.

	3. Expand Coverage Globally:
	
	We tried to make expansion for more Regions a lot easier. As a
	result, when an area "deserves" it's own section, it can be
	done. For instance, I'd like to see the "Europe" section evolve
	into "France", "Germany", etc ...

	4. Provide ROM service:

	The ROM is a historical acronym for "Rave-O-Matic". Some lists
	have a person or group of people organize a weekly mail that 
	lists all the upcoming events. Well, since the GRID collects
	announcements from the public, why not aid in ROM development.

	5. [Technical] Separated Editing and Viewing Functionanility: 

	Viewing GRID items required a CGI-script to fetch data and format
	output at you. Now, the site is less "virtual". Essentially, there
	are "physical" pages to read now, rather than wait for PERL to 
	spit text at you.


	
	Note: For areas under attack by media and police actions ...

	One last thing, if your information is considered "underground" or your
	area has come upon a period of "Raver Inquisition", then perhaps
	you don't want to list that particlar event here.  Recently, more
	and more negative media has surfaced about the Rave Culture. Labeling
	us as drug addicted deviants is something we'd like to shed, but
	like most any type of party, albeit a college fraternity or a big
	business merger celebration, drugs tend to appear. So, please
	consider what repercussions could occur. You never know where Big
	Brother is watching but Hyperreal.com is a fairly good magnet for
	his surveillance drones. We at Hyperreal.com want to help the Rave
	Culture communicate and flourish but we'd also like to prevent
	becoming a surveillance device for troubled regions. Just give it
	a thought.


	Enjoy,	
	-Eric and Hank

I definatly agree with you, and apologize for not stating that in my
orgional post, didn't mean any disrespect to you or anyone else :)  I
realize that for large scale productions, more funds are needed, and when
you think about it..if you go to a rock concert (for 3-4 hours, to see 2-3
or so bands play...) you're likely to spend at least $20 a ticket..So
shouldn't a party (all night, many dj's, lots of cool ass people, etc)
also be worth that much? just a thought...

just a comment, but how can you compare a rock concer to a rave? at a rock
concert, the crowd is pretty much guaranteed depending on the star, for
example, if you bring U2, the promoter doesn't have to wonder if people will
show up to his event. Your ticket price should be reflective of what you are
receiving, and so they are. People think that raves are too epensive, but
they dont think about the expense of a rave. Seldom do promoters walk away
with mad money, unless they are veterans. There is the initial expense of
the lineup, the location, the shuttle bus (if there is one) flyers, which
can be anywhere from 500$ to 6,000$, hotels for the artists, and many many
hidden expenses that one does not even think of, like the amount of gas the
promoter has to put into his or her car shuttling around doing assorted
things, the postage to send out tickets and flyers to stores, etc etc etc..
these little things add up, and they ADD UP... 

so anyway, i used to be of the attitude that parties should be cheaper, and
20$-25$ is rather steep and is all the fault of "money hungry promoters",
and then i threw a party and realised why parties are so expensive. and when
you think about it, you're there for say, 8-10 hours on the average, you get
to hear 3-4 djs at least, so you really are getting your moneys worth (:.

just a quick intro.

i moved to cleveburg at the end of december, but i've been so damn busy with 
my
new job that i'm just finding time to check out the scene.  (haven't seen 
many
flyers... hmm.)

i'm 25, went to my first rave in 93 and have been producing tracks since 90. 
 i've
got a small record label for my personal projects though i might look to 
expand
it in the future.  i released my first 12" in november 96 but my moving 
here, totally
fucked up distribution so only about 200 got distributed.

i spin crunchy acid and hard house, heavy on the acid.  =P

so anyway, i'm a plurry kind of guy, but i don't get in anybody's face about 
it.

if anyone has any info on the scene here i'd greatly appreciate it.  i'm 
dying to hit
a party soon so please help!

gracias

[just a comment, but how can you compare a rock concert to a rave?]

whats the difference again?? :P~

seeing the chemical brothers live at a rave type setting such as BUZZ in dc
(which ive heard is now shutdown) made me see the future morph into rave
concerts. go to germany and see the same type of music being blasted to
30,000 people which is more than the average concert...

with that many people at an event, regardless of the star dj or star
singer, methinks some sort of parallels can be drawn between the future of
rave and the status of rock concerts. I forget where i heard this but
somewhere in europe the event of the century is being planned for about
150,000 people....
thats more than just another party wouldnt we say?

that was my two sense,:)

Well, they are basicaly the same. People into rock music go to concerts to
hear their music live, and we go to raves to hear our music live..granted
there is alot more to a rave than a concert (I think raves are much more
of a "social event" where people tend to interact more with eachother).

I think it's just that in the past year or so, parties have become larger
in general, and even the smaller parties have large expenses..

I think this could be a really constructive conversation, if people
realize what all goes into a rave, and why some events may seem
overpriced.  I really liked what they did at Intimate in columbus; they
handed out small flyers detailing the budget of the party when you paid,
showing how much money was put into the party, and how many people they
needed to attend to break even.

well yeh true, but i was talking more on the promoter tip. (: as in what
they have to go thru, and how the stresses are probably really different and
emphasis is put on completely differnt areas and such.. but you know, i dont

well, i dont know about how it is in pittsburgh or cleveland since i'm in
toronto, but here the smaller parties are still cheap and the bigger parties
are still expensive.. but there's a big difference between a small party and
a big party, something like 3,000-4,000 people and international dj's.

thats a really good idea, (: heeh.

but you know, i agree. i dont think that people who go to parties understand
what goes into one at all. it's not something you just throw together, it's
sooo stressful and aggravating, and you just want to beat people up for no
reason, (well maybe taht's just me (:  )... but for example i can tell you
about how suddenly two weeks before my party i had hundreds of "best
friends" who wanted to get into my party for free... as much as i would love
to throw free parties, we live in a capitalist society where things cost
money people need retribution, and letting a hundred people into my party
for free just isn't gonna happen... and it really bothered me that people
would come to the door and demand to be let in for free because two months
ago they took 30 flyers from me and pretended to hand them out but actually
just took them home and stuck them on their wall.. well gee, i flyer 2,000+
a nite and what do i get? hmm... nothing?
but it's not an anger thing, it's just that i wish people would realise that
it costs money and i'm not a bitch because i wont let you in, it's just
basically that i have to pay the sound people so that there will be SOUND
and i have to pay the dj's so that you can DANCE... 


just my gripes (:

in case you haven't seen this yet...a very experimental lineup for a very
cheap price, located in a virgin warehouse space here in columbus this 
friday mar 28.
  
if you like events that challenge your mind and body, and if you like the
old-school underground flavor (before parties were $20 every week!!), then
this is the event for you. 

(N): NITROGEN, the 7th ele_ment concert event, begins at 9.30 PM with 4
live performances, starting with the more passive/listening music of SPINE
and the WEIRD LOVE MAKERS, then building into the beautiful dance music of
MYUNGHO CHOI and the driving techno of POWERHOUSE as THE SLEEP ENGINEER
(guaranteed to keep you awake). 

following the live performances, the event continues with DJs such as
toronto's techno minimalist, ADAM MARSHALL, our own jungle-funkster
ANDROMEDA and house/techno old-schooler TIM MADONNA, a mixed bag of beats
by kent's ELIAS (aka greta!!), and ruff jungle by columbus' LIVID. 

all this for only $5 before midnight, or $7 after.

location information: the space is tentatively a small warehouse located
very close to the short north gallery district, just north of downtown
columbus, which has never been used for an event.  heat (if needed) will
probably not be the greatest but it is a comfortable space otherwise. 

detailed directions will be posted on thursday, or call the table of 
ele_ments voicemail for more details: 614.470.0929.

If so, please email response to: JohnnyT123@aol.com as it's almost time to go

    --------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings From Toronto, Canada.

Well, well, well.. it sure has been a while since our last e-newsletter.
In fact, the last posting from our end was over the Christmas holidays.
That puts us, um.. well, three months past deadline.  Sorry folks.  

But, as we all know, January and February can be two of the slowest months
of the year.  To others, its also the coldest.   Needless to say, in order
to prevent our brains from freezing, weve been cooking up a few things to
keep us warm and toasty.

The Atomic Kids Explode Again !
------------------------------------------------

Im pleased to officially announce that Kinder Atoms second release, Super
Nice Hippy Pants, is now available  internationally and we want to celebrate !

... this is what we have to say about it....

Come join Torontos acclaimed techno scientists, Kinder Atom at the new
intimate & electronic music venue, FLUX.  Located at 783 Queen Street West
in Toronto, Canada, the party takes place this Friday, March 28.  Doors
open at 21:00, admission is only $7.

Kinder Atoms new double-cd digipak release, Super Nice Hippy Pants
(Cleopatra/Hypnotic USA) represents a solid year worth of recording at the
nice+smooth ultra media facility.

SUPER NICE, disc one, is a lush 74-minute continuously mixed ambient
soundscape that falls in and out of whispered melodies and forgotten love
themes.  A culmination of tracks recorded in dreamtime by the group, Super
Nice features recorded encounters with para-dimensional entities as well as
experiments in subliminal brain wave synchronization techniques.  Two of
the pieces from the album, Gamelan and Scammer, were recorded lived to air
on Toronto radio station CKLN-FMs Unfortunate Sonic Casualties program
(Wednesday night 12 am - 2 am on 88.1 FM)

HIPPY PANTS, disc two, is the type of material heard at many of Kinder
Atoms recent live performances, i.e. hard-hitting, in your face, pounding,
organic technodelia, as well as a solid dose of downbeat tracks with
booming bottom ends.  The first cut, Run in our Light, is a foray into the
jazzier, more experimental side of drum n bass and moves on into the
trip-hop flavor of Phat Pants, remixed from the recent compilation TRIP
INTO DUB.  The title track Hippy Pants, is a psychedelic techno groove
followed by the screaming chemical beats and tweaking acid lines of Nipple.
 Stop and have a drink in Kinder Atoms electro-funk Juice Bar before
heading home with the minimalist inspired finale, Nikral.

Heres what you have had to say about it....

Kinder Atom, (Super Nice - Hippy Pants) 
Hypnotic USA, 2CD $20, 16 trax, 134m  

It looks like a Koolaid package but it's actually the latest American
release from the nice + smooth production team, who've recently remixed
rapper Snow and reggae artist Mykael Rose. 

Within the lime green and tangerine coloured double digi-pak are two
disparate CDs of ambient/electronic (Super Nice) and techno-hip hop (Hippy
Pants). The Kinder kidz join Cleopatra's catalogue of space rockers with
Super Nice's electronic anti-gravity experiments that sound like UFOs
launching ("Scammer"), Zoviet France ("Evergreens") and a noisier Tangerine
Dream ("Gamelan"). On a less reverbed note is Hippy Pants' rhythmic tracks
that range from jungle-dub ("Run In Our Light") to an acid-hip hop mix
("Nipple"), to Legion Of Green Men-style trip hop ("Phat Pants"). The
grooves get funky on the space-jamming electro-hip hop track "Juice Bar",
which sees this improvising group at it's most focused point.  A
schizophrenic release perhaps, but at a single CD price it's your choice
whether you like your music in outer space or on the dancefloor.

				- Chris Twomey (COSTAN@fis.utoronto.ca)


The digi-dawgs return
---------------------

Yes its true -- Digital Poodle have returned to bark up a storm on their
brand-new extended play single (57 minutes!) featuring ruff and funky
tracks direct from the doghouse. Included is two mixes of COMBAT, the
vocoder driven techno-industrial stomper with deep sub-bass for the
dancefloor.  Also featured is the standout distorto-chemical beats track
from the Nekrology compilation, FUNKASS.  Youll howl at the bone breaking
edit of 1993's rare track METAL FIGHT !  and foam at the mouth for the
Smokin-new-PCP laced-version of CRACK (released originally on vinyl through
UK's NINJA TUNE label).

Techno tricksters KINDER ATOM provide a whole new look to the unreleased
Poodle track BUTCH, a mean electro booty track.  Also added is a bonus edit
of the 1993 rarity, RED STAR.

The Combat EP is available through Cleopatra/Hypnotic as well as Caroline
Records internationally.  Digital Poodles yet untitled full length release
will be out later in the year.

Several shows are presently being lined up in support of the release.
Well let you know soon enough.

Canada Music Week Wrap Up
-------------------------------------------

Thanks to all of you who attended our Canada Music Week showcase at
Industry (March 9th, 1997).  It was great to put some faces to e-mails.
Aside from a few minor technical sound problems and the lighting guy
falling asleep on the job... the night was quite a success.    The night
started with a solid 3.5 hours of drum & bass featuring Mystical Influence,
Sniper and Visionary before shifting gears to the technodelia organics of
Kinder Atom, Ollie and Huren.   The folks at Industry liked Kinder Atoms
visual team so much that theyve been hired to provide mind numbing treats
on a weekly basis (on Saturday nights).

By the way, thanks go out to Slyther for the extremely cool TR808 t-Shirt.
For more information on these and other t-shirts, contact him at
slyther@aol.com.

Fruity Techno Loops ?
--------------------------------

This may come as a bit of surprise to some of you.  Next time youre
munching breakfast while watching the morning cartoons... pay attention to
an advert for Fruit Loops with a groovy 303/808 loop playing in the
background.   That 10 seconds of rave music (thats what it was referred
to by the agency who developed the advert) is none other than the track
SPACE LAXATIVE taken from Kinder Atoms debut release, Atomika.  

A state of FLUX
-----------------------

As mentioned earlier in this post, Toronto now has a weekly live electronic
music night worth investigating.  Located on the second floor of 783 Queen
Street West (West of Bathurst, East of Claremont) FLUX is an intimate
gathering that showcases and highlights the diverse talent of Canadian
electronic musicians.  The venue also acts as a center for people of
like-minds to meet and network together in a public forum on a weekly
basis.  For booking and other inquiries contact Justin from alien
Visitation at 416-760-3132 or alien@passport.ca.  Upcoming shows include :

Kinder Atom 		- March 28th 	(maximalism)
Mario J		- April 4th	(house)
Algorhythm/Troll	- April 11th	(weird electronic)
Auracle		- April 18th	(down tempo electronica)
Ollie			- April 25th	(minimal techno)
Altitude		- May 2nd	(deep Detroit technohouse)
Huren			- May 9th	(electro minimal bliss)

We have lots more to tell you including information on new releases, other
show dates and what some of affiliated labels are up to.  All this and more
in our next posting.

All the best and take care..

Word trouty!  Bein a poor pseudo-social-anarchist type kid, the
spontaneous, collectiv and cheap nature of some of the early raves I went
to were a big part of the attraction.  That people can come together using
our collective technology and imagination and have a unique experience.
Major props to Projecthaus, Elemental and ov course the Jive Turkeyz
(an others all over the place) for keeping the DIY ethic to ravin'!! :)

sure, i agree, a party CAN be thrown on a small budget. but will it be a
good party? hmm, sure why not... will the promoter be able to bring in
bigname dj's that will 1. make the attendees happy, 2. ensure a turnout to
his or her party, and 3. help the dj themself thru exposure?? Nope. not on a
budget of 1,000.00. 

throwing a party isn't just about being a fun person and throwing some shit
together and having a good time; it's much more than that. a promoter is a
business person who has to look at all the issues; MONEY being the biggest
one. if i had a thousand dollars that i could just throw away and it
wouldn't hurt me financially, hell, i would throw a party and not worry
about the turnout. but if i have to account for that 1,000.00 at the end of
the night, i'm gonna make sure that my party will be able to draw the amount
of people i need to cut even. 

if you look at it psycholgically, if you have a big flyer, and high ticket
prices, people will think it's a big party and more will come. if you have a
small party and small flyers less peopel will come. the bigger you print
dj's on the flyer, the more people will think they are a kickass dj. 

once again let me point out that promoters ARENT making ca$h all the time. i
dont know how it is in pittsburgh and cleveland, but there aren't many
companies in toronto who made money on their first party. (let alone
second.) And the companies that are making money are the ones who have been
at it for a long long time, and even they suffer losses every now and again.

do i think that the money that some promoters make is justified? yes i do.
people underestimate what is involved in throwing a party, and if you talk
to any promoter you will see that it's a helluva lot of work and stress.
Anyway, that money they make usually just goes back to throw more parties.

That's exactly my point :) I understand why some parties are so expensive,
but I don't understand why so many parites have to be like that.  Sure,
all the big stuff is great, but a small party with minimal extras can be
just as satisfying at half the cost :)

a lot of smaller budget parties rely on promotion tactics other than ones
you can pay for. trendy or recognizable dj's and a flyer made by Joel can
ensure plenty of kids to come, but this just sort of a luxurious way to do
that. It creates a higher status of your reputation without doing anything
but pay more money to let people know your in the business. To me thats
fine and once in awhile ill support or promote big parties in the area such
as Journey to Delphi. But, Big flyers will only get u so far. Hype is best
taken as truth through a friendly conversation with a promoter talking
about his or his friends party than through a big ass flyer shoved in your
face. THat will never change.
AND can u deliver the hype as huge as you printed it?? thats something that
has to do more with your long term reputation and less to do with your
credentials. if you dont front anything and invite as many people as u can
with enthusiam and confidence youll draw as many people as u need, and the
hype comes naturally, regardless of flyer size and dj names.
also, you can defend having a good time much easier than defending being
the best raver u can be, whatever that means nowadayz.

        im with trout and geoff on this one. Rock on fellow brethren. Dont
belive tha hype is a sequel..hehe.

i dont feel that that is luxurious, i feel it's just being precautious and
careful. think of it as "insurance" kind of.

yep, but honestly, have you tried promoting a party by word of mouth? it
isn't as easy as it sounds. believe me i've tried it. between me and my
partner i think we talked to thousands of people about our party, but you
can't rely on that. people will forget. things happen.. im' just saying,
that a promoter cant rely on only one or two forms of promotion; they have
to use everything. any number of factors can lead to the demise of a party.
you could have the phattest lineup and have promoted your party perfectly;
thru word of mouth and flyering and everything, but if there's a storm that
nite, people aren't going to come out. 

raves are very unpredictable from the point of view of a promoter; you can't
predict how many people you'll get, no matter what kind of event you're
throwing.

once again, maybe because i'm in toronto where there are 2-3 parties every
saturday, and the competition is fierce, you can't just leave it to word of
mouth.

in principle i think that parties should be cheap and fun and devoid of
hype, but realistically they are not. raves are big business...they can mean
a great windfall or debt for several years. personnally i just want to cut
even and throw a kickass party that everyone will be impressed with,
although i'm sure that there are promoters that dont share my opinions. i
wish i could throw small jams and charge 5$ and have a nice space and nice
sound and not have to feel it in my pocket the next day, but the reality is,
i WILL if i dont take the proper precations beforehand.

anybody from the pgh area willing to go to this? i'd be more than happy to
pay my share of gas + tolls...fyi, phantom is probably one of the most
wicked jump-up dj's you'll hear/see anywhere in the states...mad skills and
a dope selection makes the crowd dance *every time*...as well as the
opportunity to check out some of the san fran flavor with UFO and
abstract...two skilled dj's in their own right....not to mention that chump
andy/sine...;) one of pgh's most skilled dj's...



btw...i personally want to thank each and everyone of you who went to get
down and whooped it up during dieselboy's set....you made it so much fun...
i was kinda undercover on the mike (hardly anyone knew where i was
standing, and thats the way i like it...the music is the focus) but trust
me, i saw you all and when i asked for the noise and you came with it...you
kids made my night :) respect.


so who wants to help a brother out and help me get to this party...i just
want to hear some good tunes and maybe go for it on the mike once again this
weekend...we'll just see if cleveland has got the stamina...i know
pittsburgh sure as hell does ;)


peace,

you're only as good as your latest hit...


in the least, it seems that's what i'm getting out of the current thread. 
I don't know if it could be more or less true with the scene. In pop 
music it's a little bit different, but at least here you can start it up 
without a following. people show up to party. I don't really think it 
matters what the dj's do out there (sorry 187, farmer tea... etc) but 
rather if all of the experiences combine to make the trip out to west 
mifflin, kentucky, akron, etc worth it.  Take Phanny dance for example. 
The laser didn't work (don't have to remind anyone what a bummer that 
was) but the party went on strong without it. This lends me to believe 
that it's quite possible to have a good time at a 
somewhat-less-than-decent party regardless of what a let-down things 
become...

Raves are only big business if you make them that way. You don't *need*
huge ass dj's huge ass sound and huge ass lights to make a party go
off..and the less you spend, the less people you have to worry about
showing up to break even. Sure, if you throw a huge party you're either
going to need a huge turnout, or a huge ticket price, or a combination of
both..but If you throw a smaller party, without a bunch of lights, and
without a bunch of big dj's, you could lower your price, and not worry so
much about needing a ton of people to show up.

Right on!  The energy was totally wicked!  I was surprized at how many
people were really getting into the jungle, even the darkstyle.  Much
respect to sphinx - you got the crowd goin right well, and of course
dieselboys usual wicked selection, and 100% to all the kids going crazy
dancin' and blowin the whistles!  highlight of the night for me (though
not surprizing with my tastes)  :)

Big name DJs and big bucks do not a rave make.  Kibo beats a rave make.  
The rest is minutiae, IMHO.

Granted.  Promoting, by definition, is a means of making money.

I don't know.  Whenever I see a big flyer with a $20-30 price tag on it, 
I think "I'm lucky if I make that much between paychecks."  And this is 
not a flame, but what does big print on a flyer have to do with

bucks effect'?

>much about needing a ton of people to show up.

ok i understand your point and it is valid and i agree.

i think i have been understood; i am not a supporter of big raves, and when
i talk about lights and sound and dj's i dont mean "THE BiGGEST OF THE BIG"
but i mean not like, your stereo from home and such. When i mentioned these
things, i mentioned them in reference to my original point, which was
"throwing a rave isn't just throwing some shit together, it's a business
venture, no matter how big or small".

small parties are great, but they still cost money, and throwing a party
that costs 1,000.00 or throwing a party that costs 100,000.00 is still
stress, because i dont think anyone wants to lost 1,000.00 just like that.

my point in adding to this string was just that people underestimate the
role of the promoter, and that there is more involved than just renting a
space. other than that i am in agreement to most of what you say.

Cool, I understand.  I think our difference of opinions may come from
backgrounds..The first parties I went to *were* just "some shit thrown
together", and they were some of the best times I've had.  Times are
different now though, so obviously parties are going to be different. I
guess I just wish more people would do the DIY thang, but even that still
costs, otherwise I'd be doin it! :)

cool yeh. (: i think it does have to do alot with the fact that we are from
different cities.. because in toronto things are really different from
anywhere else i think.. the scene is really big and there's A LOT of
politics involved in each and every event, so i guess in a way my way of
thinking in terms of a party is "hardened" from, say, yours for example. 

but it's all good in the hood (:

i was wondering just the same thing about the badges this weekend at  
get down.  my love goes out to the sunshine kids for making it all  
happen, it was a kick-ass party, real good vibe.  dieselboy was  
great.  we made it there relatively early, around 11 w/ no problems.   
i wonder why the infoline didn't give the edgewood/swissvale exit -  
much closer.  anyhow, once we were nearby, the 7 other people in my  
car (a little chevy celebrity - tight squeeze) did the inevitable  
"hey we're by kennywood."  anyhow, besides the fact that the place  
was roasting, it was really great.  the cops didn't bother anyone  
that i talked to, and the everyone with the whistles got into it.   
there was no delay between sets, which was nice cause it didnt break  
the mood, and i was surprised at how many people got into the jungle  
groov.  great party.

hey ,

	thanks a lot for coming out for get down. i'm really glad that you
had a good time. the vibe was great thanks to people like you. keep coming
back, we appreciate everyone's feedback also. ... and a side note,
sunshine kids have never had a party that cost more than $18 and there was
only one that was that much. however, depending on the space (size and
location and owner) $25 can be perfectly logical. also think about how aat
one party there are 900 people and the next month there are only 400.
people are picky, if you charge more money, the less people you will need
to break even which helps out for the next party...

Naeema,

I would argue that the promoter's importance is equal to that of all the
dj's combined.  Without the promoter to assume the risk and organize the
talent and promote the show (a never ending task), there would be no fun.
Yet strangely, promoters rarely get anything but grief.  I believe the
promoters should have their names on all flyers -- they are stars too.
The promoter takes on the same role as the producer of a film.  We need a
Saul Zantz for raves, perhaps.

if you dont like the fact that we live in a capitalist society where one
needs money to do most things, then maybe you shouldn't be adhering to a
system that you aren't in favour of. 

and if you are going to take everything i say out of context then maybe you
shouldnt be posting to me.

hello :)

my name's paul, i'm an electronic and computer music major at the Oberlin
Conservatory of Music in ohio, and for those who may be interested, i have
decided to sell tapes and cd's of my work here this year. all tracks are
written, produced, and engineered by me here at the Oberlin studios (Buchla
Series 200 Modular in effect bay-bee) and the pricing is going to be $7 per
tape and $12 per cd (plus shipping) - both are 60 minutes long. i have not
yet decided which tracks will make up the release, and this is therefore
more of an information gathering post, but my styles range from harsh
electronics to 80's influenced ambient to hip-hop influenced jungle to
banging techno. i am curious about people's responses so feel free to email
me back if you have thoughts. and if you need a second opinion on track
quality, just ask k8 ;)

oh also, back home (st.louis) joeseph beuckman and i produce tracks as Ozone
Troop and we still have some tapes left of our first release ("Ozone Trip").
tapes are 60 minutes long and feature a more acid-housey style with lots of
slavic folk singing. those tapes are $6 and you can check our website
http://www.oberlin.edu/~pdavis/ozone for all the info and samples you could
want. thanks :)

paul

well.. it sounds like a lot of fun -- but someone decided to make it 17+!
what kinda bullshit is that? i know about 6+ people who would like to go,
but can't because of the age thing -- it's a loss for both us (we don't
get to go) and the promoter (who doesn't get our $$).

What's the story with 420? They sure are hyping it. I heard last year's
was really good. but I don't want to drive all the way out there (14
hours) for a bunk event. 

Does anyone have info, thots on, etc.? Also, have they announced any
more DJs than on the pre-flyer? I heard they are bringing in some
kickass DJs from Europe??? 

Keepin' the vibe alive,

well i have been reading this thread with great interest, and in fact i'm
a little surprised that most of you have clocked in with opinions that
mirror mine more closely than not.  then again, perhaps i should not take
this as a personal victory.  should i be surprised that people would feel
uncomfortable with the rising price of raves these days?  i don't suppose
it's a popular viewpoint to defend $20 and $30 events (except steve cinch,
hi steve!! :). 

and as much as i would like to jump in to this discussion wholeheartedly,
with the idea of debunking both the myths that "bigger = better" AND that
"DIY = better" (yes they're both problematic), i just don't have the time
to get embroiled.  the best way to go, it is often said, is somewhere in
the middle.  this would take a lot of explaining on my part, but i am
currently too busy planning friday's event here in columbus. 

i should mention that NITROGEN is only $5 before 12 midnight or $7 after,
located in a never-before-used warehouse space, with working bathroom
(always a plus).  very low-key vibe, very experimental and fun lineup,
blah blah blah etc etc.  there's my plug.

one more thing before i go:

well naeema you certainly have made your presence on this list very known. 
offhand i'd say that you simply cannot compare what you have learned in
toronto as being anything less than exceptional.  toronto is the
undisputed capital of electronic music in north america (only new york and
san fran could possibly come close), in terms of culture if not production
(that distinction goes to new york, chicago, and detroit of course). 

so that is where you have made your first miscalculation.  our area is one
in which events are promoted one person at a time, and with endless
perserverance, because we simply do not have the infrastructure to
distribute information as easily as you do in toronto.  nor do we have
easy access to the multitudes of listeners/appreciators that TO promoters
can access.  the total ohio and w. pa scenes probably account for about
4,000 ravers TOPS--and that's all of ohio and w. pa combined, mind
you...14 million inhabitants...meanwhile your TO parties regularly have
3,000-4,000 at ONE PARTY.  if you lived in this area you might understand
this in a different light.

your second miscalculation is in giving yourself such a privileged
perspective on this list, one which you yourself admit is not where your
reside.  this list is not about you as your comment above might imply.

and finally, we spell it "favOr" not "favoUr" (sorry, cheap shot ;)

see y'all friday if you come

        i have very good news to all fellow netminders in the scene:)
Through many trials tribulations and doubts among the scenesters here at
state college who have been whole-heartedly dedicating themselves to the
growth of a scene in central pa, i have single-handedly joined forces with
student groups and activity funders on campus with my rhetorical skillz to
bring you a *FREE* party out in the open. The SOBC (dont ask me what that
stands for) is giving me a check for $1980.00 to give this to yinz, and i
hope a lot of pittsburghers and perhaps ohio jungle peeps can make it.
(dont u guyz think horizon is a little bit pricy btw?)
        i believe at any cost this will demonstrate to the elitist and
purists that when approached with the right universal attitude, anything is
possible, including getting money from your education system to have a
kickass time at college!!! this attitude is about
FUN...FUNFUNFUNFUNFUNFUNFUNFUNFUNFUN...:)
        This party is first and foremost *NOT* a "rave," but i believe the
environment that will be produced will be very raver-friendly, at least for
the non-exclusive kidz. all interested will participate, and all jealous
will laugh, cuz penn state hasn't had much luck with openess of our
scene..it seems like we keep pushing it farther and farther underground,
misunderstood, and quite honestly, pretty lame.
        Now i can finally and _safely_ start comfirming dj's for 8 hours of
Jungle Muzik...woohoo!! im eager to finally make flyers and start smiling
when i promote cuz this ones from the heart:)

Doable, but I'm more preferential to the 'hole up in a warehouse lab'

    In January The Weird Love Makers awoke from a 30-month slumber and
unleashed a ridiculous barrage of Weird Love upon the land. What the hell
is this stuff? Space Age Bachelor Perversions? Lounge Porno? The Weird
Love Makers swing like only an unclothed flesh bulb can. Hoppin',
danceable lounge beats with a found sounds a-plenty from the undercurrent
of today's mostly-legal sex industry.

    Don't miss this cavalcade of Columbus tape geeks -- Mark G. of The
ECC/Gaga, Greg Fernandez of Good Cue Sign, and Jeff Central. A piddly
five bucks also gets you in to see the noisy experimentation of SP1N3 and
the electronic beats of Myungho Choi and The Sleep Engineer (Powerhouse)
along with full admission to the Nitrogen rave event going all night
long.


We'll see you there, because we know that
you're one of those extra-special ultra-elite in-types
that come to these things...

	WHAT: The Weird Love Makers, three other bands, and a whole rave

	WHEN: Friday, March 28th, 9:30pm (T.W.L.M. is 2nd & starts at 10:30pm)

	WHERE: The old Rice Paddy space, 682 Pearl Alley

			(Short North, near Lincoln)

	HOW MUCH: Only five bucks for everything! ($7 for lateniks, after 12)


	CALL: 470-0929 for more details.



    Okay, we know you're all waiting for the next GAGA show... hold on to
your tribal shorts; we're working on it...

Help! I desperately need someone to accompany me to Baltimore tomorrow
night!  I really want to go to Interphase, at Johns Hopkins.  At $2 this
party is a STEAL! The JHU crew rules the world, and tomorrow promises to
be a bangin party.  So, does anybody want to come with me?  All you have
to do is sit next to me in my car on the way down.  I'm leaving tomorrow
at around 6:30 pm, from Greensburg, PA (45 min. east of Pittsburgh).  If
you want to go and live in Pittsburgh I'll come pick you up :) Also,
anybody who lives on the way to Baltimore (ie central PA) that wants to
go, let me know I might be able to come pick you up too.   Let me know
ASAP if you want to go.

Call me tomorrow morning at 836-1167 after 8 am and before 12:30 pm.
or email me here :)
or call me tomorrow between 1pm and 6pm at 836-5820.

Hope somebody wants to go.  :)

one last plug: if you like live electronic music, experimental music in
general, or the old-school warehouse flavor, this is the event for you.
it's going to be small, but good.  $5 before midnight, $7 after, so
there's not much to lose. 

directions:

from the N take 71 S to downtown columbus, look for 670, go W. 

from the S take 71 N past downtown columbus, take 670 W.

from the E or W take 70 to 71 N, pass downtown, find 670 W.

once on 670 W take till it ends.  go R at the light and go N on NEIL AVE 
for 2 blocks, to BUTTLES.  go R on buttles and go another 2 blocks to 
HIGH ST, go R on high.  once on high immediately look for BRICKEL on the 
L, go L on brickel and at the first stop sign you will see the space in 
front of you.  look for the small motorcycle painting on the upper part 
of the building, address is 682 N. PEARL ALLEY.

space information:

this is not the cleanest space in the world, it was used as a motorcycle
parts shop and there are still some random parts and junk remaining. 
however, it is far more tolerable (less dusty and better-ventilated) than
the notorious warehouse space in dayton and in fact i think it is quite
appropriate for the music for this event. 

a potential problem might be bathrooms, there is only one and it is not
functioning at the moment (it was supposed to be turned on but hasn't
been).  one option would be a couple port-a-poddys but i know nobody likes
them so they're probably not worth it.  we'll probably just use the
current facilities and do the old hand-flushing method.  sorry for the
inconvenience but for a $5 event and an old-school warehouse type of feel,
some of the luxuries must be sacrificed...(yeah yeah, excuses excuses). 

temperatures for friday night will stay warm, but make sure to bring some 
kind of jacket as there is no actual heat in the space (probably won't be 
needed, but still).

parking: 

feel free to park in the street or in the many lots around the short north
area.  it is my understanding that cars are not towed from private lots at
night, and besides they're all mostly empty.  but just to be on the safe
side, try to park on the street even if it's a couple blocks away. 

again, admission is $5 before midnight, $7 after (this is to encourage you
to catch the earlier live performances)

schedule:

spine 			 9.30 - 11.00 
weird love makers	11.00 - 12.00
myungho choi		12.00 -  1.00
sleep engineer		 1.00 -  2.00
adam marshall		 2.00 -  3.00
andromeda		 3.00 -  3.50
tim madonna		 3.50 -  4.40
elias			 4.40 -  5.30
livid			 5.30 -  till no one's left (?)

i think that's it...hope to see you all there, and if not, well make sure
to get yo' ass to INDIGO next friday to see titonton's performance with 
live strings and voice (in case you missed it last november). 

and a good friday to all you christians out there.

hello all!

just writing to let you know that episode number 4 of my bi-weekly
mixshow "the darkside" is out now and ready for download on
http://816.com -- just click on the i-radio icon at the top of your
browser and select episode #4, "bassbin rockers", from the list.

this week's mixshow is a selection of breakbeat, clubby, and progressive
house tunes, a tad different from my usual style, but it's still pretty
interesting.  it's a mix of the latest wax, a couple underground white
labels, some new remixes of familiar favorites, and a classic choon or
two.  it features tracks by artists such as the bassbin twins, the
beloved, shi-take, electroliners, and armand van helden.

episodes #1-3 are still available as well, with mixes of hard house,
techno, and acid.  

as always, comments, suggestions, and requests are welcomed at
purectrl@ptd.net and 816@816.com.  thanks for your support and hope to
catch you listening!

peace,

ENERGIZER BUNNY OBITUARY

It is with great remorse that I inform you all of the sad news of
something that has happened to someone very dear to us all. 

Last night, at approximately 9:00 pm, the Energizer Bunny, after going,
and going, and going for so long, unfortunately passed away. 

Upon completion of the autopsy early this morning, the chief medical
examiner reported the cause of death as acute cardiac arrest induced by
sexual over-stimulation.. 

Apparently, someone had put Mr. Bunny's batteries in backwards and he
kept coming, and coming, and coming.....

I agree that most parties should be under $20, but the ocasional large
scale event can be worth $25 - $30 ! If parties cost that much each week, I
can see that hurting the scene, and with out the "Roots" parties for $5 -
$10 dollars our scene would become stagnant. But if every two to three
months a giant scale party takes place (Our 420 party for example) I think
it it only strenghtens our culture. When outsiders with an interest in the
scene  see the large flyers and the huge productions of some of the big
parties, I think it atracts them, and then enables to get the true "Bug"
about our scene. Then after they get the bug , these people become more
open to the "roots" parties. I love throwing smaller events, In fact I
prefer it, but the ocasional bash is always a thrill.
        And to answer the huge flyer cost thing, that's not the reason 420
is $30, the high price is do to the huge space needed to comfortably
accomadate 5000- 8000 people, the permits/security/door people/taxes , the
incredible pa's & dj's we have and also the incredible sound lights and
lasers that we are providing. So please don't get down on the high prices
of some parties. Use your judgement, and if you trust a promoters skillz,
then attend the show.

keep em small, keep em big both are cool, as long as at what ever price
your getting your moneys worth!!!!

Peace & respects,
Sleepy C

Hi! I'm new to the list. I used to live in Cleveland and like to keep up
on the scene there so I can jump back in when I'm home for a visit. 

This is a subject me and my friends talk about a lot (we live in
Nebraska & Kansas and Missouri). We've lived through Ravestock '94 (I
think), which was $45 for supposedly 3 days, and probably only half the
promised shit showed up. (Since then I've been to parties like ISO for
$5-10 for 3 days of truly incredible, continuous music and great vibes.
That really puts it in perspective.) 

Also, several times out-of-town promoters have come here, charged $12-15
(or tryed to) and provided weak DJs (their friends?), weak sound and
(you guessed it) weak vibes. Kids are reluctant to cough up the $$$ for
a party when they can go to after-hours at a club for less. They don't
care about the difference in music -- yet.

Dude, these flyers are a big part of our culture.  I don't know how many
ppl I know with whole walls dedicated to flyers. They invoke memories of
the good parties and bring your eyes alive with all their colorful
images. Also, flyers are a way to tell the small, low-budget parties
from the big ones (not always, but a photo-copied flyer is a pretty good
indicator that there won't be 8 blocks of sound). :)

Yeah, I don't know how the kidz in Chicago (for one) keep up!! A grrl
could go broke there if you only go to the "big" parties. Fortunately,
you can't keep the little underground parties and promoters down even
there though.

Maybe it's Attention Deficit Disorder, maybe I'm just spoiled, but for
me, there's nothing (much ;) like the high of being at a large-scale
event, grooving with the vibe generated by a huge room FULL of people,
your heart beating to the rhythm of booming pulses from some massive
f*king sound system, and matching steps with kids who dance so good you
can't believe your eyes . . . sigh.  May I always be able to find the
$$$ to afford it . . .

A _good_ smaller, local party can be the shit too, if there's a place to
dance, it's not _too_ hot, and if people keep PLUR in mind. It's great
for people to have a place to play/listen to more experimental stuff, or
less popular stuff (ambient, jungle, gabber, etc.) Sometimes, you luck
out and hear some DJ bust OUT! before he/she goes on to play big parties
all over the country and get paid actual $$ to do it. That's a thrill!

Yes! Out-of-towners at a party always enhance the vibe, too. Even
medium-sized parties can and should try to attract kids from other
cities. I've seen a single vanload of out-of-towners (who are frequently
more "experienced" at what constitutes the "real" spirit of raving)
single-handedly turn a mediocre party into a jammin' bash. 


>Use your judgement, and if you trust a promoters skillz,

'Nuff said. This list is a good place to hear who's throwing good ones
and who's not.

Yeah, $20-25 you oughta get great sound and lights, some bomb DJs and
either a really cool space or at least, guaranteed bust-free. Major
props to those who can do it for less! I tend not to support promoters
that seem to be in it only for the $$$, and you can usually tell. 

See you on the dance floor . . .

Not that it really matters, but just to clear this up and make it 
correct, I DJ on WPTS-FM, as I have for the past 6 years.  I know that I 
always get listed as a WRCT DJ, (well, I do guest spots on WRCT now and 
then, so this is sorta correct), my weekly radio show is:

The First Class Sound
WPTS-FM 92.1 University of Pittsburgh Radio
Sundays 6-8pm
Dancehall Reggae and Jungle

That said, "Hope to see y'alls there, no matter what radio station you 
think I should be on :-)"...

well so far we have 28,000$ for djs.  i'm sure the flyers are another few
thousand.  i saw the flyers.  i see you did save a few bucks by not having
them die-cut this year.

<bitch mode>
speaking of lights and trusting your promoters (and to some extent the lite
guys).... last years 420 said something about 8 godlights and 150
dataflashes.  i dont recall seeing either.  centrak was there with their
laser, but i've seen centrak a gazillion times.  last night was the first
time in along time i've seen those guys with new patterns.  anyhow, how
many times have you seen flyers that promised and never delivered?  never
once have i been given those free cds/tapes/magazines that are shown on
flyers.  ups in akron advertised free records or something like that.  the
guy helping at the door was given a bag of crap (spelled with a capitol
CRAP) records and told to give those out if anyone asked.  geez.  another
bitch is what are all the record labels supposed to mean on a flyer?  never
understood that.  

>keep em small, keep em big both are cool, as long as at what ever price
>your getting your moneys worth!!!!
ahhhh, we were talking about this one saturday.  i figured that if i go to
a party and spend 10 hours there.  i can only see so many djs.  if there
are 3 rooms, i can only be in one at a time.  i like having an option to
wander and check different stuff out, but at a point it gets
ridiculous-especially when the ticket price creeps up there.  i have
noticed that kids in the "bigger" cities seem to have lots more money to
drop on parties and drugs and what not.  i just cant do that.  my
priorities are elsewhere.  but as long as ppl keep going and there is a
demand for overpriced, way to much to take in parties, promoters have no
reason _not_ to throw them.  anyhow i digress....

well, glad to know i've helped pay for everyones wallpaper.  i keep most
flyers i get, but more and more i just dont even bother picking them up
anymore, mostly know about them via email.

well i should make super-shiny-extra-glossy-die-cut-3_foot-4_color_process
flyers for my 5 dollar party and change the price to 25$ and chalk it up to
promotion tactics.  yeah, then i can have all my drug dealer friends stand
by the door and sell their wares and call it a _REAL_ party!  then i can be
living the amerikan dream.

	Hello teenage America and geriatric ravers.

	As the days and minutes count down to lovemaking in Erie, PA, we
must say the response has been overwhelming. For those of you who came
out to join the Search for Mr. Yumma and thought the space was too
small, we would like to tell you that the location for Platonic Love is
nearly larger than life.

	We have also secured a space for before and after the main event

party-goers will get a kick out of this delightful weekend in Erie, PA
beginning April 11.

Hi everyone,

Please be advised that the security at The Edge is going to be very
strict this Saturday for REUNION.  We want to keep the line moving as
fast as possible, so please leave your bags at home or in the car to
ensure quicker entry for everyone.  Due to local crack down on
nightclubs we want to make sure that the party goes from beginning to
end.  And we want to leave no reason for the local authorities to shut
us down.  Please be intelligent about your actions at this event.  Two
of DCs strongest promotional crews have come together to bring you this
event so try to work WITH us during this rough time.

See you all there.

Peace.
