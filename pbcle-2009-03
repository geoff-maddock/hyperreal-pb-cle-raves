Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Growing up on hip hop as a teen, Teknobaby collected records such as the 
Sugar Hill Gang, Fat Boys, Run DMC, and the Beastie Boys. Attending teen 
clubs every weekend, Teknobaby teamed up with a breakin' crew and 
performed at several clubs around the city. Teknobaby's favorite artists 
were Slick Rick and Doug E Fresh, later followed by electronic artists 
such as DEE-Lite, Technotronic, Snap, and many others.

Teknobaby's love of electronic music began in 1989 when he discovered 
CD's such as Rave Til Dawn and 140 BPM. In 1992, Teknobaby purchased his 
first house record by Lil Louis' called French Kiss. A few months later, 
Teknobaby attending his first rave and fell in love with the music and a 
new form of dance. Teknobaby spent a few years traveling the U.S., 
dancing til the sun came up, while studying all variations of house, 
techno, jungle, and trance in the underground scene.

In 1994, after producing several underground events and trying his hand 
on the 1200's, Teknobaby traveled to the Underground Record Store in 
Orlando and began ordering records from Chris Fortier, DJ Icey and 
Kimball Collins. From there, Teknobaby also began a collection of acid 
tracks, ordering from DJ Sneak at Gramophone Records in Chicago. This 
included hits like Robert Armani's "Circus Bells", a few by Hyperactive, 
and many others.

>From 1995 to 1996, Teknobaby began touring as a DJ, spinning at 
underground events, while holding a residency at Sparks, a local night 
club in Louisville, KY. In early 1996, Teknobaby's love for techno 
directed him to his friend Heather Heart at Sonic Groove Records in New 
York where he finally discovered his true style.

Through 1996 to 1999, Teknobaby toured across the South and Midwest, 
bringing the techno flavor to all who would endure it, while throwing 
some reputable underground events in several cities in the midwest.

DJ Teknobaby has released 6 tapes and 4 CD's. Some of Teknobaby's 
favorite artists and performers are Richie Hawtin, ESP Woody McBride, 
Oliver Ho, Dave Ralph, Thomas Krome, Joel Mull, Laurent Garnier, Jeff 
Mills, Donald Glaude, and Heather Heart.

>From touring the country checking out new DJ's, producing underground 
events, and turning it out on the tables, Teknobaby packs old school 
feelings and true raver examples.

<strong>What is a RAVE?</strong> A rave party is a term that describes an all night dance party with fast-paced electronic music and light shows. At these parties you can expect to see DJ.s, live performers, and other acts playing all forms of electronic music including hip hop, trance, house, techno, and drum and bass with the accompaniment of laser light shows, projected images, and lots of fog.

In the early 1990.s, ravers often followed simple principles such as peace, love, unity, and respect otherwise known as PLUR. There was once a time when you could attend a party and everyone was thought of as a friend. A rave party was a way to escape from the problems of everyday life and join other people with similar interests in music, dance, art, and camaraderie. PLUR may be interpreted as the way that a raver believes he or she should live his or her life, and how people are expected to behave at a rave.


<strong>  The definition describing PLUR is:</strong>

<strong>P</strong>eace - Hostility typically serves no purpose other than to defend an ego that is lacking inner peace. To make peace with all people around you.

<strong>L</strong>ove - Acts and feelings of goodwill towards all others are a moral imperative with their own rewards. To stay close to all people and care for them unconditionally.    

<strong>U</strong>nity - This can mean either that: We are all united in the human condition, or as social beings, the feeling of connectedness with others is the ultimate end to our efforts. To stand together for the universal cause of peace and love

<strong>R</strong>espect - A person must show regard for the feelings of others through their actions and inaction. And one must have respect for oneself. To understand the diversities of culture.

While raves are nothing new to us, our goal is to bring back what we lost, create something new, and keep it exciting.
  We invite you to <strong>UNITE</strong> with us; bring your dancing shoes, a toy or piece of candy to give to someone, a smiling face, a glow stick or two, and LIVE for one night you will never forget!

<strong>LOWdown . Pittsburgh / NYC
                
- Featuring Tirade and C-Doc The WarHammer of SLAMjams</strong>

SLAMjamz is owned and run by Chuck D of Public Enemy.
  
Entering the game in 1994 with a mutual love and respect for Hip Hop; Tirade and C-Doc became LOWdown, taking a cue from classic Tribe (The Low End Theory) and The Beatnuts (Street Level). Influenced by greats from Pete Rock and CL Smooth, Eric B &amp; Rakim, Cash Money and Marvelous, Rob Base and DJ EZ Rock, to Captain and Tenille, they immediately embarked on tracks for their debut: groundZERO, a bass-heavy, boom-bap romp with mind provoking lyrics and captivatingly tight beats that promise evolution in the Hip Hop sound.

Current projects have these two members of the World's First Virtual Rapp Squad (The Impossebulls) bringing the LOWdown funk as a side project to their otherHip Hop efforts into the new era of music.

Chris Lash is an experimental electronic musician who has been actively writing and performing various forms of music since 1994. His work ranges from dance music to new age. Those who know his music often describe it as unclassifiable. Known for his voluptuous bass lines and ethereal rhythms one never knows what to expect and is never disappointed by one of his performances. The only thing certain is that no matter what musical mask he dawns, being the main brain behind such acts as Omega Minus, Plorb@tron and Ki Ko Te, you are sure to be moved.

<strong>Terry Mullan</strong>, Chicago's turntablist extraordinaire, turns out dance floors week after week throughout the US and abroad. His credits include Coachella, Sullivan Room, Bugged Out, The End, Footwork, and Ruby Skye amongst raves as far off as Japan, Australia and Germany. He has developed a faithful following to those who know through his signature style of funky quirky jacking acid house combined with cutting and scratching making up an entirely new genre all his own.

The eighties posed as the formative years of Terry's career. Although his roots began in hip-hop, he found himself smack in the middle of the Chicago house explosion. House and Disco were styles of music that were entirely new to Terry, but the match was struck. Soon after gaining inspiration from Chicago air personalities like Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk, Fast Eddie, Armando, &amp; Mike &quot;Hitman&quot; Wilson via 102.7 WBMX, Terry made house his home. Next, when acid house hit the US, the link was completed; Terry found the sound he was looking for. It was that added flavor he was waiting for, something new, twisted and forward. Now all the elements were coming together. And with the addition of the Detroit sound, this was it, three different languages, disco, house and techno. They could all translate the same message together or apart from one another.With his fluent style, these languages reflect his DJ'ing as well as the tracks he's now composing, which is his way of furthering the evolution of dance music.

For the future, Terry is going beyond just knowing his machines. This sound is put to the test on his releases on Robsoul, Definitive, Control, Funk'd, Chicago Housing Commission, Aciiieeed, and on his own imprint, Catalyst recordings. Through his label he has released projects for the likes of DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley, Halo Varga, Mazi, Angel Alanis &amp; TJR, as well as for himself under the monikers, Acid OG's, Speakerphreaker, Tone Broke, and as Serotonin project on Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva's former imprint Definitive which featured Terry's track &quot;Sidewinder&quot; on the Chemical Brothers &quot;Brother's Gonna' Work It Out&quot; mix cd. Additionally, Terry gained notoriety for his records under the alias Speakerphreaker which includes the largely successful &quot;Products Of Our Environment&quot; EP on Catalyst which was featured on Pete Tong's essential selection on BBC radio 1 in the UK &amp; &quot;La Nina/Nickel Bag Da Funk&quot; EP on Smile which was licensed to several top DJ mix compilations. 

Terry's DJ'ing, label and tracks have earned him a reputation that extends worldwide. Never one to follow the masses, he borrowed from each genre to create what we all know to be Terry's sound, putting a bad ass twist on an otherwise conservative house scene.

You could describe her style as sexy and soulful. <strong>Lady Bandit</strong> always tried to maintain that feeling. &quot;It's feel good music! Music that makes you feel sexy and just...feel good!&quot; She spends most of her time playing breakbeats but house is her first love. She has been known to play Nu Skool, whether it be dirty, funky, tech-funk or progressive breaks. It really doesn't matter. Just as long as the basslines are deep yet dirty, while the beats are funky.

She also plays electro, progressive, and tribal house. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladybandit" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/ladybandit</a>

Sat Mar 21                    ALARM WILL SOUND                    Cleveland

This is absolutely not to be missed. Saw these performers in Rochester a 
few years ago and was blown away. Many of you may have heard their 
acoustic covers of Aphex Twin pieces.

http://www.clevelandart.org/events/AlarmWillSound.aspx
http://www.alarmwillsound.com

The Weathermen, Woodstock, Stonewall, Vietnam, Nixon: 1969 was a year in 
which it seemed that society itself could be overturned, and perhaps 
needed to be. And this revolutionary spirit infused the music of the 
time. While senior composers—Stravinsky, Copland, 
Shostakovich—undertook their final works, John Lennon used his 
Montreal bed-in to demand world peace, Jimi Hendrix destroyed a violin 
on the stage of Queen Elizabeth Hall, Steve Reich and Philip Glass 
seemed to reboot Western music at the Whitney Museum, Cornelius Cardew 
invited anyone to make music with his Scratch Orchestra, and Leonard 
Bernstein’s Mass seemed to bring the threat of violent revolution 
directly to God.

Alarm Will Sound’s 1969 is a music-theater event that tells the 
stories of these artists and their relation to the historical events of 
the time. With the contagious we-can-remake-the-world optimism of 1969 
now a distant memory, this production offers a relevant evening of 
entertainment from the group that Alex Ross of the New Yorker has called 
“incontestably a sensational force.” $34, CMA members $32.

Alarm Will Sound is a 20-member band committed to innovative 
performances and recordings of today's music. They have established a 
reputation for performing demanding music with energetic skill. ASCAP 
recognized their contributions to new music with a 2006 Concert Music 
Award for "the virtuosity, passion and commitment with which they 
perform and champion the repertory for the 21st century." Their 
performances have been described as "equal parts exuberance, 
nonchalance, and virtuosity" by the London Financial Times and as "a 
triumph of ensemble playing" by the San Francisco Chronicle. The New 
York Times says Alarm Will Sound is "the future of classical music" and 
"the very model of a modern music chamber band."

The versatility of Alarm Will Sound allows it to take on music from a 
wide variety of styles. Its repertoire ranges from European to American 
works, from the arch-modernist to the pop-influenced. The group fosters 
close relationships with contemporary composers and has commissioned and 
premiered pieces by Steve Reich, David Lang, Anthony Gatto, Cenk Ergün, 
Aaron Jay Kernis, Michael Gordon, Augusta Read Thomas, Stefan Freund, 
Wolfgang Rihm, Payton MacDonald, Gavin Chuck, and Dennis DeSantis.

Alarm Will Sound may be heard on four recordings. Their genre-bending, 
critically acclaimed Acoustica features live-performance arrangements of 
music by electronica guru Aphex Twin. This unique project taps the 
diverse talents within the group, from the many composers who made 
arrangements of the original tracks, to the experimental approaches 
developed by the performers. Reich at the Roxy, their latest release, is 
an award-winning, surround-sound DVD/CD recording of a live concert of 
music by Steve Reich performed in the famed New York nightclub.

Members of the ensemble began playing together while studying at the 
Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. With diverse experience 
in composition, improvisation, jazz and popular styles, early music, and 
world musics, they bring intelligence and a sense of adventure to all 
their performances.

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff

time psytrance.

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

<strong>What is a RAVE?</strong> A rave party is a term that describes an all night dance party with fast-paced electronic music and light shows. At these parties you can expect to see DJ.s, live performers, and other acts playing all forms of electronic music including hip hop, trance, house, techno, and drum and bass with the accompaniment of laser light shows, projected images, and lots of fog.

In the early 1990.s, ravers often followed simple principles such as peace, love, unity, and respect otherwise known as PLUR. There was once a time when you could attend a party and everyone was thought of as a friend. A rave party was a way to escape from the problems of everyday life and join other people with similar interests in music, dance, art, and camaraderie. PLUR may be interpreted as the way that a raver believes he or she should live his or her life, and how people are expected to behave at a rave.


<strong>  The definition describing PLUR is:</strong>

<strong>P</strong>eace - Hostility typically serves no purpose other than to defend an ego that is lacking inner peace. To make peace with all people around you.

<strong>L</strong>ove - Acts and feelings of goodwill towards all others are a moral imperative with their own rewards. To stay close to all people and care for them unconditionally.    

<strong>U</strong>nity - This can mean either that: We are all united in the human condition, or as social beings, the feeling of connectedness with others is the ultimate end to our efforts. To stand together for the universal cause of peace and love

<strong>R</strong>espect - A person must show regard for the feelings of others through their actions and inaction. And one must have respect for oneself. To understand the diversities of culture.

While raves are nothing new to us, our goal is to bring back what we lost, create something new, and keep it exciting.
  We invite you to <strong>UNITE</strong> with us; bring your dancing shoes, a toy or piece of candy to give to someone, a smiling face, a glow stick or two, and LIVE for one night you will never forget!

<strong>LOWdown . Pittsburgh / NYC
                
- Featuring Tirade and C-Doc The WarHammer of SLAMjams</strong>

SLAMjamz is owned and run by Chuck D of Public Enemy.
  
Entering the game in 1994 with a mutual love and respect for Hip Hop; Tirade and C-Doc became LOWdown, taking a cue from classic Tribe (The Low End Theory) and The Beatnuts (Street Level). Influenced by greats from Pete Rock and CL Smooth, Eric B &amp; Rakim, Cash Money and Marvelous, Rob Base and DJ EZ Rock, to Captain and Tenille, they immediately embarked on tracks for their debut: groundZERO, a bass-heavy, boom-bap romp with mind provoking lyrics and captivatingly tight beats that promise evolution in the Hip Hop sound.

Current projects have these two members of the World's First Virtual Rapp Squad (The Impossebulls) bringing the LOWdown funk as a side project to their otherHip Hop efforts into the new era of music.

Chris Lash is an experimental electronic musician who has been actively writing and performing various forms of music since 1994. His work ranges from dance music to new age. Those who know his music often describe it as unclassifiable. Known for his voluptuous bass lines and ethereal rhythms one never knows what to expect and is never disappointed by one of his performances. The only thing certain is that no matter what musical mask he dawns, being the main brain behind such acts as Omega Minus, Plorb@tron and Ki Ko Te, you are sure to be moved.

<strong>Terry Mullan</strong>, Chicago's turntablist extraordinaire, turns out dance floors week after week throughout the US and abroad. His credits include Coachella, Sullivan Room, Bugged Out, The End, Footwork, and Ruby Skye amongst raves as far off as Japan, Australia and Germany. He has developed a faithful following to those who know through his signature style of funky quirky jacking acid house combined with cutting and scratching making up an entirely new genre all his own.

The eighties posed as the formative years of Terry's career. Although his roots began in hip-hop, he found himself smack in the middle of the Chicago house explosion. House and Disco were styles of music that were entirely new to Terry, but the match was struck. Soon after gaining inspiration from Chicago air personalities like Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk, Fast Eddie, Armando, &amp; Mike &quot;Hitman&quot; Wilson via 102.7 WBMX, Terry made house his home. Next, when acid house hit the US, the link was completed; Terry found the sound he was looking for. It was that added flavor he was waiting for, something new, twisted and forward. Now all the elements were coming together. And with the addition of the Detroit sound, this was it, three different languages, disco, house and techno. They could all translate the same message together or apart from one another.With his fluent style, these languages reflect his DJ'ing as well as the tracks he's now composing, which is his way of furthering the evolution of dance music.

For the future, Terry is going beyond just knowing his machines. This sound is put to the test on his releases on Robsoul, Definitive, Control, Funk'd, Chicago Housing Commission, Aciiieeed, and on his own imprint, Catalyst recordings. Through his label he has released projects for the likes of DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley, Halo Varga, Mazi, Angel Alanis &amp; TJR, as well as for himself under the monikers, Acid OG's, Speakerphreaker, Tone Broke, and as Serotonin project on Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva's former imprint Definitive which featured Terry's track &quot;Sidewinder&quot; on the Chemical Brothers &quot;Brother's Gonna' Work It Out&quot; mix cd. Additionally, Terry gained notoriety for his records under the alias Speakerphreaker which includes the largely successful &quot;Products Of Our Environment&quot; EP on Catalyst which was featured on Pete Tong's essential selection on BBC radio 1 in the UK &amp; &quot;La Nina/Nickel Bag Da Funk&quot; EP on Smile which was licensed to several top DJ mix compilations. 

Terry's DJ'ing, label and tracks have earned him a reputation that extends worldwide. Never one to follow the masses, he borrowed from each genre to create what we all know to be Terry's sound, putting a bad ass twist on an otherwise conservative house scene.

You could describe her style as sexy and soulful. <strong>Lady Bandit</strong> always tried to maintain that feeling. &quot;It's feel good music! Music that makes you feel sexy and just...feel good!&quot; She spends most of her time playing breakbeats but house is her first love. She has been known to play Nu Skool, whether it be dirty, funky, tech-funk or progressive breaks. It really doesn't matter. Just as long as the basslines are deep yet dirty, while the beats are funky.

She also plays electro, progressive, and tribal house. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladybandit" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/ladybandit</a>

Sat Mar 21                    ALARM WILL SOUND                    Cleveland

This is absolutely not to be missed. Saw these performers in Rochester a 
few years ago and was blown away. Many of you may have heard their 
acoustic covers of Aphex Twin pieces.

http://www.clevelandart.org/events/AlarmWillSound.aspx
http://www.alarmwillsound.com

The Weathermen, Woodstock, Stonewall, Vietnam, Nixon: 1969 was a year in 
which it seemed that society itself could be overturned, and perhaps 
needed to be. And this revolutionary spirit infused the music of the 
time. While senior composers—Stravinsky, Copland, 
Shostakovich—undertook their final works, John Lennon used his 
Montreal bed-in to demand world peace, Jimi Hendrix destroyed a violin 
on the stage of Queen Elizabeth Hall, Steve Reich and Philip Glass 
seemed to reboot Western music at the Whitney Museum, Cornelius Cardew 
invited anyone to make music with his Scratch Orchestra, and Leonard 
Bernstein’s Mass seemed to bring the threat of violent revolution 
directly to God.

Alarm Will Sound’s 1969 is a music-theater event that tells the 
stories of these artists and their relation to the historical events of 
the time. With the contagious we-can-remake-the-world optimism of 1969 
now a distant memory, this production offers a relevant evening of 
entertainment from the group that Alex Ross of the New Yorker has called 
“incontestably a sensational force.” $34, CMA members $32.

Alarm Will Sound is a 20-member band committed to innovative 
performances and recordings of today's music. They have established a 
reputation for performing demanding music with energetic skill. ASCAP 
recognized their contributions to new music with a 2006 Concert Music 
Award for "the virtuosity, passion and commitment with which they 
perform and champion the repertory for the 21st century." Their 
performances have been described as "equal parts exuberance, 
nonchalance, and virtuosity" by the London Financial Times and as "a 
triumph of ensemble playing" by the San Francisco Chronicle. The New 
York Times says Alarm Will Sound is "the future of classical music" and 
"the very model of a modern music chamber band."

The versatility of Alarm Will Sound allows it to take on music from a 
wide variety of styles. Its repertoire ranges from European to American 
works, from the arch-modernist to the pop-influenced. The group fosters 
close relationships with contemporary composers and has commissioned and 
premiered pieces by Steve Reich, David Lang, Anthony Gatto, Cenk Ergün, 
Aaron Jay Kernis, Michael Gordon, Augusta Read Thomas, Stefan Freund, 
Wolfgang Rihm, Payton MacDonald, Gavin Chuck, and Dennis DeSantis.

Alarm Will Sound may be heard on four recordings. Their genre-bending, 
critically acclaimed Acoustica features live-performance arrangements of 
music by electronica guru Aphex Twin. This unique project taps the 
diverse talents within the group, from the many composers who made 
arrangements of the original tracks, to the experimental approaches 
developed by the performers. Reich at the Roxy, their latest release, is 
an award-winning, surround-sound DVD/CD recording of a live concert of 
music by Steve Reich performed in the famed New York nightclub.

Members of the ensemble began playing together while studying at the 
Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. With diverse experience 
in composition, improvisation, jazz and popular styles, early music, and 
world musics, they bring intelligence and a sense of adventure to all 
their performances.

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.
www.myspace.com/kiriyamamusic

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

Hey...
 
Been a while since I''ve been out in cleveland,

Anyway, what's worth checkin out?  Anatomy 
looks decent, and a new place Barroom on Euclid?
 
Back in the day we'd do

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

SASCHA FUNKE [Bpitch Control - Berlin] + Doc Noe (Denver!)
Friday, March 20th @ Belvedere's

A kind of techno that sways between the polarity of emotional overload 
and concrete rationale . hence immediacy, which is what sascha funke is 
all about.

1989
sascha listens to a lot of euro-dance-pop as a twelve year-old his first 
purchased record after the fall of the wall was "technotronic mega mix".

1990-1992
first contact with techno and house is thanks to marusha's radio show 
"rave satellite;" sascha buys his first techno record "the seawolf" 
(underground resistance/ ur).

1993/94
he visits the legendary berlin club walfisch for the first time as a 
raver; he organizes parties in youth clubs in the east berlin section 
lichtenberg and thus encounters his first dj experiences with trance.

1995/96
sascha goes out with passion and visits clubs like the e-werk or the 
matrix.

1997
sascha begins his dj career in berlin clubs like discount or so36.

1998
he attempts first steps as a producer with borrowed equipment and the 
help of his soon to-be label partner paul kalkbrenner in their 
collective studio.

1999
sascha splits his studio and runs a new studio with djoker daan in the 
side rooms of the berlin club casino.

2000

further solo releases.

2002
bpitch control .gemeinsam-tour 2002., studio work on his first album.

2003
his debut-album "bravo" / BPC075 appears in september 2003. bravo-tour 
around the world.
participation with the soccer team of bpitch at the magnet mitte soccer 
cup - drop out at preliminary round,
best party: bpitch new year eve at maria/berlin

2004
participation with the soccer team of bpitch at the magnet mitte soccer 
cup - drop out at the semi finale, more remixes for a. kowalski and 
kompakt 100, best party: wmf summer camp and melt

2005
no participation at the magnet mitte soccer cup due to an injury, more 
remixes for ada and anja schneider, got over his fear of flying, started 
working for the wepshop of bpitch, best party: wmf summer camp and sonar

2006
moving back with his studio into the bpitch house, finished the second 
boogy bytes mix cd, iis currently working on his new album and is 
looking forward to the world soccer cup! moves temporarily to

Sat Mar 21                    ALARM WILL SOUND                    Cleveland

This is absolutely not to be missed. Saw these performers in Rochester a 
few years ago and was blown away. Many of you may have heard their 
acoustic covers of Aphex Twin pieces.

http://www.clevelandart.org/events/AlarmWillSound.aspx

The Weathermen, Woodstock, Stonewall, Vietnam, Nixon: 1969 was a year in 
which it seemed that society itself could be overturned, and perhaps 
needed to be. And this revolutionary spirit infused the music of the 
time. While senior composers—Stravinsky, Copland, 
Shostakovich—undertook their final works, John Lennon used his 
Montreal bed-in to demand world peace, Jimi Hendrix destroyed a violin 
on the stage of Queen Elizabeth Hall, Steve Reich and Philip Glass 
seemed to reboot Western music at the Whitney Museum, Cornelius Cardew 
invited anyone to make music with his Scratch Orchestra, and Leonard 
Bernstein’s Mass seemed to bring the threat of violent revolution 
directly to God.

Alarm Will Sound’s 1969 is a music-theater event that tells the 
stories of these artists and their relation to the historical events of 
the time. With the contagious we-can-remake-the-world optimism of 1969 
now a distant memory, this production offers a relevant evening of 
entertainment from the group that Alex Ross of the New Yorker has called 
“incontestably a sensational force.” $34, CMA members $32.

Alarm Will Sound is a 20-member band committed to innovative 
performances and recordings of today's music. They have established a 
reputation for performing demanding music with energetic skill. ASCAP 
recognized their contributions to new music with a 2006 Concert Music 
Award for "the virtuosity, passion and commitment with which they 
perform and champion the repertory for the 21st century." Their 
performances have been described as "equal parts exuberance, 
nonchalance, and virtuosity" by the London Financial Times and as "a 
triumph of ensemble playing" by the San Francisco Chronicle. The New 
York Times says Alarm Will Sound is "the future of classical music" and 
"the very model of a modern music chamber band."

The versatility of Alarm Will Sound allows it to take on music from a 
wide variety of styles. Its repertoire ranges from European to American 
works, from the arch-modernist to the pop-influenced. The group fosters 
close relationships with contemporary composers and has commissioned and 
premiered pieces by Steve Reich, David Lang, Anthony Gatto, Cenk Ergün, 
Aaron Jay Kernis, Michael Gordon, Augusta Read Thomas, Stefan Freund, 
Wolfgang Rihm, Payton MacDonald, Gavin Chuck, and Dennis DeSantis.

Alarm Will Sound may be heard on four recordings. Their genre-bending, 
critically acclaimed Acoustica features live-performance arrangements of 
music by electronica guru Aphex Twin. This unique project taps the 
diverse talents within the group, from the many composers who made 
arrangements of the original tracks, to the experimental approaches 
developed by the performers. Reich at the Roxy, their latest release, is 
an award-winning, surround-sound DVD/CD recording of a live concert of 
music by Steve Reich performed in the famed New York nightclub.

Members of the ensemble began playing together while studying at the 
Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. With diverse experience 
in composition, improvisation, jazz and popular styles, early music, and 
world musics, they bring intelligence and a sense of adventure to all 
their performances.

Mar 21-22                         EVOLUTION                            Ohio

EVOLUTION

Hey everybody,
All artists already been confirmed.
Kiriyama will be touring US and Mexico on confirmed dates in March 
21-22nd. It will be his rare apperance in States.
After having moved to the city of Oerebro, Alex discovered his 
predilection for synthesisers as a result of Weirdo Beardo having 
introduced him to the world of sequencers in the Little Blue Men studio. 
Years have passed and today Alex a k a Kiriyama is one of the 
co-founders of the Swedish power house Devils Mind Records and the 
studio group Checkpoint Music. He's frequently collaborating with French 
producer Hishiryo which has resulted in a number of co-produced tunes 
having been released, all of them comprising Japanese themes and East 
Asian influences.
Although it's common that people categorise Kiriyama as nocturnal music, 
Kiriyama's sound has a goaish slant today since goa trance was the music 
with which he fell in love during the mid 90s. With some ten tracks 
already out and more in the pipeline, he's currently working on his 
debut album which is planned for the first half of 2009. Moreover, he's 
currently compiling a CD of Scandinavian forest music for the Italian 
label Inpsyde Media.

Animaltek is still in Berlin,promoting their 12" release on Triebstoff 
(Germany).
www.animaltek.net

This event will be part of our vision to promote and share our muzik on 
our side of country.
Everybody welcome to attend,regardless of what kind muzik you into,we'll 
show our support to European scene and what we can do here.
It will be mixed styles ranging from minimal tek to hard hitting night 
time psytrance.

Sat May 09                      FOREVER YOUNG                       Toronto

The magic. The mystery. The music. There's nothing quite like raving. 
Every time you walk in the door, you're transported to a timeless land 
of peace, love, unity and respect; a place where the beat never stops 
and the wonders never cease; home away from home. You know how amazing 
it feels.

So do we.

We remember our first glimpse into the magical world that is raving. We 
remember the bracelets, the smiles, the hugs, the lasers, the music. And 
even though we've grown older, so long as we have raving in our lives, 
we never have to grow up.

On May 9th, join Nocturnal Commissions as we celebrate the wonder and 
magic of all things rave. Get out your brightest bracelets and your fun 
fur pants; bring along your old half-filled PLUR book; buy a new Vicks 
inhaler and a pair of glowsticks.

We are bright.

We are happy.

We are loving.

We are Toronto's Happy Hardcore ravers, and we are...

FOREVER YOUNG!

Subject: {pb-cle} New Library Tapes and Celer albums available / New Label

Experimedia is proud to announce the release and availability of two
fantastic new albums on dear friend Ian Hawgood's new label Home
Normal.

Home Normal will be kicking off with the ever wonderful Library Tapes
on March 20th. =91Sketches=92 was originally released in very limited
numbers by David Wenngren himself at Make Mine Music in 2007 as a
=91tour=92 CD. On =91Sketches=92 we hear David team up with cellist Danny
Norbury (Static Caravan, Ono), whose work we will also be releasing
later in the year under his and David=92s Le Lendemain guise.We decided
to repackage and re-release this beautiful work with Jeremy Bible
taking over photography, design and mastering duties."

Now available in the Experimedia shop are the first two releases on
this fantastic new label!

Library Tapes
Sketches
Direct whilst elusive, sumptuous and austere, precise yet
expansive.David Wenngren=92s Library Tapes is an amalgam of beautifully
juxtoposed expressions and deftly described phrases.Found sounds and
field recordings crackle and smoulder as Danny Norbury=92s cello teases
out a foundation for fragile piano melodies. While those passages so
gentle and elegant form the spine of David=92s sound, its the sense of
patience - of compositional balance which lifts his work to the
stratosphere. These are 11 windows to a world of timeless suspension,
of grace and of glorious decay.=92
http://www.experimedia.net/index.php?main_page=3Dproduct_music_info&cPath=
=3D8_47&products_id=3D181

Celer
Engaged Touches
The music of Will Thomas Long=92s and Danielle Baquet-Long=92s Celer is an
absorbing combination of classic ambient, minimalism, and =96 perhaps as
the most distinct characteristic =96 overwhelming romanticism. Longing,
melancholy, nostalgia, and the like seem to be recurring themes in
Will and Dani=92s works. Engaged Touches begins with hypnotic sounds of
a train clattering on its tracks. This departure seems to set the
whole piece into a context of travel and distance, moving away from
and towards something, someone. After a while these sounds give way to
a rousing, majestic set of string loops. Similar phases of different
field recordings and grandiose loops take turns throughout the whole
work. This brings about a dynamics of contrasts: the concrete and the
abstract, the particular and the general, the mundane and the exalted,
and so on. The phases of string loops take up most of the album and
evoke a yearning feeling of distance, grand and epic. The title,
Engaged Touches, however, refers to quite the opposite, the close and
intimate. It feels as if it is these kinds of touches that the string
loops wailingly, albeit very gracefully, long for. This is exactly the
kind of powerful romanticism that seems to define so much of Celer=92s
work. Because of the heavy presence of string loops Engaged Touches
reminds me of some of Celer=92s earlier works. I would call it a classic
Celer piece, if it weren=92t for the fact that their oeuvre spans only a
few years back, and it would be too early to ponder the distinct
phases and the internal relations in their output. Engaged Touches is
another beautiful addition to the rapidly growing body of work by
Celer =96 an oeuvre that I already consider one of the most important in
modern ambient music.

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Ed Rush background:

Born in west London, Ed Rush originally started out into Hip Hop and 
electro but eventually found the growing underground rave scene. 
Fascinated by the breaks in the hardcore sounds at the time, Ed Rush 
convinced his neighbor, Nico Sykes, to let him produce tracks with him.

Eventually they released .Bludclot Artattack. in 1993 - a journey into 
the darkcore sounds. While most releases at the time had a certain 
momentum and feel, the track was like no other, and marked the shift of 
hardcore.s split into drum and bass.

Ed Rush eventually released follow-ups nearly two years later, this time 
with DJ Trace, on .The Mutant. in 1995. .Guncheck. soon followed, 
another track developed in a recognizable Ed Rush style - gangsta 
attitude, and crunchy basslines.

Ed Rush soon found himself on the cusp of prominence, as his releases in 
1996 on the Techsteppin. compilation, the Skylab EP on the Metalheadz 
label, and .Killimanjaro. on the Prototype label all helped to define 
the genres. direction towards techstep, a two-step style of drum and 
bass. He subsequently released more tracks on various labels, and his 
popularity as an artist grew, as did his sound as a producer.

The greatest collaboration was ahead of him though, when he teamed up 
with Optical. They created their own label, Virus, and their first 
release was .Medicine/Punchbag,. Their eventual LP, Wormhole in 1998, 
was released to critical and underground success, and is regarded as a 
genre classic, as the sounds from that album again redefined the 
direction drum and bass was headed, and solidified their status as the 
forerunners of the new sound of drum and bass.

More recently, after a slew of other releases, Ed Rush and Optical have 
released another genre-defining LP, the Creeps. This was again met with 
critical and commercial success, as the album helped them to win 
Knowledge drum and bass award for producers of the year.

------TECHNO/HOUSE ROOM------

DJ PSYCHO - Detroit Techno Militia - Flint, MI

DJ Psycho (Dezi Magby) has been repping the streets for the last 25 
years of his life, dedicating himself to the art of not only rocking the 
crowd, but making a mix that is as complex as his interests. Mike Banks 
(UR) himself said, after seeing him for the first time, .Look at him! 
Just look at him! He truly doesn.t give a fuck! Records don.t make him. 
He makes THEM do what he wants them to do!. He.s been referenced as 
being .the split difference between The Wizard and The Tazmanian Devil.. 
His live mixes cross boundaries and genres effortlessly, and his mixes 
on CD go beyond simply beatmatching records . they tell stories.

THE LIBRARIAN & EVAN SCOTT - Race Car Productions - Cincinnati

As a team, Evan Scott & The Librarian combine to bring a wider 
repertoire and a heightened performance with both hearts poured into the 
sounds of techno with strong gothic undertones and minimal composition. 
What they have done for Race Car Productions is equal to the combined 
force they achieve live. Unpredictable and creative, while inventive and 
technical. http://www.myspace.com/racecarproductions

Sat May 09                      FOREVER YOUNG                       Toronto

The magic. The mystery. The music. There's nothing quite like raving. 
Every time you walk in the door, you're transported to a timeless land 
of peace, love, unity and respect; a place where the beat never stops 
and the wonders never cease; home away from home. You know how amazing 
it feels.

So do we.

We remember our first glimpse into the magical world that is raving. We 
remember the bracelets, the smiles, the hugs, the lasers, the music. And 
even though we've grown older, so long as we have raving in our lives, 
we never have to grow up.

On May 9th, join Nocturnal Commissions as we celebrate the wonder and 
magic of all things rave. Get out your brightest bracelets and your fun 
fur pants; bring along your old half-filled PLUR book; buy a new Vicks 
inhaler and a pair of glowsticks.

We are bright.

We are happy.

We are loving.

We are Toronto's Happy Hardcore ravers, and we are...

FOREVER YOUNG!

wow I know I couldnt stop going thru pics last night and feeling so so lucky that we got to have such good times.  I decided to just start putting photos up on myspace, seems the easiest... does anyone know if there is a limit,  I read the FAQ doesnt mention limits on amounts of photos or anything but I'm sure there must be.
