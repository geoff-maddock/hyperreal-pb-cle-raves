Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

We only went up to Detroit for one day but here's my little recap.  Headed up there early Saturday and got there just in time to catch Andy James on the Nefarious stage @ the festival.  Definitely a good way to begin.  He dropped some great techno tracks, managing to build up a mini-fan club of people in the process who came to check his playing out and couldn't help but dance. Headed over to the main stage then to hear Derek Plazlaiko (sp?)for what I think was over a 1 1/2 hour set. pretty cool glitchy tracks.  Wandered the city looking for dinner/drinks---neither of which really happened, and then hung with friend at scary little hotel bar at the Ramada before finally heading over to Yel 2 at about 11:00. 
 
 This party was jumping already at that time--thank God for presales. The space was perfect for the lineup.  Headed downstairs first where Matt Dear and Derek P. tagged back and forth having a blast.  Then they would just switch over to Matt Johnson on the other side of the room.  Great set-up and planning.  The music was thumping glitchy tech.  Great energy, fantastic mixes---crowd was incredibly cool.  
 
Friends insisted we had to go check out upstairs.  Walked into a full-blown rave with a packed audience.  Speedy J and Chris Leibing were going back and forth dropping some of the most high-energy techno I've ever heard. It created a fist-pumping crowd.  The sound was perfect---not ear-shattering, but you could feel it.  Lighting was cool.  
 
Bounced from the basement to the main floor throughout the night, without a single dissapointment.  Constent major quality as far as DJ's, tracks, crowd, presentation---the entire eve. Only complaint was that this was not a late-night party. 
 
The upstairs had some ambient stuff going on too, lots of pillows to sit on and candles and stuff---but really wasn't my thing with all the good stuff on the other two floors.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Detroit / Yel 2

Yah this show was fucking sick.  Speedy and Chris did a amazing job on their
set.  The EAW sound system was probably one of the best I have heard, ever.
Best show I saw all festival. (but I didn't/couldn't see it all).  IF that
show plus sound system were transported to the main stage we would of had
something very special happen ;p

> We only went up to Detroit for one day but here's my little recap.  Headed
up there early Saturday and got there just in time to catch Andy James on
the Nefarious stage @ the festival.  Definitely a good way to begin.  He
dropped some great techno tracks, managing to build up a mini-fan club of
people in the process who came to check his playing out and couldn't help
but dance. Headed over to the main stage then to hear Derek Plazlaiko
(sp?)for what I think was over a 1 1/2 hour set. pretty cool glitchy tracks.
Wandered the city looking for dinner/drinks---neither of which really
happened, and then hung with friend at scary little hotel bar at the Ramada
before finally heading over to Yel 2 at about 11:00.
>
>  This party was jumping already at that time--thank God for presales. The
space was perfect for the lineup.  Headed downstairs first where Matt Dear
and Derek P. tagged back and forth having a blast.  Then they would just
switch over to Matt Johnson on the other side of the room.  Great set-up and
planning.  The music was thumping glitchy tech.  Great energy, fantastic
mixes---crowd was incredibly cool.
>
> Friends insisted we had to go check out upstairs.  Walked into a
full-blown rave with a packed audience.  Speedy J and Chris Leibing were
going back and forth dropping some of the most high-energy techno I've ever
heard. It created a fist-pumping crowd.  The sound was perfect---not
ear-shattering, but you could feel it.  Lighting was cool.
>
> Bounced from the basement to the main floor throughout the night, without
a single dissapointment.  Constent major quality as far as DJ's, tracks,
crowd, presentation---the entire eve. Only complaint was that this was not a
late-night party.
>
> The upstairs had some ambient stuff going on too, lots of pillows to sit
on and candles and stuff---but really wasn't my thing with all the good
stuff on the other two floors.

i'm still recovering from the weekend so i'll keep it brief. thanks to jamie, valerie, damon, jenny, and brandt for coming out early to see me play on saturday! overall the lineup for the festival was pretty boring......joris voorn & derek plaslaiko were the only ones i enjoyed all weekend. the best music was coming from the nefarious tent & the smaller booths. i missed yel 2 due to fundage, but seeing ben sims tear shit up on 3 dex sunday night more than made up for it.
 
i need more sleep.........

hahaha...nice.

http://www.pbase.com/image/29653939

My review...I only got to see a little of the
festival...Andy rocked a nice set and Derek Plaslaiko
tore it up on the main stage.  The rest of the stuff I
heard at the festival doesn't bear noting.

Yel2, although we got there a little late, was the
bomb.  Perfect size venue (packed but not so crowded
that there wasn't room to dance), Incredibly well-done
sound, and great performances.  Matthew Jonson's set
rocked, particularly with some of the shuffle-beat
stuff he played and one track with a killer bass-synth
line that Plaslaiko had played earlier in the day at
the festival.  Plaslaiko and Matt Dear did a great job
opening and closing that room as well...amusing that
they started their second set with chutney though. 
The main floor was awesome the whole night as
well...leibing and speedy J make an awesome tag team
combo...great tracks and energy throughout the
evening...ending with acid techno at ~150 bpm...sick
shit.  Can't wait to see this again next year.

yeah, that game is annoying.  took me like 6-8 minutes to stop 
thinking, then it was easy.  anyone who wants to feel dumb after 
finding out how it works, let me know and i'll provide you with 
the answer.  thanks tom, you made my brain hurt for no reason at 
all.

Visit experimedia.net's download page @

BTW downloads of these new albums are conveniently
available for download in a single zip file which also
includes print quality images, playlist files, and
additional album information.

:two:

If your reading this far then you must be interested
and might want to consider joining the new experimedia
mailing list by filling out the minimal two field form
on experimedia.net's main page. Of course you can be
assured that we would never share your contacts with
anyone else and that you wont get an email from us
everyday. We guarantee that when we send out a news
bulletin email it will be full of interesting news,
new release information, exciting events, free stuff,
and good advice on new ways to get your music heard
and network with others in the independent music
community. Visit the link below to join the news list.
Also this way if you get these emails now and you
would rather not just don't sign up and eventually you
wont get them anymore.
http://www.experimedia.net/news.html

:three:

I just recently caught wind of a very cool new
independent electronic music magazine called bassline
magazine. Even cooler was that it was free. This
magazine featured great interviews, and event, gear,
music, artists, and film reviews. All with an
excellent focus and commitment to the independent
community in all aspects. Covering all styles of
electronic music and more. After picking up this
magazine I contacted them for advertising rates and
they are really good. I plan on putting in an ad
myself in an upcoming issue. I thought some of you
might find this useful to help with some promotions
for artists & labels. If you drop the name experimedia
or jbible they just might give you a 30% discount. No
promises though. So check it out and get in touch with
them if you are looking to advertise or just get your
hands on a good information.
http://www.basslinemagazine.com/

:four:

Some of you may have heard of or already be on one of
the friend/networking sites (ie: friendster, myspace,
etc) but myspace.com just got way cooler for those
working in the independent music community.
Myspace.com just added musicians profiles where, for
free, you can get a site where you can post music from
yourself or your label for people to listen to with
the built in media player. You can also choose to
allow people to download your tracks if it pleases
you. One of our artists Helen Keller has already
created an artists profile and Helen says even in a
short time it has been a great way to network with
other independent artists and labels. Helen has
already received a couple release offers and remix
projects through the myspace musicians profile. Check
out Helen's profile for an idea of what its all about
by clicking the first link, then click the second one
to get started on setting up your own and be sure to
invite Helen to be on of your friends if you do.
http://www.myspace.com/helenkeller
http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=bandjoin&Mytoken=20040531221949


:five:

Since my new webhost dreamhost.com offered a free
guestbook I thought I would go ahead and throw this on
the site. It has yet to be linked directly from the
site but please feel free to sign it if you have any
comments about the releases, the independant
community, or anything else you might have in mind.
http://books.dreambook.com/jbible/experimedia.html

:six:

We have finally decided that our links section at
experimedia.net is long overdue. So to get this
started and to keep it organized email the address
below with your links or preferrably small
image/banner link code. Please try to include a brief
description of what you or your organization are about
and why you think your link would fit in on 

experimedia.net's links section.
links@experimedia.net

:seven:

If you haven't seen it yet experimedia / spivak
records / and molotov records started its own forum /
message board. Check it out at the link below or visit
experimedia.net and click on the forum section.
http://spivakrecords.proboards23.com/

:eight:

Experimedia recently upgraded its server by switching
to a new webhost who are making it possible to add
tons of new features, downloads, and more to
experimedia.net for a really really good price. Tons
of space, bandwidth, pop3 email accounts, tons of
other great and unique features, and a great
management interface. I suggest dreamhost to anyone in
search of an excellent place to host your site with.
Be sure to list jbible as your reference.
http://www.dreamhost.com

:nine:

As always we at experimedia.net are always interested
in hearing new music and meeting new people passionate
about music. For complete instructions on how to get
your music into our hands for review for release,
promotion, and airplay on our fm radio station in NE
Ohio please email the address below with demo
submission in the subject line. We lookforward to
hearing from you.
experimedia@experimedia.net

:ten:

I recently came across these guys from akron running a
great website with lots of excellent music and
artists. Patternbased.com specializes in excellent
intelligent hip-hop and lush trip-hop. When I heard
these guys I was amazed that they weren't already
performing all over the world. They even offer beats
for emcees. These guys are totally cool 

merging organic and electronic production tools.
http://www.patternbased.com 



P.S. We at experimedia.net just want to thank everyone
who has supported us over the years. We wouldnt be
where we are 

at today without you. Keep supporting your independant
labels, artists, and record stores. DIY pride forever.

Sincerely,
Jeremy Bible

Well, i unfortunately did not get to leave to go to the festival until Saturday night because i worked all day, so i didn't get to catch Andys set. Steph and I  got to the festival around 10 or so and got to see Terrance Parker tear up the decks.
 Sunday was a very long and eventful day. Steph and i got press passes for the show and were able to get behind stage and get some great interviews. We got back stage during the official Movement press conference, and got some good question-answers from the big shots of Movement, Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May. After my press conference experience i got to catch Kage from Beretta music down by the water for a ten minute interview, which went very well. We also got an interview with Tourted Soul, who i had been waiting to see since they came to Cleveland. We some how managed to drag all three of them in the back corner were they were tearing stuff down and get a good 5-10 minute interview, they are all great guys. Andy and i left the party early when it started raining and headed back to the hotel to get ready for Substance, with Ben Sims. I seriously had know idea how insanely awesome Ben Sims really was, it was by far one of the best sets i have ever heard. He played a flawless 2
 in a half our set on three turn tables, something Ive never seen before.. After the after party Sherry, Jesse, Marissa, and Eric all came back to the hotel room with us and hung out till morning. 
By Monday, there wasn't much life left in me, so i enjoyed laying in the grassy knoll watching the boats go by, something i look forward to every year. Half way through Marques Wyatt set Steph and I headed home, i was more then ready by that point. 
 
Overall, i had a blast in Detroit, as i always do, the line up could of been a little better, but i still got to hear some good music, and kick it with some good people.. I am looking forward to next year for sure!

So what if he molests little boys, thriller is one of the greatest albums ever made. Same with lionel ritchie, he makes good music, the guy is a legend. Donna Summer??? She is the reason we have a lot of the music that we listen to today. Madonna and prince, they are far from being the worst. The backstreet boys???? Yeah they suck, bad.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Overview of Detroit!

I wish Movement was still going on!! It was great, I
look forward to it every year. This year it was extra
fun b/c Lindz and I got to mingle with the VIP
industry people (not to mention the free beer,
champaign and food!!) including another up-start
magazine staff member out of Toronto.

There's so much that goes on behind the scenes of the
festival that we found out, that it was definitely an
interesting experience. Like Lindz said, we got our
interviews we needed to get and still had fun in the
process (hah, i had a little TOO MUCH fun on Sunday
night, but i won't go into that on here!)

Our Associate Editor Rebecca (she's not a pb-cle
poster) also came up from Cincy and we gathered
advertising contacts ... (unfortunately she and I
missed the Mad Lib show!).

Seems like the weekend always goes way too fast but it
was great running into people that I haven't seen for
awhile! Matt B. and his crew from Cleveland, Webster
from Kent also saw Sherry, Trout, Valerie, Schmitty
and a couple other Pb-Clevers that I know I'm
forgetting.

Music was pretty dope, there was actually a lot of
house, but I also managed to find the drum 'n bass at
the Necto tent. My dude from DHD (Deep Heat Detroit)
was there too (dope deep house label from detroit)
which i was pleased to see b/c it's a booth i have to
visit every year! Oh yeah, I also saw some other scene
kids ... Shiva from Indy and some Cincy/Dayton peeps.

We'll have a review of Movement '04 in our next issue
of Bassline plus some other upcoming parties this
summer!

peace!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} world's worst record collection

you obviously werent there when (i think) titonton dropped (i think) 
billy jean to a healthy dance floor and totally killed it.... 
it was definately one of  the MJ songs from that era.  it was at the 
columbus armory.  i want to say it was that party thrown down there by 
happyhead from yompton....  sorry for not being really specific, but it 
was a long, hazy time ago.....  i do remember a MJ track killing 
things.  it wasn't a remix or reworking either. it was the original.

some quotes......

"you're as old as you want to be"

and

"i'm old enough to know better, young enough not to care"

and i'd say the way he killed the dance floor wasn't "off the hook" .... 
interesting maybe, but the people dancing sure didn't think so.   you 
saw what happened. people stood still staring around for a few solid 
minutes.

Well, then they're obviously idiots.  Billie Jean is a universally great
song.  Just because some people in Columbus are musically moronic isn't
M.J.'s fault.

Please.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} world's worst record collection

"What else do the top DJs do with their turn tables ?

Once you can match the tempo of two records by using the pitch adjustment
on your turntables you will need to learn how to play them together
smoothly.
This is what the DJ mixer is for."

http://www.dj-tips-and-tricks.com/advanced-mixing-with-turntables.html

i kind of miss bitching about titonton sets.  at least he makes good records
and is a kind human being with a sparkling personality (seriously).  i think
i know
exactly the party you're talking about too.  that's insane.  where's
ravedata.com.

side note: i'd say that playing a really really exceptional track, like bj,
at the really
really bad time is about the worst thing a dj can do.  kind of like eating
the icing
off the cake before the party starts, or farting in a quiet room full of
people, or
kissing someone who hates you.

i have to find my 'you better hit it' t-shirt.

You're also making me think of the time Titonton dropped "For the Longest
Time"

Still gives me a shiver.

Props and much love to two always, but especially great were the days gone
by. Copley Country Club owned!!

Thanks for showing me some things, friend. Some of the skills I have now
may be a little different than the people I work with, but knowledge like
that is priceless.

I'm a logical-mathematical thinker

-Like to understand patterns and relationships between objects or 
actions
-Try to understand the world in terms of causes and effects 
-Are good at thinking critically, and solving problems creatively

Careers which suit Logical-Mathematical thinkers include
Physicist, Chemist, Biologist, Lawyer, Computer programmer, Engineer, 
Inventor

woot computer programmer, which is what I want to do :)  This is also 
proof why spongebob squarepants makes absolutely no sense to me.  How

inhabit it
    * have an aptitude for communicating with animals
    * You try to understand patterns of life and natural forces

Like other Naturalist thinkers, Leonardo longed to spend time in the
countryside. He spent hours watching birds to understand how they flew.
Other Naturalist thinkers include Charles Darwin, Jane Goodall, Johnny
Morris, David Attenborough

Careers which suit Naturalist thinkers include Biologist, Meteorologist,
Forester, Farmer, Astronomer, Alternative therapist"

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: how to punish children

You're the type of person that keeps making it harder for parents 
to raise THEIR children.  Beating a kid's ass teaches them a 
lesson.  When they are doing things simply to spite you including 
drinking alcohol when they shouldnt be, they need to have some 
sort of discipline.  It's not a traumatic event to take away a 
kid's PS2.  Any 6'3, 13 year old should be out playing basketball 
anyways.  Sports help to keep kids out of trouble.  Things need to 
be done to teach kids how to respect people.  If you can't even 
respect your parents, how can you respect anyone else?

Childrens services is for shit like when you are starving your 
child as a punishment, or if you've got 150 cats in your house 
with no litter boxes.  Only for unhealthy environments, not for 
taking away the PS2.

like dave chapelle and the pee song, i was joking.

on a more serious note, i do think it's weak for parents to discipline their
kids in public -
'showing' them the right thing to do via humiliation.  this parent seems out
of control.

so you were the winner of the PS2 eh ?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: how to punish children

well...

1) they were dumb to start the bidding at $.01. if they wanted to recoup the costs, they could've
made a reserve.

2) not only are they out the money for the weekend's activities, but the cost of the playstation 2
itself. i guess they're willing to take that loss to teach a lesson.

3) despite the dumb financial handling of the deal, i think it was a great idea.

unless you're an ogre, a 30-to-40-something parent trying to whoop a 6'3" 13-year-old's ass may just
expose your physical weakness, and that could lead to more physical challenges from someone just
entering the hormone-enraged rebellion-bent teenage years(6'3" and THIRTEEN? got'DAMN!). just using
your brain and hitting them where it really hurts like this parent did is probably way more
effective in the long run. i'm all for a spaking when the situation calls for such, but i think this
scenario went beyond that point.

and ed, i think kelly was kidding about the "yutes services" thing....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: how to punish children

<<like dave chapelle and the pee song, i was joking.>>

"r. kelly's doo-doo butter." cracks me up even just thinking about it.

<<on a more serious note, i do think it's weak for parents to discipline their kids in public -
'showing' them the right thing to do via humiliation.  this parent seems out of control.>>

well, that depends, really.

(exaggeration for effect, of course...)

if the kid grows up and knocks over a liquor store, his picture, his address, heck even his middle
name will be on tv or at the very least, in the paper.

showing the consequences of theft in a relatively benign way like this does more good than an ass
whooping. there's no picture of the kid, no names, only people that know the family would have any
reasonable expectation of a personal effect on the kid in question here...and you know the dad is
gonna tell his friends about how his "pain in the ass kid drank half a bottle $120  of Dom and put
it back in the fridge" anyway...

kids gotta learn to drink the cheap stuff that parents will never miss....like i did....if these
little hellions START OUT drinking Dom, where will they stop? get that kid some fuckin' jaquins'
vodka or some VO whiskey and let him earn it.

Subject: {pb-cle} THREE (hallucination ltd) - June 25

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 3

THREE - Hallucination Limited, Shaboom (Second-Hand Satellites) 

Ask most of the big DJs who their favorite DJ is, and more often than not, the answer will be Tampa's legendary DJ Three. His word-of-mouth afterparty in the wee hours of the morning at this year's Winter Music Conference was packed with a who's who of the movers and shakers in the dance music world. 

Armed with a sound that borrows equally from vintage acid-house, soulful techno, and modern dub, Three has taken it one step further year after year from San Fran's legendary Wicked Crew party to NYC's Twilo to London's Fabric and back again. Echoing his wide tastes as a DJ, his production output (Second-Hand Satellites, Three A.M., Montage Men) has captured a not-so-common cross section of dance floors from house to techno, and all things in between. 

Last year, the Hallucination Limited label was launched to turn his genre-bending passion for good music into a platform for other like-minded artists. With the label off and running, he's vowed to spend more time this year where he's most at home -- behind the decks. Let's help make him at home!

now now, you shouldn't encourage such horrid, barbaric actions.  Just think 
about the children and how it affects them on a psycological level that is 
far greater than being punished for wrong doing.  you should sit down with 
your young adult and have a discussion on how that is not the proper thing to 
do....

Yes, I'm being sarchastic.  The people that think that should be tossed into 
the streets with the spammers and get stoned.  Freaking "think about the 
children" people.  I don't have children, why the hell should I think about 
them?  I'd take that broom and do more then just beat the kids ass with it...  
yeah, I don't plan on having kids for a long time, if ever :)

when i first saw that link the other day, i thought the parents 
were lying because of the details involving the dom. i dont care 
how stupid the 13 year old is, its damn near impossible to see 
ANYONE trying to open a bottle of real champagne with a corkscrew. 
those things have big knobs on the end of the cork so its easy to 
just pull out. i bet those low class motherfuckers never even had 
dom before.

I guess this went to the whole list. I'll reply list-wide, just in case
anyone else cares or whatever.

My destination is Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Its on the Atlantic coast,
in the northern part of the state. Its near St. Augustine and is about 1.5
hours north of Daytona Beach. Wonder if I can still pass for a college
student?!

i probably wouldnt be a heathan bastard if i was beaten in school...i 
mightve learned my lesson with a sore ass instead of writing on the 
chalkboard or not getting recess.


i guess me ending up as a janitor at the cleveland public schools is karma 
coming back to bite me in the ass for all the bad stuff i did in school.

by the way...i know pot well....i dont know kettle that well.     ;-)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} nrr: how to punish children

Remember in the movie "Traffic" when that guy was torturing Frankie Flowers 
with some wicked can of RAID and a butane torch, or something?

Thats what I do to my little bastard children.

When I run out of RAID I usually have left over table and chair legs.

Nothing says "quit whining" like a fractured cheek bone.

This one time I dropped a refridgerator on this little brat when he was 
running around my backyard pool.

Next time I should push him in with the pool cover on.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

I hope you're kidding.  EDM needs as much real music as possible in it.

I forget who it was that said it, but you cannot be your child's best friend, 
you have to be their parent.  and that makes sense.  friends talk about 
problems (usually), parents wack their kids.

it was sweet as hell when ppl were sampling stuff like sepultura drums and 
percussion and nobody noticed it...but now everyone is sampling riffs and i 
agree...its getting annoying.


if anyone can sample a riff and mangle it to the point of 
un-noticable....that wouldnt be to bad either.

>yeah, you gotta keep up with the status quo. 

you know (+ 500 STPs) i was just thinking the other day about how 
i need to hear more horrible music with guitars. like i saw in 
rolling stone that they gave a band consisting of irrelevant 
rockers (gun's + pilots or whatever theyre called) and i realized 
just how great it is that in our country any idiot with a guitar 
and a drug problem can write poor cracker poetry over a ripped off 
lick and become an icon for white youth. like, i just cant get 
enough dashboard confessional. it makes me so happy to hear white 
people cry like fucking 2 year olds about how horrible their lives 
are after selling millions of albums. that must be really 
devastating. and fucking new found glory. those guys are the bomb. 
i miss limp bizkit, they were fucking deep. i love how fred durst 
has a tattoo of kurt cobain on his chest because theyre so 
similiar. i cant wait till they do their "EDM" album. that will be 
the bomb. they can get crystal method and fatboy slim and fred 
durst together in a studio so they can do coke and write garbage 
music with guitars in it because you know thats what real music 
sounds like.

Subject: {pb-cle} punishing children

New reports show that, in addition to today's children being "fucking
irritating" and "in need of wacking," today's 20 to 30-year-olds, most of
whom have never raised children, are far more opinionated about shit that
they know nothing about.  Armed with anecdotal evidence and suffering from
queen bee syndrome, they post their findings on such useful forums as rave
mailing lists knowing that any actual parents are low in attendance and
therefore unable to disagree with them.  Said one childless 20-something,
"Kids are like, annoying and stuff. Their parents should like, hit them or
something.  That's what my parents did and I roolz.  My dad taught me how
to spell by hitting me with a shoe every time I got a word wrong and now I
spell words by replacing letters with numbers.  Straight becomes str8. 
Isn't that awesome?  For realz, kids got no respect and shit.  Kids should
respect me cause, like, I dunno, I'm the greatest."
Humiliation, being the main discipline tactic for centuries, continues to
produce no results, but as one former raver so eloquently put it, "So?" 
This indicates that the humiliation tactics used on him succeeded in
making him bitter against children with actual personalities.
Today's 20 to 30-year-olds also know everything about welfare, feminism,
and guns and are like, the shit and give a shrug and a well-thought-out,
"I don't give a shit," when confronted with the fact that everyone's
situation is different.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} punishing children

why should anyone chill...its pretty easy to see that our parents generation 
fucked up with all the lovey dovey crap....if our parents were as hard on us 
as their parents were on them...this country wouldnt have half the problems 
it does.

kids tell their parents what to do...they tell their teachers what to 
do...hell they even tell the principals and higher educators what to 
do....and u know what....if the kid still isnt happy....they call child 
services...its pretty fucked up

this isnt anecdotal evidence....i work in a school...i see the shit going 
down first hand every day...u know how many times ive heard a kid call 
his/her mother a bitch this year?  do u know how many teachers were assulted 
at the k-8 school i work at this year?  do you want to know how many guns 
and knives were brought to the school this year? do you want to know how 
many of the 7th and 8th graders were expelled for bringing drugs to school?  
i dont even work in the worst part of cleveland either...the school i work 
at is in old brooklyn(ben franklin)...u know they expell kids daily from 
east tech, east high, glenville, and collinwood for guns and gang violence? 
u know that glass and doors have to be replaced daily at those schools 
because kids are thrown thru them?

guess what...none of that ever hits the news...u know why....the media isnt 
allowed on board property without authority of chief legal consul or the 
CEO.

all this bleeding heart crap with the kids has to stop..the 20 year 
experiment has failed...and its time to go back to beating kids.

so are this generations parents doing a good job? id have to say no.


u can quote me on all of that.



Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

I just do this to vent.  Tom cox is just doing the normal tom cox "I 
don't aggree with it so it sucks" attitude he so lovingly does to all 
topics (and in response to this one as well, no doubt).

I still stand by my saying that the people that keep using children 
as skapegoats to get what they want should still be taken out to the 
streets with the spammers and stoned to a bloody pulp.  I f#$%ing 
hate those people. 

Not to go off on a tangent here, but just take video games.  Because

"because it's not appropriate for children."  WTF?  if it is rated M

all over the place.  Or in GTA3 where I can have my way with a hooker 
then beat her down and get my money back.  I find that fun, I enjoy 
it, don't freaking get it banned because you don't freaking agree 
with it (like how GTA3 got banned in austrailia).

And that's just one example.  Then you get the people that let their 
kids run loose and expect other people to keep an eye out on them.  
I've seen this at several family outings.  Kid runs off, parents ask 
everyone where he went.  gee isn't it the parents freaking 
responsibility to look after them???

So I should start beating the shit out of my son now because other kids
misbehave?  No, really, I'm a parent, why don't you tell me what I'm doing
wrong since you seem to have it all figured out?
I'm not buying it.  Your knee-jerk reaction and seeing all of this in
black and white doesn't convince me.  You have no idea what kind of homes
these kids are coming from, you have no idea what their parents go
through, you have no idea what *their* parents went through.  A lot has
gone on in the past twenty years besides turning away from beatings as a
sole form of discipline that has affected our society so it can't just be
that.  Nothing is that black and white.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} punishing children

what im saying is what i see on a day to day basis, and what i read in the 
district security reports.

there are obviously shades of grey...but when you see the problems i see, in 
a huge district like clevelands you tend to get a pretty cynical view of 
children and parenting today...the real problem is nobody wants to take any 
responsiblity...the parents dont want to be responsible for the kids, the 
teachers dont want to  bear any responsibily if the kids fail, the 
principials dont want to take responsiblity for disciplining the kids except 
for the most serious offenders.

im sure if u walked a mile in my shoes you'd see what im saying...and if i 
walked a mile in your shoes id see your point.

but thats not going to happen, and we'll just have to agree to disagree.

Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope 
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

Well, seeing as how Tom and I have a child together, we'll have a whole
other perspective on the debate.
I suppose it's very Libertarian of me *shudder* to agree with you on the
video games and whatnot.  I've enjoyed the odd game of GTA3
myself...although I don't see much of the PS2 these days because, well,
I'm a working mom (and I deal with Tom Cox on a daily basis so I laugh in
the faces of you guys who get irritated with him because of some silly
flame war. ha, I say.  ha.) and I can't really devote hours to such
things.
I'm just saying, this Sadist trend in parenting freaks me out and it
irritates me that I'm going to be labelled a bad parent/bleeding heart
because I'd rather treat my child as a human with faults and lessons to
learn than as a dog who needs obedience training...or that immediately
upon giving birth I should remain in the house with my child at all times
unless I can absolutely guarantee that he will be on his best
behavior...all in the name of appeasing other adults.
On the other hand, a gallery owner in SF was punched in the face by some
good ol' boy for displaying a painting of the Iraqi prisoner abuse.  If
we're allowed to just deck the people that we disagree with, things should
get a lot more interesting.  Hell, Nick S could beat the kids AND parents
in his school district!

I wouldn't consider not beating your kid sensless as being a bad 
parent at all, those are the ones that people think are the bad 
parents nowadays.  My sister has two children and I don't think has 
struck either one once, and they turned out fine, so far at least.  
Although the boy was once told to go to his room and responded "no, I 
don't have to if I don't want to" and was then dragged up the steps 
to his room :) .  He is in kindergarden and has had some major issues 
because the teacher yells at the class and he takes it personal, even 
though he's the type of person that would give you the shirt off your 
back if it would fit :)  He was even afraid to go on the school bus 
because of all the stuff kids did on there, to the point that he was 
throwing up.  It's really quite sad when I think about it, but I 
guess he's gone to the schools guidence counselor and I guess things 
are better.  btw, this is all happening in streetsboro, a typical 
suburbia city.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} punishing children

I'd just like to make a casual observation on this thread:

I've realized this list is getting old and maturing when the talk turns
away from candy kids to raising kids. ;-P

If you would have asked me in 1996 if y'all would be talking about how
to be good parents, I wouldn't have believed it.

Carry on.

Yes, dude is pretty much one of the biggest dorks I've seen. He quite
obviously is fucking feeling the music though. Hard ass haters that only
lurk in the shadows afraid to dance, in order to protect their image, are
far more pathetic in my mind.

Big Up to the dork massive!!

(although the very end of that video was a little disturbing, I'll admit)

The principals don't have TIME to discipline anyone except the most extreme offenders, the teachers are either 1.  scared by some of the kids 2. overwhelmed they need to by psychologists and counselors rather than teachers 3. bound by law to not be able to do much 4.Told what to do by the parents, and spend half their time tryign to explain to the parents they have no clue what goes on in the classroom
 
I don't think it's a problem of parents not disciplining their kids with more physical punishment---it's a problem of them simply not even being there, or not setting any kind of example.  These kids are not only not getting physically punished they're not getting ANY kind of punishment.  In Cleveland, a large problem is that a lot of the parents ARE kids. It's not a problem with "lovey-dovey crap" nor lack of "physical discipline"  it's a problem with drugs, violence, absent parents, incest, physical abuse and mental abuse, alcoholism, and unemployment---some of those kids who are the most troublesome have truly been in some f-ed up situations. 

I think a mom who doesn't want to physically punish her kid(s) should be commended---if she's on here talking about them, thinking about how to best discipline, and concerned about her kids and how they're raised those kids are going to be just fine. 
 
Beating kids is only going to teach them that violence is indeed the solution to everything, and whoever is stronger wins.

there are obviously shades of grey...but when you see the problems i see, in 
a huge district like clevelands you tend to get a pretty cynical view of 
children and parenting today...the real problem is nobody wants to take any 
responsiblity...the parents dont want to be responsible for the kids, the 
teachers dont want to bear any responsibily if the kids fail, the 
principials dont want to take responsiblity for disciplining the kids except 
for the most serious offenders.

im sure if u walked a mile in my shoes you'd see what im saying...and if i 
walked a mile in your shoes id see your point.

but thats not going to happen, and we'll just have to agree to disagree.

this is the conundrum of major label musicians. the things that
motivate you to write music when youre broke are different than
the things that will motivate you when youre mad rich. if youre
whiny when youre rich, it just looks like youre a whiny rich
prick. this is why so many bands go downhill after they have more
and more success, they cant write about new and interesting things
without sounding like pricks. you can really count on your hands
the number of great bands who actually get better with time:
radiohead, the beatles, rhcp, etc. usually once their initial
drive is taken away they become useless: pearl jam, rage against
the machine, etc.

You forgot wesley willis, but then again, he was a one man band.

Going from 'suck a cheetahs dick' and 'i whopped batmans ass' to 
intensely deep things like 'suck my dogs dick' and 'suck a 
pitbulls dick'... and who can forget the collaboration he did with 
pimp daddy welfare "easy e tried to kill me" ?!?!

So true.   Money corrupts/changes/erodes the drive of the artist.   Its hard to hate on the man with the same angst and passion when he's hooking you up with millions.  Its harder to sing broken heart songs when girls are lined up to get with you.

I would add Primus to the getting better w/ age group.  I saw them this weekend and it off the charts greatness.  Check them out if you can.



this is the conundrum of major label musicians. the things that
motivate you to write music when youre broke are different than
the things that will motivate you when youre mad rich. if youre
whiny when youre rich, it just looks like youre a whiny rich
prick. this is why so many bands go downhill after they have more
and more success, they cant write about new and interesting things
without sounding like pricks. you can really count on your hands
the number of great bands who actually get better with time:
radiohead, the beatles, rhcp, etc. usually once their initial
drive is taken away they become useless: pearl jam, rage against
the machine, etc.

  Its hard to hate on the man with the same angst and passion when
he's hooking you up with millions.  Its harder to sing broken
heart songs when girls are lined up to get with you.

exactly, you hit the nail on the head.

i missed them this time around, but ive seen them live about 5 or
6 times starting in 93 and theyre definitely one of the best live
bands ive ever seen.

Bill is FOR techno, not IS techno.

THE DJ LIST (The world's largest DJ Directory) states that Ian Van Dahl IS 
techno.

Behold:

They say you have your whole life to write your first album...and then only 
a year or so after that. Less time, less issues. I don't see how much 
diversity a band can experience while on tour for 9 months. Maybe I'm wrong.

I would think that the real gifted artists are more concerned with self 
actualization rather than material success.... which is often why those same 
artists die poor and dissastisfied.

<shrug> its hard for me to empathize with those sort of challenges due to my 
inexperience...

Which is why RHCP is a great band.  They seem to release albums 
after you've almost forgot about them, much longer than a year.  
And their fans dont seem to get too antsy about them releasing an 
album every single year.

Any time you have a bass player as fucked up as flea, I dont think 
you'll ever lose inspiration on things to write about.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} WTF Ian Van Dahl techno?


I bought an Ivan van Dahl record just so i could snap it infront of this 
annoying twit who kept asking me to play it week after week.

it was worth the 5 bucks - and was probably the flimsiest piece of vinyl 
i've ever held.  she said she didn't want the pieces when i offered them to 
her.

LOL.

I did that once with NKOTB.   I played it at the wrong speed first though,
so I could rip it off the turntable and break it for everyone to see.  The
girl threatened to sue me because a piece of the vinyl hit her.

too funny.

Subject: {pb-cle} DJTwo - Will Spin for Foos

Two, I am rocking your Will Spin for Food mix right now. That shit is high
energy, and its fucking awesome. How much of the scratching is your
turntablism, and how much of it is engineered into the tracks? The answer
isn't really important because it's hot shit either way. I am just asking
for sake of curiousity. Keep doing your thing man, you sound excellent.
Can I burn some copies for friends? Can I just throw your cell number on
the disks, or do you have alternate contact info for people who express an
interest in bookings? I highly recommend giving it a listen for all you
listees who like your beats broken and haven't gotten the chance yet,

Les started using the virus b with the frog brigade about 2-3 years ago. I 
saw them last fall when they did their first tour back with the original lineup, 
and it was off the hook.  Last time around they played two sets, the second 
set was the enitre "Sailing the Seas of Cheese" lp in its entirity. This time 
around the second set will be the copmplete "Frizzle Fry" LP.

Other tours im looking forward to this summer:

The Dead (normally I wouldn't give a shit, but Warren Haynes is takin Jerr'y 
place & playing a solo accoustic set to open.  IIf you don;t know Warren, 
cehck him out asap, he is an amazing guitar player)

Dave Matthews w/ Keller Williams : DMB is always a great show, Keller is off 
the HOOK, a one man band type of thing, everything is loop based, he'll play 
bass, guitar, percussion, sing, and play a "gutiar synth". 

Medeski, Martin & Wood - pure class

Widespread Panic - great southern rock throwbacks

id rather hear all of seas of cheese. the best track from frizzle
fry is one they play live all the time anyway, "too many puppies".
i saw them tour for pork soda so i got to see my favorite stuff by
them live. "my name is mud" live is one of the greatest things
ever, right up there with tool doing "opiate". ah, early 90s alt
rock was the shit.

Subject: {pb-cle} another blow to Pittsburgh

As some you already know, I've been writing for Pulp, one of Pittsburgh's
alternative arts & entertainment newsweeklies, for a few years now. 
Today, I found out that, effective immediately, Pulp is shutting down. 
The last issue came out today.  There will be no fanfare or farewell
issue, as the editors of Pulp just found out about this yesterday
afternoon.
I'm pretty sad about this.  In addition to being the publication that
first put my words into print as a lowly intern and allowed me the
opportunity to grow as a writer, it exposed a lot of the great things that
are going on in this city, despite the economic shambles that it is
currently in.  While there is always room for improvement (I was always
quick to complain about the lack of diversity that it showed in its music
coverage), Pulp has always had honorable intentions and really did want
the people who lived in Pittsburgh to realize that it is a pretty great
city.  It's not New York, it's not San Francisco, it's *Pittsburgh* and
there's all of this exciting stuff going on.  We should be proud.
In the end, however, the money just wasn't coming in as much as it needed
to and those are the hard facts that needed to be faced.
My sadness may seem silly to a lot of you, but I truly feel that we are
losing a great asset.  I am hopeful that a new paper will be able to rise
from Pulp's ashes and perhaps fill the void that it is leaving.
Kelly

Pittsburgh's fucking great, except for well, the jobs.

Big hug, and good luck in the future; you've written some good stuff
for Pulp.  :)

I am sorry that Pulp will no longer be coming out. It was a very enjoyable
read. In addition, I just want to say that I think the email address
"vaginasaurusrex@soregroin.com" is a cake taker.

Subject: {pb-cle} TODAY::Clifton Arts Festival::10 hours 10 djs SPECIAL EDITION

10 hours, 10 djs SPECIAL EDITION::TODAY, SATURDAY::June 12::CLEVELAND


This is a special saturday one off edition of 10 hours, 10 djs, again with
return performances. We will be starting at NOON and running until 10pm,
followed by Mike Metz' saturday night residency.


This coincides with the Clifton Arts Festival where Clifton will be closed
for a block or two east of w117th. There will be tents, exhibits, shows and
more, along with lots of fun house parties. Stop in Twist for a drink and
good tunes!


12-2__JASON SODITCH and MARK STRAUSS__
A last minute change in our lineup brings two talented house maestros
together for a two hour tag-team set.


2-3__misterbradleyp__Brad has brought so many of my favorite shows the last
year, and is also a very talented dj.  Brad says that he is digging in the

Subject: 	NEXT FRIDAY, JUNE 18TH - Go Media is proud to present The art 
of Design Gallery Exhibit
Date: 	Thu, 10 Jun 2004 15:27:32 -0400



<http://www.gomedia.us>
*WHAT:* MIXED MEDIA, The Art of Design gallery exhibit showcasing the 
works of Clevelandâ€™s own Go Media Inc.

*WHEN:* Friday, June 18th 2004 from 7pm-11pm

*WHERE:* The All New Atmosphere Art Gallery 2335 West 11th St 
<http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?country=US&countryid=250&addtohistory=&searchtab=address&searchtype=address&address=2335%2BWest%2B11th%2BSt.&city=Cleveland&state=Oh&zipcode=&search=%2B%2BSearch%2B%2B>., 
Tremont Village of Cleveland

Rarely do any commercial graphic design firms have a reason to showcase 
their work in an art gallery, however Cleveland based Go Media is an 
exception. Go Media was founded by freelance Illustrator and Designer 
William A. Beachy of Cleveland (formerly Graphic Odysseys) and 
Multimedia Specialist Christopher Wilson (formerly Next Level 
Multimedia) of Akron. The two shared a common interest and passion for 
creating compelling cover art, predominantly for the nightlife and 
underground music scenes. Since the two artists have combined forces, 
their work has gained national recognition and commissions by companies 
and promoters throughout the United States and Canada.

Please join us Friday, June 18th for the unveiling of â€œThe Art of 
Designâ€ at the all-new Atmosphere Art Gallery of Tremont. The Art of 
Design has been companioned with a new local event series called Mixed 
Media. The Mixed Media series seeks to bring together regional visual 
and audio artists for multi-sensory showcasing. The exhibit will feature 
more than 30 pieces from Go Media Inc. The exhibit will also feature a 
special 3-hour DJ performance by Doug Burkhart, the award-winning 
founder of Grand Poo-Bas Records. Select wines, Hors dâ€™oeuvres and V.I.P 
passes to the after-party will also be available to the guests.

The after-party will be hosted at Mecury Lounge 1392 W. 6th St. in the 
Warehouse District downtown Cleveland. Performances will include Dj 
Moose, Skyla, Jason Alias and others spinning everything from deep house 
to break beats.

TO VIEW OF SOME OF GO MEDIAâ€™S WORK visit www.gomedia.us 
<http://www.gomedia.us>

Special thanks to all of our clients who commisioned us to do some of 
our greatest design work. Your support and continued patronage is our 
driving force. We hope to see you at the show!

 >>Feel Free to RSVP by responding to this e-mail. 
<mailto:chris@gomedia.us?subject=RSVP%20Art%20of%20Design>

If you do not wish to recieve future e-mails from Go Media reply with

adam has reached that point where he can play whatever he damn
well pleases and will have better track selection than 99% people
who have been doing it much much longer than him. it really doesnt
matter what genre the guy plays. he could bust out some fucking
hiphop and he'd still be playing the hot shit. don't sleep.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Bit Torrent Trackers

I've recently been enjoying the wonders of Bit Torrent, but I'd like some
suggestions on good, searchable trackers. Can anyone help me with some
links that let me identify the locations of seeds for shows, movies, apps,
etc? Thanks.

well, for anime stuff, I really like http://www.boxtorrents.com/  
although it looked like they had some issue recently that they are 
working on.

did a quick google search and looks like this site has a good listing 
of trackers and what they offer:
http://www.monduna.com/topics/bittorrents.html

I really don't use it for anything but anime stuff since the RIAA has 
been starting to crack down on this now.  figure they are going to go 
after the people downloading Lord of the Rings before people 
downloading love hina or something.

Saturday, July 3 
PETE MOSS 
 <http://www.petemoss.net/> http://www.petemoss.net 

A native of the New England area, Pete Moss began his journey through
the dance music scene by spinning as a DJ at local Boston venues and
parties. His skills advancing with every gig, Pete quickly found himself
spinning throughout the Greater New England area as his reputation
became known for keeping the dance floor jumping. This development led
to regular engagements, which have kept Pete busy for the last nine
years. Pete has played the likes of England, Scotland, Switzerland,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico and has toured throughout the United States. Some of
his more notable gigs have been at Twilo in New York City, Ministry of
Sound in London, Headstart with Josh Wink in London, Centrofly in New
York City, and the weekly Release party in San Francisco. Pete has also
held down the Ovum Records party at the Annual Winter Music Conference
in Miami for the last three years. 

Fond of Philadelphia, Pete Moss currently holds a Saturday night
residency at the infamous Fluid nightclub in the historic South Street
area known for its musical and cultural diversity. Pete entertains a
usually packed crowd of loyal and appreciative house heads who praise
Pete's skills by staying on the dance floor night after night. 

No stranger to the studio, Pete Moss has been receiving worldwide
attention for his production work for the last few years. Bridging the
gap between the DJ world and the producer's world can be tricky for even
the most talented DJ, but Pete makes it seem so very easy. Most dance
music magazines charted and reviewed his music and he has granted
numerous interviews shedding light on his auspicious past. Pete has been
noted in D.J. Mag, Muzik, Mixer, Ministry, Jockey Slut, Blues and Soul,
The Fader, 7 Magazine, URB, XLR8R,and BPM Culture. 

Currently, Pete Moss is an artist on the Ovum label and has worked with
well-known labels definity Records, Large Records, and Alola Records in
the UK. He runs his own label, Recline Records, and has 3 releases
presently available. Pete's journey has given him the opportunity to
work with the highly respected artist, Terra Deva, on a vocal
collaboration. 

The over-saturated dance music market means that a professional has to
stand out above the rest in order to make an impact. Pete's
accomplishments prove that he has the endurance to continue his journey
and his respect as a house music producer/re-mixer and DJ is second to
none. Look out for more music from Pete as he continues to advance the
art form he has come to love and appreciate. This young lion is
developing himself into the giant whose shoulders will bear the weight
of those he musically influences. House music and the dance music scene
will never be the same!

you know, Im not sure about this, but I'd imagine they are totalling all the
dollar amounts and saying "see?  the festival gives michigan a lot of
money", so be thorough.  I do not advocate exaggeration, because you would
not want to jeapordize the perceived validity of the results.  give no one
an excuse to short-change the festival (so to speak)

I know its been posted here, but this is about as important as 313 causes
get.

I think there should be a 5 dollar per day admission personally. although it
might discourage people that might otherwise wander in and "discover" the
music, it would also deter the idiots, or at least profit on them.

5 x 500,000 (conservative attendance with admission) = 2.5 million plus
whatever they can scrape up.

Subject: {pb-cle} i want your teebee records

ok so ive noticed ive become a little obsessive about
collecting teebee tracks. except they are hard as hell
to find online. so if anyone here has any tracks just
sitting around collecting dust id be more than willing
to take em off your hands. i'll buy em, trade for em,
whatever ya want. if youre interested send me an email
and i'll get back to you very soon. thanks

chinese whispers

The =8Cphenomenon=B9 known as Chinese Whispers stems from the game of the same
name. When passing information from one party to another (usually verbally)
the facts and theme often become distorted. A common example of this is see=
n
in rumors and gossip. Likewise, information passed by email is often

In reference to anyone in a public speaking setting, I equate the utterance of more than one "uhhhh"
as that speaker shouting "Hey! I am a gigantic asshole!" at the top of his/her lungs.

y'know...just like the people who, y'know, say "y'know" every four or five words....y'know?

And that's soooo public speaking 101.  Don't use filler words like uhhhh or 
y'know.  If your "slow headed" it's better to just put a pause in there then 
say anything, if you pull it off right, it sounds like a dramatic pause or 
something :)

Subject: {pb-cle} CDG4: 1 month away, no venue.

Well, ladies and gentlemen, this years CDG is looking bleek.  I 
have tried to find a venue for the event with no such luck.  Irish 
centre wouldnt return calls and the shadow lounge has an event 
that night.  My residence this year is out of the question to have 
a party due to space and neighborhood and the fact that it's a 
house owned by my roommate, not just a place that is being 
rented.  If anyone has any ideas on where to hold the event, 
reasonable priced venue or whatever, let me know, if not, then a 
tradition may die.  I'd prefer to keep the event free if possible 
if someone wanted to offer up a space, or knows of a space that 
can be used for 'cheap'.  

-Goose

FREQUENCY RESPONSE - Abbasso Underground Lounge

Soniktexture & Hoi Fans Recordings bring you hard & funky techno!!!



Friday June 18, 2004
NEIL V - www.concealedrecordings.com - Detroit

Born in Detroit and influenced by Detroit! Going back to his roots, his love for hip hop and r & b had him dreaming of writing and producing music, while owning his own record label. By the age of 16, Neil attended his first Detroit rave and discovered a new style of music. Instantly, Neil fell in love with the new sound he discovered and danced into the wee hours of the morning every weekend. It wasn't until 5 years later, at the age of 21, where he decided dancing wasn't enough. Neil saved up his money and bought himself a pair of turntables and a mixer and learned to spin what he loves...TECHNO! 

Six years later, with the influence by Detroit legends Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, and Robert Hood, his style is often compared to Adam Beyer, Marco Carola, and Misstress Barbara. Whether it's dark, minimal, funky, or hard techno, Neil V has the ability to shake and wear out dancefloors with his superb track selections. Quick mixing and technical tricks on 3 turntables has given Neil the opportunity to spin throughout the U.S. from the East to the West Coast. Neil has played along side with some of the bigger names in the industries such as Adam Beyer, Marco Carola, Christian Smith, The Kooky Scientist, Mike Dearborn, John Selway, Adam X and many more to name! 

Neil's hard work and dedication has brought him this far in his career in a short period of time. Recently with the dismantle of Techno City Records, a new era has begun with Concealed Recordings and a relocation to New York City in the near future!

Subject: {pb-cle} Tomorrow night in Cleveland!

Looking for something to do on a Friday night in Cleveland?
Drive over to Lakewood for the Neu! parties @ Capsule.

This week we proudly present electro/disco/techno artists from Italy:

Marco Passarani will DJ.  Marco is also known as Analog Fingerprints, 
Passarani, et.al.  He can be found on labels such as Generator, 
Plasmek, Peacefrog, Pigna, Nature, and has numerous remixes to his 
credit, not to mention appearances on compilations on countless labels. 
Marco has been making Techno and Electro tracks for over a decade now, 
and will be DJ-ing from a collection that no doubt spans that time as 
well.

Mat101-aka Jolly Music are featured on a number of different 
labels--let's see what we can list here:
Balance, Nature, Plasmek, Viewlexx, Ghostly International, Pigna, 
Illustrious, Clone, i220, Device and as JOLLY MUSIC:
Add to that Azuli, Final Frontier, Source UK, K7!, Astralwerks, 
Incredible and Ideal.  Not to mention two appearances on the mixes by 
Dr. Lektroluv.    Mat101 will be playing live!

Raiders of the Lost Arp is one of the members of Mat101 and Jolly Music 
working on a solo project of his own.  He can be found on all the same 
labels mentioned for Mat101.  Raiders is doing a live set as well.

Plus-opening DJ set by Cathryn Sunday.  Cathryn has been playing 
records for more than 10 years all over the western world-  until '96 
she was known as Sista Spinsta.  She has one mix CD on Peacefrog, Dan 
Curtin's "Web of Life" , and bought Capsule after finishing a 
university degree.


Oh!  by the way, other than a winning lotto ticket,
what could be friendlier to your wallet than a FREE show?
There is no cover at Capsule tomorrow night, or any Neu! night!

Hope to see you here!

Subject: {pb-cle} Starscape 2004

I want to go this year. It's been a while. No lineup yet but it's on July
24.

Who's planning on this? I'm trying to figure out how to handle it, because
if CDG4 doesn't go down then I'll just come to 412 and hitchhike from there.

The other option is charter busing. I've been looking at a 513 > 614 > 412 >
[410] > 412 > 614 > 513 trip but I'm not sure how many people would go for a
package deal of $100 for busing and the event. Tickets are $40 on their own,
so... It could be very much fun. No lodging would be needed because you
could nap on the bus.

Holla.

man, we had some fun baltimore trips.  people usually didn't want to fork
out the loot to go by bus.  i rented those biggie size vans a few times and
the price was right.  i think they seat 12 people.  i hit a deer one time
and 2 vegetarians seated in the very back threw up on the roadside as rich
peeled furblood from the exterior.  i wish i'd see some of those guys on
friendster - they showed me my first schmuffin.

i might cry

I'm definitely going to Starscape. I was planning on
flying however, unless something else comes up. I
didn't know anyone else going.

Subject: {pb-cle} Looking for advertising reps for Bassline ...

We need some more heads to help us. The mag is a big
undertaking for Lindsey and I and the few other people
who are helping out with this on a consistent basis.
Our greatest need right now in strengthening this
magazine is to find a few other dedicated people to
help us out with advertising sales calls and media kit
distribution. 

If anyone who feels they are qualified in making sales
calls (i.e. you don't have to have a degree, just have
a positive and outgoing attitude and the willingness
to promote Bassline) then we would really like to talk
specifics with you!

This is a volunteer position (no one's getting paid at
this point!) since we are just starting up. So,
whoever feels they have a couple extra hours in the
day and would like to get some experience for your
resume, or just want to help us out, please contact
us!

Thanks for your interest,
steph*c

Subject: {pb-cle} Saturday 6/19 in Cleveland - Choices, choices, choices...

Some updates and answers to frequently asked questions for Saturday's event...

We are working hard to setup a projection system for the event. Video 
installation artist Synthetik (from the May 1st "Burn the Phoenix" 
event) is lending equipment and expertise to make the projection 
installation a permanent Orthodox fixture.  Sharpshooter Phil 
Bradford aka Superunit (http://www.superunit.net) is busy shooting 
original footage and editing video to put the system through its 
paces.

Soon to be Frequently Asked Questions...

Q: What time does the show *really* start?
A: Doors open at 9:00pm and we start at 9:00pm.

Q: Why should I bring a picture?
A: Because you make the event - literally and figuratively.  Bring a 
picture (drawing, photograph, clipping, print, etc.) of construction 
or destruction and you get in for $5. The piece of artwork that is 
created will be digitized and uploaded to the website.

Q: Indoor event in the summer? Is it going to be hot?
A: If you mean temperature hot, no.  The building has A/C and it works!

Q: Why should I attend when there is X at the club, Y at the gallery, 
and Z at the theatre that night?
A: We are not a club, or a gallery, or a theatre but somewhere in between.

Q: Can I wear a costume or get dressed up?
A: Please do!  Remember the theme is "construction" or "destruction."

Q: Do you need help?
A: Yes! Pass the word to a friend or two.  If you have other specific 
ideas email Ramzi@ramzisrareaudiovisualexperience.

Q: Are you looking for bands, djs, performers, vjs, etc.?
A: Yes! Email Ramzi@ramzisrareaudiovisualexperience.  Better yet, invite them.

Q: What is the deal with the name "Ramzi's Rare Audio Visual Experience"?
A: The shorter names were taken.

Hope to see you there!

Jassen Ramzi Tawil

Subject: {pb-cle} Dylan  (Freak Recordings) :: Columbus :: June 23 :: @ Nyoh's

www.ColumbusParty.com presents 
Dylan (freak recordings UK) 


(June 23rd) *Special Event* ($5 before midnight / $10
after) 
Sound by both DaarSound Entertianment and Mecca
Studios 
9 - 12 = 4 DJ's on 4 Turntables [ DnB ] 
**set 1 = Shinma & Phazo 
**set 2 = POW & Hawstyle 
**set 3 = Phazo & POW 
**set 4 = Hawstlye & Shinma 
**set 5 = Hawstyle & Phazo 
**set 6 = Shinma & POW 
12 - 1 = Mr Tik Tak (Beat Machine INC/AZN Massive) -
Cleveland, OH - [ DnB ] 
1 - 2 = Dylan (freak recordings, obscene, rengade
hardware) - United Kingdom - [DnB] 


The Sultan of Sickness, Dylan needs no introduction
when it comes to drum & bass. The past few years have
seen this top DJ and Producer go from absolute
strength to strength, not only producing consistently,
but consistently good; proving him to be, without a
doubt, one of the hottest talents in the scene.

Dylan began back in the Electro era buying records and
mixing them up on a couple of budget turntables, He
then followed the music and studied all the different
genres, evolving from Electro to Hip Hop to House and
finally, his life…Drum n’ Bass! Taking the obvious
first step, Dylan played on the London pirate radio
scene with long time friend B Key for many years. His
shows were legendary, with exclusive track selections
and plenty of added humour to keep the listeners
entertained (…Dylan is definitely known as the
prankster to his friends!). Dylan decided to turn his
twisted mind to the production side of things,
scraping the money together for his first studio set
up, and started to master the sampler and computer
with B Key. They would spend every hour possible
getting to grips with the equipment, and soon had some
tracks complete - which they played to Danny Breaks.
This lead to the debut releases of Kosmos “Tighten Up”
and ”Liquid Beats”. By then, Dylan had definitely
caught the bug and hasn’t looked back since. He has
continued to produce killer after killer including the
anthem “Need You” with Ink, The“Inferno EP,Dominion
and Penitentiary to name a few. Releasing on renown
labels such as Metalheadz,Renegade Hardware, Outbreak,
Cylon, Timeless, Moving Shadow, Droppin’ Science,
Architecture, Musica, Biotic, XXX and has collaborated
with a slew of top producers in the scene including
Technical Itch, Friction,Paradox, as well as his own
projects ‘Faith in Chaos’ alongside Robyn Chaos, and
‘The Four Horsemen’ together with Loxy, Keaton, and
Ink. 

This past year has been a very busy one for Mr Dylan,
with the conception of his first solely owned label
“Freak Recordings” responsible for some of the years
hottest releases such as Knowledge Award winner Dkay’s
“Be There 4 U” and “Martians” as well as Mason
featuring Armanni Reign and Sharpness MC “Ruff Rugged
and Raw”. 2004 also sees Dylan taking his place among
the mighty soldiers of the legendary Metalheadz
imprint with tracks “Metaphor” and “Lost Dreams” an
honour for someone so consistently inspired by the
label’s releases over the years. Dylan and Robyn Chaos
(Anger Management) also started up the now
internationally renown “Therapy Session’s” in London’s
Shoreditch, East End, without a doubt providing some
of the deadliest mid week line-ups a junglist could
ever wish for (for a price so reasonable, it’s
practically theft!). 

>From his residency at the Renegade Hardware nights at
The End in Central London, to across the U.S., South
Africa, All over Europe, Puerto Rico and, of course,
the U.K., Dylan’s djing has been consistently
crippling dancefloors for years. His style ranges from
demented darkness to ghetto funk, always retaining
those trademark hard-driving, solid beats. The first
releases from Freak Recordings twisted sister label
“Obscene Recordings” and “Intasounds” (Alongside
1Xtra’s Bailey) already have the drum and bass public
in a frenzy! After the rock and roll exploits of the
XXX 29 date US “Technical Freaks” Tour earlier this
year alongside partner in grime Technical Itch, and
the WMC live show with Faith In Chaos in Miami, 2004
will see Dylan signing new exciting international
talent for his labels, releasing the Technical Freaks
Album in late May, producing more sickness himself,
and of course DJing solidly all over the World. PHEW!!
Always the one to watch out for, Dylan continues to
produce an onslaught of discothËque destroyers for
your listening pleasure….

Subject: Tuesday June 22nd - Dance to Defeat Bush feat. DJs for Common Sense
(D:FUSE/JAMON/DAMON)


> Hello all,
>
> I happen to think this year is a vital year in getting involved and
changing things. I believe there is no greater threat facing this nation
than the reelection of George W, and on this note, I've pledged to help
raise $10,000 to Moveon.org's national campaign. They will be raising 50
million to be used on voter registration drives, national TV ads exposing
the real Bush, and help to the Kerry Campaign. Below is an event we're
putting together in Austin, but if you don't live in Austin, or can't make
it to this one (we'll be doing another on Tuesday, July 27th) I encourage
you to click the link below and donate on my pledge page. Please forward
this out to anyone who might be interested. Lets get the word out!!!

Schmuffins are like honey from the nipples of Christ.

That said, I'll be at Starscape, even though it's a wee bit light on

Ok in case any one missed this message the first time around, here goes..... If anyone would like a copy of my new mix "will spin for food" it can be downloaded from http://www.djtwo.ultrasoundz.net . You'll have to download each track seperately or you can email me at two@ultrasoundz.net and I'll drop an original in the mail. I've gotten a lot of good reviews from people and quite a few of the tracks I spun are still not available in the U.S. I welcome feedback also. Hit me up,
two

FREQUENCY RESPONSE - Abbasso Underground Lounge

Soniktexture & Hoi Fans Recordings bring you hard & funky techno!!!


TONIGHT - JUNE 18, 2004

NEIL V - www.concealedrecordings.com - Detroit

Born in Detroit and influenced by Detroit! Going back to his roots, his love for hip hop and r & b had him dreaming of writing and producing music, while owning his own record label. By the age of 16, Neil attended his first Detroit rave and discovered a new style of music. Instantly, Neil fell in love with the new sound he discovered and danced into the wee hours of the morning every weekend. It wasn't until 5 years later, at the age of 21, where he decided dancing wasn't enough. Neil saved up his money and bought himself a pair of turntables and a mixer and learned to spin what he loves...TECHNO! 

Six years later, with the influence by Detroit legends Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, and Robert Hood, his style is often compared to Adam Beyer, Marco Carola, and Misstress Barbara. Whether it's dark, minimal, funky, or hard techno, Neil V has the ability to shake and wear out dancefloors with his superb track selections. Quick mixing and technical tricks on 3 turntables has given Neil the opportunity to spin throughout the U.S. from the East to the West Coast. Neil has played along side with some of the bigger names in the industries such as Adam Beyer, Marco Carola, Christian Smith, The Kooky Scientist, Mike Dearborn, John Selway, Adam X and many more to name! 

Neil's hard work and dedication has brought him this far in his career in a short period of time. Recently with the dismantle of Techno City Records, a new era has begun with Concealed Recordings and a relocation to New York City in the near future!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Fw: Dance to Defeat Bush - DJs for Common Sense

former sunshine kids man matt cohen is pretty involved in squashing any
ounce of (cough) credibility bush might have left.  i've probably mentioned
it before, but check out his website http://1115.org - can't believe the guy
influenced me to give money to a political campaign.  i must be getting old.

Subject: {pb-cle} Sound Forge

My upstairs neighbor just got his hands on several hundred HOT
(metaphorically, not heisted) pieces of viynl, and he has been rocking
shit. I tried to put my copy of Soniq Foundry Found Forge on his PC, but
somehow my disk got corrupted. Would some kind hearted individual consider
throwing me a copy? The pdf of the user's manual would be greatly
appreciated too. I'll post the ftp url if anyone would be kind enough to
throw something up there. Rest assured this is the farthest thing from
piracy, so don't be concerned about that sort of thing. I have several
licenses so of course there is no blood no foul. If posting there is
something you're worried about, just let me know and we'll work something
else out. This is a great friend of mine, and I am just trying to help him
out because I want him to pursue a release. He's blowing my mind... as
long as you like your beats broken and dirty, you'll like this.

Also, I know its been said on here before, but I can't recall the details.
Some of you have mentioned the Delta44 as being a good sound card. He
wants to take preamp outputs from some live instruments in his band the
claymores, run them through a multitrack mixer, and then into the box.
Another example of why the soundforge would be so useful. I told him I
think he can find something worthy in the $100-150 range. Recommendations
please?

Thanks for all the useful info I get from you great people.

B

Subject: {pb-cle} Re: Sound Forge

Damn, time to check myself. The retardation is running deeper than I
initially imaged, I couldn't send the *pre* fuck up message. To sum up: I
need a copy of sound forge 5, and perhaps the pdf user manual. I would
like someone to ftp it up, or contact me if they prefer another method.
Its totally legal, I got licenses, just a corrupt disk.

Also I recall mention of Delta44's, but not the details. I my boy is
looking to take preamp outputs from the amps of several live instruments,
via their preamp outputs. They'll go to a multitrack mixer and then on to
the sound card in his PC. That's what the sound forge is for, and that's
why the card needs to be decent. I told him $100-150 was a good range.
General consensus on that, and suggestions on the right card?

Also, he's been spinning some sick mixes, but doesn't know how to use his
computer too well yet. I want to help him get this dopeness on plastic so
the word can hear the goodness.

Thanks again.

its funny, i can tell the difference between many very similar 
sounding techno tracks, but rock songs all sound the same to me

I'd be happy if someone came up to me after a set and asked how I was able to 
find one song that's an hour long.  that's how it should be.  You shouldn't 
be able to tell when your switching to a new song, that's why it's called 
mixing.

I assume you have only heard the pop-punk that is on MTV and the radio, 
which does sound quite similiar.  However, as with all forms of music, 
there are lesser heard bands and sounds.

Sure, Blink 182, Sum 41, Yellowcard...they all have a very similiar sound, 
but when you start going beyond that stuff, there is a lot of variety:

Ima Robot
The Matches
Coheed and Cambria
 From Autumn To Ashes
Atreyu
Donnybrook
Fall Out Boy
Hey Mercedes
The Pop Group
Evergreen Terrace
Bad Astronaut

and so on....

nah. my sister listens to all sorts of that crap, mostly the 
underground stuff though she does like some pop crap.

i know she listens to all of those for sure, the rest im not sure 
about. even their names all start to sound the same. to give her 
at least some credit she went ot some festival in NJ a couple 
weeks ago to see all these horrible bands and came back with a 
couple of hardcore bands' cds that werent atrocious. mostly she 
listens to poop on disc.

Yeah, I usually can too, because I've listened to enough to realize what 
points are used for blendings the tracks together.  comes in handy when I put 
mixes on cd I can do a pretty good guess at where all the mixes are.

i think if you cant tell the difference between 2 records in the 
mix, the deejay is playing boring records.

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 3

THREE (Hallucination Limited, Shaboom, Second-Hand Satellites) 

Ask most of the big DJs who their favorite DJ is, and more often than
not, the answer will be Tampa's legendary DJ Three. His word-of-mouth
afterparty in the wee hours of the morning at this year's 2004 Winter
Music Conference was packed with a who's who of the movers and shakers
in the dance music world.

Armed with a sound that borrows equally from vintage acid-house, soulful
techno, and modern dub, Three has taken it one step further year after
year from San Fran's legendary Wicked Crew party to NYC's Twilo to
London's Fabric and back again. Echoing his wide tastes as a DJ, his
production output (Second-Hand Satellites, Three A.M., Montage Men) has
captured a not-so-common cross section of dance floors from house to
techno, and all things in between.

Last year, the Hallucination Limited label was launched to turn his
genre-bending passion for good music into a platform for other
like-minded artists. With the label off and running, he's vowed to spend
more time this year where he's most at home -- behind the decks. Let's
help make him feel at home!

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 4

July 3, 2004

PETE MOSS (Ovum, Alola UK)

A native of the New England area, Pete Moss began his journey through
the dance music scene by spinning as a DJ at local Boston venues and
parties. His skills advancing with every gig, Pete quickly found himself
spinning throughout the Greater New England area as his reputation
became known for keeping the dance floor jumping. This development led
to regular engagements, which have kept Pete busy for the last nine
years. Pete has played the likes of England, Scotland, Switzerland,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico and has toured throughout the United States. Some of
his more notable gigs have been at Twilo in New York City, Ministry of
Sound in London, Headstart with Josh Wink in London, Centrofly in New
York City, and the weekly Release party in San Francisco. Pete has also
held down the Ovum Records party at the Annual Winter Music Conference
in Miami for the last three years.

Fond of Philadelphia, Pete Moss currently holds a Saturday night
residency at the infamous Fluid nightclub in the historic South Street
area known for its musical and cultural diversity. Pete entertains a
usually packed crowd of loyal and appreciative "house heads" who praise
Pete's skills by staying on the dance floor night after night.

No stranger to the studio, Pete Moss has been receiving worldwide
attention for his production work for the last few years. Bridging the
gap between the DJ world and the producer's world can be tricky for even
the most talented DJ, but Pete makes it seem so very easy. Most dance
music magazines charted and reviewed his music and he has granted
numerous interviews shedding light on his auspicious past. Pete has been
noted in D.J. Mag, Muzik, Mixer, Ministry, Jockey Slut, Blues and Soul,
The Fader, 7 Magazine, URB, XLR8R,and BPM Culture.

STEVE GERRARD (Bedrock/Wrecked Angle / Filta)

"Steve Gerrard is another DJ who is making a name for himself by
delivering great sets everywhere he goes. He always rocks it at Bedrock
when he plays." -- John Digweed 

Chris from Hybrid said in Muzik magazine, "Steve is one of the best up
and coming DJs I've heard in a long time. He has very similar tunes in
his box to me, actually - deep, progressive tracks that aren't too
shiny! I walked into a club recently and he was playing most of the
stuff I was going to play... God knows where he gets all those tunes!"

"unoffensive house music"

that phrase will forever stay with me from a couple sunday's back 
when you said it out at bikki.  For whatever random reason last 
night I sat thinking 'what if armand played in pittsburgh?  would 
he play static for 45 minutes then drop one bass note, watch 
people go nuts, then leave?'

i agree though, mixing isnt about making things sound like one 
track after another, it's about the segue between tracks that take 
you from one track to another, yet still keeping both tracks 
sounding distinctive in their own right.

i think djs should have board games and a salad bar in the dj
booth so they have something to do while the records are playing
out.  that way everyone is on the same page, no one is confused.

Subject: {pb-cle} CDG4: Tentatively on... dj's needed

Okay, so I've pretty much got a space in Northeast ohio now 
(mantua area thanks to donnie).  Now I'm just looking to get 
together the DJ's that are interested in playing again.  I'm 
looking for the DJ's that have played previous CDG's to email me 
back if they are interested for this year, it will be on July 17th 
from 5/6pm till 3/4am.  Also, if you know that someone is not on 
the list and you have their contact information, please forward 
this on to them.

In no particular order from memory:
Skillz 
Lee
Ratana
Jwan Allen
Tom Cox
Shawn Rudiman
Andy James
Boompsie
Colin Pierce
Mike Salamon
Dave Atkinson
Soniq Stylz
Moose

Uhh, then I go blank, and i'm sure i'm forgetting people, but if 
you're one of them, email me and let me know.  

Also, if you're interested in coming this year, email me and i'll 
add you onto the distribution list for the directions and info as 
the information becomes available.

Okay everyone. I want to throw a benefit party on July 24th and I need =
some help. I have a venue and it is small. Maybe eneough room for =
200-300 people. I need to know of who to get a hold of to help me. I =
have no idea how to get this thing started or who to call to help me =
organize it. It is going to be a 10 or 15 dollar party with hopes of =
making some sort of money to contribute to the benifit of a sick friend =
in the scene. She is dealing with a connective tissue disorder but can't =
get medical coverage due to it being already diagnosed. If anyone has =
suggesttions write me at deepvinyl76@prodigy.net thanks.

Politicians lying for political means. What a surprise.

Of course we all know that lying about a blowjob is an impeachable offence, while lying about the reasons for a war that kills hundreds of Americans is just peachy-keen.

The UN had gotten rid of the WMDs long before America invaded. There was no collaboration between Iraq and Al Qaeda. We've had Saddam for months now and still haven't been able to demonstrate either.

If you can't see these lies, you're nothing but a cheerleader (literally) for the Republican party. Your sense of being on a team has damaged your ability to think rationally.

(and that's all I'll say about it to keep Trout happy ;) )

Subject: {pb-cle} oh yeah...i bet you dont....

Know whats up...
yeah thats right here is some free shit for you from
the archives to hold you over while I finish up
original productions for a full album, two eps, and
several remix projects before HK hits the road again
in the US and CA then off on European tour in April
2005 with some big festivals lined up.

Thats right loyal devotees. Big Sister Helen Keller,
leader of the Molotov Rebellion Army has some free
gifts for you to hold you over until the new releases
are out.  I was going through my archives and decided
to upload several of my dj mixsets. Some of them are
up to 4 years old but I have shared them with only a
few people so far. All were recorded freestyle on a
one shot recording, some of them live, so there are
imperfections...but fuck perfection
anyways...perfection is a plague. Got bandwidth...some
great mixes...diverse styles....and will only be
available for download for a limited time. So get them
while you can.  Be sure to right click and save file
as.

Tribute to the works of my friend and one of my
favorite current electro artists Danny Blanco aka
Legowelt featuring some of his best tracks from his
many many side projects. 
http://www.experimedia.net/mix/helen_keller_-_blanco_overdose_mix.mp3
 
Eclectic mix of dark electro, neo-disco, and italo.

Early eclectic and moody IDM/Electronica mix.

A special mix devoted to all my ladies in waiting for
those sensual unoforgetable nights.

IDM/Electronica mix blending from downtempo into some
serious glitch and glitch-hop.

Hey all---I'm in the process of putting together a plate tectonics mailing list (**finally**)
Drop us an e-mail at plate_tec@yahoo.com if you want to be added.  I promise you won't get nearly as much mail as you do with this list, but there's a couple things coming up you may want to hear about (if you haven't already)
 
If you're a techno head (or tech house, or minimal tech) and think you want to hit a show in Cleveland we'll try to send out info. as things come up (I know ~~as if you don't get enough from here, forums, bulletin boards, etc...)
 
Some of you may be on this list already for whatever reason, but send a note anyhow if you're not sure.  If you do get mail from us and don't want it don't let me know---it's all good. 
 
~Valerie

people need to stop saying "EDM". it sounds like a trade school or mental

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} car audio solution

whatever happened to the empeg idea?  I remember following this 
closely when it was being developed, now i see that they sold off 
their company, and i can't find any other in-dash (pc's?) that 
just have hard drives that you can save loads and loads of mp3's 
to?

www.empeg.com to see the original idea that came to mind.

Thursday, 06.24.04 ::   ALIAS @NATION + Alchemy

DAWN OF THE ICONOCLAST

An iconoclast can be unpleasant company. The original iconoclasts destroyed
countless works of art, which were the subject of controversy among
Christians in the 8th and 9th centuries. In addition to destroying many
sculptures and paintings, those opposed to images attempted to have them
barred from display and veneration. Twelve centuries later, the modern
iconoclast attacks such things as ideas, beliefs and popular institutions
and opposes successful ventures of which they are not a part. Today the
iconoclast is commonly known as the =B3hater=B2.

OK, I'm not intimate with downtown Cleveland (havnig only been there sober and with full control of
my faculties a couple times), but it's NEAR where Prospect and Huron intersect at an angle....

The best I can offer is that it's DIRECTLY across the street from the SBC building, if that helps at
all.

Good place. Decent lunch prices.

winking lizard is in cleveland.

also in cleveland is the harbor inn...i think they have like 260+ different
beers.....the harbor is the best bar for beer drinking...the prices are
definately more in line than the winking lizard or the boneyard.


Jungle is the metabolic pulse of a body reprogrammed and rewired to cope
with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

Subject: RE: Re: {pb-cle} beer?

The Winking Lizard downtown is on Prospect Ave, just down the street from Abbasso (Bottom's Up). The Lizard is west of E9th, Abbasso (Bottom's Up) is east of E9th. So if you're headed north on E9th toward the Lake, you'd make a left to go to the Lizard, and a right to go to Abbasso. 

Check it out this Friday: You can have dinner at the Lizard then imbibe on the drink specials for the Three (Hallucination) party: $2 16oz drafts, and $5 Red Bull bombs at Abbasso. They're within walking distance of each other, and if there's a Tribe game and traffic has cleared out, usually free parking on the streets.

Subject: {pb-cle} "DJ Three" by Sean Cusick

DJ Three 
Hallucination: One Nation Under A Groove 
Interview by Sean Cusick 

There are very few DJs in America who have been able to build a name for themselves solely on their DJing skills. Three is one of these DJs. Many DJs gain the status they have through their production work and their 'media hype machines' rather than by their actual performance on the decks. Tending to rely on agents and managers to create what otherwise wouldn't exist for them: fame, and for some fortune, Three has selectively avoided the spotlight of this type of success by managing all of his own affairs. Carefully selecting when, where and how he playsâ€”one of the hallmarks of an artist with carefully vested interests. This article is actually one of the few that has ever even appeared on him mostly due to the fact that he says what he needs to say in a club and on the dancefloor, not in magazines. 

Itâ€™s not so much that Three is a closed book, it is more that his complexities make him appear aloof and distant sometimes. His concerns outweigh his social graces and for this he makes no apologies. In a time when terms like "electronica" are floating carelessly through the minds of the masses, a concerned and active participant might rightfully seem worried, yet detached, His concerns for dance music are present even down to the smallest of details because the smallest of details are the difference between what makes a night astonishing and a night that simply was. I was sitting outside 'The Rubbâ€™ in Tampa with him one night at one of their bigger parties. Everything was going perfect and sounded fine. Right at the peak of the night he commented that maybe he should drive home and get better needles to help the sound out a little bit! I said, "Maybe you should get me another beer." We settled on getting beer on the way. 

If one of the goals of DJing is to express yourself musically, then I would be hard pressed to name even a few other DJs who express themselves as well as Three. I'm not talking about turntable tricks and tattoos, I'm talking about using the tools of DJing as the very instruments themselves. He seamlessly presents each record as if it is a journey out of one space into an even more exciting and inviting one. Rather than relying on merely playing tracks that are self contained adventures, he makes the mixing and the feeling of musical movement the show that it is, one that is 'in and of' itself. I have to admit: as a DJ there has been more than once when I think I have him all figured out, and then he pulls the musical rug out from underneath me and reveals the dancefloor that was lurking underneath, which brings me to the other goal of DJing: he rocks the dancefloor. 

In a day when so many DJs fall back on imitation and formula, Three is a constant reminder that you should always be trying harder and striving to improve dance music. Simply put: What he lacks in Formula, he makes up for in style. He is about as non contrived as a DJ can get. He honestly plays the music he believes in. The immediacy to this type of satisfaction is evident in the patient unfolding of his growing personal success. 

Over the years, trying to describe his DJing has never been easy because it is ever advancing, and changes to both create and maintain the moment. Using words like "instinctual" to describe his performance on the tables is pointless. It's not instinct so much as it is an incredibly acute perception to the vibes stirring on the dancefloor. This skill he has carefully developed over years of doing what he loves, out of the passion for the music. You have to remember that he's 'going there' as much as he's taking you there. He doesn't necessarily always need to know where he's going when he starts his sets, but he sure seems to know how to get you there, and he knows he's got you, and so do you! Not to say he doesn't have instinct, he has an unfair amount, but he's not trying to be a guru, he's a DJ. 

There's really no mystery to Three at all. His DJing is as self-explanatory as it can be. Armed with this talent, it doesn't take him long to earn a dancefloor's trust and respectâ€”valuable commodities in the waning â€˜90s. His unselfish work as both a local favorite and host DJ has, quietly and without media hype, built a wicked stop in Central Florida at parties in both Tampa and 'Simons' in Gainesville. Not content to just let a party happen, artists as diverse as Spacetime Continuum to Sasha and John Digweed to the Idjut Boys have enjoyed parties of the right size and vibe with Three's effort....whether he's DJing at the party or not. 

Affiliated with Hallucination Recordings, Three's production output for the public's consumption has been a bit less than prolific. Yet, after one listen to each remix, it's evident that 'Three as producerâ€™ has much to offer in terms of variation in sound and style. Three A.M. mixes of both Rabbit In The Moon's "O.B.E.â€ and "Floor.i.d.a." stand out as diverse and distinct efforts, both having been recognized as shining contributions for both the Hardkiss and Hallucination labels. 
"Floor.i.d.a." is scheduled to be released this month as a double pack, offering a wide array of mixes by all Florida talent. The Three A.M. mix has been one of my personal favorites for several months now. 

Much could be said about his influence on other DJs in Florida alone, but there is something more important than that: rather than surround himself with only like minded people, he's encouraged a whole generation of DJs to learn how to be themselves, and precisely why it's so important to do so. He's said it best himself, â€œâ€¦you need to learn all you can about the music, and incorporate all you know into your DJing and producing, but it has to be done in your own way." 

Every night of DJing should be an experiment in expressing yourself. You have to go out on a limb sometimes. Mostly it works, yet sometimes it may not, but having truly tried and failed is immeasurably more valuable than the alternative. Three is succeeding on his own terms. Check him out.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: need drugs

I won't have any health insurance until my husband gets a job or until my
job actually starts in August (I'm in training/classes until then). I have
7 Effexors left  -- and when they're gone, I will have horrible withdrawl
that will make me very sick. Withdrawl symptoms are nausea, dizzyness,
headache, and INTENSE mood swings that will make life suck for me, my
housemattes, and any unfortunate soul unlucky enough to be around me in
school or out anywhere.

So ... I am wondering if anyone has any of the following drugs to spare:
Effexor, Paxil, Zoloft, Prozac, or Celexa. I know I can mix them since
they're all really similar. Does anyone happen to have extra of
anything???

I know this is a long shot, but I figured I might as well try.

Thanks,

Amanda

Thanks a lot. That's helpful.

Coming from you that sounds fairly promising.

Hey Silvertits, are you up for a bus trip? Anyone else?

I think the ultimate would be some HDD Mp3 solution and a head unit with an
AUX in. If you're really slick you've got that AUX in remotely mounted
someplace proper.

Subject: {pb-cle} Today, Sunday  6/27 - 10 hours, 10 djs pt 8

SUNDAY:: JUNE 27::CLEVELAND
A FREE monthly showcase of Cleveland area dj talent:

10 hours, 10 djs. (part 8 )
The africanism edition

This month one of our djs will be collecting donations towards a
humanitarian effort in Kenya. On their trip they will be building dorms for
a school and donating any additional funds.

Some of the djs will be incorporating African vibes into their sets and a
basket for donations towards the trip will be available as well as
additional information. We hope you will show some generostity towards this
effort.


___4:30-5:30___
THE EXIGENCE
Some djs are known for their turntable skills, others for their production.
Eric is skilled at both and for today's set he will be performing original
compositions live ranging from trip-hop to breaks.

___5:30-6:30___
NOELLE
One of the original WAR crew, expect quality music here from a variety of
vintage hip hop, soul, and rare groove tracks. I always hear GREAT things
and I am looking forward to this set!!!!

___6:30-7:30___
SKYLA
A great attitude and dj skills to match! Skyla's friday night co-residency
at Mercury Lounge is a highlight of every weekend and her music selection
and energy will get this party jumpin' early!

___7:30-8:30___
RAMZI
Known as the founder of The Beat Matrix for playing just about anything from
power noise to soulful grooves. Jassen will be incorporating some original
material and African rhythms into his set this evening.

___8:30-9:30___
MATTHEW URBANIC
Preparing for his journey to Kenya, Matthew will be returning to the decks
for his first public appearance in over a hear. Matthew's groove is
responsible for deepening my appreciation for house music to the level it is
currently at. So welcome him back to the decks and if you feel so inclined,
make a donation for a good cause!

___9:30-10:30___
DAN PETROV
The Warm Art founder finally comes forth for his long anticipated first
10-10 appearance. Expect lots of techy goodness and treats at the forefront
of underground music.

___10:30-11:30___
DJ SPINCYCLE
The name might not be familiar to some of you, but let's just say Jerry
Szoka as a dj and founder of Grid Radio is a true innovator and an asset to
dance music in Cleveland. Thick tribal beats and quality dance music are the
order of the day this time around.

___11:30-12:30___
ROBIN HARRIS
Lady Harris, the Grande Dame of Cleveland clubbing, will be joining us for
one of her always entertaining sets. I'll say she knows how to work a room
like no one else and for her description I would like to quote the infamous
Andy Star in the Cincinnati Culture 7 News Letter: "I've seen her smoke a
ciggy, drink a drink, talk your ear off, cue the lights, and still enter a
mix at the break with no trouble."

___12:30-1:30___
KOPEC
You may see him out many different places, but have you heard him spin?
While Darrell is a diverse djs ranging from hard house to d&b, a little
jazzy and intelligent d&b to break up the evening is on the agenda.

___1:30-2:30___
MASTER JENNINGS
Winding the night down isn't happening this time around. Eric will be
keeping the energy high and showcasing his talent for all of you to
experience.

JUST ADDED: NEIL CHASTAIN & GUESTS ON DRUMS

Twist has an awesome roadside patio. Space is very limited out there and it
goes very quickly. Start time is 4:30 pm. You can go out EARLY and listen to
great music if you can't stay out late. Plus it's FREE!!

There is a "Make your own Bloody Mary Bar" in effect from noon on. This is
great hair of the dog, and a good way to start the afteroon.


All taking place at:

TWIST SOCIAL CLUB
11633 Clifton Blvd.
Cleveland-Lakewood, OH
216.221.2333

**We welcome any other types of artists at these events. If you want to
express yourself, please email doug@poo-bas.com to discuss it. We would like
this to be an open forum for many different types of talent.

** If you are a Cleveland area dj wishing to play these events -- you are
required to attend a few of them and get to know your peers. That's what
this is all about!

It was an amazing night with some nice dirty progressive.  His tracks made me drool...not that i don't do that normally :o).  The vibe was flowing from the beginning of the night with Mark & David waming it up.  If you were not there...well I don't recommend missing the next one with Pete Moss.

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 4

PETE MOSS (Ovum, Alola UK)
www.ovum-rec.com

A native of the New England area, Pete Moss began his journey through
the dance music scene by spinning as a DJ at local Boston venues and
parties. His skills advancing with every gig, Pete quickly found himself
spinning throughout the Greater New England area as his reputation
became known for keeping the dance floor jumping. This development led
to regular engagements, which have kept Pete busy for the last nine
years. Pete has played the likes of England, Scotland, Switzerland,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico and has toured throughout the United States. Some of
his more notable gigs have been at Twilo in New York City, Ministry of
Sound in London, Headstart with Josh Wink in London, Centrofly in New
York City, and the weekly Release party in San Francisco. Pete has also
held down the Ovum Records party at the Annual Winter Music Conference
in Miami for the last three years.

Fond of Philadelphia, Pete Moss currently holds a Saturday night
residency at the infamous Fluid nightclub in the historic South Street
area known for its musical and cultural diversity. No stranger to the
studio, Pete Moss has been receiving worldwide attention for his
production work for the last few years. Bridging the gap between the DJ
world and the producer=92s world can be tricky for even the most =
talented
DJ, but Pete makes it seem so very easy. Most dance music magazines
charted and reviewed his music and he has granted numerous interviews
shedding light on his auspicious past. Pete has been noted in D.J. Mag,
Muzik, Mixer, Ministry, Jockey Slut, Blues and Soul, The Fader, 7
Magazine, URB, XLR8R,and BPM Culture.

Get ready for a night of sexy, funky, uplifting, and decadent house
music!

The HeadRush Music Summer Series, Part 5

STEVE GERRARD (Bedrock, Wrecked Angle, Filta UK)
www.stevegerrard.net

"Steve Gerrard is another DJ who is making a name for himself by
delivering great sets everywhere he goes. He always rocks it at Bedrock
when he plays." -- John Digweed=20

If you're a fan of progressive breaks, then Steve Gerrard should be no
stranger to you.=20

In 1998, Steve won Muzik Magazine's Bedroom Bedlam competition, and 2
years later won the Ericsson Award for Best Bedroom Bedlam DJ. Since
then his career has gone from strength to strength. With influences that
range from Sasha and Digweed, Nick Warren and Danny Howells to Adam
Freeland and Hybrid and the technical skills of Anthony Pappa, he has
developed a unique style, which is: deep, progressive house mixed with
breakbeat, building steadily and creating a set which is more than the
sum of its parts. All the while keeping in mind that it is his job to
make people want to dance and keep on dancing.=20

Steve's mixes have been featured on such infamous dance radio shows such
as Pete Tong's Essential Selection and John Digweed's Kiss FM show in
London. He also mixed a CD for the cover of Muzik Magazine (December
2000). As if the life of a jet-setting wasn't enough, Steve's now also
focusing on production. He and studio partner Russell Pearce have
released tracks and remixes under the names Wrecked Angle (breaks) and
Filta (progressive). With releases on Minimal, Intrinsic & Choo Choo,
plus remixes for the likes of Baroque, Navigation and 3 Beat. John
Digweed, Sasha, Nick Warren, Anthony Pappa, Steve Lawler, Hybrid, James
Zabiela and Danny Howells have all been supporting their tracks.

Subject: {pb-cle} Beat Matrix 06.28.2004 | 91.1 fm

This week on the Beat Matrix I'll be providing the live mix.  I've 
been feeling kinda grimey lately, so expect some proper hard 
tunes, as well as my usual smoothness.

Electronic music on WRUW fm starts at 9:00 pm on Mondays, 
followed up by the Beat Matrix at 10:30 with the live mix at 11:00.

Tune it in to 91.1FM or stream at wruw.org.

setlists can be found at beatmatrix.net

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: need drugs


I won't have any health insurance until my husband gets a job or until my
job actually starts in August (I'm in training/classes until then). I have
7 Effexors left  -- and when they're gone, I will have horrible withdrawl
that will make me very sick. Withdrawl symptoms are nausea, dizzyness,
headache, and INTENSE mood swings that will make life suck for me, my
housemattes, and any unfortunate soul unlucky enough to be around me in
school or out anywhere.

So ... I am wondering if anyone has any of the following drugs to spare:
Effexor, Paxil, Zoloft, Prozac, or Celexa. I know I can mix them since
they're all really similar. Does anyone happen to have extra of
anything???

I know this is a long shot, but I figured I might as well try.

Thanks,

Amanda

I imagine you've already gotten replies to this...but I will answer as well.

Doode, that stuff's available all over the Intarweb for like cheap and
stuff. You can also get flexeril, soma, valium, and what not.

Not that I know this, I am just saying.

i like how "techno" is in with progressive and breaks. i went and 
looked at that section of the lineup and found 0 techno deejays 
listed. they didnt even have a single house deejay. just wall to 
wall crap. outstanding.

The Winking Lizard downtown is on Prospect Ave, just down the street from Abbasso (Bottom's Up). The Lizard is west of E9th, Abbasso (Bottom's Up) is east of E9th. So if you're headed north on E9th toward the Lake, you'd make a left to go to the Lizard, and a right to go to Abbasso. 

Check it out this Friday: You can have dinner at the Lizard then imbibe on the drink specials for the Three (Hallucination) party: $2 16oz drafts, and $5 Red Bull bombs at Abbasso. They're within walking distance of each other, and if there's a Tribe game and traffic has cleared out, usually free parking on the streets.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: guns?

Just a random email I got....

 
Did you Know??

 A.  The number of physicians in the US is 700,000.
 B.  Accidental deaths caused by Physicians per year is 120,000.
 C.  Accidental deaths per physician is 0.171.

 (US Dept. of Health &Human Services)

 How about this?

 A.  The number of gun owners in the US is 80,000,000.
 B.  The number of accidental gun deaths per year is 1,500.
 C.  The number of accidental deaths per gun owner 0.0000188.

Statistically, therefore, going to the doctor is approximately 9,000 times
 more dangerous than gun ownership.

in all honestly, posting something called "need drugs" on a public 
list is in poor taste, i dont care how desparate you are. i dont 
have to worry about some annoying cocksucker from my job sniffing 
for bad emails while im at work, but i understand that other 
people do. though this cutting up is getting pretty fun.

sidetrakkt productions presents:

ENDLESS REBIRTH:

Sidetrakkt's going-away party

Saturday, July 10, 2004
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

A sonic psychedelic journey guided by:

MIND WARPED - performing LIVE
(Soular Records - San Francisco, Konvocation - Maryland)

www.konvocation.com/?s=mindwarped

www.soularrecords.com

After recording as Time Warped on his own label, Panda Records, Mind Warped, aka Kent Friedman, exploded onto the international trance scene in 1998, becoming the first American to release psychedelic trance on an international label, with the track "People of Earth" on Boom Records (Holland). A full-length album, "Fluorolizard," followed in 1999. During this time, while also attending medical school, Kent began working with Hugh Sharpe on their project Shape Shifters, releasing on Krembo Records (Israel) and playing live across North America (including two Pittsburgh appearances at Sidetrakkt events). Kent has been instrumental in the formation of U.S.-based Soular Records, where his most recent releases can be found, including collaborations with Deeper In Zen. In addition, Kent is a member of the three-piece psytrance outfit Doppler Attack. We are honored to welcome back Kent as he makes his first Pittsburgh appearance as Mind Warped, where his music will certainly live up to its name! 

DOPPLER ATTACK - performing LIVE 
(Konvocation - Baltimore, MD)

www.konvocation.com/?s=doppler

A new type of electronic musical act, Doppler Attack is comprised of a DJ (Cyzum), a drummer (Mhatra, aka K. Cornelius) and a synth wizard (Mind Warped). Cyzum lays the beats, while Mhatra plays tribal percussion over top, and Mind Warped filters everything through effects, drops samples in realtime and mixes synth leads over the main mix. Doppler Attack pioneers a completely new type of musical performance, "real time remixing". We are excited to welcome them for their first Pittsburgh appearance!

CYZUM 
(Konvocation - Baltimore, MD)

www.konvocation.com/?s=cyzum

ELECTRIC MAYHEM
(Sidetrakkt - Pittsburgh)

SWEET CHAOS
(Sidetrakkt - New Wilmington, PA)

10 p.m. - 5 a.m.

$10 at the door

Shadow Lounge
5972 Baum Blvd. (corner of Baum and Highland)
412-363-8277

ALL AGES EVENT - b.y.o.b. for 21 +

This will be our final event in Pittsburgh before relocating to the Northwest. Thank you Pittsburgh for five great years!

for more information and directions:

www.sidetrakkt.com

(We recently switched hosts and have been having problems with our website.  We are working to fix this, but if our site is still down we will post directions to the list before the day of the event.  Thank you.)

hahahahaha. the key word being "accidental". if i put a gun to the 
head of a conservative who twists facts around and then pull the 
trigger, i certainly wouldnt call that accidental. 

aside from that, what were the "accidental" gun deaths involved 
in? being a jackass with a loaded weapon, thats what. so thats 
(according to these numbers, which oddly enough ARE NOT cited) 
1500 jackasses per year who just act like fuckheads. accidential 
deaths attributed to physicians are the result of TRYING TO SAVE 
PEOPLE IN AN INEXACT SCIENCE BY HUMAN BEING WHO ARENT PERFECT 
TRYING TO PRACTICE ONE OF THE HARDEST PROFESSIONS IN EXISTANCE. id 
say there's a pretty obvious difference there.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} What if I had posted, "NRR: Need Allegra for bad allergies?"

My take on the whole thing.

Amerikka has the FDA.  They schedule drugs for over the counter or 
prescription and then classify the prescription drugs.  If it's a 
prescription drug, get the prescription, if you need it bad 
enough, you will find a way to afford it.  Asking on a public list 
for someone to break the law and provide you with medication is 
not a valid request.  It's illegal.  We all pee in our own pools, 
and we have to deal with that.  Having no prescription insurance 
is not a reason to ask for someone to break the law and provide 
you with the medication you need.  Call a congressman or your 
president and talk about health care for all citizens so that your 
children (or other people's children) will have something in place 
that is less corrupt than the current situation.  Sell your 
computer on ebay.  Donate plasma for money.  Work a 2nd job 
washing dishes.  

On a somewhat related note, I'd like to thank the pharmaceutical 
companies for raising their prices to help offset the price of the 
free lunches I get all the time from the drug reps.  And let's not 
forget the happy hours and top shelf martinis.

This is something you can get over the counter though.
Someone would say take a Tylenol Allergy and sinus or
Claritin.

I think there is a big difference AND a reason why you
can't get Prozac over the counter.

Don't forget all that advertising you see on teevee about improving your 
emotions, your sex drive, make your boobs bigger (havent' seen those any more 
since people filed that lawsuit or something), grow hair, lose hair, etc.  I 
guess they do get more people asking about it so they keep on advertising and 
jacking up the prices.  Wasn't the last superbowl ads mainly drug companies?

As someone who has to take meds on a daily basis I know where amanda's coming 
from.  Would I post on a public list of a few hundred people (or something 
like that, right traaaaat?) that I can't afford it, probably not.  I'd 
somehow get money for it or build me a little stockpile to hold me over when 
I need to, etc

It's plain and simple, are whole health care system is messed up.  Prices are 
constantly going up, the FDA seemingly schedules drugs just on the basis that 
a lot of people use them for recreation.  There's a few examples I can think 
of off the top of my head but we're getting a little OT here (plug 
http://pb-cle-ot.lists.vrillusions.com/ :) ).  It's just messed up.

It's even more fun when I was the one that mentioned to you to set up a tunnel 
and tried to explain how it works.  Plus the fact that we're talking about 
this in email and we're both in the same room right now about 10 feet from 
each other.  Isn't technology great? :)

i went on a ski trip to vail that would have had robin leach excited,
thanks to a drug rep of a doctor i used to work for.  lots of business
tended to that week by the kings of upmc.  ppbbbbbb.

i did get to ride a lift with rob reiner though.  that was kind of ok.

lifestyles of the rich and heinous.  i seriously hate drug reps.  i've
never met one that was remotely close to being a decent human being.

actually the DEA has emergency scheduling powers, they basically can 
outlaw anything until it can be investigated later.  and that never 
happens.  the FDA does have powers too, ephedra they ruled was more than 
an herbal supplement and outlawed it with little to no discussion.  
canada followed our shining example.

I know, I still have that "laser" (actually led's) printer that the led array 
is all messed up because of "excessive force that was exerted upon the top of 
the casing" (trout punched the top of it) due to "the blockage of material in 
the intake system of said printer" (it jammed alot)

somewhere, a law is broken.  unless she uses her script at a 
pharmacy, anything other than that is illegal.

something is just ironic about someone with 5500 dollar tits that 
cant afford a psychactive med.

good ol' google to the rescue:
http://www.healingsearch.com/_ReportPages/energy_drinks_caffeine.htm
"We also know where it=E2=80=99s [caffeine] not in Canada, caffeine cannot =
be added to=20
clear pops and juices. But some companies may have found a way around the=20
rules.

Health Canada prevented Pepsi from adding caffeine to that beverage a few=20
years ago. The idea was that too much caffeine is bad for you and that it=20
should only be in drinks where we know to expect it like coffee, tea and co=
la=20
drinks."

So apparently it's only allowed in coke, and it's regulated to 36mg accordi=
ng=20
to that page.  Since mt dew is clear, it can't have caffeine.  ugg, mt dew=
=20
without caffeine.

and if your looking for a "caffeine is bad, mm'kay?" page, here you go:
http://www.cspinet.org/canada/caffrelease.htm

I think her point was that if she had posted needing medication for a more
well-known "physical" condition, rather than a mental one, she wouldn't have
had such a reaction since mental conditions are still viewed as "fake"
illnesses in this country, yet another symptom of our self-indulgence.
(However, "Need Drugs" is kind of an eye-catching subject line and not one
that I would recommend.)  In any case, I suspect that if she had posted
needing medication for epilepsy or diabetes, you wouldn't have given her the
old bootstrap rigamarole.

Yeah, that's what I like about it, people say it's all in their head.  which 
is completely true.  something in their head is f'ed up.  Although that's the 
same thing with epilepsy too, but since that's something that you can see the 
symptoms a little more then someone with a different mental condition.  but 
yeah, ditto on the "Need drugs" subject line not being good :)

speaking of ephedra, I still use in as a supplement, yet my bottle is beginning to run out. A friend went to canada last weekend and I asked her to grab some there, but apparently they outlawed it there too. So now I am left surfing the web endlessly trying to find a supplier. Anyone know a source?

Claratin was only made legal over-the-counter a couple years ago. Before
that, I used to get "black market" Claratin off the lady who did my nails.
I've been a law-breaker for quite some time.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Thanks

I'd like to thank all the kind folks who offered me their various
medications. One kind soul was able to supply me with a month's worth of
the drug (in the exact dose) that I've been taking, and I know everyone in
my household is grateful.

By posting to the list, I knew half of you would bitch and moan and the
other half would be kind and helpful. I love this list.

Have a wonderful day. =)

Amanda

Kelly's right. The thing about Starscape is that it's an expression of the
keenest planning skills we'll probably ever see stateside. Lonnie is just a
genius. The event itself, the ambience of it, is the real draw. The sun
rising over the Chesapeake, the whole thing is an encapsulated nugget of

To go along with this point - the reason a lot of these drugs aren't 
over-the-counter, is more because of patent(i might be using the wrong 
word here - but i think that's it...) reasons than safety reasons. 
That's why Claritin and Alavert and all the rest are available now 
without prescriptions...

why is that? its not like taking antidepressants is fun, ive done 
it. the shit for seizures is much better for recreational use i 
bet. my dog takes phenobarbitol, which is much better than zoloft 
or whatever. what if someone was like "hey, i have a scrip for 
morphine, but im running out. anyone got any?". thats a physical 
ailment, not a mental one, and i think everyone would jump up and 
down for that as well. your point is poor. 

next

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR: need drugs

Where I werk, the whole list would be off-topic.  We don't even get to bring
in radios, with or without headphones.  Personal email, well maybe a single
one now and then is OK.  Being on a busy list and having time to read it
could get you dismissed.

in all honestly, posting something called "need drugs" on a public

have to worry about some annoying cocksucker from my job sniffing
for bad emails while im at work, but i understand that other
people do. though this cutting up is getting pretty fun.

I noticed ephedra being sold in pretty much every off road gas station that 
is not affiliated with a large corporation.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} free medications  (was medications)

Its funny you should mention that.  If your short on money you can go to any 
local out reach program, like townhall 2, and ask for assistance.  I worked 
in a pharmacy for six years and it seemed like these programs were pretty 
generous with the money they gave out.

And to think, after 9/11, I kept reading everywhere that "irony was dead."
Ha!

No, actually, there is no irony here. I used to have a job and steading
income, and now I don't. Quite simple indeed. I went down a couple whole
social classes from upper-middle class to broke ass ho. Not only can I not
afford the medicine, but I REALLY can't afford the doctor's visit that has
to come before it gets re-prescribed to me (since I ran out of refills).
My new job starts when I pass my Series 7 exam, so I've got at least one
full month of studying to do before I see any money whatsoever. There's a
light at the end of the tunnel, but the tunnel itself has been long,
murky, and humbling.

This all has been taken care of now, though, since I got a bunch of
Effexors yesterday.

Subject: {pb-cle} Goodbye from Ben

Well, I've been down in Florida for close to a week now, and the local
attitude seems to be seeping in. I am two blocks from the beach, 0.5 miles
from a PGA golf course, and wear shorts & flipflops to my I.T. job.

I guess my fascination with the drama playing out between music fans 900
miles away is dwindling. Anyone coming down this way, or wanting to hit me
up, can drop an email or bling me on AIM at: pangea33

Enjoy the drama!! I am sure I'll miss some of it eventually.

Thanks for the memories,
Ben

what a shock they'll have a new system in december and can give the 
report then.  I'm sure it's just coincidence that's after the 
elections.  How are they going to copy all the data over to the new 
system though?  just moving everything to a new system will cause the

     Holy fucking high horse batman.  I think its her choice what she puts in her e-mails.  If you see an e-mail that says need drugs and you find that offensive, heres a great idea, dont read the fucking thing.  And since when did become illegal to ask for drugs.  Last time I checked it was only illegal to buy or provide them.  I have been with out insurance and know what she is going through.  I'm not saying she went about solving her problem in the best way, but when your desperate your desperate.  Plus stopping that sort of medication is not only bad for you mentaly it could in some cases make you sick or even kill you.  So what I think everyone needs to do here is stop kicking her when shes down, step back and go fuck them selves.  She may have not gone about it in the best way, but who the hell are you or anybody else  to give her shit about it.
 
Peace

My take on the whole thing.

Amerikka has the FDA. They schedule drugs for over the counter or 
prescription and then classify the prescription drugs. If it's a 
prescription drug, get the prescription, if you need it bad 
enough, you will find a way to afford it. Asking on a public list 
for someone to break the law and provide you with medication is 
not a valid request. It's illegal. We all pee in our own pools, 
and we have to deal with that. Having no prescription insurance 
is not a reason to ask for someone to break the law and provide 
you with the medication you need. Call a congressman or your 
president and talk about health care for all citizens so that your 
children (or other people's children) will have something in place 
that is less corrupt than the current situation. Sell your 
computer on ebay. Donate plasma for money. Work a 2nd job 
washing dishes. 

On a somewhat related note, I'd like to thank the pharmaceutical 
companies for raising their prices to help offset the price of the 
free lunches I get all the time from the drug reps. And let's not 
forget the happy hours and top shelf martinis.

i'd double check, they are "ephedra free" formulas of old ephedra 
capsules (stackers, yellow jackets, et al.). these are basically 
caffeine pills with some other crap in em.  worthless junk.

Is that supposed to be some silly rip on my screen name? And your use of all capital letters proves my point of how everyone is blowing one persons silly mistake way out proportion.  IF YOU THINK IT MIGHT PISS YOU OFF DONT FUCKING READ IT! does that spell it out any better?        And that is Mr. to you.
 
P.S. Why dont you and all the other cops get together and start a petition to get anyone that talks about drugs ever (even by mistake) kicked of the list.  Then all of you cant sit around and rub each others balls about it.
