Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Interesting:

the-key.mod	1996-Jun-11 09:25:30	406.5K	audio/mod

Appears to be a complete remake of the Urban Cookie Collective song from '93...

I think this is the first time I've ever seen a .mod rebuild of an
existing song....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Boten Anna

I came into the whole internets thing /just/ after all this.  I  
called into a few BBS's but nothing too big, and accessed most  
through telnet so parent's wouldn't complain about phone bills :).  I  
still have an email I printed out back in '94 from AOL support  
because I couldn't understand ":)" became a smiley.  Ah, those were  
the days...

I went to lan parties for a while back in 2000 or so.  It's actually  
how I got intro'd into raves.  Before that I just thought this music  
"sounded cool" without know wtf it was.  I think one of the first  
artists I was like "that sounds cool" but had no idea who it was  
dune, of all groups.  Remember listening to "i can't stop raving" and  
be wondering wtf is raving :)  I was so clueless back in the day...  
unlike now of course... umm... yeah...

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Nov 18                       ASSDRAGON 4                     Pittsburgh

An epic laptop music battle where the winner gets a 7" record release on
No Room For Talent Records

Free to enter! Not a damn thing to lose!

Once again, the time has come for all electronic musicians in this 
forsaken wasteland to gather on the field of battle to prove their 
worth. Blood will spill and valor will be tested, but in the end, one 
champion will rise through the human wreckage and claim the spoils of 
war.

This competition is free to enter and anyone can join. All you need is 
courage...and a computer.

The Rules
This battle is being waged to see which electronic musician can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. You can only use a laptop or desktop 
computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no traditional 
instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug into the RCA 
input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount of material 
ahead of time and use any software you want, although you are encouraged 
to improvise or create material on the fly. Using material from other 
artists is grounds for removal: this rule is potentially misleading 
since you can use samples. Like the Galactic Ass Dragon Classics before 
it, this is not a Traktor battle: make your own shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many people enter, everyone 
who enters gets a 10 minute time slot in the opening round. There will 
be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, you can start 
setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in front of you is 
done, you're on the clock. Tick tock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 will 
move on to the semi-final round where they will have another 10 minutes 
to flay their competitors. At the completion of the semi-round, the top 
2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 minute shot before one 
glorious winner is crowned. The winner receives the highly coveted 
Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their own 7" record release on No 
Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the legendary No Room for Talent 
Records, Dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.

Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you made people get 
up, holler, and/or pump their fists. Getting the crowd to just gently 
bob their heads or feel your "soulful groove" is not only lame, it isn't 
worth any points. Breakcore, hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise 
are what's called for. Playing well-produced techno, drum and bass, 
trance, house, or downtempo idm will result in zero points and possibly 
the bum's rush. While vocals are not prohibited, may Odin have mercy on 
your soul if you dare to assault us with pitiful singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. Get naked. Do a skit. Anything. The more you distract 
everyone from your awful music, the more points you get. If you look 
like you're checking your email during your lunch break at work, you're 
going to do terrible.

This will be taking place at ON Gallery [5005 Penn Avenue] in Pittsburgh 
PA at 7PM. This event is ALL AGES! $3 cover: everyone who enters the 
competition gets in for free, so if you want to skirt the cover charge, 
contact Dave 8cylinder to lay down the guantlet.

Sat Nov 25                  OLD SCHOOL CURRICULUM                   crAkron

The Euphorix alumni are returning to bring you a specially-themed night 
of old school curriculum.

This eight hour function will cover the basic fundamentals of sound
design as well as it's most prestigous principles; during the course of
the seminar, various audio exhibitions ranging from the avant garde to
more traditional procedures will be fully exhibited via a proficient
arrangement designed for maximum impact. Be sure to secure your
attendence at this special engagement, sure to be a reference point for
further congregations to come!

COURSE INSTRUCTORS :

DANNY the WILDCHILD
( Advanced Drum & Bass Studies )
Mr. Wildchild is considered one of Chicago's most authoritive professors 
in the art of wreckin' shop; scores of pupils who have witnessed his 
one-of-a kind demonstrations behind the Techs can attest to the fact 
that Danny will, indeed, destroy the dancefloor in an authoritive 
fashion. Come welcome Mr. Wildchild back to one of his most appreciative 
classrooms: the Northeast Ohio Congregation.

NOX and DESIDERIO
( Advance House Comp. )
Combining years of acummulated experience in countless labs for what 
will surely be a successful experiment, these veteran mixologists will 
provide all engineers with a dynamic course designed to highlight their 
optimally strategized components...but please be advised that the 
elements involved in their procedure are highly flammable!

MIKE LOVE
( Intermediate House )
One of the region's most endeared gurus of house, Instructor Love will 
be present to infuse
4/4 selections of the utmost degree; expect distinguished arrangements 
that've long since been inducted!

DAMIAN LAUDERBACH
( Intermediate Ragga Jungle )
This mentor has ventured as far as the Pacific coast in his quest for 
the highest revered of Rastafarian breakbeats and his presentation is 
much more than a preface to the pinnacle of the evening's feature 
seminar; it's a reason to GET YOUR ASS THERE EARLY!!! A mandatory 
prerequisite to one-on-one encounters with the one like Jah highest.

DJ LEASH
( Intro to Happy Hardcore )
For this session only, recess will be granted for one hour! Postpone 
your current studies and get on the playground as soon as this 
ringleader gets the ball in his court. He's takin it back to the basics 
with a stellar assortment of jubilant vibes... no studying required!

Y2KID!!
( Abstract Art )
The premiere demonstration of the festivities will be conducted by 
utilizing various principles of proven formulas; and although this 
maestro's creative works range widely in definition, a generally 
conventional approach will be applied for optimum reception... you are

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Just when you thought it was safe...

"UnSilent Film" celebrates its Second Anniversary with a showing of "Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" on Monday, October 30th at The Hi-Fi Concert Club 
at 8pm.

The 1920 classic silent horror film (directed by John S. Robertson), is
based on the famous story by Robert Louis Stevenson. Starring John
Barrymore (grandfather of actress Drew Barrymore) who chews up the
scenery in the dual role as the conflicted Dr. Henry Jekyll/Mr. Edward
Hyde.

This version received high marks when it was released -- Variety
proclaimed it "a fine dignified presentation... the appearance of John
Barrymore in any production is an event and there remains for the
reviewer only to comment on how excellent is his portrayal of the dual
personalities of the unfortunate Dr. Jekyll." The New York Times agreed:
"something special and extraordinary... in Mr. Barrymore's flawless
performance."

Though many interpretations followed over the years, it is Barrymore's
portrayal (much like Max Schreck's in "Nosferatu") that stays lodged in
the dreams of the collective unconscious.

"UnSilent Film" -- a series of silent movies preformed with an
improvised live score -- will be performed this time by Thieves Like Me,
fluxmonkey, tofu, Shawn Holt, Geo Jones and Steven K. Smith.

The Hi-Fi Concert Club is located at 11729 Detroit Ave., Lakewood, OH
(216) 521-8878.

I used to be on BBSs all the time in the 80s, I definately remeber
programming Basic on the C64s.  I think we had a 200 or 300 baud modem or
something close.

Funny story:  I was with my bro and one of his friend decided it would be
fun to smash his X girlfriend's mailbox.  Well even though I was innocent I
got taken to the Police Station.  They kept trying to call our parents to
pick us up and I realized and kept trying to explain to the officers that m=
y
computer was on a BBS downloading and my parents would were clueless so it
would be a busy signal forever; they just looked at us like we were crazy,
talking gibberish.  Hey, we got a free ride home out of it ;)  Wow thats
dating myself.

I do remember "Purple Motion" demos kicked some ass, that was much later in
the 80s though.  I definately remember a bunch of them though cause you
always got them with the hacks: what the hell happened to hacker class.
Seems like it got reduced to minimalized to nfos and dumb installers.  All =
I
remember early on was a crap load of ASCII art, game downloads 10 down for
every 1 up, oh and lots of ASCII pR0n =96 damn keyboard sickies LOL
good times, good times

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Boten Anna

I work with a guy who's constantly saying the same thing, and at =20
least once a month he finds something about the "new Amiga" coming =20
out sometime around Duke Nukem Forever. They were never business =20
machines and were really artist and gaming oddities. They were =20
excellent, yes, I think BS can speak to something the physics or chem =20=

departments at pitt using them for modeling at one point or another. =20
I think he's got a basement full of them.

ANSI art that came with releases really kind of spawned its own =20
scene, sort of a cross between graffiti and surrealism computer art =20
something or other.

I went to high school with a guy was an artist for ACiD Crew, he's =20
spend months hand doing ANSI art. This was about 95, and the music, =20
art, and piracy had kind have gone to their own scenes.

I actually miss the days of things being so limiting that you really =20
had to push the way that art or music could be done. I think this is =20
why I'm picking up a Machinedrum-UW when I can sell off enough of the =20=

gear in my basement -- it's still a tracker really. As far as art go, =20=

there's a lot of pixel art floating around, but it's just not the =20
same. Nothing is really new as far as presentation goes, and when =20
something is new, it's something not pushed out of the underground, =20
but something commercial. No reason to really go hacking around =20
hardware anymore I guess.

Speaking of, I've got Lenny's old PA downstairs. It's got a few =20
upgrades and new SKB racks. Anyone interested let me know. Some =20
electribes, a microkorg, mixers, and god knows what else. I've got a =20
lot of cataloging to do.

My neighbors had the vic-20 with the cassete.  We had the disk drive and a
couple different models of the 64.  They are dead, yet I plan to make them
SIDs someday.

Oh yeah that was Future Crew I was thinking of with the demos - they
rocked.  I guess that was some of my first exposure to electronic music.  I
always did think of it as futureistic stuff.

>Was anyone here in the Spectrum ZX scene?

No, but I built a zx80 and bought a zx81, left that scene when I built
my h89 and later got a c=64. Great machines though... Never got a
spectrum cause I was back in the US by the time they came out, and
Atari 800s and C=64 owned the cheap home hacker market here. I drueled
over an Atari ST for years but when I finally got the cash to buy
something that size I figured I'd better get one of those new pc
'clones', because I wanted to learn how to program in C and program
the new microsoft windows 1.03... yech! Glad I did though, it's payed
off so many times over the years.

New hardware is really boring though... best thing that's closest to
it is the homebrew scene for handheld gaming devices. Lotta fun left
in those. J2ME is really fun on phones too. Also buying some handheld
device and hacking up a Windows CE platform for it is hella fun. there
are alot of cheap programmable processors around that you can get
started hacking for about $50... Theres fun to be had, just not much
on the desktop connected to a monitor.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Inject cover art into id3 tags?

Hey everyone.

I have an ever growing mp3 collection (200gb or so at last count) and 
I recently picked up one of those swell video Ipods where it shows 
the cover art and none of my mp3s have art in them.  I noticed that 
alot of my mp3s have the cover art stored in folder.jpg files in the 
directories on a per-album basis.

I've been doing alot of id3tag cleaning in my spare time and haven't 
found a nice way to automatically insert the folder.jpg cover art 
into the files in the directory that contains it.  I've found alot of 
programs that will go online and look for the art for you, but i 
don't want that, because #1, i already have the art in most cases, 
and #2 its unlikely that the rare vinyl rips I have from 1993 where 
some guy just shot a picture of the center of the record itself will 
be at amazon.com!

Any ideas?  Remember, i'm not going to listen to each track just to 
insert the art (I may have more hours of music than I have life 
expectancy at this point anyway)  I have a windows box so you linux 
freaks and mac dorks don't tell me how you can do it on your machine, 
unless you live in pittsburgh and are willing to go through my 
collection and do it for me. :P

Long winded as usual

I still have a "laptop" somewhere that you programmed in basic and  
saved things to micro cassette.  And it came with a cash register  
type printer.  Had fun with that.

I remember when my brother (we were always in competition for  
computer stuff) got a 1 gig drive and I was amazed, how could someone  
ever use 1gig of storage space.  Now there are games that are 4 gigs.

It's a series of tubes!!!  I still remember playing quake 1 on the  
internets with a blazing fast 28.8k modem (my first modem was a  
"blazing fast" 14.4k modem) and lag was pretty much under control  
unlike now where you have games that require broadband connections.

Def not the easiest way.  But go to that album in itunes and open the  
folder it's in with the image.  Select all the items in iTunes that  
you want to have that picture set to.  Then just drag the file of the  
image to the album art spot in the lower left corner and it will  
apply it to all the selected items.  If you have a lot of albums it  
may not be too bad, if they are a bunch of single songs, then you're  
screwed.

we're looking at thousands of albums, since most are vinyl rips they 
only have a few tracks on them.  Not worth doing in itunes.  Plus, I 
don't think itunes saves the picture in the actual mp3 file.

Nope it saves it in the file.  Traaaat has sent me some mixes and he  
added album art and it's included in the file.  It's the same reason  
that when you download podcasts they have album art usually.  But  
yeah, it would take a while for 1,000's of albums.  So I fall back on  
option 2... you're screwed.

sounds like a project without an obvious automated solution, but i think
depending on some questions it could be done....

are your mp3's at least already in folders?

do the folders have the pictures of the album anywhere in any standard
naming convention?

will you buy me a belgian beer if i help write you something to do this for
you?

if you can answer these 3 questions to my satisfaction, then i'll give it my
best effort :)

http://www.goodvibesentertainment.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=29

I may just have to make an animated GIF which alternates between the two.

Yep. I had a TRS80 Color Computer when I was a kid that stored
everything on tapes. It was a lot cooler to save them to tape than to
have to retype every program every time you turned the thing on. One of
the wires going into the recorder was some kind of control signal that
would turn it off and on, but it eventually got a short, but strangely
the thing just kept working without it. I can distinctly remember the
tones it produced at the start of a tape - modem-like, but not
exactly...

I started off on a TRS80 too.  mine had a 9 pin DIN style connector that
went to an 1/8" mini jack on the cassette.  you had to do the

LOAD "WHATEVER.BAS" and then hit enter then press play.

Knock on wood, i dont remember having much problems with getting things to
load and save properly.  I did use a new tape for every program though...
and used the BASF CrO2 tapes, that were much better than the standard at
that time.

First computer was a ZX when I was like 7.  I used to make silly maze games
and stuff in BASIC.

I got into the NTSC C-64 demo scene from 89-92.  My group and I released
around 15 demos, not including intros for the warez/import groups.  We did a
diskmag too.  Fun times.

Demo programming on the C-64 is crazy, everything runs off a raster interrupt
and all the coolest effects are done by glitching (sort of) the VIC chip.
Sometimes you'd have to unroll loops to save rastertime (and the unrolled loop
would take up most of the C-64's memory).  And theres no floating point or
even multiply/divide in 6502 asm.

If you really want to learn how to optimize code, try coding a demo on one of
these old machines.. It will teach you more about software design than years
of C or Java or whatever experience.

Subject: {pb-cle} bounce 2 review

snipped from mah bloggie blog

saturday we went to pixburgh for bounce 2. after climbing NINE FLIGHTS 
OF STAIRS we made it up to the spot, the stairs wouldnt have been so 
bad, but i had a crate of records. derrr....... anyhow i spun an early 
slot, not one of my better ones skillwise, but i dug out some older gems 
that kids really got into. got many compliments later on which is really 
cool, since i was on pretty early and the crowd hadn't filled in yet. 
erin and squirelly played psy which seemed to go over very well and was 
a very welcome change IMO. i hope those 2 get more bookings. venom i 
kinda tuned out and was elsewhere :) last few tracks of his set were 
okay but meh. paladin 5.1 was a huge letdown, i really didnt dig it and 
alot of the crowd lost interest after the novelty of the suit wore off. 
i guess if you're gonna wear costumes, do it right. take a note from 
gwar, they're still a riot after like forever. mikey killed it, that 
seems to be what most of the kids were there for, they went absolutely 
batshit bezerk. i missed most of tikas set coz i was elsewhere :) we 
stuck around a little longer and headed over to dan and AK's place for a 
very very chill afterhours, i think after raving so hard these kids 
actually wore themselves out. i lounged about and chilled a bit myself. 
headed home and squeezed in a couple hours of sleep, and resembled a 
human at work. yow!

anyhow pictures are up at http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/2006-11-04-bounce2

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Anyone have pc133 ram sitting around?

A friend of mine is trying to run win xp pro and photoshop (eek!) on 
a computer with 128mb of ram.  She's VERY patient but patience can 
only go so far.

Does anyone have any pc133 (or pc100 would probably work too, i'd 
have to try it) ram sitting around that they'd like to donate or sell 
very cheaply to the cause?  I'm not sure how much her machine can 
handle (its an old dell with a celeron in it), but its got 2x 64mb 
sticks in it now and anything has to be better than that.

Its funny how hard the stuff is to find nowadays.

Jaded? Who's jaded?

Rumsfeld quitting as defense secretary

Adjust font size:
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush announced Wednesday that Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is stepping down from his post.

"The timing is right for new leadership at the Pentagon," Bush said at the
White House Wednesday afternoon.

Rumsfeld has been heavily criticized for his policies in Iraq, and exit
polls taken during Tuesday's midterm election, seen by some as a referendum
on Bush and his administration, showed strong voter dissatisfaction -- 57
percent -- with the Iraq war.

"I recognize that many Americans voted last night to register their
displeasure with the lack of progress being made" in Iraq, Bush said. (Bush
discusses Rumsfeld's resignation -- 1:27)

Bush said he had "a series of thoughtful conversations" with Rumsfeld about
the defense secretary's resignation.

Former CIA chief Robert Gates, who headed that agency from 1991 until 1993,
will be nominated to take over as defense secretary, Bush said Wednesday.

Gates is now president of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas.

Rumsfeld, 74, has served as defense secretary since January 20, 2001, the
beginning of Bush's first term.

He also served as defense secretary under President Ford from 1975 to 1977.

"Don Rumsfeld has been a superb leader during a time of change," Bush said
Wednesday. "Yet he also appreciates the value of bringing in a fresh
perspective during a critical period in this war."

With the change, Bush pledged to stand by the people of Iraq.

"Do not be fearful," Bush said in reference to Iraqis. "As you take the
difficult steps toward democracy and peace, America's going to stand with
you. We know you want a better way of life, and now is the time to seize
it."

Bush also expressed support for U.S. military personnel.

"Don't be doubtful. America will always support you," the president said.
"Our nation is blessed to have men and women who volunteer to serve and are
willing to risk their own lives for the safety of our fellow citizens."

Pressure mounted on Rumsfeld
Rumsfeld has been under increasing pressure as U.S. casualties mount in
Iraq.

Monday an editorial in Military Times Publications -- which includes the
Army Times, Navy Times, Air Force Times and Marine Corps Times -- called fo=
r
him to step down. The publications are independent of the Department of
Defense. (Watch why Army Times declared 'Rumsfeld must go' -- 1:49)

October was the fourth-deadliest month for U.S. troops since the 2003
invasion, with 105 Americans killed.

As the war in Iraq dragged on, Rumsfeld became a lightning rod for critics
of the war, with many accusing him of failing to send enough U.S. troops to
Iraq or plan for the country's occupation and reconstruction.

His public approval rating sagged as the war became more unpopular.
Fifty-two percent of those surveyed in a CNN poll in early October said the=
y
believed Bush should fire Rumsfeld; only 33 percent said no.

A recent book by journalist Bob Woodward states that former White House
Chief of Staff Andrew Card tried to persuade Bush to fire the defense
secretary, a fact a senior White House official confirmed to CNN last week.

The sometimes-prickly defense chief also has had his detractors in Congress=
,
including many Democrats and some fellow Republicans, including Sen. Mike
DeWine, who lost his seat in a tight Ohio race on Tuesday.

Earlier this year, eight retired generals, including former NATO commander
Wesley Clark and the former head of the U.S. Central Command Anthony Zinni,
called for Rumsfeld's resignation. They accused him of mishandling the Iraq
war and failing to do post-planning.

Bush said while Rumsfeld's resignation had been in the works for a period o=
f
time he held off any announcement until Wednesday because he "didn't want t=
o
inject a major decision about this war in the final days" of the election
campaign.

Move gains Democrats' support
Democrats on Wednesday expressed support for new leadership at the Pentagon=
.

"I welcome this change. I think it will give a fresh start to finding a
solution to Iraq rather than staying the course," said Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-California, who is poised to become House speaker after Democrats won
control of that chamber on Tuesday.

"I recognize that the country's going to be well-served with a new secretar=
y
of defense. I look forward to working with that person," said Sen. Harry
Reid, D-Nevada, the Senate minority leader.

"But also, I look forward to working with the president to see if the new
secretary of defense will help work to change course in Iraq. We have to do
that," Reid said.

"Yesterday's election was a cry for change, and for the first time it looks
like the president is listening," said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York.

"The nomination of a new Department of Defense secretary is a good first
step, and we hope it is a sign that the president is looking toward a new
course of action in Iraq. We look forward to working with him on an Iraq
policy that is both strong and smart," Schumer said.

it's too bad the election is over because we will no longer have

would it actually be an album, or more like a single?  a very long 
boring single?

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Nov 18                       ASSDRAGON 4                     Pittsburgh

An epic laptop music battle where the winner gets a 7" record release on
No Room For Talent Records

Free to enter! Not a damn thing to lose!

Once again, the time has come for all electronic musicians in this 
forsaken wasteland to gather on the field of battle to prove their 
worth. Blood will spill and valor will be tested, but in the end, one 
champion will rise through the human wreckage and claim the spoils of 
war.

This competition is free to enter and anyone can join. All you need is 
courage...and a computer.

The Rules
This battle is being waged to see which electronic musician can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. You can only use a laptop or desktop 
computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no traditional 
instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug into the RCA 
input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount of material 
ahead of time and use any software you want, although you are encouraged 
to improvise or create material on the fly. Using material from other 
artists is grounds for removal: this rule is potentially misleading 
since you can use samples. Like the Galactic Ass Dragon Classics before 
it, this is not a Traktor battle: make your own shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many people enter, everyone 
who enters gets a 10 minute time slot in the opening round. There will 
be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, you can start 
setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in front of you is 
done, you're on the clock. Tick tock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 will 
move on to the semi-final round where they will have another 10 minutes 
to flay their competitors. At the completion of the semi-round, the top 
2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 minute shot before one 
glorious winner is crowned. The winner receives the highly coveted 
Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their own 7" record release on No 
Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the legendary No Room for Talent 
Records, Dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.

Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you made people get 
up, holler, and/or pump their fists. Getting the crowd to just gently 
bob their heads or feel your "soulful groove" is not only lame, it isn't 
worth any points. Breakcore, hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise 
are what's called for. Playing well-produced techno, drum and bass, 
trance, house, or downtempo idm will result in zero points and possibly 
the bum's rush. While vocals are not prohibited, may Odin have mercy on 
your soul if you dare to assault us with pitiful singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. Get naked. Do a skit. Anything. The more you distract 
everyone from your awful music, the more points you get. If you look 
like you're checking your email during your lunch break at work, you're 
going to do terrible.

This will be taking place at ON Gallery [5005 Penn Avenue] in Pittsburgh 
PA at 7PM. This event is ALL AGES! $3 cover: everyone who enters the 
competition gets in for free, so if you want to skirt the cover charge, 
contact Dave 8cylinder to lay down the guantlet.

Featuring Sets by

Punisher

( Seismic, Matrix, Uppercut ) Detroit  MI

PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER

Known in circles of Detroit and around the globe for her ambition and 
skills on the tables, Michelle Herrmann a.k.a. Punisher has set a 
precedence in a city known for it's fickle taste. Her Birth into the 
techno realm began in Detroit in 1993 at the age of 15 . DJ'ing wasn't 
enough, Michelle was constantly striving to grow and progress in her 
art. 1996 and 1997 she put out her first two releases on Detroit label 
Matrix records and then in 1998 , started her own label , Seismic 
Records with a friend and fellow producer Mike Brickner a.k.a. Cozmic 
Spore. Using the label as a tool push their own concepts of sound and 
motion they have in turn worked with and gained the respect of many 
world renowned DJs and producers. With releases from the Advent and 
Bryan Zentz and Andrei Morant , collaborations with legendary producer 
Mark Gage ( Vapourspace ), and liscensing from Dave Clarke and Billy 
Nasty .. to name a few, Seismic is developing into a strong Domestic 
force. Now on it's 20th release Seismic Records has become a unique tool 
that allows Punisher to continue moving in a new direction with her 
sound. She has brought over the synthy yet percussive styles of the 
Swedish / German techno producers and drawn upon her own Detroit roots 
for inspiration. To back the momentum of the Techno releases she travels 
the world DJing and performing LIVE P.A.'s as much as possible . Banging 
out amazing sets 100% of the time , her current sound has more 
dancefloor friendly roots, one's that your club or event is sure to 
appreciate. From Drum N' Bass, Techno, Electro and everything in 
between, she has repeatedly played throughout the US , Canada , Europe 
and Puerto Rico and has headlined large scale Famous events and clubs 
all around the World with . Joel Mull, Cari Lekebusch, Marco Carola, Ben 
Sims, Jay Denham, Misstress Barbara, Richie Hawtin, Dave Clarke, Derrick 
May, T-1000, Gaetano Parisio and many others. Michelle's music has also 
landed her a spot as guest DJ several radio stations including Satellite 
"XM RADIO" which signed a deal with Detroit's Motor giant GM for 
placement of it's radio in all new vehicles off the assembly line. On 
top of her game would be an understatement for Punisher, as her 
accomplishments are only a small portion of what she has planned for 
2005 and beyond.. Including a huge onslaught of releases lined up to 
come out and her First ever full length Album !!

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Just when you thought it was safe...

"UnSilent Film" celebrates its Second Anniversary with a showing of "Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" on Monday, October 30th at The Hi-Fi Concert Club 
at 8pm.

The 1920 classic silent horror film (directed by John S. Robertson), is
based on the famous story by Robert Louis Stevenson. Starring John
Barrymore (grandfather of actress Drew Barrymore) who chews up the
scenery in the dual role as the conflicted Dr. Henry Jekyll/Mr. Edward
Hyde.

This version received high marks when it was released -- Variety
proclaimed it "a fine dignified presentation... the appearance of John
Barrymore in any production is an event and there remains for the
reviewer only to comment on how excellent is his portrayal of the dual
personalities of the unfortunate Dr. Jekyll." The New York Times agreed:
"something special and extraordinary... in Mr. Barrymore's flawless
performance."

Though many interpretations followed over the years, it is Barrymore's
portrayal (much like Max Schreck's in "Nosferatu") that stays lodged in
the dreams of the collective unconscious.

"UnSilent Film" -- a series of silent movies preformed with an
improvised live score -- will be performed this time by Thieves Like Me,
fluxmonkey, tofu, Shawn Holt, Geo Jones and Steven K. Smith.

The Hi-Fi Concert Club is located at 11729 Detroit Ave., Lakewood, OH
(216) 521-8878.

nah, i get all that.

just sayin...if one were to take that the wrong way, it wouldn't be
hard to raise a fuss.

and pittsburghers make fun of pittsburgh, too.

the way i look at it is, if you don't have a sense of humor about
yourself and your surroundings, you become...a terrorist or a
republican.

You're right - I wouldn't go.

This also keeps me away from the rest of the shit Cleveland is doing. 
Wanna ask me why?..

This is just an example.

Living outside of the area, I don't hear much in the way of news.  But
two CMU kids apparently were breaking and entering into Heinz Field,
and got $1 MILLION dollar bail set.  Pittsburgh police treated it as a
terrorist incident??

Being their last names are Durvasula and Sudeep, I'm guessing they're
getting hosed for being foreigners?

My bail was a million dollars when I got busted.

Then it got lowered to 10K after arraignment, and we got it down to 3500  
after a bail hearing.


Bails can be ridiculously high before arraignment.

They're pretty much one and the same from the point of view of many of

Hey, I was looking at the website, and it says under dress code that
T-shirts, tennis shoes, and baggy jeans are not permitted... That's
basically what I like to wear when I'm trying to bust a move. Do you
know if they enforce this crap during events such as this?

Dan,

That dress-code doesn't apply to our events; the worst that I have seen 
happen is they may ask you to take your hat off upon entry, but just throw 
it back on once you're in there and there won't be an issue.

T-shirts & baggy jeans are more than permitted!

Paul

What a horrible night to have a curse.

I went to highschool with three kids that were in an incident at Jacob 
Field. 2 Just won the case with a million dollars each, while the other 
was sent to jail for 3  years..

All of them are douche bags though.

classic!

i just got their box set "and what have you done with my body, god?"

it's 2 discs of essentially the same outtakes over and over, and a
third disc with live versions of the same songs.

not worth the money. glad i didn't pay full price.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Nov 18                       ASSDRAGON 4                     Pittsburgh

An epic laptop music battle where the winner gets a 7" record release on
No Room For Talent Records

Free to enter! Not a damn thing to lose!

Once again, the time has come for all electronic musicians in this 
forsaken wasteland to gather on the field of battle to prove their 
worth. Blood will spill and valor will be tested, but in the end, one 
champion will rise through the human wreckage and claim the spoils of 
war.

This competition is free to enter and anyone can join. All you need is 
courage...and a computer.

The Rules
This battle is being waged to see which electronic musician can bring 
the crowd to a fevered frenzy. You can only use a laptop or desktop 
computer. No gear, no turntables, no cd mixers, and no traditional 
instruments are permitted. You just need to be able to plug into the RCA 
input jacks on a standard mixer. You may prepare any amount of material 
ahead of time and use any software you want, although you are encouraged 
to improvise or create material on the fly. Using material from other 
artists is grounds for removal: this rule is potentially misleading 
since you can use samples. Like the Galactic Ass Dragon Classics before 
it, this is not a Traktor battle: make your own shit.

This battle is divided into 3 rounds: the opening round, the semi-final 
round, and the final round. No matter how many people enter, everyone 
who enters gets a 10 minute time slot in the opening round. There will 
be 2 tables setup: while the person before you is playing, you can start 
setting up on the free table. As soon as the person in front of you is 
done, you're on the clock. Tick tock.

At the end of the opening round, the judges will vote and the top 4 will 
move on to the semi-final round where they will have another 10 minutes 
to flay their competitors. At the completion of the semi-round, the top 
2 move on to the final round and get a final 10 minute shot before one 
glorious winner is crowned. The winner receives the highly coveted 
Galactic Ass Dragon Classic trophy and their own 7" record release on No 
Room for Talent Records.

Although there is no rule prohibiting you from playing the same music 
each round, that is pretty damn boring, so you're encouraged to play 
different material each round.

There will be 3 judges: Greg Trash from the legendary No Room for Talent 
Records, Dave 8cylinder from Pittsburgh's Thac0 Records, and a mystery 
judge who will be unveiled at the time of the event. All judges' 
decisions are final.

Everyone who enters will be judged using the following criteria:

- DESTRUCTIVENESS: This is determined by how well you made people get 
up, holler, and/or pump their fists. Getting the crowd to just gently 
bob their heads or feel your "soulful groove" is not only lame, it isn't 
worth any points. Breakcore, hardcore, speedcore, and aggressive noise 
are what's called for. Playing well-produced techno, drum and bass, 
trance, house, or downtempo idm will result in zero points and possibly 
the bum's rush. While vocals are not prohibited, may Odin have mercy on 
your soul if you dare to assault us with pitiful singing.

- ORIGINALITY/CREATIVITY: This is a measure of how well your shitty 
music stood out from the other shitty music.

- PRESENTATION: Everyone has to look at you while you're playing, so do 
something. Get naked. Do a skit. Anything. The more you distract 
everyone from your awful music, the more points you get. If you look 
like you're checking your email during your lunch break at work, you're 
going to do terrible.

This will be taking place at ON Gallery [5005 Penn Avenue] in Pittsburgh 
PA at 7PM. This event is ALL AGES! $3 cover: everyone who enters the 
competition gets in for free, so if you want to skirt the cover charge, 
contact Dave 8cylinder to lay down the guantlet.

Ryan is adept in the late night hours, finding the balance between heavy 
floor tracks and elegant crowdpleasers. Utilizing three decks, multiple

Punisher

( Seismic, Matrix, Uppercut ) Detroit  MI

PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER

Known in circles of Detroit and around the globe for her ambition and 
skills on the tables, Michelle Herrmann a.k.a. Punisher has set a 
precedence in a city known for it's fickle taste. Her Birth into the 
techno realm began in Detroit in 1993 at the age of 15 . DJ'ing wasn't 
enough, Michelle was constantly striving to grow and progress in her 
art. 1996 and 1997 she put out her first two releases on Detroit label 
Matrix records and then in 1998 , started her own label , Seismic 
Records with a friend and fellow producer Mike Brickner a.k.a. Cozmic 
Spore. Using the label as a tool push their own concepts of sound and 
motion they have in turn worked with and gained the respect of many 
world renowned DJs and producers. With releases from the Advent and 
Bryan Zentz and Andrei Morant , collaborations with legendary producer 
Mark Gage ( Vapourspace ), and liscensing from Dave Clarke and Billy 
Nasty .. to name a few, Seismic is developing into a strong Domestic 
force. Now on it's 20th release Seismic Records has become a unique tool 
that allows Punisher to continue moving in a new direction with her 
sound. She has brought over the synthy yet percussive styles of the 
Swedish / German techno producers and drawn upon her own Detroit roots 
for inspiration. To back the momentum of the Techno releases she travels 
the world DJing and performing LIVE P.A.'s as much as possible . Banging 
out amazing sets 100% of the time , her current sound has more 
dancefloor friendly roots, one's that your club or event is sure to 
appreciate. From Drum N' Bass, Techno, Electro and everything in 
between, she has repeatedly played throughout the US , Canada , Europe 
and Puerto Rico and has headlined large scale Famous events and clubs 
all around the World with . Joel Mull, Cari Lekebusch, Marco Carola, Ben 
Sims, Jay Denham, Misstress Barbara, Richie Hawtin, Dave Clarke, Derrick 
May, T-1000, Gaetano Parisio and many others. Michelle's music has also 
landed her a spot as guest DJ several radio stations including Satellite 
"XM RADIO" which signed a deal with Detroit's Motor giant GM for 
placement of it's radio in all new vehicles off the assembly line. On 
top of her game would be an understatement for Punisher, as her 
accomplishments are only a small portion of what she has planned for 
2005 and beyond.. Including a huge onslaught of releases lined up to 
come out and her First ever full length Album !!

All New Event! Sunday Nights at Spy Bar
All Electronic Music Party

Local DJs are bringing it back together for an all electronic music 
night every Sunday night, starting Dec. 4, at the Spy in Downtown 
Cleveland's Warehouse District. Explicit Productions (Old School, 
Columbus) has come out of hibernation and into Cleveland to produce a No 
Bullshit, scene supporting, killer club night at one of Clevelands best 
venues for a great sunday of bangin' beats.

We're bringing in some Fresh Blood with some hot new resident DJs. You 
might not have heard of them, but you Definitely need to hear them. 
Check out:
DJ Howse Mowse
DJ Jason Damman
DJ Spyral
Robert Van Helsing
These guys are talented, spin some great music, and are down with the 
program to bring together a killer club night without a fifteen dollar 
cover. Moonshine will have a $5.00 cover ($8.00 for ages 18-20). We will 
bring in guest DJs. We will bring in special acts. We will try our 
damndest to do it all without raising the cover charge.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Subject: 	Downtime Friday night for a colo move
Date: 	Thu, 16 Nov 2006 19:04:02 -0800 (PST)
From: 	Brian Behlendorf



On Friday night, starting at around 6:30pm, hyperreal.org is moving along 
with the other machines in the BurningMan rack to a new colo a few miles 
away.  It should only take a few hours to be moved, configured, and come 
back up.

find sweet ass with go-karts at the rave...

Scheduled Maintenance isn't included in most IT downtime reports, We  
only include that sides of the business that are telecom related.

Subject: {pb-cle} bring it back 3 review

my pictures - http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/2006-11-18-bringitback3
bills pictures - http://ravefuel.com/gallery/bringitback3

bring it back 3 was out in wellsville, the home of pete and pete? nah, 
doesn't look right.  anyhow.  no runins with the state police this time 
out there doing 90 in a 55 which is good i guess.  not that i think 
theres anything wrong w driving 90 in a 55, i mean sammy hagar cant 
drive 55 so why should i?  drove past the venue, but i saw it and told 
bill to turn around, but we didnt see a wellsville sign, i could swear i 
saw one last time.  oh well.

so we get there and there are like 4 carloads of people chillin and 
whatnot.  all at once everyone got out and had a huge line all of a 
sudden.  we beat them all in by a minute or so, so NO LINES yey.

turnout looked thin, then all at once, blammo, like a spanish 
inquisition the place was pretty full.  so it was pretty bumpin from the 
beginning which is good.  tika was on first, but ended up off in the 3rd 
room for psytrance for a bit.  then END, weird seeing a goodfella in the 
states :), ratana/kirby--crowd wasn't feeling it, bit mellow for the 
time IMO.  aphrodite, you can tell everyone was there for that.  place 
went apeshit.  everyone was in there, everywhere the halls were empty, 
noone seemed to be milling about, it was main room peak hour insanity. 
bill *gasp* enjoyed jungle.  ncoder was whining about jumpup, whatevah. 
shit was fun. no left turn the place was going bonkers for too.  
colin/naoko on after, i didnt think that would go over very well, and 
the crowd thinned out pretty quick.  shame, they dropped some good 
stuff.  nice to hear mills on a big system fershure.

in and out of the 3rd room thru the night, lots of psy in there, steady 
crowd thru the night. some ukhardhouse and hhc later on.

went to go leave and get like 4 cars organized to drive to my old alma 
mater yompton for a chill afterhours.  well it was typically 
disorganized as any raver caravan goes, but we find someone backed into 
a car, slid into aprilstars and pushed hers into another, so took quite 
awhile to get stuff straightened out and take off.  

chilled at liz's for a few hours, egged HR into drinking some special 
beer.  ride home was awesome.  that night at work wasn't.

anyhow all in all a really fun party, i really dig the venue and hope 
things keep up out there.

BTW i did take my pooh backpack out at erikas request/dare.  makes a 
good camera bag but gets annoying at times, so i dunno.

thanks to damien + crew for a kickass party

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

enough, Michelle was constantly striving to grow and progress in her 
art. 1996 and 1997 she put out her first two releases on Detroit label

world renowned DJs and producers. With releases from the Advent and 
Bryan Zentz and Andrei Morant , collaborations with legendary producer 
Mark Gage ( Vapourspace ), and liscensing from Dave Clarke and Billy 
Nasty .. to name a few, Seismic is developing into a strong Domestic 
force. Now on it's 20th release Seismic Records has become a unique tool 
that allows Punisher to continue moving in a new direction with her 
sound. She has brought over the synthy yet percussive styles of the 
Swedish / German techno producers and drawn upon her own Detroit roots 
for inspiration. To back the momentum of the Techno releases she travels 
the world DJing and performing LIVE P.A.'s as much as possible . Banging 
out amazing sets 100% of the time , her current sound has more 
dancefloor friendly roots, one's that your club or event is sure to

Entertainment
techno

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OC_bntzP7o

Detroit-born, Chicago-and-Berlin-based Alan D. Oldham has been called 
"Detroit Techno's Renaissance Man" (Muzik, UK). A lifelong cartoonist 
and graphic designer, a young Oldham published his own comic book 
"Johnny Gambit" in 1987 to local notoriety. Hired that same year by 
Derrick May to illustrate several memorable pieces for the new Transmat 
label, led to Oldham's first involvement in the fledgling techno scene. 
Under his alias DJ T-1000, he has rocked crowds in Berlin, Rome, Warsaw, 
Barcelona, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and all points in between with his own brand 
of funky-ass techno. When he's not behind the decks or producing music 
for labels like Tresor Berlin, Pure Sonik and xfive, he's an illustrator 
who has shown in galleries in Chicago, Paris and Los Angeles. Showcasing 
his own productions, this fearless operator truly encompasses all that 
is "Electronica", combining film music with New Wave melodies, monotone 
club anthems with Grunge-inflected guitar feedback. Oldham`s output has 
taken down the borders, combined the concepts and blended the elements 
into autobiographical narrative. A true legend.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

bring it back 3 was out in wellsville, the home of pete and pete? nah, 
doesn't look right. anyhow. no runins with the state police this time 
out there doing 90 in a 55 which is good i guess. not that i think 
theres anything wrong w driving 90 in a 55, i mean sammy hagar cant 
drive 55 so why should i? drove past the venue, but i saw it and told 
bill to turn around, but we didnt see a wellsville sign, i could swear i 
saw one last time. oh well.

so we get there and there are like 4 carloads of people chillin and 
whatnot. all at once everyone got out and had a huge line all of a 
sudden. we beat them all in by a minute or so, so NO LINES yey.

turnout looked thin, then all at once, blammo, like a spanish 
inquisition the place was pretty full. so it was pretty bumpin from the 
beginning which is good. tika was on first, but ended up off in the 3rd 
room for psytrance for a bit. then END, weird seeing a goodfella in the 
states :), ratana/kirby--crowd wasn't feeling it, bit mellow for the 
time IMO. aphrodite, you can tell everyone was there for that. place 
went apeshit. everyone was in there, everywhere the halls were empty, 
noone seemed to be milling about, it was main room peak hour insanity. 
bill *gasp* enjoyed jungle. ncoder was whining about jumpup, whatevah. 
shit was fun. no left turn the place was going bonkers for too. 
colin/naoko on after, i didnt think that would go over very well, and 
the crowd thinned out pretty quick. shame, they dropped some good 
stuff. nice to hear mills on a big system fershure.

in and out of the 3rd room thru the night, lots of psy in there, steady 
crowd thru the night. some ukhardhouse and hhc later on.

went to go leave and get like 4 cars organized to drive to my old alma 
mater yompton for a chill afterhours. well it was typically 
disorganized as any raver caravan goes, but we find someone backed into 
a car, slid into aprilstars and pushed hers into another, so took quite 
awhile to get stuff straightened out and take off. 

chilled at liz's for a few hours, egged HR into drinking some special 
beer. ride home was awesome. that night at work wasn't.

anyhow all in all a really fun party, i really dig the venue and hope 
things keep up out there.

BTW i did take my pooh backpack out at erikas request/dare. makes a 
good camera bag but gets annoying at times, so i dunno.

thanks to damien + crew for a kickass party

Next Meeting: 7:30pm, November 30, 2006

Kevin C. Smith is a musician and (bedroom) producer who also turns
obsolete toys and children's keyboards into unique musical
instruments through circuit bending. He will give an overview of
circuit bending including what to bend and basic techniques. He will
also present and demonstrate such circuit bent instruments as the
voice changing megaphone, Speak & Spell, and Casio SK-1.

Garth Zeglin is a professional roboticist and a journeyman artist.
His day job is developing legged robots at the Carnegie Mellon
Robotics Institute, but his quest is finding his artistic voice in
more poetic machinery. His current projects include robots suspended
in the air, talking mirrors, and pneumatic percussion instruments. He
is fascinated by elegantly simple technology and dynamic behavior,
and he seeks to balance his love of gadgetry with the expressive
needs of the work. The talk will include a short overview of past
projects, then zoom in on current work, presenting both technical and
artistic rationales, and culminate in a live demo during the break.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Featuring Sets by

Punisher

( Seismic, Matrix, Uppercut ) Detroit  MI

PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER:::::PUNISHER

Known in circles of Detroit and around the globe for her ambition and 
skills on the tables, Michelle Herrmann a.k.a. Punisher has set a 
precedence in a city known for it's fickle taste. Her Birth into the 
techno realm began in Detroit in 1993 at the age of 15 . DJ'ing wasn't 
enough, Michelle was constantly striving to grow and progress in her 
art. 1996 and 1997 she put out her first two releases on Detroit label 
Matrix records and then in 1998 , started her own label , Seismic 
Records with a friend and fellow producer Mike Brickner a.k.a. Cozmic 
Spore. Using the label as a tool push their own concepts of sound and 
motion they have in turn worked with and gained the respect of many 
world renowned DJs and producers. With releases from the Advent and 
Bryan Zentz and Andrei Morant , collaborations with legendary producer 
Mark Gage ( Vapourspace ), and liscensing from Dave Clarke and Billy 
Nasty .. to name a few, Seismic is developing into a strong Domestic 
force. Now on it's 20th release Seismic Records has become a unique tool 
that allows Punisher to continue moving in a new direction with her 
sound. She has brought over the synthy yet percussive styles of the 
Swedish / German techno producers and drawn upon her own Detroit roots 
for inspiration. To back the momentum of the Techno releases she travels 
the world DJing and performing LIVE P.A.'s as much as possible . Banging 
out amazing sets 100% of the time , her current sound has more 
dancefloor friendly roots, one's that your club or event is sure to 
appreciate. From Drum N' Bass, Techno, Electro and everything in 
between, she has repeatedly played throughout the US , Canada , Europe 
and Puerto Rico and has headlined large scale Famous events and clubs 
all around the World with . Joel Mull, Cari Lekebusch, Marco Carola, Ben 
Sims, Jay Denham, Misstress Barbara, Richie Hawtin, Dave Clarke, Derrick 
May, T-1000, Gaetano Parisio and many others. Michelle's music has also 
landed her a spot as guest DJ several radio stations including Satellite 
"XM RADIO" which signed a deal with Detroit's Motor giant GM for 
placement of it's radio in all new vehicles off the assembly line. On 
top of her game would be an understatement for Punisher, as her 
accomplishments are only a small portion of what she has planned for 
2005 and beyond.. Including a huge onslaught of releases lined up to 
come out and her First ever full length Album !!

Entertainment
techno

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OC_bntzP7o

Detroit-born, Chicago-and-Berlin-based Alan D. Oldham has been called 
"Detroit Techno's Renaissance Man" (Muzik, UK). A lifelong cartoonist 
and graphic designer, a young Oldham published his own comic book 
"Johnny Gambit" in 1987 to local notoriety. Hired that same year by 
Derrick May to illustrate several memorable pieces for the new Transmat 
label, led to Oldham's first involvement in the fledgling techno scene. 
Under his alias DJ T-1000, he has rocked crowds in Berlin, Rome, Warsaw, 
Barcelona, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and all points in between with his own brand 
of funky-ass techno. When he's not behind the decks or producing music 
for labels like Tresor Berlin, Pure Sonik and xfive, he's an illustrator 
who has shown in galleries in Chicago, Paris and Los Angeles. Showcasing 
his own productions, this fearless operator truly encompasses all that 
is "Electronica", combining film music with New Wave melodies, monotone 
club anthems with Grunge-inflected guitar feedback. Oldham`s output has 
taken down the borders, combined the concepts and blended the elements 
into autobiographical narrative. A true legend.

Local DJs are bringing it back together for an all electronic music

Check out:
DJ Howse Mowse
DJ Jason Damman

These guys are talented, spin some great music, and are down with the 
program to bring together a killer club night without a fifteen dollar 
cover. Moonshine will have a $5.00 cover ($8.00 for ages 18-20). We will 
bring in guest DJs. We will bring in special acts. We will try our 
damndest to do it all without raising the cover charge.

Thursdays                     THURSDAY WEEKLIES                  Where ever

cleveland--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off I'd like to say how nice it is to be back in Cleveland. It's 
been 15 years since I've lived here and it's good to see a thriving 
music scene. Seems like you got a nice nightlife community that all 
respect each other (can't say the same for NYC.) I'm enjoying porch life 
and listening to music in a car rather than an ipod in a sweaty-ass 
train.

My girl and I are throwing a new weekly Thursdays at TOUCH called 
DANDYLION beginning August 17th. It's a style we've been playing in 
NY...mixture of dirty rock, electro, a little bassy hip-hop & dub, 80's, 
classics and everything in between (Barry Manilow or Count Five anyone?) 
Pretty much just a good old house party! While we're not the most 
technical DJ's out there, I do think we play some tasty tracks that 
maybe haven't been in rotation here in Cleveland. NYC and LA are big up 
on the ecletic format these days...a style where anything goes. But I 
assure you we won't be playing any Kelly Clarkson or Simpson sh!t.

As I've research the scene here, seems like Cleveland may want a party 
like this. I see that CAN'T STOP THE BEAT is getting some crowds. It's 
refreshing to see the variety.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Hopefully you can make it out. Ask for me, 
Christian (Bells Nichols) or Gabriella.

PS~ Have a similar ecletic music style? Wanna guest DJ? Also, does 
anyone have Serato that I could borrow for Thursday nights? Mines on 
order but it hasn't come in the MF mail yet.

Kevin C. Smith is a musician and (bedroom) producer who also turns
obsolete toys and children's keyboards into unique musical
instruments through circuit bending. He will give an overview of
circuit bending including what to bend and basic techniques. He will
also present and demonstrate such circuit bent instruments as the
voice changing megaphone, Speak & Spell, and Casio SK-1.

Garth Zeglin is a professional roboticist and a journeyman artist.
His day job is developing legged robots at the Carnegie Mellon
Robotics Institute, but his quest is finding his artistic voice in
more poetic machinery. His current projects include robots suspended
in the air, talking mirrors, and pneumatic percussion instruments. He
is fascinated by elegantly simple technology and dynamic behavior,
and he seeks to balance his love of gadgetry with the expressive
needs of the work. The talk will include a short overview of past
projects, then zoom in on current work, presenting both technical and
artistic rationales, and culminate in a live demo during the break.
