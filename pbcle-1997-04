sounds like me last weekend. i had a burning desire to remix hi-ho from
snow white and the seven dwarfs and stuff off u2's WAR..didnt work as well
as i planned cuz i dont own an of the rekkids i was using to mix them. glad
i wasnt in front of people who cared. i managed to do this once, but i
couldnt do it again;  erasure's "always" and snoop dog

 "always i wanna be with you and [bump] be a mutha fucking hustler;
{rewind}i wanna be [cut]wanna be a a muthafucking [fade] harmony and
harmony o love {cut to music box and funk bassline]"

p.s. disney records are gr8 for vocal samples
fantasia and peter and the wolf are epic

well i can understand both sides of this.  i'm with trouty in several
repects, and would go perhaps even further to say that i'm SICK TO
DEATH OF FUCKING RAVES!

- same candy-ass, badly designed flyers
- same candy-ass, badly selected DJs
- same expensive prices
- same empty promises
- same cracked-out atmosphere

i am living proof that raves do NOT have to stay stagnant, raves do not
have to have full-color flyers to succeed (in fact i have NEVER done one,
that's right, NEVER), raves do not need stellar lineups of all house and
slow-breaks crap to bring the kids.  i really hate to toot my own horn but
i completely understand why jamie is being so cynical about parties, and i
myself am completely SICK of being literally the only person who is trying
to do something different, really different (okay there's a few people who
are doing it in their own way, but still).

so there's that.  on the other hand i completely respect what steve had to
say in defense of 420.v2.  smaller parties build the scene, larger parties
define them.  a huge party like 420.v2 is something we won't see in our
area for a long time, and it's what i would call a world-class party, with
a world-class lineup.  smaller parties simply cannot offer this class of
national and international talent.  so i understand what steve and the
responsible people behind the 420.v2 concept are after, and i admire them
for really trying to up the stakes.

they are simply different propositions.  

perhaps the problem is that too many promoters are aiming their sights too
high, doing larger, glitzier events when they ought to be trying to do
smaller, more modest ones.  the scene will kill itself with a big party
every week, and i for one can't wait till it does die so i can get back
down to the business of doing some REAL shit.  those of you who are
nodding right now know exactly what i mean.

Yeah, he sent me mail which said it was a mix of Loser and Gold, which I 
assume is of his own wax tweakin'.  I give this much more props than the 
idea of a remix of loser for some official "Beck goes Jungle remix ep."

WELL SIR, THERE WERE 150 DATA FLASHES AT THE EVENT, THEY WERE DISTRIBUTED
BETWEEN 3 ROOMS, AND KEVY KEV THE FLYER GUY CALLED THE CYBERLIGHTS
"GODLIGHTS" AND THERE WERE ACTUALLY 16 OF THEM!! ADD TO THAT 34

AT THE SHOW, THAT HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE! ALL BUT 1 OF THE DJ'S

PRESENTING EVERYTHING I PROMISE AT EACH SHOW I DO.
THE PRODUCTION WE PRESENT IS ALWAYS WORTH THE ENTRY PRICE OF OUR SHOWS,

well, to be sure we're on the same wavelength: dataflashes are small
compact strobelights that have a master controller running them in
patterns/sync.  150/3=50. i dont remember seeing no 50 strobe lights being
used in any one of the 3 rooms,  i recall 4 larger strobes in the main room
hung from the trusses.  
>AND KEVY KEV THE FLYER GUY CALLED THE CYBERLIGHTS
>"GODLIGHTS" AND THERE WERE ACTUALLY 16 OF THEM!!
most everyone i hear speak of "godlights" is referring to the lights that
are circular/octagonal with 8 moving mirrors that move independent of each
other and usually have an array of mirrors in the middle that rotate.  i.e.
krypto's, megadroids, harmony digital, et al....  any there?  nope...
>ADD TO THAT 34
>INTELLABEAMS, 8 VIPERS AND ON THE LASER TIP, WE HAD ALL OF CENTRAK'S LASERS
>AT THE SHOW, THAT HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE!
but the patterns have.  they havent done any new ones in the three years
i've seen them.  brian said he hasnt seen any new ones in 5 years....  that
is until easter nite at trilogy.  c'mon how many times have we all seen the
running woman and the spiral ball?  its not like buying _NEW_ equipment or
lights, rather _PROGRAMMING_ the computer driving the laser.  i also must
add that the new programs are _VERY_ impressive!!  and the show sunday was
__EXCELLENT!!!___

>ALL BUT 1 OF THE DJ'S

didn't say a damn thing about the dj's, since noone knew when they were on
and i dont know the faces of most there, the ones i did know were there and
i remember hearing about 1 or 2 not there?  i know dj's dont show and i
know usually its not the promoters fault (not always the case, but usually)

>SO BEFORE YOU GO SLAGGING A SHOW THAT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST SHOW

i was there and saw what i saw (or didnt see)

>PS. THE RECORD LABEL LOGO'S ARE TO GO ALONG WITH THE DJ'S REPRESENTING EACH
>RESPECTIVE LABEL!
i figured as much.  sometimes it seems a stretch and almost an implication
that somehow the _label_ itself is involved with the party....  it just
depends where on the flyer they are...  after the dj's name--or after the
promoters name.  marketing i suppose...

okay...


just wondering if we're going to have a net meet for planet orange?  i'm
going to hit laga first that night...you know, show my support for cmu
dj's but afters, i'm going to hit planet orange.


so, what time should we set the time?  

what happened to the pb-cle raves badge or something like that????


i guess if we decide on a meet, perhaps we can be really specific on
times and maybe someone can hold up a sign or something...i don't know
about any of yous but i'm too shy to randomly walk up to someone and ask
if they subscribe to this, ya know?

Ditto that.  If an 'official jungle version' of the song ever comes out, 
I'm going to stop spinning and listen to .MODs exclusivly.

hello everyone. 
i was just wondering if anyone went to soiled in cleveland last saturday?
does anyone even know where it was at?

gill and i went to the tuffest. it was at jenga world. i think its a nice
big space although it is too big for the amount of ppl that actually come
out. good price $13 with canned food, $15 without. we only got to hear
kevin bumpers, sine, phantom, and the beginning of abstract's set. 
kevin bumpers should stick to house, sine had a nice set aside frm a few
skips in the middle that irritated him, phantom was great as usual (played
woman who rolls yaya), and the beginning of abstracts set was good too. 
i still dont think that cleveland has fully caught on to the drum&bass
thing yet. there were at most probably 30 ppl dancing at once at the high
points. *shrug* we left early b/c easter was the next morning. 

was anyone else from the lists at either of the cleveland parties?

[a late and long message, but one i needed to write]

(N): NITROGEN, the 7th ele_ment concert event, was not the kind of event
that was meant to appeal to the usual "rave" crowd.  that's probably the
first thing that has to be said about it. 

the flyer was a simple folded square on cardstock, featuring a
representation of the nitrogen atom (the usual ele_mental-style atomic
motif) and the event info, printed in blue to look something like a
blueprint. 

the lineup was equally non-traditional, featuring names that you might
recognize if you've been paying close attention to what we've been doing--
but if you haven't, you probably wouldn't have any idea what this event
was all about (even tho it's explained in concise detail on the flyer
itself).  so it really had very little to offer people who expect
something more traditional from a rave, except perhaps a new experience.

the interesting thing is that they came anyway.  obscure-ass flyer,
almost-unknown lineup, no empty promises, and they still came.  350
people.  not only do i think this justifies the value of small events, but
it also verifies some other things i have been thinking:

1) the current scene is such that people will go to pretty much _anything_
   that is going on in their area, if nothing else is going on elsewhere,
   and sometimes even if there IS something else going on (the prime
   motivating factors being fun, socializing, boredom, and drugs--not
   necessarily in that order ;) 

2) cheap/low-key parties do have a following in the scene, whatever
   people's reasoning may be.  perhaps they are always broke, or cheap, or
   don't like to travel out-of-town (i know a lot of those ppl), work
   late every weekend, are sick of paying $20 for crap parties, or just
   appreciate the vibe that only a smaller event can provide.  whatever
   the reasoning, small parties can work. 

3) least importantly, SOME people are getting the message me and my cru
   are trying to preach.  whatever THAT is ;)

for me, like most of the events i am responsible (or mostly-responsible) 
for, it was a culmination of a lot of things.  this one was truly an
e(d)le_mental production like never before--i did just about EVERYTHING
from its inception until its wrapup (well, mike mccusty did deprive me of
that honor by staying to help clean, but still ;). 

as usual, i picked the date and selected the lineup, did the flyer,
promotion, found the space, and did 99% of the running around before the
event.  usually, if you see the ele_mental name on a flyer by itself,
that's what it means.  i'm not complaining (because i do get help when i
need it, especially the day of the event) but this was MY event, even
moreso than usual. for example, i didn't mail ANY flyers to anyone,
partially because i was late in getting my shit together, but also because
i wasn't counting on much of an out-of town crowd (because of the obscure
lineup). 

not only that, i began to feel that the event was jinxed.  first of all,
in early march i realized that i had made a crucial mistake in selecting
the date, being that it was right at the tail end of spring break, so half
of my crowd wouldn't even be around!! 

and this was just the beginning.  nearly everything went wrong at some
point: performers i wanted couldn't do it or wanted ungodly amounts of
money (i originally wanted someone from detroit to play but that didn't
work out).  printing was a problem.  money was a problem.  the space was
UNBELIEVABLY DIRTY when i first laid eyes on it, and i found out the
bathroom had not been turned on as promised.  even as the event started
(late), the elements were against us: there was a tornado watch and
pouring rain, some of which found itself dripping into a dusty chimney
which began to spackle wet globs of dust all over myung's keyboards. then,
the news that powerhouse's keyboard was completely DEAD, no repair
possible.

at this point i was almost about to throw my hands in the air in defeat,
but, stubborn person that i am, i decided (as i had decided numerous times
throughout the month of jinx) to fight this bad luck demon with every
ounce of effort i possibly could, no matter what the consequences.  and it
payed off.  

the weather cleared.  the chimney was plugged up.  rick ratvasky lent
powerhouse another keyboard.  and 350 people, from almost every
counterculture (punk, industrial, old-school, rave, club, intelligent
techno, hacker, ARA, art, fellow electronic musicians, and probably a few
others) came to enjoy a night of astounding musical diversity...everything
from harsh improvised ambience, to industrial/lounge/sex music, to smooth
techno/jungle, to throbbing techno traxx.  and that was just the
performers! 

we finally got the event going at about 10.30, and steve wymer began his
performance as SPINE.  steve had also opened the ambient/experimental room
at SNOW*DRIFT, and this performance was no less unique.  this one-man band
spent almost an hour making incredibly harsh sounds of every conceivable
timbre, from the icy and mechanical to the warm and abrasive (and
everything in between). random beats, a metal spring rubbed against a
guitar, severely-treated sounds, and a completely improvisational approach
combined to make a forbidding atmosphere that was the perfect beginning
and had the ravers raising their eyebrows in confusion.

up next was THE WEIRD LOVE MAKERS, a truly bizarre experience if ever
there was one.  involving these guys was my attempt to give props to the
old-school columbus electronic musicians, because every one of these
guys--jeff central, greg fernandez, and mark gunderson--have been devoted
to making electronic/experimental music in columbus for a decade and even
longer.  not only are they worthy of respect because of their longevity,
but jeff and mark have been in touch with what we've been doing too, and
their music interacts with techno and dance music in various ways.  so
including them was not only a sign of respect but also a chance to put
their music firmly in the dance music context.

so for about an hour, the WLMs rocked the house with their bizarre
combination of dance/lounge beats (not always in sync--on purpose),
overlayed with samples from every imaginable source: porno movies,
bloopers, horror flicks, commercials, and so on.  infectious, funky
rhythms abounded, with mark and jeff doing the sequencing honors, and greg
doing live turntable tricks and playing tapes.  all that and a go-go
dancer too (our good kinko's friend carmel), with a lighted stage even!

following this madness was MYUNGHO CHOI, who lugged and incredible amount
of electronic gear to this incredibly dusty space.  what followed was
completely different from the WLMs, and more dance-friendly, but equally
interesting.  myung's music often reminds me of old YELLOW MAGIC ORCHESTRA
and early-80s synth-pop, but it's obviously updated for our time and there
are no vocals whatsoever.  his melodies are obvious, his rhythms somewhat
predictable, his structures tend to be static (not active), but the entire
package is still amazingly appealing.  his music manages to be accessible,
fun, and obscure at the same time.  

and this set was perhaps the most drastic version i've ever experienced,
because he performed what he called "jungle," but which does not fit any
known definition of jungle.  myung's jungle is basically very fast techno
with syncopations, and with his strong melodic sense it is reminiscent of
BLACK DOG and other similar "intelligent" techno, but it is clearly
aligned with jungle enough to be familiar.  thankfully, the experiment
also got the crowd moving significantly for the first time. 

the final performer was kevin kennedy (powerhouse) as THE SLEEP ENGINEER. 
a last-minute keyboard change and kevin managed to get his equipment
going.  what followed was over an hour of unbridled techno FURY, with
moments of peace and contemplation mixed in for good measure.  he began
with a few more experimental pieces which really tweaked the mind, like
BASIC CHANNEL but even more cracked-out, and he even sung off-key vocals
to one of the tracks.  from this territory he moved into more thumping
techno realms, and even doing a gabber song (for which a surprise guest MC
JAMALSKI made a perfect pairing).  all the while kevin worked and tweaked
the songs live, using his sequences as the barest of templates, building
and improvising with various layers of sound.  and of course, in typical
powerhouse style, the sound was pushed to the max (or at least it sounded
like it), distorted to painful lengths.  a definite crowd-pleaser, even
the guys from the WLMs loved it (i saw mr old-school himself, greg
fernandez, dancing pretty hard to kevin's tunes...and if you know greg,
this is an incredibly cool thing ;). 

a brief interlude allowed mark gunderson to play his remix for DJ spooky,
while we made the transition from live performers to DJs.  ADAM MARSHALL
from toronto took to the decks first and rocked the house like only few
others could. his fast and furious techno traxx were received with hands
in the air and heads bobbing like mad all over the place.  i couldn't
believe people in columbus, of all places, were actually getting into such
hard and traxxy stuff (why do i only expect people to like house and
slow-breasks these days?  am i that cynical?).  anyway, adam is basically
the minimal/fast/hard/traxxy techno GOD in my book, second only to STUFF
(hee hee jeff, i'm pulling your leg!). 

ANDROMEDA (aaron shinn) stepped up after adam, and proceeded to bust out
the most abstract jungle known to humanity--beginning with lots of old
favorites from the reinforced posse (our jungle soulmates ;), and then
dropping down into the darkest, most technical side of jungle...photek,
source direct, and other beat-ninjas.  jamalski jumped in to MC for aaron
at several points, perhaps a bit ill-suited for such abstract, "mental" 
music, but an interesting combination nonetheless.  the reception from the
crowd was less enthusiastic, but the punk in me thought that it was pretty
cool to annoy everyone with crazy shit like this at 3.30 AM.  besides,
it's not that people weren't into it, it's just that they didn't dance too
hard (most people seemed to be listening intently, perhaps trying to find
a danceable beat ;).  either way, aaron performed one of the best sets
he's done in quite a while, cutting things up rudebwoy style with mad
crossfader action. 

after aaron came TIM MADONNA, who brought people back into the dancing
mood with some tweaked-out techno and a few old-school techno trax.  i had
expected tim to play more housey stuff (out of respect for the kids, and
because i love house at the right times), but what can i do--go up to him
and say: "hey tim, could you play happier shit?"  believe me, there's
nothing more annoying than being told what to play while you're in the
middle fo a set. anyway, i thought tim did fine, i wanted him to play
whatever the hell he wanted to play.  as a DJ, he's come a long way and i
predict that it won't be too long before you'll be seeing his name much
more often. 

our own net grrl greta came on next as ELIAS, sliding a wooden pallette up
to the tables to get some height.  she seemed extremely nervous but by the
time she went on the party was thinning considerably, so i'm sure the
pressure she felt was mostly self-imposed (i know about THAT one).  the
end result was that she had some serious troubles with beatmixing,
although to be honest, i think most people that stay at parties past 4AM
are too tweaked out to notice beatmixing anyway.  her blend of music was
about as eclectic as can be--everything from slow funky breaks, to
electro, to hard traxx, to jungle.  and despite her troubles i feel that
she'll always be able to look back at the experience and learn a lot from
it. that's the only way to get started...by learning how it feels to spin
in front of people, and with a loud sound system blaring behind/beside
you.

poor rick madden (LIVID) closed the party, playing jungle from about 6AM
to 7AM to a mostly-empty room (by that time there was literally only about
10 of us left).  sad thing was, i was very very impressed with his DJ
skills. his mixes were smooth, his backspins and mixer tricks were
well-executed, and the music (a sort of darker version of jump-up with
some tech-step mixed in) was definitely solid and consistent (even if that
isn't necessarily my preferred style of jungle).  i put him last thinking
we would be able to keep close to the schedule (and we actually did except
for a couple minor things--but they added up), which would have meant him
playing about 45 minutes earlier.  basically i booked rick because he
never gets to play out and i've heard him really tear it up...so i felt
like it was about time for me to do a little something to help him build
up his DJ profile.  i know that having a jungle DJ go last is always a
risky thing, but if the theme of the entire event so far had been "i don't
give a fuck," then having rick play last fit that mood perfectly.  i'm
sure that's not what he wanted, but i hope i get the chance to hook him up
again (or encourage others to do so--that's right promoters!  book rick
madden!! heh). 

anyway, after this, we closed down for the night (morning), cleaned the
space, and then went home, dirty and dusty.

as i look back on the event i am amazed by how well it went.  it summed up
so much about what i am trying to do.  bringing together the diverse forms
of musical appreciation (whether sitting at a performance or dancing to a
DJ, for example) into a cohesive event that can attract a very diverse
crowd, is somthing i have been trying to do for a long time.  not only
that, but being able to expose new listeners to the music being made by
older electronic musicians is very satisfying.

maybe i turned some people off if they had never been to an ele_mental
concert event before; they'll probably think that all our parties are just
as weird, and not "fun" enough.  but for me, it's not just about "fun." 
fun is an important part of it (obviously, or else i wouldn't be putting
my life into this stuff as deeply as i have), but it's also about creating
something slightly different than what people expect--something to
challenge, educate, expose, and intrigue those people out there who are
curious.

i know i'm one of those curious people, in fact that's part of the reason
i got involved in doing all of this in the first place.  however, the
current rave scene is not challenging me in a any way, so i feel it's up
to me to challenge myself, and hopefully drag a few people along for the
ride. 

we'll all learn different things from events (whether they be ones i do or
ones other people do), but perhaps the most important thing is that we
keep our eyes and ears and minds open, and never let ourselves feel too
comfortable with what we know.  because anyone who decides that they know
"enough" is ending a process within themselves and is closing themselves
off in their own selfish little world.  we all do it, it's inevitable, but
if these can events help bring us to another kind of awareness, another
kind of learning, another kind of HUMANITY, don't we owe it to ourselves 
to find out???

a rhetorical question, to end a long post.
 
thanks for listening.

Get Busy was an OK party, it really had a lot of problems though. first of
all, as people have already said, there basically was no dancefloor, just
a huge tract of deep, soft farm mud under a circus tent. the lights and
sound were both nice (although it didn't sound anywhere NEAR the 'over
90,000 watts' as promised on the flyer). probably the coolest thing i saw
there was the real time video/anime mixing...really wild stuff. a lot of
it consisted of what looked like cheesy japaneese tv shows along with lots
of anime footage, i even glanced up a couple of times to see some weird
japaneese s&m type porno that was subtitled. the thing that sucked about
the video mixing though was they had a huge screen hung right down the
middle of the dancefloor between the speaker stacks, so it basically cut
the dancefloor in half and made it impossible to see the djs unless you
were right in front. i guess most of the people were hanging around
towards the front of the park where there were some benches, etc...because
there weren't many people in the tent after around 3am. i can't blame them
either, the mud was so mushy that if you stepped up too fast when walking
around you could have easily lost a shoe...i made sure i had mine tied
extra tight. after people started thinning out under the tent i was able
to dance some, some people had some road signs/plywood and other random
surfaces down to dance on. the djs were all great, james christian and
nigel richards both spun terrific sets, but not many people were in the
mood to dance. it was nice later in the morning, as the sun started to
come up they rolled up the sides of the tents, so it was almost like being
outside. for the people that did stick around to the end, it was a nice
experience watching the sun come up while dancing. i felt like it was
worth the time/money to get there since i got a chance to hear a lot of
east cost djs i wouldnt normally get a chance to hear spin, but a discount
would have been nice considering the muddy conditions. i couldn't believe
they didn't at least put down one of those big tarps (like they use at
baseball games). but after i stopped giving a fuck about my shoes and
pants i had a decent time...if this party would have been in the indoor
soccer stadium it would have been the bomb. so did anyone get any
skittles? i saw the ground outside littered with skittle wrappers but i
never got any :( ow well, thats my late review..

well i haven't seen anybody talking about this phenomenal lineup, so i'm
wondering if anyone's even coming.  damn, y'all...t-1000, dieselboy,
goodwill, derrick carter, dan curtin, and a live show by titonton with
real strings and a vocal performer, all for a reasonable price, and it
still AIN'T ENOUGH?!?!  what must we promoters do to please you?!?  (hehe) 

anyway, on the assumption that some of you are coming, here's the
directions...

the space is the downtown YMCA, 40 w. long st.  please keep in mind that 
NO SMOKING WILL BE ALLOWED inside the building.

from the N take 71 S to downtown, look for 670, go W. 

from the S take 71 N past downtown, take 670 W.

from the E or W take 70 to 71 N, pass downtown, find 670 W.

once on 670 W take it and get off at THIRD ST.  take third st S about 2
lights to SPRING ST, go R, then one block to FRONT ST, another R, go one
block N to LONG, and you will see the YMCA on the right.  parking is
available on several lots within a one-block radius of the Y.  the
entrance is on long st, then go upstairs to the main gym.

again we cannot reiterate strongly enough that there will be NO SMOKING 
ALLOWED IN THE BUILDING.  also, to prevent any problems with the gym 
floor, please wear athletic shoes if possible.

doors open at 11PM, admission will be $10 from 11PM to 12mid, or $13 
thereafter.

lineup (subject to change):

stefan manceau 		11.00 - 12.00
jay goodwill		12.00 -  1.00
t-1000			 1.00 -  2.00
dieselboy		 2.00 -  3.00
titonton LIVE
with marzipan ensemble	 3.00 -  3.45
dan curtin		 3.45 -  4.45
derrick carter		 4.45 -  6.00
stella wong		 6.00 -  7.00

net-meet anyone?

ok, there's a scratch pb-cle badge (or rather, one side of it) up on my webpage

I wouldn't bother printing it out nicely for this version, but at least
y'all would have something...

funny and weird true stories:

"It is wonderful to be here in the great state of Chicago"

                               -Former U.S. Vice-President Dan Quayle

"Republicans understand the importance of bondage between a mother and
child. "

				          on Republican family values

Natron Fubble tried to rob a Miami delicatessen, but the owner broke 
Fubble's nose by hitting it with a giant salami. Fubble fled and hid 
in the trunk of a parked car. The car belonged to a police undercover 
team that was trailing another criminal's truck. After five days, the 
officers finally heard Fubble whimpering and arrested him.

Police in Bari, Italy, arrested a man suspected of snatching handbags 
to finance his drug addiction after he sped past one woman on his 
motorcycle and snatched her purse. The woman was his mother, who 
recognized him and reported him, said a police spokesperson, adding, 
"We were rather surprised by the whole episode, I must admit."

In January, Mathew Panak, president of the Warren (Ohio) Board of 
Trustees, said the regularly scheduled Monday meeting would take place
on Jan. 16, even though it was the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. 
Said Panak, "None of us is colored. It's not going to affect us." 
Several days later, Panak changed his mind and postponed the meeting.

In a February Los Angeles Times story on the San Francisco Zoo's
annual Valentine's Day mating-practices tour, the pygmy hippopotamus
seemed the most hapless exhibit. According to zoo official Jane
Tollini, "Roly" has lived with his mate "Poly" since 1969 with no
success. "He'd put it in her ear," said Tollini. "He'd put it under
her arm. In 26 years he never put it in the right spot."

Farmer Janet Bonney found one of her chickens frozen under her porch
in Harpswell, Maine. She tried to put the bird's body in a shoe box
for burial, but its frozen legs couldn't bend. When she used hot water
to thaw the bird enough to make it fit, she heard it breathe and used 
mouth-to-beak resuscitation to revive it.

An American student in London to a London resident: "Wow, you mean
like when you hear Americans, you think we have an accent. That's so 
strange."

Bryce Davis overheard the following conversation between college 
Freshman who were comparing class schedules: 
"What do you have?"
"Chemistry."
"Who teaches it?"
"I don't know this professor. Who's Dr. Staff?"

Russ Mannix sent this to me. Several years ago in his high school 
Public Speaking class, a speech by one student involved passing a
glass eye around the class. When the speaker asked if there were any
questions, one of the students noticed that the glass eye wasn't 
transparent and said, "I don't understand. How do blind people see 
through this?"

One of my readers, Trini, swears the following is true. During a tour 
of Yellowstone National Park, the tour guide asked if there were any 
questions. A woman in a pink plastic miniskirt and high heels stood up
and asked where the park rangers put the cages for the animals to
sleep in at night. Later, she asked, "How do you call the animals?
With a whistle or do the park rangers just turn off the lights so the
animals know to come in?"

Tech Support: "Hello, ESM tech support."
Customer: "I've got to stop this before my computer is ruined."
Tech Support: "What seems to be the problem, Miss?"
Customer: "Well, I put your demo disk in the slot. And I typed 'A' and
 the colon. And then I put down 'PKUNZIP DEMO.ZIP C:' like it says on 
 the label."
Tech Support: "Yes."
Customer: "And now something inside my computer is exploding!"

Customer: Now what do I do? 
Tech Support: What is the prompt on the screen? 
Customer: It's asking for "Enter Your Last Name." 
Tech Support: Okay, so type in your last name. 
Customer: How do you spell that?

Cust: Look, look!!!!! Look what it's doing!!! Can you BELIEVE this?? 
 Why is it doing that?? 
Tech: (keeps saying: ) Sir, I can't see your computer, what is it 
 doing?? 
Cust: (keeps saying: ) WHAT??? Can't you figure it out?? LOOK AT MY 
 COMPUTER SCREEN!!!!! You can see it, can't you?!

Hi, I'm offering two really good mixtapes for sale. They both contain
good, NEW techno tracks.


"Children of Paradise" - from nice techno-house, to deep techno to
hardcore, this is one of my most interesting mixes.. I just mixed this
this morning. One shot, no planning, this will properly show my
talents... you will be refreshed by the unique composition techniques. I
only had these records for four days, but this tape smokes...


"Untitled" - more techno, deep, hard, funky or smooth, all real
underground, a bit harder than the other one... another excellent mix.
also mixed one-shot.




they're both tightly mixed, and let me tell ya, they're excellent
tapes!! better than many "name" deejays, take my word!!  please buy
them, you won't regret, (unless you're into cheesy trance and other
conthrived sh*t)!! my talents shine through these. promotors interested
in a free copy please e-mail me. oh yeah, special offer for the next two
weeks: only $6 each, includes shipping. I am also interested in trades
with other deejays.


Some of the usual suspects on these tapes: l.a. williams, gene hunt,
t-1000, frankie bones, adam x, adam beyer, raoul delgardo, cristian
vogel, neil landstrumm,... that's just the tip of the 'burgh. techno at
its best!!


peace & respects,
paul/dj rome

okay i messed one thing up, i just hope titonton doesn't kill me, or any
of you who are reading this, say, SATURDAY ;o...

what i messed up was this:

get to 670 W, get off at THIRD ST exit, go S for **4** lights (not 2), to
**GAY ST** (not spring!), go 2 lights to FRONT ST, go R, take front st one
block N to LONG ST, and the Y will be on the right. 

here's the long version again, corrected.  i hope this doesn't/didn't mess
anyone up terribly.  if so, my profuse apologies!

**

the space is the downtown YMCA, 40 w. long st.  please keep in mind that 
NO SMOKING WILL BE ALLOWED inside the building.

from the N take 71 S to downtown, look for 670, go W. 

from the S take 71 N past downtown, take 670 W.

from the E or W take 70 to 71 N, pass downtown, find 670 W.

once on 670 W take it and get off at THIRD ST.  take third st S about 4
lights to GAY ST, go R, then one block to FRONT ST, another R, go one
block N to LONG, and you will see the YMCA on the right.  parking is
available on several lots within a one-block radius of the Y.  the
entrance is on long st, then go upstairs to the main gym.

again we cannot reiterate strongly enough that there will be NO SMOKING 
ALLOWED IN THE BUILDING.  also, to prevent any problems with the gym 
floor, please wear athletic shoes if possible.

doors open at 11PM, admission will be $10 from 11PM to 12mid, or $13 
thereafter.

lineup (slightly changed):

stella wong 		11.00 - 12.00
jay goodwill		12.00 -  1.00
t-1000			 1.00 -  2.00
dieselboy		 2.00 -  3.00
titonton LIVE
with marzipan ensemble	 3.00 -  3.45
dan curtin		 3.45 -  4.45
derrick carter		 4.45 -  6.00
stefan manceau		 6.00 -  7.00

Greetings Netizens

I wanna thank everyone who came to REUNION last night.  Snowball and
DKNY played great sets.  I can't believe the dance floor was still going
strong at 8am.

Our next REUNION is on May 3rd.  I'll send out e-flyer when DJs are
confirmed.

Peace.

Hi, 

        I'm new on the list, and just wanted to make myself known, because I
am obviously getting jealous of reading all of your posts and seeing none of
my own.  I haven't been to a rave for awhile because I am a mere high school
student from Pgh.  Oh well, I hope to meet some of you soon around here, and
I will look forward to hearing from anyone on the list.  

Much love
-Steve "Paco" Harding

i shit you not.  this weekend i was shown a flyer for some large party in
Atlanta, i believe.  i think it was called FUSION or something.  anyway, it
had a really lame east coast lineup but the flyer and the names were *huge*.
so i look at all of the names and in huge print are the words "Native
American Indians".  WHAT?!?!?!?!  it even had a description of them!  i
forgot what it said though.  something along the lines of "natures parents
joining us w/ tribal drumming" or some bullshit.

so i thought to myself, "real life native americans?!?  WOW!  i'm
there!"....haha only kidding.

this has got to be the most ridiculous thing i have EVER seen on a flyer in
my entire life.  i laughed about it for quite some time even though i could
see how many people would take offense to it.  

my new catch phrase when anyone asks me about lineups at parties will be "oh
sure, that's great.  but do they have LIVE NATIVE AMERICANS?"  i think i can
get months of enjoyment out of that.

this definitely takes the cake from the previous winner, which was "Live
Glass Blowing!"  from last year's 420 flyer.

what a world we live in, eh?

parties in PGH and that I'm a sucka for paying 25 bones to go to them. 
but at least somewhere in the country they know how to throw phat jammy
jams (read: sputnik 7).  oh yeah.

        Didn't anyone have little voice saying  "Keoki is a flake and maybe
this party is gona suck."

        Sorry that it was a bomb, goes show money, flyers, and names arn't
everything.

ps. Maybe you should check out Melmac, good vibes and music, and only $5,
so if it does suck you haven't lost $25.

This likens to what happened at the QWorld's Fairs around the turn of the
century.  They'd bring in "savages" from far off "uncivilized" cultures
and make them live in these replica villages and whatnot.  Anglo
superiority at its finest, eh? :(

There's a really good book about this sort of thing called Ota Benga if
anyones hast the time/is interested.

Tea, an' all-

I'm expecting one more tape from John Arroyo at some point this week or next, and then
I'm going to give all the submissions to Tea for his step in the process.  Currently, we've got about 6-8 people 
who've given me tapes...I can't remember everyone right now...so we've got plenty of material.

At any rate, if you've got a tape that you want to get to me, please do so by 4/18/97.

Sound okay to everyone?

Thanks,

I just wanted to send out a mega 'thank you' for the organisers of Spin 
Cycle this past Saturday.  I had an excellent time there, and I really 
needed to get that out of my system.  I can now honestly say that I like 
jungle, now that I know how to dance to it (hint:  don't try to hit every 
beat!).  This post started going west, so I'm going to close off by 
thanking everyone involved once again.

Yeah, Laga was a good time.  I was there, and I don't even DJ for WRCT
(really, I don't, I'm just a lowly WPTS-FM 10 watt sound hack he he). I
feel sorry for people who left town and went to see SuperStar Keoki for
$25 when they could have stayed in Oakland and heard WE construct a killer
set of live music (yeah, they showed up, and crushed us with sound, too),
benefitting local radio and supporting our scene for $5.  Heads don't know
where the underground sounds are these days, I guess, 'cause if you
haven't checked out the NYC Illbient sound, as crafted by DJs Olive and
Loop, then you're missing out on the future.  (How's that for an
instigating comment :-)

WAIT.  Live electronic music at LAGA???  Why wasn't this publicized?
Damn...I would've totally wiped my schedule clean if I'da known that.

That's two live acts that I've missed:  Freaky Chakra vs. Single Cell Orchestra, opening up for
the last Meat Beat show (this was totally unannounced - and I was pissed), and now this.

grr.

why has nobody written anything about indigo yet? i was hoping for
somebody else to write the big review on it. *sigh* i'm doing the
(relatively!) little review all ritht? =] we got there sometime after 
12. so i missed stella wong & can't say anything about her. i think i 
heard about 1/2 of dieselboy's set. it was dark, but too serious for 
me, and usually the stuff he spins is more fun. i'm not sure who was 
after him, goodwill? well i was socializing at the time so i don't 
remember his set. then lainey (i don't know if i spelled her name
right) wanted me to work at the door so i did that for about an hr +
1/2, when i was done, titonton was on, along with the violinists. 
everybody loved his PA, and it was so neat to watch how he can
simultaneously do that + conduct the violin players. after him was dan
curtin, who i had never seen before, spinning detroit. he has a lot of
good records. next was i think derrick carter or was that goodwill? i
don't know. whoever it was, he spun hard house and did lots of cool
crazy tweaky EQ things. last on was stefan manceau. he spun detroit
too, it was really good. i had also never seen him before. he seemed
to have a few problems near the beginning, it sounded like a couple of
the records were really hard to mix. but the rest of his set was
great, i was dancing like crazy all over! =] what was the last record
he put on? it was clear & had no color, and a white label. was it a
dubplate? i'm not sure if i've seen a dubplate before, but i heard
they are all 10" & i think this one was 12". anyway, when titonton,
dan curtin, + a bunch of other people looked at it, they were acting
like it was a magic record or something, but i wasn't sure why. it
sounded like it had about 4 tracks on it but they were all mixed
together like part of a mixtape but on vinyl. to end the set he
(stefan manceau) did this amazing huge long rewind that was a normal
speed at 1st then sped up faster + faster to probably 300 bpm, wow!
thanks to everybody that helped clean afterward, i think it was done
in record time. it was weird when the YMCA people saw the space as it
was getting cleaned up because they were really wigged out and were
saying it was trashed + yelling at lainey about the most ridiculous 
trivial things, even though it wasn't that bad at all. thanks also to 
everyone that went outside if they wanted to smoke, because there 
weren't nasty cigarette butts all over the floor. but they were all 
over the sidewalk outside, too bad there hadn't been any trash cans
out there. and thanks to walt + leslie for having the afterhours
party! i heard jonathan spin jazzy intelligent jungle. then vergil
spun techstep jungle (now i know what techstep is! i like it a lot!).
then jeff spun house + breaks. then i got to spin, detroit (mostly), 
ed said he couldn't review my set (that's ok :] )because he was out 
of it (sleeping) but he just knew it was hard :]. all the records i
bought lately are like that, hard & minimal + they don't seem as 
difficult to mix, so i think i can concentrate on 1 thing + get
better. ed i promise i'll make you a good tape as soon as i can! 
chris's tape deck isn't working right + i haven't been able to find
anyplace else. next titonton went on + spun deep jazzy house, with the
the trademark titonton tricks + sampling. wow! i was very impressed. 
after brandon spun deep house, by this time it was about 11 am but i
was still dancing! we finally left at about noon, went record
shopping, then i couldn't find I-71, + drove way out of the way &
finally found it and we went home. hmmm this ended up being a longer
review than i thought it would be =]...

Titonton was awesome...i really enjoyed the combination of live music and
recorded music.  Violins are the best instruments anyways so I was happy.  

The space was clean...a real plus in my book...with running water...what
a concept.  The vibe was good.  I liked the fact that there was not a
whole lot of lighting. All that stuff is a waste...all we need is good
DJs...that is what makes a party not the other stuff.

ok, i would have written my review of Indigo sooner but i've been sick the
last couple of days. anyways, after some minor problems finding the space,
we finally found a parking space and got there at about 11:45. the party
was at the downtown YMCA, really nice space...clean bathrooms, the YMCA
people would also fill up your water bottles for you too. you had to walk
up a few flights up steps to get to the dancefloor, so things got kinda
congested at some times. the lighting upstairs was minimal and nice, there
was also a video projection screen showing some weird stock footage and
fractals. the sound, i thought, was very good. im not sure if this was the
same setup used at Intimate but it was very loud and crisp, unlike at
Intimate when the sound turned to mud if you weren't right in front. if
someone is 100% sure about the order of the djs then correct me, i was
kinda out of it that night...so when we got there someone was spinning
diva house, which im not a big fan of, i'm going to assume this was Stella
Wong, i didnt go up to look at the dj. i socialized for awhile and went
back to the dancefloor at about 12:15 only to hear some more diva/euro
house, i believe this was Jay Goodwill, i left again and came back up at
about 12:45 and he was spinning some hard house which was pretty cool. i
danced for the rest of his set, and when the djs changed i was expecting
T-1000 but instead Dieselboy came on and exploded. i was expecting much
more of a ruff/jumpup style of jungle, but he was spinning some dark dark
tracks, i loved it (being the big dark/techstep fan that i am). some his
material wasnt all that danceable, but his mixing was tight all night and
lots of cool gangsta samples were thrown in. after dancing for about 45
minutes to Dieselboy, i felt like i was going to throw up i was so hot.
the dancefloor area was just a huge furnace, there wasnt much in the means
of ventilation that i could see. i cooled off for a bit outside and went
back up to hear the last couple of tracks that Dieselboy threw down and
then T-1000 came on, spinning some killer detroit tracks. i loved the
first part of his set when he started off with a very minimal set of
beats, and kept very slowly building and building on them...the crowd was
going crazy because they wanted the track to explode but T-1000 kept
adding to it piece by piece until all of a sudden he just exploded and
everyone was moving like crazy. the rest of his set was pretty good, lots
of minimal detroit tracks which i dig and on point mixing. after T-1000
was Titonton's liva pa with the strings section. this was a real highpoint
of the night. i missed the last pa he did with this ensemble at Carbon, so
i was pretty excited to hear what it would sound like and I wasnt
disappointed. the songs ranged from sounding very drifting and dream-like
with jazz/scat style vocals to hard and pounding techno that was very
danceable and got lots of people moving. some of the material was really
so beautiful all i could do was stand there and just listen in awe, it was
truly amazing. after Titonton's pa is where is i get a bit confused. i
know that Derrick Carter didnt show (what the fuck!), so i think
Titonton's pa was a bit longer, and Dan Curtin spun for longer than 1 hour
and then Stefan Manceau started right after Dan Curtin...not quite sure.
i was really looking forward to seeing Dan Curtin (i want his new album,
too bad its import only right now and is around $30), and he spun an
incredible set of pounding hard techno and detroit material. his mixing
was terrific for his entire set, i loved every track he played! i went
outside for awhile to cool off again and came back in to hear the last
couple of tracks he dropped, and then Stefan Manceau stepped up. i was
really impressed by this guy, great material, almost all of it i hadn't
heard before. lots of melodic detroit stuff mixed right in with hard and
deep house, i danced for pretty much his entire set. like greta said, he
seemed to be having some problems at the start of his set as his first few
mixes were off pretty bad, but everything quickly turned around and he had
some mindblowing buildups and rewinds. after his set was over my friend
that i brought didnt want to goto the afterparty, so i didnt get a chance
to see alot of people. all in all, this was a pretty good party. one thing
that annoyed me was the abundance of 13-15 year olds, but i had the most
fun after the crowd started to thin out and the non-ravers went home. i
was also dehydrated, which didnt help with the fact i seemed to be coming
down with the flu, so i've felt pretty bad for the last couple of days. so
big thanks to ele_mental, haiku and spank for throwing another kickin party
with a bomb lineup for such a low price. i cant wait for Titonton to throw
another one :) for those of you heading to erie, pa this weekend i'll see
ya there!

Apologies to anyone who went on April 6 to Sunday School, the 
basskulturekollektive was informed SATURDAY APRIL 5 at 7pm that Sunday 
School was canceled by the management of the three rivers brewing 
company. This left us very little time to retract flyers, e-flyers, word 
of mouth, etc., etc. Again, apologies to anyone who went. Needless to say
don't bother going next weekend.

Peace-

CHRISTIAN VOGEL - (Don't) Take More
Tresor   12MAXI   order#:0227.102.974

Not that he was never there before but CHRISTIAN VOGEL is back and in
his most diverse and impressive form yet. '(Don't) Take More is a
glimpse of what is to come from his third and upcoming album on
Tresor. CHRISTIAN VOGEL has added more fuel to his fire with the help
of two powerful compatriots deep within the UK Underground. Art music
for art people, we say. SI BEGG could very well be England's busiest
producer of the moment. With new recordings out now on at least six
quality European labels and under many different surnames, SI BEGG is
basically exploding. JAMIE LIDELL is a key third of London-based
SUBHEAD trio. Their SUBHEAD project and label have recently stormed DJ
top-tens with six EP's including one with the VOGEL/BEGG imprint
Mosquito.

=================================================================

METAMATICS - A Metamatics Production  (EP01-04)
Clear   CD   order#:0253.019.971 (JUNGLE)

METAMATICS have been producing music since 1992, and with early
interest from labels as far apart as Spymania and Ferox it is clear
that their has already been recognised within dance music's
luminaries. But not satisfied with being recognised for one particular
sound, METAMATICS sighted Clear as the label who could best represent
their broad musical excursions. Tying together the tenuous links that
separate musical genres has always been in our agenda; while some may
tag the concept as 'eclectic', it simply comes naturally to artists
like METAMATICS, challenging dance floors rather than providing fodder
for them. Since the running order we have chosen is based on the tapes
we first received from METAMATICS, it is the way we were first
introduced to their music, and would like other people to share this
with us. Listened to as a whole, the result is a collection of
innovative dance tracks, representative of Clear's commitment to the
very finest in 'electronic' music; from the minimal grooves 'Repeater'
& 'Meander' to the deepest in drum and bass on the opening track
'Swimmer' and 'Raytrax'.

=================================================================

RELOAD - Archive EP
Evolution   12MAXI   order#:0261.036.974

Four tracks combining elements of dub and acid creating.

=================================================================

V/A - Tetragramaton: Submerge
ION   CD   order#:0284.139.971

Tetragramaton' is not your usual break beat compilation one of the
strongest differences is the level of musicanship. There's the
innovative veteran reed player BYARD LANCASTER who has made several
great contributions to modern music.(SUN RA, DAVE BURRELL, FELA KUTI).
GRAHAM HAYNES, son of the legend ROY HAYNES (drummer with JOHN
COLTRANE), has developed his own unique voice on the cornet. His tone
bring to mind the great OLU DARA. His music is a fusion of African &
Indian culture, drum 'n' bass plus all the best elements of modern
jazz. BILL LASWELL has been working in areas of ambient, dub, drum 'n'
bass, experimental hip hop and jazz long before they were genres.
'Active Code' and 'Turn The Screw' by MATERIAL features soloist GRAHAM
HAYNES (cornet) and BYARD LANCASTER (alto saxophone) juxtaposed with
hard drum 'n' bass structures, ambient undertones and thick dub
basslines. Produced and arranged by BILL LASWELL. DJ SOUL SLINGER (of
LIQUID  SKY) contributes one track, calling out his drum 'n' bass and
funk influences and giving a glimpse of the future. Also included is
one track by the much talked prince off Illbient, DJ SPOOKY, with his
personal blend of breakbeat/ambient noise flavor. FULL CONE, formed in
San Francisco by drummer BRAIN (PRAXIS, TOM WAITS, PRIMUS) brings in
the last track with break beat funk in a hip hop dub style.

=================================================================

SUPERGROUP - The Concept album
Fax   CD   order#:0268.037.971 (TRANCE / TECHNO)

This project is the product of many years of (re)creational
psychedelic research and four lifetimes worth of mixing it up on
dancefloors and chillrooms around the galaxy. The SUPERGROUP is THOMAS
BULLOCK, PROF. PHARTIPHUCKBORLZ, CHARLES UZZELL-EDWARDS and MAMMAL.
Fat chunky beats for movie soundtracks.

=================================================================

KOPFUSS RESONATOR - The Whipbird
Nephilim   12MAXI   order#:0246.067.974

KOPFUSS RESONATOR, (aka SPECT R PROD) Got together with 
Spacetraveller and DJ Jrg (aka SHIVA SPACE) TECHNOLOGIE for the first
time create these powerful and futuristic trax. 'The Whipbird' a
sample from  the lush rainforest Australia's will keep the dancefloor
into the move when it comes together with indian kettledrums and
hypnotic bass frequencies. 'The Tripbird' a hard pumping and bombastic
version screams for being played into a psychedelic night set.

=================================================================

USHUAYA - Ushuhaya
High Society   12MAXI   order#:0275.045.974

USHUAYA are TIM SCHULDT (MAMA INDICA, KIND OF INTELLIGIENCE, FOUR
CARRY NUTS) and ATTILIO 'ATTI' INCITTI (Planet House/Cologne). This
new 12' on the A-side another psychedelic killer tune with heavy
guitar sounds and the flipside brings us with '3 Months' a little dark
statement to maybe a goa rave-countdown or something.

=================================================================

V/A - Valis 2: Everything Must Go
ION   CD   order#:0285.139.971

Sonic terrorist BILL LASWELL, who left the beat ruthlessly
assassinated on 'Valis 1:Ceconstruction Of Syntax', rises again from
the realms of sub-bass to give you a glimpse of the other side on
'Everything Must go'. Enter a parallel universe where break beats give
way to broken beats, non linearity is the norm, and the towers of
convention come crashing down  the result of these deep, subterrenean
detonations. This Double CD, 25 track sert features the vanguard of
the coming era.TRACKLISTING: CD 1: BILL LASWELL w/DXT -  33, BABU - In

ok kids, something i been mulling around for a day or so. i don't want to
point fingers or get personal so i will keep this kinda generalized...

the gist of my complaint is this: i got flyers for a party (yes i admit i
was passing em around at indigo, before i read em, i love passin out flyers
coz it gives me a reason to talk to and meet ppl, those of you who know me
know i am very nonsocial; but i digress...), they're heavy guage with a
high gloss, near laminate finish,  5 dj's, only of who's names i've heard
are 2 locals, $10...friday i paid $10 to se goodwill, titonton, dan
curtain, deiselboy....2 weeks prior, i paid $10 to see carlos, morgan
geist, titonton, perry ellis, and haiku...2 weeks prior to that i paid $9
to see kingsize, billeebob, phantom 45, jay denham, paris mack, shira khan,
spine, brian gillespie, doormouse, midi slut and dreamcycle...all of which
took place at very clean, warm, non-warehouse type buildings with running
water clean, permanent, bathrooms. now, please...i personally dare someone
to rationalize $10 or more for a lineup that is mostly locals (talented
maybe, but still local, no airline or hotel cost) and a national act or two
(known or unknown).......


peace and love,
chris

Subject: {pb-cle} Tribal Gathering Net Meet
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey There,

This is Jammin James E. from Washington DC. Several of us DC netravers are
takin a little trip to merry old England to attend this years Tribal
Gathering. Its going to be held at the Luton Hoo Estates in Luton, England
from 12 noon, Saturday, May 24 through 9 AM Sunday, May 25.

Performers include, well, just about everybody - Kraftwerk, Orbital, Daft
Punk, Way Out West, Juno Reactor, Jeff Mills, Plastikman, DJ Shadow, Sasha,
Digweed, Sid Shanti, Dougal, Hype, and Garnier just to name a few. For a
full listing of performers, tents, and times, check out
http://www.universe.co.uk/tribal.htm - Its truly awe-inspiring.

Anyway, a few of us were dancin it up last week, when the thought occurred
that we should set up a Tribal Gathering Net Meet, organizing a place at
Tribal Gathering where us "netraving colonists" could congregate and share
hellos. It could also serve as a place to regroup if people get separated,
("The one occurrence sure to happen to everybody," as one Tribal veteran
stated), as well as a place where those highly evolved UK-Dance
subscribers, if they were so inclined, could meet their American netraving
counterparts.

It appears the rave net-meet/netogether concept is largely of American
make. Many of my closest friends today (and those with which I am traveling
to England) were met through this Internet-based communal event. What
better event than Tribal Gathering to enjoy that rewarding social
phenomenon on an international level - A global cyber-tribal gathering.    

With some kindly assistance, it appears the best place to have our Tribal
Gathering Net Meet is within the "Global Village" vending area. Near its
entrance,  there is a smaller tower that proves to be a good meeting place
for the lost and bewildered. My crew will attempt to bring a Tribal
Gathering Net Meet poster of some sort to make us easy to find. Your job is
to seek us out and say "Hello!" 

Based on the current scheduling of performers, it would be criminal to ask
that we try to officially congregate anytime after 10:00 pm. Hence, the
official Tribal Gathering Net Meet time is 8-9 PM, Saturday night - a time
to gather and share good cheer among fellow netters - though the idea is to
have a place where peeps can stop by anytime during the event to meet
fellow electronic dance and communication enthusiasts. Nothin' fancy, just
a meetin' spot for our cyber-tribe!

If your plans include Tribal Gathering this May and you would like to meet
up with your very own rave-nation,  then make sure to come by! If you have
suggestions or comments, feel free to drop me an email at jamese@erols.com.
I will keep a list of us netravers plannin on goin and be happy to update
you on the DC posses plans, etc. Please do not respond to this particular
e-mail, as it has been massively cross-posted to every rave list in
America. Thanks!

Much respect,

Jammin' James E.

i like dares:)
first of all, your attempt to compare the ele_mental cru and haiku's
parties to the average glossy flyered $10 event is ridiculous. also, that
ymca has been used twice now for their parties so they probably found a
really good deal.

   $10 is a fair price for a glossy-flyered party no matter who is spinning
nowadays *ducks* considering the cost of a venue with permits and all that
legit stuff, plus flyer costs (of course glossy flyers cost more but *most*
believe they will draw more of a crowd no matter how much you think it
doesnt matter), promotion man-hours, long distance phone calls, and the
nature of it consuming aspects of your whole life for two (probably more)
weeks. These are all fixed costs. They all add up to what the promoter
thinks the party is worth. Then one can graph a supply curve graphing the
amont of people needed to reach the quota (which should be more than the
budget) for each change in cost.

par example:
you didnt tell us where at all this is, but im assumign its in a suburb
somewhere in ohio. The venue will probably cost $400 , the dj's probably
$500, the sound and lights probably $500 and the flyers probably $200. If
im overestimating, its because im trying to make it fair for the promoters
in question, who deserve to at least break even. In any event, thats $1600
party. Its an average budget, but not one worth sacrificing keeping really
lowkey. That means you would *need* 320 kids to show up at $5 and 160 at
$10. Those points define the supply curve, and the demand curve is
determined not only by the dj's that are spinning but is more localized to
the area.this is something you can only estimate from experience of your
own promotional skillz, knowledge of the area's underground population,
what ELSE is going on that night, what EVER goes on in that area, etc.)

so we have to assume that the demand curve intercepts the supply curve at a
point near the $10 equilibrium; meaning that 320 kids probably wont show up
for a $5 party because $5 partys imply small events, but at least 160 would
if it was presented as such..it all depends on the kids attitude about big
events and what else is going on that night, weekend, and month.

o well thats my interpretation, keeping in mind that every little thing
adds up and covering your costs is neccessary, but im putting more energy
into this
post than my anthropology paper so :P

first of all pete, look how you're categorizing parties...glossy flyer
parties and non-glossy flyer parties......"then one can graph a supply
curve."? ok den.....

i didn't wanna point..but, akron

> somewhere in ohio. The venue will probably cost $400 , the dj's probably

the dj's at indigo totalled $4000, i don't have the budget breakdown in
front of me, so i can't comment on the rest of the figures

the sound and lights probably $500 and the flyers probably $200. If

ok, since chris' bitch mode is on, i'll bitch for bit about a flyer i
picked up at indigo. if you thought $10 was bad for a party of locals
and unknowns, read this. its for an event called Sun Love taking place in
columbus on May 24th. the flyer reads as follows:
--
Come celebrate the warming of the Earth at SUN LOVE in Killa-Columbus with
the Daze Boys.

Jungle DJ's:  Odi  -  Blueline  -  Rob Riddum
Break Beat DJ's:  DJ Sun  -  DJ Smoke  -  DJ Anthone  -  DJ Dub

18+(Must bring ID) / *$18* at the door from 10pm until...  614-823-8363
--

not to rip on the lineup, but where the FUCK do these guys get off asking
$18 for this party?! the flyer is very flashy, full color, expensive
looking. as much as i like the idea of an 18+ party, there is no way they
can justify asking $18...maybe since 60% or more of the ravers at your
average party are under 18 they feel they have to charge that much to us
18+ people in order to break even? just from the look of this flyer it has
the same feel as that 'Planet Orange' party that took place in pburgh this
weekend (you know, the one DJ Keoki didnt even show up for), very
commercial and over-promoted. Odi is really the only DJ on this flyer that
i know anything about, and i'm not about to shell out $18 for 6 other
lesser known DJs. this weekend there are two world class lineups taking
place in Erie, PA and Dayton, OH priced at $20 and $17 respectively. these
people need to wake up and realize that a flashy flyer and a high price
aren't going to attract people, certainly not me at least.

bitch mode off :)

i will.

there's many factors when throwing a party that affect ticket price.  
those sound like some damn amazing lineups, even including the elusive 
shira khan!  <smile>  hehe.

the sound system.
the lights.
the venue.
the minor details that make the party go together.

the venue is usually the most expensive... sometimes the sound gets more 
expensive but geez.. someone whom we tried to get a venue from 
charged...get this.... $3000. for a semi-okay venue.  fast forward roller 
rink, madison peeps.

anyhow, those are many factors.  but yet, i think djs overcharge too.  
but thass just me.  well not JUST me. but you know.

:P

january 19 - 1996 - milwaukee wi:

prototype 909
mike dearborn
terry mullan
david hollands
dan efex
synergy
jeff dee
tim krochalk
dj drew

good sound, good lights

it was only $12 - this proves you can throw a quality party and not charge
an arm and a leg.  

overpriced, under produced parties are bullshit !
most promoters these days are either greedy or dont
know how to bargin or budget.
however if you support them you cant complain -
"a fool and their money are soon parted"

i agree with whoever said we have let our standards drop too low.

look for "Sequal" (at last) this spring or summer...

       Did Titonton have any vocals?  I know they were advertised on the
flyer, but I really didn't hear them. But I also was downstairs for the

mike, yep there were some vocals in there, towards the first part of his
set, which probably explains why you didnt hear them :) the vocalist wasnt
singing very loud though, it was hard to make out...i dont think there
were any actual words, just jazzy sort of impromtu type vocals, i dont
really know how to describe it :)

are you sure you don't mean "these people need to wake up and stop attending
lame events with flashy flyers and a high price that keep attracting tons of

sounds more realistic to me...

yes but her levels were a little low unfortunately for some of the
performance.  sound wise it turned out much better than last time at Carbon.
this is due to using pickups right on the violins instead of messing with a
ton of microphones.

first of all chris, look how YOU'RE categorizing parties...$10 parties and
non $10 parties. my previous post was done out of complete ridiculousness
to show how stoopid it is to do this. u *HAVE* to understand that the
equilibrium price is decided on more factors than the demand curve itself,
which is too easy to argue about and very hard to put numbers to, meaning
that the supply curve, which is very easy to figure out (but not with the
information you have given us), has more of a concrete influence on the
price, especially in unurbanized areas. whats around is whats around. also,
the rave business is no different than any other business in the sense that
the producers need to cover their costs! granted, some are better at
bargaining and finding deals than others, does that make their parties
suck? maybe, but then we shouldnt be passing those flyers out now should
we? its your call. i dont give a fuck anymore.

Yeah... I think you can really say you've made it (as a DJ or producer)
when you don't get offers to play in which you're told our budget and
schedule are pretty tight, but we'd love to have you here... When you're
big they call your agent and ask how many bottles of Champagne and what
kind of caviar you need in the limo. Hey... Anyone into throwing a relly
expensive house party and we'll get a big limo and really expensive food
and drinks and stuff... I know the perfect venue and I'll rent it to you
for only $2000 a night. ;>

i was trying not to be too overly critical, but yeah your right,
especially about 'attracting tons of attendess'...i'm sure lots of people
will see the $18 price tag, not know much about the DJs or the promoters
involved, but assume theres going to be SOMETHING there worth $18,
otherwise they wouldnt be asking that much, right?? these are also the
same people that bitch the next day about how they got ripped off for $18
the night before. ow well...

to answer the question more definitively, the vocalist for titonton's live
performance was leah hoover.  she sung in syllables (i don't know the
musical term for it) that are related to jazz/scat but have more to do
with the classical minimalism of composers such as meredith monk and
philip glass.  and yes her voice was subdued in the mix (a little too
much, actually), but it was meant more as a complement to the music and
not as "singing" anyway.  also, in case anyone's keeping score, the string
players were ian jesse (violin) and vince scaccatti (viola). 

titonton would like to thank everyone who came out to both of his HAIKU
events, INTIMATE and INDIGO.  he's very appreciative of those of you who
enjoyed the live shows by morgan geist and himself.  in case anyone hasn't
figured it out yet, each of the HAIKU events were basically just an excuse
to highlight a special live performance, smack dab in the middle of the
party.  it's titonton's way of emphasizing the music, and the creative
prcesses behind it, over everything else.  and in that sense i think we
succeeded--it's all part of the ele_mental mission.

sorry to anyone whose "flow" got interrupted, but if those of you who
actually payed attention and listened were as well rewarded as _i_ was,
then we've gotten one step closer to what we're trying to achieve.

again, thanks.

That's all right.  I'm limited to hours of practise time on my rig at 
home, as opposed to actually spinning for people.  :)

I know!  The word 'superstar' seems to have some baggage attached to it: 
"I'm a god so I can do whatever I want, which includes blowing off my 
gigs."  Sheesh...  why not keep it local, so you KNOW that everything 
will be cool?

I guess not.  After a certain nameless magazine declared it 'dead, but 
there's this great new style called electronica out there...'  :)

Illbient is cool as drek, but I don't think they is any one future.  
There's too many possibilities out there for any one style to be 'it.'  
Me, I'm still hooked on German trance and hardcore.  Therein lies my future.

ed, if my classical piano background serves me correctly, i think the
musical term is 'arpeggios', which are a sort of musical scales or cords.
although i could be wrong, its been awhile :)

I get a little suspicious, when a party has a 25 dollar cover and a flier
that is like 1 X 3 ft and in like 16 colors...being a design student I
have had to painfully learn the cost of printing, and when I see a big
stack of these things I realize that Im paying for the flier as much as
anything else. and the worst part is that these fliers are usually
horribly designed!(like there over production is going to make up for a
lack of artistic talnet) some of the best fliers I have seen are like 6 or
7 inches on the long side and are four color seperation jobs.

pay no attention to this. how many times do people have to post these
stupid chain letters before they catch on? viruses cannot be spread
through e-mail. they can only get on your computer if you download a file
from somewhere.

IT is Impossible to  Contract a virus  through e-mail unless you are
opening programs that are attached....
The subject line cannot be a virus...what was the size of the
e-mail...surely a 3kb message cant be hiding a program in it ,now can it,
because a virus is an executable program....

Well, stella wong is a guy... *does sideways wave with her hand*
db's jungle was really nice ;)

titonton (shuts up because i've been yelled at enough already)

after about then, we left... i had fun, given the circumstances, and payed

HI!!!!
Reading all these posts pisses me off!!!!!  Okay, do you guys know how
much DJ's cost???? Wink $3500 , Sneak $20000, DRC $1000!!!! These are
just a few BIG names, and on top of these prices are flight and
hotel!!!  Flyers are not cheap at all!!!! Actually this is what kills.

The thing that makes me the maddest about people complaining is that my
crew, Collective Intelligence, try to have a good party.  WE DO NOT CARE
about making money.  We just want to break even.  We use all the profit
to throw a better party.  

This  is my beef.  Three clean nice spaces have been ruined because of
the last 3 parties in Columbus, The Return of Superfly, Indigo, and
Intimate.

It is so hard to find spaces.  The loss of these spaces really
discourages me.  At Afros, we had to REPLACE the carpet because of
ciagarette burns!!!! Can we all try harder to work with the promoter and
not against them!!!!

Also, Sun LOve is there first party. Please don't hold a ban on this.  A
lot of crews try and a lot don't stick around.

Throwing parties is hella work.  Have any of you thought that there is 4
trips needed for out of town DJ's??? 

>From airport to hotel, hotel to party, party to hotel, and hotel to
airport.  That is alot of running!!!

I love doing this but it can get frustrating.

Thanx, 
MELISSA

Actually I've been beta testing it for about a month (ever since Memphis 
build 1399).  I dunno, neat idea, but kinda slow (and it's not my 
machine, I have a Pentium 200 w/48M SDRAM).  HTML'ized everything is 
nifty, but what happens when HTML standards change?  Time for an OS 
Update.  Plus when I surf, I wanna use the full screen, not have a 
"frame" off to the left--sure you can resize it--but I don't want to have 
to, just to surf.  It's a nifty concept--probably mostly because it's 
new.  I'm still not convinced it's "better" tho.  Also, traditionally 
Netscape has been able to put out new releases faster than Microsoft.  

Besides, I don't believe Microsoft should take over the world :)  
Netscape will remain my fave :)

Peace!

i don't understand why my post pissed you off? collective is a very
straight crew and you could tell you cats use the money you make for better
future parties, at least i could tell that from talking to walt and other
ppl about the collective shows

superfly i don't know, i heard shit but i cannot say anything first hand
because i was out of town, but intimate and indigo i did go to and both we
stayed to help clean up, all i can say is indigo and intimate venues were
not lost because there were parties there, the ymca cats came back early in
the morning and were overwhelmed by how many ppl came. and a few things
that the titonton or lainey in no way could've prevented, 

but, thats my opinion
 
peace,
chris

post script: i love collective parties and hope to meet you melissa..i
wonder if i already know you in person, but not by name......

     I've lost track with an old friend who's involved in the Pittsburgh
scene.  Her name is Lisa E and I heard she lives in Oakland or Shadyside
- anyone??  Last word was she was dating some DJ named Kevin.

An addendum, to what I just asked:

I was thinking of DJ SPooky the Subliminal Kid, who I'm sure is from the
ill-bient scene; I think there's another DJ Spooky who does
dub/trip-hop. Or maybe they're both the same; but if not, which one is
Ben Neill? Or, to make the question simpler, what does DJ Spooky/ Ben
Neill do?

Thanks for clearing it up.

Ok, that said, my question is:  Why do promoters make such a big deal out
of huge ass flyers and huge ass dj's? The way I see it, I would much
rather support local dj's than help contribute to some big name dj's 2000
dollar price tag.  I'm not trying to say that big names are bad, because
alot of them are great... I just don't see the need to spend so much money
on flyers and dj's that you have to jack prices up so high.. But then
again, I'm no promoter and I've never been on that side of the coin...

No way! That's crazy. Btw, my girlfriend and I trekked out for Afros, and
it was one of the best times I've had at a party :) Big up's to you guys!

Actually (this may just be some old hacker myth...) I believe there
actually is a way to physicaly destruct a harddrive by making it write
funny, or spin too fast, or some wierd thing like that...I've also heard
that a monitor can be destroyed by making it focus it's beam (whatever
that thing that makes the pictures on the screen is called :)  onto one
pixel so that it burns itself out or something.  I've never actually seen
anything like this though, but it's interesting.  It'd be really scarey if
it really could be done though, computers just blowing up randomly all
over the place...   :)

first off, this isnt a flame. i mostly agree with what you have to say but
i have related things to bitch (at length) about too.

your opinion stated here is exactly why your first post didnt make much
sense to me. if you "would rather support local dj's than help contribute
to some big name dj's 2000 price tag," then you wouldnt be bitching about
that akron party with mostly akron dj's and comparing price tags to
completely differently budgeted lineups and venues. the local dj's AND
promoters need to be paid too. thats all i was trying to get at. if the
local guys dont get supported theyll go off representing your town without
you knowing what theyre all about. but i digress.

heres my beef: why the hell is it the "in" thing to do for bigger name dj's
to skip out on bigger parties? for example: keoki at planet orange (which
btw had to go through two court settlements to happen thanks to moon
township residents) and frankie bones at delphi. i have a problem with dj's
so conveniently "missing the plane" for whatever reason such as "i dont
like the way its all commercialized." or "i dont like him using my name
like that" or "that promoter is just in it for the money."

what the fuck? if one agree's to spin at a certain time for the desired
amount of $$, they better be there or at least give the guys notice that
they wont be with significant amount of time to revamp the lineup
appropriately. no one likes to pay for a dj they wont get to see for awhile
and find out he's not showing up.

ive been on the opposite side of the coin having to tell dj's they cant
spin because things have fell through, but honestly thats just as
devastating to me as it will ever be for the guys i wouldve paid. if youre
organizing an event, you have that power. simple. but if a dj is asked to
perform services in a event theyre not actively planning, they have the
choice to not show up, but for them to think they are performing a better
service to the rave community by not showing up is way off base in my
opinion, because its making the promoter look just as bad if not worse. iF
djs like this ever listen to advice, they shoould be told "If you dont want
to be involved in professional type event organization for the masses, dont
charge $2000 for a set cause thats the only kind of gigs you can be
afforded at." doesnt it also make sense that dj's with big price tags
should keep a good reputation among promoters with big budgets who provide
lots of cute lil rave kids who pay to see them so they can tell everyone
else how good they were?? sheeeesh!

im obviously missing something in current dj logic. can anybody answer
these questions? do they want more power than they have in the rave scene
and want their ego's to be known that well? or are they already rich enough
to not think about how they are going to make a living when their rave days
are over? or are they scared that they cant perform well under hyped
conditions that theyve so eagerly awaited since they bought their first
records and fell in love with them in their basements? i have no clue. it
seems so cankerous to deal with high rolling performers who forget who
keeps them alive. sure, they dont NEED that $2000 honoraria, but the
sponsors are putting trust in them to deliver what theyre worth.


i have much more respect to the organizers of big events such as delphi and
planet orange than i will ever have for keoki or frankie bones or anyone
whose up on not supporting big events solely because its so easy to claim
"RIPOFF!" without full knowledge of what your dissing and what your
missing.

And as far your original question about why promoters care about huge
events and lots of money on flyers and dj's goes beyond the money, ChrisS.
Its about big dreams as well as big wallets. kidz like HUGE events with big
dj's and HUGE flyers to hang in their room to remember it. there is a
demand for that, with good reason, and sadly, 3000 people wont show up if
you just circulate an infoline on tiny slips of paper anymore. Without big
ass parties once in awhile the sublime nature of rave fades away and you
start wondering why the fuck youre still hanging around kidz with baggy
pants and tongue rings, and why you so easily paid 60 dollars for those
pants, complaining about $25 you wasted ten hours of pure freedom you cant
remember. honestly if its gonna be an event not to miss and never to
forget, why not spend one of those dollars on a colorful shiney token of
the evening and have braggin rights about how much a certain
dj/promoter/venue sucked? thats what its all about right?? hehe. thought
so.

i hope some of you know what im talking about and to the rest i remind you
this was not typed in ill-nature of anyone in particular in mind.

write to the same sector over and over again. it was a mutatuion engine 
virus called "wolverine". once that sector was killed it went to the next.

if you ever tune an oscilliscope to center, it will burn thru in a few 
minutes.
it's physically damaging if you play with your vga settings to the point 
that you have one line of data...

     Organic - as we've known it for the past few years will actually be
called "Chaotica" this year.
     Chaotica will kick off in July with 5 shows (TBA) followed by 15
more in September.  The show is expected to feature the Chemical
Brothers, Prodigy, FSOL, and Meat Beat.  In addition, another 6-7 acts
are still to be named.
     The concert is supposively being held in sports arenas with a main
stage and a smaller room in the back with a rotating slate of DJ's.  The
DJ's will also be spinning their goods on the main stage before and
in-between acts.  The organizers are looking at a time frame of 9pm-4am
(depending on curfew laws) to showcase the 10-12 groups.

     Sports arenas suck - if it does come to the Burgh' they should play
an outdoor venue.

ok, just as a point of interest in this debate, why don't we compare the
recent failure planet orange to an upcoming party in dc called ultraworld

planet orange                    ultraworld
keoki (who didn't show)            josh wink
crystal method                    rabbit in the moon
various local djs                    ltj burkem
                                         mad talent (like 10 other djs)

price:
$25 at door                        $25 presale, 30 at the door

now I realize that ultraworld is going to be a lot bigger and that means
that it is possible for them to charge less while at the same time
having all these great acts, but how does that look to us, the
"consumers" of raves?

my real motive here is to obsess about how big this party is going to be....

ps:
anyone interested in road-tripping there? you drive, we provide dope
mixtapes + fine company....
I believe the main infoline is (410)637-7665
local tix at slacker (412)381-3911
bus trip info (412)734-5252
(yes, they're providing their own bus service from here to the party!!! 
now _that_ is impressive)

I totaly agree with you, but I wasn't the one bitching about that party in
Akron, I think that was the other chris :)

I think it's because they can..If they do it once, but still get bookings,
they'll do it again and again.  If a dj who does that suddenly wasn't
getting booked anywhere because of a bad rep, he'd hopefully change his
ways

I realize that, I love bringing home flyers, I've got 'em all over my
room.  But I think some of the flyers are way way overdone..like the
posters for fantasia..I wonder how much of a draw posters actually add,
especially when there are also flyers and pre flyers.  I would rather them
spend a little less on 'advertising' and maybe lower the ticket price a
little.  I guess that I'm just used to smaller, less promoted parties..I
moved here from Albuquerque NM and the scene there was smaller and pretty
isolated.  I had seen maybe two flyers from out of town before I moved
here.  The scene here is much more organized and 'professional', which I
think is pretty cool :)

Chris (who is soon going to get himself a sig so he's not confused with
the other chris :)

pete, i was bitching about the high pricetag for parties with local dj's
and the inability for ppl to justify the high price.

in my eyes the high price cannot be justified because of the low price and
phenomenal lineups at the past 6 month's (length of time i been back in
ohio) parties in columbus and the party in youngstown in may, particularly
that party: 8 dj's (all local, but extreme talent) and the price is only
$5.

i figured out a solution to our problem; just as mcdonalds is now required
to post nutritional information i think raves should be required to post a
detailed budget on the infoline so no one can complain about what theyre
paying for without knowing what theyre paying for. :P

There are ways to ruin a hard drive remotely:  Reprogram the drive heads 
to go to a negative track.  Boom, heads hit the furiously-spinning 
spindle, and no more HD.  It's far easier to destroy a floppy drive (the 
heads actually tough the disk surface).

Suppress the vertical and horizontal hold controls in the video card.  A 
variant of this is to trash the tables in the video card (not a graphics 
coder, so I'm sketchy at best on the terminology), which creates an 
uncontrolled beam:  snow crash.  It's easier to do that than it is to 
isolate the interrupts in the video card and wipe them out.

        this needs to be done like the columbus cats do it. maybe we'd see a
lot of promoters scared of this idea, maybe a lot of promoters would think
about what costs warrant higher prices.

I am totally sick of this!  Don't you people realize that the promoters
are doing all this work, taking all this risk and making magic happen so
you can have a good time? 

Promoters barely break even.  Promoters often lose money.  If you go
through with any of these lame ideas, I damned well hope you expect to pay
promoters for their losses too when parties don't break even.

You're like little spoiled children sometimes.  Just pay the $20 or $30 or
$40 dollars, have a great time and focus on contributing something instead
of destroying.  If you can't afford $20 for a party, maybe you need to
find a part time job.

You can't bitch about what a promotor makes on a party because you choose yo=
 pay.  I fits not worth it, then don't go.  I f the price is to high then=
 many peeps will stay home or go to a house party...As an ex- assistant=
 manager at pizza hut a large supreme's total cost to the company including=
 labor and rent and everything is 72 cents.  You Pay 13 dollars.It's too=
 much, but its a business and if I want it then i gladly pay for it, if I=
 don't then I get a Frozen pizza.  The Point is its the businesses decision=
 to charge and yours to pay.  THIS IS FUCKING AMERICA!! An entreprenuer has=
 a right to make mad cash.  Its the american way. Trust me,a promotor never=
 banks (in general), unless the party is a tremendous success.  How good is=
 $3000 Dollars when we constantly fight the odds against, cops, bitchin=
 ravers, weather, no-show or wasted DJ's,crooked promotors, and put our=
 asses on the line for you and dedicate 3-6 months on one event. Think about=
 it, 3months is 12 weeks 3000/12=3D250. 250 aweek!!! Thats fukkin modest for=
 someone who goes through the trouble and 24 hour stress that we do.  I know=
 i do it for you guys!!, I may live in Dallas, but i used to live in=
 Cleveland.  i would've done it for you guys.  but all you can do is=
 complain..ehat a shame. That'swhy i quit throwing badass parties in Dallas=
 and now im a sys administrator for a web server.  I make twice that a week=
 and no one bitches and im not doinwhat i truly love, and the kids are bored=
 on Saturdaymore often, bitchin about the good parties being gone, cause=
 they didn't wanna pay $14 to Sasha and John Digweed, or if you want to see=
 what really happens sometimes take a serious look at this=

ahh seems like we caught a loose circuit on someone!
if you read any of my previous posts branden, they are from a promoters
perspective, and i stated on numerous occasions that promoters do deserve
to get paid. but at the same time, whats to stop the consumers from being
shafted, manipulated into believing false concepts of the same nature that
most of us are trying to avoid? i dont see any point in throwing an event
that couldnt be enjoyed without a profit. promoters without capatalistic
migrains (i assure you there are a lot) dont mind sharing the details of
their budget to those concerned.

At both Intimate and Indigo in columbus you were given a small flyer with
a set list and budget when you paid, which I thought was great

these are the directions as best i know them

any problems call justus at 937.496.4511


from the E or W take 70 to 75 S to dayton, find 35 E (xenia), get off at
KEOWEE ST

from N or S take 75 to dayton, find 35 E (xenia) and get off at KEOWEE ST

at the end of the ramp take a L and you'll see the space right there, the
boys and girls club

this space has not been used in about a year and a half, if not more, it's
always been one of my favorite places to party.  3 rooms of sound, very
clean, and lots of places to hang out.

don't forget to come see us in the basement, i'm spinning in the
ambient/abstract room down there

(apologies if the direcs from the S are wrong, i only know that exit
coming from the N)

Well, I've been reading the postings lately, and I figured that the idea
dropped about posting the budgets for parties was a good one sooo......

I hope you will find the following list explanation enough on why we need
to charge $35 for 3 full nights of partying!! (that is 3 seperate full
fledge parties, so splitting it up, that's $11.60 a night!)

Here we go......
SECURITY                        $ 3500.00 (ALL THREE NIGHTS)
PORTA POTTIES                   $ 1000.00
LIGHTING                        $20000.00 (FOR ALL THREE NIGHTS)
LASERS                          $ 6000.00 (ALL THREE NIGHTS)
SOUND                           $ 6000.00 (SAT ONLY)
SOUND                           $ 1000.00 (FRI AND SUN ONLY)
SPACE                           $ 3000.00 (FRI AND SUN ONLY)
SPACE                           $ 8000.00 (SAT ONLY)
SPACE IMPROVEMENTS TO MEET CODE $ 2500.00
FIRE WATCH PERMIT               $  600.00
ELECTRICAL PERMIT               $  240.00
POWER CITY ELECT. (INSPECTION)  $  250.00
DANCE HALL PERMIT               $  150.00
DJS & PAS                       $18800.00 (ALL THREE NIGHTS)
FLIGHTS                         $ 8700.00
MISC. EXPENSES                  $ 2000.00
FLYER MAIL OUTS                 $ 1000.00
FLYERS                          $ 6000.00 (INCLUDING PRE FLYERS)
TRAN.FOR DJ'S TO/FROM PARTY     $ 1000.00 (PAYING PEOPLE/RENT VANS)
FOOD FOR OUT OF TOWN DJ         $ 1000.00 (ALL THREE NIGHTS)

FOR A TOTAL OF..................$90,740.00 - - -

ADD 10% FOR EMERGENCIES
AND FORGOTTEN EXPENSES, THE GRAND TOTAL IS------$99,814.00
(ALL GOOD PROMOTERS SHOULD DO THIS, IT LETS YOU HAVE A BIT OF A LE-WAY SO
THAT YOU DON'T UNDER ESTIMATE YOUR BUDGET, AND THEN END UP BROKE AND SAD!!)

NOW DIVIDE THE $35 PRICE INTO THE MIX AND ----- WE NEED 2851 PEOPLE TO
BREAK EVEN!!!!!!

So I think paying $35 for $99,814 of entertainment is worth it.
I hope you do as well!

Also, please understand that I would not want to see a party of this scale
every week, that's why we do only one big show a year. In between 420's you
will find Psychoactive and Spawntaneous doing lots of smaller shows, and
pricing them from $5 to $20 and anywhere in between!!

I hope this list helped you understand what goes in to an event of this
size, and this list just reperesents the monatary side of the event, there
are countless hours of meetings with each other, the city, the sound,laser
and lighting crews, the security. There are space walk-throughs with all
mentioned above. Then there's the whole space conversion from a old cold
empty warehouse , to a big beautyful party!! This can include cement work,
plumbing, paint scraping, moving mass amounts of useless shit, to clear a
floor for you, the people to shake ya booties on!!

So anyway, enough explaining, I hope to see lots of smiling faces at the show,
and I hope this helped clear any bad thoughts from people's heads,

Peace & respects,

Stephen (Sleepy C) Cinch

kind of a review of platonic love :/

Randy/Pr0zac (*waves*/*hug*/=]) + i went to platonic love in erie, PA
(??is that the midwest or not?? well who cares, i'm still writing this
:]) last nite... the space was this bingo hall sort of place. it was 
very big + clean. there were SO many lights, the lighting was by 
lovelight & i didn't even know they had 1/2 that many. there was this
big inflated parachute-cloth alien-head behind the stage (weird/cool). 
the sound was loud =D and clean. =D

when we got there, johny fiasco was on + was spinning trancey hard
house, not really what i like. then stacie pullen went on + we were
expecting something more like detroit but he played hard house too,
although it got better toward the end. the next DJ spun harder detroit
techno :] & he seemed maybe disappointed at times at his mixing, but
it wasn't bad + his tracks were slammin. =] but i didn't know who he 
was so afterward i went up to him + asked him what his name was & he
says felix da housecat, i told him i liked your set good job. in the
midst of this the sound had to be turned down, =[ i heard there were
noise complaints since there was a residential district right next to
it. so the detroit DJs are spinning house & vice versa (they keep ya
guessing!) but wait! things get weirder. 

then robert armani went on + about 3 records later, all power quit, he
grabbed his records + disappeared. i heard quiet voices saying "it's a
raid!" suddenly the lights were on & there were cops all over. some
idiot on the dancefloor (he wasn't a cop) yelled "you're all under
arrest", uh yeah that's intelligent, funny joke. suddenly i found
randy + we grabbed our stuff & went out to the car + got in. then we
realized neither of us was anywhere near ok to drive (not to mention
being surrounded by cops which doesn't help things). eventually randy
said he'd have to drive, and somehow i eventually figured out we were
going back to the map point & where it was, although i don't think
either of us remembers this happening. (scary =o) 

we ended up inside the map point/record store somehow. at that point i
think i was more confused than i have ever been in my life before, if 
i saw any of you there then & did not realize who you are i'm sorry. 
=] anyway the party was going on in the back room & robert armani was
on + i have no idea what he spun or how he did, just that whatever i
heard sounded really good, that's how confused i was. =/ then john 
aquaviva went on (by that time i was a little closer to reality). in
the middle of his set though, there was a changeover to a bigger
soundsystem. i think he had some problems with mixing here + there but
that might have been because of speakers being moved past him all the
time + being connected, or maybe not. well disco house is so much fun
anyway! *discoes around* =D =D but about the last 1/2 of his set was
like more technoey sort of tracks, which was all right but it was weird
because he usually only plays discoey stuff. next was robert de la
gautier. i had never heard him before, he spun hard detroit techno. it
was really fun insane music with even insaner mixing that makes you
want to dance + jump up + down & scream. i wonder where he gets his
records. the craziest record though was the 1 that goes (yes it said
this) "shave your pussy", which i would have liked had its disturbing
subject matter been almost any other subject. it had these bizarre
distorted samples from a porno or something. after him was alexi
delano. he started off with this kind of chilled out techno like with
ambient sounds all over even though a lot of the people left there
were still dancing, + only later moved into harder tracks. by the way
thanks to keane (*wave*/=]/*hug*) for helping me evade cops! that's my
review, randy do you have any input? who else was there?

np: house party 5/gizmo + buzz fuzz + dano + the prophet 
(what's your pleasure? thebox. thebox. GIVE ME THAT BOX!!!) =D

i went to platonic love as well.  loved the lights and the alien  
thing.  anyhow, i was quite upset about the cops showing up because,  
as Greta said, a lot of people were not ok to drive.  anyhow, she  
covered the main aspects of the party, so i'm not going to repeat  
everything, but they did a pretty good job setting up at the second  
site, all things considered.  finally, i must say thanks to a lot of  
people for helping me get there in the first place, so thank you  
Aized, Ryan, Scott, and Courtney. 8-)  the line up was great, and it  
was all in all a nice party.

hmmmm.....


i thought this party wasn't promoted enough and that's why i'm
suspecting that was one of the main reasons a lot of peeps weren't
there.  too bad because i thought this party was awesome...a lot better
than planet orange
and alot cheaper.                                                       
              

anyways, it was at the washington county park area and i must say the
promoters did a nice job of the space.  there was crazy lasers and the
floor was nice and clean and they even had a big screen projection area
where they were showing mortal combat.  anyways, it was a shame that not
a lot of ppl were there because the place looked really empty.  too bad
because in my opinion i thought the music was really really good....some
of the best shit i've heard in pittsburgh.  


music wise, roc raida was awesome.  i guess he showed up late so some
other guy came on but i though he was really good.  kevin was also
really good too. but roc raida just kicked ass...he was doing all the
crazy shit you see him on the DMC videos and i guess they turned on all
the lights so you could see what he was doing...oh yeah, does anyone
know what crew those breakers are from?  they were decent...not a lot of
power moves but nice foot work.
in the big room, there was a somewhat live performace by spawn.  how
comes they weren't on the flyer?  i thought they were awesome...the best
part of the night.  yeah, dante was also kicking some shit up too...sine
was decent.  i really enjoyed his set and the old school hip-hop at the
end was fun...i don't know who spun that.

so i guess that's it.  although there was a lack of people i really
enjoyed myself.  the music was good and the spot was good.  



peace out,
amy
 


p.s. did anyone watch the news about raves?  i guess they interviewed
the promoter of horizon and he had his mom attend, hired security who
was searching everyone and he said that 16 of the 18 dollars went to a
homeless shelter.  i thought that was really cool.  they also showed
clippings of planet orange and that thing...

	Horizon    It was a really good time for all the kids that came out
to support.   I do think it could have used some more promotion, but I
know the promoters were busy and could have used more support.
		The HIp-hOP was a great thing to see.  I'd
	like to see more of it at other parties.  It brings out a entirely
different crew, which is cool.  That room had its own vibe... nice.

	The main room was empty, which gave everyone much dance space.

			GOOD I GUESS.
All the acts were fine.  The lighting was minimal.  The sound had one 
problem, but I heard it was a faulty cord brought by the live act.

		who cares.  it ended up ok in the end.


	Happy B-day  DJ Atom

Just thought I'd come in with a few comments.  Didn't make it to Horizon
(school work and sad stuff), but would have liked to.  But, i think they
had pretty good promotion, in terms of flyers.  I'v seen hundreds of them
all over the place.  One thing though that I thought was weird is that I
heard that there was something shady about the promoters.  I had no basis
for judgement for myself.  Then I heard that the party was actually 100%
clean (cool by me).  I didn't not go based on rumors, but I wouldn't doubt
other kids did.

I think this is a cool thing.  There seems to be a major trend of merging
hip-hop and 'rave' culture to a greater extent.  It brings together a
bigger variety of people.  Plus, there aren't that many hip-hop events on
a regular basis in pgh (that I know about at least).  For some hardcore
ravers, though, I can see the incorporation of straight-up hip hop as a
turn off.   For example, I'v heard about as much hip-hop as hardcore
(and I'm a hardcore freak) this year at "raves".  
Does it bother me?
Nope.
I just like to see *all* styles represent.
Hip-hop, trance, breaks, house, hardcore, ambient, jungle, techno,
illness, pudding-pops, moon-cubes and whatever else...

Nuff of that tangent. :)

well heres my version of platonic love in erie, pa :)

greta and i got to the party at about 11, it was in a community
center/bingo hall that was really huge, nice high ceilings, tons of
dancefloor, lighting, and speakers. there were even a couple of stacks in
the back of the space so it was pretty loud all over (which i guess was a
bad thing). anyways the setup was really nice looking, the dj stand was up
pretty high so you could be about anywhere on the main dancefloor and see
the dj. one complaint: no re-entry to the space. i suppose i understand in
certain situations but i didn't understand why they needed it here. we got
there in time to see the last part of Johnny Fiasco's set, like greta said
commonplace hard house, not bad but nothing special. next up was Stacey
Pullen. he started out his set with the same samples used in his mix lp in
the 'DJ Kicks' series, so i was expecting a scorching set of hard detroit,
instead it was more hard house (couple of diva tracks too) with a few
overplayed (but good) detroit tracks thrown in towards the end. at this
point i'm pretty much out of it for all of Felix Da Housecat's set, but he
actually ending up spinning a tracky detroit set (according to greta). hmm
then Robert Amarni came on for a bit when i heard the sound go off. it had
been turned way down a couple of times before and there were a few sound
problems so i didnt pay much attention, then i notice there is a lot of
commotion, look around and the place is crawling with cops. everyone is
yelling and kinda freaking out, i sure was.

since this place was right in a residential area there were numerous
noise complaints, and after giving a couple of warnings they shut it
down forcibly. we went back to my car and just chilled for a minute and
tried to figure out what to do next. driving was out of the question but
since there were cops all over making everyone leave, we didnt have much
of a choice. we somehow made it back to the map point (IQ Records) and
figured out that the party was actually going on in a very bizare back
room that looked like an old bar or restaurant. everything was set up and
going except for all of the speakers when we got there, but they got the
full setup going at towards the beginning of John Aquaviva's set and it
sounded pretty good. Robert Amarni's set was really good, i was confused
too so i just kinda stood there and didnt pay much attention for awhile.
then when John Aquaviva got ready to go on the place was pretty much going
crazy. there was a great vibe at the space, i was just happy the party was
going on. John opened with some kinda hard house, then got right into his
full out booty-disco-house craziness that we all love him for. this one
one of the most fun sets i've ever got a chance to see, it was great
seeing him in a small intimate space with a thick vibe, he was talking
with the crowd and just got everyone into it. after he played out his
disco selections he moved right into some pounding hard hard house which i
didnt expect but really got into.

up next was Robert de la Gautier from germany, and for me this set was the
highlight of the night. first of all he was just an extremely cool guy,
during his entire set he was going crazy dancing, yelling, giving people
from the crowd hi-fives and just making everyone go nuts! he really knew
how to get everyone involved and it payed off in a huge way, everyone was
moving so hard to his set. he played some killer deep and hard house and
lots of detroit tracks i've never heard before, in fact almost all of his
set was material i've never heard before (guess he gets his records in
germany?) yep the "i'm a pussy shaver" track was insane, it had an
oldschool synthesized voice (al la War Games) along with some porno
samples, this record was crazy! half of the people laughed and the other
half just stood there and didn't know what to make of it, but i think
everyone got a huge kick out of it, and Robert seemed to enjoy playing it,
in fact i believe he kissed the record after taking it off the turntable.

Alexi Delano spun out some mindblowing deep trance which built upon itself
until the tracks exploded into really fast and deep house, by this point
we were pretty tired and just listened to this set, but it was great. 

the thing i liked the most about this party was the 2+ hour extended sets
(i think Robert de la Gautier's was closer to 3 although i could be
wrong). it really gave the djs a chance to show what they could REALLY do,
much more of an experience than just listening to a few tracks being
thrown down, i've love to see more parties like this. all in all a very
fucked up but great time in erie. wow this is pretty long...

        ahhh, 1st off, PROPS PROPS PROPS PROPER to the promoters for havin
the fore-sight to have the second spot ready. they kept the vibe goin and i
was impressed and had a good tyme  :)

        general remarks:

        not loud enuff (sorry, das my opinion. maybe everyoone else is used
ta soft parties, but yo ears should be ringin when ya leave the spot).

        the UK DJ showed up all the US dj's in terms of technical skills. he
blew me mind. he didn't give me any vibe tho. so i think he should tsay here
to the point he plays with a STYLISTIC vibe, and US dj's should go over
there to get the technique down (no disrespect intended to any one)

        good party, lotsa new pps. lots of pps dat couldn't dance. but das okay.


        PS, you're welcome gretagrrrrrl. anytime  ;)


        PLUR, 
                keane

>>Author unknown (I think):
>>
>>>It started out innocently enough.  I began to think at parties now and
>>>then to loosen up.  Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and
>>>soon I was more than just a social thinker.
>>>
>>>I began to think alone - "to relax," I told myself - but I knew it
>>>wasn't true.  Thinking became more and more important to me, and
>>>finally I was thinking all the time.
>>>
>>>I began to think on the job.  I knew that thinking and employment don't
>>>mix, but I couldn't stop myself.
>>>
>>>I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and
>>>Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, "What
>>>is it exactly we are doing here?"
>>>
>>>Things weren't going so great at home either.  One evening I had turned
>>>off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life.  She spent that
>>>night at her mother's.
>>>
>>>I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker.  One day the boss called me
>>>in.  He said, "Skippy, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but
>>>your thinking has become a real problem.  If you don't stop thinking on
>>>the job, you'll have to find another job."  This gave me a lot to think
>>>about.
>>
>>>
>>>I came home early after my conversation with the boss.  "Honey," I
>>>confessed, "I've been thinking..."
>>>
>>>"I know you've been thinking," she said, "and I want a divorce!"
>>>
>>>"But Honey, surely it's not that serious."
>>>
>>>"It is serious," she said, lower lip aquiver.  "You think as much as
>>>college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so if
>>>you keep on thinking we won't have any money!"
>>>
>>>"That's a faulty syllogism," I said impatiently, and she began to cry.
>>>I'd had enough.  "I'm going to the library," I snarled as I stomped out
>>>the door.
>>>
>>>I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with a PBS
>>>station on the radio.  I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the
>>>big glass doors... they didn't open.  The library was closed.
>>>
>>>To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that
>>>night.
>>>
>>>As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering for
>>>Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye.  "Friend, is heavy thinking
>>>ruining your life?" it asked.  You probably recognize that line.  It
>>>comes from the standard Thinker's Anonymous poster.
>>>
>>>Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker.  I never miss
>>>a TA meeting.  At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last
>>>week it was "Porky's."  Then we share experiences about how we avoided
>>>thinking since the last meeting.
>>>
>>>I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home.  Life just
>>>seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.

'Around The World' by Daft Punk. i think Robert Armani spun it before the
party was busted and then John Aquaviva opened his set with it. John also
played the sample from the start of 'Revolution 909' which was pretty
funny considering what happened earlier that night. i was waiting all
night for someone to drop Da Funk but no one did, ow well.

I don't know of anyone setting a net meet yet......but it sounds like you
just did. All that we need is a time and a place (the space for the main
party is going to be pretty damn big, but we can figure something out). Any
ideas people?

        We got down to Dayton around 11:30, we had a little problems finding
the location. The spot was a boys & girls club. It was a cool spot. They had
three rooms set up. The main room was in the gym. They were playing alot of
housy, trancy stuff in here (and believe it or not I even heard some
bluegrass?).  They kept turning the lights on in here though. I guess it was
because Dayton has a really strong curfew law and they wanted the lights on
so they could try and find minors. Either way it kept fucking up the vibe
when the lights kept coming on (more on this later). The second biggiest
room was up the stairs and down the hall from the gym. It looked like a rec
room with ping pong tables and such. This was the jungle/hip-hop room.
Titonton and Divine fucked up some shit!!!! I can't really describe what
kind of muzik it was, but it didn't sound like jungle as advertised on the
flyer. Both of them did alot of scratching, and Titonton was up to his usual
antics (working the fader with his chin, gettin up on the table and
scratching with his mouth?). After Titonton and Divine some very tall guy
with a Wu-Tang shirt got on and layed down a phat ass hip-hop set. He was
doing alot of scratching also. And he was playing alot of good cuts that I
like. Can anyone help me out with his name? The third and smallest room was
right next to the jungle room and this was the ambient room. This room was
carpeted and was perfect for chilling in. This room got shut down half way
through the night because someone was smoking in it.  I think it was right
when Lunar was about to go one for his set and I didn't get to see him
(which is something I really wanted to do!). Throughout the whole night they
were on the intercom in the main room and in the hallway.  They were telling
people to keep moving and not to hang out in the halls. I really don't
understand this because at pretty much every party I have been at there has
been people chilling in the hallway. Sometimes people just want to get away
from the muzik and chill, or talk or whatever. And it was really cold so
they couldn't go outside. And in the main room there was somone talking over
the muzik. From what I could pick out he was saying if your blocking someone
in. At first I thought it was some kind of vocals but when it when on for a
while I went out and checked my van to make sure it wasn't getting toed. I
was getting alot of weird vibes from people at this party and didn't feel
comfortable for some reason. And I also felt like nobody had any control of
the party, not he cops or the promoters. I really don't like making
judgements on one party but I don't think i'll be back to Dayton again.

thanks for the replies about that record

does anybody know anybody in new york city who has some floor space
where i can crash? i'm going to be there april 24-28 on a field trip 
+ need a place to stay from thurs nite to sun nite. it doesn't matter
if they live someplace small (i heard everwhere is small there, since
i already sent something to nyc-raves), i'll sleep on the kitchen 
floor, i don't care. otherwise i will have to try to afford the ymca
or youth hostel, which might be too much. thanks...

*** REQUESTING PERMISSION TO POST WEEKLY TO YOUR LIST ***

My name is Cosimo Valela`.  I am in charge of Orbius Distribution.
We are a company based in Toronto, ON (Canada) and Niagara Falls, NY 
(USA).  We distribute and wholesale recordings to Chain Stores, 
Independent Retail Stores, Dance Specialty Shop, Mail Order 
Companies, and other Distributors around the world. 

We have recently decided to start promoting our catalog and weekly 
new releases to DJs, Record Pools, DJ Agencies, Radio Stations and 
others. We are basically allowing those interested to purchase import 
12" vinyl at wholesale (WE ARE NOT AN ONLINE RETAIL STORE)

Our weekly posts, contain information on new European Imports, with a 
description and product number.  This information does not contain 
any pricing information.  The releases include styles of techno, 
trance, house, nrg, ambient, drum'n'bass, and trip hop.  If the list 
prefers, we would accept posting a weekly reminder notice, with a 
link to our web site.

** We are asking members of your list to discuss the possiblity of 
allowing Haus Media / Orbius to post to the list on a weekly 
basis.  If the group feels our information is inappropriate for 
list members, PLEASE ASK YOUR LIST ADMINISTRATOR TO CONTACT US.

Thank you and we are looking forward to hearing from you.....


Kind Regards

Hello all!

Sleepy C here,
Just writing to tell all interested that we have been working on the space
for the last 3 days (about 12 hours a day!!) to get it ready for Saturday!
Things are looking really good. The voicemail has been blowing up, and
people leaving messages from as far away as texas have said they were
comming!!

We had some of our last meetings with the city, the police and fire crews
and all is looking extreamly well. One official actually said, "This place
looks a little too clean for one of your rave parties, damn last year you
need boots to come to the party!!"

Also this year we have added city run friendly security, to ensure a safe
and bust free event!! This includes security officers and police officers.
They will also be patrolling the parking lot keepin all ya rides safe and
sound.

Just incase you were wondering, Fri & Sun are at the Cleveland Agora. This
space was chosen for it's closeness to saturdays space, it's 100% legal and
it has a sur-charge free ticket master in it!! So you can get your 3 day
pass there Friday!

The main event will take place in a warehouse very close to the Agora!!
Call 216.779.7188 starting thursday for directions!! It is not the same
space as last year, it is much cleaner, and yet maintains the oldskool
warehouse look. ( well it is an oldskool warehouse so .... man it's just
dope!!)

We are spending alot of time ensuring you the best time, your are not just
going to walk into a warehouse with speakers chillin in it, we are (if you
will) transforming the building into "our" space.

Can't wait to see the smiling faces, and hear da bass this weekend!

Peace & respects,
Sleepy C

ps. If you hear any rumors, don't panic, go with your feelings, we know our
skillz and we trust your judgement, so when you get back after the weekend
you can tell anyone who didn't go what a great time YOU had, and let them
tell you about the great time they didn't have!!!

 Remember this if you didn't make it last year, Confuscious say,"you are
alowed one mistake, if you repeate the same mistake, then you have proven
yourself stupid!!"

KEEP IT REAL

I am helping maintain a "Rave/Techno" archive, and I am looking for
media clippings, such as stories in the no-rave media, such as a local
newspaper or a magazine. I am archiving them all and hope to have them
all up in the next 2 months, I have a good amount of articles but I
would love to have more. The articles can be good or bad, it doesn't
matter, altho I would rather have positive articles :)

Also please send the articles to: sulivan@topsecret.net because I do
not have the time to read all the lists and newsgroups that this is
getting posted to.

thank you :)

Hi! 

Anyone going to this and want to arrange a net meet? Even though I
haven't belonged to these lists for vey long, it seems like a cool idea,
since I will probably be talking to most of you at one time or another
in the future. :)

I'll be there all three nights, with two friends of mine from Nebraska
and Iowa, and a sample of the new magazine, HIGH-R FREQUENCIES, I'm
trying to start covering the rave scene in the Midwest (after al the
*true* Midwest includes Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Indiana, etc.,
and there's lots going on out here)

Please, anyone interested, try to reply before Thursday afternoon as I
have to leave by then to get to Cleveland by Friday nite :).

Peace and positivity goin' out . . .

if it's going through ticketmaster, then it probably WON'T get busted, as
ticketmaster would not distribute tickets for a venue that is illegal,
unsafe, doesn't have its permits, etc.

i dont know about the chances of it getting busted, but i DO know that
spawntaneous and psychoactive threw 720 (which was phat btw) smoothly using
ticketmaster without it getting busted, so i believe if it does get busted
it wouldnt be soley because of the exposure ticketmaster gave them.

Well for one, I don't think that tickets would be sould thru ticketmaster
if there was any chance of the party being busted.  Two, after going to
many of his other parties including last years 420, I think Steve knows
what he's doing...in other words, I wouldn't worry about a bust :)

---------->i agree with you there....there is no way the party could get busted 
if they are selling the tickets thru ticketmaster!!!  way too organized!!!


 Two, after going to
>many of his other parties including last years 420, I think Steve knows
>what he's doing
------------->yes,steve must know what he is doing....last year's 420  was 
GREAT!!!!!  and no busts!!!  i mean, there were actually cops walking around 
last year's party!!!!  they were prolly hired to walk around and keep an eye on 
everything!!!  last year's party went off w/o any problems!!!


...in other words, I wouldn't worry about a bust :)
--------->i second that!!!  no worries here!!!!!

-------->  what do they look like jaime???  i guess we need to decide upon one 
logo and go with it from there!!!!  i know none of us are going to have them for 
420, but that's o.k.....since it's such short notice and all!!!  i don't know of 
any places around here...maybe an office supply place like office max or 
sumtin!!!  what do you think???  hey, trouty, maybe we should put you in charge 
of the badges???? hehehehe......;-)

who the tickets are sold thru have very little to do with "getting busted"
i really doubt 420 will "get busted" since they've supposedly gotten all
the (more than insane) permits and had the building inspected.

anyhoo, that party in erie thrown by (lsd?) was supposed to be 100% bust
free got shut down at 3:30-ish.  go figure. dont promise what you cant
deliver (8 godlights, 150 dataflashes)  ....   but then again as has been
repeated here time and time again....     trust your promoter ???
something like that, i'm sure that anyone who has half followed this crap
and half cares has half an idea of what i'm talking about.
yadayadayada..............trouty.

Cool! Saturday night, 1 a.m. by the smart bar booth works for me. Do you
know for sure there is a smart bar, or just guessing?

I also heard from Crystal and Satya in reply to my post on the subject.
Can you two make that?

Satya also suggested Friday nite in the lobby at the Agora by the bar
serving food and drinks. Why don't those of us who are going Friday meet
then, too? How about 1 a.m. then, too?

I have short, blond hair and no idea what I'll be wearing, but look for
my green Ninja Turtles backpack. Don't be shy if you see me before or
after, too. Come up and say "Hi!"

Anyone else out there wanna meet up in Cleveland?

It's gonna be the shit! I'll swap you some stickers for a sucker . . .

Well, the design I saw was really cool, but the only problem I have with
it is that I don't know how recognizable it would be from a distance..
Maybe we could put a big huge bold ass "PB-CLE" on the back or somethin?
jus a thot.. :)

okay...weve talked about this enough to make a page for it so i did.
the addy is http://cac.psu.edu/~pss116/logo.html..you can link to it from
my main page.

i dont have a good idea about how these badges are gonnna be made..what
shape..how were gonna wear them so im leaving that stuff up to you guys.
ive colorized some of the images and stuff for yall to see. feel free to
take the design and change it like jeffery brick did..i included his
designs too.

as far as seeing them at a distace, how visible do you wanna be?? i mean
anyone thats looking for it will find it i think... and this isnt really an
advertisment, i thought i was something to sport as a "hey hiya doing im a
netraver too" kind of coincidence thing to put on your jacket, bookbag, or
jeans, not a "hey look at me im a netgeek" tag :p

send me any modified images if you want to add to the page....ill see
everyone at the projecthaus party thing although i dont know if ill be
wearing one of these badges..but i will if trouty or someone else makes a
bunch of em. (i dont care which design you pick either)

Hey ya'll !!

I'm going to the US on the 30th of May to do a DJ set at the Conception
party in Binghampton NY.. I'll probably spin at the Save the Robots club
in NY City as well..

Now, I'll be staying in the US for 2-3 weeks, so if anyone of you out
there would be interested in booking me for a gig or if you know anyone
that might be, please drop me a line for more info..

I've been busy in the music industry since 1990 with releases out on
European labels like Labworks, POF, Step 2 House, ClubCraft, trope,
a.f.u to mention a few..The styles I spin vary from Hardhouse to funky
acid and minimal techno depending on the party..

You can check out more at www.blurreddot.com/shaft/

Peace..

Look dude, why are you so negitave?? We have been busting our asses for
days making sure everything is done to code and compliance with all city
officials involved.  We have the city's security involved, off duty police
involved and alot of help and assistance from even more  city people. You
can't even comprehend the amount of work that is going into this show.
We go and try to do a big show, make it special, put months of work into
it, and you have to try to discourage people from commin to the show.
well here's the solution bro, stay the fuck home! Let everyone else enjoy
them selfs at the show. (they can tell you how fun it was later, and you
can kick your self for months for not comming!) I have a feeling your one
of those cats who brings a lot of people down when your at a party anyways,
always moaning about something..." oh look, that light should have been
there, the speakers are 2 inches too far to the left..."
Also, you may want to check your references, I personally have thrown over
20 parties and guess what, not one of em got busted!!! Including last years
420, which was also rumored to be getting busted. but guess what, it was
all rumors made up by people with nothing better to do than make up bust
stories. 420 last year kept going late into sunday night!!

So if you have some factual information, then please drop it , but you
better be able to back the statement up with some hard proof, ..... man I
guess you just don't know what it takes to do a show of this size, bust
your ass for 14 hours, finally get home , log on for 5 min before going to
bed, and some dork is slaggin the show you just spent 14 hours killin
yourself for...not to mention the 30 volinteers that have killed themselves
as well.
we'll i must go back to the warehouse and do some more work to ensure this
show goes off with a bang, I hope people think alittle more before posting
stupid shit, or at least think of the repercussions each statement may
have, especially if there not true, or mean in spirit!!

P&R,
sleepy c

If you're near Cleveland, by all means, go to 420. It'll be way phat.

But, I suppose that someone in Indy may be looking for something a

Well I've seen lots of kids wearing various tags for various reasons, I
just think that we should be able to tell ours from theirs, since the
point is for us to be able to recognize other pb-cle people.  I didn't
mean that we need to advertise that we're from this area, I just thought
it would be nice if they were easily recognizable :)

Sorry for not being able to post this earlier, but I was out of town on
a business trip.

First of all I want to set the record straight. We (Liquid Sound
Distortion), had all the permits and the township police assurances that
the event will proceed without any problems. The reason the police (city
of Erie and State police, and not local Township police) stooped the
party was because of noise. Even though the closest inhabited structure
was 3/4 mile away behind the venue, and across the woods, they said that
in their opinion the sound level was too high.

There is no legal reason/clause that allows the police department to
close an event and force people to leave the building without any
warranted suspicions of illegal or unsafe activity being conducted
inside (that was not reason why the cops were there). This applies to
all events requiring more that $1000 in production costs (i.e. it does
not include house parties/gatherings that can be ordered to shut down
due to noise).  If the noise is excessive, noise meters (measuring the
dB levels) have to be employed in order to determine the noise level,
rather that subjectively judge what is and what isn't loud.

Considering all of these problems with the police action as well as
several additional ones, we are in the process of taking legal action
against the P.D. We are not doing this just for ourselves,  but for the
other promoters as well who do get everything in order, and still have
problems with the law enforcement officers.

We will keep you posted as new development occur in the near future.

Concerning the party, as promised, every DJ was there, and played his 2
hour set. It only took 30 minutes to switch locations, and on everyone's
account the second space was PHAT. All the DJ's did like the event and
expressed willingness to perform in this area again in the near future.
In Felix da Housecat's and Robert Armani's words, "...the back of that
record store was the best looking underground spot since the old English
parties in '87...".

Robert De La Gauthier received most praise for his performance. If you
missed him, please check with the people who were there and hear their
comments. Everybody else was great as well, as can be expected from
their reputation and statue.

We would like to thank everyone who came to support this event. The
positive response has been overwhelming, despite the problem with the
noise/sound - and therefore police. Thank you for the encouragement, and
we will be back in the near future in full force.  


Regards,

Liquid Sound Distortion

DAMN!  I wish I was able to get out of here for *one* of these events this
week-end (singing the "end of the semester blues").  I'd love to hear
Tek-9 mixin' it up.  Reinforced as a hella good label and he has the most

i dunno when i got unsubbed from pb-cle-raves (ahem, trouty),
but i'm back on...

damn i guess i missed all the shit talk about 420 gonna be
busted or else i would've thown in my two cents earlier
...sleepy c has yet to throw a bunk party...so there's no
doubt in my mind that 420 v2.0 will go off equally as
successfully as last year's

4/20 will be doubly special for me since it will be me &
christa's one year anni (yup we bumped into each other @
last year's 420) so i know we'll be there...my only regret
is not being able to help promo for the party as hard as i
was able to last year due to school & work...so i guess i'll
hafta make up for it by being the offical 420 photographer
...yup stevie t bustin out his camera again (just like the
ole PLRM daze)!...look for me...or ask any tom, dick, or
harry cleveland ravah if u don't know who i am by now!
...but what's this i hear about badges?!...some one fill
me in...

shout outs to veronica (216 old skoolah), jeff/stuff (my
partner in crime for helping promo 420 in toronto last year),
and kitten (mebbe u can get the dance outta me again)!

see y'all @ 420...

AWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEAAAHHHHH!!!!!!

420 is just around the corner.  I have been waiting for this shit
since...last year!!

Alright, I'm gonna do my best to find y'all at 1 a.m., but I'm thinking
about how hard it was to figure out who the mw-raves crew was at New
Year's in Milwaukee...

But anyway, if you haven't met me, you probably won't recognize me by a
description (I'm quite plain-jane looking) but keep your eyes open for a
girlie about 5'5', dark blond hair (probably in a ponytail), and
especially look for a black visor with the adidas symbol printed upside
down on it...

I'll be watchin for y'all...

Oh yeah, we should re-meet at 4:20, too!!!!!!!

Later,
  Amy

your opinions are well respected . heres mine (and dont think im preaching,
this is just why im against ONE universal badge..): i like to be invisible
to the people i would normally be invisible to. the fact that i discuss
things on pb-cle-raves doesnt make me "one" of those that do, so to speak.
also, the point of us making different colors and sizes of one's choice
make it more of a DIY thing, which is why i like this stuff so much. i
usually dont wear tags at raves unless im working with the crew in charge,
and i cant see myself wearing a tag that associates me with evryone else on
here simply because i only know a few of you. for all i know you could be a
bunch of shady ass peeps who like to rob liquor stores and beat up kids in
the park for dope. hehe. i feel the less official this is the more personal
it can be, and thats what netmeets are about for me.. meeting people....if
i remeber what fucking time it is:)

i mean how many times have we been embarrassed when someones wearing the
same goddam shirt as you? does that mean we should start reproducing more
badges like that because its appareent that more than one person likes it?
if we were a clothing company, yah sure, but were just some individuals
that feel attached to this list and were not getting into any parties for
free with this or anything either (at least im not:). thats why im trying
to encourage everyone to be original with mutating styles...which is how an
egalitarian society such as ours survives (along with limiting population
growth, but i wont get into that)

peace:)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What!?!?!?! Why have a badge at all then. If you don't want one don't take
one, I agree with Chris though, it should be something easily recognizable
like the NE-Raves badges, the MW-Raves Badges, the DC raves badges, etc..
Why does every small project become an all inclusive debate anyway, it's
just a friggin piece of paper with plastic around it. Settle on a design
and make it who ever is doing so.) Democracy does not work on these
projects, they never get done. (IE: the Midland Mayhem compilation tape,
the breaks compilation tape, etc.) Make the things. Make them somewhat
cool looking, easy to tell what they are from a distance and readable.
Period. Anyone who doesn't want one, doesn't like the design, doesn't want
to feel like they are apart of something", "wants to be invisible to
people", etc DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE ONE.


> things on pb-cle-raves doesnt make me "one" of those that do, so to speak.

Oh now that makes sense now doesn't it? Make them all different colors and
sizes so no one can recognize whether it's a pb-cle-raves badge or not.
Brilliant idea there. Why don't we put different symobols on all of them
too and make sure we write pb-cle-raves really tiny like lets say an 6
point font  ON THE BACK. Yeah, that's the ticket. Make them really
non-uniform so no one know who's got one and who doesn't.

Gee and I thought it was so that list members could recognize eachother at
a party even if they had never met.

> make it more of a DIY thing, which is why i like this stuff so much. i
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Kinda like your parties that have mysteriously never got off the ground?

DIY means do it yourself not any old scribble scrabble laminated on a
chain. Again ask yourself why MOST people not pete sysco want a
pb-cle-raves badge, to recognize EACH OTHER at a party. If everyone has a
different badge don't you think that may be CONFUSING???? just a
thought...


> usually dont wear tags at raves unless im working with the crew in charge,

Then DON'T wear one. Sheesh, I thought the reason people wore list-badges
was so they could meet other people on the list that they DON'T know.

Or shady promoters for all that matter. Hey, I'm not that paranoid.

Are you sure you are not schizophrenic, I thought you said above you
didn't want to meet people you didn't know. Make up your mind pete.

Not since high school.

Whatever Pete, the fact is if you want to make your own pete sysco padge
then go right ahead, I think most people want a semi-cool, easy to read
from a distance badge that identifies them as part of the list so they can
meet other cool people from the list. If everyone has a "different
mutating style" it kind of defeats the purpose of having the badge in the
first place.   

Now I appeal to all those involved in this project, please, please, do not
let this project be "syscoized", if it does it will never happen. After
all look at his track record...

Just as a data point, this thing IS moving ahead slowly.  I've got all the submissions, I'm going to be bringing them with me to the Projekthaus/Children of the Process tomorrow, and I'm going to hand them over to either Farmer Tea or Pete Sysko--or if they're not there, or don't want 'em, I'm going to dump the whole shebang down to "crappy" cassette tapes and hand them out for free.  If anyone has last minute submissions, bring 'em to the Projekthaus, and look for the guy with the "skoop" logo taped to the back of his synth...that'll be me.  I'm slated to go on around 12-12:30.

By the way, has ANYONE started work on a Jcard for this thing?  There were something like 5 people that wanted to do it...I'll be disappointed if no one's started one yet.

Additionally (gratuitous self-promo), I'll have a LIMITED number of copies of my newest tape 'oneyeardown' for anyone that wants one Saturday night.  My live set will consist of much of the material from the tape, so if you dig what you hear, grab a tape.  One tape is reserved for mskw1, since he's such a swell guy, what with throwing the whole event and everything.  He gets a big shout out for shaking things up.

I agree completely with Joe.  The whole purpose of the badge is for  
us ppl on the list to recognize each other.  We need a pretty uniform   
badge, I mean, you can customize it a little, but just so  it's still  
recognizable. Think about it: there's  alot  of  ppl at whatever  
party you could happen to recall, and  also, its pretty dark.  You   
can't go around looking  to see the details of what everyone's  
wearing.  Also, I'm wondering why Pete's gone through the effort of   
doing  this  whole badge thing, only to decide he  doesn't  want to  
be a part  of it.

Are you sure you are not schizophrenic, I thought you said above you
didn't want to meet people you didn't know. Make up your mind pete.
Exactly.  I just don't understand the  complete 180.   I'm not  
claiming to be best friends w/ anyone from the list, but  if I  ran  
into  some of you guys, i'd sure as hell spare  a few minutes to say  
what's up, and I'd  like it if someone  came up to and did the same.   
I guess Pete's too cool for us, though, because after all, we're   
just  a bunch of ppl  from the movie Kids, stealin forties and robbin  
liqour stores.
Well that's my input.  I could go on for  awhile, but probably  
shouldn't  cause I only got 2hrs of sleep last  nite and I'm  in  
bitch mode.  On a  lighter note, hope to see ya  guys somewhere this  
weekend.

hey everyone..if you are going to be in Cleveland on saturday before the
party and are interested:

there is going to be a TAKE BACK THE NIGHT rally/march saturday at 6pm in
downtown cleveland. (if you didn't know, take back the night is a slogan
representing opposition to and intolerance for sexual violence/assault.) 

anyone interested in going and possibly meeting up to march let me know
because i think i am going to go to it. 

oh yeah and i'll prolly be at the netmeet at the actual party if i can
pull myself away from the dance floor long enough to think about it ;)


see you there!

Yeah, I'm expecting to get the tapes from skoop on Saturday and start 
playing with them on the ADAT next week.  I don't think it's going to 
take much time to get a good copy of the comp together.  Hopefully, by 
the time I'm done with the ADAT, the DAT machines in the studio will be 
fixed and we'll be all set.  

So, MSKW, are you still planning to do the J-Card?  You have the coolest, 
most architectured flyers I've ever seen, and I bet the J-Cards you'd 
design would be equally worthy of praise ... so here' on vote for you to 
get to it!!! (Besides, your parties rule :-)

you know, you can have it both ways- customized, yet recognizable. that
is the beauty of things that are _double_sided_ ::)
put the same logo on one side of the badge, (maybe print it on a neon
orange background or something to make it stand out) and then put your
favorite graphic element on the other side. I realize that this involves
both color + double-sided-ness, so it might be a bit more expensive  
if people want to go incognito for a while (or just be stylin'/unique), 
they can just turn over the badge to the picture side...
really, it _is_ possible to please (almost) everyone in this..

hey everyone..if you are going to be in Cleveland on saturday before the
party and are interested:

there is going to be a TAKE BACK THE NIGHT rally/march saturday at 6pm in
downtown cleveland. (if you didn't know, take back the night is a slogan
representing opposition to and intolerance for sexual violence/assault.)

anyone interested in going and possibly meeting up to march let me know
because i think i am going to go to it.

oh yeah and i'll prolly be at the netmeet at the actual party if i can
pull myself away from the dance floor long enough to think about it ;)


see you there!

WooHoo! Yay! That's *exactly* my point! :)  I don't care about advertising
that I'm a netgeek or anything like that.  I want uniform badges, all the
same, so that people can look for that specific design and know that the
people they find wearing it are members of the Pb-Cle-Raves mailing list,
and to acomplish that I think they should say in nice big bold letters
"PB-CLE" somewhere, possibly on the back, and then we could have a spiffy
design on the front.  I really liked pete's designs, but you couldn't tell
what the fuck it said if you were two feet away from it..

Does this seem like common sense to anybody else? :)

Awww shit, here we go :)


Anyways, it would be nice if we could get the badge thing off the ground
and going, then we could all start meeting eachother ;)

um, I did design a rather bright, distinctive logo a while back... it's
on my webpage www.andrew.cmu.edu/~ecoslor/work.html
I'm not sure how easy to read it is from a distance, but the orange is
sure hard to miss...
see whacha think...

I wouldn't worry about it too much, I think that any activity partaken
upon by this list is bound to go through the same thing :)

I've made up 8 'temporary' badges, with petes origional black and white
design on flourescent paper and i wrote PB-CLE-RAVES in big sloppy
handwriting on the back :) I covered them with contact paper so they're
almost laminated :)

> p.s........i personally would like a badge!!!!!!

I'll save one of the cheesy ones I've got for you, if you're going to the
agora tonight just look around the bar around 1:30 for a kid with a burger
king hat, and a bright flourescent tag on his bag, tiz me ;)

Chris

Hi,

        After reading Joe LaSesne's letter about the badges, sorry if I
spelled it wrong, I am left feeling as though we've gotten into a big stupid
argument about these badges.  I do agree with him that they probably should
be uniform so that we can recognize one another if we meet so9mewhere, but
what the hell was the reason for the lack of respect.  Pete was merely
expressing how he felt.  It was not a rude letter, merely sarcastic.  What
I'm trying to say here is can we get a little more love.  If you want to
argue go to the republican mailing list and glorify communism, or fascism.
Well, just a thought.  Please don't flame me because that would just be the
wackest thing in the world.  

much LOVE,

-Paco

hi i hope someone can help me :)

i need a ride to 420 for just saturday, the only problem is that i can't
leave until around 12:30-1:00AM which is too late for everyone i know that
is going. i live in Oberlin, Ohio which is about 45 minutes southwest of
cleveland, so if anyone knows they are coming through here to go to 420 on
saturday kinda late, please let me know i would really like to go (a ride
back is not necessary).

thanks,
paul

hehe. in retrospect, it probably wasnt wise to try to get a final word on
the easily arguable stoopid argument about badges. i did feel insulted and
mocked in an arogant way....sometimes i get touchy like that and it makes
me feel better to flame people...thanks for sticking up for me paco. :)

love,
the sysconizer

Hey I am not disrespecting you in any way but I DO think you sould learn
how to spell civilization (if you are american) or civilisation (if you
are british) before you lecture us on it. As for the badges pete, the
world as a whole is artificial, techno music is artificial, your friggin
computer is artificial, hell, email is artificial. SO knowing all this why
don't you sell all your belongings, become a hippie, and join a nudist
colony in California? Just pecause something is artficial doesn't mean its
bad.

that speaks for itself... When was the last time a legit promoter emails
EVERYONE he wants to spin, makes them drawup contracts and change their
plans of other activities or other books and then cancels the party
without emailing all of those same people??????

I personally think you have taken too many drugs and have gone " 'round
the bend" but that's just my opinion. All I am saying is be a bit mor
professional if you are going to have great plans. If you aren't serious
about something then say so from the get go. If something (like a space)
looks iffy then say so from the get go.

Well I think you are schizophrenic, I mean you talk about 303's and
ancient  pre-civilized man in the same paragraph. Look man, make up your
mind, either you want to be a cave man, or a jetson. One or the other.

Keep your excitement up but please don't tell us you are throwing another
party unless you 1) Have the money, 2) Have the space and 3) Have some
idea what you want to do and not just let things be anarchic just because
you live your life that way. Anarchy is no way to throw a party.

Now, now Pete, there is no need to call ANYONE on this list a bitch. Why
are you gonna disrespect her like that. That is TRUELY ILL. Settle down
and think logically for a second. Perhaps it's not everyone against pete

I am a musician who has just taken the opportunity to join your list.  I
would like to tell everyone in the group about myself.  I have been writing
music for a few years, and have decided to compile some of my best songs on a
CD.  My music is a mixture of new age, classical, and ambience.  Anyone who
is interested in hearing
it can go to:  http://members.aol.com/mmd390/music.htm

You can chat with others, listen to wave files, and add a free link to your
own page
here.  Also, by signing my guestbook you will be entered into a drawing in
June for
a free, separate complimentary CD of my other recordings!

I hope to hear from all of you soon.

Thank you,
Merri Davidson

tonite is 420 v 2.0, the party i've been looking forward to for an
indescribably long amount of time.  seemingly, there has been a "last
minute space change" to the infamous agora.  FUCK THAT.  you don't change
to the agora at the last minute.  on a saturday nite it just happened to be
open?  riiight.  i checked ticketmaster's website and the saturday only
tickets say "cleveland agora" right on them, and it's also on the agora's
schedule!  looks like this was planned to me.  and still 30 bucks!!
whatever...

i've lost every bit of excitement i had for this party.  and to think how
many people i told not to go to ritual cuz 420 would be slammin'.  now i
wish *i* had gone to ritual.  the only reason i'm still going tonite is
because two people who are severe fans of rob hood's work are counting on
me for a ride and i don't wanna leave them stranded.

and i'll eat my hat if the party actually goes til 10am.  what a load of crap.

guess i'll try to make the most of it, even tho shelling out my money for
this crock of shit goes against every moral fiber of my being.

maybe spawntaneous' next party should be called "bend over please it'll
make this easier"?  after this i'm never going back to cleveland, EVER.

take two of these and thank me in the morning,

As everyone has already said - emergency movement to the Agora? My ass!
I probably wouldn't have gone if I didn't already have a ticket. I
progressed from being annoyed at every Cleveland event is held there to
the point where I now hold some deep-seated hatred of the place. I was not
expecting much fun.
We got there what we thought was early - about 11. But we still had to
wait almost 2 hours in line, most of it in the cold. My expectations
continue to plummet. 
Finally I get in and wander to the two downstairs rooms. Not sure who was
in the main room, but it sounded like typical NY/NJ hard stuff. Not what I
really like, even though I am from that area. The small room was OK, no
tracks or mixing that really did anything for me. The upstairs room was
not quite as full, and there was some decent hip-hop going on, so I stayed
up there for a while.
For the next few hours I wandered around hearing nothing that made me want
to go into that room. Adam Beyer was pretty good, pretty tight mixing, but
way too Millsy. Heard tracks of the new PMs about 6 times over the night,
esp. the bells. After Beyer some other foreign guy, who again played
minimal, banging, Millsy techno, which by now was starting to really bore
me.
So no fun so far - then about 4 or so the fun begins. Monochrome is
playing live upstairs. Didn't seem like all that many people got into it,
except for the jungle track, but I though it was brilliant. Good job! Then
Phantom 45 comes on, oh good I thought. Something that'll maybe get me
dancing, maybe even some gangsta samples :) But then something told me to
go downstairs, and luckily for me I arrived just as Aux 88 was setting up. 

GOD DAMN!!! These guys were worth the however much the party was alone.
The entire time I was pressed up against the stage jumping up and down and
screaming my head off! These guys not only make some of my favorite music,
and do it well live, they also put on a half-decent show - lots of little
choreogaphed things, lots of talking over the music through various
effects such as the vocoder. Brilliant. That's all I can say.

Forget what was after Aux 88 - probably more boring techno (IMO, of
course). The next thing of interest I remember is Rob Hood live, which was
pretty good, but not all that different from his records to be really
interesting. It was cool - but not enough to make me stay. I think I was
in the back room where Dego started out spinning some great house and went
into some insane jungle. Loved it.

Next-upstairs - Odi torn shit apart again and again. The guy knows his
records like the back of his hand. He would sit around looking bored, then
all of a suddent grab the turntable and mix it in right when some new
sound or something was coming in. He played some great tracks, and his
scratching was UNREAL. Again had me jumping up and down and screaming and
waving lighters and such.

Then after Dego downstairs came Stickmen. One did a 50 minute set or so,
then the other did an hour. I'm not sure which is which. The first guy
played some discoey techno-house, for lack of a better description. Lots
of cool sounds and unusual synth patterns, a more driving techno-ish beat,
with funky house rhythms on top and groovy basslines. Even though this was
7 in the morning he got me off my ass and dancing for the first time of
the night. The second stickguy played more breaks-type stuff. Pretty good,
but not enough to keep me dancing (it takes a lot to get me moving). Ran
back upstairs to see the last 20 minutes of Odi's set, which was still out
of control crazy! 
By this time its 9 and Onionz is playing some typicalish Onionz morning
stuff. Upbeat, slightly housey, slight trancey, but not to the point it
would drive me away. Got me dancing a little bit, but I think that was
mostly late morning energy rush. Then we left, hope to make it back Sunday
night, but I don't know how that'll work out.

Summary:
Music -  Great music after 5, didn't like much before then.
Space - Hate it. Too crowded. Too many place for people to sit, too few
	for them to dance. Everyone hates the Agora, there's no need to go on
	with this.
Atmosphere - Smoky, smoky, smoky. I hate smoke. People were pretty cool,
	very few people were especially friendly, but not much attitude at all.
Overall - If it had been at a decent warehouse this would have been
	undescribably super mad phat. The agora kind of limited it to just
	really, really good. Still one of the best parties I've been to in a
	while. Hope to see some of you Sunday night (if I can stay
	awake until then...)

Eric

Greetings Netizens,

  Ritual was probably the phatest Ultraworld party ever.  I was sitting
in the bleachers, starring down to a packed DC Armory, listening to Josh
Wink, with the most amazing light effects.  BTW, Happy B-Day Josh ;-) 
Rabbit in the Moon never cease to amaze me and LTJ BUKEM along with MC
CONRAD set up the stage for the master Sir Scott Henry to close the
night.  Mad Props to Lonnie and Jason.  Who came to Nectar at The Edge
last night after Ritual?  DIESELBOY played at our parties for the first
time and all I have to say is that we want him back.  He played to a
packed house from 4:30 till 6:30am.  At 8:15, when Sam Burns stopped the
music and Jesse turn on the lights, there was still well over fifteen
hundred of y'all.  Hope everyone had a great time :-)  I was too busy
%-) all night.

Peace.

i want to personally apologize to all those who came out to 420 v2.0,
to think i felt bad for not being able to help promo it this year!
i don't know why the hell i'm apologizing for because it was obviously
not my party, but i still feel guilty and incredibly stupid for wasting
the 2 hours it took to type up the e-flyer that was posted to all the
rave lists. two hours that i should've spent getting work done...
which is exactly what i am doing now, instead of wasting my time,
money, and energy once again.

i kinda figured the shit wuz wack when i found out it would be at the
agora. and if that wasn't bad enough...b'jesus the security!!...full
body search, kids were having stuff confiscated left and right...no
markers, no drugs, no chains, NO CAMERAS!!!...i can understand the
first two but b'jesus, no chains and _NO CAMERAS_?!...what the fuck?!
gawd knows how many kids wear those ball chain necklaces! the two kids
in front of me had to hide them in their underwear! even Christa had
to hide my camera in her panties for me! to think i was going to take
pictures at the party and give'em to sleepy c for not being able to help
promo the party this year! i didn't snap a singleshot in fear i would
have my camera confiscated!

the worst part wuz i knew kids who were coming in from detroit, chicago,
columbus, dayton, pittsburgh, etc...atleast i live here in cleveland, so
i didn't have to feel quite as ripped off for paying the extra money &
time to get here...my only consolation was showing amy & her detroit crew
around town before the party...atleast i was able to show some out of
towners not all clevelanders are out to rip you off, there are some
decent kids that live in this city...we're not all greedy promotors
or dj's that can give a shit less about ravers as long as they can take
their money...i feel the worst for them because they got a hotel room
...if they had got a hold of me earlier i would have provided them with
a crash space for free also

christa and i felt so disspointed and guilty that we left at around 3:30am

in fact i feel so guilty and dissapointed that i'm not even going to bother
reviewing the party itself

props to all the true people that made the party...all the kids that traveled
from afar and still danced the night away despite of all the dissapointments,
all the dj's and live acts...we know it's your job and you get paid for it...
but YOU are the ones that truly make it happen...especially: rob hood, mike
dearborn, atomic babies, aux 88, and adam beyer...and props to the up & coming
dj's that aren't in it for the money or the fame: titonton, monochrome, lunar,
kevin krellyn, and chris pulse

oh yah there wuz one other good thing, i was finally able to personally
apologize to wilhelm for not being able to carry out the cleveland/columbus
bus trip to Get Busy...unfortunately i didn't stick around late enough to
pick up the flyers for Get Freaky 2 he was supposed to give to me cuz we left
so early.

shout outs to all the ole friends we saw at the party...you know who you are
...stay true and don't let the negativity get to yah...

Ok, I went to 'children and I would have to say that I disagree with a
lot of what people are saying about it, most prominently this:

> It was quite a good vibe, and only one complaint from the neighbours...
there was definately not a good vibe before we left at 2:30... there
weren't enough people and more importantly, there weren't enough
_positive_ people. all you positive groovers know who you are, but it
seems like there were a whole lot of people standing around and being
all pretentious and negative. or maybe it was the beer (alcohol tends to
give a weird vibe to parties)
oh, my other complaint was that live act with the cheezy synth riffs. it
was oh so erasure.

despite these problems, I do think that this is an important idea. we
need to have people getting together and hanging out in a more intimate
setting. houses are good because you can always go outside and actually
talk to people. I think that this thing is just in the beginning phases,
(assuming of course, that this is going to happen again) so I'm hoping
to see a whole lot more kids next time.
also, the space was pretty phat. good lights downstairs. maybe some
beanbags/cushions would be nice so people could chill? all that smoke
gave it a crazy cool feel. also, the upstairs seemed to be too brightly
lit. oh, and that room on the second floor with the fireplace was
totally cool. if there was an ambient/afterhours/triphop dj in there it
would have totally completed the place (3 floors of different techno...
::)

projecthaus => building the scene.
good work.

Hi,
I have been asked to MC for Anabolic Frolic at Bassrush this weekend and I
was wondering if anyone had space for me in thier car. 
Here's what I can offer:

* Lots of cool jungle mixtapes to listen to on the way down.
* Interesting conversation.
* Free admitance for the entire car.


If any of this appeals to you then write me back at the addy above.

I liked the vibe.. it's a different kinda vibe. it's not the

don't rip on skoop. he's good, and if you don't like it ya coulda 
listened to the top floor.... personally if i don't like it, i'll go 
somewhere else... honestly people dont's seem to remember anything but 
bass. there was something called synthpop. hatin won't make it leave ya.

i'd rather see more adults and less club kids. a group of addidasses 
showed up and just had this frown, and dragged a bad vibe in with them.

Well, I had a good time, as usual, at Michael's projekt haus this past
Saturday.  True to the progression of things so far, this party was bigger
and more organized than the prvious ones, with even more new faces that I
haven't seen before, and more of the house was fixed up.  I really
think the main reason Michael throws these parties is for incentive to
work on a new room of his house each month :-) To which I have to say, the
bottom floor was very nice, and I can't wait to see that in it's next
stage of evolution.  Big respect to the Youngstown crew that showed up and
brought the lights and the computer visuals to play with.  You guys
definitely brought the party to a new level.  The fog machine was cracking
me up ... it made the bottom two floors look *very* cool.  I enjoyed all
of the live sets that I was present for (unfortunately I didn't get to
catch Trouty's set, but now I've got his tape to listen to for the comp,
so that's good).  Skoop has an impressive setup, and 1.8.7 was pounding
out the new tunes once the PA was worked out. I was glad to get a chance to
play my tunes straight out of my sampler; the PA sounded nice and I was
thankful for the positive response of my friends who stuck around to hear
my set. 

All in all, I think this party was a blast.  Yeah, there was beer there, 
so things got hazy by 4am, but this was a house party, not a Rave, and I 
*like* to be able to drink a good beer while chillin' to the sounds my 
friends are creating.  I hope there's another one like this soon.

laters,
Toby

i would like to know if anyone remembers family affair??

	everyone seems to be so discouraged with our scene right now.

	it seems everyone has forgotten that some big parties do come off with
one FUCK of a vibe. maybe everyone forgot about UPS because we keep the
underground vibe??? i dunno.

	so everyone keep an eye out for FAMILY AFFAIR III flyers. 
	this is a real party.
	
	should i say here that the first 4.20 didn't really impress me too
much? don't get me wrong, I had fun, it was a thoroughly OKEY DOKEY BIG
PARTY. had more fun wit my rolls than wit the party :(   it's like i
always say: it's all about the VIBE VIBE VIBE VIBE VIBE VIBE VIBE. some
promoters or crews or pps may jus get caught up in the "side
attractions" of our lovely scene sometimes. but i'm sure they've still
got it deep down!!

	Chris, Greta, Oscill-8, and others, sorry i didn't see any of you this
weekend at 4.20. i spent a wonderful weekend wit a wonderful woman and
my wonderful friends in Akron. sorry to hear the party disappointed many
of you. 

	BUT..... don't forget that family affair will also be 30 bones or less,
only will go for two SOLID NIGHTS and three mornings. no having to leave
and come back the next day, no confiscated chains (wut da fukk??? aren't
we supposed ta be about freedom???), or cameras (maybe a check in car
trunks for stowaways tho :( ) and a vibe OF PEACE AND UNDERGROUND LOVE
THAT IS UNPARALLELLED. i've never been to a better party with a better
vibe or better music. let me put it like dis: NO ROLLS NECESSARY HERE!!! 

	i guess i should say "don't give up on the spawntaneous promoters!!"
but since i didn't go to the party due to lack of desire (didn't feel
that electric "OooOOoOOooOOhhHHh SHIT!!! vibe in the air or from the pps
i talked to. not even the day after the preparty) i guess i'm not really
the one to be sayin that.

	but i gotta say sumpin positive. gotta respect Spawntaneous for makin
the $$$ to keep the cleve vibe goin. maybe this 4.20 experience will
make them concentrate on that lil darned.. ummm... V-I-B-E a lil more.
this could turn out to be a positive learning experience.

	like i said, remember UPS parties. esp when Fam Affair III comes 
around. our parties are a bit more vibe. support your own local scene
and small club/bar/after+pre events and all those lil grimy happenins in
the "ghetto" that aren't in immaculate air-conditioned/carpeted/concert
arena spots. keep your ears open and BEWARE OF LARGE FLYERS: babylon
tinsel an glitter..  
	Cuz when it comes down to it in the end, what matters is what WE THE
PPS SUPPORTING THIS SCENE/VIBE/MOVEMENT say about parties. and all the
money and production in the world thrown into a party is justified or
dissed by the pps simply saying "it was PHATT" or "it was WAK". that's
it. that's the difference between a good an bad party. not all the loot
and lights an this an that an who knows who or paid who what or
criticism or praise or hyping up or down. please don't get caught up in
the "side attractions" cuz they don't make a party. it all hinges on
those two words uttered by OUR PEOPLE "phatt" or "wak".

	the vibe is as simple as that.

	PEACE LOVE UNITY RESPECT,

		keane

i forgot to say UPS will be back at the Daily Double soon (startin this
week or next week) to keep the underground vibe goin in the area. even
tho the spot owner is an ass, but hey, sometimes ya gotta do what ya
gotta.

	so on tuesdays we'll have acid jazz/trip hop/experimental music.  	
this will be sumpin ta see all the DJs given full 	 artistic/creative
liscense without worryin about what will make 	 a crowd dance. prolly be
$2 for 21+. not sure about under yet.

	On Fridays (i think) we'll have our house/techno/rave/whatever ya 	feel
like callin it night.
		this'll have the UPS DJs and guest DJs straight up MOVIN 		MAD ASSES.
not sure of price. prolly $3 21+, $5 18-21 		unless a BIG event or DJ
comes.

Subject: {pb-cle} What actually happened with 420 info by Sleepy C
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I would like to appoligize to all the people who are bitching about 420
being at the Agora. Some of you think we had this planned all along, but
that is so far from the truth that it hurts me. Some say we moved it there
to cheapen the cost of the show, well it actually raised the cost by
$15,000.00, and because of the space change, we lost $45,000 this weekend.
(this is not  a bullshit statement, we are truly fucked!)

The most dissapointing thing about this weekend was knowing how fat the
origional space was, and knowing how much time we put into it. And then
finding out we could not use it. I going to list below the event's that
lead to us moving the party to the agora, then maby you will understand
that we really didn't want the show there, but we had no choice.

April 13th - 15th 35 - 40 kids volinteered from 8am till 8pm everyday to
help with the warehouse space, cleaning, scraping paint, building wooden
handicap ramps, moving large piles of stuff around.

April 15th 10 am - Our first inspection from all the citys officials. They
let us know that all was looking good, and that just a few more emergency
lights would get us to code, then they joked about this space being too
clean for our 420 party. (a reference to last years warehouse) We scheduled
a final meeting for April 17th at 1 pm. This is when all the officials sign
off on the permits, (that we applied for 3 months earlier ) and we get full
ok to go on with the show. All the volenteers are still bustin thier backs
just to make sure the space was fat. (We have like 4 rolls of film from the
other space, showing the kids working,the lighting equipment going up ect,
i will try to get pictures up on the net, very soon, so you can SEE how
hard we were working!!

April 17th - we got to the warehouse early and did the few things we needed
to do to make sure the building was good for the inspection, finally at
1pm, the inspectors showed up once again. Harry (from Centrak Lasers) and
myself showed the officials around, and talked and laughed with them. After
about 45 minuits of inspection, all the inspectors and officials signed off
on the permits, and we were legal!!! In fact I gave away 10 tickets to the
inspectors , because they wanted to check out the show. We continued to set
up the lights and adjust the space.

April 17th 5:05 pm - A friend of a friend working at the city's safty
office called us and said he had some news that was just crazy, and that he
wasn't able to tell us, but he would tell us anyway. He said that the head
safty inspector had retracted his signature, and that he left no reason,
and he could not be reached. We all freaked out. With out this signature,
we would have no way to have the party at the warehouse with out it getting
busted. We tried for the rest of the night to find out why the signature
was pulled. We called all the other inspecters and they said that they
didn't know why he would do that, and we were doing everything right in the
citys eyes, so we got no answers. We tried to figure things out till about
5am.

April 18th 6:00 am - Harry and I tried to have a meeting with the safty
inspector, (I even put on a suit, took out my earings and slicked my hair
back, "Corperate-C") he refused to see us, so hairry called him, and he
said that if harry called  again he would press harrassment charges. Things
were looking grim, I started to worrie that 420 would be canceled, after
all the hype and work that many many people had put into it. By 10am, Harry
and I were working the phones trying to get some answers, but this was all
haulted by a visitor.
I opened the office door to see Senator Dennis Kucinich standing there. At
that point I knew the shit was getting deep. He talked with Harry for quite
a while, and then me and then left. What he said made me feel like vomiting
all over the place. Here is what he said, and here is the reason for 420
getting moved!!!

He said, you guys did everything right, you are golden in the citys eyes,
but you chose the wrong building to do this event. It wouldn't matter if
you spent $1000000 restoring the space, the show could not go on there. The
reason being is that the Federal Goverment has involvement with that
building, and it goes way over even the goverment of Cleveland, even the
Goverment of Ohio.
So I did some snooping, and found out that there's some crazy shit going on
behind the scene's in that building, I don't really know the details, but
it is real, and it fucked up our show.

April 18th - The preparty goes off as planned at the Agora.

April 19th - 9am - We now know that no matter what we do, we will not be
able to get the permit re-signed. So we then try to decide do we do the
show there anyways, and risk it getting busted, or do we move it to a space
we know people hate, loose a few people, but let the party go on till 10
am, with no bust. After about an hour of debate, the descion was made to go
to the agora. We all felt sick, but we knew we had to make sure the party
was atleast going to happen.

April 19 - 12pm We released that we needed 3 rooms of sound, so we found
the upstairs room and build a floor for it in like 4 hours, once again kids
volentered and rocked the job.Also Thunder and Lighting noew start moving
their lighting from the warehouse to the Agora, (Setting up equipment twice
does not make happy lighting guys!!)

April 19th - 12am  The show starts, all but Cj bolland show, (His manager
has stold a $1000 deposite from us and a $750 plane ticket, and never sent
us Cj!!)
Even though all the dj's/pa's were their, piles of sound, $15,000 worth of
lighting and the lasers, it still wasn't enough, after the word got out
about the space change, people told us to fuck ourselfs. At the end of the
night we got 1725 people, we needed about 2900 with the space change, so we
are fucked!!
We estimate the loss to be near $45,000.00. Let me tell you, that's alot of
loot!

 I don't quite understand a few things about this scene of ours, it's
suspossed to be about the music, the dancing the friendship but now it
seems to be about the space. Granted the Agora pretty much sucks, in the
situation we were in, what were we to do?? We still had the party go off
(it was fun), and we could of just canceled the show, but we thought people
would understand and back us up, to show the federal goverment, or the city
that a little problem won't stop us,but I guess we were wrong.

I would like to take the time to thank every person who busted thier back
workin on the Richmond Brothers space. You guys were awsome, and we are
going to post some pictures of the work we all did, so that the rest of the
people can see that we had a bond and a unity working in that space, a
common goal of making sure that this years 420 was going to be the sickest
ever, but that was snuffed
by  elements we could not controll, but still you guys rule, thanks,
thanks, thanks.

Also, I would like to thank all the kids who came anyways, you guys are the
true spirit of the rave scene, even though all this shit happened,I did see
quite a few smiling faces, and that was cool.

I WANTED TO GET A BIT NEGITIVE HERE AND SAY A BUNCH OF CRAP ABOUT THE
PEOPLE WHO THINK WE DID THIS SHOW AT THE AGORA INTENTIONALLY, BUT THAT'S
USELESS, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME NOW YOU NEVER WILL, SO I APPOLIGZE THAT WE
WERE FORCED TO MOVE THE SPOT, I APPOLIGIZE THAT THE CITY/FEDERAL GOVT
FUCKED US.


Once again thanks to all who supported us,
Peace & respects,

Stephen "Sleepy C" Cinch

Ps. don't look for many Psychoactive parties in the future, I think I may
just retire, or at least stop for a while, my heart is torn after this
years 420.

Listen asshole, it said Agora on the friday tickets, and sunday tickets,
not the Saturday tickets. Also I lost $10000 redoing the Richmond Brothers
space, do you think I like throwing money away???? Are you that fucking
stupid??? Ask any of the 40 kids that busted thier ass working on the space
for the last week, you will see the pictures of the space as soon as thier
developed, I will post them.
You don't know shit about the politics of doing a party so shut the fuck
up. I am fucking enraged at you, I killed myself trying to make a space
work, i broke my hand up, fucking hammering wood together to build a wheel
chair ramp in the richman space, we got the permits and the fed's pulled
them, let me ask you king of all that is rave, what the fuck would you do.
Also, the agora was not avaible, we had to have the band that was playing
there move into the ball room to acomidate our show. And this only happeded
because henery from the agora was cool with us for doing the pre and after
parties there. Man it's people like you who make me hate this whole thing.
I mean come on, knowing that the Agora is hated, why would you think we
would want it there?? Also, after fixing up a space for a week, spending
$10000 on it, why would we want to pay another $28000 to use the agora.
That's right pal, the bill for the weekend space was $28,000. that's $20000
more then the other space was costing us, so if you have any intelligence
at all , you can easily see it wasn't a premeditated move.
Man I've had it, I have tried to do alot for this scene, and In some ways I
have, but when your back get's put against a wall, and all the people that
I thought were behind me leave me hangin, It hurts. So fuck it, i'm done...

please learn the true situation , before dissin people,
Sleepy C

I just want to say  to Steve that I love you man. I didn't make it up
this year from Dallas, but One thing I know, Steve has beenfucked two
years in arow and did this for all of us. I also know that his credit and
financial situation has been seriously compromid=3Dsed by throwing parties.
H e does well makin and spinnin records and his writing/ production
abilities are some of the best in the nation.  If it wasn't for him,
Cleveland would hardly be on the map.  He has constantly tried to do
things for you guys, and people never care. Aplace in a America to throw
a party to hold more than2500 people without getting busted is now almost
unheard of. But he has told me over the years how he would be doing well
financialyy if it wasn't for the parties. Everyone's attitude just chased
off the best promotor I ever met. Next year you'll wish you were doing
something around mid-april. <bold>MAD FUKKIN PROPS STEVE..YOU ARE WHAT
THE TRUE SCHOOL IS ALL ABOUT.</bold> Everyone here should be sending
Steve a props and thank you letters, he loves you guys, let him know you
had fun, and remember what its all about(remember youcame for the
lineup...)

a)- who is going?

b)- who wants to go?

c)- who can drive?

d)- who wants to rent a car and go?

if u are gonna be at steelcityjungle (scj) maybe we can do this all
prepared like, seen? ;)

this is also directed to the ohio peeps...i know theres gonna be mad heads
trekking for dis one... and speaking of heads.. youd wouldnt believe how
many threats have been directed towards raymond's if this doesnt come
together.. if u see something rolling down the streets of baltimore at 3am,
you can best believe it aint a bowling ball :)

but nonetheless it stands to reason that u come correct for this one.. ie-
be prepared/expecting the worst, that way u can only be pleasantly
surprised if it comes together :)

seriously...be ready for a space change, be ready for the party to start
later than u expected...just be ready.. dont be STUPID and you know what i
mean...dont give anyone any reason to shut us down and keep us from brockin
out to the sounds of the dj hype + co.


see u tomorrow nite...right? :)

peace,
hossam

Hi: 
On the front page of the style section of the Washinton Post was a article
about raves in general and about  the rave last weekend at the DC Armory.
It was a very UP AND UP piece and it was very good press:)  The name of the
piece
is called "moving to another state"  and was written by Alona Wartofsky.
If you get the chance, try to read it.  I think that you will be happy what
you read:)~

Can't drive, but can help pay gas/tolls, bring some mixtapes, candy  &

Would like to be part of a trip if there's room.
Anyone know about the trip that N'Sync was going to run.  I have a feeling
this fell through, but I haven't had a chance to check it out because I'v
been doing lots of schoolwork.  Just mentioning it - the 26th is my last
day of finals, so i can't leave until after 12 noon...but after that I'll
be dying for a release.

I'll be there forsure. :)  I have a good feeling about SCJ - many many
heads shall represent pittsburgh jungle kulture.
Anyone not sure about coming...I must emplore you to...187's new live
stuff completely wrecks shop!!  Farmer tea awlays comes out with the sweet
b-line cuts that I love, and dieselboy..you know the score!

Hope to see people there. :)

ok, im not going to support anyone.. but since when has a rave been about the
space?
i thought it was about electrnoic music, and the people who LOVE it gettin to
gether? hmm.. o wait gotta have a cool space to do you drugs sorry.
ok, mabye the spaced sucks. [i wouldn't acualy know, i was at the childrren
of the process to support pittsburgh]
i was at 420v1 and it rocked.. v2 looked even better.
for people who like TECHNO.. its slammin.. aux88 live, rob hood live...
35$? not bad for that regardless where the hell the space is..
big parties are hard to throw. its that simple.. at least it happened..
oh no CJ bolland did show up! the  whole party sucks! 
oh, and vibe only sucks if you let it.. get lost in ytour own world.. i've
been to partyes with no vibe, and had a blast cause the toons rocked.
example.. Cubby Wubby [anyone rember it?] the last lollipop posse party.
i don't know if anyone off this list went. i know Joe did..
there was like no one there [they lsot there shirts] but i had a blast!
like everyone was hiddin inthe corners ans stuff, but I had fun. don't reliy
on other people to have a vibe, have your own..

thats it..
it happened. its done. lets leave it alone.it your mad at sleepy, you should
be happy. hes got lots o shit to deal with now [like no $$] so why rub it in?

REASONS WHY E-MAIL IS LIKE A PENIS:

1.  SOME FOLKS HAVE IT, SOME DON'T.  THOSE WHO HAVE IT WOULD BE DEVASTATED
IF IT WERE EVER CUT OFF.  THEY THINK THAT THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE IT ARE
SOMEHOW INFERIOR.  THEY THINK IT GIVES THEM POWER.

2.  THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE IT MAY AGREE THAT ITS A NIFTY TOY BUT THINK IT'S
NOT WORTH THE FUSS THAT THOSE WHO HAVE IT MAKE ABOUT IT.  STILL, MANY OF
THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE IT WOULD LIKE TO TRY IT.

3.  IT CAN BE UP OR DOWN.  ITS MORE FUN WHEN ITS UP, BUT IT MAKES IT HARD
TO GET ANY REAL WORK DONE.

4.  IN THE LONG DISTANT PAST, ITS ONLY PURPOSE WAS TO TRANSMIT INFORMATION
CONSIDERED VITAL TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES.  SOME PEOPLE STILL THINK
THAT'S THE ONLY THING IT SHOULD BE USED FOR, BUT MOST FOLKS TODAY USE IT
FOR FUN MOST OF THE TIME.

5.  ONCE YOU'VE STARTED PLAYING WITH IT, IT'S HARD TO STOP.  SOME PEOPLE
WOULD JUST PLAY WITH IT ALL DAY IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE WORK TO DO.

6.  IT PROVIDES A WAY TO INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE.  SOME PEOPLE TAKE THIS
INTERACTION VERY SERIOUSLY, OTHERS TREAT IT AS A LARK.  SOMETIMES IT'S HARD
TO TEL WHAT KIND OF PERSON YOU'RE DEALING WITH UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.

7.  IF YOU DON'T APPLY THE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIVE MEASURES, IT CAN SPREAD
VIRUSES.

8.  IT HAS NO BRAIN OF ITS OWN.  INSTEAD, IT USES YOURS.  IF YOU USE IT TOO
MUCH, YOU'LL FIND IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO THINK COHERENTLY.


9.  WE ATTACH AN IMPORTANCE TO IT THAT IS FAR GREATER THAN ITS ACTUAL SIZE
AND INFLUENCE WARRANT.

10.  IF YOU AREN'T CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO WITH IT, IT CAN GET YOU IN TROUBLE.

11.  IT HAS ITS OWN AGENDA.  SOMEHOW, NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOUR INTENTIONS,
IT WILL WARP YOUR BEHAVIOR.  LATER YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF:  "WHY ON EARTH DID
I DO THIS?"

12.  IT HAS NO CONSCIENCE AND NO MEMORY.  LEFT TO ITS OWN DEVICES, IT WILL
JUST DO THE SAME DAMN DUMB THINGS IT DID BEFORE.

Heard the bad news about this weekend, and just wanted to throw in my 
support and understanding. A shame people didn't shell out there cash to 
help you out of a jam. I sure would have. Had every intention of coming and
even after I heard the bad news I still tried my best to make it to 
Cleveland this weekend, but couldn't quite do it.

You'll never believe what happened. Saturday about noon (I had to work in
the morning) I started getting all excited inside and about four I finished
ch.2 (that thesis thing, ya know) and started packing up. Low and behold, 
just as I am getting in my car - it must have been 5 or so at this point, 
my chevette comes to life without me even taking the key out of pocket. Oh,
and to hear her humm like that, best she ever ran. So anyway, I manage to get 
myself belted in and grab the steering wheel, but it is not doing much good.
The wheel rips out of my hands and I swear I end up on two wheels turning 
onto this alley down from my street. So the car bounces once or twice and 
finally settles but there is this glowing red dude next to me moving his 
hands in the air like he's holding a steering wheel, but there is no wheel.
Still, when he moves his hands, the car moves with them, so I really just 
don't know what was going on. So by this point he has made another right
and we are going way fast, and then another, and another, always right.

Eventually I must have lost it, cause the next thing I remember I am in 
this super sublime kind of coffee shop sipping the best espresso I've 
ever had listening to a bunch of glowing dudes in green robes speaking. I 
couldn't understand a damn thing, and they sure weren't paying any attention
to me. All the light was coming from the glowing dudes and there equally 
glowing capes, and when I looked at the espresso, it looked kind of orangish
purplish. 

So I remembe sitting at that same little tiny table sipping for what seemed 
like hours and all of a sudden I start rubbing my eyes and I wake up and 
my chevette is still running but hardly humming and the car is descretely 
off the road in some small dirty lawn so I drive back onto the street and 
figured out where I was, only about a mile from my house, and notice that the
sun is coming up. Sure enough, its Sunday morning and I've missed the party.

so I head home and start working on ch.3
Just wanted to let you know that I am sorry for not being able to show up and
support the scene and all.

sEth

(the gratuitous part about waking up early all this week so that I could 
change my oil, tune up the engine, blah blah blah ... omitted)




..........................................



So for real now, I hope someone got something of a laugh out of the satire.
It is probably in poor taste, but what can you do. My real reason for writing
is not so much to criticize the party as to provide a few questions that may 
make someone think a bit.

First off, I didn't go to the show. I had thought about it for a while, and 
was even excited for a bit, but ended up losing interest. My comments are more
directed towards attitude than anything else. 

If I had gone, I don't think I would have minded the Agora. I don't go out so
much that I have been there too many times, and mainly go to dance, and dance,
and drink water, and dance, and... So I am really not put off by that part of 
things so much.

What does bother me supremely is the flow of events that preceded and post-ceded
the show itself. 

In the weeks prior to the show, occasionally posts would come up that would 
question some aspect of the weekend, be it the price or the chance of a bust, I
think there might have been a couple of other little problems. Now as a consumer
these things seemed pretty relevent to me and I was interested, and a couple of 
people would reply that it was ok, and then a couple would say they were worried,
and so on, and all of a sudden sleepy would burst in, and play some grudge card
and exclaim that the mild criticism was just the result of sour grapes and the 
author trying to sabatoge the party. He would then say that there was no way 
anything could ever go wrong. For example:

  Date: Thu, 17 Apr 1997 09:09:41 -0400
  To: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
  Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Re: |NER| Chances of 4.20 getting busted
  >>if it's going through ticketmaster, then it probably WON'T get busted, as
  >>ticketmaster would not distribute tickets for a venue that is illegal,
  >>unsafe, doesn't have its permits, etc.
  
  >um, yeah, whatever.
  >or is that make money on a per ticket basis?  ****  i forgot?
  >

  Look dude, why are you so negitave?? We have been busting our asses for ...


Never mind the fact that he gives the impression that everything is all wrapped 
up and completely ignores the possibility of a bust (or of the space not getting
its permits, making a bust unavoidable or the space unusable), but he also 
insults the author he responds to (I think it was trouty) who hasn't really 
criticized the party at all. He has only stated the truth that Ticketmaster 
participation has nothing to do with "bust free", but a lot to do with a 
near monopoly on ticket sales for venues and makes a killing on most every 
ticket. (at this point I will let slip that I used to listen to a lot of rock
and stopped primarily when the industry, and other performers, failed to support
pearl jam in there quest to defeat goliath. by the way, anyone out there a fan
of the punk blues fusion thing, namely jon spencer or the derivatives).

So then the party takes place, and a few posts fly to the effect that the place is 
the agora and everyone is freaking out. I don't really share most peoples concern
about the space, but I do respect it and certainly all the bitching seemed to 
me to be reasonable. So I guess the show goes off ok enough and noone has a 
totally terrible review, and out comes C.


His first post is the "what really happened" which has inspired the satirical part
of this note "abducted by aliens". I am not really going to question the story,
and I really don't care, but I will say that the story is far fetched wether 
true or not, and definitely not the kind of thing that you just accept. 

Also, this note never really takes responsibility for what transpired. There is a
"sorry" but not a "sorry I let you down". Instead there is a shifting of blame 
to "the federal government". No, the feds just do what they do, they exist, we 
all know they exist, and it is our responsibility to deal with it. So the note
goes on by bitching at all the people that decide not to show because the show
is at the Agora. We then get this beautiful line 

   I don't quite understand a few things about this scene of ours, it's
  suspossed to be about the music, the dancing the friendship but now it
  seems to be about the space.

This he says after for the past two weeks (and in the very next paragraph) 
hyping the space that wasn't. 

We then get the most wonderful (most groovy bell bottoms ?) all capital letters
which contradict themselves and whine about those folks (consumers) who had 
trusted the promoter and shown up anyway but wondered what was up with the 
space change, as though there concern was not allowed, as though discussion
should be forbidden.

C's next note is to curse out trouty (again). I might quote but the disrespect
is a bit strong. I guess bleep bleep bleep is close enough.


The last note I got from C was this (lots of capitals) bitch at some guy 
michael which brings us to another great quote:

                                  THAT'S PRETTY CLOSED MINDED, YOU
  MISE WELL BECOME A JOCK, DRINK BEER AND WATCH FOOTBALL ALL DAY!!

(I am actually being sincere with my appreciation for this one).

The note ends with the:

  I HOPE YOU TAKE THE TIME TO THINK THE SITUATION OUT, AND UNDERSTAND THJAT
  SOMETHINGS ARE OUT OF YOUR CONTROLL!

At this point, I will save trouty the trouble here and interject that about 
all we (consumers) can do is "know your promoters skilz". Did I get that 
right trouty.



................................................


Ok, so now the moral to my long winded story.

First off, no disrespect to sleepy, even though it sounds like I am.


My purpose in this note is too discourage the practice that seems to have
arisen lately of jumping all over anyone who offers a dissenting opinion.
Free speech is what makes all things great. Without it, there is no freedom 
of person, of purchuse or of thought. The government can prevent free speech
but so can a community, and I think this community has, by resorting to 
(among other things, capitals) harshness, whenever a good question is asked.
For any party, the likelyhood of a bust is relevent, the reputation of a 
promoter is relevent, the price of the event is relevent. Everything is 
relevent, and the good that the discussion brings far outwieghs any cost 
due to the "bad aura" that might arise around a planned event. If a 
promoter starts to jump all over those that criticize (and the promoters
friends for that matter) then we the consumer must ask ourselves what is
really going on.

A note to promoters: The point at which I changed my mind and decided not
to go to 420 was when C posted that there was no way on earth (save inter-
vention by "the federal government") that the space would get busted, 
so if you are not up front with the public, you will maybe keep some 
momentum going, but for sure you will lose some as well. Be honest. I 
think joe (187) on another subject said something to the effect (paraphrase):

  If a space is not 100% then say it isn't 100% up front.


Oh, this reminds me. That post by joe was in regaurds to Pete Sysko's (sp?)
comment about the badges. In the rest of the post joe jumps all over pete,
I guess accusing him of botching some parties in the past and being a 
big slouch or druggy or something (this is all from memory so I am trying
my best not to put words in anyone's mouth, but this is how I remember it)
and accusing him of disrupting the flow of badge progress, criticizing 
demoncracy and who knows what else.

Pete's crime: stating that he really preferred maybe a customizable badge.
(this is actually something I am really in favor of, not that it matters,
as I can just print up my own version of it and do whatever I want with
it.)

I find this to be another example of jumping all over someone just for 
questioning the accepted truth. Pete may have been wrong, but attacking 
his personal character isn't really too relevent to wether or not the 
badges should be universal or non universal. 


Let me reiterate: question everything, support those that question even
if you don't agree with them.


.................................................


Ok, a little about me. I have never posted before and I kind of jump in
here with a bit of everything and make some noise and I guess people should
know who is spouting off.

My name is Seth Lytle. I am a masters student in EE at TOSU (the T is for 
The) getting ready to move to upstate NY (on lake champlain actually) 
come the end of the quarter, assuming I get the thesis thing done.

I am new to the scene, first rave was near Christmas. I don't know 
anyone on the list but do read it every day and appreciate the conversation.
I especially look forward to greta's posts, love your reviews who is
the only person on the list I have ever seen - saw her at snowdrift but
by the time I got to where she was standing she was in some conversation
and I didn't feel like interupting. Other than that I appreciate the 
general tension surrounding trouty, and hang on every word out of 
ed's mouth. 

Speak of which anyone know what the deal is with elemental, I thought
it was this huge "collective", but then a few weeks ago ed posts that 
note that explains itself in the one word: e(d)lemental. Anyone have
an explanation.

I don't get out much, when I do I don't talk a whole lot, mainly like
to dance (I am also a light drinker of alchohal, a heavy drinker or
espresso, and a non "illicit" drug user), I drive a chevette which I
love almost as much as the one I drove up to a year ago (that one had
a white hood and about 20 degrees of slop in the steering).

Precedence: bulk

I feel there needs to be a readjustment of attitudes here.

                                      PROPS:

 First of all I think props should go to everyone who made this weekend
possible:the promoters( Sleepy, Spawn. and all) all the crewz( sound,
lighting, lasers), the staff working the bars at the Agora (they put up with
alot of attitudes(esp. Sat. night), all the volunteers that make the whole
thang shake down. I think a REAL LOUD SHOUT OUT should go to SLEEPY C,
thanks for having the balls to pull it all together despite all the SHIT
that was said, and went down. I don't think people realize the dedication,
intelligence, and perseverence that you have to have to throw a major party
of this size. 



                                     DIS's

First off to the Ticket takers and Security at the door(though their not to
totally blame, this also includes anyone in management involved);I think you
need to reassess how to effectively let people into a venue, SINGLE
FILE--CMON GUYS get the FUCK real. A TWO hour wait was something that
could've been avoided!! To all the pessimists and naysayers:If you don't
like the scene stay the hell out of it, keep your negativity to yourself and
go create your own Utopic scene and please stop with the rumor-mongering in
mine!!!


                                    WISDOM 


It's you the people who make the scene, not the lights , or the space, or
the sound(though that helps alot).Without the people there'd be nothing, if
a scene is phat it's because of the people living there make it that way. I
partied in all sorts of cities from the East Coast to the West Coast and
everywhere in between with all sorts of people from all walks of life. The
scene lives upon the individual making a statement through the masses. Life
is not regulated as a constant and sometimes things get thrown out of wack
but it's up to the individual to carry the spirit and persevere. With a
little patience, perserverence, and perspiration(make sure you wear
deodorent) a phat scene could develop through Unity and working together.
Divide and thou scene shall cease to exist!! It's your choice people.


                                ADDITIONAL RAMBLINGS
I did go to 420 v2.0 Fri., Sat., and Sun. I bought my ticket fot $38.25
through Ticketbastard. I like everyone else also was letdown by the change
of venue but I decided to belay my disappointment and go anyway. I like
everyone else had to wait in line for two hours and did not even get in
untill 2:00am. But after I gained entrance I left my attitude at the door
and ended up having a good time. I had the opportunity to talk to many
people I only see once in awhile due to geographic constraints, and made
alot of new friends. The music was phat and so were the visuals. I saw alot
of people walking around with attitudes on their faces due to the change, to
bad they don't know how to make the best of the situation, on the whole I
think everyone there was positive though. Well I've taken up enough byte
space, just remember to Persevere, get involved and make the most out of
your scene wherever you may call home. 
       
                   


                                                   PEACE, LOVE, UNITY

                                                            TOD  ;?

wow this list iz full of crazy drama;
my empathies extended to those who came up short in cleveland.

im gonna waste (or recycle, technically) a some bandwidth here. im trying
to avoid doing schoolwork, for i am in the strangest of moods..and some of
you might enjoy it:)

ive been thinking how
the true stories, dreams, poems and songs of our comedies and tragedies are
an indescribably part of what keeps our soul living with us..
and those moments of madness..being seduced by alien forces of nature
stick out like sore thumbs so we have no choice but to suck on them..

id like to suck on my thumb for a minute and say
that i've found that there are many meanings to the word shady,
and the wisest, most influential, and artistic people are called that or a
similar term at one point in their lives.

in other words, it can be taken as a compliment of the soul and a sign that
you are protective of your right to have it be that colour and value.

here is some prose that i wrote today to maybe describe the way things done
in Dionysian spirit dont always turn out to be what you planned when you
dont plan on doing it for a Apollonian cause (i have no other language to
relate these forces, so i am borrowing the Greek names for the God of Chaos
and the God of Order respectively)::
--------
when we were young we realized maybe that life was not about work but about
art, or we somehow came to realize in some way that the most ambitious form
of life was merely a question of the aesthetic realm
in which we would
from that day on
choose as our home
we had the key to the universe
always shining, vibrating, and glistening
in the moonlight.

our work would be as easy as pie
it worked itself
so we didnt have to
it worked itself
into the way of the webs people attached to you
you were the source of their spirit
the capacitor of their soul
they inducted you king

you were eventually interrogated..
followed, eventualy shamed and scorned, tortured and
were those who tried to balance your nature with theirs..
theirs being the working class hustlers,
the dogs and the bears,
the uniformed crew members
who supply only the chairs
and didnt really care,
though they were the first to tell you
that you were in for a dreadful scare.

they werent a part of your original creation.
they just wanted to be, and you tried to let them be.
and that was your fatal mistake.

according to Nietzsche,
the true poets, philosophers, artists, and creators are the ones that live
in the Dionysiac Substratum, or

..the underground...

and there are natural limits of how much you expose to Apollonians,
the creatures of the sun, before they make their own version in their head
and call yours evil, perverted, dimented and/or twisted.

on the flipside there will always be an Apollo in our life, a voice of
reason, a cry of sanity telling you what you have to do when your so deep
in filth that you dont even understand how you would survive, but they make
you believe what you made them believe in the first place, that the
universe will provide, my friend,
the universe will provide.
---------

these, in a metaphorical sense, are the stories of my promoting career in
pennsylvania. however...a funny twist is that my main flaw was thinking
that "the UNIVERSE will provide" meant the UNIVERSITY would provide....Yah
right *shoots himself in the head*
(oooooooops i did that too early..spread the word that April 27th, 1997 is
"International Shoot Yourself in the Face Day?" for more info goto
www.defvac.com (but i think the server is busted) so CALL 1-800-800-8900)


...for those who are interested in current civil concerns:
Nadine Strossen, National President of the ACLU, speaking on her book ,
"Defending Pornography"
Thursday, May 1, 1997
5 p.m.
HUB Assembly Room
University Park, PA

which means..
im gonna have a chance to shake hands and bullshit with the President of
the ACLU! if any promoters who have lost their civility as a promoter
(escpecially dealing with money concerns) through discrimination would like
to personally address her with this issue afterwards, id be glad to
actually hand her printed out documents of stories like sleepy c's
it strikes me that the more open we are about being against discrimination
by cops and zoning authorities, the more likelihood that one of our stories
might actually get the publicity neccessary for a supreme court case..just
a thought.

if not at this time, i simply encourage you, Stephen Cinch, and others like
you to consider speaking at dc at that protest rally thing (when is that
anyway? i forget..sometime in August?), now that i hear they actually have
some positive publicity around there from RAVEON5133's post about
Washington Post.

ill continue to be rambling on....sometime else i suppose..
chow.

I normally do not post this kind of message but, watching all the crap fly
on
pb-cle about 420 (good and bad) has prompted me to do so.

Sleepy C is a good friend of mine.  We've both been active in the Cleveland
(and outside) rave scene for a long time, going on OVER SIX YEARS.  How
many people can say they've been doing that?  How many people who are
displaying a negative attitude towards it have even been in the scene that
long, or have tried to throw a BIG party?  The logistics of it can be
overwhelming without having any training in such a thing.  What do you
think makes a good party?  The DJs alone?  THe lights?  The space?  The
security?  It all combines...you have to try to manage the whole enchelada
balanced on a proverbial pin point.  THere's a lot to think about and
consider when you do a big party...any party...if you want a successful
event.  (Successful here means ones that the kidz who attend, the
promotors, the entertainment, and hell, everybody wins.)  Anyone with
business training or sense will know that you can't underprice OR
overprice...and one the pivotal parts of the equation is LOCATION LOCATION
LOCATION...We all agree that the Agora, as a rave space, hell, even as any
kind of space, just plain sux.  We've known this for quite some time.  So
why risk alienating ravers by just up and moving the venue of 420 there and
basically cut the jugular on the party?  IT WAS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF
SLEEPY -- AND ANYONE IN THE RAVE SCENE.  To those who dissed the party
because of the venue...well, you should have thought about why it would be
moved there...and still supported it...

Face it, what's happening is that the rave scene is undergoing what
happened to Rock and Roll when it started getting big...that's right
kiddies, we've got the attention of the Federal Government of the United
States...because we are a viable, REAL scene --- and we've got a lot of
negative press against us, vidi 20/20, vidi local news, et al.

Do you follow the rave scene in europe?  They're doing parties that
regularly do over 15,000 people...with the same problems that Sleepy C and
crew got...even more so...imagine the problems with international law...GOA
parties were getting trashed by InterPol...The UK has a law where no more
than four individuals can gather outdoors to the constant beat of
music...the list goes on.

The scene is not just about one city...or one country...it's the whole
planet...

The most important thing to realize here is that Sleepy and others were
trying to do a FULLY LEGAL phat event to circumvent all the problems that
happen to raves.  They got the permits...they spent much $$ on making the
original space fulfill the city/state requirements...including handicap
access...HOW MANY RAVES DO YOU GO TO THAT ARE HANDICAP FRIENDLY?  So at the
last minute the permitting gets pulled...by the Feds...what would you do as
a promotor?  How would that make you feel?  Think about that before you
start coming to obviously convoluted conclusions.

The rave scene that we started working in is one we love.  It started as a
way to join people with many differences and to recognize and celebrate
those differences as a new idea of being human...and evolving past
thousands of years of backwater social behaviour.  A way to embrace
technology and nature.  A way to live and love through the
music/environment that we create.  A NEW EVOLUTION FOR HUMANKIND that would
hopefully be infectious and teach a new, smarter way to live.  I know some
of you are going to hate this, but, there is no longer such a thing as the
TRUE underground.  In the 90's there is too much access to information to
allow such a thing.  The only true underground is one that is a CLOSED
SYSTEM.  History and nature has proven that such systems are
self-destructive, or at the most reach a point of relative stasis.  Our
rave.subculture has been one of open minds, or at least was started under
that tenet.  So don't say the scene's going commercial or capatalistic...it
already is.  So learn how to deal.  The scene is NOT FREE - It costs money
to keep it going.  I spend almost as much as I take in to keep up with
records for my DJing.  RECORDS ARE NOT CHEAP.  Being a musician in the
scene is also not cheap.  You think having hit rave records makes $$?? 
When was the last time you signed a license agreement?  You don't make jack
unless you sell a lot...isn't that just lovely?  The majority of the rave
scene here is hanging on by a financial thread.

We ALL have to be smarter to survive...so use yer brains people, use your
hearts...never stop learning...never close your minds...embrace the
music...

Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

I would like to appoligize to all the people who are bitching about 420
being at the Agora. Some of you think we had this planned all along, but
that is so far from the truth that it hurts me. Some say we moved it there
to cheapen the cost of the show, well it actually raised the cost by
$15,000.00, and because of the space change, we lost $45,000 this weekend.
(this is not  a bullshit statement, we are truly fucked!)

The most dissapointing thing about this weekend was knowing how fat the
origional space was, and knowing how much time we put into it. And then
finding out we could not use it. Im going to list below the event's that
lead to us moving the party to the agora, then maby you will understand
that we really didn't want the show there, but we had no choice.

April 13th - 15th 35 - 40 kids volinteered from 8am till 8pm everyday to
help with the warehouse space, cleaning, scraping paint, building wooden
handicap ramps, moving large piles of stuff around.

April 15th 10 am - Our first inspection from all the citys officials. They
let us know that all was looking good, and that just a few more emergency
lights would get us to code, then they joked about this space being too
clean for our 420 party. (a reference to last years warehouse) We scheduled
a final meeting for April 17th at 1 pm. This is when all the officials sign
off on the permits, (that we applied for 3 months earlier ) and we get full
ok to go on with the show. All the volenteers are still bustin thier backs
just to make sure the space was fat. (We have like 4 rolls of film from the
other space, showing the kids working,the lighting equipment going up ect,
i will try to get pictures up on the net, very soon, so you can SEE how
hard we were working!!

April 17th - we got to the warehouse early and did the few things we needed
to do to make sure the building was good for the inspection, finally at
1pm, the inspectors showed up once again. Harry (from Centrak Lasers) and
myself showed the officials around, and talked and laughed with them. After
about 45 minuits of inspection, all the inspectors and officials signed off
on the permits, and we were legal!!! In fact I gave away 10 tickets to the
inspectors , because they wanted to check out the show. We continued to set
up the lights and adjust the space.

April 17th 5:05 pm - A friend of a friend working at the city's safty
office called us and said he had some news that was just crazy, and that he
wasn't able to tell us, but he would tell us anyway. He said that the head
safty inspector had retracted his signature, and that he left no reason,
and he could not be reached. We all freaked out. With out this signature,
we would have no way to have the party at the warehouse with out it getting
busted. We tried for the rest of the night to find out why the signature
was pulled. We called all the other inspecters and they said that they
didn't know why he would do that, and we were doing everything right in the
citys eyes, so we got no answers. We tried to figure things out till about
5am.

April 18th 6:00 am - Harry and I tried to have a meeting with the safty
inspector, (I even put on a suit, took out my earings and slicked my hair
back, "Corperate-C") he refused to see us, so hairry called him, and he
said that if harry called  again he would press harrassment charges. Things
were looking grim, I started to worrie that 420 would be canceled, after
all the hype and work that many many people had put into it. By 10am, Harry
and I were working the phones trying to get some answers, but this was all
haulted by a visitor.
I opened the office door to see Senator Dennis Kucinich standing there. At
that point I knew the shit was getting deep. He talked with Harry for quite
a while, and then me and then left. What he said made me feel like vomiting
all over the place. Here is what he said, and here is the reason for 420
getting moved!!!

He said, you guys did everything right, you are golden in the citys eyes,
but you chose the wrong building to do this event. It wouldn't matter if
you spent $1000000 restoring the space, the show could not go on there. The
reason being is that the Federal Goverment has involvement with that
building, and it goes way over even the goverment of Cleveland, even the
Goverment of Ohio.
So I did some snooping, and found out that there's some crazy shit going on
behind the scene's in that building, I don't really know the details, but
it is real, and it fucked up our show.

April 18th - The preparty goes off as planned at the Agora.

April 19th - 9am - We now know that no matter what we do, we will not be
able to get the permit re-signed. So we then try to decide do we do the
show there anyways, and risk it getting busted, or do we move it to a space
we know people hate, loose a few people, but let the party go on till 10
am, with no bust. After about an hour of debate, the descion was made to go
to the agora. We all felt sick, but we knew we had to make sure the party
was atleast going to happen.

April 19 - 12pm We released that we needed 3 rooms of sound, so we found
the upstairs room and build a floor for it in like 4 hours, once again kids
volentered and rocked the job.Also Thunder and Lighting noew start moving
their lighting from the warehouse to the Agora, (Setting up equipment twice
does not make happy lighting guys!!)

April 19th - 12am  The show starts, all but Cj bolland show, (His manager
has stold a $1000 deposite from us and a $750 plane ticket, and never sent
us Cj!!)
Even though all the dj's/pa's were their, piles of sound, $15,000 worth of
lighting and the lasers, it still wasn't enough, after the word got out
about the space change, people told us to fuck ourselfs. At the end of the
night we got 1725 people, we needed about 2900 with the space change, so we
are fucked!!
We estimate the loss to be near $45,000.00. Let me tell you, that's alot of
loot!

 I don't quite understand a few things about this scene of ours, it's
suspossed to be about the music, the dancing the friendship but now it
seems to be about the space. Granted the Agora pretty much sucks, in the
situation we were in, what were we to do?? We still had the party go off
(it was fun), and we could of just canceled the show, but we thought people
would understand and back us up, to show the federal goverment, or the city
that a little problem won't stop us,but I guess we were wrong.

I would like to take the time to thank every person who busted thier back
workin on the Richmond Brothers space. You guys were awsome, and we are
going to post some pictures of the work we all did, so that the rest of the
people can see that we had a bond and a unity working in that space, a
common goal of making sure that this years 420 was going to be the sickest
ever, but that was snuffed
by  elements we could not controll, but still you guys rule, thanks,
thanks, thanks.

Also, I would like to thank all the kids who came anyways, you guys are the
true spirit of the rave scene, even though all this shit happened,I did see
quite a few smiling faces, and that was cool.

I WANTED TO GET A BIT NEGITIVE HERE AND SAY A BUNCH OF CRAP ABOUT THE
PEOPLE WHO THINK WE DID THIS SHOW AT THE AGORA INTENTIONALLY, BUT THAT'S
USELESS, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME NOW YOU NEVER WILL, SO I APPOLIGZE THAT WE
WERE FORCED TO MOVE THE SPOT, I APPOLIGIZE THAT THE CITY/FEDERAL GOVT
FUCKED US.


Once again thanks to all who supported us,
Peace & respects,

Stephen "Sleepy C" Cinch

Ps. don't look for many Psychoactive parties in the future, I think I may
just retire, or at least stop for a while, my heart is torn after this
years 420.

I also normally just watch this email list for info and for what other people
have to say.  I agree that the agora sucks, but despite all the bitching and
whining, the main 420 rave was really well done i thought.  The sound was
amazing in all 3 rooms, most of the djs were excellent, as well as the
lighting, and everyone that I saw looked like they were enjoying themselves.
So basically, everyone has to bitch because the rave was thrown in a
legitimate space instead of a way secretive warehouse.  I think the promoters
and everyone that helped make 420 go down deserve *alot* more credit than
they are getting.

about parties in general than you do.  fine.  i'll prolly never say another
word on the subject.  i have my opinions and chose to state them in a
sarcastic manner.  it seems alot of ppl on here _still_ havent figured out

i thought i would start this sort of as an offshoot to a thread on mw-raves
where a few people were talking about the lack of banging 303 tracks out now
like there used to be...

anyway, i had sworn ever since i got into making tracks that i would never
buy a roland X0X instrument (i have kept my promise), but i got the ReBirth
338 demo a few days to check it out and it made me wonder what effect it
will have on making tracks. it sounds great if acid house is what you like,
and it is certainly more functional that a 303 if you don't have a midi/cv
converter cos it accepts midi clocks. within 5 minutes of installing it i
was making tracks that sounded completely professional, the interface is
quick and easy and i can easily knock off two 5 minute acid house tracks per
30 minute ReBirth session (thats all the demo gives beore it shuts down)
that would make average Joe Raver go crazy at a party. it was fun at first
but then a little scary cos it was so easy (and free). i am just wondering
what other people think will be the repercussions of a tool such as ReBirth.
it's not like programming a real 303 is any dificutl task or anything but at
least the people that did it before were pretty dedicated to what they were
doing (acid music). now any Joe with a pentium or PowerMac can crank it out
left and right...i dunno i have really mixed feeligns about it. i suppose if
i thought my own music was really innovative i would have nothing to worry
about, but i dont...

--------------->um....thanks sleepy for saying that for me!!!  you must have 
read my mind!!!  when i first found out that 420 was going to be at the agora i 
admit i WAS a little disappointed, but i fugured  "Hell, why does it matter 
WHERE the party is as long as it's still going on!"  
So my friend and i came anyways...just to have to deal with the LONG ASS line 
and being felt up by the security (i hid my pen in my shoe and my camera in my 
sucker bag!!!)!!!!  which, of course, sucked!!!  but hey you kind of expect 
stuff like that anymore (thanx 20/20!!!)!!!  but anyways....to make a long story 
short i had a FABULOUS time!!!  i met some of the nicest people sat. and made 
some really good friends!!!!  so just think...if i had decided not to go just 
because it was being held at the agora i would have missed out on A LOT of 
fun!!!  to me, it doesn't matter WHERE the party is at, as long as people show 
up to have a good time and there's a good vibe going on......which there was on 
the dance floor where i was all night!
hell, you could throw a party in the basement of your grandparents house and i 
would still show up to dance and meet people and have a good time!!!!


so, in short, sleepy c i wholeheatedly AGREE with you!!!!!!



PEACE!!!!!!

	I remember the same questions being asked when the MC303 came out.
I think that there is still something missing without individual
insturment outs, but the RB338 is still a safe piece of software and
I'm sure I'll buy it.
	I don't think that it will ever replace the 303 or the 808 though.
Besides....where will you be able to get the 'devilfish' plug-in? =)

i think the devilfish comment actually brings up an interesting point, and
that is that since something like a 303 can now be accurately modeled using
physical modeling synthesis that will run on home computers, it won't be far
off before somebody hacks ReBirth 338 and adds features not availble on any
303 or the Devilfish or any other mod, or the propellerhead guys put out
something like "Super Rebirth" or something...adding more waveforms,
different filters, ring modulation, MIDI controller capability...perhaps it
will come to a point when electronic musicians will have to be reponsible
for designing their own (virtual or otherwise) instruments in order to
create an original sound...

Yea.....the hacking potential is really much higher for a program than a
actual piece of equipment....you can easily 'un-do' hacks!

I'm not sure when the midland mayhem thing will be ready but I think the 
idea of having a party featuring the peeps on it is an excellent idea. We 
could have copies of the tape available, get to do another live event, 
etc, etc.
In short, I am highly in favor of doing this and as always the 
projekthaus is available if you all are interested in having it there.

So far as I know Hossam and I still need a ride. Like I said: If you can
do this you and the whole car get:

*Free Admittance to Bassrush IV

*Cool music to listen to

*Interesting and insightful conversation (if you so choose)

*My sincere gratitude

> PS: How about that Steel City Reopening?
>  



yeah, i had a great time...i just wish that starchild played a bit longer...
i love his hip-hop selections
did anyone see him go crazy on the dance floor?  i must admit he's one
of the few dj's that bust a move but than again i saw farmer tea and
1.8.7 getting their grove on too...maybe it's a jungle thing...

i thought everyone's set was really really good...i was highly
impressed.  lots o jungle heads there that night.  mad whistles going. 
i think that was my favorite night at laga...heck it was more fun than a
lot of pittsburgh parties including techniques.  anyways, mad props to
the crew who put it on. 


thanks for a great time,
amy


p.s. who was the special guest?  was it chris?

Same here...Had a phenomenal time! :)  Hopefully it'll keep runnin, but
with that kind of turnout during finals on a tuesday, i don't think
there's any doubt!  

a few suggestions:
 - try to push the speakers back some...the sound was great, but
punishing, at least early on...maybe it was the dynamics of the space, but
it seemed like some stuff was distorted at times.
 - keep pushing the variety of styles...i think folks will like a variety
of mellow, tech, jumpup, dark, jazzy, hard, and whatever other new and
experimental stuff comes out...even having a little bit of hiphop,
dancehall or even acid jazz would be nice to break up the pace...though
strickly jungle is cool by me, i know some of my friends were dying from
all the hardstep...:)

well...besides the fact that you can't sit still to the junglist sounds
(especially the team ripping it last night), it just shows how much the
djs love the *music* and not some sort of glory...though much respect is
due - excellent job dieselboy, farmer tea, 187, sphinx, and UDG!

I just wonder what would happen if, say 20 people showed up with
whistles...i only counted about 4...it'd sound like the freakin aviary! :P

Subject: {pb-cle} bassrush questions...
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

hi there, i had some questions about the space for bassrush.  i emailed
star about this twice before but got no response, so i thought i'd try
asking here.

first, the direx i got with my tickets say nothing about where the party
is, only how to get to one of the "car parks".  anyone know if there is
going to be any clarification on this on the voice mail or anything?  also,
what will be the deal with carry-ins, i have a donna karan water bottle
that matches my outfit and i want to know it won't be taken from me if it's
empty.  and what about cameras?  damn, i remember when questions like this
didn't even need to be asked, i feel silly asking them.  but after everyone
getting basically *everything* taken from them at 420 last weekend, you can
understand my concern.

anyone with any relevant info, i'd appreciate it if you could let me know.
see some of you there?

take two of these and thank me in the morning,
michael

You should make a better effort to keep tabs on the scene; Ritual was held
this past Saturday in the D.C. Armory!  LTJ Bukem was my personal favorite
of the night, with Halo coming in second.  Rabbit in the Moon and Wink also
performed for the 5000 (conservatively) kids in attendance.

>despite the rumors about lonnie not using the name ultraworld anymore.

Well....it said "Ultraworld" on the flyer....

>anyone got the skoop?

Isn't someone else on this list using that name ? ;)

Top Ten Drug-Using Cartoon Suspects:

10. Gargamel (from the Smurfs)
Most likely LSD.  Spends his life in pursuit of little blue guys in
silly white outfits and mentally abusing his cat. What does he plan
to do with the blue dwarfs when he catches them, anyway?

9. Olive Oyl
Probably Dexatrim abuse, maybe some amphetamines. Who is that
skinny?!  She might even be anorexic, she is always giving her burger
to her friend. One side question: what the hell are Popeye and Brutus
thinking?  What is it, her personality?  NOT!

8. Snagglepuss
Can't explain it. Maybe it's the name, or the look, but he is suspicious.

7. He-Man
This is an easy one... I mean c'mon... steroid monkey #1. "BY THE POWER
OF ANABOL!!!!!!" Makes me want to root for Skeletor. Alone in his
castle, hitting the weights. And on top of that he even injects the
shit in his pet tiger. Can we say "Animal Abuse"?

6.& 5.  Yogi and Boo Boo
We all know what is really in those picnic baskets. They go back
to the cave and trip. Another side ?: Are they gay? I mean, take a
look at Boo Boo. "Not that there's anything wrong with that....."

4. Droopy
The number one downer-abuser in toon land. Can't someone slip him
an upper every year or two. The only time I ever saw him happy is
when he sees the picture of the babe. Sort of makes you wonder.

3.Dopey Dwarf
He openly admits it. The other dwarfs deny involvement but they
are under investigation. Allegations are that Doc is writing some
extra 'scrips for Sneezy and all the guys partaking are afloat.

2.Daffy Duck
If he isn't using crack, Marion Barry is clean. He is so wired he bounces around
on his head without feeling any pain. Blows his beak off all the time. Some
symptoms might be from "daffiness" but Haldol wouldn't work for him.

1.Shaggy
By far the #1 suspect. His clothes, his hair, his bad goatee; the
boy converses with dogs. But all of this is nothing until you go to
the Munchie Factor. Anybody who averages 9.3 dog treats consumed per
episode does pot; no ifs, ands, or buts about it. And look at the way
he and his friends painted that van! Pretty rad design, dude.

i'd like to start this by saying that i am in NO way trying to start
another big thread about 420, etc...i waited til today to post this cuz i
wanted to make sure things had cooled down a bit.

saturday nite i was extremely upset upon finding out that the party had
been moved at the last minute to the agora, a space which IMHO is a
horrible place to have a party.  i physically felt my heart sink the way it
would if someone called me up and told me my puppy had just been run over.
given the fact that spawntaneous does nearly *all* of their parties in the
agora, and what i read on the ticketmaster web site, i immediately jumped
to the conclusion that it must have been planned this way.  i then took it
upon myself to write up an emotionally-based and ill-thought-out post
concerning the last-minute space change, without considering what might
have actually happened, nor giving sleepy-c a chance to explain anything.

i regretted my post later that nite after talking to jeff and ed about what
had happened and how upset sleepy-c was about the situation.  it would
indeed suck to work that hard on the space and have it yanked at the last
minute.  i did not stop to think about how much fun i had had at the first
420, which was actually in a warehouse and to this day is one of the best
parties i've ever been to.  nor did i consider the fact that no-one would
have gone to the lengths and cost neccessary to put a lineup of this
caliber together only to plan on throwing the party in a space like the
agora.

i should also mention that history shows spawntaneous as being much shadier
and altogether weird about their parties than psychoactive.  i may not have
felt so cheated if spawntaneous had not been involved in this party, but
the fact that they were just made the change seem all the more planned to
me, at the time.

anyway, i went to the party and had a blast.  the music was kickin' in
every room, ALL nite long.  phantom 45 and odi tagteaming were beyond
words, as were the PA's by robert hood and mike dearborn, adam beyer's dj
set...that guy they added at the last mintue was fukkin awesome too.
someone from frankfurt germany.  the sound and lights were incredible, i
was happy to see they were not using the agora's miserable excuse for a
sound system.  the nite packed a nice vibe and i'd be kicking myself now if
i had stayed home.

so, to sleepy-c and others involved in this party, i apologize for jumping
to conclusions, and basically talking a lot of shit when it was really not
my place to do so.  i sincerely hope my post did not dissaude anyone from
going.  i'd be really REALLY surprised if it did.  actually i'd be really
surprised if anyone stayed home when they learned about the venue change.
everyone was excited enough for the party, that they probably went anyway.

i think i said this a few days after my elemental 2 post, but i'm going to
try to steer clear of the promoter bashing from here on out.  at least
until i'm sure i know all sides of the story...



take two of these and thank me in the morning,
michael

H-47a: AOL4FREE.COM Trojan Horse Program Destroys Hard Drives

April 17, 1997 23:00 GMT 
------------------------------------------------------------------------



PROBLEM:       A Trojan Horse program called AOL4FREE.COM that deletes all 
               files on a hard drive is circulating the Internet. 
PLATFORM:      DOS/Windows-based PCs 
DAMAGE:        When the AOL4FREE.COM program is executed, all files and 
               directories on the users C: drive are deleted. 
SOLUTION:      DO NOT execute this program. If the program starts executing, 
               quickly pressing Ctrl-C will save some of your files. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
VULNERABILITY  Users who download the trojaned AOL4FREE.COM program and 
ASSESSMENT:    executes it will destroy all the files and directories on their 
               DOS C: drive. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


CIAC has obtained a Trojaned copy of AOL4FREE.COM that destroys hard drives.

NOTE: This is different from the AOL4FREE Virus Warning hoax message.


CIAC has obtained a Trojaned copy of the AOL4FREE.COM program that, if run, 
deletes all the files on a user's hard drive. If you are e-mailed this file, 
or if you have downloaded it from an online service, do not attempt to run it. 
If the program was received as an attachment to an e-mail message, do not 
double click (open) it. Opening an attached program runs that program, which 
in this case deletes all the files on your hard drive. The original 
AOL4FREE was a Macintosh program for fraudulently creating free AOL (America
Online) 
accounts. Note that any attempt to use the original AOL4FREE program may 
subject you to prosecution.

NOTE: Most antivirus programs will not detect this or other Trojan Horse 
      programs.

Detection
=========

AOL4FREE.COM is a Trojan program that is 993 bytes (2 sectors) long. 
The following text is readable in the AOL4FREE.COM file 
if you display it with the DOS TYPE command or the DOS EDIT program.

Compiled by BAT2EXEC 1.5
PC Magazine . Douglas Boling

Note that this text may appear in any program compiled with the BAT2EXEC 
program and has nothing to do with the Trojan Horse.

If you open the AOL4FREE.COM file with a disk editor or with the Windows 
Notepad program, the following text is found at the end of the second sector 
of the file.

PATH
COMMANDC earc
/C C:
/C CD\
DELTREE   /y *.*
ECHOOYOUR COMPUTER HAS JUST BEEN F***ED BY *VP* F*** YOU AOL-LAMER

Where F*** is a common vulgar explicative.

Recovery
========

Pressing Ctrl-C before the Trojan Horse finishes deleting all your files will 
save some of them. If the program runs to completion, all the files on 
your root drive will have been deleted. The files are deleted with the 
DOS DELTREE command, so the contents of the files are still on your hard 
disk, only the directory entries have been deleted. Any program that can 
recover deleted files will allow you to recover some or all of the files 
on your hard disk. 

While attempting to recover files, be sure to not write any new files onto 
the hard disk as the new files may overwrite the contents of a deleted file, 
making it impossible to recover. You will probably have to boot your system 
with a floppy and run any recovery programs from there. 

If you happen to have one of the delete tracking programs installed on your 
system (a program that keeps track of deleted files in case you want them 
back) the recovery operation will be relatively simple. Follow the directions
in your delete tracking program to recover your files. If not, you will 
probably have to recover each file individually, supplying the first character 
of the file name, which is overwritten in the directory when the file is 
deleted. Most DOS/Windows disk tools programs also have the capability for 
recovering deleted files so follow the directions included with those programs 
to do so.

Background
==========

The original AOL4FREE Macintosh program was developed to fraudulently create
free 
AOL accounts. The creator of that program has pleaded guilty to defrauding 
America Online for distributing that program. Anyone else attempting to use 
that program to defraud AOL could also be prosecuted.

The AOL4FREE Virus Warning message has been circulating about the Internet 
and warns of an AOL4FREE virus infected e-mail message that infects and 
destroys a system when the message is read, but that warning is a hoax 
and not about this Trojan horse.

1.  The AOL4FREE.COM program is a Trojan Horse, not a virus. It does not 
    spread on its own.
2.  A Trojan Horse must be run to do any damage. 
3.  Reading an e-mail message with the Trojan Horse program as an attachment
    will not run the Trojan Horse and will not do any damage. Note that 
    opening an attached program from within an e-mail reader runs that 
    attached program, which may make it appear that reading the attachment 
    caused the damage. Users should keep in mind that any file with a .COM or 
    .EXE extension is a program, not a document and that double clicking or 
    opening that program will run it. Macintosh users have the additional
    problem that Macintosh programs do not have readable extensions, and so
    are more difficult to detect. Extra care should be taken to insure
    that you do not unintentionally execute an attached program.

CIAC still affirms that reading an e-mail message, even one with an attached 
program, can not do damage to a system. The attachment must be both downloaded
onto the system and run to do any damage.

===( begin transcribed article from People Magazine 4/28/97 )====

* THE LAST PARTY
by Anthony Haden-Guest

The end came one cold December morning in 1980, when 50 agents
from the IRS Criminal Investigation Unit raided Studio 54. They
found, hidden behind the walls of the New York City disco, several
Hefty bags stuffed with nearly a million dollars in cash-illegally
skimmed profits that would ensure the demise of what one denizen
called "the greatest club to ever come down the pike."
   With the closing of Studio 54 went a way of life, an era of epic
hedonism that is captivatingly recreated in this book by a freelance
jouranlist who was there in its heydey. Haden-Guest has collected the
sober memories of more than 200 night crawlers to piece together how
the club, which opened 20 years ago, became the epicenter of 70's
decadence, a place where guests were handed bags of drugs as "party
favors," where Salvadore Dali would sweep in with an entourage of
transvestites, where celebrities such as Liza Minelli, Andy Warhol,
Diana Ross and Bianca Jagger mingled in unisex bathrooms while hordes
of frumpish hopefuls-dubbed "the gray people"-huddled in the street
behind the infamous velvet rope.
   The driving forces behind all this-and the book's central characters
-were Studio 54 co-owners Steve Rubell (who died in 1989) and Ian Schrager
(now a succesful hotelier in New York City, Miami Beach and Los Angeles).
Their starry-eyed ambition and tragic arrogance (after paying only $8000
in taxes in 1977, when the club made millions, they both wound up in
prison) gives PARTY a compelling emotional core. Yet Haden-Guest is most
evocative when describing the magical place itself, a converted TV studio
transformed into a sanctum of unrivaled revelry. As Jimmy Carter's late
mother, Lillian, put it after her one and only visit to Studio 54, "I
don't know if I was in heaven or hell. But it was wonderful." (Morrow, $25)
- Alex Tresniowski

So...anybody still going?  This is sad, but not a-typical of the bullshit
we must deal with in this society.  $20 is pretty good, though, as long as
it's not insanely crowded.  Thoughts anyone?  I'v never been to the
Edge, so I don't know.  In theory, I'd still like to go, as my
finals end that morning (but don't have a ride for sure).

>So...anybody still going?

Hmmmmm....thinkin' about it.....thinkin' real hard....

>$20 is pretty good,

Oh yes.  Worth every penny for Hype alone.  I saw him in January, and
though his selection was pretty run of the mill, his skills are
in-m'f'n-sane. (see also Drum and Bass Selection, Vol. 3)

>as long as it's not insanely crowded.

Well......given the lineup, my guess is that you can pretty much count on it.

>I'v never been to the Edge, so I don't know.

Nor have I, but my friends who went to the Ritual afterparty held there
last week said that the place is suboptimal.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to
go anyway, 'cuz I don't think I'm going to be in England again anytime
soon, and I just don't wanna miss this.

Greetings Netizens,

Due to circumstances beyond everyones control, BassRush is going to take
place at Nectar located at The Edge-56 L St. SE, DC.  All DJs scheduled for
BassRush will still be performing, along with the Nectar DJs scheduled for
the night.  We will have three rooms of music, plus an additional fourth
chillout-room will open at 3am.  The tickets have been reduced to $20.  For
those of you who have already bought your tickets can get the difference
reimbursed at the stores where you bought them from.  We will NOT go over
capacity, so come early.  We want to make sure everyone has a great time. 
The doors will open at 10pm.

Peace ;-)

the new location, the edge, club i haven't been to but once (whack crowd)
.. next the the capitol ballroom (buzz) and tracks
.. an afterparty for ritual was held there last weekend, reportedly 1,500
showed up and the place was extremely tight (no dancing, etc.) [i wasn't
there]
.. 'bassrush' parties usually attract up to 4,000 

good luck ;)

Well,  it certainly was a Bassrush.

I'm a little too tired to craft an eloquent treatise on my views of this
"party", so I'm going to keep it short:

1)  The door price was $25, not $20, as advertised.

2)  Much more importantly, DJs Zinc and Hype were no-shows.


Hopefully, this is the last we'll hear of Fusion Productions.


Or is that Cold Fusion Productions?


In the interest of fairness, there were a few bright spots, including an
excellent performance by Kenny Ken and Warren G.  I am, however, extremely
disappointed that even the very low expectations that I had for this event
weren't met.

heres my kinda late review of Earosion which was friday the 25th in
columbus. the space was the lodge at a camp/resort sorta thing, i really
liked it! you drove out a windy gravel road and ended up at the edge of
this big field out in the middle of nowhere (pretty much) and the party
was in a sort of rustic ballroom at the lodge. nice high ceilings, the
sound was very loud, very cool wooden dancefloor, lighting was minimal but
nice, looked like the same projector that was used at Intimate was here,
projecting weird watery looking visuals on the front wall of the space.
there was no smoking inside, but i only saw a couple of people smoking
inside, looks like everyone is starting to accept the fact you can't smoke
in all spaces. they were also handing out free party favors at the door, i
got a pacifier and a couple of blow-pops, nice! when i got there Steven J
was finishing up his set of diva house. next Blender got up (it was nice
to see a female dj) and spun a great set of hard house and techno. Atman
spun a really great set of detroit/harder techno and threw down some big
anthems that got everyone moving. Dan Efex and Chad Mindrive both spun a
wide range of tracks, some hard trance, detroit, house and a couple of
disco/booty house tracks. i am kinda confused as to who came on when, i
had people telling me both ways, so i'm not really sure. yo Dan why didn't
you throw down any hardcore/gabber, i kept waiting for you to rip shit up!
hehe. i rested for most of walt's set which was mostly diva/hard house.
Trevor Lamont was up last and spun out some really great ghetto house,
which i don't usually dig all that much, but there was nothing you could
do but smile and yell and shake your ass, it was a really fun set and i
had a great time at this party. i'm bad at estimating attendance, but
probably around 400 or so? i think a lot of kids didn't have the cash
for a party this weekend after 420, or there would have been a lot
more. they handed out flyers at the door breaking down the costs of the
party and they needed 345 people to break even at $8 each, it looks like
they did to me. great vibe, space and price, all in all a really cool
party. i love smaller parties, and i got to meet a lot of new people (mad
greets to Mike from pb-cle who i met at the afterparty!) see everyone this
weekend at Funkdafied and Get Funky 2!

I think I just noticed that I haven't been receiving anything from the 
list :(

So I'm resubbing, in case it's not really stagnant...

I just got off of that monster named NE-raves for the summer, but I'm not 
spending this one in Pittsburgh, and I need to know what's up.

For those not in the know, I'm leaving on the 14th of May to New Orleans, 
Louisiana to take a summer class and do up a phat advertising internship 
(wish me luck...)

I'll also be making an appearance in DC on the weekend of the Fourth of 
July with my long lost lover Sara Sawyer (the notorious West Virginian 
hahaha) so if you would like to visit me, in DC or in Louisiana, email me at
hannibal@bu.edu...

I miss you all dearly.

School is bad, and I'm STILL UP and have to do more work...

see you all soon, if not, have an amazing summer...

-colby

I'm supposed to play a party for Brian of UPS/EPT in Akron this Friday.
I'm playing live. If anyone wants to go up I can give you some gas money
and get you into the party. I am pretty sure it will be a lot of fun so
any one going up to Akron from Pittsburgh Friday? If so email me back?

Hello list! I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Heather King, and I
just subscribed yesterday. I'm an 18 year old high school senior from the
Akron/Canton area and I'm interested in going to a rave! I've never been to
one before, and a friend suggested that the best way to learn about local
raves would be to join this list. So here I am! Peace out...   heather

I think 'techno' has become more acceptable to the mainstream this last
year, as is getting a lot more airplay.  Lollapalooza is just trying to
stay on the edge of popular music, ergo, they pick up a 'techno' set
this year.

Hey kids -

  Just thought I'd announce I'm going to start putting out a very, very
small (i'm talking 1 page, front and back) zine dedicated to 
pittsburgh-area rave/techno/future culture.  Pretty much the intention
is to have a paper form of the ROM, but i'm going to have reviews of new
mixtapes, cds and vinyl, radio show info, and possibly some interviews,
event reviews and rants (though I want to keep it rather unbiased for
now).  If anyone wants to make contributions - info on upcoming events,
reviews of new sounds, short articles, or interesting b/w rave pics or
clip art, please contact me (gmmst22@pitt.edu).  

Hopefully I'll have the first issue out and around at the end of this
week/start of next week, so keep a look out.

The tentative title is "Technology".

l8s,
  Geoff/the cut-up kid
gmmst22@pitt.edu
