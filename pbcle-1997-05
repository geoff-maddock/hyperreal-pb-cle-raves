you mean, if you live near a station's own tower, you can't receive said
station due to interference?  that seems so backwards to me...

Actually this seems very practical to me.  Antennas radiate in wierd
eliptical patterns.  My bet is some people around the station get great
reception and some get lowsy reception.  Up close there may not be 360
degree coverage but as you move further away it becomes more radial
(most likely).  Another thing could be the height of the tower.

Actually, it isn't considering the terrain of Pittsburgh. If you live too
close to a station and behind a hill then you can't recieve the signal due
to the angle of radiation off the tower not being steep enough. Living too
close to a station is worse than living too far away in that there is
nothing you can do in the way of putting up an antenna etc to bring the
station in any better. No need to worry, if you haven't already heard, in
the next 5-10 years free TV will no longer exist. Everything will be
digital TV via cable or satellite services, your reception will be crystal
clear but you will pay. ;)

HI,

        I have not heard a word bout Frequency until just a few seconds ago.
Will someone help me out with some information?  There hasn't been a whole
helluva lot worth mentioning around Pittsburgh recently.  I'm sure you
understand.  Anyway, thanks a lot.  

much love,

-Paco

what is everybody so afraid of

Re: New project: www.network23.org 	 


Network 23 is an experiment in "Positive-IT". The aim is to get people
connected and in touch with each other for the mutual facilitation of
missions. The emphasis is on having fun, getting worthwhile things done,
and reducing everyone's  dependence on institutions.

What does that actually mean?

At New Covent Garden Market in London, oranges cost about 3p each. At
Tesco's supermarket in Covent Garden, they cost about 20p each. Tesco's
aren't ripping anyone off: they just take a profit on the fact that
people are too busy and out of contact with each other. Imagine that a
group of people who are really into oranges meet each other over the
Internet. They find that some of them live close to each other. They get
organised and take it in turns to go to the market and buy oranges in
bulk. They can now afford all the oranges they could possibly want, and
get connected to  orange lovers everywhere who sort them out rare high
quality  oranges. Plus, they get to know each other and have a laugh,
eating all those lovely oranges...

This isn't really about oranges, is it?

Well, no. It's about everything. People, music, parties, sunshine,
intoxicants, trees, transport, fiction, information, reality,
surreality, recipes for flapjacks, and everything else.

The Network 23 take on life is that everyone is talented and has unique
gifts : by bringing talented and gifted people together and  sharing
missions, a connected community  can be an unstoppable force.

Network 23 has its roots in the free party phenomenon, and started to
get  organised around the time of the Criminal Justice Bill protest
summer of 1993. Although the vision is now wider, we are still well up
for parties, music, and lateral literature.

Are you lot anarchists, paranoids, pot-heads, subversives, or just plain
weird?

We just do our best, and invite you to join the fun. Network 23 is
non-political, though we do have a social agenda: the wish to make the
world more liveable by getting people together and making good ideas
become reality.

Whatever your interests and ideals, Network 23 is for you. The more
people get connected, and the more diverse their missions are, the
stronger the network will be. 

All mouth, no trousers?

Ha! Trousers all the way. Our legs have never seen the light of day.
This is how it works:

Network 23 has an Internet site at http://www.network23.org, run by our
people in Manchester.

When the site goes live on 23rd of May 1997, it will be the hub of a
global network with satellite sites in London, Edinburgh, Paris,
Frankfurt, Manchester [local site] and Melbourne.
This means that if any individual government censors our content, the
address "www.network23.org" will simply take people to the same
information, mirrored on one of the other sites. This and a range of
privacy and anonymity techniques mean that the network is relatively
strong and safe for its users.

What will be on the site?

(1) Bulletin boards which bring people with similar missions into
contact.

(2) A huge database of contacts, searchable by mission, geographical
location and keywords, helping you to find the people you need to get
the job done - and them to find you.

(3) Information on how to communicate with the people you meet with
Pretty Good Privacy.

(4) Everything you need to know to have your own Web site, whether you
want to link it to Network 23 or not.  If you thought that "Internet"
was what fish did, then you should have a look at this. If you would
like to connect to people and have a project that you would like to let
people know about then it really is a piece of piss to sort out some
pages for a world-wide audience. It should be dirt cheap/free to do. You
don't have to be a computer spanner to sort it out.  Community Computing
is a top way of using the potential of the Internet without having to
have or even know someone with a computer. Network 23 will be getting on
the case to let you know where your local public access site is. We will
explain the ideas behind community computing and show you examples of
how it works.

(5) Information on where community events, parties and demonstrations
are happening. 

(6) Articles and interviews on all sorts of things by all sorts of
people. Music, photos and short stories from the House of Sidegrinder
and other benevolent fools you may not have heard of.

(7) A  collection of interesting news stories you may have missed from
the real world. Information and entertainment that you might not
normally hear about.

(8) The "You Choose News", an interactive game where Network 23 visitors
get to build their chosen reality.

(9)  Underground music network: there is a distribution system called
Network 23 which has been distributing kicking underground dance tunes
for about three years. The site will make this bigger. The number of
releases that have been distributed is hard to gauge as the system of
swapping releases, selling them directly to people at parties and
through friends has become so successful that the central label is no
longer needed and artists press up their own records.  This process
avoids all contact with middlemen, marketeers, distributors and
advertisers. Which can be good if you don't want to deal with that kind
of
shit.

(10) Information about free parties and festivals worldwide. Follow the
paths of various 23 influenced party people as they undertake their
missions around Europe, USA and the  former Soviet Block. This will
include reports from The Unseen Pipe Dream Technical Support Tteam who
will be documenting their mission to Russia in August/September 1997 to
put on free parties, entertain the local communities, meet the Ruskies
and see what they're up
for.

Can I go there now? Can I?

While it's under construction, the site has an open bulletin board where
you can state your mission and meet other people on theirs. You can go
there now,  check out what people are saying, and see if you can be of
any use to each other.  When it launches on May 23 the network will be
global,  but we want to talk about what people are doing locally. We
need energetic, open minded and friendly contributors to get involved
now. There is an open forum on content, so do your bit to shape the
future of the network.

In a nutshell?

DIY information culture.  Network 23 is an alternative non-profit
information channel designed to meet the expectations of the modern Web
user and attract thousands of hits. The network's decentralised
structure will allow us to be uncompromising about the content of the
site. Check your programming. This is Network 23, the network that means
business, now transmitting live to the world....  Please help create the
network;  check out and contribute to the discussion groups on
www.network23.org.
Knowledge is power.  Tell us what you want to see. Tell us what you have
to give.  Tell us Who, What  and Where  we should direct future readers.

Talk to a guaranteed human?

i was looking to see if someone was still subbed.  sent it to the wrong
addy....  sigh. some example i set :o

well the reason i usually hear for closing the who command is to keep
people from making (spam) mailing lists of their own.  in some cases it
sure helps target a certain audience!

usually i agree with ed. but what is different about prodigy & orbital
headlining -vs- jeff mills?   both would have the eMpTyV exposure and what
not in the end?  remember all good things come to an end sometime.  eMpTyV
usually speeds things along whilst looking for new fodder for the kids.

==================================================================

well the reason i usually hear for closing the who command is to keep
people from making (spam) mailing lists of their own.  in some cases it
sure helps target a certain audience!

laters,  trouty....
===================================================================

what a pile of hudda (dats arabic for shit)...don't u think it would
be easier for the spammers to type out 'pb-cle-raves' instead of the
200 and whatever separate e-mail addys of all the people on this list?
...granted on some lists like mw-raves, u need to be subbed on them
to post on them, but it would still be easier to sub on to a list to
make a spam than it would be to type out the over 500 separate e-mail
addys of all the people on mw-raves...but i guess apparently not becuz
i wuz just sent this spam w/ a huge mailing list of mostly people off
of mw-raves about investing is some mall (needless to say i took great
pleasure in forwarding the huge spam back to its original sender - i
recommend for everybody to do this whenever u get a huge spam that u
don't like & do it several times, so u can fill up their mailbox &
make them go thru all that shit)...but like i said i think logic would
kill the spam prevention explanation...i'll stick w/ my jaded cospiracy 
theory...

...u know i'm procrastinatin'...

Remember all the hype about the little fonebook we put out?

WELL...it's just a drop in the bucket in comparision to the whole
project we're working on, you see we're trying to reconstruct the entire
history of the entire US rave scene...to make it indexable, searchable,
and maybe even convince those damn journalists to know what ACTUALLY
happened.

So after 18 months, we have this WACKY database with something like 4500
dj's, 1100 promoters, 1600 events and a ton of OTHER information (i.e.
every occurance a dj has spun at an event...which adds up to over 11,000 
right now!).  The only problem is: we have hundreds of little "blanks".
We know that some of the people of the lists can easily recall the
facts that we need.  Think of it as one MONSTER of a rave Trivial
Pursuit!!! =) And help us fill in these blanks.

If you'd be so kind, point your web browser to:

www.partnercomm.com/~raveinfo/

and take a look at how much we're missing. By the way, rave promoter rave
promoter directories are still available.

Love and Hugs-
	Nicole & Matt

um, no actually, suppose i got the mailing address of every person on 
every rave mailing list.  then i could write a script to mail out a 
message about my 3$ glowsticks (2 for 5$) and mail them out to everyone.  
yes, it would be easier to mail to _just_ the lists in that case, but now 
i have lots of info that has a _definite_ target audience.  why not sell 
that to my friend that sells 12$ dub-mix tapes and they can spam away. 
and why not sell those email addys to say another email addy wholesaler 
that need lots of high-skool-age-and-twenty-somethings?  see where this 
is going. remember: "information is valuable and is not about to be given 
away for free" .......  or is it: "information wants to be free"????
hmmm, food for thought i suppose =)

btw, replying to a spammer _usually_ does no good, as most of the time 
they are abandoned aol/prodigy/compu$erve accts or better yet forged.  
they usually want you to _send_ them money via snail for their services 
or call/fax them....  most ppl that are mad about dont bother.  if its an 
800/888 #, i'll gladly call.  i also love the fax of doom....  teeheee....
sometimes a forger is sloppy and leaves trails back to their system and 
then its a matter of contacting their sysadmin and reporting the 
abuse/misuse of their skool/werk/ISP acct.   

laters, trout......

which one couldn't, at least not this list, right trout?  i mean, that's 
why you've set up the administrative comands with nonstandard syntax, 
right?  (that's where all this 'hudda' started, isn't it?)  thanks for 
protecting my address from spammers.  i've recently switched to a new

periodically, it gets 50-75 emails a WEEK from spam sent via direct email 
alone.   and i just had that email address for 2 years.

Get ready, this is a long one.  :)

As MC Gadget would say, Geeeeeeeeee!!!!  Maximum Boost was excellent.  The
music was 100% top notch.  The DJ booth was full of performers who vibed
really, really well together and who all do what they do very well.  High
quality drum n bass.  I actually feel sorry for anyone who didn't make it. 

I'll do a quick run-thru.  My foremost thought was "The music is sooooooo
good."  Not just trainspotter good with lots of dubplates and respectable
mixes, but a step beyond to that kind of good that you can't put your
finger on.  You know what I'm talking about??? 

J Smooth started things off with his normal good flow.  I heard his
dubplate later that night at an after party and I really liked it.  It had
this slightly sinister hip hopish undercurrent.  The beats were solid and
samples were well-placed.  I was impressed.  Back to the party.  So J
rinsed it alongside "The Lovely Mis-Ty." She sings like a professional. 
She has a wry sense of humor and a voice that can give you chills.  It's
like having a crate of acapellas that match themselves perfectly.  Kpakpo
represented as always and kept up the energy.  Meanwhile, MC Trigger
(Toronto) rolled along nice and easy with a range of styles from clipped
and smart to growling ragga to "git off your asses" hip hop style.
Excellent.

Dallas (TO) came on next and got a lot more people on their feet.  His
first tune got a rewind and it set the mood for a multi-rewind set. He was
sooo good.  He wasn't afraid to play tracks with a lot of really fast
drums instead of the more stripped down styles.  My feet haven't moved
that fast in a while.  It made me really happy. :)  Starchild was reliable
as ever pulling out lots of favorites.  I loved it.  You know, the way he
rolls with energy and a sense of humor kind of reminds me of a Drop Top
Caddy.  :) 

I haven't even mentioned the second room.  I don't know who the first DJ
was but he was good and he spun some new Photek which also made me happy. 
Jeff Knoerr represented and bopped around back there, obviously having a
good time. D.Cypol played a characteristically seamless set of smooth
tunes with nice beats.  It was the perfect chill room of the future. 

Oh my, Pugwash.  It was ok toward the beginning but as he went it kept
getting better and better.  He spun 7 DUBPLATES, no lie.  Oh my gosh, they
were so good.  Pugwash spins with kind of a heavy step.  It's different
and I like it.  Lion was next and my goodness, listening to his set felt
like riding a roller coaster or taking a fast drive down twisty county
roads in a smooth ride, with all the dubby, reverby basslines rolling
around melodic lines like streamers.  It was soooooooo good.  Toward the
end of his set as people were leaving you could almost feel ghosts around
you; like, it felt like you were surrounded by smiling music lovers all
dancing their butts off even tho the room was clearing out.  He kept the
last people dancing until the last beat. 

There were many dubplates and exclusives and wonderful MCing throughout
the night. Oh yeah, *duh,* MC Flex flexed and so did Hugh. they have neat
styles, they just need to be louder. Lorne was great.  He dropped some
pretty exclusive stuff that made people go nuts.  There were rewinds till
the end.  It was so lovely. 

As for the crowd, they were weird.  Half the people were just what you'd
expect, totally enthusiastic, dancing and loving every minute and telling
each other how much fun they were having. The other half kind of sat
around like they were expecting scott henry or something.  When I bumped
into people by accident, half the time it was smiles and hugs, half the
time it was nasty looks like, "What are you doing in my K-hole?" Well, not
half, that's not fair.  When Trigger stopped the music and ordered people
to get off their duffs, about 3/4 of the room not only obeyed, but pulled
their weary friends onto the floor.  It's kinda like that scene in Rocky
Horror Picture Show where they're feasting on Eddie and the audience goes,
"Janet gets it...Brad gets it...Magenta gets it.... Rocky doesn't get it." 
Oh well.  I still had a WONDERFUL time.  I can't wait to hear the tapes. 
Remember those Toronto tapes that everyone was raving about a month or 2
ago?  Get ready for another wave.  I'm just glad i got to be there in
person this time. :)

Many thanks to Substitution.  Respect.

By the way, I don't mean to sound like an ad for brillo pads or something,
but I just got word from Kpakpo that Pugwash tapes will go for the LOW LOW
PRICE of 5 buckaroos to the first 50 people who write to him.  His addy

well, even though this party had a few problems, i didnt let anything
spoil my night and ended up having a blast! first of all: no re-entry to
the space. kinda sucked. second: you couldn't bring your water inside.
this may sound like no big deal to chitown people but i think this is the
first time i haven't been able to bring in my own water to a columbus
party. third: '2 rooms in mack in'. well, if you consider an open hallway
directly above the main dancefloor a 'room', ok. the 'room' probably
wasn't set up until 1:30 or later. the dj stand was just at the end of a
hallway and there were some a few speaker stacks in front of the dj stand
facing to the dj's right. so all night you could hear the sounds from the
second room bouncing off the wall and right down onto the main dancefloor.
it was really annoying and distracting. ow, and i guess i was one of the
first 100 people to get there or something, because i got a free Wilhelm K
mixtape. i think it was a miracle that i even got there period, Wilhelm's
directions were totally fucked up and it took me close to an hour to get
to the space when it should have only taken about 20 minutes. everyone i
talked to said they got totally lost and it took them a long time to
figure out how to get to the space on their own. the space was the Dale
Valley Ballroom, a fairly nice place but it looked like the
management/security were being real pricks, also they were selling beer. i
saw quite a few drunken bastards going around causing trouble.

ok enough bitching :) i'm really not sure who was up when i got there
(close to midnight), pretty good hard house selections, someone told me it
was DJ Liltal. soon afterwards 3D stepped up. um, like what happened to
the 3D vs Danny the Wildchild 4 turntable tagteam?? i was really looking
foward to that. anyways, i was expecting a bit more out of 3D but i still
totally got into his set. spun his usual dark dark techstep mayhem that
i for one love, but there were about 5 people total dancing (including
me). he dropped some killer dubplates but his mixing was really fragmented
and frenzied, a lot of people were just trying to find a groove so they
could dance, but it was a pretty abstract set.

Danny the Wildchild was up next, starting out with a little techstep then
moving on to fairly dark jumpup and then finally exploding with the
gangsta sample stuff all the kids love, really started to get a lot of
people moving.

Frankie Bones then spun a close to 2 hour set, not much else to say but
typical Frankie, lotsa killer hard house and detroit tracks, he had the
place really going crazy.

Paul Johnson got up next and proceeded to make everyone go totally nuts.
i don't think there was a person in the entire place that wasn't smiling
and cheering, the vibe was thick and a totally fun set.

Micro tore shit up, hard techno and pounding detroit tracks with a little
hardtrance mixed in for some huge buildups, i loved every second of it.

Spookie (i thought he was supposed to be in the 2nd room?) spun some
really downtempo house/blunted beats/whatever. most people just kinda
chilled for this set. after Frankie, Paul and Micro i was pretty beat.

Wilhelm K was last of course, a really fun house set that got me back up
on my feet after a long, long night of dancing.

i'm confused as to Mellowman and Dara, did they show? i guess Frankie spun
the extra long set to make up for someone, and then they brought Spookie
out to the main room. i didn't get to catch much of the second room. i
heard the start of Doc Scott's 'Fabio's Ghost' (woo, i love that song!)
reverbing from the second room during a quiet part in Frankie's set and
ran upstairs to hear divine from the justus crew ripping shit up, he was
really good but they were having some sound problems so i didn't stick
around for too long. plus i dont like dancing on carpet all that much.

all in all, Frankie, Paul Johnson and Micro more than made up for all of
the problems the party had and i ended up having a great time. it was
really cool getting to meet a lot of people from indy and beyond who made
the trip for this party. i'm glad the party somewhat came together (for me
at least), i actually felt like i was getting my $20 worth, the djs were
all terrific, and the sound/lights (looked like the same setup from Get
Busy) rocked...anyways, thats my review :)

get funky 2 was held in the valley dale ballroom.  a bit of a sentimental
place for me, as it was where my first _huge_ (i.e. not a house party or
200-300 person event) "rave" was (biosphere, oct 94) and i had not been
back to that space since.  strange, i remember the space being a lot
bigger.  at least the water was running this time!

we arrived early, tho not as early as we wanted to (i wanted to check out
liltal and not miss any of danny the wildchild/3D).  bout 12:20-12:30ish.
:P anyway, not a lot of ppl there yet.  3D was fukkin it up on 2 tables by
himself, as opposed to tagging with danny the wildchild on 4 decks.  oh
well.  he still wrecked shop, and i'm not sure how their styles would mesh
anyway.  dara went on after him.  this is the first time i've seen dara and
known who was on/who dara was, etc.  killer set, and he looks crazy to
boot. ;)  opened with a remix of "can't knock the hustle", he also dropped
ss' "silver" and "gold" (btw different ppl keep telling me different things
about which one is which, but he played them both so i guess it doesn't
matter).  not the absolute freshest selection, but he played a lot of tunes
i really dig, so i liked his set a lot.

before i move on, i have to say that the crowd response (or lack thereof)
to both the jungle dj's was very dissapointing after being in d.c. last
week.  at bassrush it was all about 1500 kids with their lighters in the
air...whistles, horns and screaming filling the room and everyone dancing.
then i come back to the midwest and about 1/4 of the ppl bothered to dance.
ah well...

frankie bones spun a really nice hard techno set that didn't seem as long
as it was.  he even played a little booty. :o  paul johnson followed him
and, as always, immediately got me smiling and shaking my ass ("damn!  you
got a fat ass!  you got a big ass!  you got a ghetto booty!").  i wish he
had just played the rest of the party :P  micro was alright, but basically
a waste IMHO, when you have talent such as 3D only spinning 30 minutes and
PJ only getting an hour.  why not knock a few dollars off at the door and
give them longer sets?  i dunno.  micro just wasn't much my thing.  good,
but every record he played had what we used to affectionately refer to as
the "jerkoff breakdown".  that is, a long-ass drawn out spacey breakdown
that makes you say "what am i supposed to do now, jerk off?" ;P  wilhelm
finished the nite with a decent set.  turned the table off and let his last
record grind slowly to a halt and proceeded to play dj ez-rock and rob
base's "it takes 2" as the lites came on.  presuming that was going to be
the track to end the nite, i was happily surprised when i suddenly heard
him slam into "let me see that pussy work".  he got to play about 3 ghetto
records before the cop made him shut it off.

all in all, worth my 20 bux, a fairly decent party.  i just think the dj
time slots were poorly planned, not to mention the 2nd "room" was
impossible to hear in.  the only dj i checked out up there was misfit,
anyway.  must've been hell to try to mix up there.  hmph.  not too many
people decided to show up in full on mack daddy garb, tho titonton had his
extremely pimpin shoes and ed had somethin crazy going on! (;) ed)

--track ID ?'s
  1) clubby house, PJ and wilhelm both played it.  breaks down into "ya
bettah runnnnn...run run RUN!" etc etc and then has a wikkid little
descending then ascending tone (best i can do! sorry) before the beat comes
back in.  semi-popular currently.

  2) hardstep jungle, dara played it.  remix of some hip hop song that i
faintly recognized.  "can i get a yes? YES!"  and it fucking made me lose
my shit.  i think r notorious j dropped this one on bassrush as well.

take two of these and thank me in the morning,
michael

just fill this out and i'll send you a small batch of flyers for this
event.  this mailout is not so much intended to promote the event itself
(it's probably too late for that, typical me ;), but it is intended to
promote the concept of combining live music, and the more serious ideals
of art, within the confines of the electronic music/event experience
(i.e., party, rave, whatever).  got that?  good...heh.  anyway, here it
is: 

full name - 
street/number - 
city/state/zip code - 

if you want a few extra to spread amongst your friends or your local
hangouts, let me know, but be specific about how many you want.

keep in mind that i do honor about 90% of these replies but sometimes i
run out of postage money or addresses get lost.  

thanks for being interested!

5. Slang. A dismal failure; a fiasco.
6. Slang. An old car.
7. Chiefly British. A large amount of money.

-bomb v. bombed, bomb0ing, bombs.
-tr.

1. To drop a bomb or bombs.
2. Slang. To fail miserably.
3. Slang. To paint a graffito

well....now that greta decided to flame me not only in person but on the
list as well, i will fully explain the discourse which lead to this.......

first i will say i was terribly misquotes....oh btw, i am the "person on
the list who shall remain nameless"

as far as what i was  quotes as saying all jungle has only 3 drum
sequences.....what i said was, a friend was telling me about three major
(not only) sequences called the amen sequences, or amen breaks, or
whatever.....i didn't even insinuate that this globally encompassed all
drum and bass, past, present or future...i know very little about jungle
and will be the first to admit it....i was just sating of what i remembered
of  a discussion from a frien a few months before, and i said that i was
restating from memory third hand information and told her she should
discuss it with him.............

ok, this is funnee....the 4/4 thing.....what i remember was that i was the
one who said all techno was 4/4 or would be very difficult to mix, the main
gist of this argument was greta said breakbeat and jungle specifically was
not 4/4......i say this is funnee coz she quoted me as saying the exact
opposite of what i did say but publisized it first so now it probably look
like i am BSing..oh well

grow up greta..

	 *** Attention Trance, Acid, Goa & Hardcore DJ's ***

Text:

Hey you!

Hope that the day bring the best in ya out there.  This is Dj Anakin
from Rebel Alliance Sound, and firstly I apologize for the waste of
bandwidth on your servers mailistings (tho I really don't know how to
get to other Dj's besides this forum...).

Secondly I'd like to take a bit of your time and ask a favor:

	A few of us out here in CA has devised a little way to attempt to
spread our sound across the world.  We're trying to assist the scene to
grow, properly, from it's fragmented little pockets of DJ's to a
nation-wide union of sorts in order to share our information & move the
trance, acid and hardcore scene in a positive light.  We're planning to
do this via web sites.  On our web site, we're intending to get a
national database of DJ Biographies (including contact information #'s,
and possibly a 10 min mix on Realaudio), music reviews, as well as Scene
reports (i.e. party reviews) from around the nation.  We need your help
tho!  We're pretty much set over here for Bay Area CA.  But we'd like to
have input from all over the states and possibly the world.  This is a
TOTAL non-profit venture, mainly organized and run by DJs from within
that feel the time is now to bring the ones true to the scene together. 
	
What We Need From You... 
	If you feel that you would like to be apart of this, please reply to
Aguevara@rely.com and I'll will contact you. 

What You Get...
	Your own webpage- included is DJ name, State, Style of music, Contact
ph#, a 10min mix (optional).  Possibly a picture too.  We're attempt to
make this website user friendly in the extreme as well as really nice to
look @ (hey, we're ravers too...).
We feel that if promoters need to book a DJ anywhere all they need to do
is go to our site and find their state.  BAM!  A listing of DJ's are @
their disposal. 
	Also, If you want to submit reviews of parties in your area or record
reviews...  Please do so.  They are much needed, it helps other DJs gain
a glimpse of the scene in your area as well.  

As you can see we're trying to maintain the web site for information on
two levels (promoters, and DJ's) with hopes to expand our database for
all to enjoy.

Right now, we think in order to express the scene appropriately, it is
necessary to take electronic music one genre @ a time.  All of us here
have much respect for our Deep House, Drum and bass, Breaks and Ambient
DJ's as well as other DJ's that haven't been categorized as of yet..
However to keep a focus, we are promoting the style that we show
interest most. In time we will expand or link a site of other styles
onto ours...
If you feel that you would like to be a part of this venture please get
back in touch with myself and thanks for your time...

--_Adam (Aka Anakin)
"Awaken"

P.S.  If people could also forward me the Address of other regional Mail
lists, It would be greatly appreciated.  As we wish to contact as many
DJ's of our style as possible...  Also, If you know of a DJ that Doesn't
have Email access and would like to be on our list, forward a means to
contact him / her and I'll attempt to contact them...

most all electronic music with a beat comes down to a 4/4 beat.  or 
something similar.  the jungle i owned had a underlying 4/4 with snares 
all over the place (fwiw, i traded it all for gabber =) ...  whether 
she's trying to say jungle is "harder" to mix because its not 4/4 or not 
can be implied from this i suppose.  the jungle stuff i had was in the 
155-175 BPM range and i just never got the knack for "proper" mixing of 
it, the snares and other stuff just sounded like machine guns and i 
couldnt pick out anything to match beats on.  needless to say i dont have 
much of an ear for that sort of thing.  =)    ...  i'm not going to say 
much else on the topic and leave it at that.

> grow up greta..
i'm not touching this one.

appropriately and update your bookmarks.  also i broke it up into 
sections.  ....   events, weeklies, info lines, and radio shows.  right 
now i'm only going to mail out the events section,  email if you want it 
to all go out in one email as before.

theres alot of junk in there that isn't happening, but not sure on the 
specifics.

Just as you thought you were safe...  Just as you thought the insanity and
madness were gone forever...  

Tardcore Mssive Proudly presents:


               !!!!!!!!     SYSTEMS UPGRADE     !!!!!!!!

Sunday, July 13th, 5pm - 1am...

Info Line: 1.800.311.4212 then dial 410.499.0239. (it's not as complicated
as it seems.  I know you gus can do it.  I have faith in you)

With software technitions:

Main Room:

-----d.Cypol, Pittsburg  (happy hardcore)
-----Bliss, Baltimore    (hard acid trance/hardcore)
-----Hi Octane, Baltimore(hard acid trance)
-----1.8.7., Pittsburg   (jungle)
-----Beatty, DC          (goa trance)

Bass-ment (NERF-gun warfare arena)

----Vu, Baltimore        (techno)
----Pez, Baltimore       (techno)
----Bob Blitz, NJ        (techno)
----Hybrid, Baltimore    (trance)
----Space Invador, VA    (acid brakes)


Admission:  $13      OR      $11 if you bring a NERF-gun with you.

**The BASSment of this venue has many very small side rooms.  It's amlmost
like a labirinth, which makes it a perfect ground for full out NERF-gun
warfare action.  So steal your little brother's NERF-gun and bring it to
the party ans save to bucks!
          
**Most of the line up none of you probably ever heared of.  That's the
point!  Tardcore Massive is dedicated to giving young kids a chance to
spin out and show off their skills.  Don't be fooled by the fact that
these kids are not famous.  Every one of them is an exellent DJ, who is as
good if not better than most of "big names" out there!

**Yes, it's a Sunday day party...  With the current state of matters in
Baltimore, it's much easier and less likely to get busted this way.
Besides, remeber Sunday Mass about a year ago, before it became a
crackhouse?  Vibe so thick, you could almost see sparks of pure energy!
This is how it's gonna be, only this party is gonna have better music and
much more crazy shit going on!

Rage on!
Hi Octane

friday 9 may, columbus ohio - from ele_mental comes 

(PHYLOS) - an experiment in sound and structure


directions:

here's a shortcut for columbus people, otherwise skip this part...

from points in or near the center of columbus, get to 71 S.  take 71 S to
70 W, follow 70 W for about 6 miles to the WILSON RD exit (exit 94), and
go L.  follow wilson rd S for about 2 miles, or 5 lights.  after going
over a long highway-type of rise in the road you will get to the 6th
light, which will be SULLIVANT AVE, go R.  follow sullivant going W for
about a mile, pass a pizza hut, and then look for the national guard
armory at 4094 sullivant ave.  park, and enter through the side door. 

out-of-town directions:

from the NE take 71 S to downtown columbus, find 70 W and stay on it for
about 8 miles.  find 270 S and follow it about 5 miles down to the
GEORGESVILLE RD exit, exit #5, then take a L. 

from the NW take 23 S to 270 W, follow 270 around for about 15 miles to
the georgesville rd exit, exit #5, take a L.

from the S take 71 N to 270 W, follow 270 for about 5 miles to the
georgesville rd exit, #5, and go R.

from the W take 70 E to 270 S, follow 270 for about 5 miles to the
georgesville rd exit, #5, then go L.

from the E take 70 W to 270 S.  follow 270 around for about 15 miles to
the georgesville rd exit, #5, and go R. 

once everyone is on georgesville rd heading N, follow it for about 2
miles, or about 6 lights.  at the 7th light look for a U-haul, and take a
R at SULLIVANT AVE.  follow sullivant for about a 1/2 block and look for
the NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY on the L, 4094 sullivant ave.  park and enter
through the west side doors.

admission will be $12, or $10 with a useful clothing or dry/canned food
donation.  a portion of the proceeds of this event will go towards charity. 

no weapons, markers, alcohol, drugs, or glass bottles will be permitted
into the event.  smoking is also highly discouraged. 

the space is very big and had nice clean concrete floors.  in addition to
the main room of music will be a second atmospheric room presented by the
(23) media collective, featuring an audio installation and live visuals. 

the event will go from about 11 PM - 7 AM and perhaps a little later.

any problems, call 614.470.0929 ext 1.

Whilst surfing the 'net... I found this piece of interesting
microcode...you
can emulate an analog synth, like a 303, and record 'sessions' of it out to
.wav files.  Unfortunately, it only is on PCs, no MACs :(

this is a bad week...+ an even worse day...that is getting worse again
by the minute. i'm really pissed off at many people especially my
professor who told my class the lab closes at 9pm but it actually closes
at 4pm, so i didn't know this & went in there at 3:15 to finish my
project but there's not time & today is supposed to be the last day
it's open. i'm so sick of dealing with this bullshit...

i will not disclose why i'm asking, but would it be possible for
anybody to pick me up on the way to phylos (columbus) or II
(youngstown)?

okay, this is something i've noticed in several other people's cars before
so i thought i might bring it up.

anyone have a cassette deck in their car that does not play quite fast
enough?  like it's on -1/2 or -1?  anyone know any ways of alleviating
this?

take two of these and thank me in the morning,

Hello everyone-
	Within the past week we have gotten an incredible response...we
realize scrolling through 2500 dj's is a headache, but with your direct
help we have already reduced that from 2500 to 1850 (you veterans out
there have really kicked some ass)!
	We now have eight areas where we are seeking information.  Most
recently, we added dj birthday's...this is in order to offer an "one this
day..." announcement on our web site--we think that'll be fun! =)
	We are applying your answers almost as fast as they come in and
we can't thank you enuff for your support!  If you haven't done so
already, stop on by and check it out at:
		http://www.partnercomm.com/~raveinfo/
Love-
Nicole & Matt
(Angel& Cyphonix)

dan, you ignorant FOOL!!

now that you have spread the unholy instructions of how to view mr.clean
in any well scrubbed surface, his visage is sure to pop up ALL OVER THE
WORLD!!!  do you know what you have done!?!  you have spread an
information virus that is sure to bring down our shampoo imports as ravers
all acrosws the land shave their heads with the divine inspiration they
will soon receive from their floor tiles.   now we will be faced with an
epidemic of ravers with shorn heads.  SHORN HEADS SHORN HEADS SHORN
HEADS!!!  how horrific.   fortunately, when you say "shorn heads" three
times in the dark you get nowhere so there is no problem with me doing
this.

but YOU!! oh no, you have done a terrible thing! bad dan!! bad, bad dan!!
like i said before mr. clean is not the devil.  no, he is something MUCH
worse, he is god!!!

don't piss off god, dan, he hates making housecalls and you will cause him
to make many more!! bad karma, my friend, i'll see you in hell

find youngstown on a map.  look for i-80
get on i-80 towards ygn.  

from cleveland you will get off at the belmont ave (rt 193) exit ... watch
for the tight turn on the ramp.  at the bottom of the ramp there is a
light.  go right.  there is another light by an econo lodge, turn right
there.  skip down a bit....

from pgh, get on i-80 and head west.  get off at the belmont ave (rt 193)
exit and turn left at the bottom of the exit ramp. 

once on belmont go thru ~5 or so lights.  there will be a fork in the road
at a light with a beer drive thru place _directly_ ahead of you.  veer to
to left and stay on belmont.  dont go down wirt st.  that'll get ya lost!
go down belmont and once you're going down the hill towards downtown, you
will see a home savings and loan building (shaped like a bell at the top).
head towards that.  at the bottom of the hill turn left onto west federal
(also called martin luther) and the space is 3 doors down from home
savings, next to plaza optical.  the addy there is 263 w. federal.

hope to see a few of ya there....   trouty....

i might be jumping the gun here, but i think getting a new tape player will
solve the problem.  ;)

seriously though, it is sitehr one of two things.  the motor is on it's way
out (which is usually the case, such as in my car), or the azimiuth needs
adjusting.  this is pretty damn tough in a car stereo.  you'd have to take
it somewhere to get it done.  usually azimuth only affects the quality of
output, not speed.  either way, in both cases it would be more cost
effective to get a new deck.

Not only that but the word is that MixMag USA will be there to do a cover
story(!) on Steel City so lets show them how we represent out this way.   
Ohio people, don't be a fraid to come you are more than welcome. Also I   
believe that UDG is going to be doing this thing where if you are on their
mailing list you will get in free if you bring a paying friend. How does  
one get on the mailing list? Call 412.761.8173 Lets give dieselBoy a
proper send-off and fill the place with smilin' faces.

Joe

Hello all...

Just wanted to send a quick note and say "Hey ... I'm back!".  I went on 
vacation last week to Boulder and had a beautiful time.  I met some nice 
people, did a lot of rock climbing, got a mad suntan, drank many good 
local brews and sampled some of the local vittles and chitterlins.  I saw 
a flyer for our very own DJ Deadly Buda, but unfortunately the rave he 
was playing at was the night I left, so I didn't get to check it out.  
Let me tell you, there's a lot of hippies in Colorado :-)

However, I did get to see The Orb in Denver.  It was a killer show, in a 
nice theatre, with a great sound system, three video projectors and lotsa 
lights.  The show was pretty intense and very trippy, as you might 
imagine an Orb show being.  That was about it for night life, though.  
There are no clubs in Boulder that I could find that had DJs worth 
hearing.  I bought some Jungle at a record shop, but the salesman said 
that there was no chance I could hear anyone spin Jungle in Boulder.  Oh 
well ... good thing I brought mixtapes with me!

All in all, I have to say I missed my friends back here in 'ole Pixburgh, 
and I *really* missed my email.  I tried all week to find a telnet 
session to no avail.  I'm glad to be back and to be connected once 
again.  I missed you guys :-(

So, what did I miss while I was gone?  How was Frequency?  How was 
SteelCityJungle #2?  Anything else cool happen while I was gone?  I read 
some posts about Fox53 doing a special on Raves ... did anyone tape it 
and can I borrow a copy if you did?

Anyone going to Tekno Dome on July 12th? Looks like a phat show. Went to
a party in Asbury Park, N.J. on Saturday - higher level shit...
Japanese really know how to party. The GOA sounds were intense, and the
visuals were mind boggling. I'm from Philly, so if anyone has local
info, let me know.

Ok, I've been seeing all the negative and positive stuff fly since MTV has
had
amplive@aol.com drop in on our lists.

EVERYONE:  Banning someone with marketing power and influence like MTV
would be IMHO a terrible _mistake_.  What we should be asking is:

Is MTV supporting or compensating for the advertising they're spamming us
with?
Are they "helping" out with the maintenance costs of maintaining the lists?
the web sites?

It looks like this to me:  MTV wants to support the scene and 'break it
out' like it is in Europe, BUT they don't seem to understand the scene and
how it works in America.  The majority of the underground scene has this
incessant _fear_ of it all going too commercial.

Well folks, this is the music biz.  And to survive, you must make some $$,
so why don't the list managers AND all subscribers _demand_ of MTV monetary
compensation for the advertisements, AS WELL AS A HELPING HAND IN
UNDERSTANDING THE SCENE.

Denying someone the chance to learn and understand the rave.subculture is
like going against one of its original tenets:  'the celebration of unity
_in_ the diversity of life, music and the dance'

We are in an information age.  Rave/techno/electronica is leading the
forefront of information media in music.  We must take care that we don't
stomp it out by being a closed society.

	If I advertise myself as a live PA, I'm not sure I'm also going to mail
off $2 to Hyperreal/STD.com for the privilege.  I think if MTV won't
participate in the discussion, they should probably just keep quiet and
observe instead of getting all hip to this new techno thing.
	Not that I care.  I don't get MTV. :)

um, yes, that is the point of it all.  European parties also have 
sponsers like pepsi, and marlboro.  i don't think i want my 20 bucks 
funneling into their pockets.  commercialism is what destroyed this country.
when were times good in america?  when you could run down the street to a 
store owned by your neighbors and not a frigging superworld chain.

understand this MTV:  you suck, we don't want your help....butt the fuck out 
and keep boosting talentless groups like the spice girls and leave the 
flavor to the underground.

are we denying anyone of anything?  is there a requirement to walk

what you see up on a frigging screen.

WARNING: before you read this you should know that this strayed way far
away from the original subject.  Basically I'm just getting a few things
off my chest.

Man you people read into things WAAY too much.  If making a music video 
constitutes selling out then I bet you listen to a lot more "sold out"
bands than you think you do.  Yes I will admit that I am a bit annoyed by
MTV "jumping on the bandwagon" but what did you expect?  You can't keep a
good thing down all the time, and all this is gonna do is spawn disgusting 
quantities of those really annoying "keep it real 
I-was-in-the-scene-when-u-were-listening-to-sonic-youth-and-hitting-the-bong"
type of people.  COmplain complain complain....here's an idea..why don't
you go up and ask the aritsts themselves if they would please mind not
ever making videos or signing to a label that would allow them to actually
eat AND pay the rent.  And nobody give me examples of people that made it
without signing to a major because even so, considering all the people out
there making music, I DOUBT it's a significant amount.  
	Basically it's up to you.  If you stop complaining about it and
just ignore it, it will go away.  Don't buy into it if you don't want to,
but everyone and their brother doesn't need to hear people bitching about
the scene being "sold out" for the 1,000,000,000,000,000,000th time.
Personally, the only time I ever experienced the scene being "sold out"
was at Uranus, where I waited in line for about 2 hours before being told
that the party was "sold out." =)

It doesn't seem like MTV is really the main part of the problem....They're
just playing the videos...Aren't the artists making the videos the ones
who are "selling out", after all they are the ones who send in the videos
to MTV, so they wouldn't they be the source of the problem...If MTV didn't
have any videos to play, then there wouldn't be any AMP... 

later...

 Amen, I wanted to stay out of this but I just couldn't anymore. Alot of
people are going on about things they know nothing about namely the music
buisness. I've been hearing this same mantra of "the scene is getting
commercial",  "so and so sold out", etc since 1992. Don't believe me
youngin's? Read the archives. To us "old-schoolers" (defined as someone
who knew what a rave was and went to one before 1995) this whole this is
old news and most of us, I suspect just hit the old delte key when we see
this thread come up again. You think the scene here is commercial or that
MTV is somehow exploiting it? Friggin go to Europe where MTV covers such
events as  the Love Parade in Germany, the Mayday Rave, the Tribal
Gathering, and the Jungle Awards (yes jungle awards). Do they bitch and
complain over there about it? No because their attitude towards the music
is a bit more mature than the teenage habit of defining oneself by what
they listen to and there fore wanting to prohibit anyone not like you from
hearing your favorite, music genre/group/etc. I think alot of people here
need to grow up and face the facts:

1) While music may be special to you, you don't own it and that's the
beauty of it. Music is for everyone to enjoy.
2) MTV went out on a limb with AMP. You have to admit that any way you
slice it.
3) The show airs in the early morning. Now unless you are a diehard
techno/electronica/whateveryouwantacallit fan you probably won't even see
it. 
4) Only a small segment of the people who buy
techno/electronica/drum&bass/whatever consider themselves "ravers)
(defined as one who goes to parties commonly refered to as raves) The rest
are your average Joe and Jane who have no intentions on going to one but
love the music.
5) Music is music and a scene is a scene, they are connected but one does
not have to: a) be a raver to like this music or b) watch AMP because they
are a raver.
6) Techno sells much more in Europe than the US, why do you think most of
the top artists and DJ's that are American are constantly over there. 
7) If you define underground in terms of what music you are listening to
in someone's basment then you need to check your head.
8) While techno is getting some attention and recognition ist is only to
be expected. Hell people like Frankie Bones have been around doing this
for alomost 10 years with little recognition in this country (while
gracing the covers of many music magazines in Europe and being credited
with having a major part in starting the rave scene in the UK). Isn't it
about time he and others got some respect where the friggin live?
9) If you define underground as something listened to by a small minority
of people then I would suggest that Japanese Koto music is very
underground, maybe you should start a Koto scene? Must something always be
underground and recognized by a few in order for it not to be mainstream?
What's wrong with this zero-sum thinking? Alot.
10)  If you don't like AMP why bitch about it. Just don't watch it. There
is alot of stuff on TV that I may not like but I feel no need to bitch
about it. You folks are as bad as all those people who follow Pat
Robertson and his Ilk and bitched to ABC about Ellen comming out as a
lesbian. If you can't take it don't watch but ton't bitch.



Can we consider this whole thing squashed? It gets old.

So are you saing that any artist that has a video on AMP has sold out
Wow, I wish my thinking and assement of the world was as simplistic. By
"sold out" what do you mean? Do you mean a.) The artist has received some
attention outside the "rave scene",  or b.) The artist has compromised
their talent? I always though "sold out" meant b. Wait a second, isn't
video making an ART? If so then isn't art supposed to be appreciated?
Don't most artists want the world to see their work? If a painting is
displayed in a museum does that mean that the artist has "sold out"??  If
a video is considered art then wouldn't AMP be the proper venue for it? If
not, what do you suggest? An underground network of video pirates copying
and trading videos like mixtapes? That's just stupid. As for making money
so far as I know no one works for free. Some of the facilities these
videos are done in charge a heafty amount and so far as I know, no artist
whose video appeared on AMP has gotten rich from it. You know it's this
kind of f*cked up elitism that has discouraged more than a few first time
ravers from comming back to try another party after being given the
traditional "ravier-than-thou" attitude because they didn't have the
"right" kind of clothes, or "right kind of 'cool ass liquid dance moves'
", or didn't do the "right drugs". It is also what has lead to more than a
few of us old-schoolers, shock, dismay, disillusionment and ultimately
departure from the scene having witnessed what we created as an alternate
reality where one could dance how they wanted, wear what they wanted, do
what they wanted so long as they had love and respect for the music and
the people around them to a new harsh reality of teeny bopper ethics and
elitism. Grow up folks, it's 1997 already, you can't "keep it underground"
forever.  Most artists don't even wan't to. Being underground is nice and
all when you are 16 and living with your parents. When you are 26 and have
bills to pay, rent to pay, food to buy and quite possibly a child to raise
then you realize that not getting paid for something does not =
underground, it just = stupid.

obviously you took my point entirely wrong...
I was just stating that people who continually diss MTV for selling out
shouldn't be doing it...The artists make the videos, so instead of blaming
MTV for bringing this musik to the mainstream, they should be blaming the
artists...I like to watch AMP and think there's nothing wrong with
it...It doesn't matter if this type of music is being introduced on a
larger scale, I think that it's healthy for new people to start listening
to it...If going mainstream means bringing bigger named djs and live acts
to the US then I have absolutely no problem with it...It's all about
the music anyway...Who wouldn't kill for a trip to Tribal Gathering?
I didn't mean that any artists are selling out, its just getting popular
and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it...Those that
make good music should make money from their efforts...

that might have sounded confusing...
later...

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS MY OPINION.
well i feel that eMpTyV is just putting out a feeler for marketability at 
this point.  if it flys well (which as i understand it is) expect more to 
come.  maybe a techno-dating-game-show next =)  ????   the music industry 
generally in a slump now that the CD-sales boom is over.  ppl arent 
buying stuff they already owned on a cassette (or 8-track) in CD format.
the music industry is in a sales slump.  it seems that major labels 
follow eMpTyV's lead and they havent really taken much of one, so the 
industry has been stagnant.  ratings are down at eMpTyV with other music 
channels now competing on those little satelite dishes.  eMpTyV is 
looking to boost ratings, nothing more nothing less.  just looking for a 
new angle for the kids.  i could be wrong.

havent watched it so i cant comment either way since i dont have cable or 
a dish :(   but generally when i had access to cable at my old job the 
only stuff i watched on eMpTyV was beavis & butthead and ren & stimpy.
but i agree with the sentiments.

trouty.

YES! props to Joe! my thoughts exactly. 
I'm sick of people whining about how the rave scene is going mainstream.
It has been for a very long time. Deal with it! Go to raves to have fun
fun, dance to wicked music, and hang out with your friends. Sure, there
are still some underground parties to go to, you just have to look for
them!

as someone who does know something about the music business, and as 
someone who has been a *working force* in love with and employed by the 
rave scene since 1993, i feel compelled to reply to this by saying the 
following two things:

1> i hate the way the rave scene is being sold out. (that is my opinion, 
i typically keep it to my self but i'm feeling a tad onery today.  you 
are entitled to your opinion, even if it is opposite mine)

2> i hate a thousand times more when ppl try to "pull rank" and think 
that just because they have 'been around' for x number of years or 
parties or whatever the rest of us should bow down to them and their 
opinions.  in many areas of my life i feel that age+experience=wisdom but 
my experience with the rave scene has been an intensely personal one 
where i was allowed to make mistakes and learn from them on my own.  not 
only would i not have listened to those kind of folks, i would have 
ridiculed them for sitting around talking like an old fart and not 
leading onward into the youth revolution.  i pray that you will catch the 
subtle irony twists here, and i hope that those who feel as though they 
have been around for a while can either lead onward with *new* and 
intresting ideas, philosophies, and technology or that they will sit down 
and shut up and watch what the young people coming up behind them can do.

if it's too loud, you're too old.

*plays jawbox cd and sparks woooer*

well as far as not participating in discussions go there are alot of 
them on pb-cle. ritchie hawtin emailed asking for permission to post ads 
up here, guess what thats all they do.  dj hardware asking for gigs and 
selling mixtapes, nothing more.  there are ppl that post only when they 
are advertising or discussing their parties or weeklies, or to say how their 
parites or weeklies went.  some ppl have posted for parites in california 
... on a penn/ohio mailing list?  i could almost understand posting if it 
was a super-duper-campout-3-day-fest-in-the-woods sort of thing, but one 
of the far-away events was a party at a frat house.  c'mon.  i usually 
dont say anything since noone else seems to mind and i just hit ctrl-D 
... but i find my left middle finger getting a workout more and more in 
the last year or so.  there are ppl posting their old dj records for 
sale, and nothing else.  there are ppl promoting their record labels as 
well. 

i dont know what the original posting from eMpTyV's aol account was, 
because our little mailing list must not have caught their eye.  *darn*
i would be interested in reading it if someone would forward a copy.

trouty.

I have also been trying to stay out of this thing, but I can't help but
see this whole things as selfishness.  As long as you do your part to keep
the scene alive and introduce new people to the music and the PLUR, what
does it matter what the DJs want to do?

I mean, DJs (great ones) who spend all of their time spinning and doing
parties still arent always making enough money to live on.  THats just
the way things are.  They need to survive.  What can I say? Life is not
fair. If we dont lose the to bigger cities with bigger scences, we would
loose them to office jobs.  Deal with it and support the struggling
artists taking their places.  

Not only that, but just b/c the scene gets a little play doesnt meant
that it'll stop being the scene.  Not everyone likes the Spice Girls, not 
everyone likes everything on MTV, but it has some good stuff too.  Just 
b/c people listen to the music doesnt even mean that they'll come onto
the scence.  Who knows, maybe the community will grow to the point where 
we can support our DJs and keep the parties coming for years to come.  

I guess what Im trying to say is that as long as we keep it on the real,
people will know what we're about.  If people want to come to parties and
pretend thier lives away, then so be it, but we need to be prepared to
welcome the people who have thier eyes opened to what this is all about.
The scene will always be the scene and nobody, not even MTV can stop that.
We need to stop being so exclusive and cliquish and start welcoming people
with open arms like we used to at those old house parties.  

Thanks for listening...

Hey,

        I want anybody here to tell me that if you could make some mad crazy
amount of money for doing something you loved, in this case making music,
you wouldn't accept the contract.  I'm fucking sick and tired of this they
sold out bullshit.  It's fucking human nature.  Put yourself in their shoes.  
        Oh, and yet another thing that's been bohtering me is the fact that
people seem to have to like one and only one variety of music, in this case
techno, of which there are still even further varieties because it is
generally a name used for a lot of different types of music.  Anyway, I'm
not an exclusive techno listener, in fact, my music listening is quite
diverse.  If I find it pleasing to hear, I'll naturally listen to it.  You
have to have an open mind because no one was ever a raver since the day they
were born.  If the vibe is getting new people interested in the music, and
they have the right attitude, then I say welcome them with open arms.  Note
that I ask that they have the right attitude.  For god's sake, I went to my
first rave in October.  I guess that makes me some kind of a loser.  Sorry
greg, but your letter was the last straw.  I had to say something.  Oh yeah,
and to coin a popular phrase as of recent weeks, bitch mode off.  

"Parying is such sweet sorrow."
                                        -Robert Byrne

much love, 

-Paco

OK, lemee start off by saying that I'm not a raver and I don't
claim/pretend to be.  What I *am*, is absolutely in love with
this music.  I first got interested because of my brother who
listens to a lot of dance music, about 3 years ago I went to the
mall and picked up a random techno album ("Welcome to the Future"
I think?), anyways since then I've never looked back and have enjoyed
staying out of that whole grunge thing that shook my high school. Then
I started going to Trilogy/The Church Sunday nights and swear I could
die there happy. :)

My perspective about all this talk about MTV is this. I'm not some
techno guru or anything...but here's what I see.  It's MTV, MTV
is EXTREMEMLY harmless! They've jumped on the techno bandwagon
for now, but like all "MTV fads", their interest in techno will
probably disappear in about 3 months and be buried right along
with the grunge wave they hopped on.  The presence of techno isn't
even very strong on MTV, and I THINK I have an idea why.

There's so many varieties of techno styles that it is about
IMPOSSIBLE to mass produce it to make it make the majority of an
MTV audience happy, ya know? I kind of pick out CD's and tapes out
of the air, and have thrown plenty of them out my car window upon
a first listening.  The length, and the lack of lyrics is what I think
makes techno so interesting.  But lets face it, I doubt many are
willing to sit and listen to 10-15min tracks with no vocals.  Although
I, along with many of you I'm sure...LOVE to discover the groovs
of a long-ass track. :)

Anyways, I'm rambling :) and I'm sorry.  But I think I just wanted 
to say lighten up :) this music genere will be embraced by those
with the patience and vision to truly enjoy it.  Everyone else
will move on to the next MTV fad.

$8 after

if you have any idea of the talent which will be featured at this event,
you know that $5 is an absolute steal.

here's the catch: you have to come, or the more expansive, serious
events which ele_mental presents may disappear...

What is raving?  Did Buddha rave?

I'm particularly interested in peoples thoughts on which spiritual leader
(e.g. Budda, Jesus, Mohammed, Mother Theresa, Joan d'Arc, Pee-Wee Herman,
etc.) that most closely embodies the rave spirit and why.

If u would like to see other ravers answers to this deep and meaningful question
please go to

Does anyone have directions to Neon or know anything about it?  Is it 
being thrown by ele-mental.  I didn't see anything about on their web 
page and in the ROM it didn't say anything about ele-mental.

check out my webpages! they're finally (for the most part) done.

http://phoenix.kent.edu/~gbaxstro/elias.html

also i'm unsubscribing temporarily, since i'm moving, until i can find
a place to get my e-mail on a regular basis. this could be next week
or it might not happen all summer. i don't know yet what my new
address & phone # are yet, but i'll find out when i get there & give
them to probably 1 person per city, who i know (to minimize phone
bills) who can then give them to everybody else i or they know
hopefully. anyway, i'll be back on the list as soon as i can. bye! =]

Nothing to do with "RAVESTOCK" what so ever. I wanted this to be a free
event, however the free site fell thru. We now have a 100% legal and secured
site for the First Annual Texas Electronica Festival and Campout in Dripping
Springs. I will post detailed directions to event site within the next few
weeks. The purpose of this festival is to bring together for one weekend all
the major players in the Texas rave scene and showcase their talent all at
one location. I began work on this event in Dec of 96 and I have gotten
commitments from all the major players to come down to Austin to support
this festival at NO FEE and they all agreed. As a matter of fact EVERYONE
pays the camping fee of $10 for the weekend, other than that fee, this event
is FREE. We could easly ask for 20 to 30 $$ for this line up. Most of the
crews on this line up throw their own parties often exceeding budgets of
10,000$$ or more and my visuals company "DREAMSCOPE" occationally is hired
by these crews to provide visuals at those parties. This Festival will be
held in Dripping Springs which is about a 1 hour drive from downtown Austin.
Dripping Springs is alot like what you might expect, running spring fed
creeks and beautifull hill country surroundings. As you may know Austin is
centraly located in the heart of Texas. Austin is within a 3 hour drive of
just about every major city in Texas so it is rapidly becoming the "Capital"
of raving as well as being the "Capital" seat of government.

personally i dont care how "big" the scene gets... you'll always find me on
the dancefloor keeping busy w\ my glowsticks. but there's something that
needs to be said.. anyone who is woried about this scene becoming too
mainstreen needs to get over themselves. personally, i'm very happy to hear
about dj's taking their first steps out into the real world. Believe it or
not, its a lot tougher to find acceptance out there than it ever was in the
"scene" I've been going to parties for abt 3 years now (off and on) and i
have to say that i think the scene is gonna do just fine...its true, i can
liquid and i love watching other peopel who can do it better than i.. but
as long as your soul is being touched by the vibe and the musik.. then it
deosnt matter hat all how well u can move... i too left the scene a year
ago b/c i went to a party in early '96 that was like 30% newbies who
brought their bad vibe and closed mindedness w\ them... i only got back
into the whole scene this year as a favor to a friend who had never been to
a party... and i had an excellent time... and i think its safe to say i'm
here to stay. anyway.. as long as people keep a smile on there faces the
scene is gonna make it through mtv's [whateverucallit] the same thing
happened to alternative\grunge\whateveruwanttocallit which i still listen
to btw and 3 years later mtv let it go... no id rather see the scene become
more mainstream than it already is... i go to a school where people dont
get it, and they dont want to get it either... but they have NO idea what
its about... liek others have mentioned, there is no such thing as an
underground party in europe.. i guess people there just know how to have
fun.. finally.. to all of u people who think the scene is not comercialized
and mainstream... think again. i'm from new york, and a typical party here
draws 6,000 people (depending on the size of the venue) and most parties
here happen at real clubs.. not some dusty warehouse w\ 2 flashlights for a
LAzER LIGHTSHOW.. i mean come on.. why do people say oh no... its ina
club...... IT SUCKS....? i for one prefer it when parties happen at real
clubs... dont have to worry abt rude interuptions.... the water bottles
(even though they are expensive) are actually cold... i could go on and on
and on. My question to all of u: is it the sense of illicitness [is that a
word?] that attracts u to the scene.. or is it a love for musik, a sence of
family, and the all around good vibe that u seek?? Think about it... 

b4 i go, i have a little story to tell... its short dont worry i'm almost
done... one of my best friends is a goth... i will asume u people knwo what
i'm talking about and move on.. his girlfriend tells me... i have nothing
against ravers.. xcept i hate the fact that its SOOOOOOO mainstream.... 
and my response to her:

well.. goths are next in line.. its the drugs that scare people away from
the scene (among other things) and its the whole darkness\booodslucking
thing which scares people away from the goth scene... but sooner or later,
parties will fade back into the underground and again be practiced by
few... and we'll see a whole bunch of people  who think they are vampires
all over the place... things are in style one day and out the next.... the
same thing happens to whatever is next in line... thats life....  

now just shut up and dance... or enjoy the trip as the case may be.

for those interested...

DR. OCTAGON (!!) is going to be playing live at ludlow's bar in columbus!!
also appearing will be testa.   it's on tuesday, may 27 at 9pm.  tickets
are 10 bucks, but i'm not sure if ludlow's is a 21+ place or not, i've
never been there.  i'll try to find out...maybe some of the other 614 kids
on the list know?  but if it's only 18+ i'll certainly be there...

regrettably, i missed carbon last nite :~(  how was it?  i fell asleep
early due to sickness and when i woke up i would've missed all the PA's.
so i vraved instead.   this is only the 2nd element event i've
missed...hmph.

take two of these and thank me in the morning,

did any of you see the article in (I think it was) URB a while back about
how it was going to be hard for the major labels to market "techno" to
the "mainstream" anyway because they don't understand it?

Got an interesting response to the question of shadows:

"the other side of the Shadow, the light which is the transformation of
that shadow into a gift.  For example, if your shadow is insecurity, your
light might be empathy for others."


has anyone had any such experiences?


saudade,

sorry i didn't hear from you.  anyhoo, the review of oxygen for the list:

nevron was kinda neat, but more morning music to listen to relaxing.  a few
ppl seemed confused by the fact they had _AN_ACTUAL_DRUMMER_!!! :o
it seemed that ppl wanted things to get going and they werent.
blip (keving) was one of the main reasons i went.  man did he kick some
ass!  i hope he made a tape (ed??)  it was really good.  he did mess up
volume levels a few times and seemed a little flustered about it, but that
was the only distraction from the music, which was really really really good!!
citizen was alright, but not my thing so i cant really say much there.
m.c.jones was hard to figure out.  was he serious with his set or goofing
off, or both?  the last song i figure had to be goofing off, since the
ele_guys all were randomly tweaking stuff while he just stood there and
laughed.  ...  great photo op. is all i can say :) ....  the music was
pretty good. all in all.
alion miller was too house for my tastes and i ended up outside for a bit.
rolando was doing some electro which was definately a change!  rarely get
to hear that, but as much as i wanted to stay i had a 3 hr drive ahead and
work at noon :(

oh well.  i hope grrl13's set went well.  (tea?)

Subject: {pb-cle} Spiritual Masks
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk



What are Spiritual Masks?


Jean Cocteau said 'Art is a lie which tells the truth.'


This is the genesis of the notion of Spiritual Masks.  Masks to express
one's spiritual self. Not masks to cover 'imperfection' - not make-up,
rather masks which allow one to express who they are and who they wish to
be. Symbols for the dream self.

The idea of Spiritual Masks  is very loosely based on the teachings of Carl
Jung, who believed there was an unconscious struggle between the individual
and society and used symbolism to explore this phenomena.  Jung's
unconscious being that portion of the psyche which lies outside conscious
awareness. The unconscious expresses itself through dreams, fantasies,
'Freudian' slips and the like. Jung distinguishes two layers of the
unconscious: the personal unconscious derived from one's own experience,
and the collective unconscious containing the universal patterns and images
called archetypes. Our collective unconscious appears through our "persona"
("actor's mask" in Latin) It is the partially calculated public face an
individual assumes in relating to others. The persona is derived from the
expectations of society and early childhood training.  Conforming to the
mores of society is useful both in facilitating contact with others and
being part of the tribe, but can inhibiting when one completely identifies
with it.

Jung believed that we have a "shadow self", like a 'dark side' which
harbors our more primal ideas and impulses. Most would act on them, given
the chance. Most of us repress our shadow, or feel guilty when we "let it
out" - feeling that this part of our being is like an 'evil twin.' However,
Jung believed we should confront our shadow, explore it and make friends
with it, and that doing so would bring sweet rewards. He thought that our
shadows can help us understand our motivations,  inspire us to new
thoughts, and become a source of invigorating inspiration.

The exploration of one's shadow can then become a process of
"individuation." The conscious realization and fulfillment of one's unique
being. It is associated with unconscious imagery and leads to the
experiencing of the Self as the center of the personality, transcending the
ego. It begins by challenging egocentricity, producing the awareness that
the ego is subordinate to a more comprehensive psychic entity - the Self.
Coming to terms with one's Self - of which one's shadow is a part -leads
one to be more centered in responding to social mores, ideals and norms.
Actions not driven entirely by Ego.

A desire to begin a process of challenging egocentricity begs the question
of how does one go about exploring shadows.  This is where Spiritual Masks
come into play imagery to mirror the Self. Sometimes a mask can allow more
of ourselves to come out by hiding other parts and leaving us less
vulnerable. Masks which allow one to paint a tear when sad, and warpaint
when angry.

Art can allow one to assume roles outside of one's 'Self' - and in so doing
see oneself through a stranger's eyes. Dance, photography, illustration,
modeling, theatre all allow one to step in to a surreal playground.


I'm interested in three questions:

1.  What do people think their shadows are?

2.  By what means do people think shadows can be explored? I'm particularly
interested in the interrelation of art and masks to explore one's shadows.

3. Are there any dancers, models, illustrators, photographers, interested
in working along these lines?




For my take on Spiritual Masks, please see:

what's funny about this is that the whole jungle/techno/house movement
isn't something that the majors are EVER going to make any money on
because they think about moving units in the millions as opposed to the
thousands (numbers which indie house/techno labels can deal with...) 
someone on another list i'm on frequently points out the fact that
probably 90% of the music that comes out in these genres only gets played
in some kid's basement..only the few, the proud, da Bomb! tracks make it
out to the light of day..so unless absolutely everyone in the world
becomes a basement dj (something which if it did happen wouldn't be such
a  bad thing anyway...but probably isn't going to happen...) the majors
just aren't gonna make the kind of money they wanna make...too bad..so
sad.....although looking at this month's Rolling Stone tells a slightly
different story...Daft punk/Homework is #10 on the club charts.(these are
club charts that are usually  populated with such hardcore underground
dance artists as...ummm...well...Mary J. Blige and such....and they got a
neat-o little spread on that back billboard page thingy....pretty much
part of the hype i guess...i dunno...proving me wrong probably is the new
chembros album...hmmm...

Word! - you know I'll be there to make some NOISE!

Much respect to dieselboy - hearing him spin out was what really first
turned me on to jungle. :)  I'll be sure to bring many many folks.

Could someone please post the lineup for this tuesday?

Subject: {pb-cle} carnival and masks
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.com

I was born in Rio, where as many people know there is Carnival every year.
In my view, Carnival is in essence a spiritual mask fest. People take on
roles that are normally denied them. Often, a very masculine man, may dress
up as a woman or the poor of the favela's go as kings and queens. Choosing
roles which are very much a part of them denied.

I know there are large rave's [i.e. the burning man ] but are there raves
analogous to carnival - that is, more like a large rave masquarade party
where most people show up in costume?

If so, where? If not, why not? What form would carnival take as a rave?

i'm told the 'love fest' in Berlin is sort of like this - where people
paint their faces? Any one know?

I'm also interested in the application of these spiritual masks like ideas
to other forms of dance and art.

For example, in ballet, dancers also assume roles - but these roles are
fixed.  If one is doing sleeping beauty then there are set characters for
princess Aurora,  the fairy Mountain Ash, Marshall Cantalabutte and the
like. A choreographer taking a spiritual mask approach to a ballet would
allow the dancers to design their own characters and weave the story
together along those lines.

Anyone know of aplications of mask like concepts in other forms of art?


peace,


nik

ppl seemed confused by the fact they had _AN_ACTUAL_DRUMMER_!!! :o
it seemed that ppl wanted things to get going and they werent.
==================================================================

hmmm...wonder if this wuz Jeff Solin, he also played his drums at
another columbus party, Exile's FADED awhile back. Jeff also plays
live techno...as he did at one of the Collective Intelligence partys,
Ohio Players i think...i dunno...i kinda missed the party too...
had a graduation rehearsal @ 9am the next morning & there wuz no way
i wuz gonna drive all the way to columbus, party, & drive all the
way back...mebbe back in the day...but now that i'm older & wiser
and have my head back on my shoulders...don't worry michael yur not
the only one who missed out...for all i know it could've been ed on
the drums...if he had alot of facial piercings it was Jeff (his face
wuz so well decorated he wuz featured on a STAINED SKIN ad) ...if he
had long fuzzy hair and wuz wearing horned rimmed glasses and tights
and wuz tossing his cymbals out on the floor it wuz ed & crew as GAGA

The Pittsburgh crew that went to Oxygen had a great time.  I drove out 
with Amie (grrl13), Ed (Ummmmm) and Jay and we were there until the end 
(Well, 6 O'Clock a.m., which was close enough for me, considering I had 
to work at 1:00 after driving all the way back to PixBurgh).

ANYWAYS ... I enjoyed the live sets a lot.  Sometimes there seemed to be 
a little too much time between tracks, but I know what a pain it is when 
you're on stage waiting for the sampler to load up the next songs's 
files.  That's the reason I usually bring a turntable when I perform 
live, so that I can put a record on while my next song is fired up.  No 
biggee, 'cause the crowd seemed hype enough just to hear the creations.  
I was surprised to hear a live Jungle set, and it sounded *very* good (I 
can't recall who the producer of that set was, though).  After the live 
sets, Rolando spun a nice funky house/electro/Miami Bass (!) set.  I 
really enjoyed that, too, especially the Miami Bass tracks he spun (Amie 
was diggin' it too, back to grrl13's roots (hehe))...

> oh well.  i hope grrl13's set went well.  (tea?)

Amie had a great set.  She didn't go on until about 4:45 am, so the crowd 
was thinning out at that point, but those of us who stuck around were 
very happy to finally hear some Drum 'n Bass mixed up for the 
dancefloor.  Her set started out kinda sweet and mello, but by the end it 
was mad techstep bizzness, and the Technical Itch "Quake" knocked 'em 
dead.  She also did me the favor of spinning some of my dubplates.  It 
was nice to hear my tunes on a big system, and I think the crowd was into 
it as well.  Big respects to Ed for bringing her out and letting us dig 
the Knights of Colombus!

Favorite quote of the night "Wow, you're good for a girl DJ, um I mean 
you're a really good DJ, and it's cool that you're a girl, um I mean it's 
good to see girls reprazent."  HeHeHe ... Amie's a kick-ass DJ, so don't 
test :-)

Hey There,

Just a quick reminder, if you are going to Tribal Gathering this 
coming weekend in Luton, England, make sure to drop by and meet your 
fellow net-ravers at

The Tribal Gathering Net Meet
Global Village Tent
8:00 PM

Just look for the meeting area under the poster which reads "Tribal 
Gathering Net Meet." Over 30 members of our cyber-tribe from England,
Ireland, Australia, and America have indicated they will attend. 

Let's not kid ourselves. This isn't an intimate little gathering we are
attending. Its a gathering of a very large tribe. So let's make it more
enjoyable by celebrating the double-action beauty that binds us: TECHNO and
the NET. That's right - we have two connections. And you know what they
say, two is better than one. 

See you there!

Jammin' James E.

(Please do not reply directly to this message as it has been massively

Mr. Greg Rusnell speaks of Suessian cats:

"Spookie...[i agree with you] ... Dr. Seuss has existed for to long the
unrecognized philosopher extraordinaire of our time. I've always seen the
Cat in the Hat as an excellent representation of Dostoevskys anti-hero. He
is essentially a vagabond and has as much interest in confusing those he
meets as he has in talking to them. But at all times he is involved only
for his own amusement, regardless of the vistims."

So this got me to pondering:

If Kierkegaard, Sartre, Aristole, Marx (or your favorite philosopher/
thinker ) were a Dr. Suess character what would he/she/it be like?

Also existing characters what philosophy nearest matches their
temperament?

e.g. in Green Eggs and Ham,  Sam-I-Am, with  herculian  effort,
convinces his reluctant friend to eat green eggs and ham. "Try it-
you'll like it" type.  Is he a platonist, humanist, what?

   Or the Grinch, whose heart is two sizes too small, hates
Who-ville's Christmas celebration and plans to steal all the
presents to prevent Christmas from coming. To his astonishment,
Christmas comes anyway, and the Grinch discovers the true
importance of Christmas doesn't involve gift giving.

Or does it? Is Christmas a matter of fate?  Or can superhuman
 effort change the possibilities of future christmas'.
The grinch - from Neitchze to Ghandi?

What does the Circus McGurkus say about postmodern society?

   Or the Sneetches teach about racism?


Or The Cat in the Hat say about being and nothingness?

If Dr. Suess wrote a rave story what would it be like?


Enquiring minds want to know.


plur,


spookie

first off sorry to spam so many lists

BUT the message below needs commentary (or so I feel) It's not just
commercialism but capitalism- now before you blow this off as some silly
leftist commentary please read)  all the problems people seem to attribute to
certain parties are generally in the capitalism sucks vain.  bigger parties
more headliners more rooms more people more drugs more hype bigger flyers
more elaborate flyers and finally bigger prices-  this is a capitalist
venture and it only gets bigger because that is the capitalist cycle- bigger
is better and envolves more money and makes more money- now money ain't bad
and the US is in a situation that cannot be reversed without some severe
revolution (which won't happen because people with extreme ideals are labeled
cultists and raided) 

I am neither an apologist for heaven's gate , waco or any other shit but look
at america, look at greed and think about the last time we danced with 30-500
folks and payed a nominal fee or passed a hat-  we play by their rules
weither they are laws or having to pay rent for a space or pa or for a
preformer- it all takes money- sorry for the ramble but replie privitely if
you have questions comments or crticisim- thanks

=================================================================
i cant believe you didn't know this one steve!!!
from the oxygen program:
neveron:
dave longstreth and joe tomino, from EUCLID OHIO, began the neveron concept
approximately 2 years ago.  their own musical backgrounds had been in live
music; joe having been a drummer of various kinds of music, and dave having
been a guitarist in several "indy" bands, but both of them decided to
branch out into more abstract areas, such as those explored by bands such

as seefeel and the orb, which combine live musical aspects with the robotic
technology of computers.
in a more specific sense, neveron is an attempt to create a music which is
described by the duo as "streamlined consciousness," which translates as a
flowing, organic/electronic experience, building dry landscapes of sounds
by combining improvised, human sound-making, and the cold mechanics of
technological tools like drum machines and effects processors.

right in your neighborhood..... shame on you stevie!!!    ;)
===================================================================

unfortunately since i missed the party like i said i didn't know
the line-up at all...i just guessed from live drummers at past
columbus partys...tee hee, i've been so busy i still haven't
been able to check out Jeff/Stuff & Sista Spinsta's sunday night
thingy yet and that's just a few blocks down from my house!...looks
like i'll be missing out again this weekend cuz it's my turn to go
down to columbus since last weekend wuz my graduation here in
cleveland (why couldn't u have had Oxygen this weekend Ed?) and 
then next weekend we'll be visiting my parents in California for
the combination my graduation & my dad's B-Day party...and i thought
life would be less hectic after finishing school...atleast no more
classes means more net time...whoopee! =)

Apologies for a modest cross-post, but I think
there's some important history here....

This past Monday, during a trip to my home town of 
Kleveburg, Ohio,  I had the pleasure of revisiting the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum to check out
an exhibit that opened earlier this month, "I Want to 
Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era 1965-1969."

Here's an edited excerpt of exceptional interest from
the narrative, taken from the exhibit and the companion 
book:

"Barry Miles and John 'Hoppy' Hopkins, two of the leaders
of the London underground, were the prime movers behind
Europe's first underground newspaper, The International 
Times. The paper's launch was celebrated with a party on 
Oct. 15, 1966, at the Roundhouse, an old railroad engine
shed.

"A crowd of 2,500 turned out for an 'all - night rave,'
which was advertised as a 'pop op costume masque drag
ball et al.'  The Soft Machine and Pink Floyd performed,
Paul McCartney arrived dressed as an Arab, and Marianne
Faithfull won a prize for barest costume: a nun's habit that
did not quite cover her bottom.

"In its review of the event, the Sunday Times noted that a 
'pop group called Pink Floyd played throbbing music while
a series of bizarre-colored shapes flashed on a huge screen
behind them.... All apparently very psychedelic.' " 

Yes, yes, yes. 

If you're in the vicinity of Cleveland, check this out.
You won't be disappointed. This exhibit will be on display
thru early next year. 

 PLUR and OM, Keith

>>NEW YORK--As trouser downsizing continues throughout the troubled
>>economy and budget cuts threaten employees' pants security, many workers in
>>legwear-based fields have come to fear the worst.
>>
>>But though trouser downsizing affects virtually all Americans, the hardest
>>hit are those in the country's $2.1 billion domestic raving industry, who
>>depend on trouser size for their very survival. Trouser downsizing for them
>>is no mere media buzzword, but a serious threat to their way of life.
>>
>>      "Without dope-ass phat gear, I will not be able to rave nearly as
>>effectively as I have done in the past," said Minneapolis-area raver Mark
>>the Phonky Alien, whose overall trouser volume has decreased more than 40
>>percent in the last six months due to fabric cutbacks. "I cannot drop crazy,
>>low-end bass, I cannot freak the turntables, and I cannot put food on the
>>table for my family. It's that simple."
>>
>>      All across America, an increasing number of raving-industry workers
>>are afraid of losing their pants, watching helplessly as their trousers
>>continue to decrease in size. Many have been forced to endure cuffs that
>>stop short of the foot, leaving the entire top of the shoe exposed.
>>
>>      In some of the worst-hit areas, such as New York's SoHo and Greenwich
>>Village, massive denim shortages have caused the price of oversized pants to
>>nearly triple. Many of these New York ravers, unable to afford the high
>>prices, have actually been forced to abandon their dope, oversized Fuct and
>>Alien Workshop-brand gear altogether, trading them in for humiliatingly
>>narrow $30 Levi's "slim fits."
>>
>>      "Phat-ass gear is going the way of the dinosaur, and no one in the
>>society at large seems to be doing anything about it," said out-of-work
>>Chicago raver DJ Free MDMA, 20, whose straight-leg jeans barely even sag at
>>the crotch. "Just look at me. I look ridiculous. It hurts to admit it, but
>>I've even started wearing khakis on weekdays, just to make ends meet."
>>
>>      "They're Dockers," he added tearfully. "They're even pleated."
>>
>>      Raving-industry insiders say the situation is only going to get worse.
>>
>>      "Unchecked, unregulated trouser growth throughout the early '90s
>>resulted in a rate of denim use that simply could not sustain itself," said
>>Anson Farber of Princeton's Institute For Trouser Studies. "Trouser mergers
>>throughout the decade, in which as many as three or four pants worth of
>>fabric were combined into a single pair of trousers, created an unstable
>>leg-width situation that
>>continues to this day. A collapse of the nation's drastically overinflated
>>pants was inevitable."
>>
>>      According to Farber, by as early as 1998 we may begin seeing ravers in
>>shorts.
>>
>>      DJ Freek Malik, who spins Friday nights at Miami's famed Club 808, has
>>mounted an effort to fight back. Collecting fabric donations from every
>>available source, Malik's organization, PhatNow!, is attempting to provide
>>trouser relief for Miami-area ravers, adding desperately needed volume to
>>their pants.
>>
>>      But even Malik admits it is an uphill climb. "A lot of ravers use
>>their pants to provide a place to crash for friends who've been kicked out
>>of their parents' houses," he said. "What are they supposed to say? 'I'm
>>sorry, but my pants just aren't big enough for the both of us anymore, I'm
>>kicking you out on the street'?"
>>
>>      "It's sad," Malik added, sighing. "Many of these kids have had no
>>choice but to give up raving altogether and try to find work elsewhere,
>>often as goths."
>>
>>      Yet despite the hardship, many ravers remain optimistic about the
>>future. "I hear there's gonna be a big rave in Phoenix this weekend," said
>>Brianna Dunham, 18, a Tempe, AZ, raver. "This one guy Dean's got a car.
>>We're all going. I can't wait."
>>
>>      Sadly, that's all the nation's ravers can do--wait. And hope that
>>trouser downsizing won't ultimately leave them high and dry.

All I can say is wow, if you missed it you missed out. Anyone who
didn't come down because they thought (I don't want to drive all that
distance for nothing) missed out. Let me quickly say the place was JAMMIN.
The new sound sistem was crystal clear and omigod the LASER!!! Review
comming shortly..

There was some confusion on when exactly this event is,

Maybe this will clear things up!  +)

THANK YOU ALL!!!

FESTIVAL: July 12th & 13th 1997

The idea behind this event is to bring together for one weekend all the
major players in the Texas Rave scene. Call it a RAVE CONVENTION, call it a
TEXAS RAVE WOODSTOCK. This party is not driven by money but is driven by MUSIC.

         Everyone on the Dj lineup and everyone who sets foot on the
campground must pay the $10 camping fee. There is no way around this fee. It
is fortunate we found such a great space for so little money that will
tolerate us for the whole weekend.  I am so looking forward to this event. I
know that everyone will have a GREAT time. Everyone on the crew listing has
supported Dreamscope in one way or another over the last couple of years and
I have taken the liberty to say that these crews are brining you this party.
Which they are, because without their support finacially or otherwise this
party would not be possible.

        I strongly suggest to all crews and promoters FROM TEXAS to be
prepaired for this event. Bring a table and setup a booth. Have a sign up
sheet for people to recive info about your parties, special events or
zine's. Sell T-Shirts, Sell your Dj tapes, do any kind of vending
(non-food/beer related) you want. This is your time to SHINE! (If you vend
you must be set up before 1pm Saturday, please e-mail me for more info) 

        I'm asking everyone to please copy, reprint, make your own flyer
with the party info, distribute or crosspost via any avenue to make this
event the best it can be. Imagine, 3000+ people all at one campground, for
one weekend, with ONLY the best Texas dj's and talent. We have so many good
Dj's and talented people here in TEXAS we deserve an annual event
celebrating our strengths. Please help promote and spread the good vibes.....

woo hoo...

what a night what a night...i thought the first steel city was good but
last night might have been better.


all i can think about was how chris white AKA starchild, funky monkey,
starhonkey was kicking up shit last night!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   i just
want to say that i wish him the best of luck at princeton u next
year...although it was diselboys final gig it was also kind of a fair
well set for starchild.  starchild has done alot at least here at cmu.  
mad props to him.


chip's set was also really good.  i wanted to comment earlier about
playing hip-hip at party's.  i think this is a really really good idea. 
at neon this past weekend they had a hip-hop dj and it was nice hearing
something different plus for the b-boys and b-girls out there it gives
us a chance to break ;)  but really, looking at the crowd it looked like
everyone enjoyed supa-c's set.

As far as this event goes, I've had phone calls from as far away as 
Chicago, Virgina, Ohio, Pittsburgh, Toronto, wanting more info on this 
event.
It's going to be quite big,and it's the 1st electronic dance music 
party (or rave like event) to benefit an Aids organization in NYC.

If this doesn't prove that DJ culture has taken whold in America I don't
know what does.


                   Grammy Awards Announce New Categories
                                      
     May 22 [12:00 EDT] -- The Grammy Awards have broadened their scope,
     adding categories to honor work in dance music and remixing.
     
     On Tuesday, The National Academy Of Recording Arts & Sciences
     (which governs the Grammys) announced it will now also dole out
     awards for Remixer of the Year and Best Dance Recording.
     
     The remixing Grammy will be based on a year long body of work and
     will be awarded to one who, "takes previously recorded material and
     adds to or alters it in such a way as to create a new and unique
     performance."
     
     The Academy's dance addition applies to commercial singles created
     specifically for the dance market.
     
     In announcing the changes, the Academy also noted that the Album of
     the Year category will now allow each artist on a soundtrack or
     various artist album to receive an award. In past years, statuettes
     were only awarded to artists whose work appeared on a majority of
     the album.
     
     For more on The Grammy Awards, go to the MTV News Gallery.

irregardless, we get a weekly post for some bar in DC.  i cant imagine 
too many ppl driving there to a weekly.  whether ppl from here or not 
call, i consider it off topic myself.  we have a party from texas being 
posted, thats at least a 20 hour drive, longer i'm sure.  from my point 
of view there are several solutions.  none of which i'm sure you want to 
hear.  !!!!PLEASE!THINK!BEFORE!YOU!POST!YOUR!OUT!OF!AREA!PARTY!!!!!!

from the ROM:
>Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
>consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
>east as Allentown.  Maybe more, maybe less!

generally i dont put allentown up.  new york is out. kentucky is out.  dc 
is out.  canada is out.  the "Maybe more, maybe less!" rule is very 
seldom used. 
+8 asked about posting here.  i told them as long as it didn't get out of 
hand. and for the most part i hear very little from them, usually posting 
about web broadcasts, which generally are topical.

so, to reiterate:

 !!!!PLEASE!THINK!BEFORE!YOU!POST!YOUR!OUT!OF!AREA!PARTY!!!!!!
 !!!!PLEASE!THINK!BEFORE!YOU!POST!YOUR!OUT!OF!AREA!PARTY!!!!!!
 !!!!PLEASE!THINK!BEFORE!YOU!POST!YOUR!OUT!OF!AREA!PARTY!!!!!!
 !!!!PLEASE!THINK!BEFORE!YOU!POST!YOUR!OUT!OF!AREA!PARTY!!!!!!

thank you for your cooperation and continued support.  trouty.

speakin o remixes, just picked up the imported double disk MOBY
- Everything Is Wrong non-stop dj mix by evil ninja Moby with
remixes by DJ Seduction, Westbam, Josh Wink, and others...all the
tracks were redone into every shade of the techno spectrum: hard
techno, joyous anthems, quiet ambience, new york hard house, groovy
acid, and melodic trance...not only is the compilation pretty
inpirational, but it also brought back some nice memories...flashbacks
of Moby DJ'ing at HARMONY (the first Eternal Peace Tribe party in
Akron, Ohio before Brian broke off to form Underground Peace Society)
and seeing him again performing live in Cleveland at Peabody's with
Mary...

i also have alot of respect for what he says inside the album cover...

===================( begin clip from MOBY Remix CD )=====================

the original version of "Everything Is Wrong" has a long list
of things that are wrong. here's a list of things that you can
do to make things better:

o don't tolerate injustice        o make music/learn an instrument
o don't tolerate cruelty          o write letters
o stop eating animal products     o entertain people
o vote                            o don't buy products tested on animals
o write to your elected reps      o throw away your car
o be honest                       o stay up late
o dance a lot                     o wake up early
o talk to strangers               o be active
o find work that satisfies you    o walk in the woods
o play games                      o protest
o go outside                      o make yourself happy
o stop smoking                    o be in love with God
o eat organically grown food      o have sex with someone you love
o read a lot                      o invite your friends over for dinner
o get inolved with eco-terrorism  o use public transportation
o support amnesty international,  o find out about renewable sources of energy
  PETA & other benefitial groups  o imagine a world without people
o be tolerant of differences      o make bread
o walk                            o sing
o sit on rooftops                 o write messages on walls
o climb on trees                  o draw pictures
o swim                            o go somewhere you've never been
o learn a language                o run
o apologise to the rest of the    o get angry about what we're doing to this
  world (esp. Laos & Cambodia)      planet and its inhabitants
o recycle                         o talk to old people
o buy used clothing               o assume that you're wrong

--- evil ninja moby, notice the black heart...shunning all goodness...
    embracing the night...like a cat with worms...he prowls and stalks
    what could have transformed this once sunny character into such a
    ruthless fiend?...such things are best left unspoken...

=======================( end clip from MOBY Remix CD )========================

just a li'l reminder that there's alot more to life than "mental masturbation"
in front of the computer screen...

No offense I realize Moby is entitled to do whatever he wants, but does
his self righteaous bullshit make anyone else mad?? He always goes off on
the rave scene saying the music has become too conservative, and while he
has proved himself to be a talented musician (all around mind you, not
really techno), he consistantly puts out some of the most dated sounding
bullshit when he tries to do techno. Yet he probably has a larger fan base
than any other act associated with the elctronic music scene in the US. To
me he is part of the problem. And his little tirads about people should do
this and people should do that make me even madder. DO WHATCHA LIKE!

Sorry :)

i am a big fan of moby and open minded attitudes to others opinions
so i find it necessary to reply here.

>No offense I realize Moby is entitled to do whatever he wants, but does
>his self righteaous bullshit make anyone else mad?? 

moby has never proclaimed to be self righteous.  he does not TELL people
what to do, he just suggests what he finds to be a better way of living.
you do not have to pay attention to what he says.  if you learn more 
about him, you will see that he is very open about his hypocritical-ness.
he admits to drinking and doing drugs on rare occasions.  he admits to 
being human.

>He always goes off on
>the rave scene saying the music has become too conservative, and while he
>has proved himself to be a talented musician (all around mind you, not

>bullshit when he tries to do techno. 

the rave scene is too conservative.  fact.  i'll agree that alot of his
newer techno sounds
dated, but one of the reasons i find for the rave scene's suckiness as of late
is because the quest for emotional MUSIC has been replaced with a 
never ending competition to be more CUTTING EDGE.

>Yet he probably has a larger fan base
>than any other act associated with the elctronic music scene in the US. To
>me he is part of the problem. 

what is wrong with having a large fan base?  i really never quite understood 
what was so bad about wanting your voice to be heard by as many people as
possible.  when you go to a rave, do you just want to see like 30 people there,
or would it make you happier to have 100?  i'd assume the 100.  it is the
same thing i think.  and what is this "problem"?  i'd love to see more
electronic
artists drop their freakin' masks, express themselves (not the current
cliches), and
not worry about anything other than THEIR music.

>And his little tirads about people should do
>this and people should do that make me even madder. DO WHATCHA LIKE!

absolutely.  do exactly what you like.  moby agrees with you.  if you don't 
want to hear his suggestions, then don't listen to them.  he's no nazi you know.
if you like his music, then listen to it, but don't open the jacket.

>Sorry :)

me too.  i don't want to cum off like a jerk.  it's just that i really
identify with
moby and his beliefs...i think he is very misunderstood.  

love,
ryu

the hippie thing in colorado is verified, but in boulder its really.. i mean
REALLY hard to maintain a hippie type lifestyle if you dont have a mercedes
benz you got for your 16th birthday from your paid-ass parents...free
advice: DONT RUNAWAY TO COLORADO IF YOU HAVENT GOT A JOB YET...ive seen some
go and come who got two full time regular nonpermanant jobs and still not be
able to pay rent...but yehaaah what a great place to visit:)
thanks for sharing tea i just didnt want anyone to think its some new haven
for bums to flock to...its not.

love
pete

but it has anyway..naturally. look what happened in pittsburgh.. too many
people JUMPED at the thought they could make more money with better
marketing strategies for little kids just like mtv does, not THAT many
people say "im not going to that its gonna be too big" they dont go cause
they dont have the money. you can learn a lot about marketing in the
underground scene. whatch the kiddies fly to see djhype!

i belive youre gonna find commercial type advertisements no matter who you
ban from this list. are you discriminating against corporate office people
vs. ravekids? everyones got something to sell. and if its the music why not
go to mtv? its boosted a lot of musicians careers. your plan sounds like you
want some revenge from mtv or something...

heres an idea.. lets let mtv do promotion for us! that way we get big
parties and they get more techno sales and stuff..that would help spread the
celebration of unity in the _diversity_ ot life, music, and dance.

reminds me of a magazine snippet featuring Coolio's thoughts on Techno:
"I Hate Techno. You have to do drugs to get into it. I can't get into it"

so if techno gets big, labels will have to hire us DrUg FuCkS to tell them
whats cheesy and what isnt... more jobs! more drugs! cant complain!

Fredrich Neitzche(sp?) prolly did considering his first book, "The Birth of

i hate to say this, but i think tea and joe were right when one of em said
if this project wasnt DONE from about six weeks from the inspiration its
prolly not going to happen.
i think there are too many people that talk the talk but cant walk the walk,
but ill also be damned if im accused as one of them, i offered advice and
service and although i now longer have access to Cd production (which WOULD
HAVE BEEN beneficial for tape distrobution) its a shame not to see it
happen...but if there is still hope for this id really like to give tobes a
new tape cuz the stuff on my DAT sucked ass compared to my remixes

assuming that wont happen, keep up the good work everyone who gave stuff to
jimg/skoop:)
thanks everyone for listening to pb-cle-electronica??? (that WAS the
original name btw, i checked the archives, lets not be stuffy and stoopid
(i.e. midland may-phlem)) 

 hehe posting all my messages on a full moon feels so real

if it is true that the house will NEVER die, we must clean it up once in
while, or else the dancefloor becomes sticky and little ants start coming up
through the cracks and before you know it the five-O breaks down your door
asking for credentials.

Didn't mean to give that impression.  Actually, It's way expensive to 
live out there.  A one bedroom little ass apartment is like $400 dollars 
a month.  However, there are still a bunch of hippies living up in the 
mountains, believe me, I met a lot of them.  The Trust-a-farians (what the 
locals call yuppie-trust fund-hipppies) may be all over Boulder city 
limits, driving around in their new PathFinders, but there are plenty of

Huh? Midland Mayhem was the name everyone seemed to agree on. I seem to
remember it being called the pb-cle-something but it certainly wasn't
"electronica". I am sure I am not the only one who cringes when they hear
this new blanket term for the various shades of electronic music. Kinda
like when they started calling everything "alternative". In any event I
think everyone had decided it should have a better name and it became
Midland Mayhem. I don't see anything stuffy or "stoopid" about that name
but I do see something pretty nerdy/stuffy/trendfollowing/bandwagon
jumping, about calling it "PB-CLE-Electronica". And I am sure I'm not the
only one who feels that way.

i'm no expert, but i believe that drum n bass is the more laid back
and jazzy/ambient type stuff...and jungle is the more rave oriented hard stuff.

if i knew man...if i knew...
from what i know about all the hippiehouses at penn state (and there are a
lot more of them than "ravecaves") is that to maintain their lifestyle they
go through alot of illegal money and drugs. not to assume that to be a
farout wanderer requires doing illegal things, but drug money is in their
financial picture..its usually at least "considered heavily" as a way to
make money. . that aside i believe that the haven your looking for could be
a lot closer than you think it is, but thats not something you prolly want
to hear. nevertheless, there is a "scene" here as im sure there is around
many other big type universities..and quite easy to mesh in with it. the
rave culture isnt like that here and is way to irrelevant to explain so i wont. 

it seems like the happy and attractive sort of hippies are always the ones
that are rich to begin with and are used to being spoiled, and choose a the
new lifestyle in either in rebellion or to understand their parents, wanting
to get kicked out of the house so they can travel by volkswagen or hitchike
on a trip to oregon cuz thats where the best shrooms are. this is more of a
the haven youre looking for than colorado is, although its more of a mecca
than a haven. antitechnologists have been going there for decades. ive met
people who follow phish around eventhough they cant even stand the band
because they either wanted to escape or just travel with friends and have
stories to tell. you cant really follow dj's around like that. you cant
really 'jam out' on turntables either, not to say you cant on other
electronic devices :) that's what hippie culture has on us i guess.

too bring up another discussed topic,
im still not convinced DJ culture has really taken over america at all. its
growing tremendously, but there will always be a limit to how minimal people
like things. you can call yourself a dj if you dont own any records these
days, or only buy records from a Dj sort of company that has all those pop
dance hits from england. so in that sense the dance scene is thriving
tremendously, wehich is good, but the majority of people still like to hear
'songs' not 'tracks'. i think its just a gimmick and probably related in
effect to Beck's song "two turntables and a microphone"

so if youre looking for a sort of utopia among your way-to-evolved and
convoluted civilation, go to your closest coffee shop, engage in
conversation with a friendly positivist and start to study the vibes of
different places with people that have liked being there. you might discover
you are at exactly the right place or may find at least that there IS an
inlet in the wall between where are you and where you want to be. a lot of
people here talk about going west (i being a guilty party) without a plan,
as sort of a spontaneous urge. since i have no real plan yet im just keeping
it on the we'll-see-what-happens- tip.

i dont really know if i answered your question, but its quite theraputic to
give free advice even if its not advice at all. and now that i think of it,
id agree that nothing really great does happen in connecticut from what i
know..driving through hartford seemed a lot like driving through pittsburgh.
anways, have a nice day and avoid the noid :)

potAto potato yo:) its just my opinion, 
and i just dont see anything trendy, stuffy, or groupie-ish in the word
"electronica". its fairly descriptive and precise, not cryptic and abstract,
ands thats just how i like titles. i see your point about the "alternative"
parallel, especially since all of us know the next big thing in radio might
be this wonderful new genre called "electronica," but when you have all
these different type of styles and attidudes coming in to the same tape,
dont you think the title should be somewhat descriptive or relevant? why
avoid a useful name just because of the fear of it becoming too overused? it
certainly isnt yet, well at least as much as alternative is. i can see a
nerdy reflection (because i am a nerd at heart, not by appearance), but a
better word for that would be "intelligent."  

your name "midland mayhem" requires an explanation; its not simple, its
vague, and it
reminds me of one of those monster-truck-show-type commercials like its
something that will make us piss our pants. its really not. its a bunch of
people who make music and talk about raves over the internet who decided to
make a tape to give to their friends to give to their friends and so on.
midland mayhem is a good name for a jungle mixtape, but a weak name for
colaboration project as diverse as ours..but if its the name that everyone
decided on (however that can be justified) it could be a lot worse...like
"PITTSBURGH/CLEVELAND DANCE COMPILATION VOLUME ONE" or "ORIGINAL TECHNO-
DIRECT FROM OUR RAVERS BEDROOMS" so who am i to be picky?

whatever is used, this could be just a reminder to those who dig on "mayhem"
that a lot of rave/type music isnt chaotic at all. arbitrarily, house and
techno is quite the opposite, placing order at the forefront so chaos can be
projected from the listener. in the same way jungle places chaos at the
forefront to project order from the listener, and im curious to see how many
people on this tape actually make jungle (excluding joe, we all know youre
the mack-daddy-pittsburgh-supa-junglist-producer:)

yeah. some of them were a little too cryptic.. i forgot to take my

hay, i didn't drive !!  ;)

anyhow, on the distance subject...  i'm centered between cle, akron, and pgh.
my distances:
dayton:        ~4 hr
cols:          ~3 hr
pgh:           ~1 hr
cle:           ~1 hr
akron:         ~50 mins
erie:          ~1.5 hr
state college: 3.5 hr?  if i remember
balt/philly:   6+ hr.
louisville:    ~9 hr
nyc:           ~500 miles
dc:            6 hr if i recall

my rule of thumb is 4 hrs for the rom. i'm about to close the list up if we
keep getting nyc posts about weeky events mailed on a daily basis.  i have
a few other ideas i have to check out first.

trouty.

I've set up a new email account so that I'll continue to get email

A new record store is opening in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. 

HyperVinyl will stock new and used techno, house jungle/drum&bass 12"s,
10"s and CD's. (Maybe even a few dubplates :)

You will soon be able to listen stuff on selected listening stations
through out the store before you purchace. 3-4 listening stations, no
waiting. Friendly and helpful staff. And an Oakland location.
Note: they still are ordering their new stock but there are quite a few
used records being sold at the moment at good prices. Stop by and check it
out. 

HyperVinyl is located at 352 Atwood Street, Oakland, Pittsburgh, PA

Call 412.458.7191 for more information

Well, a trip to this url in Lynx yields:

                                      o O It's an Evil World After All...

   [INLINE]

   If this isn't evil, I don't know what is. Just say no to Disney!

   I mean, seriously, WHY did they make this? It's CREEPY. Crass
   commercialism, I gotta tell ya. If you have any disagreements, hey,
   email me (Kaplane1@tiger.uofs.edu). Neh?

   Head out to Eli's index.

Just wanted to put in my 2 cents on Hyper Vinyl - check it out & support
it! Just starting, but from what I'v heard, they know their stuff about
techno, and not just from reading some article in Details magazine.

The location is the place on Atwood that used to be Aziz.

This has nothing to do with vinyl, BUT...................
I have just recently re-subscribed to the list, and I was expecting to 
see posts from all over Texas. It very nice to see someone has taken up 
the cause for regional techno heads like myself......................

for anybody that cares, Activated will not be coming out for a few months. lack 
of enough advertisements and a decent computer to use for layouts has forced me 
to postpone the new issue until i can remedy these things. we will be back in 
about 2-3 months. we are still planning on launching the website soon though, i 
will make another post when it is up.

if you wish to keep sending us promos we may try to print all the reviews in the 
next issue, space depending. who knows, maybe we will get more ads the next time 
(yeah, likely). 

we are not going away, just getting our shit together for the next wave of 
assault. muahaha! RAGE!!! Techno-terrorism in the nine seven.

ok, i am bad at netmeets. i either lose track of time or don't want to
leave the floor because i am so into whoever is on. but if everyone wants
to meet up at like 2am or something it would be cool. hmm if its at the
Valleydale Ballroom we can meet by the upstairs bar selling water and
beer, if not, by the smart bar. i'll be standing there, in my

For those of you in the mood for something a little out of the ordinary:

REVO will be performing their live experiment BILOCATION
Saturday May 31 at the projekthaus:::6806 Thomas Blvd
The experiment begins promptly at 10:30
Doors open at 9:00 pm.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with REVO they are a group of local 
researchers in the field of re-information. Their sonic experiments are 
conducted with at least two Macintosh laptops running the REVO designed 
software "Back to Basics: a program that allows the realtime playback and 
manipulation of looped samples imported from a sound program such as 
SoundEdit. Ranging from beatheavy, danceable tracks to experiments WAY on 
the edge of ambient/found sounds their shows are always enjoyable evn if 
they aren't predictable. I am presently trying to schedule some local 
experimental electronic and/or ambient djs for before and after the show 
but without confimation I can't promise anything. 

Durections can be heard at the projekthaus info line: 661-MSKW

which will be broadcasting live over the net using Real Audio.  (Or if I
can swing it, selected sections of both rooms) The lineup is as follows:


LEVEL ONE
 10:00-12:00: odyssey
 12:00-1:30: lotus
 1:30-4:00: Stacey Pullen 
 4:00-5:15: Psychick Warriors ov Gaia live
 5:15-8:00: eric downer

LEVEL TWO
 aria :10:00-12:00
 algorhythm :12:00-1:30
 The Black Dog live :1:30-3:30
 Electronic Tabla Fusion live:3:30-4:30
 Transformantra live :4:30-5:20
 asi vs. polyphonic :5:20-8:00

	The Real Audio link will be up as soon as the party starts (or if all goes
well, before hand) and the operator of the link (probably me) will be on
IRC in the channel #lodge on EFNet if anyone has any questions.  If for
some reason that channel becomes unavailable, we'll switch to #thelodge.

	More details about the party (including the link for the Real Audio
broadcast) can be found at http://www.interlog.com/~testsite

	Enjoy the music!
