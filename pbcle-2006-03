Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Would you care to get into a political discussion, or are you satisfied 
with merely insulting people?


Ball's in your court, kid.


  My impression is that this is not a politcal message board.  I'm sure you can find one of those easily.  Then you can stop polluting this message board with your biased party based banter. No gives a flying fuck what you have to say about politics Entropy.  Your views are as refreshing as old douche-water.....kid.

I remember when they used to talk about music on this board.

That reminds me, I am really digging "The Real Dub" -that new song from
Infekto. That Pendulum track, "Hold Your Color" is making me smile lately,
too.

I live my life by God's Word.  Drugs are not mentioned in the Scripture.   
When dealing with adiaphoria (that which is neither commanded nor  
condemned), it is left up to the judgement of the person and whether or  
not it creates a stumbling block for thy neighbor.  Drugs do not.

the fact that you have all this time to debate anybody on all of these 
mailing lists is a little insane.   You would debate until nobody writes 
back.  Don't you get tired of being like this?  Personally I feel sorry for 
you.

I love debating.  I love teaching.  If only one person is helped along in  
finding God because of something I have said somewhere online (and a  
couple have), then I have done good work.

LOL ZOMFGBBQPIE that made my night.  The church of entropy.


...and yes I'm fully expecting you to bash me on the "LOL ZOMFGBBQPIE"
part, you're so predictable.  And of course you'll edit this little
paragraph out when you quote the message.  But will you still do that
now that I said that you would bash me for that (hmm, there's a lot of
'that' in that sentance)? ohh the debate that's happening in your head
right now.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

"We are very sorry to announce that the March 2nd Mental Floss is 
cancelled (please help spread the word). Despite the cancellation, we 
hope to continue this monthly at some point in the future, as we hope to 
find a new place to do it. Mental Floss may be on hold for now, but 
plans are already coming together for an early April blowout in Akron 
for all ya'll "fools" (more on this to come). Many thanks to friends, 
acquaintances, djs, promoters, and everyone who came out to Kent over 
the past 5 months to support Mental Floss and have a good time on a 
weekday night!"

Contestants will be judged by 3 judges on 4 weighted categories giving a 
total possible score of 75 points:

1. Technical and Mixing ability (30%): Don't trainwreck, and if 
something bad does happen... how good is the recovery? Does the set 
flow?

2. Creativity & Originality (30%): This is where judges can add points 
for flare and rate track selection. Are they just playing the hits to 
solicite crowd reaction, or are they actually introducing the audience 
to new music, or finding a creative way to do both.

3. Presentation and Showmanship (20%): This includes all aspects of 
professionalism as well as how stage presence fits with the music being 
played.

4. Crowd Reaction (20%): Bringing friends will help, but Judges will be 
instructed to award points on the reaction of the entire room not on 
screaming friends.

JUDGING CRITERIA

Contestants will be judged by 3 judges on 4 weighted categories giving a 
total possible score of 75 points:

1. Technical and Mixing ability (30%): Don't trainwreck, and if 
something bad does happen... how good is the recovery? Does the set 
flow?

2. Creativity & Originality (30%): This is where judges can add points 
for flare and rate track selection. Are they just playing the hits to 
solicite crowd reaction, or are they actually introducing the audience 
to new music, or finding a creative way to do both.

3. Presentation and Showmanship (20%): This includes all aspects of 
professionalism as well as how stage presence fits with the music being 
played.

4. Crowd Reaction (20%): Bringing friends will help, but Judges will be 
instructed to award points on the reaction of the entire room not on 
screaming friends.

Thu Mar 23                        TEK-KNOW                        Cleveland

In his first ever North American tour Tek-Know is proud to present the
mnml sounds of Sleep Archive.

A Berlin native Stefan Metzger has been the subject of endless rumor
because of his intense underground nature and the influence he has had
on Techno around the world. With releases being played by the most
influential artist in the world including Sven Vaeth, Troy Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos and with a recent appearance on Richie Hawtin's DE9:
Transitions Metzger has been helping to lay the sonic groundwork for the
mnml revolution sweeping Europe while maintaining his underground
status.

The sound of the Sleep Archive is reminiscent of Plastikman's sparsest
moments. But the rhetoric behind his work evokes a moment where faceless
Techno bollox was something to be prized, strived for. When the palette
expands beyond the current clear, black, and blue, the boundaries will
be pushed and we are proud to show you the edge.

Also appearing:
1 Auxy
Andy James (Beretta Music - Detroit, Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Random(seed) (Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Chad Dolis (Resrtukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland)

The View

618 Prospect Ave.

Cleveland, Oh

216.664.1815
Event is !Free! before 12, $5 after

We are proud to bring you a level of Techno that has not been seen in
N.E. Ohio in many years. For once it really is all about the music, and
not a damn thing more.

Friday, May 5

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

April 7th - 9th, 2006

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

Thank god (I mean trout). I've been so close to unsubbing. Pathetic
really considering I'm one of the few that actually wants to talk
about raves on here. Amazing as it is to some of you, to me it's not
Entropy that's the really annoying one, it's the trolls and feeders.
There's no such thing as "debating" religion or politics.

Anyways, to be on-topic, I'm trying to make it to this event, anyone else g=
oing?

There are a couple of Pittsburgh DJs spinning.

Well, I found out about Bounce through this list - an awesome rave in
Pittsburgh last October, a true old-school rave. Wasn't Fresh a real
rave in Cleveland in Jan? Maybe if the list wasn't drowned out by
trolling, you'd have noticed. I tried discussing Bounce on this list
and I don't believe 1 single person replied. When I mentioned that,
many people said all the 'newbies' got chased off... I wonder why.

As far as psuedo-raves, Events like Glow 2 are worth discussing, yeah
they are in a club, so they're nothing like what we went to in the
90s, but this is probably the most appropriate place there is to
discuss them, and the closest thing us 'ravers' have to raves in the
area. There's tons of weekly techno events worth discussing. Heck
discussing DJ and producing tricks helps build the rave scene, so that
seems appropriate, as well as just discussing Electronic music in
general. Not that I'm trying to set the rules on what's appropriate
here, just pointing out that the "there's nothing better to talk
about" argument is baseless.

> Bull. There's ALWAYS going to be some bullshit political view on what
> humans believe in.

Yeah, my point is that there are never political/religious
discussions, just arguments that end with the most stubborn person
"winning"... It's not like anyone is going to switch left->right or
right->left based on an argument here. Anyone who's got enough
convictions to join a political argument isn't going to be swayed...
At least I've never seen it happen. That's why I say it's pointless,.
(and off topic)

It seems like most of it starts as "Lets tick off Entropy and have
some "sport" of him"... Quite pointless as well, might as well take
candy from a baby. You'd think people would get tired of it. It's
actually embarassing to watch.

For me, I strive to keep the negative out of my life. Negativity is
contagious. As much as I like techno and raves, it's not worth it to
have to read through 20 negative emails a day.

I saw this list play a major role in building the rave scene in the
mid 90s. I know many of you subscribe to the view that the scene is
dead and will never be rebuilt. Going to Bounce let me (and alot of
people) know that there ARE ravers out there that want to go to raves.
The one comment I heard over and over at Bounce (including from Trout
himself) was "I had no idea there were this many kandy kids out
there", and "where are all these ravers coming from?". I dont for a
second think the scene can be rebuilt to '99 levels, but I have this
small hope that it could get back to '95 levels, and I believe the
pb-cle list could help if it didn't chase off any potential new blood.

I'm not trying to start another argument here, so this will be my last
post on this subject.

Oh yeah, the guys that did Bounce are throwing another Rave in
downtown Pittsburgh on or about April 29. I hope it's even 1/2 as good
as Bounce was.

Peace,

Dan K

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} politics

Dealing with Entropy is another subject...

Blocking him would get rid of 1/2 of his spam... (Not the replies or trolls=
)

I'm more in favor of petitioning Trout to boot him from the list. I do
consider that mildly unfair because for many of the annoying emails he
sends, an annoying email is sent by someone else to provoke him, but
at this point I'd go for anything to help save the list (in my eyes)
before I boot myself.

To be honest, I think most of the people who are still subscribed here 
are older and really don't attend raves anymore. I think they might 
every once in a blue-moon, but it takes a lot for those types to come 
out anymore. I see more of them coming out to rave like events that are 
posted up in clubs, than anything else. I couldn't comment on Bounce, 
because I was in London at the time. Besides, I very rarely see "raves" 
happening in Cleveland anymore, unless I'm out the loop.

As to the newbies that get chased off. I honestly like seeing new people 
coming around. What I don't like is their endless rants or stupid 
comments on the scene that really make no sense. Those are the ones that 
usually get flamed on.

There used to be strict rules if I'm not mistaken?? A lot of those types 
of discussions you're speaking of happen on the Cleveland nightlife 
forum. I think people feel more comfortable going there to speak about 
those things honestly. Not exactly sure why, but maybe an emailing list 
is getting to old fashion for those guys. *shrugs*

Its just Entropy acting gay. I've seen some pretty cool debates spark on 
here, but that fool just ends it with his endless rants.

The list likes to take the piss of him cause he's been on here for a 
while, and really some of the things he says are ridiculous and have no 
meaning. Personally he rarely has anything to contribute to this list on 
a "rave" factor.. except for he's the worlds number one hardcore Dj...  
raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrr. The kid obviously is signed up to like 
9875934872342354 freaking email lists and still just annoys the shit out 
of everyone. If anything, he should be embarrassed. ;)

Like I said. Couldn't comment on that at all. :)

rave - was entirely a joke. Note the wink. :-D

I don't consider it a joke.  That WAS pretty darn close to a rave,  
especially for the akron area, even complete with a "hardman like"  
sound system.

  MARCH 17TH, 2006
AK Sounds, Euphorix Prophunctionz, & Breakthru Entertainment presnt
THE GOLDEN TICKET
@ The Daily Double
Akron, OH
music from 8pm - ????
   
  featuring performances by:
  Aije Of Atikha- In early '05, the need for a new face in drum n bass was evident; the same ol' 2 record mix-break-rock formula no longer provided the neccesary rush. A new order in the DnB world had to organize... this new order became the Aije of Atikha. With a combined experience of 19 years behind the decks, these 3 DJs and 2 MCs (Atrophe and Infinity) have been making waves of change in the underground revolution. 
   
  Alien Gonzales- Always bringin the mashed up breaks, the G-ride is one of Ohio's hardest selektas of ill DnB with a knack for cuttin it up real sick-like... if you didn't know by now. 
   
  Amotions- We can't put this man into words in simple terms; if you think Rahzel has talent, just wait till this guy grabs the mic! 
   
  Analogue- The term 'eclectic' doesn't justify the diversity that Jon is known is known for... his sets consistently transcend genres and are always a treat. 
   
  Chad Dolis- Restrukture.com founder Chad Dolis has given us much more than a place to share ideas and music; namely more funky hard ass techno than you can shake a stick at. Chad has never been one to disappoint and now that this college professor is making beats, we know that he's going to surprise everyone with his newest tracks. 
   
  Damian Lauderbauch- 
After returning from the west coast where he resided for 18 months, Damian has become AKSounds' premier DJ. If you're a DJ, you watch him and learn new tricks every time; if you're a party goer, you don't stop moving while hes on. 
   
  Dez Drastik- Dez is known for his top-notch selection of floor filling tracks and lays down a mean scratch, not to mention his infamous dubplate that's annihilated many a crowd... solid! 
   
  Glayze- this cat has one of the most diverse record selections in Northeast Ohio, not to mention the flawless mixes that he throws down every time... definitely one of the forerunners in our local scene and deservedly so! 
   
  Grasshoppa- The host of 02 radio is comin to throw down live. 
   
  Influential- This Funky Charms veteran always throws it down proper... don't miss this rare Akron area set showcasing his ultra-funky Florida breaks. 
   
  K Dub- You can catch sometimes catch Euphorix's DnB godfather tagging on the decks with Doktor Nefarious, but tonight he'll be burning the decks with a solo performance; always a dope selection that has left many a crowd wanting more! 
   
  Nate Thomas- This up and coming DJ is holding one of the few monthly residency slots at Annabelles; we've watched his style grow from beat matching to a full repetoire of fader tricks, platter tricks and mixer precision; keep an on this guy! 
   
  Navigator vs. The Director- If you listen to The Raver's Edge you already know what to expect. This duo has 16 years of combined experience behind the decks and it shows; they have played all across the US and Canada and are more than ready to explode in the Midwest. 
   
  Stylez & LB- This high profile duo is burning up the WZIP airwaves with their newest single, "One & Only" & are known for their unprecedented run in 88.1's Sunday local battle. Be sure to witness this performance featuring yet-to-be-released material! 
   
  SWB- This trance master has been the pivital point of trance mastery for 8 years now. His 3 turntable assault and live keybords are enough to send shivers down a ravers spine. 
   
  Thoughtless Entertainment- With 2 releases under their belt and enough live performances to fill a page, this group wants to know if you know hip-hop... and if not, they're gonna show ya! 
   
  Two- TSK's most forefront breaks decknician recently brought the house down at Attack of the Edwards; with a new CD in the works & an ear for the freshest sounds, it's easy to see why "Will Spin For Food" has gradually become a regional classic. 
   
  Y2Kid- Kicking things off with the freshest sounds from the UK and introducing the wobbly, bass driven sounds of dubstep with a bit of grime. This summer marks the release of multiple mixes so get ready! 
   
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
   
  only $10 @ the door, $3 off with flyer
  
There will be CD giveaways throughout the evening...
COME EARLY, MUSIC WILL BE BANGING FROM BEGINNING TO WELL AFTER LAST CALL; HOPE TO SEE YA THERE!!!

Dealing with Entropy is another subject...

Blocking him would get rid of 1/2 of his spam... (Not the replies or trolls)

I'm more in favor of petitioning Trout to boot him from the list. I do
consider that mildly unfair because for many of the annoying emails he
sends, an annoying email is sent by someone else to provoke him, but
at this point I'd go for anything to help save the list (in my eyes)
before I boot myself.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Mar 17                      GOLDEN TICKET                         Akron

MARCH 17TH, 2006
AK Sounds, Euphorix Prophunctionz, & Breakthru Entertainment presnt
THE GOLDEN TICKET
@ The Daily Double
Akron, OH
music from 8pm - ????
 
featuring performances by:
Aije Of Atikha- In early '05, the need for a new face in drum n bass was 
evident; the same ol' 2 record mix-break-rock formula no longer provided 
the neccesary rush. A new order in the DnB world had to organize... this 
new order became the Aije of Atikha. With a combined experience of 19 
years behind the decks, these 3 DJs and 2 MCs (Atrophe and Infinity) 
have been making waves of change in the underground revolution.
 
Alien Gonzales- Always bringin the mashed up breaks, the G-ride is one 
of Ohio's hardest selektas of ill DnB with a knack for cuttin it up real 
sick-like... if you didn't know by now.
 
Amotions- We can't put this man into words in simple terms; if you think 
Rahzel has talent, just wait till this guy grabs the mic!
 
Analogue- The term 'eclectic' doesn't justify the diversity that Jon is 
known is known for... his sets consistently transcend genres and are 
always a treat.
 
Chad Dolis- Restrukture.com founder Chad Dolis has given us much more 
than a place to share ideas and music; namely more funky hard ass techno 
than you can shake a stick at. Chad has never been one to disappoint and 
now that this college professor is making beats, we know that he's going 
to surprise everyone with his newest tracks.
 
Damian Lauderbauch-
After returning from the west coast where he resided for 18 months, 
Damian has become AKSounds' premier DJ. If you're a DJ, you watch him 
and learn new tricks every time; if you're a party goer, you don't stop 
moving while hes on.
 
Dez Drastik- Dez is known for his top-notch selection of floor filling 
tracks and lays down a mean scratch, not to mention his infamous 
dubplate that's annihilated many a crowd... solid!
 
Glayze- this cat has one of the most diverse record selections in 
Northeast Ohio, not to mention the flawless mixes that he throws down 
every time... definitely one of the forerunners in our local scene and 
deservedly so!
 
Grasshoppa- The host of 02 radio is comin to throw down live.
 
Influential- This Funky Charms veteran always throws it down proper... 
don't miss this rare Akron area set showcasing his ultra-funky Florida 
breaks.
 
K Dub- You can catch sometimes catch Euphorix's DnB godfather tagging on 
the decks with Doktor Nefarious, but tonight he'll be burning the decks 
with a solo performance; always a dope selection that has left many a 
crowd wanting more!
 
Nate Thomas- This up and coming DJ is holding one of the few monthly 
residency slots at Annabelles; we've watched his style grow from beat 
matching to a full repetoire of fader tricks, platter tricks and mixer 
precision; keep an on this guy!
 
Navigator vs. The Director- If you listen to The Raver's Edge you 
already know what to expect. This duo has 16 years of combined 
experience behind the decks and it shows; they have played all across 
the US and Canada and are more than ready to explode in the Midwest.
 
Stylez & LB- This high profile duo is burning up the WZIP airwaves with 
their newest single, "One & Only" & are known for their unprecedented 
run in 88.1's Sunday local battle. Be sure to witness this performance 
featuring yet-to-be-released material!
 
SWB- This trance master has been the pivital point of trance mastery for 
8 years now. His 3 turntable assault and live keybords are enough to 
send shivers down a ravers spine.
 
Thoughtless Entertainment- With 2 releases under their belt and enough 
live performances to fill a page, this group wants to know if you know 
hip-hop... and if not, they're gonna show ya!
 
Two- TSK's most forefront breaks decknician recently brought the house 
down at Attack of the Edwards; with a new CD in the works & an ear for 
the freshest sounds, it's easy to see why "Will Spin For Food" has 
gradually become a regional classic.
 
Y2Kid- Kicking things off with the freshest sounds from the UK and 
introducing the wobbly, bass driven sounds of dubstep with a bit of 
grime. This summer marks the release of multiple mixes so get ready!
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
only $10 @ the door, $3 off with flyer

There will be CD giveaways throughout the evening...
COME EARLY, MUSIC WILL BE BANGING FROM BEGINNING TO WELL AFTER LAST

Thu Mar 23                        TEK-KNOW                        Cleveland

In his first ever North American tour Tek-Know is proud to present the
mnml sounds of Sleep Archive.

A Berlin native Stefan Metzger has been the subject of endless rumor
because of his intense underground nature and the influence he has had
on Techno around the world. With releases being played by the most
influential artist in the world including Sven Vaeth, Troy Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos and with a recent appearance on Richie Hawtin's DE9:
Transitions Metzger has been helping to lay the sonic groundwork for the
mnml revolution sweeping Europe while maintaining his underground
status.

The sound of the Sleep Archive is reminiscent of Plastikman's sparsest
moments. But the rhetoric behind his work evokes a moment where faceless
Techno bollox was something to be prized, strived for. When the palette
expands beyond the current clear, black, and blue, the boundaries will
be pushed and we are proud to show you the edge.

Also appearing:
1 Auxy
Andy James (Beretta Music - Detroit, Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Random(seed) (Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Chad Dolis (Resrtukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland)

The View

618 Prospect Ave.

Cleveland, Oh

216.664.1815
Event is !Free! before 12, $5 after

We are proud to bring you a level of Techno that has not been seen in
N.E. Ohio in many years. For once it really is all about the music, and
not a damn thing more.

Fri May 05                         A-TRAK                         Cleveland

Friday, May 5

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

April 7th - 9th, 2006

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

THOSE IN DETROIT THAT CARE ABOUT THE ELECTRONIC MUSIC FEST!!

Originally posted by Paxhahau: 3/10/2006

Greetings Detroit Electronic Music fans and supporters,

As most of you may already be aware, Paxahau has been in discussions to
produce this years electronic music festival in Hart Plaza on Memorial
Day weekend. Everyone is very aware of the time constraints that once
again envelop the production of this event. It is our sincere desire and
mission to provide Detroit, its supporters and cultural enthusiasts with a
festival that represents ALL aspects and genres of electronic music from
around the globe and here at home.

Because of this we are extending an open ear from all of us this evening
at Oslo between 11 pm and 1 am to provide anyone who comes with an
opportunity to present opinions and input regarding format and to discuss
any involvement they may be able to offer. Our goal is to provide the
electronic music community and all who visit Detroit with a festival that
is as diverse as the music culture that brings us all together in clubs
all over the world, every weekend. We realize this is short notice but we
have a very limited amount of time before our final presentation to the
City and sponsors and we want to be able to represent the contributing
members of Detroits electronic music community.

Please understand that for this specific weekend Paxahau is not in the
business of promoting or producing ONE type of music - this festival
belongs to ALL of electronic music and its supporters. Because of this we
are enthusiastically encouraging all of YOU to come and speak with us
tonight to discuss the representation you would like to see, or can bring
to the table. Please be prepared to give us a who you are / what you can
represent / how we can reach you breakdown.


Help us make this festival what it was always meant to be.

Sincere Regards,

Paxahau

I talked to one of the guys throwing this, and if it goes off well,
theres another 3 "Kool Aid" parties planned for this year in
Pittsburgh. Venue sounds awesome, top level of some building downtown,
with a huge ass balcony, capacity around 700.

HEATHER HEART - Techno/Hardhouse EMG-NY

Why do people always book her to play this junk.  Here strong suit is

seeing her spin".

*SHAME ON THE NIGHT*

TOGA * DANCE * PARTY * BRILLO BOX

On this Ides of March...
We seek the fairest of maidens...
and the handsomest of boys...
For lewd dancing on the grave of Caeser...
To joyous musics of our honored jockeys:

...Kellius Lactis
...Cutupicus
...Marie Maximus
...Augustus Umus

Don a Toga for free entrance...
(Else pay 3 denarii.)

Toga fashion and dance contest
will award a Golden Apple!

Your gracious hosts for the evening:

...Thommulus Rex
...Rufus Rex
...Corelius Fuckulus

Bring your daggers as the cock crows Ten.

BRILLO BOX Pittsburgh



Marcus Licinius Crassus: Do you eat oysters?
Antoninus: When I have them, master.
Marcus Licinius Crassus: Do you eat snails?
Antoninus: No, master.
Marcus Licinius Crassus: Do you consider the eating of oysters to be  
moral and the eating of snails to be immoral?
Antoninus: No, master.
Marcus Licinius Crassus: Of course not. It is all a matter of taste,  
isn't it?
Antoninus: Yes, master.
Marcus Licinius Crassus: And taste is not the same as appetite, and  
therefore not a question of morals.
Antoninus: It could be argued so, master.
Marcus Licinius Crassus: My robe, Antoninus. My taste includes both  
snails and oysters.

Having a political debate with you is like nailing Jell-O to the wall.
Pointless and, ultimately, you're none the smarter for having done so.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Mar 17                      GOLDEN TICKET                         Akron

MARCH 17TH, 2006
AK Sounds, Euphorix Prophunctionz, & Breakthru Entertainment presnt
THE GOLDEN TICKET
@ The Daily Double
Akron, OH
music from 8pm - ????
 
featuring performances by:
Aije Of Atikha- In early '05, the need for a new face in drum n bass was 
evident; the same ol' 2 record mix-break-rock formula no longer provided 
the neccesary rush. A new order in the DnB world had to organize... this 
new order became the Aije of Atikha. With a combined experience of 19 
years behind the decks, these 3 DJs and 2 MCs (Atrophe and Infinity) 
have been making waves of change in the underground revolution.
 
Alien Gonzales- Always bringin the mashed up breaks, the G-ride is one 
of Ohio's hardest selektas of ill DnB with a knack for cuttin it up real 
sick-like... if you didn't know by now.
 
Amotions- We can't put this man into words in simple terms; if you think 
Rahzel has talent, just wait till this guy grabs the mic!
 
Analogue- The term 'eclectic' doesn't justify the diversity that Jon is 
known is known for... his sets consistently transcend genres and are 
always a treat.
 
Chad Dolis- Restrukture.com founder Chad Dolis has given us much more 
than a place to share ideas and music; namely more funky hard ass techno 
than you can shake a stick at. Chad has never been one to disappoint and 
now that this college professor is making beats, we know that he's going 
to surprise everyone with his newest tracks.
 
Damian Lauderbauch-
After returning from the west coast where he resided for 18 months, 
Damian has become AKSounds' premier DJ. If you're a DJ, you watch him 
and learn new tricks every time; if you're a party goer, you don't stop 
moving while hes on.
 
Dez Drastik- Dez is known for his top-notch selection of floor filling 
tracks and lays down a mean scratch, not to mention his infamous 
dubplate that's annihilated many a crowd... solid!
 
Glayze- this cat has one of the most diverse record selections in 
Northeast Ohio, not to mention the flawless mixes that he throws down 
every time... definitely one of the forerunners in our local scene and 
deservedly so!
 
Grasshoppa- The host of 02 radio is comin to throw down live.
 
Influential- This Funky Charms veteran always throws it down proper... 
don't miss this rare Akron area set showcasing his ultra-funky Florida 
breaks.
 
K Dub- You can catch sometimes catch Euphorix's DnB godfather tagging on 
the decks with Doktor Nefarious, but tonight he'll be burning the decks 
with a solo performance; always a dope selection that has left many a 
crowd wanting more!
 
Nate Thomas- This up and coming DJ is holding one of the few monthly 
residency slots at Annabelles; we've watched his style grow from beat 
matching to a full repetoire of fader tricks, platter tricks and mixer 
precision; keep an on this guy!
 
Navigator vs. The Director- If you listen to The Raver's Edge you 
already know what to expect. This duo has 16 years of combined 
experience behind the decks and it shows; they have played all across 
the US and Canada and are more than ready to explode in the Midwest.
 
Stylez & LB- This high profile duo is burning up the WZIP airwaves with 
their newest single, "One & Only" & are known for their unprecedented 
run in 88.1's Sunday local battle. Be sure to witness this performance 
featuring yet-to-be-released material!
 
SWB- This trance master has been the pivital point of trance mastery for 
8 years now. His 3 turntable assault and live keybords are enough to 
send shivers down a ravers spine.
 
Thoughtless Entertainment- With 2 releases under their belt and enough 
live performances to fill a page, this group wants to know if you know 
hip-hop... and if not, they're gonna show ya!
 
Two- TSK's most forefront breaks decknician recently brought the house 
down at Attack of the Edwards; with a new CD in the works & an ear for 
the freshest sounds, it's easy to see why "Will Spin For Food" has 
gradually become a regional classic.
 
Y2Kid- Kicking things off with the freshest sounds from the UK and 
introducing the wobbly, bass driven sounds of dubstep with a bit of 
grime. This summer marks the release of multiple mixes so get ready!
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
only $10 @ the door, $3 off with flyer

There will be CD giveaways throughout the evening...
COME EARLY, MUSIC WILL BE BANGING FROM BEGINNING TO WELL AFTER LAST 
CALL; HOPE TO SEE YA THERE!!!

Thu Mar 23                        TEK-KNOW                        Cleveland

In his first ever North American tour Tek-Know is proud to present the
mnml sounds of Sleep Archive.

A Berlin native Stefan Metzger has been the subject of endless rumor
because of his intense underground nature and the influence he has had
on Techno around the world. With releases being played by the most
influential artist in the world including Sven Vaeth, Troy Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos and with a recent appearance on Richie Hawtin's DE9:
Transitions Metzger has been helping to lay the sonic groundwork for the
mnml revolution sweeping Europe while maintaining his underground
status.

The sound of the Sleep Archive is reminiscent of Plastikman's sparsest
moments. But the rhetoric behind his work evokes a moment where faceless
Techno bollox was something to be prized, strived for. When the palette
expands beyond the current clear, black, and blue, the boundaries will
be pushed and we are proud to show you the edge.

Also appearing:
1 Auxy
Andy James (Beretta Music - Detroit, Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Random(seed) (Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Chad Dolis (Resrtukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland)

The View

618 Prospect Ave.

Cleveland, Oh

216.664.1815
Event is !Free! before 12, $5 after

We are proud to bring you a level of Techno that has not been seen in
N.E. Ohio in many years. For once it really is all about the music, and
not a damn thing more.

Friday, May 5

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).



John B

John B
Beta Recordings, MMI
UK

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more

Spree & ADB
http://www.spreeandadb.com/
DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

great Drum Bass DJs, Diesel Boy, Dara, hype, etc... All the great 
turntablists, Q-bert, Immortal, Swamp, etc. members won battles all over

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

April 7th - 9th, 2006

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

Having a political debate with you is like nailing Jell-O to the wall.
Pointless and, ultimately, you're none the smarter for having done so.

Your views are as refreshing as old douche-water

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight@Havana - TERRY KICKS

THURSDAYS@HAVANA
TONIGHT 03.16.06

[BROTHER MIKE] - 10pm & 1am - The man has been holdng it down for quite some 
time now.  Give him a pat on the back and buy the brother a beer.  Or better 
yet, give him a smoke before he tries to bum one off of you.

[TERRY KICKS] - 11pm to 1am - Back before most of us even knew what two 
turntables could do this guy was rocking joints from Pittsburgh to NYC.  
(don't even get him started with his stories about hanging out at The Loft 
and Paradise Garage back in the day) Terry has a record collection that 
exceeds 75,000 records.  No joke.  Come hear this veteran lay down some 
classic garage style  house and disco.

NO COVER / 21+ / I.D. Required
$2 Yuenglings & $3 Mojitos (soon to be changed to $3 Jack and Cokes)

Next Thursday's Guest: [BOB TEAGARDEN]

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3D-7426343190324622223

It's a documentary made in 1972 detailing the original plans and thoughts
when designing the precursor to the internet (ARPANet or something like
that)... thought maybe some of the geeks out there might like to see this,
it's 30 minutes long tho, so get cozy.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} NRR The Early Internet

ahh I love old techie vids and their "blazing speeds" of the time:
"high bandwidth leased lines, we're talking 50kbit/sec"

Someone should sample the theme music to it :)

Yeah when I first really learned how the 'behind the scenes' networking
aspect worked, I was amazed at just how thorough they were to design a
system that's pretty much unchanged for 25 years (IPv4, the current
version of the internets, came out in 1981 I believe).  And go back to
81 and tell these engineers that there are going to be homes with
several computers, all being much faster than mainframes that take up
rooms, and being able to download at 5 mbit/sec.  And be able to view
streaming video, play games that have reach the point of being too
realistic, and having so many computers that we're litterally running
out of availiable internet addresses we can give to people (yes, the
internet is getting full).

ok enough geekiness for one email...

My wife was asking me if there are any rave documentaries. Anyone know
of any? I'd need the name of it or something to search for.

well..there was a bunch of pretty raw video footage from the party - it
was compiled onto a tape - one of which i have (somewhere).  no interviews
or ppl talking really.  but definitely proof that alan had that damned
generator parked outside his house the week before the party - pretty
suspicious if you aks me ; )

when i find it you all can come over for a viewing.

Well, doing a search for "rave" on the eMule p2p network revealed a
rather extensive series called "rave gloryhole"... It's set in the
bathroom, but I guess I don't need to go into that one further :p

Actually it seems kinda impossible to find any of these
recommendations on p2p. I found the "Scratch" one, but it seems more
like a documentary of Hip Hop DJs. I'm getting "better living through
circuitry" too. that's about it.

concept...this celebrates the first official track released by 6 YEAR
OLD FEMALE ARTIST KAYLOW, recorded during a live studio performance
which left her gear in pieces and randomly scattered throughout the
room alongside piles of stuffed animals, barbie dolls, and godzilla
toys. Artwork by Brian Grainger. Mastered and sequenced by Brian
Grainger.

Having a political debate with you is like nailing Jell-O to the wall.
Pointless and, ultimately, you're none the smarter for having done so.

Your views are as refreshing as old douche-water

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Thu Mar 23                        TEK-KNOW                        Cleveland

In his first ever North American tour Tek-Know is proud to present the
mnml sounds of Sleep Archive.

A Berlin native Stefan Metzger has been the subject of endless rumor
because of his intense underground nature and the influence he has had
on Techno around the world. With releases being played by the most
influential artist in the world including Sven Vaeth, Troy Pierce,
Ricardo Villalobos and with a recent appearance on Richie Hawtin's DE9:
Transitions Metzger has been helping to lay the sonic groundwork for the
mnml revolution sweeping Europe while maintaining his underground
status.

The sound of the Sleep Archive is reminiscent of Plastikman's sparsest
moments. But the rhetoric behind his work evokes a moment where faceless
Techno bollox was something to be prized, strived for. When the palette
expands beyond the current clear, black, and blue, the boundaries will
be pushed and we are proud to show you the edge.

Also appearing:
1 Auxy
Andy James (Beretta Music - Detroit, Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Random(seed) (Tek-Know - Cleveland)
Chad Dolis (Resrtukture - Akron, Tek-Know - Cleveland)

The View

618 Prospect Ave.

Cleveland, Oh

216.664.1815
Event is !Free! before 12, $5 after

We are proud to bring you a level of Techno that has not been seen in
N.E. Ohio in many years. For once it really is all about the music, and
not a damn thing more.

Fri May 05                         A-TRAK                         Cleveland

Friday, May 5

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.
Proudly Presenting:

UnderGround Sound

James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB

DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

April 7th - 9th, 2006

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

CITY OF DETROIT AND PAXAHAU SHAKE HANDS,
ELECTRONIC MUSIC FESTIVAL WILL GO ON.

DETROIT- Paxahau Promotions Group today announced they have been chosen by
the City of Detroit to be the producers of this years Electronic Music
Festival on Memorial Day Weekend, May 27-29.

We are sincerely honored that the City has selected someone within the
electronic community to produce this event - we have worked extremely hard
to establish ourselves as a globally respected organization, specifically
to bring this event the cultural attention it deserves, said Jason
Huvaere, owner of Paxahau.

Paxahau presented a sound plan to stabilize and grow the event, said
Lucius A. Vassar, the City of Detroits Chief Administrative Officer. We
want to see this event flourish and continue to draw people from all over
the world to Detroit.

Since 1998 Paxahau has produced Electronic events in Detroit. In that time
they have grown to include a record label, booking agency, web-archive and
event production company which hosts an average of 20 events a year in the
city.

The festival producers have also been endorsed by previous festival
directors, Carl Craig, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson.

As the festivals 2003 and 2004 producers, we are pleased to see that
Paxahau will be taking on the event, said electronic music pioneer
Derrick May. Jason Huvaere and his group are not only competent event
managers, but they are of the electronic music industry. I am confident
that in their hands, the events integrity as the worlds signature
electronic music festival will be preserved, and its operations and
management strengthened. 

In an effort to maintain a globally recognized, positive brand image for
Detroit, Paxahau will retain the name Movement, Detroits Electronic
Music Festival.

With a network of alliances and resources that span the globe, the Paxahau
team has emerged as a premier promotions group within the electronic music
industry. They plan on growing the festival into a cultural attraction
that celebrates not only to sonic art forms associated with Electronic
Music, but also the visual arts culture that has evolved from its
influences as well.

We see the festival as an opportunity to bring Detroits influence all
over the world home and nourish one of Detroits primary opportunities for
tourism and development, said Huvaere.

Specific details regarding the festival will be released at a later date.
Please visit www.demf.com to find the latest news as it develops.

For now Detroit and the world needs to start getting ready for a 3-day
party at the end of May. Detroits electronic music festival will go on.

It was a'ight.  good number of people for a thursday
night...maybe 75-80 or at it's busiest.  

Personally, I though 1auxy stole the night. 
reeeeeeally good minimal set.  Andy's stuff was good
too.  I caught about a half hour of sleeparchive
(evidently i left right before sound issues?) which
was interesting but nothing mindblowing enough to make
me forget that my bed was calling.

        Electronic music festival is a go, but location still undecided


BY BRIAN McCOLLUM

Detroits annual techno festival is a go for Memorial Day weekend, 
producers and city officials announced Thursday, but one big question 
looms: Where will it happen?

The City of Detroit has handed control of the 2006 fest to Paxahau 
Promotions Group, a Ferndale events firm that has a long history with 
the areas electronic music party scene.

The event will be dubbed Movement, Detroits Electronic Music 
Festival, incorporating names used by two previous editions of the 
fest, which has drawn thousands of fans annually and been heralded as a 
Detroit cultural jewel.

Thursdays late-afternoon announcement confirmed what had been 
informally known among local techno aficionados for several weeks  that 
Paxahau chief Jason Huvaere had been working closely with Detroit 
officials to get operations up and running for an event battered by past 
financial problems.

Kevin Saunderson, the Detroit techno veteran who produced last years 
Fuse-In event, announced in February that he would not be part of a 2006 
fest.

Lucius Vassar, the citys chief administrative officer, said in a 
statement Thursday: For more than 10 years, Paxahau has maintained a 
stellar track record and has begun to establish an international 
presence in the electronic music industry. We are confident that they 
will produce a successful event this year.

Saundersons festival was the first in Hart Plaza history granted 
permission by the city to charge an admission fee. This Mays Movement 
will also be a ticketed event, Huvaere said, a move that will require 
approval by the Detroit City Council.

A meeting with council members has not yet been set, he said, but final 
festival information  including ticket fees and artist lineups  is 
expected to be in place by the end of April.

Still to be decided is Movements location. Hart Plaza, home to the six 
previous fests, is just one of three city-owned properties being 
considered, according to Huvaere and city officials. They declined to 
name the others.

Several Detroit sites could meet the criteria set by Paxahau and the 
city  such as a capacity of at least 40,000. Potential venues might 
include, for instance, Campus Martius, the grounds of Chene Park, Cobo 
Exposition Center and Belle Isle.

Hart Plaza is my third choice, Huvaere said. If Id wanted to just do 
it at Hart Plaza, we could have sealed all of this up weeks ago.

I dont know if anyone has seen this, but some psycho murdered six people at an after party to a zombie themed "rave" in the capitol hill district of seattle.
  Here is a news site that has a gut wrenching first hand look at the events of this terrible morning.
  http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=31345
   Just thought I'd pass this on from nwtekno in case anybody missed it.

A memorial fund has been set up for the victims families.  Any Bank of
America branch will accept donations to the "REmember Relief Fund" or
there's a paypal link at http://djsteele.net/

I still don't really see how msnbc says this was "rave related"... It 
obviously happened afterwards.

Love the media.

Plus the fact that Kyle Huff, the gunman, was not a member of the seattle "rave" community, noone had ever seen him before and he obviously had serious mental problems.

OK, now this version looks a whole lot better than the first one they
made.  That would be sweet you just have a bunch of dj's and when one's
over they just pop out their ipod, next dj pops his in and away he goes.
 First one just seemed more of a proof of concept where this one looks
like it might actually be useful.

"Numark said iDJ2 owners can also use USB devices such as hard drives 
for music playback via rear panel USB ports. Other features include an 
LCD screen that offers waveform display and visual track-profiling, line 
inputs for any audio source, and the ability to record musical 
performances to a docked iPod or any connected USB drive. The iDJ2 
supports MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and AAC (non-DRM) formats. Numark said the 
iDJ2 will be released in August, but has not yet announced pricing."

Oh, and I would ASSUME the pitch control would control those usb devices  
as well?


I wonder.

http://www.djdeals.com/numarkIDJ2.htm

It shows accepting orders for the IDJ2 for $279 with free shipping.
That place doesn't seem to to be the cheapest either. $279 seems REAL
cheap considering the capabilities and competing product prices.

I'm actually kinda excited about this product... I'll just buy a cheap
IDE->USB hard drive box and use an old outdated HD to store the music
on... Either that or burn DVDs full of mp3s and use my existing USB
DVD player... I wonder if the system buffers well enough to do that
though.

I'd guess that it's USB interface is host only, it would be REAL sweet
to have it so that it could be used as a controller for software on
the PC, but I don't see any mention of that in the specs.

I'm saving my pennies starting now.

Gotta love the disclaimer on djdeals.com

PLEASE NOTE: WE DO NOT RECOMMEND NUMARK PRODUCTS. DEFECTS IN NUMARK
PRODUCTS ARE NOT JUST COMMON, THEY ARE HIGHLY LIKELY. SAVE YOURSELF
THE HASSLE OF A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT & CONSIDER A MORE REPUTABLE
MANUFACTURER SUCH AS PIONEER, STANTON, DENON, VESTAX, RANE OR VOCOPRO.

Not to mention they're dirt cheap and dont generate near as much
profit as Pioneer.

heres a mixer that spits out midi info and whatnot.  looks to interface 
with ableton live and traktor right out of the box.

http://www.eclerdjdivision.com/instruments/nuo/nuo4index.htm

quite pricey at 7-800$, but eclers are some of the best mixers i've ever 
used.

Yeah, I would think that in order to control the pitch and skip around on  
any flash drive mp3 player, the mixer itself would need a hard drive or a  
flash drive with a sort of "insta-cache".

What will probably happen is that a mixer like this will come out that has  
a hard drive or flassh drive IN IT, and one loads it up with mp3s before a  
gig...basically an all-in-one.  Show up, plug it in, off ya go.  Now  
THERE'S an idea.

Yeah, that's cool, I just wonder if it can do the same from a usb device  
(ie: NOT an iPod).  I'll keep up on the comments on those two pages and  
see what people say.

If it does load stuff into a sort of RAM, that's awesome.  That would  
almost be an "open-source" mixer.  ;)

It says straight up it will work from USB, anything it can do with the ipod
It should be able to do with USB, they're both serial data streams, and it
looks like it's accessing the ipod just like it was a USB flash disk or som=
e
such. Seems like the USB device would just have to stream fast enough.

As far as a IDJ2 type thing with a HD built in, Numark has a couple of
models on their website... The HDMIX looks like a pro IDJ2 without the ipod
dock and with the 80gig. Who knows how much that one will cost.

It seems like they are going all out with the digital thing... If they're
really selling these IDJ2 for $275, it seems like they may even be selling
them near cost to become a market segment leader or some such. looking at
the closeup the display looks pretty good for this price point:

Yeah imagine if they had a midi clock on it.  It'd essentially be a

if they play their cards right...

Yeah that's what I was thinking as well, something as simple as an external
usb or midi connection to read the control positions would double the
usability of this thing for a few bucks more in parts. Anyhow it seems
pretty pimping right now.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri May 05                         A-TRAK                         Cleveland

Friday, May 5

A-Trak (Kanye West's Tour DJ, among other things)

In the turntablist scene, A-Trak established himself as "the DJ's DJ", 
building groundbreaking routines that managed to push the envelope 
technically while remaining appealing to the untrained ear. He developed 
a revolutionary notation system, which allowed him to write scores of 
scratch patterns and solos. And his DJ battle records quickly became 
cult favorites, used and abused in DJ competitions around the globe.

Earlier this summer, while performing at a London record store, A-Trak 
caught the ear of everybody's favorite rapper/producer, Kanye West, who 
quickly made him his DJ and brought him out on tour, where they 
performed in front of sold-out 20,000 seat stadiums for two months.

He is now getting ready to release his first major solo project, a DVD 
and soundtrack entitled Sunglasses Is a Must.

Jun 30-Jul 2                  UNDERGROUND SOUND             Murphysboro, IL

Throughout the ages mankind has moved and adapted to the changing world 
all the while changing the world around them. Learning how to tune into 
the universe man has managed to make conscious leaps in evolution. These 
leaps have left us with abilities setting us apart from other life on 
this planet. These traits include spoken language, advance visual 
recognition, and that which we take most for granted, a sense of rhythm. 
Throughout history the first to make advances are often cast out by 
society and referred to as freaks only to be respected and admired by 
later generations. As technology and the ability to obtain information 
increases at an ever quickening pace, we must prepare ourselves to once 
again make an evolutionary jump. One year ago we gathered to bring 
ourselves in line with the cosmic rhythms and sent a message out into 
the universe that we are ready to advance. Now we come together to 
receive the response.
CatalyticSouls and Disco Productions invite you to join in on this 
journey to enlightenment.

ELECTRIC SKYCHURCH
http://www.skychurch.com
James Lumb created Electric Skychurch as a vehicle for his imaginative, 
groundbreaking music in 1991. In '93 Skychurch rose up in the LA scene. 
James was throwing parties at his home in Silverlake, a LA neighborhood 
teeming with musicians, filmmakers and artists. The late-night events 
took off, eventually moving from LA to the Mojave Desert, where the 
parties grew into large monthly gatherings. Within a year, the 
gatherings exploded to include thousands of people and seeded the 
notorious .Desert Massive. movement that swept through the American 
West. During this period Lumb penned "Deus", a song that would come to 
be recognized as the earliest incarnation of the "West Coast" trance 
sound. Burgeoning Moonshine Music signed Skychurch in 1994 and released 
"Deus" and another single, "Creation", followed in 1995 by Skychurch's 
first full-length ensemble LP, "knowoneness."

During the .knowoneness. sessions, James met Roxanne Morganstern. They 
were friends for a year before she finally auditioned for a spot in the 
band. Impressed with her unique and powerful talent, James immediately 
brought her into the project and, even though it shocked his band mates, 
shared the spotlight with her the very next week in front of 5,000 fans. 
The vocal chemistry worked. Fans loved it. They created a magical live 
show, which instantly catapulted them even further into the spotlight.

After playing hundreds of concerts and festivals that drew crowds in 
excess of 80,000, Electric Skychurch built a solid grassroots following. 
During the long tour, James and Roxanne were filmed by director John 
Reese for interviews that became part of the feature documentary "Better 
Living Through Circuitry," giving the world a refreshingly honest 
portrait of the producer and his band mates. The film remains popular 
and continues to run on the major cable networks worldwide, and has 
drawn mainstream fans of all ages to the band.



Infected Mushroom
http://infected.co.il/
Infected Mushroom is an Israeli psychedelic trance duo which has 
attained significant popularity from the late 1990s to the present time. 
Formed by Erez Aizen and Amit Duvdevani (also known as Duvdev) in the 
city of Haifa, located in the northern parts of Israel, the duo has 
garnered a large international fanbase. Infected Mushroom are known for 
their consistent sonic evolution exemplified by the subsequent albums 
The Gathering (1999), Classical Mushroom (2000), BP Empire (2001), 
Converting Vegetarians (2003) and the recently released IM The 
Supervisor (2004).

If you haven.t come across John B in one of his many musical guises over
the past decade, where have you been? Classically trained at a young
age, this British superproducer has gone on to become one of the most
eclectic and unique individuals working within elec- tronic music today.
Consistently escaping categorization, John.s genre-defying catalogue
spans the worlds of Electro, Trance and Drum & Bass, and a few other
spaces across the bpm spectrum. John.s career began in illustrious style
as the one and only Goldie picked up on this mild- mannered,
blonde-locked science graduate and his distinctive drum and bass beat
con- structions, and he was signed to the legendary Metalheadz label.
Tracks such as the euphoric .Up All Night. have become instant classics
in the canon of drum and bass, and repeatedly smashed dancefloors
worldwide. John B quickly became a headlining name on flyers across the
globe, and his touring schedule has been non-stop ever since. Establish-
ing his own stable of labels (Beta Recordings, Tangent, Chihuahua and
Nu_Electro) to reflect his diverse tastes from liquid funk to Latin,
provided the perfect platform for John.s groundbreaking sonic
experimentation to develop.

Gein
http://www.myspace.com/gein1

GEIN - habit, freak, tech itch, penatration, evol intent, moving shadow
Milwaukee GEIN, appropriately named after the Plainfield Wisconsin
pyscho Edward Gein, consists of The Butcher (formerly of Defiant),
Abel(MC) and Saint (founder Doon of Habit Recordings). Formed in early
2004, the crew linked up when Butcher moved from Los Angeles to
Milwaukee, joining Saint and Abel to create one of the most twisted
group of producers out there today. GEIN's sound can have a variety of
"labels", but BRUTAL comes to mind when most come to describe the
demented beats that are forged in the lab.

Coming off a scorching 2005, GEIN is set to take things ten steps
further in 2006. With an E.P. for Moving Shadow (Street Sweeper EP) and
a 12" for Freak (Hate / Father Of Lies) in the bag, GEIN's forthcoming
material is raising eyebrows across the board. Some current forthcoming
projects include a Habit 12" (Telepathy w/Bitfiendz / Hell) that has
been causing a ruckus around the world. Freak will be putting out an
E.P. consisting of GEIN and Arsenic's "b", "The Sermon", and two brand
new, still unfinished ones. Also on the chopping block, GEIN is remixing
Dylan's classic darkstepper "Witchcraft", as well as Technical Itch's
"Hex", two massive undertaking that they believe will raise the bar one
step further. Also lined up are collaborations with the likes of the
mighty Evol Intent,releases on Tech Freak & Defcom Recordings, and more
output on Habit / Freak. Plus let us not forget the SKINSUIT SESSIONS!


Spree & ADB

DJ Spree Turntable Innovator Minneapolis MN SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco 
Clothing
MC ADB Lyrical Engineer Lincoln NE SpreeAndAdb.com/Esdjco Clothing

DJ Spree and MC ADB have become a staple for hardcore stateside. The 
dynamic duo have played shows all over the world and after 7 years of 
terrorizing dance floors are back once again to rock the cave. Spree is 
without doubt the most well known and respected Happycore DJ in Americas 
history. No one can imitate the originator. Not only can he scratch like 
turntable fiend, but he also possesses the ability to turn a crowd into 
an instant frenzy with his record dropping intuition and understanding 
of what the hardcore army demands. Each time you see Spree memories come 
flooding back and at the same time new ones are created. He perfectly 
balances anthems of old with the latest sounds of today.

MC ADB is a very well known character in the realm of Hardcore and DnB. 
He can be seen flying up and down stages from London to Los Angeles and 
everywhere in between. His lyrical style is very high energy and 
compliments the speed of hardcore perfectly. Adb is originally from the 
UK and was heavily influenced by Hardcore from its very inception. This 
mic fiend is a throw-back to the original style Hardcore MC, and is 
simply here to entertain the crowd and compliment the DJ.

Get ready to blow those whistles and scream once again for your favorite 
duo, because it.s going to be Spree&Adb time! (Crash helmets not 
included).

anime punch, the armageddicon

"That's right, we go there. In fact, we've been there quite some time, 
and want you to join us!"

Last year was our first year open to non-OSU students, and you blew us 
away with how many of you showed up, so this year we're going all out. 
We've got a hotel, three full days, and all the fixin's.

However, this will not be your standard, run-of-the-mill, humdrum, 
hold-a-sign-in-the-lobby-that-says-"Will Glomp for 
Pocky"-for-three-hours-because-there-is-nothing-better-to-do Con. Oh no.

Welcome to Anime Punch, the first completely open-source anime con! Ever 
suggested an idea to another con only to have it rejected outright? Ever 
wish that other cons would do more? Ever had an idea you thought would 
be cool, but didn't know anyone in the con biz? Well guess what.WE are 
"that" con! We take every idea we get, and do our best to make it 
happen. Regardless of how difficult, crazy, stupid, or out-there the 
idea is, if it's vaguely anime-related and doesn't break any 
heavily-enforced laws we will strive to make it a reality.

April 7th - 9th, 2006

http://www.notacon.org/

NOTACON, an annual conference held in Cleveland, Ohio, explores and 
showcases technologies, philosophy and creativity often overlooked at 
other "hacker cons". Our desire is not to supplant other events, but 
complement them and strike a balance that has gone unnoticed in our 
community for far too long.

With each new year we build upon the successes and knowledge of the 
previous years. Our goal is to enlighten, educate, and entertain 
attendees, presenters, and staff alike. We try to do this by finding new 
ways to apply technology to graphics, art, music, or social interaction.

Our first year explored issues involving art and technology. Last year 
we scratched the surface of ways in which community is influenced (both 
positively and negatively) by technology. This year we will explore ways 
in which communication can affect technology and vice versa. Many 
presentations, games and other events will revolve (sometimes quite 
creatively) around this theme.

Notacon espouses an ethos of exploration, participation and positive 
contributions. Hence, while some of the material we may cover is 
controversial or potentially "black hat" in nature, we feel it is 
important to bring light to all topics so that everyone can learn from 
the experience and create something good, fun or interesting from it.

Events during Notacon will run from Friday morning through Sunday 
afternoon. These include over 40 presentations, contests such as 
"Anything but Ethernet", game shows, prize giveaways and a whole lot of 
who-knows-what. Anything can happen, and usually does.

Rave scene not to blame, says Seattle mayor By Martin Kasindorf, 
USA TODAY
Thu Mar 30, 6:59 AM ET

Despite seven violent deaths last weekend, the mayor and other 
city leaders have a reassuring message for the youths who love the 
all-night music and dancing of the "rave" party scene: Rave on.

Kyle Huff, 28, fatally shot six people and himself Saturday at an 
early-morning house party after a zombie-themed rave at a 
performing arts center. It was Seattle's worst crime since 1983, 
when 13 people were killed at a Chinatown gambling club. And it 
was the first such incident to mar the Pacific Northwest's rave 
culture, where partygoers and police have had an accord that some 
other U.S. localities haven't matched.

As a police task force continues searching for a motive for Huff's 
rampage, Mayor Greg Nickels told a community meeting Tuesday that 
the loud, pulsating electronic music featured at rave dances is 
"not a threat to us."

Rave parties now in the mainstream

"We don't know why he picked these particular victims," Nickels 
told the group. "We do know that this incident was not caused by 
music - a particular kind of music. It was caused by a disturbed 
individual who chose to take out his anger or rage on other human 
beings. As a society, we have got to come to grips with this 
infatuation that we have with guns."

Travis Webb, 29, a rave dance promoter here, said he had feared a 
crackdown, in part because two of the victims were girls ages 14 
and 15.

Those killed were Melissa Moore, 14; Suzanne Thorne, 15; 
Christopher Williamson, 21; Justin Schwartz, 22; Jeremy Martin, 
26; and Jason Travers, 32.

Raves were an underground phenomenon in the 1980s and '90s. The 
favored drug at raves was Ecstasy, which mellowed partygoers but 
gave them energy for night-long gyration, Webb said. By 2000, 
raves had gone mainstream, being held in clubs and sports arenas. 
Fire marshals and off-duty cops patrolled. Use of Ecstasy has 
declined, but marijuana often is sneaked past security guards, 
Webb and other promoters say.

Raves have turned violent in some places. At four illegal parties 
in Los Angeles in 2004, a total of five men were killed and seven 
were wounded.

But the rave scene in Seattle gave police "no problems to speak 
of" until Saturday's massacre in the quiet Capitol Hill district, 
police spokesman Sean Whitcomb said.

"I never thought it would happen in Seattle," said Aaron Chase, 
32, a regular at raves.

At a makeshift memorial outside the rented house where the 
killings occurred, Shane Wicker, 21, described the close-knit 
party community as "trusting and accepting everyone."

Gary Williamson, whose son Christopher was killed, was in tears 
during a prayer service at the scene of the slayings. He thanked 
the ravers for accepting a young man who'd "felt like an outcast." 
"Your friendships touched him and filled a void that the school 
couldn't fill, the church couldn't fill," Williamson said.

Huff moved to Seattle with his twin brother, Kane, five years ago 
from Whitefish, Mont. The brothers, at 6-foot-5 and 270 pounds, 
were voted "least spirited" by Whitefish High School classmates 
because they wouldn't play football or other sports.

Searching now for early signs of trouble, people in Whitefish 
point to an incident in 2000 when Huff shot at a life-size moose 
sculpture. The two guns used in the vandalism were those used in 
Seattle, said Whitefish Assistant Police Chief Mike Ferda.

Pickup was loaded with weapons

Wicker said he saw Huff at a rave on March 17. "A couple of my 
friends were hanging out with him at another after-party," Wicker 
said.

Last weekend's rave was promoted with the theme of "Better Off 
Undead," and people were invited to wear white face paint, said 
Webb, who attended. "We focus on themes and costumes to try to 
pull kids away from drugs, give them a new focus at the events," 
Webb said. Pierce Dyer, 20, said the event was like a Halloween 
party. Webb said security at the zombie rave was "strong," with 
four guards checking for guns and drugs at the door and others in 
the smoking area and on patrol.

Seattle Deputy Police Chief Clark Kimerer said Huff had 
"premeditated" the slayings that night, loading his pickup with 
weapons and more than 300 rounds of ammunition. Webb said the 
guards may have deterred Huff from shooting at the dance.

According to a police affidavit, several of the six men who lived 
at the Capitol Hill house decided to invite Huff to their party 
when the rave wound down at 4 a.m. Saturday. None knew him. 
"Standing on the sidelines," he gave off "bad vibes" that might be 
fun at the party, Anthony Moulton, 25, told detectives.

Shortly before 7 a.m., the police affidavit says, Huff left the 
party. Fetching the weapons from his truck, he spray-painted "NOW" 
on the front steps of three houses. He approached the porch of the 
house and started shooting. Police officer Steve Leonard heard the 
shooting and rushed to the house. When Huff saw the officer, he 
killed himself.

Later, friends of the victims placed flowers, candles and beads 
outside the house. They played techno music and camped out in 
tents. And they danced. "The best way we're going to mourn is by 
celebrating," Dyer said. "We're not going to stop dancing."

Police say they don't have an answer yet for why Huff turned into 
a killer. "A year from now, we may still be asking that question," 
Kimerer said. Others have theories. "He tried to fit in, and it 
didn't work for him," Chase said.

Wow, almost makes me want to move to seattle...

Cool Mayor. Most politicians would see this as an opportunity to trash
today's youth and the "fringe".

We all know why Huff did it... it's all that damn rain, and too many
Starbucks.

<br>Christopher Williamson, 21; Justin Schwartz, 22; Jeremy Martin,<br>26; =
and Jason Travers, 32.<br><br>Raves were an underground phenomenon in the 1=
980s and '90s. The
<br>favored drug at raves was Ecstasy, which mellowed partygoers but<br>gav=

t four illegal parties<br>in Los Angeles in 2004, a total of five men were =

 problems to speak<br>of&quot; until Saturday's massacre in the quiet Capit=
ol Hill district,<br>police spokesman Sean Whitcomb said.<br><br>&quot;I ne=
ver thought it would happen in Seattle,&quot; said Aaron Chase,
<br>32, a regular at raves.<br><br>At a makeshift memorial outside the rent=
ed house where the<br>killings occurred, Shane Wicker, 21, described the cl=
ose-knit<br>party community as &quot;trusting and accepting everyone.&quot;
<br><br>Gary Williamson, whose son Christopher was killed, was in tears<br>=
during a prayer service at the scene of the slayings. He thanked<br>the rav=
ers for accepting a young man who'd &quot;felt like an outcast.&quot;<br>
&quot;Your friendships touched him and filled a void that the school<br>cou=

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Seattle Mayor Says Rave Scene Not to Blame

Yes, very word.  If the police were only that cool around here.  Closest
place around here is Toronto.  First time we had a problem there was
last weekend when some idiot decided to pull the fire alarm.  But I chat
up with the paramedics and people up there all the time.

Not only is sending an unsolicited email list to people unprofessional  
sending a mass email in which the recipients are not "BCC'd" is wrong as 
well. I would imagine that most people you sent this email to would 
agree. Please take me off your email list if you are going to use my 
email address in such a way. Thank you.

Subject: {pb-cle} goodfellaz last week in toronto

http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/2006-03-25-goodfellaz

probably have more pictures out of amandas camera sometime soon

cut/pasted from the blog::::::

so we again trekked up to toronto in search of a party. 5 of us piled 
into bills car and headed north. kinda lollygagged on the way up, picked 
up jenns camera and flyers. but we didn't have anything lined up 
beforehand other than popping in at elijahs.

border crossing. the guy asked i think 2 questions and mumbled 
something. bill seemed confused and had to ask, he mumbled again. he was 
pretty drawn into his newspaper. definately painless.

stopped at elijahs, chilled a bit and then headed over to the big bop. 
kinda a new experience for us, they used a different side of the venue 
and had 2 rooms. like this layout better than the other side they've 
used for the past year or so.

music in the main room was to die for. well 95% of it. the upstairs was 
the alternative to hardcore, and mostly wasn't very interesting other 
than this psytrance live PA. dharma lab. pretty good stuff. the rest of 
the times i went up there was pretty dullsville. mostly a change of scenery.

music was spot on. i actually danced. madness.

flyered for a cleveland party at the end of things, then ended up at 
elijahs for a few hours of random nothingness, but it was fun. i like 
hanging out at his place, the people there are always sooper nice.

still up here right now in the hotel, prolly leaving soon, prolly have 
the pictures up in a day or 3. keep u'r eyes out for em....

--------------------------

so the goodfellaz party was fucking off the charts. some minor but 100% 
totally expected and 95% ignorable bullshit aside, this self-titled 
party was fan-fucking-tabulous. repeat: i fucking danced. jessica likes 
to think it was her, more the fucking awesome music, and whatever it is 
they put in the water up there??

anyhow to pick up where the last entry left off. eat some ass pizza, hop 
in the car and head home.

therein lies the depressing bit.

you come up on the duty free shop, contemplate buying a totally random 
bottle of whiskey and realize you have to deal with the US terrorist 
specialists. last few times have mostly been painless other than some 
whining over birth certificates. maybe they've bored of harassing 
everyone? or have narrowed down their profiling? not sure? least they're 
not standing there to greet us with soldiers with machine guns any more. 
yey for US hospitality. anyhow after the customs entering the US you 
enter the vast wasteland of buffalo. barf. it looks like it smells. head 
thru pennsyltuckee, then realize you're headed back to NE ohio which has 
no scene, thus the whole trip to toronto.

seriously. i want the US customs to make such a stink that i have no 
choice but to head back to canada and plead for asylum or whatever keeps 
me there. seriously. i really never want to come back to the US. ok, so 
the SW has nicer weather than canada, but isn't what i'm looking for. 
any smart cute nightlife sensitive canadians looking to help out a poor 
american loser? please? aside from being a bit of an asshole and a 
"techno-snob" i'm kinda a nice guy.

Ahh Hell-to-da-Nooooooo!

This is ignorant...

"you can take the crackhead out of the ghetto...but you can't take the ghetto
out of the...um, yeah."

"Somebody needs to switch her to crystal meth... she'll have that mess cleaned
up in under two hours."

At first, I didn't believe anything on that forum.  People like to bash everyone
it seems like.  Too many assholes out there.  After further investigation,
though, yep, it's true, and it's a shame, though.  Such a talented person, like
her or not (gotta give her credit where credit's due.)  Bobby Brown is sending
her straight to Hell. So many people are hooked on some type of shit that it's
pitiful.

It's one thing to realize that the music industry and almost everyone in it are
fucked up.  Then again, about everyone is fucked up.  Just recently, Randy
Moss' agent/lawyer is apparently hooked on crack, too.  They busted him a few
weeks ago in a hotel.  Coke was practically everywhere.

Let's think about this rationally for one moment.

You can't POSSIBLY be married to Bobby fucking Brown for that long and
NOT be hooked on SOMETHING.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} goodfellaz last week in toronto

Yep, we were at the rest area in NY and a couple of people there were  
like "i f***ing hate america" .  I like how when we were at elijah's  
place after the party we (the only americans there) could stop  
talking about how good the gabber was and jen mos' set and pretty  
much everyone's set and all the other people there did like the  
gabber because it made them feel angry.  We were all like "YEAH, ITS  
GREAT!"  Us angry americans.  And then traaaat and I are going to a  
gabber party in cincy... after going to an anime con in columbus...  
(yeah, we're geeks)

Anyone else see the Pittsburgh TV news story trying to tie the seattle
shooting to the upcoming Pittsburgh rave "Koolaid: Electrolaid Punch" ?
Pathetic. Oh well at least the promoters got free TV advertising. Apparentl=
y
there will be mass undercover cops and bigtime security at Electrolaid
Punch.

Too bad Pittsburghers don't have the sensibility of the Seattlers... OTOH,
no Pittsburghers have done a shooting rampage to my knowledge.

<br>&gt; favored drug at raves was Ecstasy, which mellowed partygoers but<b=
r>&gt; gave them energy for night-long gyration, Webb said. By 2000,<br>&gt=
; raves had gone mainstream, being held in clubs and sports arenas.<br>
&gt; Fire marshals and off-duty cops patrolled. Use of Ecstasy has<br>&gt; =
declined, but marijuana often is sneaked past security guards,<br>&gt; Webb=
 and other promoters say.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Raves have turned violent in some=
 places. At four illegal parties
<br>&gt; in Los Angeles in 2004, a total of five men were killed and seven<=
br>&gt; were wounded.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; But the rave scene in Seattle gave po=
lice &quot;no problems to speak<br>&gt; of&quot; until Saturday's massacre =
in the quiet Capitol Hill district,
<br>&gt; police spokesman Sean Whitcomb said.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;I never=
 thought it would happen in Seattle,&quot; said Aaron Chase,<br>&gt; 32, a =
regular at raves.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; At a makeshift memorial outside the rente=
d house where the
<br>&gt; killings occurred, Shane Wicker, 21, described the close-knit<br>&=
gt; party community as &quot;trusting and accepting everyone.&quot;<br>&gt;=
<br>&gt; Gary Williamson, whose son Christopher was killed, was in tears
<br>&gt; during a prayer service at the scene of the slayings. He thanked<b=
r>&gt; the ravers for accepting a young man who'd &quot;felt like an outcas=
t.&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Your friendships touched him and filled a void that =
the school
<br>&gt; couldn't fill, the church couldn't fill,&quot; Williamson said.<br=
>&gt;<br>&gt; Huff moved to Seattle with his twin brother, Kane, five years=
 ago<br>&gt; from Whitefish, Mont. The brothers, at 6-foot-5 and 270 pounds=
,
<br>&gt; were voted &quot;least spirited&quot; by Whitefish High School cla=
ssmates<br>&gt; because they wouldn't play football or other sports.<br>&gt=
;<br>&gt; Searching now for early signs of trouble, people in Whitefish
<br>&gt; point to an incident in 2000 when Huff shot at a life-size moose<b=
r>&gt; sculpture. The two guns used in the vandalism were those used in<br>=
&gt; Seattle, said Whitefish Assistant Police Chief Mike Ferda.<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; Pickup was loaded with weapons<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Wicker said he saw =
Huff at a rave on March 17. &quot;A couple of my<br>&gt; friends were hangi=
ng out with him at another after-party,&quot; Wicker<br>&gt; said.<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; Last weekend's rave was promoted with the theme of &quot;Better Of=
f<br>&gt; Undead,&quot; and people were invited to wear white face paint, s=
aid<br>&gt; Webb, who attended. &quot;We focus on themes and costumes to tr=
y to
<br>&gt; pull kids away from drugs, give them a new focus at the events,&qu=
ot;<br>&gt; Webb said. Pierce Dyer, 20, said the event was like a Halloween=
<br>&gt; party. Webb said security at the zombie rave was &quot;strong,&quo=
t; with
<br>&gt; four guards checking for guns and drugs at the door and others in<=
br>&gt; the smoking area and on patrol.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Seattle Deputy Poli=
ce Chief Clark Kimerer said Huff had<br>&gt; &quot;premeditated&quot; the s=
layings that night, loading his pickup with
<br>&gt; weapons and more than 300 rounds of ammunition. Webb said the<br>&=
gt; guards may have deterred Huff from shooting at the dance.<br>&gt;<br>&g=
t; According to a police affidavit, several of the six men who lived<br>
&gt; at the Capitol Hill house decided to invite Huff to their party<br>&gt=
; when the rave wound down at 4 a.m. Saturday. None knew him.<br>&gt; &quot=
;Standing on the sidelines,&quot; he gave off &quot;bad vibes&quot; that mi=
ght be
<br>&gt; fun at the party, Anthony Moulton, 25, told detectives.<br>&gt;<br=
>&gt; Shortly before 7 a.m., the police affidavit says, Huff left the<br>&g=
t; party. Fetching the weapons from his truck, he spray-painted &quot;NOW&q=
uot;
<br>&gt; on the front steps of three houses. He approached the porch of the=
<br>&gt; house and started shooting. Police officer Steve Leonard heard the=
<br>&gt; shooting and rushed to the house. When Huff saw the officer, he
<br>&gt; killed himself.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Later, friends of the victims plac=
ed flowers, candles and beads<br>&gt; outside the house. They played techno=
 music and camped out in<br>&gt; tents. And they danced. &quot;The best way=
 we're going to mourn is by
<br>&gt; celebrating,&quot; Dyer said. &quot;We're not going to stop dancin=

uff turned into<br>&gt; a killer. &quot;A year from now, we may still be as=
king that question,&quot;
<br>&gt; Kimerer said. Others have theories. &quot;He tried to fit in, and =
