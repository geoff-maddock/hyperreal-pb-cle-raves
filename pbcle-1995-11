Hi everybody,

sorry for the massive crosspost but I think this should be interesting
to at least some people everywhere.  Version 2.0 of DJ ONLINE starts
this Thursday at 6:30 Eastern.  If you weren't around earlier this
year when we did the first series, DJ ONLINE is a regular weekly thing
where DJs and musicians from the scene are invited onto VRAVE for you,
the people, to talk to them :)  If you don't know what vrave is, ask
your friends :) or try it yourself (telnet hyperreal.com 7283) any
time.  Anyway, DJ Online 2.0 starts this Thursday and will happen every
Thursday (except for holidays) at 6:30 pm Eastern until at least mid-
January.  Here's the (very tentative) schedule.  I think it will probably
be on channel two of vrave.

Nov  2 - KEOKI and SOULSLINGER
Nov  9 - DB and JOESKI
Nov 16 - JAMES CHRISTIAN, JASON JINX, MIKE DEARBORN and TERRY MULLAN
Nov 30 - DEEP DISH and SCOTT HENRY
Dec  7 - HEATHER HEART and ADAM X
Dec 14 - NIGEL RICHARDS and DJ ORION
Dec 21 - KIMBALL COLLINS
Coming in January - RITCHIE HAWTIN, JOHN ACQUAVIVA, PROTOTYPE 909, JOHN
SELWAY, SCOTT RICHMOND

If you have any questions, please e-mail me at speakman@biost.mskcc.org.
Please also mail me there if you (1) have any suggestions for people
we should invite onto DJ Online, or (2) live in/near Orlando or Detroit
and would like to host a DJ Online from there (you should be able to
figure out which ones :))

But please DON'T do a REPLY to this message unless you are ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN it will go to just me and not to the huge list of mailing lists
in the Cc: line.  If you're not certain, please just mail me at the above
address.  Thanks!

Let's not say die, but it looks like it is changing.  Even if the ROM 
doesn't exist as it used to, the list is still helpfull in some basic 
information serving sense.  It looks like Steve has been posting Ohio 
stuff as he found out about it, why not just have each member post flyer 
info when (s)he finds a flyer or hears about a Rave?  I could help 
compile info if we still want one cohesive/coherent ROM.

yeah, I noticed this. I found it worthy and was bummed to see it's 
disappearance.  Do you have any statistics on the hits for that 
page?  I checked it every so often just to see how it had changed (which 
usually wasn't very much), but I know there are at least some relevant 
links that it could point to, like Webspace for UDG, Orbit Records, First 
Class Music, Breaks, Jungle-nut, etc.  How about if everyone who has a 
relevent website posts the addy here, or sends it to Tom?  If anyone 
wants help with HTML or wants a home page, I'm sure there are list 
members who could help out.

That's the way ROMs usually work.  I know no one travels around to 
everywhere in the region collecting flyers to post to the list, but it is 
really useful if people would post information to the list ... that way 
it would be easy to compile a ROM.  Right now, the ROM responsibilities 
are up for grabs.  Someone who goes to a fair number of raves and gets a 
bunch of fliers would be the perfect person to undertake it, but it's not 
really a big deal.  

> yeah, I noticed this. I found it worthy and was bummed to see it's 
> disappearance.  Do you have any statistics on the hits for that 

the page got a fair number of hits, but it was in need of re-designing.  
A Hyperreal staff person (hi eric :) is finishing the final touches on a 
tool that will give you a list of events in certain areas automatically, 
based on information posted to the database or to the lists.

The new pb-cle web page will definitely have links for this system.  I 
was working on a similar tool before I accidentally wiped the pages away.

As far as the web stuff goes, here's what you can do to make the site 
something worth checking out:

	1- send me URLs of sites to link to.  UDG, pb-cle djs, artists, etc.
	2- send me URLs of *your* homepages.
	3- post rave info to the list
	4- upload pictures/stuff to hyperreal

the pictures thing is pretty cool.  I was working on a big collage of 
images, but all of a sudden, people stopped putting stuff in the folder.  
If you have pictures of people on the list or pictures from parties, 
etc., scan them!  I'll be happy to put them up on the web site.

Later today I'll email instructions on how to upload material to 
hyperreal and how to download it.

welp since nobody else posted a review for it, here's my belated
review...

DIMENSIONS - 10/28 - Cleveland, OH
----------------------------------

me & monica got to the agora @ 12:30am. thanx go out to chris for
the free comps. we really appreciated it cuz it wuz the $20 door
cover that kept some people (including russ) away. unbelieveably
the main hall wuz packed @ 12:30am and i wuz bombarded by old
acquaintances some of which i hadn't seen in ages: holly (still
the hottest rave chica out there), mandy from y-town, even alex
from pittsburgh (jenna's old buddy) came out from hiding for this
party. hadn't seen him since Groove Ride. speakin of which, Goofy
wuz there too. he still owes my friend jenny $2K for that party.
even erica & amy, who never go out anymore showed up @ the party.
other pitt kids in the house: dj x-on and john from udg inc., who
gave me the boom! flyers. sorry 'bout all this personal rambling,
but this wuz what made my night seeing all these old rave buds,
that i hadn't seen in ages!

ok, i've been hard on spawntaneous cuz their past few events
weren't organized too well. but this party certainly redeemed them.
not even the overly anal guards that checked too hard @ the door
dampened my evening. for once everything went smoothly despite
the fact that there wuz no written dj schedule ala spawntaneous
tradition. and for the first time the agora concert hall wuz
utilized to its capacity: they packed the house w/ over a thousand
kids. easily the largest rave ever held in the agora, even bigger
than Wonderland. both dance floors: main & back were consistently
packed. even the bleachers didn't suck up the bopping ravahs this
time.

when i got there casual wuz on the tables w/ some dude on the mc.
oh yeah for once a decently mc'ed party - just enuff to be not too
annoying. casual from oakland california spun an interesting
trip hop set, but not my flava. for all u jungle freaks out there,
u would've been in seventh heaven with the likes of: jj jellybean,
phantom 45, scorpion, and tik tak. there wuz even alot of old
skool hip hop from local hip hop king dj swamp. but the hip hop
highlight of the night wuz Q-Bert from san fran, '92, '93, '94
DMC World Champ scrathin' like i've never seen - unfuckingbelievable!
big surprise: he's asian not black. but the true highlight of the
night atleast for me wuz T-1000 blowing the roof in the back room
and then again in the main room. he along w/ my local fav dj gank
were the only ones to get me to throw down on the dance floor.
altho me & doughboy were having fun yelling @ Gank to get off the
tables so T-1000 could get on.

other highlights of the party: mind blowing visual stimulation thru
eyegasm's lighting mastery. bobby in his silver outfit & platforms,
the only ravah dressed up that night that i saw. alcohol bar that
wuz selling zimas for a buck - gotta luv that!

only downer: some loser metalhead bumped me in the face w/ his cigarette 
on purpose (lucky i had my visor on or i'd have a nice cigarette burn
on my nose). so i dropped my plur for a few seconds and followed him
w/ a few dance kicks when he wuzn't looking. unfortunately his friend
informed him of what i did & he threatened to kick my ass. so i sed
fuck this shit & headed to the back vip rooms to snap some pics of
the dj's. well i guess dats my .02 on the whole smoking thread on 
ne-raves. i don't have a problem w/ smokers 'til u try burning me
in the face w/ one of yur ciggs!

one more thing: there were no plrm's dropped off at this party,
partially due to a promise i made to gank, partially due to the
contents of the new issue, partially cuz i wanted to make some
changes & add a few things. so if u got one personally from me, 
u were lucky. they're becoming scarce & high in demand especially
in cleveland now.

For those of you with web, access, you'll want to check out GRID, the 
Global Rave Information Database at Hyperreal.  The grid allows you to 
view weekly events and raves in pretty much every region in the world as 
well as enter rave data yourself.

The URL is:

	http://hyperreal.com/~eric/cal.html

It's still in testing, so some things may not work, but when more and 
more people upload data to the GRID, it will more a much more valuable 
information source.

The new pb-cle web site will feature grid output in the form of a ROM, 
and it will be updated constantly... so it will always have the right 
information.

So... perhaps the solution to the ROM problem is to just enter data into 
the GRID.  That way, instead of someone having to assemble the ROM every 
week, you can just look at the GRID web page and get the information you 
need.

Any ideas?

Ok folks, just a little post to clear things up.
No, I am not dead.
Yes it is true that I could have died. Yes it is true I had a 106 degree 
temperature, and a swollen esophagus and epiglotis thereby cutting of my 
breath (but not complete enough to die).
Yes its true I was severely dehydrated to the point of them having to put 
an IV in me to fill me back up with fluid.
Yes its true my doc said that had I spent one more day in 
NYC without medical attention its a strong possibility I would have died.
But no, I am alive and kicking and am doing fine now that I'm on 
antibiotics,and percoset(fun stuff).

By the way bigup the man like John Speakman, Sarah S, Will-E, and the 
rest of the 12B crew who went WAY BEYOND PLUR and community to help me 
through this difficult time. Especially thanks for carrying my equipment 
back to 12 B after I was finished with my PA. I don't think I could have 
done it myself. 

By the way I had fun at Maskarave, what little time I was there. It seems 
those of you that went did too. I would have hung around longer but I was 
in pretty bad condition with a 106 degree temerature. 

Anyway now the big question, how did you like my set?

*HUG*

Hello fellow ravers,

I'm not on your list but the d-raves list family needs your help.

A local Dallas TV station is running a report on raves.

Marty Griffin and Sabrina Smith, the two Channel 5 "Public Defender"
        investigative reporters, went to a party with hidden cameras
         and video'd peeps that appeared to
        be buying, selling, and ingesting what they said were drugs.

        i can't go into detail now, but the gist of the report was that
        parties are primarily "secret teenage underground gatherings"
        that are rife with drugs.

And we need to get a good show of feedback to the station. Please send
e-mail to:

kxas@pic.net

A short message in support of raves would be great.

Thank you for your support.

Take Care,
jared

          . . . . . . . . . . . .   . . . . .   . . . .


hello everyone- welcome to enews nine.  we've been busy putting
together some new projects and releasing our latest record, induction's
halodust single, as well as constructing our new web site.  so here is
a quick run-down of our current projects.

[halodust]

we released halodust on monday, october 16, and already it's doing very
well.  all the feedback we've gotten from it so far has been very positive,
and all of us are pleased.  if you'd like to hear samples of the music,
take a look at our web site (url listed below).  your local record store
should be able to order halodust; if you can't find it, please contact us.

[or003: .x09]

our next release, .x09's fzz ep, will feature four songs of experimental
house atmospheres.  .x09's approach to sounds and constructing songs is
much different than anything we've heard.  drum machines and sampled 
percussion takes on a completely new feel with .x09's use of abrasive
processing techniques, but the end result is still very musical and 
evocative.

no release date for the fzz ep has been set, but orbitrecords expects to
release it in mid-december.  as always, we will keep you informed as more
developments happen.  you can hear a clip of one of the songs featured
on the fzz ep, statika, by visiting our web site.

[the cumulonimbus]

wes pearson is currently in the studio preparing tracks for his first 
release as the cumulonimbus.  orbitrecords has distributed a small 
number of promotional tapes featuring his 1994 track overcast, and 
feedback has been more than positive so far.  we feel pearson's unique
blend of textured sounds and sampled percussion is truly innovative,
and like all orbitrecords projects, the music exudes a distinct feeling.
overcast along with several new songs pearson is working on right now
will be featured on the first release from the cumulonimbus.

a clip of overcast is available at the orbitrecords web site as well.

[ad infinitum]

so with the new .x09 ep, the cumulonimbus ep, and more work from induction
all slated to release in the next few months, we have our work cut out
for us.  we hope you take a look at our new web site and listen to some
of our new music.  as always, if you have any questions or comments for
us, please do not hesitate to call or email us.

Well I'll keep this short.
This party was PHAT! At first I thought "uh oh, this space is TOO nice" 
but as it turned out the vibe was excellent.
For those of you who don't know, Passion was held in a hotel ballroom 
converted to a club. It was very big for the rather sizeable crowd, 
(proving once again that Pittsburgh CAN support yet another new crew, The 
Sunshine Kids).

The Lights, pretty good. fair amount of intellabeams.
The Sound: not as bad as I thought it would be. low at first but very 
loud during DB's set (yay!)
The People: Incredible, while there were plenty of old faces there were 
also plenty of new ones I suspect as a result of Free II (The UDG party 
at Carnegie Science Centre) proving my point again that if you want new 
blood in the scene you have to throw an ABOVEGROUND, mainstream party to 
get those new faces. Anyway not only was it a fairly new crowd but they 
were having a blast, they danced all night even through DB's excellent 
jungle set. (He was worried, when I asked if he'd spin jungle he said, "I 
will but only if people keep dancing to it.) Well needless to say his set 
was the highpoint of my night, starting off with really cool acid, 
progressing through old school breaks ala Awesome 's "Don't Go", Sonz of 
a Loop De Loop Era's "Far Out" and I believe House Crew's "Euphoria". it 
really felt like an old school party at this point, people dancing on 
stage people blowing whistles, etc. Then he spun Origin Unknown's Valley 
of the Shadows which kicked off this excellent jungle set which only 
ended when he decided to spin some happy hardcore to finish off his 
nearly 2.5 hour set. He spun an excellent happy hardcore track which 
sampled Van Halen's "Jump". Alll and all everyone I spoke to said this 
set was THE BOMB. Best of the night even though there were quite a few 
good sets spun, like the one Chris Fortier spun, if you dig house and 
slow breaks it would have been right up your alley.
All and all the Sunshine Kids have proved themselves on their first 
party. Lets hope for many more. They have it together. While I had a 
blast at Bassrush II and Maskarave IV I felt "at home" at this
party. Pittsburgh definately has its own character and I am glad to see 
we still have it.
Sunshine Kids, Excellent Party! Here's to many more!

    This definitely topped the UDG events I've been to as far as
atmosphere and feel - the progression from house to acid to break to
jungle to hardcore and then back down was much smoother and less jarring
than the long,long jungle sets at FREE and Perpetual Motion.  The place
was nice and warm and not too big - lots of nice people.  The only
reason I left was because they cut the sound for Rob Paine - it was good
grooves, but without the main speakers it lost a lot.

    I liked the long house set - I really dig that.  Much more mellow to
dance to.

    So when's the next Sunshine production?  And is anybody going to
DoIt! on the 9th of Dec.?

    I was at passion and agree with Kennith.  The Groves dished out were
some of the finest I have heard in pittsburgh so far.  The deep house dj
played some great tunes, I was impressed and excited when he played
egyption lover.  Some of his mixes were a bit sketchy but his selection
of music made up for it.  Chris Fortier was next with some good house. 
Followed by a very dynamic set by db.  He started out with some ambient
acid slowly building to some breaks and jungle.  His ending with the
song that sample jump was phat.  He really had the floor moving.  Rob
Pain came on next with a nice progressive house set going on after db. 
Too bad they had to lower the music when he came on.  Maybee we'll get a
chance to see him at the next sunshine kids party.

well...let me just say that this was a pretty phat party...tho anyone
who knows me knows that i'm a jungle nut and was therefore disappointed
by the amount that i got...but i shouldn't have expected it, only DB
plays it, so...
i was kinda tired, tho, so i didn't dance like the _whole_ night...spent
a lot of time trying new tricks and getting F***eD uP...i am sooooo
sore.  all for 1 or 2 new moves.  but, as anyone who read my interview
in the CMU newspaper about dancing knows, "the pain is worth it."  ;)
the one thing my whole kru agreed on was that there were many, many phly
individuals there...who's that genie over there in the silver pants? ;)

Hi everyone--

the new website is up.  Most of the graphics have changed, and there are 
a couple new sections on it, so let me explain:

list archives section:

so the list is archived now... the web pages are updated every hour with 
the latest stuff posted to the list.  So if you're looking for directions 
but accidentally lost the message, just cruise over the archives, and 
you'll find it.  :)

subscribe section:

this is pretty simple.  it tells you how to subscribe.  

events:

this part doesn't work yet.  partly because no one's doing a rom... 
anyway, it will have a ROM in the future there as well as flyers/whatever 
people submit.  now, you can link from it to the GRID database... if the 
grid is going to work, people need to enter information to it.  check it 
out, it's actually really cool: http://hyperreal.com/~eric/cal.html

pictures:

pictures of pb-cle people or parties or whatever.  there aren't many now, 
so why doesn't everyone scan a bunch and upload them to hyperreal? 

that's about it.  if you have any questions, send them to me.

does anyone know who's track this is?  the "jump" one i mean.  and where can
i find it?

this was deff. a great Rave, but one small complaint...i think that 4
straight hours of one type of music is too much.  whether it's house or
jungle or trance or goa.  from around 11 to db's set was all house, unless
you count slick 50's hiphop set which was short and there were plenty of
technical difficulties during it.  am i wrong?  just wondering  why db
was the only jungle dj booked?

THINK - 11/4/95 - Cleveland, OH
-------------------------------

When Lisa & i arrived at the Aragon ballroom @ 12:30pm,
they were still doing sound checks, so after dropping 
off a stack of PLRMs on a table by the lighting booth,
we got a drink at the bar. Finally around 1am Synapse 
opened up. Dave was a good opening choice. As soon as he 
started, kids (including myself) got on the floor & started
dancing. i guess kids were itching to dance as much as i 
was & Dave's hard house set was very dancer friendly.

Mr. Dearborn was next & kept the vibe up by spinnin track
after track of his style of chicago acid. lotsa new stuff i
hadn't heard before, probably his own records. btw Mike
what was that green record u spun near the beginning? oh
man, that track just took over my body. usually when an
incredible dj is on, i spend more time studying his 
technique. but sometimes the music just takes control & my 
focus goes from the dj to worshipping those huge speakers 
stacks. oh yeah, props to Thunder & Lighting for the thumpin
Turbosound & the spectacular light show. i think they had to
adjust the speakers about a half a dozen times due to all 
the rattling from all that bass.

after Dearborn, i finally got to see Gene Farris in real
life. i guess after being all wacked out on drugs before,
u tend not to notice who's spinnin. but when u finally 
start going to partys clean u can't help but stare @ the
dj's. It's pretty amazing to finally see the source of
where all that Incredible music is coming from and mr.
Farris definitely did not dissapoint.

Rob Rage & the columbus crew arrived a bit late, but i was 
glad to see that rob brought his secret weapon...Liedra,
instant vibe creator! i couldn't help but stand there &
smile when this pretty little rave machine (tm) took to the
floor. after dancing around this strange guy who was just 
sitting there in front of the speakers taking up valuable
dance space, i soon joined her & she gave me a big hug. i 
guess this is my response to obin's question on ne-raves
on what makes u dance - seeing yur fav dance buds throwing
down really gets me going, of course rage's phenominal hard
acid set definitely helped it out too. afterwards i 
introduced myself to the floor sitter & explained it's bad 
ravah manners to sit on the dance floor especially in front 
of the speakers.

it was around this time that my friend lisa informed me she 
was feeling sick & tired & wanted to leave. i really, really
wanted to see Carl Craig & i thought i could catch a ride 
off one of my friends @ the party, so i told her it was ok to
leave without me (little did i realize how difficult it was 
to catch a ride off someone these daze!).

talk about old skool, Carl came on w/ this big ole 'fro comb
stuck in his hair, funky! me & my other columbus dance bud,
Jonathan took front row seats (there actually was a bench
in front of the tables for us trainspotters) and watched
the master @ work. but both shannon & i agreed his selection
was keen but his mixing wasn't as tight as we thought it
would be. 

we were all a bit surprised when dan curtin joined our
trainspottin posse. after introducing him to jonathan who 
actually was one of his biggest fans, i was a bit dissapointed 
to find that he didn't recall that i was involved with the 
1961 Ford Partys on the Case Campus, where he first played 
live at. just goes to show yah there is no glory in the 
underground party throwin biz. i was even more dissapointed 
when he said he couldnt give me a ride home. but the biggest
downer was when Casey joined our trainspottin posse & just
totally lit up right in front of the dj booth, especially 
when he knew that some of us had cleaned up our act. i guess 
that was my best move of the night, turning down the joint in
front of all those rave kids right in front of the dj booth. 
and of course Casey, who i took home after Soul Generations
couldn't get me a ride home either!

it was around this time that my focus went from the music 
to trying to find a ride home. so i asked Jenny, who i took
to baltimore for Bassrush 2 (an 8 hour trek from cleveland 
and then from columbus), if she could give me a ride & she
couldn't cuz she lived on the west side. i asked Christen &
her sister, who i took to toronto (a 6 hour trek) for last
year's Pleasure Force Party, and they couldn't cuz they 
were too fucked up on drugs. i asked Nick, who i took to IO2 
(a 10 hour drive from cleveland) & he couldn't cuz he was 
too busy looking for drugs! i'm sorry but i was a little
dissapointed in my so called friends! 

finally Dan the Man Spam from Akron, club kid Rick from 
cleveland, and their friends came thru for me. actually it 
was a good thing he did cuz when we walked out, we discovered
Dan's car had been towed. and after we stuffed in Rick's car & 
arrived @ the lot, i was the one who paid for the majority of 
the bill to get the car out. after that it was green lights
the whole way home. i guess i did something right that night.

i'll hafta admit this party definitely lived up to its name.
after the party i thought alot. i thought about how strange
it wuz that we never hit a single red light on the way home
(this never happens especially in cleveland), i thought 
about how i had exactly 42 dollars in my pocket, exactly
what we needed to get Dan's car out (42 also being the
answer to life, the universe, & everything according to
Douglas Adams). i thought about how lucky i wuz to find
Dan & later Dan to have found me. Another strange coincidence 
wuz that it wuz Dan who introduced me to Chinagrrrl, who i
interviewed in my last zine along w/ JJ (another chance 
meeting also). then i thought about how i met all the 
people i interviewed: scott forbush, trevor lamont, rob 
sherwood, mike filly, lisa lee, sleepy c, dave trance, 
frosty freeze, carlos, brian wheeler, rick deshields, joe 
lesesne, lonnie fisher, and most recently tom & chip. they 
were all chance meetings. i never planned for any of 'em. 
they just happened to be there. and the provocative thing wuz
each one had an important message when i interviewed them.
even the people who did articles for me: ecto, spike,
andy, alex, jenny, eliabeth, peter, lollipop, etc. all
chance meetings. all with an important message. i just 
happened to be the one doing the zine to collect their
messages & distribute it to everybody else. b'jesus, even
my distributors: star, jonathan, dj johnny fingers, ben,
dj steven kaye, lollipop, xelibrium, jenna, hannibal, 
citrus, sinn, tiggah...all coincidental, all volunteers. 
now my journey has come full circle. i've communicated the
messages the best i could. fate has helped me along the
way, by bringing me to the people to help me with the 
message. i hope it reaches those that need to hear it.
and i hope it can bring forth a more positive future,
where technology does not sacrifice humanity.

peace.love.unity.respect to those that truly understand,

will do.

yeah the grid is great.  there are some problems with getting it to work 
right now, and they're being worked on... as far as the rom goes, if no 
one who goes to a lot of parties picks up doing it, i'll generate a rom 
each week from the GRID database and post it to both the web site and to 
the list.  Since no one is doing it right now, and since there aren't 
many (like... oh, 1) events for pb-cle in the grid, i'm not going to 
bother with it right now.

(cc:pb-cle-raves since it pertains to le list-o)

Subject: Are You Preapred?
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com

The Problem:

                Most companies require a pre-employment drug test.
                If you are seeking employment, on probation, or in
                the military, you will have to take a drug test.  

Another Problem:

		Eating the wrong breakfast, or using certain over-the-
                counter pain relievers will falsely identify you as 
                a drug user.

The Real Problem:

		Public and private employers spend 1.2 billion
		dollars each year (1992 figures) on drug tests that 
		are unreliable and inaccurate.  Even hard working
		employees that do not use drugs are at risk.



                                 The Solution:

                       ================================ 


Know the Facts.

        Know what foods and over the counter medicines are routinely 
        mistaken for common illegal drugs.  Simply eating a poppy seed 
        bagel before a drug test can identify you as an opiate user.

        Know how long different illicit drugs can be detected in your 
        system.  Marijuana can be detected for more than a month if 
        nothing is done to conceal its use.

        Know the different types of drug tests, especially the ones
        you are likely to face.  GC/MS tests are almost impossible to 
        beat, but are seldom used.  The more common EMIT test is 
        much easier to fool -- if you know how.

Be Prepared!

        Know when the test is coming.  Do not use illicit drugs, or 
        ingest cross-reactive substances before the test.

        Clean your system of drug metabolites and cross-reactive 
        substances.

        Drink plenty of water and urinate as often as possible before 
        the test.  Do NOT give them your first urine of the day!

Use Clean 'n Clear.


        Clean 'n Clear is a three phase system designed to Clean out 
        your body, so you will give Clear urine and Clear the test.

        The unique Clean 'n Clear Package includes:

             4.  Coloring vitamins to put 'yellow' back in your clear urine

             5.  Information you need about drug testing

             6.  A guarantee!

Hey,

Does anyone know where I can get flyers for Sanctuary on Friday in 
Cleveland, Ohio?  I heard that they had been distributed at the Church 
last Sunday.

Does anyone know?  Also, has anyone heard if this is going to be a good 
party?  The line up seems pretty fine.  Thoughts?

Friday November 17th - ele mental's PERSUASIVE PERCUSSION vol 2 - columbus, OH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

after getting home from work at 5:30pm i discovered my fourth 
attempt for a ride to columbus for Helium had fallen thru it
seemed like everybody and their mother had too much homework
this weekend. finally at 7pm, i sed fuckit i'm stealing my
sister's car & making the trek myself. and a trek it wuz!
what should've been a two and a half hour drive from cleveland
to columbus turned out to be a four hour drive from hell. 
traffic in the snow belt area slowed down to 35mph at times
and several cars were stuck along side the road on our way
down. jinx & i seriously did not believe we were gonna make 
it thru the snow storm. but lo and behold as we entered the
columbus area, the weather got much better and soon we were
home free. unfortunately it wuz 11pm when we got to columbus.
and when we got to the park, the show wuz over =( so in 
reality we missed all of Helium! eventho i've seen Body
Release (titonton+charles noel+todd sines) when they 1st
performed at Smart Bar here in cleveland, i haven't seen 
or heard any of their new stuff, so i wuz a bit bummed. plus
i wuz s'posed to meet my friend mary and jenny at the party.
so here we were in columbus, missed the show, and had two
hours to kill before the after party started. 

we did what any stranded ravah in columbus would do, we hit
the idiot boy & started making phone calls. jinx socialized w/ 
the kids there, he knew the people that were working there,
while i tried finding my friends in columbus. mary wasn't
home. neither wuz jenny. luckily jonathan wuz. so we cruised
over to his pad & chilled w/ him & his roomys & house guests
before we hit the after party.

when we arrived at the after party, we discovered it wuz 
located in what used to be fraternity house. i found it kinda
ironic cuz the first rave in ohio wuz almost held in a frat
house. i know cuz i wuz the one who tried throwing it. it 
turned out the space wuz perfect. just big enuff to house
the 75 or so kids that showed up. later on i met the owner
of the place. he wuz the tall dark dreaded fello that wuz 
dancing madly throughout the night & he explained he lived
in the place w/ several other roommates, but none of them
appreciated techno as much as he did.

a local dj opened up with a short 20 minute jungle set,
which had a slight power failure intermission. mr. ed luna,
got on the tables himself for another short jungle set. ed's
set got a bit funkier near the end. i wuz surprised cuz i 
didn't know ed spun jungle. then charles noel aka monochrome
got on sporting his new dreadless 'do. i think kingsize spun
next. and then titonton with an extra long hard jungle set.
i don't remember too much cuz i wuz busy greetin ole friends
i hadn't seen for awhile: tony, mary, leidra, jenny, walt,
scott, paul, pattie, alroy, dawn, etc, etc.

i wuz really surprised for such a small party, the vibe wuz
thick as hell, everybody wuz dancing! even ole stevie t made
some pathetic attempts to groove to jungle (i'm still find
it difficult to dance to the irradic jungle rhythms).

other highlights of the party: surprise guest dj from chicago,
now residing in columbus and a dj that drove all the way from
toronto. i can't remember their names, but the two of them
have my votes for best set of the night. total crowd control!
and oh yeah the best part: the party wuz free! 

downers: dan curtin wuz a no-show, my respect for this man
keeps dwindling. no drinks, except for good ole tap water,
but the 'aged' cider wuz definitely interesting. jinx's set
wuz way off - he just hasn't been the same after SOUL
GENERATIONS. its kinda hard watching yur friend deterioate
after a failed party & scrounging for money. but getting so
fucked up before u spin is unexcuseable. and i can't believe
i left my backpack at the party!

unexpected after afterparty highlight: i just found out
that jamie aka troutsoup from youngstown who i coincidentally
just met at the party & talked to right before i left, picked
up my bag & will be sending it back to me. needless to say,
i'm sending out a much deserved 'plur' t-shirt to jamie from
y-town! this is what truly keeps my faith in the scene!

---

Saturday November 18 - SHINE - Cleveland, OH
--------------------------------------------

to be honest i wuz a bit suspicous of this party cuz the flyer
listed no dj's, no location, no price. but then my friend monica
called me up & sed it wuz only $5 & wuz in downtown cleveland, so
i sed what the fuk, picked up jinx & headed toward the Flats.

the party wuz located in the Viper Room the new upstairs part of
the Boiler Room this club in the flats. i had never seen the
remodeled upstairs of the club so i wuz pretty impressed.

u walked up the stairs and the first thing u come up to is the 
blacklit bar w/ neon carpet - pretty psychedelic. there wuz 
even a blacklit chill space on the side and pool tables in the
back. i wuz even more impressed when i walked on to the dance
floor. even tho the floor wuz pretty small, the sound wuz thumpin
(altho it kept cutting out several times thru out the night cuz
the dj's kept pumping the levels too high, one even broke the
on-off switch!). also impressive wuz the fact that they had 
Jamie do the lasers and there wuz a widescreen near the back of
the dance floor showing all kinds of trippy fractals & such.

music: too busy socializing to notice. this is what happens 
when i go to parties in my home town - too many friends talking
to u to pay attention to the music. altho i knew all the dj's
that spun, all locals: pulse, gank, sparx, synapse, scorpion,
& jinx. 

highlights: running the table, shooting pool against synapse
& becky. seeing jenny from columbus again (i actually saved
her from going to Ladybug 2, altho terra, ellie, & nick weren't
too happy about it - they wanted to go - good thing they didn't).
having a little dance battle w/ my ole bud brian, unlike the
night before i could keep with the music, so i danced much       
better. chatting w/ all my cleveland rave buddies (don't
worry i won't list'em all).

downers: $3.25 for a Heinikin! watching a friend chuck outside the
club, drugs & food don't mix too well. dropping off everybody
after the party.

props: to Pulse for putting this together & showing small
underground parties not necessarily w/ a big line-up can be
just as fun as the big ones. plus they're a hell of alot 
cheaper & u don't have to drive six hours to get there!

---

anyone go to Mekka in columbus w/ mike huckaby?                    

wonder how dat wuz...

	* professionally mixed down and mastered from DAT

	* full-color j-card w/nifty design work courtesy of myself

	* my first release on the los angeles based BIOHAZARD mixtape label

	:.: get your orders in early...the demand for these is fairly high.
	    i am going to press up another batch of tapes within the next
	    few weeks, in case they sell out in the meanwhile.  i have had
	    nothing but good reviews about this tape since i distributed
	    pre-copies a few weeks back.  a great collection of boomin'
	    007 tunes to cruise around town listening to.  

	:.: the tapes are going for $6US *PLUS* a self-addressed and stamped
	    envelope.  the post office is quite a distance away from where
	    i live, so it is easier for me to just drop your package off in
	    the mailbox.

	:.: send all cash, checks and money orders to : damian higgins

							pittsburgh pa  15206

    =================================================================
      Since I'm going to be home from school this weekend, I decided to check out
    a party close to home. The only problem is that all I have on this one
    (Generic II)  is the info line. That's all I really need, but if anyone knows
    anything else about this (dj line-up, prices, time it starts, etc.) it would
    help me out a lot. 
        Also; has anyone heard anything about a Ladybug refund, or is the
    supposed free party in February supposed to cover it? Well, I guess somehow
    it's all good.

hello.  

i won passes for sanctuary from mike kim's radio show (someone was subbing
for him) on WRUW.  BUT, i noticed the flyer said "Sorry No Guest List." 
so will i get in free or what?  i was told (by the WRUW DJ) that i just have
to go to the door and tell them i'm on the list.  i couldn't get a hold of
anyone at spawntaneous either. any thoughts?   

thanks.

I got to the Agora around 1:30.  This was the first time I went to a rave
there, I wasn't expecting too great of a location.  Actually it was pretty
cool since you could dance on the main stage and lots of lights.  The back
ballroom was a lot bigger than I remembered it to be too.  I got there in
time to hear the end of Tik-Tak's set, good jungle which led nicely into
Soulslinger's set.  Soulslinger had a great set, mixing in some slower
housey stuff with the jungle.  Probably the most people i have seen dance to
jungle in NE Ohio, for quite a while at leat.  Up next was the D. Wynn/ DJ
Bone 4 turntable set (i think dj bone was his name, he's not listed on the
flyer).  I dont usual get into the harder detroit stuff that much, but these
guys were really good.  They started playing more house towards the end of
the set.  i left around 5 and they were still spinning, so i missed Sleepy
C's set.  The back room had some good music too, but I didn't spend too much
time in there - but i did see a little bit each of DJ Jess, Spencer, and
Mike Sparx and they all sounded good.  I never heard Jess or Spencer before,
and they both played some good house.  Only bad thing about the party was
the fairly small turnout, especially for a place as huge as the agora.
Overall it was a good party, especially since it was their first one.

  I got to the American Legion hall in Akron a little before midnight, 
just in time to catch the tail end of my friend Spencer's set. Good 
house, I can't really comment on it much since I hear him spin all the time.
Next up was Lemon-Lyman. He did some crazy shit on the tables. As soon as 
he started spinning a huge crowd was up by the table to watch him. The 
music was pretty good, not really my style, but the mixing was 
incredible. Then around 2:30 or so, the music went off, the lights went 
on, and some guy who I assume in some way managed the building said 
"you're great people, i'd love to have you back again for another party, 
but get out within 10 minutes". They said to go to the coffeehouse, so we 
headed over there and waited about a half hour until they let people in. 
A huge amount of people went in, the coffeehouse was completely packed. 
Then about 10 minutes later 6 or so cop cars came and told everyone to 
get out. They wanted everyone to leave so they could card people on the 
way back in. They cops made everyone wait outside in the freezing 
temperature for 30 minutes, then told everyone to get the hell out and go 
home.
A weird thing happened on our way home. We were going west on 18 in 
akron, and about 10 minutes out from the coffee house there were these 3 
cop cars driving down the road - one was in the right lane, one in the 
middle, and one in the left lane - all headed the same direction and 
flashing strobe lights in front of them. It was almost a roadblock. It 
freaked us out a bit to see 2 cars heading toward us in our lane. My 
friend thinks they were trying to freak us out so we would swerve or 
something and they could pull us over.

SANCTUARY - Gothic Productions - Nov 24, 1995 - Agora Theatre - Cleveland,OH
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lisa, Drew, & I arrived at the site at 12:30am & wuz surprised to see
Scott Lucci inside the ticket booth. turns out Scott Lucci, ex-manager
of Metropolis now Trilogy dance club in the Flats, wuz the promotor
behind Gothic Productions. If I had known this earlier i would have
been less skeptical about the party, because Mr. Lucci is very            
experienced in the party throwing biz. He even helped throw the E.24th
Centrak Partys back in the daze.

The Location

Welp this is about the fifth or sixth party i've been to in the Agora.
The Agora is a legal venue and has hosted the like of several alternative
bands including Nine Inch Nails, Front 242, Jesus & Mary Chain to name
a few. the advantages of a legal venue include: clean furnishings,
two fully stocked bars, several concert seats for weary ravers, clean
bathrooms, adequate & legal parking. the only disadvantage wuz u had
to deal with the agora security guards who checked pretty hard at the
door & roamed the building for obvious dealers. oh yeah one other
disadvantage, which wuzn't too bad this party since it wuz legal, it
wuz advertised on 107.9 WENZ, a commercial alternative radio program,
so there were a few fluffy people there. but at this party there wuz
not a great abundance & they actually seemed very receptive & interested
in this 'all night dance party' that was announced on the radio. Even
with the public advertising there wuz under 500 people there, so crowd
wise it wuzn't too bad - actually it was just about right.

The Setup

Immediately upon entering the main room, you noticed the dj booth was
placed in the middle of the dance floor. with nice sized speaker stacks
in the back and on the sides. kids could either dance around the dj booth
or climb up the stairs and dance on stage. i kinda liked this setup.
the lasers and lights definetely enhanced the effects for the dj's taking
center stage.

The Music

Alex aka Tik Tak wuz spinning a kickin jungle set when we arrived and
really set up things nicely when he handed the controls over
to Soul Slinger the main attraction of the night. The blacklights cast
an eerie glow on his huge yellow liquid sky alien logo as he pumped out
track after track of thumpin jungle. he even mixed in some select 
ambient to give the crowd a breather in between all that mad dancin'
(a rare sight to behold, all those kids dancin' to jungle in cleveland
a primarily hard house / hardcore city). but the dj that really got me
dancing wuz DJ Bone from detroit spinnin all dat detroit hard acid -
yummy! takin charge in the backroom wuz the oberlin duo Spencer & Jesse 
(finally got a picture of the two). both had very respectable House sets.
surprise back room dj wuz Ian Mariano, Church resident, who spun some
good hard trance. unfortunately i wuz unable to catch the later dj's
becuz i had to conduct an interview w/ Chris & Tik Tak of Spawntaneous.
And we had to leave soon after that. this time i didn't mind leaving
early cuz i had to work at nine in the morning.

GENERIC II - AAAA - Nov 25, 1995 - American Legion Hall - Akron, OH
-------------------------------------------------------------------

11:30pm

I call Jenna (Apple Eatin Kitty on NE-Raves) who had just come home
to Madison, Ohio for Thanksgiving Break and asked her what she wuz 
doing that night. she wuzn't planning on anything so i invited her to
go to Generic II with me.

1:00am

After running a few errands i finally arrived at Jenna's house in 
madison (quite a trek from cleveland heights). i wuz really excited
cuz i've talked alot w/ Jenna on NE-Raves, but i've never met her 
altho we shared some old friends. Jenna came out & wuz the cutest
'lil thing, she gave me a big ole hug. she introduced me to her
parents, who gave me the typical 20 question thing. "uhh, we're
gonna visit some old friends in akron..when will we be back?..uhhh,
when the party's over i guess...uhm nice meeting u mam...uhh we 
gotta go cuz we're late." Jenna wuz so nice, she had brought me
back a 'lil gift: this cheesy Philadelphia Cheesesteak T-shirt! 
So of course i had to give her a gift too. i gave her a shirt too,
the 'PLUR' T-shirt i designed.

2:00am

We arrive at the American Legion Hall in Akron, OH. i wuz lucky,
Jill wuz workin' the door & she let me & Jenna in for free cuz
she knew i helped promo the party. but it wuz a good thing we 
didn't hafta pay cuz we definitely would not have gotten our
money's worth if we had. immediately upon entering we were greeted
by X-On & his Pitt buddies. after introducing Jenna to him, i
introduced her to a whole slew of the new skool of ohio ravahs.
i think the only ohio ravah she met from the past wuz jimmy, who
helped start the akron scene.

since we got there so late we missed most of the dj's. altho i do
know yopu didn't spin at all becuz he didn't know he wuz opening.
most of the local dj's that were billed didn't spin at all becuz
there wuz no second room. there wuz a back chill room where
Earthtones basically played ambient cd's, but there wuz no second
room for the local dj's to spin. spinning on the main floor when
we got to the party wuz J.Keesan from Soul Flower, Colorado. gotta
give him props for the short hour he spun he had a killer set, got
tons o kids on the dance floor! that's the other thing that i wuz
upset about. the fact that me & jenna didn't get to dance at all
when the party wuz shut down at...

3:00am

the owners of the space, the same anal owners that shut down the
party early when AAAA threw their last party at the same spot, 
decided that they were tired & made them close the party early.
Matt even offered to them extra, but they were still pricks. so
all the kids herded out & started caravaning toward the Esquigamalogical
Coffee Shop where the Afterhours wuz to be held anyways. unfortunately,
the Akron Police noticed all these kids following each other, so
they followed too.

3:15am

Finally after all the kids got into the packed coffee shop, the 
cops announced that everybody had to get out so they could card
everybody. Jenna didn't have her ID on her so i told her to hide
out in the back. she wuz lucky, cuz she didn't hafta stand out
in the cold for fifteen minutes only to have the cops make everybody
go him anyways. apparently, the cops found they didn't have all
the permits plus a few ravers were being pretty rude, so they
made everybody go home. even when Brian of U.P.S. tried to peace-    
fully talk them, they were being total pricks!

this wuz the 1st party that AAAA has thrown, that ended so
miserably. atleast when they threw MIRACLES, they kept the party
going by moving it to a virgin warehouse space & continued it
total renegade style. they tried moving the party to a different
location w/ this party, but too many cops followed that caravan
of cars after the party got shut down early. iow akron cops suk!

i think the only upside about this party wuz hanging out w/ jenna
& comparing our alien philosophies. we both agreed after hearing
some racial comments at an all night diner after the party that
if the human race still has problems with racism, than how can
humans possibly be ready for the aliens when people can't even get
past the color of one's skin. we're not ready yet for them.

--- 

anyone go to the Church on sunday, kinda bummed cuz i wuz guest
listed but couldn't find a ride again (sharing a car sux!). anyone
who wants to go to the Church for free & has wheels, e me!

i've really gotta retire already!

SORRY FOR THE MASSIVE , MASSIVE CROSSPOST, BUT SPAMMING FOR MAX GLOBAL
REACH...............

Re: a recent thread regarding desire for a centralized internet resource
detailing music stores that carry IDM, techno, ambient, trance, jungle,
etc.; i am beginning to compile said resource.  It will be located at
hyperreal and will be a geographically organized table of your inputs.
Following are the fields i intend to include:

NAME:
LOCATION: City, State, Country
ADDRESS:  Street Address
PHONE:
INTERNET ADDRESS:  email and / or WWW URL, if available
CD SELECTTION RATING: subjective 1 (K-Mart / Wal-Mart) to 10 (That Dream
Store That You Could Spend Hours In)
VINYL SELECTION RATING:  same scale
OTHER STUFF SELECTION RATING:  clothes , DJ gear, books / mags etc. (1 -
10)
PRE-LISTENING?: Y/N
USED MUSIC?: Y/N
MAIL ORDER?: Y/N
PRICING?: In general: cheap, average, expensive
COMMENTS:  any other comments you wish to add re: selection,
pre-ordering, special services, etc.
YOUR EMAIL:
YOUR HOMEPAGE:

If you'd like to contribute (and i hope you will, because the more the
merrier), please use the following form, cutting and pasting as many
times as needed, and replying via
     EMAIL TO ME, NOT THE LIST!!!!!!!.

include "ROTATOR LOCATOR" in your subject line.

------------------------snip-------------------------------------

It is my intent to include as many entries as possible, although
avoiding the "majors" (tower, best buy, etc.) unless in your opinion
they have a relatively good selection or are the best / only source in
your locale.

It will probably take me several weeks to get the first edition up, as
i'm traveling abroad right now, but hopefully we'll have the start of
yet another useful resource at hyperreal if enough of you contribute.

wow, that's cool...but i hope you know the party's in columbus ohio!
about a 4.5 hour drive...anyway i'll assume you do :)

here ya go:

im not sure where penn st is, you say state college so i'll try to give 
you directions from there...take st rt 322 WEST for a few miles to st rt 220
SOUTH.  stay on 220 for about 70 miles till you hit I-76/I-70 which both
run together for a while.  go WEST.  once on 70 W stay on it in PA for about 
1.5 hours, till you enter ohio, and once inside ohio you'll drive about 2 
more hours (still on 70 W) till you see downtown columbus and stuff.  get 
off at exit 100, then take a RIGHT at the 1st light.  that's N 4TH ST.  
go up n 4th st about...um (counting) 6 or 7 lights, look for the biggest 
street, called BROAD, then take a RIGHT.  about 3 or 4 lights down from 
that look for GRANT, then take a LEFT.  GAY is the next street up from 
that, and the space is right there...the only building at that 
intersection of gay and grant.  parking all around...

well, if you do make it, look for me!  i'll probably be in my performance 
getup: jumpsuit and safety goggles.  we can probably find someone to give 
you crash space as well, if need be...

Sorry, I should have forwarded these posts to the lists when I posted to
NE Raves.  I will not repeat the mistake again.  :)

Subject: NR: CyberTribe and Site

As a way for people to keep track of posts on the Net Rave party I am 
going to try to keep with the convention of posting NR: at the beginning 
of the subject line so you know what the post is about.  If you feel like 
doing the same I think it may prevent some confusion.

I knew that I would be hearing the echoes of CyberTribe when I started
planning this party.  The first four letters I received in response to my
initial post metioned it so I thought I would confront it right away. 
This party is no CyberTribe.  I have been involved with the scene for a
long time, helped throw parties, promoted, worked on undergrounds, etc.  I
have a strong network of support to help out with the party and I will be
relying on folks to help.  If there is a problem I will bring it up on
here.  If you need to get in touch with me about the party here's my home
number: 301-441-9328, you can always (at least) leave a message for me
there.  My work number is 301-231-0191, please use it sparingly.

I have found a stable site to use.  I am sure at least a few people are
familiar with the Raza space in Baltimore.  I have spoken with Lonnie and
it's ours to use.  Now please understand this, Lonnie is doing a big
favor.  The roomates aren't letting the space out to third parties
anymore, we are getting it only because he really likes what he has seen
from you folks involved on here. 

Price of the party right now is going to be between $5 and $7, depending
on how many people plan on attending.  I wish I could make it free, but
there is overhead such as sound system, rental and DJ travel expenses. 
There is no date set yet.  I am looking at late January and early February
but I want to call around and see what parties other folks are planning.

Here's a couple of questions:

Friday or Saturday night?
What DJs do you want to see there?
What dates are best for you?
Ack!  We need a name!  :)  Got it?

Two topics that need taking care of immediately are who is going to DJ and
how we are going to get people down here. 

First, DJs.  If you are interested in donating your time to the net meet,
please email me with your DJ name and contact information.  I need a phone
number, location (snail mail addy) and email address to make sure that
what needs doing gets done on time.  Remember, travel expenses are a part 
of the bargain.

I am requesting that you send tapes as soon as possible.  I know I have
heard alot of you spin before, but I haven't heard everyone in the last
few months so I need to be able to start making informed selections as
soon as possible.  Please be aware that ability, style of music,
availability and where you are coming from are all factors in the
decision.  I don't want to make the night 'all house', 'all jungle', 'all
hardcore' or any other 'all'.  Variety and the flow of the music through
the night is key. 

Send the tapes to:

Dan Philpott
8015 Mandan Rd., #102
Greenbelt, MD 20770

Yep, that's right, I have a last name.  ;)

Second, travel.  We need volunteers to help put together van rides.  It
might sound a little intimidating, but renting a van, car or U-Haul for a
trip is very easy.  The basics you need is someone over 21 (best if over
25) with a credit card (can be a passenger), a piece of paper to keep
track of who needs a ride and some time.  I am going to put together a
mini-FAQ with a friend to walk through the process if you want to help but
haven't done it before.  But for now we need some organized and DEPENDABLE
people who can follow through on putting together the trips.

Okay, that's enough for now.  If you email me and I don't get back to you
immediately please be patient. 

Dan

Folks, it looks like we might be able to install a second room after 
all.  :)  Lonnie emailed me and said that they have had successful second 
rooms at the site.  There might be some sonic bleed from the main room 
but not enough to make it unfeasible.

So what we are going to need are people with sound equipment who can 
bring along stuff early in the evening to set it up.  The budget right 
now won't stand rental of a full new sound system, but I know a good 
number of people who can donate enough sound equipment to make it work.

What I am thinking is we can have a second sound room are two ideas, or
both split into two sessions: 

Sign up sheet.  You come in, sign up for the 30-45 minute set and then go
for it. 

Ambient Room.  We set it up all before hand and give it over to the 
Ambient and IDM people to make the evening happen for us.

Okay, here is a quick and dirty list of suggested names and who suggested 
them.  If you don't like the names just email out with your suggestions 
and we can play around for a while before making the decision.  And 
please, email the list so we can talk about this.  I am getting alot of 
personal mail right now but would really like to make the party more of a 
publicly discussed subject.  :)

Names:

Beat NIC 		- danFREELove
Kamhlaba 		- danFREELove ('Small World' in SiSwati, also 
			part of the name of my old United World College).
Bishinik		- danFREELove ('Communication' in a Native 
			American language).
Travellers		- danFREELove
Reed, Zane or Ry	- danFREELove (my nephews first names)
Internet		- Eric Hansen
Internaut		- Denise Locthenbergh
Cyber-rave		- Wilson Miles
Bubble			- Alan Parry (Fluid)
Boogie Woogie		- Alan Parry (Fluid)
Anyone			- Alan Parry (Fluid) (play on: NE-1)
raDiANCE		- Jammin' James E.
NEt RAVE		- Karin Sedestrom

Also, just for informations sake.  We currently have 27 DJs who have
either volunteered or inquired about playing for the party.  I don't want
to post the list just yet, but eventually we can play around with it. 
There are a few DJs who are suggested again and again and I will be
contacting many DJs through private mail to let them know about the party. 
The lineup still depends on the recommendations the folks who get together
to go over the submissions.  On that note I would like to ask that
DC/Balt. area people (or folks willing to travel) let on if they are
interested in spending a Saturday or Sunday reviewing.

Sorry to crosspost this but all the mail sent to me before November 29 
got deleted so if anyone mailed me and I didn't respond please resend 
anything you may have sent. I am looking on getting a better account 
where I can check my mail a bit more often (before the sysadmin deletes 
the 100's of messages that pile up). But until then please bear with me.
Oh yeah I still need a ride to Renegades if anyone is leaving from the 
Pittsburgh or Cleveland area for this party I'd very much like to go.

welp since JJ & others have asked for a deadline date...

ok, i guess it's that time of month to do another PLRM.
ok, i think this might be the last ish, cuz i really gotta
retire & finish that last semester of college. then maybe
i'll restart it up again, i dunno.

to tell u the truth, it's been quite a journey (five
years in the making - yah i've been in the scene for
quite some time, which is why i gotta retire) from
being a hardcwoh ravah since the birth of the scene,
to helping start a scene in my part of the woods, to
starting an organization, to starting a magazine &
watching it grow and watching it spread to as far 
north as montreal canada, as far south as tallahasse
florida, as far west as larkspur california, and as
far east as long island new york. i still don't know
how it all happened, feels kinda like a Forrest Gump
movie, feels kinda predestined. but i do wanna thank

hannibal sed:
==================================================================
Regarding Stevie's post about naming the ne-raves party "PLUR"

it's a damn good idea, but it was done before... here, in Boston, last 
year... Also used (following up the first party in the trilogy) were: 
"PLURAL" and "PLURALISM"...

sorry.

-colby
================================================================== 

yah, i remember jimmy & sprocket's PLUR endeavors, but i thought
i'd still recognize john's suggestion, since it was neglected.  

funny how names seem to reoccur. take for example RUMBLE in
cleveland, than RUMBLE again in NYC, PLUR in san fran & PLUR
in boston, Orbit Records in LA & orbitrecords in pittsburgh,
ele mental in columbus & Ele Mental the party in chicago,
NUTCRACKER in cleveland on the 29th of this month & NUTCRACKER
on the 23rd of this month in chicago, colby in pittsburgh,
colby in philly (hi jenna =]), hannibal the guy we know & luv
on ne-raves, hannibal the guy that eats people on SILENCE OF
THE LAMBS, etc, etc.

if u wanna make it original, how about: PLUR'96
(so we can make it an annual thing, so we can have one every year!)

or here's a cheesy suggestion: LURP!
(it's PLUR scrambled, beginning with love. i always thought it
should've started with love anyways. cuz only with love can there
be unity. and thru unity, mutual respect can be gained. and when
mutual respect is gained on a global level, then and only then
can there be world peace. plus it sounds like something u'd say
when u've eaten too much PLUR!)

welp dats my 2 scents...back into lurker mode...
