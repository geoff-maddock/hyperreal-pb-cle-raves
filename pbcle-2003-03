Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a 10 message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will not forward
them to the list.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} One Love Review

Sorry this is so late, I'm finally getting around to it :)

First of all, I needed my "disco nap" so I didn't get there until 1:00am.  I
caught the tail end of Feelgood's set which was bumpin' then started running
into people.  How appropriate that the first person I saw was Luke -- damn
good to see you out man (if you are still lurking here).  Followed by Meghan
& Chris, Otagi, Nox, Jes, and then many others.

The weather was ABSOLUTELY horrible, but it was good to see many old and new
friends out at this event.  They had 800+ people, but needed a couple
hundred more to break even.  In any case, I am so happy that Brandon and
Josh (wishingwell and groovefuel) decided to throw this event in Cleveland.
I find it completely sad that there were more people who drove 3-8 hours to
get there than there were people who only had travel less than an hour.  I
guess that says something, but I know many were supporting the rest of the
local scene at CMF and that was just as important!  I do know quite a few
who went to both though and that also says something :)

Anyways, I caught Feelgood (who put me in the right frame of mind!)  Then I
went upstaris and Odi was tearing it up - and if I had not had an agenda I
would have stayed there for the rest of his set.  So I intended to catch all
of Mark Mayhem's set, and even though it was trance (j/k) he tore it up.
Seriously, Mark was sweet.  I also got to catch the tale end of Anita
DeCastro -- and she lived up to all the hype and then some.  I caught about
5 mintues of dj rap, whatever.   Jackal's live set sounded sweet but I
wanted to go back downstairs and socialize with friends and get ready for my
set.

After a slight mixup (in my mind) about my timeslot (5.30 am not 5.00 am), I
had one of the best times playing records that I have ever had.  In fact, I
appreciate everyone who stuck around until the end (even for a house set ;).
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  Reed... I don't know if your up on this list or not...
but thanks for clarifying the "Doug not Dave" thing with everyone. I wish I
would have stayed out in Lorain for the afterhours -- I heard about some
Harry Potter pizza party that sounded fun.

All said and done, however, I look back and realize that the party "One
Love" was aptly named.  This was one of those rare times when you are
reminded why you love this scene. I know I felt it and I'm pretty sure
everyone else did too.   It just goes to show what quality production
(sound), and quality music can do for an event that people will remember.
(Plus an icestorm that chased away the poseurs helped too).

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


yeah well i don't go out much anymore, the most i've done is represented groove and zythos for past year or so.  so i went to my friends art show this past weekend in fredricks maryland which was great.  to top the night off however was finding out mark firina was in DC.  We ment some cool cats at the art show that where promoters i forget who for though.  some kevin character i think, also a mushroom jazz type of guy.  so we got to party like true rock start groupies, even walk on the red carpet haha, yeah but mark's set was  the best i have ever heard!!!!  DC and baltimore defenitly has the spot and people for the dj's to vibe with.  it's depressing to come back to pgh or surrounding spots and not feel that energy.  i guess it's to be expected i just miss the days where headliners where flowing regularly and the crowds where spectacular.  blah, peace out kids, this young man is  out for the count

Subject: {pb-cle} V Day Groove

Yo-

Anyone go to Groove's Valentine's Day nite? I was there, but only til 1:30...

That nite somethin inside of me snapped, and maybe similar to others on this list, I had a small epiphany that this just wasnt me anymore... 

I seen Celeste, Craig, and Tim Z.  Nice to say hi and all.

On a brighter note, I heard Josh the Funky 1 was good.  I hear One Love was a good time too.  Maybe its not dead yet.

For me it is tho.  Still love techno, and dancing... but not raving.

Chris

Actually if you wanna know the owner of the venue is the one who invited 
girls gone wild.  In return for him doing it we got booted out of the main 
room and placed upstairs. So in response to your post its not like I 
intentionaly planned this out, I'm just trying to make the best out of it.

Youre very right my bad.

My dissent was necessarily directed at you man.  Frankly, I was surprised as

Dear friend,

I'm hoping you can join me on an emergency petition from 
citizens around the world to the U.N. Security Council.  The
petition's going to be delivered to the 15 member states of
the Security Council on THURSDAY, MARCH 6.

If hundreds of thousands of us sign, it could be an enormously
important and powerful message -- people from all over the
world joining in a single call for a peaceful solution.  But
we really need everyone who agrees to sign up today.  You can 
do so easily and quickly at:

   http://www.moveon.org/emergency/

The stakes couldn't really be much higher.   A war with Iraq
could kill tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and inflame
the Middle East.  According to current plans, it would require
an American occupation of the country for years to come.  And
it could escalate in ways that are horrifying to imagine.

We can stop this tragedy from unfolding.  But we need to speak
together, and we need to do so now.  Let's show the Security
Council what world citizens think.

Thank you,
------=_NextPart_000_0030_01C2E287.C87B47A0--

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Please sign emergency petition to the U.N.

And should someone fail to take action, hundreds of Iraqi's will die of 
starvation. Why will they die of starvation? Because of the 
continuation of sanctions placed upon Iraq because of their failure to 
comply with UN mandates. If I had had the choice, I'd rather have a 
bomb dropped on my house than watch my family die of starvation.

This isn't black and white, and quite frankly, I'm sick of the world 
looking at it this way. There are two reasons the rest of the world 
hates us now, and it has nothing to do with Iraq, and everything to do 
with our current attitude on foreign policy.

Isn't that little girl from Dune creepy?

hey, dont forget the fact that plenty of people in THIS country
are starving and cant get jobs, and the government is telling them
(in even greater numbers now under bush) to go get fucked while we
spend hundreds of billions of dollars on war shit. 

i think its absolutely hilarious that EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE CRIME
THAT ANY OTHER COUNTRY HAS COMMITTED WE HAVE DONE HERE AND LIKELY
DONE IT BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

saddam killed his people - we killed all the indians, and the
blacks, etc.

hitler put the jews in concentration camps - we put the japanese
in concentration camps

hitler killed all the jews - we killed all the indians

shit, you name it, we've done it. its ridiculous. i read this
really great piece the other day (that i cant find the fucking
link for!!!!!!!!!!) by carl oglesby from when we were in vietnam,
and basically he compares the vietnamese revolution to the
american revolution, and damn near every element was present in
both, yet we felt the need to kill the vietnamese for trying to
have a revolution. ha. carl oglesby is great though, im actually
reading this book by him about containment of the communists
during the cold war (this was also published around the time of
the vietnam war) and basically he talks about how the vietnamese
revolution was occuring everywhere in the country, and how the
arbitrary north-south divide was completely fabricated in an
effort by our country to contain communist states with a buffer
zone of non-communist contries. somehow, i see very similar things
happening in iraq, which is the only secular arabic government. we
pick on them despite the fact that other countries in the middle
east do the same shit saddam does, but he doesnt use god as his
reasoning. bahhhhhh.

Saddam is unrelated to the 9-11 tragedy in any way, shape, form, or 
conceivable notion. You're the sucker that the Bush administration is trying 
to appeal to. I think you're covering your eyes with that flag you're waving 
so fervently.


>Drop the bomb and wipe them all out and then you will have peace and >love

Read that sentence again. Cognitive dissonance comes to my mind. "If I smash 
this guy in the face, then there will be peace." I have come to agree that 
U.S. aggression is an eventuality, but why is it that the ardent supporters 
of the Bush regime come across as so ignorant?

You'll probably threaten to kick my ass now. Maybe you should, because a 
good ole Texas style ass whoopin definitely promotes peace. Why am I 
bothering, I am sure you're one of THOSE guys who doesn't listen to other 
peoples comments. You just wait for a lull in the conversation so you can 
spout off your ill conceived notions some more.

Eat poop.

Did the citizens of Iraq fly into the World Trade Center?

And where *is* Osama, anyway?

And didn't we kill over 30,000 Taliban soldiers in retaliation last
fall?

Ok, I'm going out on a limb here, but I think for once in reading all of your numerous post, most in which you come off as a discriminating, pompous ass, I can actually agree with you on this one.  The American government, and a lot of the people, are some of the biggest hypocrites in the world and the worst part of it is that we have no problem showing it off, or as some like to put it "throwing our weight around".  We are a free nation, free to do what they say and what is convinient for their interests.
 
Bravo,
Marisa

hey, dont forget the fact that plenty of people in THIS country
are starving and cant get jobs, and the government is telling them
(in even greater numbers now under bush) to go get fucked while we
spend hundreds of billions of dollars on war shit. 

i think its absolutely hilarious that EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE CRIME
THAT ANY OTHER COUNTRY HAS COMMITTED WE HAVE DONE HERE AND LIKELY
DONE IT BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

saddam killed his people - we killed all the indians, and the
blacks, etc.

hitler put the jews in concentration camps - we put the japanese
in concentration camps

hitler killed all the jews - we killed all the indians

shit, you name it, we've done it. its ridiculous. i read this
really great piece the other day (that i cant find the fucking
link for!!!!!!!!!!) by carl oglesby from when we were in vietnam,
and basically he compares the vietnamese revolution to the
american revolution, and damn near every element was present in
both, yet we felt the need to kill the vietnamese for trying to
have a revolution. ha. carl oglesby is great though, im actually
reading this book by him about containment of the communists
during the cold war (this was also published around the time of
the vietnam war) and basically he talks about how the vietnamese
revolution was occuring everywhere in the country, and how the
arbitrary north-south divide was completely fabricated in an
effort by our country to contain communist states with a buffer
zone of non-communist contries. somehow, i see very similar things
happening in iraq, which is the only secular arabic government. we
pick on them despite the fact that other countries in the middle
east do the same shit saddam does, but he doesnt use god as his
reasoning. bahhhhhh.

But you have to admit, you gotta kinda in a backhand way admire them for being able to pull that
off....

Then again, our government continually hands out shit sandwiches and most Americans get on up and do
the Patriotic Red White & Blue Boogaloo every chance they get....flag window stickers, hating people
from other countries, etc.

Why do we care about Sadaam?? He's a 2nd rate dictator at best...the only thing he really has going
for him is that his basement is full of black gold...

The fact of the matter is that big business has our leaders by their sacs, and THEY ARE STILL
DEPENDENT ON OIL.

(at the risk of sounding a bit like everyone's favorite asian schizophrenic...)

If this country were as great as it professes to be, it sure as HELL wouldn't be professing to the
world its dependence on oil. It would be taking the light years of scientific advancements we have
over EVERYONE, putting them to use in implementing alternative feuling solutions, and holding up a
big fat middle finger to the Middle East right before we turn the entire area into the world's
largest deposit of natural glass.

Oh fuck that.  I love it how we're the bad guys in that particular
situation.  Saddaam violates the treaty signed after we kicked his ass,
so we sanction him.  Instead of feeding his people with what is given,
he builds himself new palaces and statues and what not.  And yet they
continue to support him.  And we're the bad guys, because they expect a
handout.

Fuck that, get a job Iraq.

Same shit going on in N. Korea.  Kim Jong Il keeps his million-man army
well fed and well stocked, but the rest of his people go hungry, and
hate us for it.  Eat my ass.

There's actually some history involved in and around that, but I don't
see a searchable feature on the list archive, so I don't think I'll be
able to find the original email that refers to. Just a way of me saying
hello and that I'm here to some folks. :) Look back for something

At the risk of sounding like a total righty (which I am not, I an
Emperor of my own Nation), I think it's more important to see where in
the world the old USA is NOT acting right now, and that explains
SOOOOOOO much more about the current situation in the middle east.

Isn't there an off-topic list for this sort of thread?

But you have to admit, you gotta kinda in a backhand way admire them for
being able to pull that off....

Then again, our government continually hands out shit sandwiches and
most Americans get on up and do the Patriotic Red White & Blue Boogaloo
every chance they get....flag window stickers, hating people from other
countries, etc.

Why do we care about Sadaam?? He's a 2nd rate dictator at best...the
only thing he really has going for him is that his basement is full of
black gold...

The fact of the matter is that big business has our leaders by their
sacs, and THEY ARE STILL DEPENDENT ON OIL.

(at the risk of sounding a bit like everyone's favorite asian
schizophrenic...)

If this country were as great as it professes to be, it sure as HELL
wouldn't be professing to the world its dependence on oil. It would be
taking the light years of scientific advancements we have over EVERYONE,
putting them to use in implementing alternative feuling solutions, and
holding up a big fat middle finger to the Middle East right before we
turn the entire area into the world's largest deposit of natural glass.

So Saddam Hussein didn't let offer asylum to Al Quaida operatives in Iraq after we bombed Afghanistan?
He also doesn't give money to terrosist groups for the purpose of plots such as 9/11?
He hasn't been involved in direct plots to assasinate top US (and world) officials?
He may not have directly been involved with 9/11, but don't kid yourself, he is a terrorist.. To us, to people in his own country and to the Middle East in general.. Even Momar Kedafi agrees he's gotta go..
My feelings are mixed on the war, and the way the US is handling this..I think we should avoid war, if we can BUT, don't support Saddam by saying he had nothing to do with 9/11...
Just my two cents..

Saddam is unrelated to the 9-11 tragedy in any way, shape, form, or 
conceivable notion. You're the sucker that the Bush administration is trying 
to appeal to. I think you're covering your eyes with that flag you're waving 
so fervently.


>Drop the bomb and wipe them all out and then you will have peace and >love

Read that sentence again. Cognitive dissonance comes to my mind. "If I smash 
this guy in the face, then there will be peace." I have come to agree that 
U.S. aggression is an eventuality, but why is it that the ardent supporters 
of the Bush regime come across as so ignorant?

You'll probably threaten to kick my ass now. Maybe you should, because a 
good ole Texas style ass whoopin definitely promotes peace. Why am I 
bothering, I am sure you're one of THOSE guys who doesn't listen to other 
peoples comments. You just wait for a lull in the conversation so you can 
spout off your ill conceived notions some more.

Eat poop.

whats really hilarious, and its totally sad that our country let
bush43 get away with it, is that a great number of bush's
cabinet's undersecretaries and whatnot are former iran/contra
fuckfaces who have already been convicted of corrupt as hell
government practices (that we're still paying for in LOTS of ways,
since so many people still hate usin the middle east) but were
pardoned by bush41 and now are back with little fanfare. id like

>So Saddam Hussein didn't let offer asylum to Al Quaida operatives
in Iraq after we bombed Afghanistan?
>He also doesn't give money to terrosist groups for the purpose of
plots such as 9/11?

where is your proof for this? i especially object ot the "plots
such as 9/11" thing, since there has only been one other terrorist
attack on american soil by someone not an american, and that was
the 93 bombing of the WTC that saddam also had nothing to do with.
if you want to talk about him supporting hamas, thats a different
story altogether. however, if you are talking about him supporting
hamas, you have to discuss our supporting of any killing done by
israel. 

>He hasn't been involved in direct plots to assasinate top US (and
world) officials?

we've done the same: trying to kill quaddafi, castro, etc. should
some more righteous country come and bomb us and give us a regime
change?

>He may not have directly been involved with 9/11, but don't kid
yourself, he is a terrorist.. To us, to people in his own country
and to the Middle East in general..

our government is more of a terrorist to us, the people in iraq,
and the people in the middle east in general without question. how
many people did we kill in iraq in 1991? how much fighting has
occured because of our support in putting israel right in the
middle of some land that many other people wanted? how many
americans has saddam actually killed? zero. 

>Even Momar Kedafi agrees he's gotta go..

please, even bringing up something like that is just simply
ridiculous. 

>My feelings are mixed on the war, and the way the US is handling
this..I think we should avoid war, if we can BUT, don't support
Saddam by saying he had nothing to do with 9/11...

it has nothing to do with supporting saddam. there are plenty of
cocksuckers running countries out there, and there is even at
least one country in the middle east that we actually KNOW had
something major to do with 9-11 and we're not doing anything to
them: saudi arabia. 

obviously you dont know about the numerous papers written by
cheney, rove, etc starting in 1992 and again during the clinton
administration reporting that we should have a regime change in
iraq. our current administration is filled with all the people who
wrote about this for the last decade, and theyre just using 9-11
as an excuse to play stupid american people like a harp to get
their own personal agendas fulfilled. 

>Just my two cents..

id say it was worth less than that

ive come to realise that the "war on terrorism" is the same as the cold
war...its an excuse for the administration to spend tons of money on the
military-industrial complex...all they have to do is scare enough people
into believing that somebody is gonna start shit...case in point n.
korea...all this stuff is going down so bush can drop a trillion into
northrop(which he and most of his buddies own considerable stock in)to build
a missle defense system...funny how we decided in the 80s that a missle
defense system was worthless...and this was when we actually had to worry
about someone tossing an icbm at us...now we have a 4th rate communist
country...with a couple of short range missles...now all of a sudden they
can hit the west coast of america? hahaha...seriously...i guess you really
can fool most of the people all of the time...

OK, I will concede to what you are saying. It is entirely unreasonable for 
me to say there can be no connection made between terrorism and Iraq. I am 
not saying that I support Saddam, nor even that I totally oppose a U.S. 
invasion. I do however still strongly feel that equating anti-war mentality, 
with a lack of compassion for the victims of 9/11, as a totally ridiculous 
claim. That is why I got out of hand with my initial comments.

So Saddam Hussein didn't let offer asylum to Al Quaida operatives in Iraq 
after we bombed Afghanistan?
He also doesn't give money to terrosist groups for the purpose of plots such 
as 9/11?
He hasn't been involved in direct plots to assasinate top US (and world)

He may not have directly been involved with 9/11, but don't kid yourself, he

Saddam is unrelated to the 9-11 tragedy in any way, shape, form, or
conceivable notion. You're the sucker that the Bush administration is trying
to appeal to. I think you're covering your eyes with that flag you're waving
so fervently.


 >Drop the bomb and wipe them all out and then you will have peace and >love

Read that sentence again. Cognitive dissonance comes to my mind. "If I smash
this guy in the face, then there will be peace." I have come to agree that
U.S. aggression is an eventuality, but why is it that the ardent supporters
of the Bush regime come across as so ignorant?

You'll probably threaten to kick my ass now. Maybe you should, because a
good ole Texas style ass whoopin definitely promotes peace. Why am I
bothering, I am sure you're one of THOSE guys who doesn't listen to other
peoples comments. You just wait for a lull in the conversation so you can
spout off your ill conceived notions some more.

Eat poop.

He actually believed it was possible for the previous few? This guy has
bigger issues than is obvious.

"What if [Saddam] fails to comply and we fail to act, or we take some
ambiguous third route, which gives him yet more opportunities to develop
this program of weapons of mass destruction? ... Well, he will conclude
that the international community has lost its will. He will then conclude
that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating
destruction. And some day, some way, I guarantee you he'll use the
arsenal."

security targets in Iraq. They are joined by British forces. Their mission
is to attack Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programmes and
its military capacity to threaten its neighbours."

"Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbours or the world
with nuclear arms, poison gas or biological weapons."

There's lots more of these, and they all have one thing in common: they
were spoken by a president whose last name is not "Bush".

What was someone saying about how this whole thing isn't nearly black and
white? Ayup.

something else worth pointing out...most if not all of the 9/11 hijackers
were saudi's...SAUDI'S!!! why arent we bombing the shit out of saudi
arabia...oh yeah...i remember now..they are good little lap dogs and sell us
oil

wake up people...you are being used

one more point...dont you think we couldve taken care of saddam a long time
ago?  the bush administration needs saddam...without them they dont have a
good villian that they can kick around easily with little chance for
terrible repercussions.

No, there are clearly differences: for one thing, one of them wasn't just
doing it to distract from his own impeachment vote. 

Either way, killing innocent people is killing innocent people. Making
exceptions or special rules because the person doing it is of your party
is brain dead.

And in 1999. How is that hippieland Kosovo doing these days anyway?

I'm against this war myself. But anyone who thinks that we had PLUR up
until 2001 is living in a partisan fog. There was a president recently who
set the record for attacking the most countries in peactime in his
presidency. His last name also wasn't "Bush". The system's been screwed up
far beyond repair for a long, long time. Many people are just now finally
seeing it.

Bob, I'm gonna have to completely disagree with this statement.  If you are
a citizen of a country that is at war, you are not an 'innocent'.  You
choose to be a citizen of your country therefore you waive your right to
being an impartial party.  If you are an american and somehow there is a
terrorist strike on our country and you die, you were not innocent, you are
just a casualty of your own country's device.  This also goes for those in
other countries that identify themselves as whatever nationality they may be
from, and in identification i mean they choose to live in the country.
There are no innocent people that become casualties of war, there are just
casualties of war, unless you are talking about media figures from other
countries that are covering the war, and even then, they chose to risk their
lives for their profession, so they're not innocent as well.

I remembered the first time I heard that if you move to another country
you still have to pay income tax to U.S.  That is some seriously messed up
stuff.  Only way you don't pay income tax is if you litterally forfeit
your citizenship and go to some other country.  You can't give up your
citizenship and still live here, they'll deport your behind.  Although I
wonder where they would deport you if are no longer a U.S. citizen, but
you're not a citizen somewhere else either.  They just dump you in
international waters :)

Subject: {pb-cle} WORQ IT on Friday & PSYNTHESIS on Saturday

Is anyone going to WORQ IT down in Dayton to see DJ Dan and Paul Birken or 
PSYNTHESIS in Pittsburgh for Dan's all goa/psytrance party?  I will be 
attending both.  I'm going to be soooooooooooo pooped by the end of this 
weekend.  I've never partied two nights in a row like this, so this will 
definitely be an experience.  Luckily I've reserved a hotel for after 
Psynthesis.  If I get around to it, I will try to post reviews for both.

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Sat Mar 08                      CARPE NOCTEM                         Toledo

Black Sun Entertainment Presents:
Carpe Noctem - Seize the Night
March 8th 2003
Toledo, OH

Featuring

Dj Dara - NYC, NY - DnB - BreakBeatScience, PlanetOfTheDrums, Am Only

As a result from both his successful DJing and recording endeavors, Dara 
has become one of the most recognizable faces on the US drum 'n' bass 
scene. He has been featured in countless magazine appearances and 
interviews both in the US and worldwide. He can be found making his annual 
appearance at the legendary Notting Hill Carnival along with raves and 
clubs all across the US. For some time Dara was also the host of a weekly 
web-TV show Velocity on which he has interviewed some of the leading names 
in drum 'n' bass, including Jonny L, Kemistry and Storm, Trace, Ed Rush 
and Optical, Hype, Andy C, Zinc, SS and many others.

Dara is currently working on single releases for his own imprint, 
Breakbeat Science Recordings, including the upcoming BBSCI003 release 
"Possession / Duplicity (Klute Rmx)" which is being caned on plate at the 
moment. In 2000, Dara completed "From Here To There", a new mixed CD on 
Moonshine that features some amazing tracks. These include Dara's own 
"Duplicity" (Klute Remix), as well as set opener "Crazy" by L Double & 
Serena, DJ Hype's "The Big 3-Oh," two tracks from John B ("Prowler" and 
"Progress"), Kenny Ken's "Project One" and numerous other top tracks.

Along with touring nation wide, Dara has been recording some original 
tracks and putting them out on his Breakbeat Science and Orgone Recordings 
imprints. Breakbeat Science is not only his label, but it is also the 
first and biggest drum 'n' bass store, co-founded by Dara. Dara has done 
an array of remixes including on singles from DJ's such as Keoki, 
Pizzicato Five, Dog Eat Dog, Black Nostaljack and Afrika Bambaata.

With the recent eruption of Drum and Bass in the U.S., DJ Dara isn't going 
anywhere. There is no telling what kind of damage his next endeavors might 
do.


Dj Abstract - San Francisco, CA - DnB - Phunckateck Communications, Pneuma 
Recordings, Just 2 Management, www.justtwo.com, www.djabstract.com

Abstract is widely considered to be one of the most influential players in 
the United States drum and bass scene - from throwing the seminal Bay Area 
weekly "Energi" to Djing with Phunckateck Communications to starting his 
label Pneuma Recordings, Alex has dedicated all his spare energy and time 
into helping to forge what is now one of the nation's strongest scenes in 
San Francisco. Over the eight years that he's been djing, Alex has become 
famous for his seamless mixing, impeccable track selection, and his 
ability to move any crowd (an ability that has brought him requests from 
all over the United States and as far away as Ireland, Denmark, Costa 
Rica, Puerto Rico, and Russia), but these days he's also known as one of 
the US's most well-respected producers. He has an impressive discography 
including releases on Rawkus, Moonshine, Sunburn, Green, F-111, Subtitles, 
OM, Phuturo, Breakbeat Science, Pneuma, and more, including upcoming 
releases on Formation, among others. His tracks have been played by 
leading Djs such as Rap, Dom and Roland, SS, K/Polar, Klute, and Goldie, 
and he has collaborated with noted artists such as TeeBee, Calibre, and 
UFO!. Due to his talent as both producer and Dj, Abstract has been 
featured in URB's "Top 100", the German magazine DeBug, the US' premier 
D&B magazine, Tha Pride, Muzik magazine (record of the month), and XLR8R 
magazine, as well as a slew of website/online and offline radio features - 
not to mention Phunckateck interviews too numerous to list. Pneuma has 
grown into one of the most respected American Drum and Bass labels around, 
one of the few non-british labels to have a british distribution deal , 
and continues to release quality material from the Phunckateck camp. In 
addition to his well-established career as one of the top names in the US 
Drum and Bass scene, Abstract has been making noise in the 2step, 
Breakbeat, Techouse, and Broken Beat scenes as of late, with releases on 
numerous labels including Dj Deekline's Rat Records, Vehicle, 
OM/Colourforms, Verde, Sub Funk, Non Stop, Pallette, Marc 4 Hero's Twisted 
Funk Imprint, and many more. His travels in these genres have brought him 
to Seattle, LA, Miami, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Finland, Sweden, London 
and more...

High Contrast ( Hospital Records, Breakbeat Science) London UK

High Contrast is young Cardiff-based dj/producer Lincoln Barret, one of 
the leading artists in the soulful drum+bass scene. His music fuses many 
styles, from deep jazz to soundtracks, garage to disco. High Contrast 
reputation has ceaslessly gone from strength to strength, making colossal 
waves in the drum+bass scene. Most memorable are his latest releases "Make 
It Tonight", which received a caning from virtually every high profile dj 
in the drum+bass fraternity, and his superb reworkings of Hatiras' "Spaced 
Invader" and London Elektricity vs Robert Owens' "My Dreams". Lincoln is 
currently remixing a track for DJ Marky's next EP on V Recordings, and has 
been nominated for 3 gongs (Best Producer, Best Drum+Bass DJ and Best 
remix) at The Welsh Music Awards. Not many drum and bass artists can claim 
so much airplay on Radio One: not one Fabio+Grooverider radio show has 
gone by in the past few months without a High Contrast tune!

Sat Mar 29                ANALOGUE HEAVEN MIDWEST V              NE Indiana

[not music, but gear related]

Analogue Heaven MidWest 2003

"The Voyager Home"
Official Information

The FIFTH annual AHMW get-together will be Saturday, March 29th at the 
PHHS Auditorium. I'll be there by 9:00 am. Who knows what time (or day) it 
will be when we're done :) All synthgeekgearheads are encouraged to join 
us and spend some time with awesome gear and great people.

AHMW 2003 is held in NE Indiana, midway between three empires of synth 
music: Detroit, Chicago, and... uh... Dayton!

MAP #1 shows the location relative to Interstate 69 and the Indiana Toll 
Road.
MAP #2 shows the close-up view of where to park for easy gear unloading.

Please bring a $5 - $10 "Free will" donation to help pay for auditorium 
rental

The exact address is 245 S 1150 E, Lagrange, IN 46795
If you need help getting here, just email me.
drew@ph.k12.in.us

What to bring:
* Your cool synths
* Long extension cords and power strips
* Audio cables, small mixer and headphones
* Camera!

With so many synths begging to be played, headphones are ideal for 
exploring all the different instruments people bring.
I have a PA for the performances. Anyone wishing to bring additional PA 
equipment will be welcomed to do so :)

Performances:
Live performances of all kinds are encouraged. There are plans underway to 
record them and burn AHMW2003 CD's.
We should probably try to sync up a jam session as well :)

Food:
We will collect orders and $ for lunch and dinner. Lunch will be 
sandwiches from the Lagrange Subway, and dinner will be Papa John's pizza. 
Feel free to bring your own if you wish. There are a couple nearby 
restaurants and gas stations, but not much. Angola and Lagrange have 
McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc. PHHS is a rural school.

Also, since this is a school building, consumption of alcohol on the 
grounds is illegal, and smoking is not permitted inside.


A few of the local motels would be:

Ramada Inn (R on map #1) North of Angola at I69 exit 154
$89 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9471
has restaurant, bar, indoor pool and sauna

Best Western (W on map #1) At Highway 20 and I69 exit 148
$65 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9165

I can't tell you much about these, having never stayed at any of them. 
Several people stayed at the Best Western last year...

ROB GEE & NATAS PRODUCTIONS *live*  //  2:00 - 3:00
(A.D.A.M. Recordings, NATAS Productions, La Coresa Nostra - NJ)
ROB GEE proves time and time again that he is a true entertainer. When he 
steps on a stage to do a live performance, he does not rely on machines 
and computers to recreate what has been done in the studio. Instead, he 
leads his team of talented musicians in the game of moving the crowd.

Einstein.  Are you ready to go Fucking Insane in the pit with their unique 
style of Aggressive Dance And Music?!!!!  

NEOPHYTE *live*  //  4:00 - 5:00
(Rotterdam Records, Neophyte Records - Holland)
Neophyte started their hardcore-band in 1992. After giving Demo tapes to 
DJ Paul, their first release was "the 3 amiga's E.P" on Rotterdam Records.
The band became more and more popular in Holland because of their crazy 
stage-act and hardcore with an own face and own vocals. After 2 years the 
popularity spread throughout Europe, with many gigs in Scotland, England, 
Belgium, France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Italy. In 1995 
one of the producers/MC -Jeroen Streunding- decided to start Dj'ing 
seriously, after spinning for fun at small party's for a few years.  
Nowadays they produce projects like: Neophyte, Body lotion, Masters of 
Ceremony and Hard Creation. They run their own label "Neophyte Records", 
and they still do many remixes for well-known producers all over the 
world.

HEADBANGER  //  5:00 - 6:00

Since 1985, Headbanger has been tearing up dance floors in Germany, Italy, 
Holland and Switzerland to name a few with his pounding hardcore beats. Be 
sure to pick up his new release with DJ Delirium entitled "Danger" on 
Megarave records.  If you've never seen Headbanger before, you're in for a

Pittsburgh, PA
http://www.elementfive.info

greetings PGH massive,

A lot has changed in our city over the past year. 

Seeds planted before the winter freeze now sprout from
beneath the surface. Those who happened to indulge in
some happenings this past weekend [such as Friday
night at the Warhol, Saturday at The Kelly-Strayhorn,
Sunday at The Pittsburgh Filmmakers and Metropol] got
a taste of the new culture evolving in the city of
bridges. Once disparate elements are finding new
connections out of which a unique community is
coalescing. The momentum is ever gathering...

Still believe there's not much going on in the steel
city?

Take the element 5 challenge:

[Thu Mar 6]   CodeThree Productions Versus Sessions
featuring J Flint, Gerald Heymon, Enrique, Carolyn
Perteete, John B, Hill Jordan, Elie Kihonia, Shawn
Rudiman, and a secret weapon from the deep warehouse
of Jerry's Records at Club Cafe. If you dug our
Momentum events last year, let the CodeThree crew take
you to your next stage in life.

[Fri Mar 7]   UNBLURRED!!! The city's East-End comes
alive along Penn Ave as a host of venues, including
the Quiet Storm, Shadow Lounge, Pittsburgh Glass
Center, the Garfield Artworks + others celebrate the
first Friday of the month with events that blur the
line between music, art, and urban culture.

[Sat Mar 8]   Live Salsa at Cozumel, Liz Berlin &
friends at The Rex, Indie rock & Triple M Metal at The
Roboto Project, and late night happenings in East
Liberty.

[Sun Mar 9]   Spoken Word at The Quiet Storm, Live
Jazz at  The Shadow Lounge, and Deep Soulful Grooves
at Pub I.G.

[Mon Mar 10]   Monday night film + discussion at The
Oaks Theater topped off with Jazz at  the Crawford
Grill

[Tues Mar 11]   Food, Drinks, and Rare Grooves hosted
by Meg F of 720 Records at Kelly's Bar & Grill.

[Wed Mar 12]   James Turrell Lecture - "Plato's Cave
and the Light Within" at the CMU School of Art
followed by an appearance at Club Laga by the one and
only Big Daddy Kane.


Some additional temptations:

[Mar 18] George Clinton w/ Parliament|Funkadelic at
Club Laga

[Mar 29] World renowned turntablist J-Rocc from the
BeatJunkies at Mr.Smalls.

[Apr 5] Flux No. 9 in Oakland, featuring a whole slew
of local artists including element 5's own DJ crew
Technoir-Audio 

and a whole lot more....

There's a lot of activity beneath the surface.
Explore, enyoy... 

...and keep your good vibes strong!

Note that the Propellerheads have released the Reason 2.5 Beta. I don't
think either of those fellahs know anything about Reason. Bush likes to
think he knows all about Recycle, but he doesn't. Ableton is up to
version 2.02 of Live, but if these guys have there way, no one will Live
to see the day. Perhaps if the our navy used Sonar, we'd all be better
off. No one in the navy is using Fruity or Buzz -- it's against their
policies. 

Ok, enough!

Subject: {pb-cle} Track ID - Odi @ One Love

If anyone remembers that I really needed to know this track that he 
played sometime in the middle to end of his set...the words came to me 
today, it goes something like "Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boooom.... I 
like it when i move, move, move???" Im not the biggest DnB head but I 
tune in now and again, and I hope this one isnt some overplayed song 
that has been getting played for a year.
Thankz,
Alex

High Contrast ( Hospital Records, Breakbeat Science) London UK

High Contrast is young Cardiff-based dj/producer Lincoln Barret, one of the 
leading artists in the soulful drum+bass scene. His music fuses many styles, 
from deep jazz to soundtracks, garage to disco. High Contrast reputation has 
ceaslessly gone from strength to strength, making colossal waves in the 
drum+bass scene. Most memorable are his latest releases "Make It Tonight", 
which received a caning from virtually every high profile dj in the 
drum+bass fraternity, and his superb reworkings of Hatiras' "Spaced Invader" 
and London Elektricity vs Robert Owens' "My Dreams". Lincoln is currently 
remixing a track for DJ Marky's next EP on V Recordings, and has been 
nominated for 3 gongs (Best Producer, Best Drum+Bass DJ and Best remix) at 
The Welsh Music Awards. Not many drum and bass artists can claim so much 
airplay on Radio One: not one Fabio+Grooverider radio show has gone by in 
the past few months without a High Contrast tune!

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} ::true:: at abbasso this fri.

Hey, this night is becoming quite the tight gathering.  It REALLY IS about
the music.  I've only had chance to make it on a couple occasions, but wish
I could each week.

If you are looking for great group of people very into the music and dance,
this is DEFINITELY the place for you.

I've heard some people speak poorly of abbaso back in the day, but this
event has turned it all around.

The music headz should be there.  We need to support and keep it alive.

I know a LOT of people and I have never heard anyone speak poorly of Abasso.

I really have never been out there except for once, but from what I hear it
IS the place to be if your looking for a good time, good people, and fair
prices.

Napolean and crew treat local djs fairly, and they do what they can to make
sure everyone has a place to play.  If you are a young aspiring dj, they
have true open tables on thursday and that is the spotlight.   They also do
a phenomenal job of booking and advertising other local djs to keep this
scene diverse and alive.

One of these days I will make it out, True had sounded like a good reason
but now I work friday nights.  I'm now just starting to enjoy my saturday
nights off, so maybe here in the future.

::true:: is a great night.  I've found that the vibe of the Abbasso room is 
quite charming, and have enjoyed DJing there myself.  Deviate yourself off 
the beaten path and go there!

Oh yeah, also Roger Sanchez will be @ CentroFly in NYC tonight [that's where 
i'll be ;) ]

i'm looking for a company who can print stickers, preferably one who will consider discounts for an anti-war campaign.

also i'm looking for helpers to stick the bumper stickers on suv's parked at walmart, etc. they will say "nuke iraq - these things don't run on water!"

i don't intend on having a major discussion over this. thanks for your help.

Check out sticker guy:

http://www.stickerguy.com/

He's independent, works out of Reno, and last I heard, did not solicit or
fill orders for corporations.  He's done a lot of works for bands,
independent labels and subversive organizations.  I have my own Froggystyle
stickers printed through him as well as other orders.

The turnaround can be awhile if you're going to do it cheaply, but you can
get 250 basic black and white stickers printed for like $20.

Anyway, check it out.

Messing with my vehicle will result in a steel toed boot upside your fucking 
head.

Regardless of the sticker's intended message, and fuel economy of my car.

I'll bet there are a lot of iron workers and railroad employees who would 
agree with me on that.

Good luck with your safety.

Absolutely 

...not to mention the fact that a sizeable number of
the popluation may agree with the literal
interpretation of the sticker as opposed to its
intended interpretation.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sticker printing & sticking

Actually I drive a modest, fuel efficient, mid-size sedan. SUVs are cool in 
some aspects, but I think that a vehicle should be utilized for its intended 
use.

Yuppies who drive Land Rover Discoveries around Shadyside, while wearing 
fresh new K2 mountain climbing gear, who never hit anywhere remotely 
offroad, make me laugh.

I was just slightly overexaggerating my hostility towards people that mess 
with other people's cars. There are some people out there who will genuinely 
become violent for such a thing. My suspicion is that there are a lot of 
truck and SUV owners who fall into that category.

maybe you are thinking of venus, that club is in the hood, but 1120 is right off of central parkway and one block off the main st. entertainment district across from barrelhouse.  we get a few homeless guys trolling for money, but its not in the hood.

1120 is a high quality venue designed strictly for your enjoyment and
safety. 1120 features a coat check, multiple bars w/ top shelf drinks, a
massive sound, video and light rig in the main room, a second room with a
comfortable lounge atmosphere and is furnished throughout with
fashion-forward decor designed by PAOLO-Cincinnati. }}

I might go anyway though. Simply Jeff is pretty straight.

You don't intend on having a major discussion over this? Is that
because deep down you really are aware that defacing private property
is ethically wrong, no matter how good your cause? I would kick your
ass if you stuck something on my car.

Venus is a total shithole and I'd probably never go there again unless
someone like General Midi was in town. I know exactly where 1120 is - I
almost leased an apartment right there on Jackson (Hale Justis), but it was
too hoodtastic for me. Somebody also tried to jump in my car once about a
block down from there.

I'll probably be there anyway, so.... it's all good...

yeah, just stick to good ol' fashion tradition of placing flyers

time).

If you have $2100 to burn, go for 2 Mackie 624s and the Mackie HR 120.   They 
are studio THX production speakers and sound un-freaking believable!   They 
would make fantastic computer speakers.   if only the $ were around.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sticker printing & sticking

I drive an SUV so that I can move my DJ gear from place to place.

I am staunchly anti-war thank you, but if little some sarcastic little shit slaps any sticker on my
car, I will NOT be pleased, and neither will the cops when I call them. There are better ways of
making your point. Vandalism isn't an answer.

Now...getting naked and laying down in the Wal-Mart parking lot (like those women in the UK did in a
field) would work....you'll get your message out, guaranteed. The news would be all over that shit.

(one suggestion, though...wait til all the snow melts....shrinkage is a bad thing...)

i'm looking for a company who can print stickers, preferably one who will consider discounts for an
anti-war campaign.

also i'm looking for helpers to stick the bumper stickers on suv's parked at walmart, etc. they will
say "nuke iraq - these things don't run on water!"

i don't intend on having a major discussion over this. thanks for your help.

i have to argue. vandalism is a great answer if its done
consistantly and on a large scale basis. if enough people did
enough serious vadalism to SUVs everywhere, people would become
afraid to drive them anywhere. just putting stickers on is stupid.
slashing all your tires and breaking all your windows is probably
pretty effective. direct action is one of the few things i believe
in as far as DIY changing society.

So has mine. I moved around an entire setup in an 89 Dodge Omni for years. I'm a bit beyond that

So if you keep fucking with people, they become afriad of you and bend to your will?

so by your estimation, taking out hitler is bad because he has his
will, right? there is a moral right and wrong, and the difference
is taking out the wrong things when you have the right things
behind you is whats up. hitler is more like the SUV: destructive
in a bad way. obviously, hitler had to be killed to stop him from
killing more. and SUVs need to be destroyed to prevent them from
further destruction that they will cause.

Anyways, what is wrong with SUV's? If this is all about differing opinions
on whether SUV's suck or not, those who jump in to argue are really just
gay - all pun intended.  I dont own one of these vehicles, but I wish I did.
Why, because in my opinion, they sure beat country fuck trucks.  If you want
to go off roading, or camping, or need a place warm place to crash while
doing so, I cant think of anything better suited.  They are meant to be a
truck that drives like a car. Whats wrong with that?  To each his own.  I
think people who drive cars with fake wood on the sides are all white trash.
I am not going to do something against them, nor argue that they suck. I
already know they do. Whats the point?

Once there was a woman in the Kroger parking lot near here, yelling and 
screaming at people in SUV's, also shouting some crap about how the 
bags we were all using were environmentally unfriendly.

Then she got into her dodge rambler with save the planet stickers all 
over it. Thick black smoke quickly filled the parking lot and she sped 
(haha, sped) away.

Not a Sped,

Mike

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sticker printing & sticking

Before you worry about SUV's, why not sticker the CEO of every automobile company that continues to
prohibit the affordable production and sale of vehicles that use renewable energy sources? I'd say
their actions are pretty destructive on a larger scale than me and my Ford Explorer.

Or how about some of those nice diesel excavating vehicles that are destroying rainforests by the
hundreds of acres every day.

Or how about slapping a shitload of stickers all over some coal-fueled power plant. There are about
12 in Western Pennsylvania alone....

You're talking about fucking with average people like you and I when you could be fucking with
corporations and lawmakers who have a lot more to do with the destruction of the environment and
American dependence on foreign oil.

Again, you're missing the big picture here. By attacking the symptom, you're not going to make the
source of the infection any less damaging.

Here's a novel idea....Take that money you'd use to buy stickers and buy yourself a congressman.
Last I checked, they're open to accepting campaign donations, and they're readily available to lobby
on your behalf if you've first lined their pockets with some dead presidents....If you're gonna
break the law, do it in a way that matters.

By breaking the law in the way you're suggesting, you're nothing more than a petty criminal, and
you're infintely more likely to FURTHER alienate and lose credibility with the community that CAN
effect the changes that need made. You become nothing more than a temporary nuissance who, with a
couple pieces of paper and some fancy wording, up the legal penalty for placing some stickers on
SUV's, and slap your ass in jail for taxpayers to support for an indefinite amount of time.

So people stop buying SUV's? Whooptie shit...the big 5 manufacturers will find something else that
you will buy. And guess what it's going to run on?

Black gold....Texas T....Oil, that is....

And furthermore, regardless of your percieved morality on my choice of vehicle, that won't stop me
from needing to move my shit from point A to point B. There is nothing in my morality that is
reprehensible or wrong about driving an SUV for my purposes. If you'd like to buy me one of those
nice $30G electric cars, be my guest.

Go after the source of the infection, not the symptom.

so by your estimation, taking out hitler is bad because he has his will, right? there is a moral
right and wrong, and the difference is taking out the wrong things when you have the right things
behind you is whats up. hitler is more like the SUV: destructive in a bad way. obviously, hitler had
to be killed to stop him from killing more. and SUVs need to be destroyed to prevent them from
further destruction that they will cause.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} sticker printing & sticking

Violence is in human nature. It always has been, and always will. Of course
society will influence this to a certain degree, especially in America, but
not limited to. Violence would be the natural reaction of any person in a
free society, if they had the means to use it.  Our country is founded on
using violence to protect what is ours.  It is within our rights to do so;
to use force upon those that will violate our right to personal property.
Therefore, I will exercise these rights to the fullest extent, protecting
what is mine, by all means granted to me, in the name of freedom, in the
name of the American way.

I have the truths and I am pretty satisfied with them. Very good sound

Subject: {pb-cle} Simply Jeff @ 1120?

It's always nice to get fucked on a friday night, but not like this...

Where was he? And could I stand any more "tech" house upstairs? Downstairs
was okay, but the whole club was nearly empty. 1120 is a cool club, though,
and more people should go there...

And is it in the hood? Well, Roxy says no but I don't know how confident I
am.

No fatties.

sweet party, not too big of a crowd, I think more people were at the 
robin hood in kent when dara came out there. the alarm system was going 
off all night which was kinda annoying, but the sound system covered it 
up allrite. might have to start going out to toledo more often, looks 
like their scene ig growing.

I also had a very good time!!  It was good to see other Cleveland peeps 
there.  My crew and I got there shortly before 10 and stayed all the way 
through the end, which was at 5.  I enjoyed everyone's set.  My legs are 
still sore from all the dancing I did.  Thanks to Dan for the awesome event!

Subject: {pb-cle} sharewall p2p firewall (release)

Just figured I would let everyone know since there are a lot of people
that
Share music on here.

My program I have been working on is finally released for its initial
public testing. The program, Sharewall is a P2P firewall system to stop
the wrong people from seeing what music you have shared. This is
defiantly a must for people sharing music on (Soulseek, Kazaa,
Bearshare, Limewire). More information can be found on the website.

You can all check it out here:
http://www.iwantcode.com/sharewall

Please email all bugs to sharewall@iwantcode.com

Thanks for your help,
-ben

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} is this ad legit?!

My guess is that it's a French/Europena ad.  That sort of advertising is
very common in Europe.  I.e.

On the way back to Gatwick airport, I passed a poster that had a flaming
redhead in a blue bikini on a beach staring down her briefs.  The
caption "Lasts so long you'll forget your natural color"

The ads in every Internet Caf=E9 had Yahoo! Weather updates on your =
mobile
ads that went something like "Fancy a shower?  Like it hot and wet?
Yahoo! Weather updates on your mobile"

And Yahoo's Internet Life magazine had a lot of large billboards and a
cover that was a woman with a half open blouse.


Although on a strict note of compare/contrast advertising I personally
would have put one of the pictures without the puma and without the
*ahem*.  Singles out the product.

Subject: {pb-cle} Hello again everyone!

Hey there everyone,

Just wanted to crawl out from under this rock to say hello to everyone that 
we know that MAY still be on this list (anyone?!) :-). I rejoined today, and 
hope to hear/see some intelligent discussion of music... (ahh, to dream...).

Hopefully we will be out and about to say hello in person one of these days 
soon...

Take care!
Casey & Wayne

The Touch Supper Club in Cleveland has really been rockin it these past couple of months. On Saturday they brought in Q-Burns for a fabulous night of entertainment. What a great time! Its almost as fun just to watch him play as it is to get down to his funky beats. The man doesnt miss a step. I couldnt help but dance the entire time. I was a little surprised that the crowd in the basement thinned out the way it did when the music was bumpin like it was, but, then, the place does have a bit of the Chach-factor, black-cow posse (leather jacket crew types). That is probably the only drawback at Touch (and a minor one at that) besides the cover. They have done a great job bringing the music to get my groove on and its worth it every time. They had Romanowski for a great show, and Mr.Scruff for godsake!! That was the shit! If you haven't checked it out, I highly suggest giving it a shot. On March 16th, Jazzanova will be there for a special Nitty Gritty. Thanks to Touch for bringing the funk to Cleveland. 
-Jessica
p.s. Speaking of Funk...if you are in Akron on Thursday night, the Lime Spider on Main Street is having a free, thats right, FREE night of funk! Starts at 10:30.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Touch Review

INDEED.

Touch is really a fun place when the entertainment is on point.

I haven't made it out to a Chicago Session, but nitty gritty and all related
events are always dope as well as the 2 shift parties I have attended.

I was one of the people who left befor Q-Burns really got into it, my eyes
were burning and I could barely keep them open.

BUT... this sunday... Jazzanova returns.

I _expect_ to see a good number of listees at this event :)   I am way
excited for this and it will be a great way to wind down Funky Charms
weekend.  There are A LOT of events in the next 8-9 days, so make sure you
are out.

nobody got fucked.  simply jeff was on saturday night and he simply rocked it.
lots of good tracks including the plump djs rmx of that omnipresent me and my computer track, some white label goodies on phonomental, kemek and that doug lazy remix from a couple months back.  the club was 75% full both up and down (an asian sorority had a party earlier downstairs) and people came out on the first night w/ nice weather on the weekend since the club opened.

It's always nice to get fucked on a friday night, but not like this...

Where was he? And could I stand any more "tech" house upstairs? Downstairs
was okay, but the whole club was nearly empty. 1120 is a cool club, though,
and more people should go there...

And is it in the hood? Well, Roxy says no but I don't know how confident I
am.

No fatties.

Just wanted to crawl out from under this rock to say hello to everyone that
we know that MAY still be on this list (anyone?!) :-). I rejoined today, and
hope to hear/see some intelligent discussion of music... (ahh, to

Whoa... I heard you guys died in that plane crash with Bad Boy Bill.

I've just come back myself after about a 3 month hiatus. You must have time

Why be torn when you can have both?

Her top 10 definitely has some good tracks, and if she can actually spin
records, then I might be a marrying man.

I'd probably rather have DJ Rap though.

Control the Night and Quantum Bass presents..

"REBIRTH"
Matt B's Birthday Party!

Every Tuesday

Regional, national and international DnB acts

Best regional House, Trance and Techno acts

3/18
High Contrast ( Hospital Records, Breakbeat Science) London UK

High Contrast is young Cardiff-based dj/producer Lincoln Barret, one of the 
leading artists in the soulful drum+bass scene. His music fuses many styles, 
from deep jazz to soundtracks, garage to disco. High Contrast reputation has 
ceaslessly gone from strength to strength, making colossal waves in the 
drum+bass scene. Most memorable are his latest releases "Make It Tonight", 
which received a caning from virtually every high profile dj in the 
drum+bass fraternity, and his superb reworkings of Hatiras' "Spaced Invader" 
and London Elektricity vs Robert Owens' "My Dreams". Lincoln is currently 
remixing a track for DJ Marky's next EP on V Recordings, and has been 
nominated for 3 gongs (Best Producer, Best Drum+Bass DJ and Best remix) at 
The Welsh Music Awards. Not many drum and bass artists can claim so much 
airplay on Radio One: not one Fabio+Grooverider radio show has gone by in 
the past few months without a High Contrast tune!

This event brought to you by Experimedia Communications, Molotov Records, Headroom Digital, Shift Club Night, and Touch Supper Club.

"This is one of the most significant rosters I've ever observed to grace the area and it's even more taunting for me that I couldn't be there to support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're truly privileged to be offered such rare appearances courtesy of the event producers who're credited. Those responsible obviously share an increasingly rare enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast with most 'parties'. They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an intimate setting, thus providing an amazing opportunity to witness these talents whose impact is undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all involved and encourage anyone who can't stand 'the same' music being played at 'parties' to treat yourself to an evening of what is sure to be a great experience and hopefully an eye-opening impression on a few of you!"

 Sica <sicasinkin@yahoo.com> wrote:The Touch Supper Club in Cleveland has really been rockin it these past couple of months. On Saturday they brought in Q-Burns for a fabulous night of entertainment. What a great time! Its almost as fun just to watch him play as it is to get down to his funky beats. The man doesnt miss a step. I couldnt help but dance the entire time. I was a little surprised that the crowd in the basement thinned out the way it did when the music was bumpin like it was, but, then, the place does have a bit of the Chach-factor, black-cow posse (leather jacket crew types). That is probably the only drawback at Touch (and a minor one at that) besides the cover. They have done a great job bringing the music to get my groove on and its worth it every time. They had Romanowski for a great show, and Mr.Scruff for godsake!! That was the shit! If you haven't checked it out, I highly suggest giving it a shot. On March 16th, Jazzanova will be there for a special Nitty Gritty. Thanks to Touch for bringing the funk to Cleveland. 
-Jessica
p.s. Speaking of Funk...if you are in Akron on Thursday night, the Lime Spider on Main Street is having a free, thats right, FREE night of funk! Starts at 10:30.

  You and I both know it could happen one day but only if the people of NE Ohio show that they want it.  And the way its going now I am assuming they dont.  I guess we would have to stoop down to booking Paul Oakenfold and have foam machines if we want anyone to pay attention.  Right!

Subject: {pb-cle} Therapy- THIS FRIDAY- Columbus, OH DJ Spettro


Greetings Pb-Cle massive.
Just a quick reminder about our monthly here in Columbus.
Fresh, underground House music at it's finest.  If any of you all 
would like to come and check it out, I have 5 guestlist spots to 
the first 5 people who e-mail me back.  This should be a great 
night, hope to see some of you out.  Check the link below for a RA 
mix...
Details Below..

Jason "Lemon" Lyman

Godown Productions prestents: 
THERAPY- Your monthly dose of Fresh House Music. 
Therapy is the newest monthly in Columbus bringing you fresh and 
cutting edge house music from local and national DJ's. This month 
we are pleased to bring you 
DJ SPETTRO(Dusttraxx,Aroma, Brique Rougue, Amenti, San Antonio, 
TX) 
www.spettromusic.com 


Spettro isn=92t a name you should watch for; it=92s a name you should 
know. If not, get thee to thyne local house purist and ask about 
his record "I Think I" on the Swirl People's label Aroma or 
his "Gotcha EP" on David Duriez's Brique Rouge label. You'll 
surely get an enthusiastic description of a straightforward dubbed 
house groove with Balearic guitars, smokin live percussion and 
some sweet n lovely vocal snippets. He has recently seen one of 
his tracks liscensed to Kinetinc records for use on the newest DJ 
DAN mix CD, and another to Defected for the latest JAY-J and 
MIGUEL MIGS(Naked Music) mix CD. 
Spettro has been featured in the "Hey DJ" section in URB Magazine 
(June 2002), and was featured in Austin's Feedback Magazine (July 
2002). His tracks have been reviewed in URB, DJ Mag, Feedback 
Magazine and endorsed on the charts of taste-maker djs like Mazi, 
Jay-J, Chris Lum, David Duriez, Murray Richardson, and Phil Weeks. 
Spettro has gained world wide respect as a hard working 
dj/producer with tracks out now on labels from 6 different 
countries including Bosh, Aquarius, Brique Rouge, Crack & Speed, 
and more coming this fall on Amenti, Chalant, Brique Rouge, and 
Simple Soul. He's also just signed a remix of a HARDKISS track to 
DERRICK CARTER'S seminal Classic Music label. Not surprisingly, 
our sources indicate that his best work has yet to come. 
To listen to a small mix on line, go to:

Subject: {pb-cle} Funky Charms 4 Lineup

{{ jea <chiky216@andythepooh.com> }
Does anyone have a clue to the lineup for this?.. Just curious. }}

Yeah, uh... me too and stuff.

Seriously. I'm (planning on) coming from out of town for this. Someone cut
me a break here. Also if anyone wants to adopt me for the weekend (hot

I apologize for the lack of a general 'heads up' for everyone here on the list, but in regards to the timeslots, we're still composing a tentative lineup for general reference until the day(s) of the show. This would have been released a bit earlier, but quality control has been the first priority from the beginning and there's been a slight setback for sharing the times of performances. A handful of confirmations need to be made, but please keep in mind that while it'll be mostly accurate, there will be some rearrangements for the sake of everyone's satisfaction... we'll be sending it to the list before heading out to the Hood in Kent tonight for last chance presale availability... come on out, it's sure to be a fun evening!

SAT 3/15:  Satoshi Tomiie @ Moda in Cleveland

http://www.satoshitomiie.com

This Saturday, Japan native and Saw Record Label owner Satoshi Tomiie will
be bringing his signature sound for a long awaited Cleveland appearance at
Moda Nightclub.  Satoshi's music career began at an early age with piano and
developed into a distinct passion for jazz. After playing in several school
bands, the sound of Hip Hop provoked him to not only form his own band but
also to start his foray into DJ'ing and production. Then came house, as he
became  fascinated by the early Chicago mix-tapes he was hearing.

A Japanese cosmetic company asked Satoshi to produce a track for their
forthcoming promo parties where legendary DJ Frankie Knuckles was
performing. Knuckles saw the potential in Satoshi's music and asked if he
was interested in collaborating. The final result of their partnership was
"Tears", a defining moment in vocal house and a song now commonly regarded
as an all time classic. Satoshi soon took the leap and moved to New York.
Since his seminal hit "Tears" with Frankie Knuckles back in 1989, he has
gone on to become a major part of the acclaimed Def Mix crew. Tomiie has
remixed and worked with the likes of Photek, Kosheen, Simply Red, David
Bowie, U2, Mariah Carey, Misia (Japan's #1 R&B artist), just to name a few.

In 2001, Satoshi Tomiie launched his own label "SAW.RECORDINGS". It was
Satoshi's desire to create a platform from which he would be able to
showcase ideas and creativity that are more experimental and underground.
His first single entitled "Paranoize" by Bipath has caused major excitement
from DJ's worldwide.

Satoshi was the first American based DJ to be asked to record a NuBreed
album (#6).


Cover is $10, 21+ http://www.modanightclub.com for full details.

SUNDAY:  March 16th - Special Nitty Gritty with JAZZANOVA @ Touch Supper
Club in Cleveland.

The first Jazzanova show here was for many their most memorable night out in
Cleveland.  The second promises to be nothing less than the first.  I can
not think of a better way to wind down the weekend!!!!!!!!  I expect to see
many people recovering from FC4, as well as the other events.  You can
expect to see me there seated at the bar by 10pm -- you WILL want to get
here early.  Many of you can't make it out for a normal Nitty Gritty
event -- this is your chance!!!!!!!!!  I'm not sure what to expect
musically, but I expect it will range from downtempo to some more
intelligent house beats.

This Sunday, March 16th, Jurgen of Jazzanova will be returning to Touch for
a rare US appearance before he braves the chaos of the Winter Music
Conference.
They advise coming early.

I'm pretty sure this is 21+, but if want a better answer email me directly
and help you find out... doug@visn.net

TUESDAY:  March 18th - HIGH CONTRAST @ The Robin Hood in Kent (Also Matt B's
from Control The Night's Birthday party).

This is another must attend event if you are into some HIGH QUALITY drum &
bass.  This is some intelligent, good, funky shit right here.

Control the Night and Quantum Bass presents.. "REBIRTH" with

High Contrast ( Hospital Records, Breakbeat Science) London UK

High Contrast is young Cardiff-based dj/producer Lincoln Barret, one of the
leading artists in the soulful drum+bass scene. His music fuses many styles,
from deep jazz to soundtracks, garage to disco. High Contrast reputation has
ceaslessly gone from strength to strength, making colossal waves in the
drum+bass scene. Most memorable are his latest releases "Make It Tonight",
which received a caning from virtually every high profile dj in the
drum+bass fraternity, and his superb reworkings of Hatiras' "Spaced Invader"
and London Elektricity vs Robert Owens' "My Dreams". Lincoln is currently
remixing a track for DJ Marky's next EP on V Recordings, and has been
nominated for 3 gongs (Best Producer, Best Drum+Bass DJ and Best remix) at
The Welsh Music Awards. Not many drum and bass artists can claim so much
airplay on Radio One: not one Fabio+Grooverider radio show has gone by in
the past few months without a High Contrast tune!


also performing:  Jea Leigh (controlthenight.com) Cleveland; Majestic
(quantum bass) Kent; Three (controlthenight.com) Kent

18+ Please with valid ID; Admission: $10

2 Bars.  Drink Specials.  Giveaways

=========================

Well that is it... you well definately be seeing me out at Jazzanova & High
Contrast.  Friday I will be working @ Spy.  Saturday I am going to try hit
as many as possible.  Make it a point to go out and do something quality
this weekend... there is enough of it.  I am expecting to see some people
not normally out at Touch on Sunday... there is no excuse!

Funny how, on this list, a simple post about a couch turns into porno 
references, sexual offers... lol

Aww shit... ravers.

Subject: {pb-cle} Beastie Boys

I think this tiptoes the on/off topic line because it relates to music... 
The Beasties are weighing in against the impending Middle Eastern boom boom 
with their first release in 5 years. The song is available for free download 
from their website at http://www.beastieboys.com/ Lyrics follow.


In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

Mirrors, smokescreens and lies
Its not the politicians but their actions I despise
You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day
With the cocaine and Courvoisier
But you build more bombs as you get more bold
As your mid-life crisis war unfolds
All you want to do is take control
Now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold
Citizen rule number 2080
Politicians are shady
So people watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I dont doubt it look at how they act

In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

First the War On Terror now war on Iraq
Were reaching a point where we cant turn back
Lets lose the guns and lets lose the bombs
And stop the corporate contributions that their built upon
Well Ill be sleeping on your speeches til I start to snore
Cause I wont carry guns for an oil war
As-Salamu alaikum, wa alaikum assalam
Peace to the Middle East peace to Islam
Now dont get us wrong cause we love America
But thats no reason to get hysterica
Theyre layin on the syrup thick
We aint waffles we aint havin it

In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

Now how many people must get killed?
For oil families pockets to get filled?
How many oil families get killed?
Not a damn one so whats the deal?

Its time to lead the way and de-escalate
Lose the weapons of mass destruction and the hate
Say ooh ah whats the White House doin?
Oh no! Say, what in tarnation have they got brewing??!!!!???!!
Well Im not pro Bush and Im not pro Saddam
We need these fools to remain calm
George Bush youre looking like Zoolander
Trying to play tough for the camera
What am I on crazy pills? Weve got to stop it
Get your hand out my grandmas pocket
We need health care more than going to war
You think its democracy theyre fighting for?

In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

Props to the guys for standing up and being counted, but quality-wise, this is about the worst
B-boys song I've ever heard...

The rhymes are weak as shit, the beat is straight outta 1985, and they sound like they're recording
in an airplane hanger....

I'm not anti-Beasties or anti-their sentiment, but i'm way anti-this song...I'll look for the remix.

Much agreed on all accounts.

I have a feeling that we're going to be seeing more and more of these as 
time progresses.

Lets hope there are some that can't be written off so easily as this one may 
be. Some of the lyrics definitely take away some of the impact that it could 
have on the intended audience.

Mellencamp has one out too. Its pretty decent, although not really my cup of 
musical tea.

Props to the guys for standing up and being counted, but quality-wise, this 
is about the worst
B-boys song I've ever heard...

The rhymes are weak as shit, the beat is straight outta 1985, and they sound 
like they're recording
in an airplane hanger....

I'm not anti-Beasties or anti-their sentiment, but i'm way anti-this 
song...I'll look for the remix.

I think this tiptoes the on/off topic line because it relates to music...
The Beasties are weighing in against the impending Middle Eastern boom boom
with their first release in 5 years. The song is available for free download
from their website at http://www.beastieboys.com/ Lyrics follow.


In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

Mirrors, smokescreens and lies
Its not the politicians but their actions I despise
You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day
With the cocaine and Courvoisier
But you build more bombs as you get more bold
As your mid-life crisis war unfolds
All you want to do is take control
Now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold
Citizen rule number 2080
Politicians are shady
So people watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I dont doubt it look at how they act

In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

First the War On Terror now war on Iraq
Were reaching a point where we cant turn back
Lets lose the guns and lets lose the bombs
And stop the corporate contributions that their built upon
Well Ill be sleeping on your speeches til I start to snore
Cause I wont carry guns for an oil war
As-Salamu alaikum, wa alaikum assalam
Peace to the Middle East peace to Islam
Now dont get us wrong cause we love America
But thats no reason to get hysterica
Theyre layin on the syrup thick
We aint waffles we aint havin it

In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

Now how many people must get killed?
For oil families pockets to get filled?
How many oil families get killed?
Not a damn one so whats the deal?

Its time to lead the way and de-escalate
Lose the weapons of mass destruction and the hate
Say ooh ah whats the White House doin?
Oh no! Say, what in tarnation have they got brewing??!!!!???!!
Well Im not pro Bush and Im not pro Saddam
We need these fools to remain calm
George Bush youre looking like Zoolander
Trying to play tough for the camera
What am I on crazy pills? Weve got to stop it
Get your hand out my grandmas pocket
We need health care more than going to war
You think its democracy theyre fighting for?

In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

who cares what theyre saying if the track is weak? if i wanted to
listen to political commentary, id check some political talk
shows. if youre not going to put a dope beat on it, and put some
time into writing those lyrics (PE and RATM did it for a couple
albums each) then i really dont care. id rather hear someone rap
about champagne than bullshit politics any day. 

>cant wait for their next album

why? they havent had a good new song since 1994. i guess that
"alive" track was alright, but their last album was the biggest
piece of garbage ive ever heard. theyre old and too afraid to say
anything that someone might be offended by. theyre just so
irrelevant.

yeah, i know lots of people like bad music. i was a beastie boys
fan before you were in kindergarten. i think i can be critical of
the crap they release now, thanks. 

>anyways how the fuck are you gonna slate the track based on 3 peoples
>reviews...why dont you listen for yourself and make your own opinion

because i wont listen to hastily written, recorded, and released
"anti-war" songs for the same reason i wont listen to any bullshit
"9-11 was so horrible" songs: no one can do the sentiment any
justice. also, those lyrics were amongst the crappest ive ever
read. i think my little sister could have written an iller
anti-war rap.

Oy.

Crap crap crap.

While I won't go as far as Tom, I'll definitely agree on the hastily written and recorded sentiment.
I dig the Beasties. Had L2Ill back in 86...tho i think i was in 4th or 5th grade when it came
out....I know my uncle was rockin' the Cookiepuss 12" a bit prior to then, and I thought it was
funny sounding.

A few more thoughts as to why this song won't be more than a blip on the radar...
1) This song will never be played on a Clear(ly our dicks are in the Senators' mouths) Channel
station.
2) Its intended audience (us and those in the early to mid 20's) are a pretty mixed bag when it
comes to opinions on this war.
3) Regardless of its creators' intent, this is shaping up to be "Vietnam Redux"....and there are
bound to be way more (and better) songs about it.

I think we're moving into another political action period...circa the late 60's. People are getting
fed up with corporate bullshit, spin-job news, and being force-fed ideas. To paraphrase another
Beastie's song...Something's gotta give.

I think this tiptoes the on/off topic line because it relates to music...
The Beasties are weighing in against the impending Middle Eastern boom boom
with their first release in 5 years. The song is available for free download

In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

Mirrors, smokescreens and lies
Its not the politicians but their actions I despise
You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day
With the cocaine and Courvoisier
But you build more bombs as you get more bold
As your mid-life crisis war unfolds
All you want to do is take control
Now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold
Citizen rule number 2080
Politicians are shady
So people watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I dont doubt it look at how they act

In a world gone mad its hard to think right

First the War On Terror now war on Iraq
Were reaching a point where we cant turn back
Lets lose the guns and lets lose the bombs
And stop the corporate contributions that their built upon
Well Ill be sleeping on your speeches til I start to snore
Cause I wont carry guns for an oil war
As-Salamu alaikum, wa alaikum assalam
Peace to the Middle East peace to Islam
Now dont get us wrong cause we love America
But thats no reason to get hysterica
Theyre layin on the syrup thick
We aint waffles we aint havin it

In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

Now how many people must get killed?
For oil families pockets to get filled?
How many oil families get killed?
Not a damn one so whats the deal?

Its time to lead the way and de-escalate
Lose the weapons of mass destruction and the hate
Say ooh ah whats the White House doin?
Oh no! Say, what in tarnation have they got brewing??!!!!???!!
Well Im not pro Bush and Im not pro Saddam
We need these fools to remain calm
George Bush youre looking like Zoolander
Trying to play tough for the camera
What am I on crazy pills? Weve got to stop it
Get your hand out my grandmas pocket
We need health care more than going to war
You think its democracy theyre fighting for?

In a world gone mad its hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight

in their defense, tom, i don't think the intent was to offend. i'm pretty sure they moved past the
"let's shock and horrify people" stage after "license to ill".

and i think there were some pretty shining moments on "hello nasty"...they haven't been afraid to
introduce their listeners to some "new" sounds...punk, bossa nova, live instruments...i have a hard
time figuring out where "irrelavent" comes into the argument.

peabodys is good for advetising something, then not delivering...they are
also good for crappy sound systems and people setting up rigs that dont hit

on the subs or setup a delay so everything hits together instead of

its not even that, its like everything they say now is ultra PC
and whatnot. public enemy were political without having to be
lovey to everyone.

its like they hit this idea you described with "check your head",
really perfected it on "ill communication", then it just started
to sound beat by "hello nasty". its the Beck syndrome: you can
only be so ironic and reference so much pop culture before your
music starts to be stupidly repetitive and bland. Beck fixed
himself by consistantly recording sraight up country/folk records
despite the general lack of financial gain by doing so.

"The suit claims the club infringed on the plaintiffs' copyrights by giving 
public performances of copyrighted songs on the club premises."

Performances? Were there actual performers or were they just playing the 
music?

"Plaintiffs are seeking between $750 and $30,000 in damages "

What damages?

"The suit also asks that the club be barred and permanently restrained from 
publicly performing the songs named in the suit."

What the fuck ever.

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Beastie's are def more tame now, but nevertheless still decent musically.

We should have a "footer" contest! The best one stays "up" for a month!

Here are my entries... (only 3 are allowed)
"My cock is bigger then Mt. Kilamonjaro!"

"If I was a bum, I'd shit in your hand and call it breakfast!"

"Those titties are dirty and filthy! You girls need to put cloth on
those things!"

ok, I'm drunk I think.

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is

High Contrast ( Hospital Records, Breakbeat Science) London UK

High Contrast is young Cardiff-based dj/producer Lincoln Barret, one of 
the leading artists in the soulful drum+bass scene. His music fuses many 
styles, from deep jazz to soundtracks, garage to disco. High Contrast 
reputation has ceaslessly gone from strength to strength, making colossal 
waves in the drum+bass scene. Most memorable are his latest releases "Make 
It Tonight", which received a caning from virtually every high profile dj 
in the drum+bass fraternity, and his superb reworkings of Hatiras' "Spaced 
Invader" and London Elektricity vs Robert Owens' "My Dreams". Lincoln is 
currently remixing a track for DJ Marky's next EP on V Recordings, and has 
been nominated for 3 gongs (Best Producer, Best Drum+Bass DJ and Best 
remix) at The Welsh Music Awards. Not many drum and bass artists can claim 
so much airplay on Radio One: not one Fabio+Grooverider radio show has 
gone by in the past few months without a High Contrast tune!

created music that has come to define the trends and styles of the day.  A

that globally represents San Francisco.  As Hawke, he has released two 
critically acclaimed albums, "Namaquadisco", and "Heatstroke".  As 
one-third of the famed Hardkiss trio, (with "brothers" Scott & Robbie 
Hardkiss), Gavin helped to create and encourage a spirited, psychedelic 
approach to music and life with genre-defying songs and DJ sets.  Gavin 
Hardkiss is a welcome anomaly in the electronic dance music world.  One of 
his most distinguishing traits is his fierce determination to create music 
that is durable and lasting.  His efforts are focused towards creating

Sat Mar 29                ANALOGUE HEAVEN MIDWEST V              NE Indiana

[not music, but gear related]

Analogue Heaven MidWest 2003

"The Voyager Home"
Official Information

The FIFTH annual AHMW get-together will be Saturday, March 29th at the 
PHHS Auditorium. I'll be there by 9:00 am. Who knows what time (or day) it 
will be when we're done :) All synthgeekgearheads are encouraged to join 
us and spend some time with awesome gear and great people.

AHMW 2003 is held in NE Indiana, midway between three empires of synth 
music: Detroit, Chicago, and... uh... Dayton!

MAP #1 shows the location relative to Interstate 69 and the Indiana Toll 
Road.
MAP #2 shows the close-up view of where to park for easy gear unloading.

Please bring a $5 - $10 "Free will" donation to help pay for auditorium 
rental

The exact address is 245 S 1150 E, Lagrange, IN 46795
If you need help getting here, just email me.
drew@ph.k12.in.us

What to bring:
* Your cool synths
* Long extension cords and power strips
* Audio cables, small mixer and headphones
* Camera!

With so many synths begging to be played, headphones are ideal for 
exploring all the different instruments people bring.
I have a PA for the performances. Anyone wishing to bring additional PA 
equipment will be welcomed to do so :)

Performances:
Live performances of all kinds are encouraged. There are plans underway to 
record them and burn AHMW2003 CD's.
We should probably try to sync up a jam session as well :)

Food:
We will collect orders and $ for lunch and dinner. Lunch will be 
sandwiches from the Lagrange Subway, and dinner will be Papa John's pizza. 
Feel free to bring your own if you wish. There are a couple nearby 
restaurants and gas stations, but not much. Angola and Lagrange have 
McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc. PHHS is a rural school.

Also, since this is a school building, consumption of alcohol on the 
grounds is illegal, and smoking is not permitted inside.


A few of the local motels would be:

Ramada Inn (R on map #1) North of Angola at I69 exit 154
$89 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9471
has restaurant, bar, indoor pool and sauna

This event brought to you by Experimedia Communications, Molotov Records, 
Headroom Digital, Shift Club Night, and Touch Supper Club.

"This is one of the most significant rosters I've ever observed to grace 
the area and it's even more taunting for me that I couldn't be there to 
support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're truly privileged to be 
offered such rare appearances courtesy of the event producers who're 
credited. Those responsible obviously share an increasingly rare 
enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast with most 'parties'. 
They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an intimate setting, thus 
providing an amazing opportunity to witness these talents whose impact is 
undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all involved and encourage 
anyone who can't stand 'the same' music being played at 'parties' to treat 
yourself to an evening of what is sure to be a great experience and 
hopefully an eye-opening impression on a few of you!"

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} hey!  don't play my music!

Florida is just weird. That should answer most questions.

There have been strings of busts where Karaoke DJ's have been playing
LICENSED discs, but they've all been busted on the fact that they were
playing material from ASCAP artists in clubs not registered with ASCAP. 

I could be mistaken, but I believe Lenny Kravitz wrote "Get the Party
Started" as performed by P!nk. I have a killer 12" remix of "There you
go" by P!nk, can you believe that it could be your ass going down as a
promoter if I play this song? Do note that I BOUGHT this through a UK
record store. Will the Unknown remixer go down? No, because it's much
easier to prosecute me. 

All of this COULD have been avoided if the clubs would have registered
themselves as an ASCAP venue, paid all sorts of exorbitant fees, and
alienated themselves from having any non-ASCAP musicians/dj's play.
Well, not really the alienation part, because as soon as you play in an
ASCAP club, that performance belongs to them. 

These organizaions have the power to do anything they damn well
please... Whether you know it or not, if you're a DJ or do Live PA,
you've probably got performances regulated by ASCAP. Artist
organizations like ASCAP are evil empires worse than the RIAA. They're
like labor unions once meant to promote the greater good for all those
it represents, now just corrupt criminals profiting off the backs of the
bruised. 

This is just BAD news for everyone. Or it can be good news for everyone
if worked correctly. Time will tell.

How good is this?  I mean, I actually like tha normal track, and I dont like 
much new hip-hop... due to Nelly and such... but I'd imagine theres a 
potential for this to be a hard fucking DnB cut.

its not even that, its like everything they say now is ultra PC

its like they hit this idea you described with "check your head",
really perfected it on "ill communication", then it just started
to sound beat by "hello nasty". its the Beck syndrome: you can
only be so ironic and reference so much pop culture before your
music starts to be stupidly repetitive and bland. Beck fixed
himself by consistantly recording sraight up country/folk records
despite the general lack of financial gain by doing so.

eh wot the hell, it's been awhile, heres ten or so i'm rockin the floor with:

Neon Skyline - Cyantific
Keep It Coming - Cookie Monsters
It's Love (Trippin') - Goldtrix vs. Matrix
13 Ghosts - Pollen
Mo' Fire (Andy C vs. Fresh mix) - Rawhill Kru
Back To Da Boogie - Krust, Die & Tali
Nitrous (Dillinja Rmx) - )EIB(
Shakedown (J Majik Remix) - Groove Armada
Love Story (B Key Remix) - Layo & Bushwacka
Delta 9 Rmx - Rascal & Klone
Deep in the Underground (Dj Hazard Rmx) - Drunken Masters
Shinobi - Fresh
Fusion Dance - Ill Skillz
T-Minus 10 - Distorted Minds (a bit boring, but a fucking monster when double dropped properly)


1 from teh past:

Origin Unknown - Speed of Sound Lp



fuck i think there's about ten more tunes i can add, so many good tunes about at the mo. oh and the new matrix & virus (bullet, hit the highway, trippin, puerto time, etc.) is makin my mouth water - fucking incredible.
and much respect to bc & rawhill. no 24 on the uk pop charts with Mo Fiya, and that doesn't count the thousands of 12 inches that are sold through independent outlets!





easy
majestic




ps. trout i will get around to giving you some feedback on the tunes, im a bit swamped with work, being the middle of tax season and all.

Subject: {pb-cle}  Therapy- THIS FRIDAY- Columbus, OH DJ Spettro- BSP




Greetings Pb-Cle massive.
Just a quick reminder about our monthly here in Columbus.
Fresh, underground House music at it's finest.  If any of you all 
would like to come and check it out, I have 5 guestlist spots to 
the first 5 people who e-mail me back.  This should be a great

we are pleased to bring you 
DJ SPETTRO(Dusttraxx,Aroma, Brique Rougue, Amenti, San Antonio, 
TX) 
www.spettromusic.com 


Spettro isn't a name you should watch for; it's a name you should 
know. If not, get thee to thyne local house purist and ask about 
his record "I Think I" on the Swirl People's label Aroma or 
his "Gotcha EP" on David Duriez's Brique Rouge label. You'll 
surely get an enthusiastic description of a straightforward dubbed 
house groove with Balearic guitars, smokin live percussion and 
some sweet n lovely vocal snippets. He has recently seen one of 
his tracks liscensed to Kinetinc records for use on the newest DJ 
DAN mix CD, and another to Defected for the latest JAY-J and 
MIGUEL MIGS(Naked Music) mix CD. 
Spettro has been featured in the "Hey DJ" section in URB Magazine 
(June 2002), and was featured in Austin's Feedback Magazine (July 
2002). His tracks have been reviewed in URB, DJ Mag, Feedback 
Magazine and endorsed on the charts of taste-maker djs like Mazi, 
Jay-J, Chris Lum, David Duriez, Murray Richardson, and Phil Weeks. 
Spettro has gained world wide respect as a hard working 
dj/producer with tracks out now on labels from 6 different 
countries including Bosh, Aquarius, Brique Rouge, Crack & Speed, 
and more coming this fall on Amenti, Chalant, Brique Rouge, and 
Simple Soul. He's also just signed a remix of a HARDKISS track to 
DERRICK CARTER'S seminal Classic Music label. Not surprisingly, 
our sources indicate that his best work has yet to come. 
To listen to a small mix on line, go to:

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} top 10

i know the amount of production going now with my cru is a direct result of 
us being pissed off that certain tracks just arent made availible...or when 
they are made availible it isnt the banging vip we heard in the club...or 
its been caned to death and by the time we get them the track has lost its 
appeal...so we make our shit...my crew isnt even bothering with fillers...we 
have just been making killers...i have seriously been in the studio 3 nites 
a week or more the past month and a half

as soon as i sort webspace ill be putting up a grip of tracks...

til then...if you wanna hear the new cleveland shit...come out to our anti 
funky charms/mikey's b-day/jakes send off party saturday nite...anyone 
interested hit me private stylee for directions

Sure,

You can czech my latest two promo tunes @ 
http://www.mp3.com/anonymous_informant

My latest mix is @ http://homepage.mac.com/skord/iMovieTheater9.html . 
Better check this only if you have broadband, as it's streaming @ 
44Khz. Spun some 60's modal and free jazz over some DnB that fit it, 
although they DnB tracks I put in the mix aren't ALL new. I'm having a 
hard time fitting new releases into my style.

I had a ton of wax reviews here, but for some reason my mail didn't 
send and this was all that was saved in the drafts. Well, if you 
haven't picked up "Swept Away - Swept Away" for both the A and B sides, 
you haven't heard the best trax this year. I'm to lazy to repeat the 
rest.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} top 10

My fav tracks as of the moment-

EZ-rollers-back to love
Keaton and Hive-Resolution/Plague
BSE vrs Concord Dawn-The sun
Tech Itch-The calling
Dom and Roland-Dynamo
Not that I have this tune but it definitely deserves some play 
out-Diotropics-Flounder <--Ariel produced this with his boy Tigga in DC.
Dylan-Fraggle Rock
Concord Dawn-Chameleon
Mathematics-Booty conspiracy
Still runnin on some old BC cuts
I dig Mo fire-I like the original remix by BAD C better unfortunately the 
Dillinja remix of nitrous is on there.  Boo on that.

Is that 10?  I lost count.

I won't be able to buy records until WHO knows when but one of them I will 
buy will be the squash vip.  I don't know I really like that tune A lot.  
Anyone else feeling it?  I know some might feel that the new synth added to 
the bassline might be a little cheesy but I LOVE IT!

Rock for that tune.

Concord DAWN tomorrow night in cincinnati at club 1120 on 1120 jackson 
street downtown cincy.

this is the tuuune! Seriously, I cant get over this track everytime i hear
it. Its definatly got a hook to it.

> Mathematics-Booty conspiracy

Alot of people seem to like the other cut on there. I forget what its called
off the top of my head, but boot conspiracy is a dope tune also.

Dylan's version of "be there for you" most definatly deserves props. I cant
wait for that to hit the shelf.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} top 10

various responses to all opf theese top tens:

1. nice to see so many locals making tracks, keep your peeled for a load of new bits by Pollen, his work has really paid off, his new tunes are blazin'! (fuck, i need to get back in the studio!)

2. squash vip - i guess i could add that too my top ten. i was already at 15 or so though, and could have added at least another ten tunes. 2003 is set to massive!

3. mo fire -andy c & fresh mix is heavy! tune rinces out sooooooo nicley with anything, so much energy in a mix. a fusion of fresh's "boomerang" dubplate, andy's energetic beats & navi's ruffneck vocals. pure bliss!
and the original - mad to double drop!

4. dylan - not so sure about that be there for you stuff, it's all right, not so much my cup of tea though. more lookling forward to house nation, that disco monster!!!! and his new hip-hop beats are sooooooo on point!

5. let's see more of this top ten biz! love to see what everyone else is feeling. dnb is pretty much all i keep up on so it would be nice to see some other genre's as well, give's me some sort of reference point to being listening to new stuff in other genre's


Hey Jes this one's for you ;-)

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!

HAHA

Pure Noise (Uberdark Mix)

influences.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FUNKY CHARMS 4 TIMESLOTS!

    what happened to 1 auxy? i saw him on the
    flyer, i am on the phone with him now and he
    says he never heard anything funky charms
    four until now.

    he did say that he would play, but you would
    have to pay him double :p

    you should give him a call or something next
    time you book him.

the last I had talked to him he'd expressed interest in playing (though this WAS some time ago) and the contact information that we had turned out to be out of date. We were ultimately unable to get in touch with him, but with many weeks left until the event (at the time) we were confident that we'd be able to reach him and felt that he would have been disappointed if we had left him off of the flyer because he's always been an integral part of the show. If there is even the most remote possibility that he can make it out, PLEASE e-mail me with his contact info so we can make the neccesary arangements to have him rock the crowd as we'd anticipated, hopefully tomorrow night so that we can give the good word to those who've been under the impression that he won't be spinning; his performance will make the show so much more complete. Thank you so much in advance!

Subject: {pb-cle} Paging: Jason C

I am paging Jason "I am the staff, which means I'm a bitch!" C. I don't have 
his e-mail addy on hand, even though he posts here at least once a week.

I'm sure he'll get this and respond...thanks

What a horrible night to have a curse.

Subject: {pb-cle} WMC?

I don't think I've seen a thread on anyone from this area heading to WMC in
Miami FL next week...
Anyone going? I know Curt is...
If anyone is, and is looking for a pb-cle meetup, may I suggest doing so at
Flute Bar at 500 South Pointe Dr Miami Beach on Friday night ... We
confirmed earlier in the week that David (aka Deviant from ::TRUE:: Fridays
here in Cleveland) is spinning there on Friday with Ian Shearson (from HR
Connecticut). We have a West Coast house headliner in the works, but can't
announce it and get it on the party list until he's got all his paperwork
and legalese worked out with his folks...We'll put it on the site when all
is confirmed (www.headrushmusic.com) Anyway, a round of drinks on us for
anyone who wants to come out. Hit me up with a PM.
What parties is everyone looking forward to there? Of course Tenaglia's
marathon set (which is on TUESDAY this year---he's trying to kill us at the
beginning of the week!), the Balance Promote (www.balancepromote.com) party
at Space on Thursday, Ultrafest on Saturday are some of the big highlights
... The party list seems to be longer this year. www.masterpartylist.com and
keeps growing everytime I look at it. Last time I printed it, it was 64
pages!
Have fun and be safe!

Ah...

the parties I want to attend that I will have to miss are:

A)  Monday's Soulfuric Party with John Julius Knight

B)  Thursday's OM part with MARQUESS WYATT!!!!!!!!!, Farina & Others.

C)  Friday's naked music/astralwerks party with Miguel Migs, Audio Bullys,
and Royksopp.

I was also going try to check out the subliminal party,  at least one dust
trax event, and any of the cooler small non-bar orientated events.  Some of
the poolsides are starting to look sweet.

ARGHHH... I hate each and every one of you who are going, you all just suck.
(J/K, I'm insanely jealous and expect lots of pictures).

  Ah...

  the parties I want to attend that I will have to miss are:

  A)  Monday's Soulfuric Party with John Julius Knight

  B)  Thursday's OM part with MARQUESS WYATT!!!!!!!!!, Farina & Others.

  C)  Friday's naked music/astralwerks party with Miguel Migs, Audio
Bullys,
  and Royksopp.

  I was also going try to check out the subliminal party,  at least one
dust
  trax event, and any of the cooler small non-bar orientated events.
Some of
  the poolsides are starting to look sweet.

  ARGHHH... I hate each and every one of you who are going, you all just
suck.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} WMC?

I'd love to do a net meet just to sit back and collectively enjoy how
warm it'll be in Miami... the bad news is that this is my Friday night:

LIME BAR, MAZE, & THE ROOM:    MAGNETIK / MUZIKA present John Creamer,
Stephane K., Peace Division, Scumfrog, DJ Vibe, Tiger Hook Corp., Low
End Specialists, Lexicon Avenue,  Kazell, James Holden, Ashley Caselle,
Jody (Way Out West), Leama, Pete "the shaker" Bones, Leama, 16b,
Tarentella, Luke Fair, Mv Envy, Desyn Masiello and more!!  
[9pm - 7am]




I don't have anything scheduled for Sunday save sleep (there's a pretty
distinct possibility that I'll be working relatively nonstop from Friday
night to Sunday morning, with a flight for Las Vegas heading out on
Tuesday.  If anyone's still around Monday that's perfect.

If not:

Tuesday I've got a daytime, Wedensday I don't.  Thursday I have no
daytime and no nighttime (yet).  Friday I probably have a guest spot @ a
daytime (Astralwerks) and then the above Friday night.


James

I don't think I've seen a thread on anyone from this area heading to WMC
in
Miami FL next week...
Anyone going? I know Curt is...
If anyone is, and is looking for a pb-cle meetup, may I suggest doing so
at
Flute Bar at 500 South Pointe Dr Miami Beach on Friday night ... We
confirmed earlier in the week that David (aka Deviant from ::TRUE::
Fridays
here in Cleveland) is spinning there on Friday with Ian Shearson (from
HR
Connecticut). We have a West Coast house headliner in the works, but
can't
announce it and get it on the party list until he's got all his
paperwork
and legalese worked out with his folks...We'll put it on the site when
all
is confirmed (www.headrushmusic.com) Anyway, a round of drinks on us for
anyone who wants to come out. Hit me up with a PM.
What parties is everyone looking forward to there? Of course Tenaglia's
marathon set (which is on TUESDAY this year---he's trying to kill us at
the
beginning of the week!), the Balance Promote (www.balancepromote.com)
party
at Space on Thursday, Ultrafest on Saturday are some of the big
highlights
... The party list seems to be longer this year. www.masterpartylist.com
and
keeps growing everytime I look at it. Last time I printed it, it was 64
pages!
Have fun and be safe!

Subject: {pb-cle} FC4 day 2 review

Not many messages today...  Everyone must still be sleeping.  At any 
rate I was able to make it day 2 of FC at metropolis.  If the sound 
is still in-house, they really revamped it compared to what it was 
before.  There also seemed to be more lights then before.  I saw 
cards for some sound crew, so I'm guessing it's theirs.  Anywho, it 
was nice.  Music was great, too.  Although it seemed that main stage 
was having intermittent sound problems with mics and clippage and 
stuff, only happened a couple times.

Spent most of the time in the VIP room, it had this "chill roomish" 
feel to it.  I know it wasn't really a chill room, I've never 
actually been to a party with a real one, but it had the same feel to 
it as what I would imagine a chill room to be.  Mainly 
house/downtempo stuff and it was low enough that you could take out 
your ear plugs and have some sort of a conversation.  Although I 
think I left my ear plug case in there somewhere, ohh well.

I think I've complained about this before, but they didn't let people 
bring cameras in, which I thought was pretty lame.  Then once I got 
in there, there were a couple people with cameras and there was even 
someone with a camcorder *sigh* ohh well.

Security was better, mainly the one dude that I didn't like doesn't 
seem to be there anymore.

Now I know why so many people die from fires in clubs.  I was in the 
VIP room when I started hearing this buzzing noise, figured it was 
part of the song and didn't really think about, till I saw the strobe 
for the fire alarm.  So that was going off for a few minutes and i 
walked out in the main room and after a few more minutes I saw 
security people running around.  I doubt most people even noticed it.

All in all it was a good night, looks like the FC crew definitely 
have something going.  Lets just hope things don't "blow up."

Subject: {pb-cle} Chraze Commercial for WMC???

So I watching Mr. Hell tonight with Ket (for those of you who haven't seen
it, it's a cartoon on Showtime , it's extremely witty and funny). 
Anyways, tonight's episode was about parties...and it ended, there was a
commercial with DJ Craze talking about WMC, and how he got into drum n
bass and all sorts of sillyness.  And at the very end, his message was
"Don't let your friends drink and spin".  I laughed my ass off.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} top 10

whatever brah...when i dropped that on saturday nite it blew up the
club....i was dropping all kinds of fresh vinyl that i bought 6hours before
and dubs...and that track did the most damage

as far as bootlegs go that is probably the best in a long while...50's voice
isnt pitched to sound like alvin and the chipmunks, and the orginal vibe of
the hiphop track is still there

did i mention it blew up the club???

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} WHO's That dude?

I know all about this dude, his presence on your wall has bothered me
for all time. We've even made bets on when people will notice him the
first time they come over. It bugged me, so I found out his story...

This dude was adopted by this man: Tito Leland. He's a small time gun
runner and rave party promoter. So he gets "This dude" into going to
parties. Next thing you know, this dude is good... he's DAMN good. But
then he had the party of his life. Pinned against him and his DJ brother
Nibbles. And this dude said "No man, I can't dance to that, that's my
brother Nibbles". And they made him dance anyway. And This dude DANCED.
"That's it" this dude said, then he started doing crack and wigged out.
Shortly after this photo was taken, he collapsed in a rage. His heart
would no longer beat. 

BTW yo... You should put up your "funky charms" photos and see if anyone
can tell the difference.

Aw hell.  I hate it when there's so much going on during the same weekend.  Went to see Mazi at Merc and Abbasso instead of Satoshi (which still was phenomenal !!!), but still would have loved to hear Tomiie play (esp. after all the reviews I've heard from friends)  
Never know what to expect @ Moda as to vibe, etc.......very cool to hear Satoshi played what one would expect of his caliber, and did not lower his standards, or blow it off.

For those who don't know, the abbasso faithful got a
bit of a treat on sat. eve.  mazi came down and
chilled out for a while after he was finished at
mercury, and naps and crew talked him into spinning
for a bit...he ended bumping out a few deeper records
than what he was spinning at mercury for an hour or
so.  he's an awesome house dj and one incredibly chill
individual...if anyone gets the chance to see him i
highly suggest it.

Oh yeah, guess I never mentioned that Mazi spun at Abbasso too.   And just in case anyone thought otherwise, I in no way wanted to slight Mazi by saying I wish I could've heard Satoshi.... Mazi was off the hook, mad cool, and made my night!  Just wish there was some way to have heard both.  
Given the choice still, despite how awesome Satoshi played....Mazi was such a cool guy....I'd choose to do the same again.

individual...if anyone gets the chance to see him i
highly suggest it.

"and he didn't compromise ;)"

He did play a Michael Jackson remix around 2:45.   I thought it was dope,
but the context in which is was used seemed to be right on.

HOWEVER, when others at Moda have been criticized for playing MJ.

Personally, I don't get it.  Who gives a fuck what gets played as long as it
make sense or is a unique presentation of something old.

Oh... and Sammy played a DOPE record that sampled Din Daa Daa - I hope you
got to catch that, it was tastey.

He actually played two MJ "remixes"... one earlier, with samples from
Billy Jean. He rocked it though! Very technical and very, very smooth...
held the dance floor the entire night! Definitely a treat!
Jazzanova on the other hand... no comment.

Jazzadoodoo? It was one dude, and he was horrible... didn't just clear
the dance floor on many occasions, but literally sent people out the
door. Didn't mix, and his track selection was garbage. He did play a few
choice tracks, and would start to get the groove going, but then would
slam in some track that would kill it, and clear the floor. I missed
Jazzanova last time they were here, and I guess there were two of them,
and the crowd was very thick. But there really weren't that many people
this time, and only one dude was there.

when i saw them in september at touch, there was 2 of them (and 
since of the 6 of them, only 2 are deejays one had to be the guy 
you saw) and they were both flawless. they played a mix of house, 
broken beat, jungle, dub, hiphop, jazz, whatever. not every mix 
was beatmatched, since obviously that would be impossible with 
that kind of varying tempo, but every mix was perfectly placed and 
flawlessly executed, people went wild every time a new style hit 
the decks. that was probably the best most eclectic deejay set ive 
ever seen.

I left at one...did it keep going downhill after that
missy elliot track?  up to the missy elliot track i
thought the music was decent, except for one cd that
skipped.  I honestly wasn't expecting mixing...the
guys on nitty gritty nights seem to be more hip-hop
oriented - I see a lot more people there
scratch-and-drop than mix like house dj's...maybe my
expectations should be higher?  Not much of a crowd,
either - perhaps there was just too much good shit
this weekend.  Two mj remixes for satoshie, eh?  too
bad (i am not, never have been, and never will be one
to enjoy mj's music) still wish i could've seen both
he and mazi regardless

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Satoshi Tomiie

There was not an ounce of compromise in Satoshi's set, which I can't always say for other big names I've gone out to see at Moda.  The crowd was for the most part eating it up, though.  Very refreshing....

Oh, and as a testament to the sound, I was in la la land dancing to a really cool, deep track when I opened my eyes and Satoshi was standing next to me on the main floor soaking up the sound system.  Props to Moda.

Wished I could have made it out for Mazi too... maybe in April.  His website says he's coming back to Cleveland April 4.  Does anyone know if that's at Mercury again?

no moreso than not differentiating between a personal
preferance and an attempt to discredit an artist's
work.  mj's talent and influence on the musical
landscape, particularly in the 80's are irrefutable,
and to deny that would be 'fucking stupid'  i respect
his talent and contributions, but i simply do not
enjoy listening to his music.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Satoshi Tomiie

I have no problem with a dj not beatmatching every record, when he is
assembling an eclectic set. Mr. Scruff last fall for instance, f'ing
blew me away!!! He was amazing! But he did mix and blend his set to keep
the floor moving, as well as educated, until like 3am.
Dude from Jazzanova, shouldn't even carry that name if you ask me, was
all over the board, and didn't keep a consistent flow. He played some
great broken beat tracks, some jungle, some nice hip-hop, and whatever
else he could mingle, but didn't keep it moving. Perhaps it was the
other dude's influence that carried it the last time, but this guy
should just stick to producing. Another case of good producer, shit dj.

when i saw them in september at touch, there was 2 of them (and 
since of the 6 of them, only 2 are deejays one had to be the guy 
you saw) and they were both flawless. they played a mix of house, 
broken beat, jungle, dub, hiphop, jazz, whatever. not every mix 
was beatmatched, since obviously that would be impossible with 
that kind of varying tempo, but every mix was perfectly placed and 
flawlessly executed, people went wild every time a new style hit 
the decks. that was probably the best most eclectic deejay set ive 
ever seen.

regarding jazzanova:

I didn't venture downstairs to see what you were talking about at that
point, but I don't certainly think he was the worst dj I have ever heard.  I
was digging what he was doing, and I lost track of time.  There were parts
where I was bored, and other parts where I was really feeling it - though
the parts where I was bored might have been someonelse favorite spot - ya
know?

I think the vibe of the room required him to be all over the place... it
could have been that he made a judgement call to do it that way, ya know?
If he would have stayed in one sound or the other more people might have
left then by jumping around so dramatically. I know others were at the show,
so I'd be curious to hear what they have to say.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} track id

The track is called Don't Lie on Hooj Choons by Sharam Jey and Nick K.  
There are a total of 3 versions of the track on 2 records.  The first one is 
called Don't Lie, and the second one is called Don't Lie...Again.
It also has the sample of Debo saying "Don't Lie" on it.

I'd say middle of the road for me....not great, not bad.  He WAS all over the place.  I did catch several times where I had to stop dancing and figure out just where the heck he was going with things...and I rarely ever stop dancing to do that.  
Some good chill records though (exception Missy Elliot)....
Personally however, I actually think I enjoyed Jude's opening set more.  
But Jurgen was alright(that was Jurgen right??)---left pretty early though (1:00 ish....so can't speak for the entire eve.)

Indeed.  Jude was rockin'

Question:
What is the difference between Public Enemy & Missy Elliot?  13-14 years?

I _like_ that bootleg of Missy, and props to Jurgen for playing it because
few others could get away it.

I would imagine in 13-14 years if someone drops Missy, it would be
considered tight too????

 Amen.  Anyone else notice the dub track with the
 baseline from the clash's "the guns of brixton" (the
 clash may have stolen the line from 60's reggae
 outfit, but that's what I know it from)?

 I actually like the original missy elliot song.  she
 seems like one of the more innovative hip-hop
 producers out there now and even though i'm not a
 huge hip-hop fan her music is fun to listen to. I   
 didn't
 like that bootleg on account of the fact that the
 vocal speed was jacked way up to match the tempo of
 the song...i heard a breaks version online recently
 that was the same...at the original tempo the song
 sounds cool, at the tempo of those remixes it sounds
 kind of spastic to my ear and not exactly what i'd
 consider to be enjoyable.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Jazzanova (was Satoshi Tommiee)

jugoe was excellent - great track selection - i wish he would have played
all night.  he held it down perfectly and even worked in a dj dsl tune.

jurgen jazzanova started off with some good downtempo straight off of jude's
set, but didn't flow from one style to another like a practiced dj should,
seamlessly.  but whatever...i'm so starved for good downtempo coming thru
good a good sound system that's not in my store or living room, i'll take
what i can get.  people weren't feeling the bossa too much, it seemed.  he
came back a few times, but lost people in between...agreed.

if i can convince kevin and the ed um to get on board, i think i'm going to
get a monthly going here - that's probably the only way i'd do it, with
those two as residents.  i might just be woozy from all the excitement last
night too...don't quote me ;p

ass kicking thing they have going there in cleveland.  quantic in 2 weeks,
dj smash later this summer.  big up to the nitty gritty guys - thanks shawn
and jude and crew for working it out.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} FC4 day 2 review

Thanks for your post on the event. Being the owner of Metropolis I
appreciate an honest review. A few things, yes the sound system has had
additions put to it. I flew 4 more additional TurboSound TMS-3's on the
other corners of the dance floor, along with updating the majority of the
Crown MA3600's with MA5000's. The lighting has also been updated. We now
have a total of 20 intelligent fixtures, 20 dataflash, 2 Diversitronix
strobes, 3 fogger systems, and alot of little lighting things here and
there! The problem with the mics had nothing to do with my gear. They
brought in their own mic mixer, wireless mics, etc and plugged it into the
Pioneer DJM600's mic input. Their mixer was buzzing and clipping like crazy,
the mics were also VERY low quality.
 As far as camera's that also is not our policy. Funky Charms promoter must
have set standards for the security they brought in. I know that when I
purchased the place we had major issues with the security almost everyone
hated. The previous owner let them have the run of the club and do what they
wanted. And I know you all hated the bald headed muscle door guy the most.
Strip searching people for no reason was NEVER our policy and they were let
go when we were able to replace them. We had a legal reason why they had to
stay for the first month we purchased the place  I know the bouncers was the
major reason most people stopped coming there! I  had to apologize and comp
drinks to way to many people for their strip search anyone for any reason
policy.

I want to thank all of you who did come out. I hope we were able to kind of
showcase the club to you all again and make everyone feel welcome. As I
stated the security brought in was 80% the promotors security people and
they were kinda tough at the door. I myself had trouble coming back in at
10:00pm after being there during setup!
As far as the fire alarm, someone turned the wrong knob on the dance floor
fogger and the fog got so dense that it tripped the ventilation sensor {at
least it works!}

babble babble babble... sorry for the long letter...
Thanks again, hope to see many of you soon

Jim
Metropolis NightClub

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} rebirth roll call

    we were planning on it.

    however, the last time we went to rebirth,
    i went to work the next day drunk. sorta like
    i am today. i just blew a .117. ouch...

    it depends on how the day goes whether we
    are going to make it out or not tonight.

    not too sure if i'm getting too old for this shit or
    not.

He may have meant it like it sounded. He may like boys. Whatever floats

Homophobes are the ones with the complex. I vote for 80% of all men to turn 
gay. That leaves us straight ones with a pretty good situation.

Stay Gay.

Hearing a guy referred to as a DJ whore by another male just still strikes

Subject: {pb-cle} Jazzanova last Sunday

Hey crew...

I wanted to just thank everyone who came out last Sunday to our special installment of Nitty Gritty for the Jazzanova show. It's always cool to see the regular faces that support all the time. Also, it was nice to see new faces and hear that some people drove from all over the region to come check it out. That's f'in amazing. Thanks for partying with us because if it wasn't for people like you we wouldn't be able to continually bring new diverse talent to the area. 

In response to some of the criticism for Jurgen from Jazzanova...we can't always bat 100% on these shows but we try. It was a great night. Not everyone can be full on all the time though. He rocked it last time he came here with Claas Brieler. And to the person who said that he doesn't deserve to carry the Jazzanova name??...he's part of the Jazzanova collective...so why shouldn't he? About how he was all over different genres, Jazzanova is known for the diversity of styles they cross. Last year when they were here they played D&B, funk, latin, soul, house, broken beat, hip-hop, etc too. That's part of the attraction. I think alot of people get tired of the same old same old all the time. I loved it. 

The crowd was thin early, but filled up nicely around midnight. The downstairs was pretty packed and the upstairs was about a third filled. It thinned a little earlier than usual, but the hard core heads stayed and danced all night. I think alot of people were concentrating on St Patty's Day. Thanks to all those who appreciated the party! 

We're going to keep throwing parties for serious party people and bringing talent that would never usually come here. Look for more diverse producer/djs on the soulful side of the spectrum. Hopefully, you will continue to come and dance with other like minded people just looking for a good time. 

Hope to see you all there in two weeks (Sat. Apr. 5) for our ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY with Quantic & Rob Luis from Tru Thoughts UK. May 3 will be Smash from Blue Note. June will be Farid from 18th St. Lounge. July will be Dynamo Productions with Andy Smith (Portishead). 

Thanks,
Shawn

Shawn,
 My criticism was by no means any diss to On Point or Nitty Gritty,
continue doing the top notch events that you have been keeping up with
over the last year!! It's a great night that you have going on, and I
always enjoy coming out! 
 The reason I said that he shouldn't carry the name, is the same reason
I would say it if Roni Size, Krust, Suv, or Die, were to play out and
use the "Reprazent" title. I think he should DJ as Jurgen of Jazzanova,
not as "Jazzanova." Whichever way he chooses to use the name is his
business, but I thought it was a bad reflection on the group.
 I did have a good time at the show! Keep up the good work!

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} FC4 day 2 review

I thought that when the new owner took over the place late last year the
problem with the gestapo security was supposed to be fixed.  I guess
that was just a bunch of BS.  I guess that's just the Cleveland way
though.  When I was in Buffalo for a NYE party I couldn't believe it
when the bouncer at the door was actually nice to me.

How could you NOT have known about the strip searching? They did
almost that to poor Henry last year!

Depends where you go, some security dudes I can carry a little 
conversation while wating in line, then there are some that you don't 
even want to look straight in the face in fear that they will take 
that as some threat :)

any records by godspeed you black emperor, pan american, one speed bike, do 
make say think (basically the whole constellation records family).

the NEWEST record by black dice (beaches and crayons) is really, really good 
studying music.  don't get any of the old 7"s or lps though, they will blow 
your brain up.

I think Jazzanova has a new disc coming out next week you may want to
pick that up. 

Lately I've been listening to the following in my shallow walled cube:

The Orb - Back to mine
Massive Attack - 100th Window
FC Kahuna - Machine says yes
OM Lounge 7 
Kaskade - It's you it's me <<< haven't heard this yet but im sure it
won't disappoint
V.A. OM 100
Zero 7 - Anotherlatenight
Jazzanova - In between


I think the lady that sits next me thinks I've lost my mind. But I'm not
the one listening to Christian Death Metal.

Right.  I guess I can't complain too much.  The security didn't trouble
me much.  I guess I'm just a bit bitter because I couldn't bring my
camera in.  One of the main things I like to do at parties is take
pictures.  I still don't understand the reasoning behind that rule...

read his email again

the door security and 80% of total security were not the owner's 
guys.

he did take care of the "gestapo security" from what it sounds.

First off I would like to thank Alien Gonzalez for pulling some strings
and helping me get my camera in. I was supposed to get pictures of him
but missed his set because I was distracted by Pb-Clevers in the VIP
room. I put all the blame on Marisa and Amanda they are nothing but
trouble. 
 
I was really impressed with the turnout at FC4 and the number of people
dancing all night long till the very end.

Subject: {pb-cle} Funky Charms 4 - Day 1

I would have to say that is one of the best parties I ever been to.  Some of 
you bitch about the whole club thing, but the crew did an awsome job keeping 
an underground feel thru out the Friday night venu.  When you been in the 
scene sense the begining your done going to parties that have the 
possibility of getting busted.  You just get to a point where you want to go 
and have a good time without the bull shit.   I give you guys full props.  
It was also nice to see Funky Charms in new Venu's and locations.

For everyone that missed my set or did not receive the 100+ demos I handed 
out you can listen to it online at: 
http://www.transparentproduction.com/dj.html 

The name of the CD is Creation.  Named after a party in a warehouse next to 
what used to be U4ia.  Was one of the best times I ever had.  If anyone has 
any pics of this party please give me a link to it.  I believe the party was 
in 95-96.   DJ Hardware was one of the headliners. 

Thanks for a great weekend.

Creation was a great time! It was Teknova's first event. I have a copy
of the flyer if you want me to send it your way let me know.

I was really impressed with the turnout at FC4 and the number of people
dancing all night long till the very end.

any records by godspeed you black emperor, pan american, one speed bike, do 
make say think (basically the whole constellation records family).

the NEWEST record by black dice (beaches and crayons) is really, really good 
studying music.  don't get any of the old 7"s or lps though, they will blow 
your brain up.

well high contrast was fucking amazing. he is only one of a handfull of dnb  producers that can actually mix well.  his track selection was brilliant & breathtaking.  such a well rounded set, and omg sooooooo many good tunes.  all of the liquid producers are really pushing their sound to the next level. played some new bits by himself (papa nu guinea remix & renegade snares remix), m.i.s.t. (outer space :love: & some other ones w/o names yet), cyantific, johnny l (let's roll :tune!:), dillinja, matrix, and others. without a doubt one of the top 5 dnb artists i've seen mix it up live. one more thing - for only being nineteen yrs old, his new tunes show experience and depth so far beyond that it's amazing.

as far as the crowd, all of 32 people showed up.  i don't know. people just don't get it i guess.  does anybody actually take the time to educate themselves and support a music that everyone claims to love so much?  i know it wasn't because of lack of advertising, we worked our asses of trying to get the word out about this show. everytime i think things are starting to turn around in this area, something like this goes down. i don't know, makes me wonder if i should even waste my time putting this much effort into something. 

really reminded me of dnb events five years ago so, when the dark sounds were first starting to break through. nobody would come out and support, cause all anybody wanted to hear was the jump-up & aphrodite's wank hip-hop remixes.  now nobody comes out unless it's the dark producers.  even thought the entire rest of the dnb scene is moving on to a new level of musicallity & composition. just like ohio to be running 5 years behind the rest of the pack.  no wonder all of our top producers and dj's are running of to other states to get noticed. oh well, i know this arguement is pretty useless, but at least i got it off my chest.  biggup to those 32 that know the score!

    ok, i suck. we went out and got far too trashed
    the night before.

    it really sucks when work comes early the next
    morning.

    i know we would be more inclined to come out
    if the headliners went on at midnight, rather than
    one.

    i know, we're wimps...

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} high contrast review? ray g's a pimp

I dunno, I live in Columbus. I would have loved to make it, but driving
out after work the 2 1/2 hours to Kent, and waking up at 4 in the
morning to make it back here to get to work on time seems like...
like... a hassle. I mean, I'd have to start driving back here right
after the show. The only thing that would have made it worth it is to
give my KSU attending brother a noogie. 

People will seriously go out of their way to see a cool act, I haven't
been out since Goldie @ Heaven & Earth (my job is killin me), but there
were people from all over there. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think
that was a Friday. I wanted to czech DJ Storm out, but that was on a
Sunday night. 

OOOOOOH, BUT PEOPLE LOVE THE MUUUUUSIC, THEY COME OUT FOR THE MUUUUUSIC.
No, and they don't come out for the PLUR. They come out to escape for a
few hours from whatever the hell they are doing all week. I mean, how
many people in Ohio even know who High Contrast is? Only a small amount
I'm sure. And how many are going to come see him on a Tuesday night an
hour drive from most Metropolitan areas at least?

There's a big difference between promotion and planning. 

Local labels have a HUGE advantage over labels like Hospital, who do not
cater to United States audiences at all. It's not that you're not doing
your job as a promoter, it's that the promoter is just a tiny piece of
the puzzle and the rest of the pieces are missing. It's not your job to
make sure that everyone knows who High Contrast is. I'm sure there are
people out there who's jaw would DROP if they heard his tracks. In fact,
my parents have my latest mix and they're like DnB freaks now. 

As much distaste as there is for the commercialization of music, there's
a reason that commercial music works. There are people out there who
have no idea who High Contrast is, never have stepped foot in a indy
music store, and don't go clubbing because they have no idea what it's
all about. In 99/100 people's schedules, it's easier to turn on the
radio and hear some pop crap that is a musical "comprimise". I think the
Silverraver put it best to me when descibing "oldies" music once -- it's
not that anyone LIKES it, it's that no one really detests it. 

Forget about the latest releases coming from the UK, when they come, if
they come. Forget about their producers and DJ's until they comply by
getting major releases into wal-mart (or even wal*mart), getting airplay
on major radio stations during peak hours, etc. You're all working too
hard to have 30 people show up, and it's not your fault. 

This is where the Locals come in. The people who CAN promote in the way
that new media companies should, and are capable of what overseas talent
is unwilling to do here. 

This is a business that has nearly nothing to do with music. Until
people are willing to treat it like the rest of the industry is doing
with their Linkin Bizkits and Brittney Backsync's, it will just die. I'm
sure I'm pissing off a ton of people by saying these things (haha, who's
read this far?), but until someone is willing to not call this music
"dance music", it's not worth a dime. 

You have to generate value to your music before anyone is willing to
pick it up to get airplay, shelf space, soundtracked, get it in a game,
etc etc. A lot of this is chicken in egg, but I guarantee that any
european label hasn't given a thought to breaking it big stateside this
way. This doesn't cheapen the experience any, it is plainly stated the
only way that people will get exposure to it for the first time. And
when these things fall into place, it'll be the only way that promoters
will be able to succeed, and to be able to say "I was there first
maaaan". 

I am an evil genius who will surprise y'all someday soon.

well high contrast was fucking amazing. he is only one of a handfull of
dnb  producers that can actually mix well.  his track selection was
brilliant & breathtaking.  such a well rounded set, and omg sooooooo
many good tunes.  all of the liquid producers are really pushing their
sound to the next level. played some new bits by himself (papa nu guinea
remix & renegade snares remix), m.i.s.t. (outer space :love: & some
other ones w/o names yet), cyantific, johnny l (let's roll :tune!:),
dillinja, matrix, and others. without a doubt one of the top 5 dnb
artists i've seen mix it up live. one more thing - for only being
nineteen yrs old, his new tunes show experience and depth so far beyond
that it's amazing.

as far as the crowd, all of 32 people showed up.  i don't know. people
just don't get it i guess.  does anybody actually take the time to
educate themselves and support a music that everyone claims to love so
much?  i know it wasn't because of lack of advertising, we worked our
asses of trying to get the word out about this show. everytime i think
things are starting to turn around in this area, something like this
goes down. i don't know, makes me wonder if i should even waste my time
putting this much effort into something. 

really reminded me of dnb events five years ago so, when the dark sounds
were first starting to break through. nobody would come out and support,
cause all anybody wanted to hear was the jump-up & aphrodite's wank
hip-hop remixes.  now nobody comes out unless it's the dark producers.
even thought the entire rest of the dnb scene is moving on to a new
level of musicallity & composition. just like ohio to be running 5 years
behind the rest of the pack.  no wonder all of our top producers and
dj's are running of to other states to get noticed. oh well, i know this
arguement is pretty useless, but at least i got it off my chest.  biggup

yeah wtf?  i drove two hours to go see the man.  it was well worth the trip
tho.  not only did h.c. throw down one of the nicest sets ive heard in a
while but majestic and jealeigh were on point too.  i cant wrap my head
around the turnout problem.  the local talent around here is quality.  these
places should be packed just to see them.  dont give up george, just be like
me, concentrate on writing originals.  fuck djing!

but again, big upz to the 32 cool people in kent.  i had fun regardless.

> well high contrast was fucking amazing. he is only one of a handfull of
dnb producers that can actually mix well. his track selection was brilliant
& breathtaking. such a well rounded set, and omg sooooooo many good tunes.
all of the liquid producers are really pushing their sound to the next
level. played some new bits by himself (papa nu guinea remix & renegade
snares remix), m.i.s.t. (outer space :love: & some other ones w/o names
yet), cyantific, johnny l (let's roll :tune!:), dillinja, matrix, and
others. without a doubt one of the top 5 dnb artists i've seen mix it up
live. one more thing - for only being nineteen yrs old, his new tunes show
experience and depth so far beyond that it's amazing.
>
> as far as the crowd, all of 32 people showed up. i don't know. people just
don't get it i guess. does anybody actually take the time to educate
themselves and support a music that everyone claims to love so much? i know
it wasn't because of lack of advertising, we worked our asses of trying to
get the word out about this show. everytime i think things are starting to
turn around in this area, something like this goes down. i don't know, makes
me wonder if i should even waste my time putting this much effort into
something.

> really reminded me of dnb events five years ago so, when the dark sounds
were first starting to break through. nobody would come out and support,
cause all anybody wanted to hear was the jump-up & aphrodite's wank hip-hop
remixes. now nobody comes out unless it's the dark producers. even thought
the entire rest of the dnb scene is moving on to a new level of musicallity
& composition. just like ohio to be running 5 years behind the rest of the
pack. no wonder all of our top producers and dj's are running of to other
states to get noticed. oh well, i know this arguement is pretty useless, but
at least i got it off my chest. biggup to those 32 that know the score!

I agree with this...  For people that have to work, staying out until 2:30 to 
see a headliner just doesn't work out well.  It would make more sense to have 
them on ealier on a weeknight.

Know many of you have seen posts about Local Thursdays @ Abbasso before....

but I don't have to work @ 7:00 this Friday morning(yeah!)...and I want a PARTY Thursday night, so I'm posting a reminder---- go out and support! 

It's open tables...get there early to sign up for a slot if you wanna spin.  

Honestly, if you've never been...it's often a really great night.  

Anybody in????  Come on,  I usually go until 12:30 am at LEAST, and get up the next day...so no excuses. LOL.  ; )

Check http://www.duderememberthatparty.com/ for details on the event.  Its listed as Southwest Ohio, so most likely it'll be in Dayton...should be a really good show with lots of good DnB talent.  I think beyond Tech Itch and Dom & Roland, the rest of the lineup they've announced is Ruckus, Mellowman, Dioptrics(Ariel and Dega) and Voigt-Kampff.

-=-=-=---------------------------------------------------------------=-=-=-

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
subscribe/unsubscribe:  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/subscribe/
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.
I reserve the right to put annoying twits in my .killfile

please don't email me asking for more info.  what is listed here is what i
have been given.  if an infoline doesn't work, assume the promoter is
an idiot.

Hardkiss), Gavin helped to create and encourage a spirited, psychedelic 
approach to music and life with genre-defying songs and DJ sets.  Gavin 
Hardkiss is a welcome anomaly in the electronic dance music world.  One of

Sat Mar 29                ANALOGUE HEAVEN MIDWEST V              NE Indiana

[not music, but gear related]

Analogue Heaven MidWest 2003

"The Voyager Home"
Official Information

The FIFTH annual AHMW get-together will be Saturday, March 29th at the 
PHHS Auditorium. I'll be there by 9:00 am. Who knows what time (or day) it 
will be when we're done :) All synthgeekgearheads are encouraged to join 
us and spend some time with awesome gear and great people.

AHMW 2003 is held in NE Indiana, midway between three empires of synth 
music: Detroit, Chicago, and... uh... Dayton!

MAP #1 shows the location relative to Interstate 69 and the Indiana Toll 
Road.
MAP #2 shows the close-up view of where to park for easy gear unloading.

Please bring a $5 - $10 "Free will" donation to help pay for auditorium 
rental

The exact address is 245 S 1150 E, Lagrange, IN 46795
If you need help getting here, just email me.
drew@ph.k12.in.us

What to bring:
* Your cool synths
* Long extension cords and power strips
* Audio cables, small mixer and headphones
* Camera!

With so many synths begging to be played, headphones are ideal for 
exploring all the different instruments people bring.
I have a PA for the performances. Anyone wishing to bring additional PA 
equipment will be welcomed to do so :)

Performances:
Live performances of all kinds are encouraged. There are plans underway to 
record them and burn AHMW2003 CD's.
We should probably try to sync up a jam session as well :)

Food:
We will collect orders and $ for lunch and dinner. Lunch will be 
sandwiches from the Lagrange Subway, and dinner will be Papa John's pizza. 
Feel free to bring your own if you wish. There are a couple nearby 
restaurants and gas stations, but not much. Angola and Lagrange have 
McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc. PHHS is a rural school.

Also, since this is a school building, consumption of alcohol on the 
grounds is illegal, and smoking is not permitted inside.


A few of the local motels would be:

Ramada Inn (R on map #1) North of Angola at I69 exit 154
$89 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9471
has restaurant, bar, indoor pool and sauna

I can't tell you much about these, having never stayed at any of them. 
Several people stayed at the Best Western last year...

Sat Apr 05                         REBIRTH                             D.C.

D Tribe Productions is proud to present:
REBIRTH
APRIL 5TH 2003

D Tribe Productions is extremely excited to bring you what we consider to 
be one of our best line ups yet. For this one we brought some of the DJ's 
that we first introduced to DC, a few DJ's that have never been to DC and 
a couple favorites that we feel capture that D Tribe sound of funky house 
and breaks.

House DJ's include:

PAUL JOHNSON (Dust Traxx/ Nocturnal Interlude/ Chicago)
Over a year ago D Tribe's "Galactic Groove" was the first DC party to host 
this house legend. Paul is known world wide for continuously setting and 
resetting the direction of house music. We are extremely honored to have 
him back at one of our events.

ERIC DAVENPORT (Geisha House Music/ DTB/ Los Angeles)
This guy is one of the true pioneers of the underground dance circuit, 
having now played his own unique style of funky house in over 70 cities 
worldwide. We are excited to welcome Eric Davenport to one our events and 
we think he'll feel right at home amongst the house and breaks lovers who 
party with us.

DJ FUNK (Funk Records/ Chicago)
The undisputed king of booty house made his first appearance in Washington 
DC at a little annual event D Tribe named "Good Times." Since then DJ Funk 
has become a DC favorite and has always delivered that funk 
that he is so famous for. All booty house DJs have his records in their 
vinyl boxes and every booty house lover has heard him perform and can't 
wait to hear him again.

TRANSLUCENT (G-Swing/ Dust Traxx/ Transparent records/ Chicago)
His unique style and sound sets him apart from any DJ you've ever heard by 
playing TRUMPET LIVE WHILE SPINNING RECORDS!!!, combining the elements of 
live jazz with electronic music. His new label, Transparent Recordings, is 
slated for upcoming releases by Paul Johnson, Boo Williams and Craig 
Alexander.

LEXUS KING (Luv Child Ent./ Instinctive Grooves/ DC)
One of DC's favorite local DJs and a D Tribe favorite as well. Lexus King 
always brings that incredible sound of house music to any party and always 
keeps the floor moving from his first record to to his last.

RICHIE RICH (D Tribe Productions/ Rush NightLife Entertainment/ D.C.)
His house music is described as funky, vocal, latin and instrumental. His 
breaks are simply "old skool" and full of funky bass lines. This guy is 
all about making people move.

Break DJ's include:

TONY FALINE (Union Records/ Tampa Florida)
This is definitley one of our favorite DJs that we have had the pleasure 
to indroduce to our nation's capital. The last time he was here he left an 
ever lasting impression on every breaks lover who was in the crowd. Til 
this day
people still talk to us about his performance and we feel that it's been 
too long since DC welcomed this breaks favorite back.

GUMBEE (Zone Records/ Moonshine Music/ Soundvision/ Las Vegas, NV)
Here is yet another DJ that we are proud to be the first to bring to DC. 
Expect an incredible performance from him! Specializing in funky breaks, 
Gumbee's access to many unreleased new tracks, a wide variety of hard to 
find "old skool" and his unique programming style makes him one of the 
freshest DJs in the circuit.

DJ LOVE (Stellar Music/ Dallas Texas)
This will be DJ Love's first visit to to the Washington DC area. He has 
releases on Tommy Boy, Fabric Live and his very own Stellar Music. 
Breakbeats, hip hop, funk, soul and turntablism encompass Love's 
presentation on the decks. With precision cuts and scratches, and seamless 
mixing, Love has earned the title as a "Mixmaster" in his current 
hometown, Dallas, Texas. You do not want to miss this!!

JONH (Red Menace Records/ Moonshine Music/ DC)
One of DC's very own superstars. He has recently been signed to Moonshine 
Records and has releases out with DJ Dan, Simply Jeff and a bunch of other 
projects in the works. He is quickly becoming a superstar to look out for.
Recent releases include work with Rascal such as "Domino","America" and 
"TenDays."

DJ JOEY NEEL (D Tribe Productions/ Rush NightLife Entertainment/ DC)
DC's very own "old skool" breaks favorite. Always staying true to that old 
school hip hop oriented breaks sound and always keeping it funky the D 
Tribe way. His collection of old funky tracks and newer hard to find 
releases keep
you dancing and guessing what he's got in that vinyl box to throw down 
next.

Hip Hop / Raggae DJ's

ARMAGEDDON (Washington D.C, Hip Hop/Raggae Music)
We decided to add a little hip hop and raggae to move your asses to a 
slower beat at this party. The person that first came to mind to mix up 
that old school hip hop and raggae sound was Armageddon. We met him a 
little while back while out in DC and his style of music caught our 
attention and we had to share him with everyone.

TRINSTAR (Muzik Nashun/ Washington DC Sound/ DC)
Trinstar has 12 years of experience under his belt and is from Trinidad 
and Tobago. His style of old raggae mixed with today's raggae is sure to 
take you to a happy place. His record label "Muzik Nashun" is a Washington 
DC based company and he is one of the front people pushing raggae in DC.
Live Stage Performances include:

FIRE EATERS AND STAGE PERFORMERS-
Now we don't want to give to much away because we do love the element of 
surprise. What we will say is that on this special night we will provide 
an incredible stage performance with trained professional who love to play 
with fire for your enjoyment.

BOOGIE KNIGHTS-
Our breaks room will have the flavah of an incredible crew that will blow 
your mind with some incredible poppin' and lockin'. These guys do it like 
no other and will only add to an already incredible show.

LIVE DANCE AND STAGE PERFORMANCES

This event brought to you by Experimedia Communications, Molotov Records, 
Headroom Digital, Shift Club Night, and Touch Supper Club.

"This is one of the most significant rosters I've ever observed to grace 
the area and it's even more taunting for me that I couldn't be there to 
support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're truly privileged to be 
offered such rare appearances courtesy of the event producers who're 
credited. Those responsible obviously share an increasingly rare 
enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast with most 'parties'. 
They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an intimate setting, thus 
providing an amazing opportunity to witness these talents whose impact is 
undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all involved and encourage 
anyone who can't stand 'the same' music being played at 'parties' to treat 
yourself to an evening of what is sure to be a great experience and 
hopefully an eye-opening impression on a few of you!"

I quite my weekly residency and I'm playing two one-off club events this
week :-)

Friday I am opening for DJ Shell @ Moda (9-12) with 1/2 price Martini's and
free passes if you see me.

Saturday I am opening (9-12) for Travis Owens @ Abasso.  I'm not sure, but I
don't think they charge a cover early.

I'm very excited to be playing both of these clubs, which are new to
me!!!!!!

I haven't been to Moda yet.. Does it still draw crowds?
How much is cover for Shell? Perhaps I can convince people to head over there..

Not sure yet. I got a lil' sum up my sleeve 
I'm working on. I'd like to bring some 
ManMadeMan out, but I'm not sure Cleveland would
support it. I might have to take my ball to
Pittsburgh.

Filly is playing up there (Spy) this friday.  Robin is on saturday, and my
friends said she was playing 50 cent and justin timberlake at 1 am two weeks
ago.  I'm not sure what I'm gonna do at abasso yet, but it won't be too far
off of what I normally do.

First thing that come to mind was some free or modal jazz from the 60's 
and 70's...

But I'm just sitting at home working on some stuff and realized that

grindstone.

Ok..I'm almost 100% sure that the media is simply using the same set they
used for the Mars Lander shots..maybe just a different filter on the

Its a tough weekend to decide on an event...Friday, theres Goldie and Donald Glaude at 1120 in Cincy, Saturday, there's the Tech Itch/Dom & Roland show in Cincy/Dayton and the Doc Scott thing in Pittsburgh...too much to choose from that weekend...I'll probably hit up the Tech Itch/Dom & Roland show if I go out that weekend(I'm a broke-ass ho).  I've seen Doc Scott twice now in the past two years and have yet to see Dom & Roland or Tech Itch, so...thats where I'll be if I can afford it...

thats what i was thinking. some "kind of blue" or "bitches brew"
by miles, some "meditations" or "love supreme" by trane, "the
awakening" by ahmad jamal, some sun ra,  thats the kind of shit i
rock when im trying to supercharge the old noggin. clicky techno i
find really good for getting into a physical rythym when trying to
perform some remedial task at a very quick pace.

    what's the general consensus here on that

    i personally don't have an opinion one way

Subject: {pb-cle} Best MP3 mixing software??

Hey, can anyone give some advice on the best software to buy for mixing MP3's into a traditional DJ setup?

I want to add my PC to the 3rd channel on my mixer, and need some solid software at least capable of changing the BPM and cueing.  I found a demo of a program called AtomixMP3.  Is there a better/cheaper program out there?

We put a man on the moon. No doubt about it. Why go through all the
trouble of a mass cover-up if we didn't? Seriously? Why would we do
that?

I personally belive we did...but I welcome information and will
gladly listen and consider arguements.

hehehe, my point was to convey how much we (the general public)
simply don't and won't know because of the government and the media.

What's worse? THINKing we know the "whole story"...or knowing we know
nothing? (or lies)

I sell planetarium domes for living.  So I have spoke with several
"astro-personnel"   I can relay their thoughts that we have put a man on the
moon.  Also right now, we are working on getting to the moon in less than 24
hours.   That's from start to finish.  In order for us to ever land on Mars,
we need to launch from the moon.  Less gravity and shorter distance is why.

i don't know, theres alot of evidence on either side.

my biggest question is if we really did make it there, why did we stop 
going?
what is really on the dark side of the moon?  ;-)

but the 5th anniversary of the lunar landing poster over the teevee is cool.

    i was sleeping through most of the argument,
    but...

    why hasn't anyone been to the moon since?

    why did the russians quit trying to go to the moon
    just because americans made it there first?

    http://www.empusa.clara.net/lunar/lunar1.htm

    have you ever really given it any thought?

    i'm willing to entertain anything.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best MP3 mixing software??

final scratch seems the best to me, but 500$ for the rig+a good laptop 
if you want to be portable
i've played around with traktor and its pretty cool if you have a knob 
box and can send midi CCs at it, that way you can control the eq and 
faders and stuff from real knobs.

If you're using the standard 2 decks and a mixer, go with Final Scratch...the benefits of having it
far FAR otweigh the initial cost ($400+)

If you're looking for something a little less pricey, I'd recommend what I use: PCDJ (www.pcdj.com)
It works very similar to Pioneer cd players, you can trigger tracks from a standard keyboard, you
can tweak the pitch-change sensitivity, and you have a built in record-case right there.

If you're in Pittsburgh and around on Saturday night, stop by Jekyl & Hyde on the South Side. I use
it there every Saturday (for all different types of music), and it's solid as a rock.

Hey, can anyone give some advice on the best software to buy for mixing MP3's into a traditional DJ
setup?

I want to add my PC to the 3rd channel on my mixer, and need some solid software at least capable of
changing the BPM and cueing.  I found a demo of a program called AtomixMP3.  Is there a
better/cheaper program out there?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Mars Lander

I don't know with respect to why the Russians quit pursuing it. I do suspect 
we've actually been to the moon, because like Amanda mentioned, there isn't 
a whole lot to be gained by lying about it.

As far as returning to the moon is concerned, what is the main reason to 
want to? There is nothing there except wasteland, because there is virtually 
no atmosphere. Station for a telescope or broadcasting/receiving equipment? 
Why bother when you can throw something else into an orbit on its own? The 
only result of placing stuff on the moon, instead of in its own orbit, is 
the blocking of transmitted signals because of the moon's surface.

Tides are quite obviously affected by the moon, which is important, but its 
the weight, distance, and velocity of the moon that does this. Its not the 
stuff, or lack thereof, that is on the moon's surface. Eons of romantic 
bullshit aside, which admittedly is a BIG aside, the moon has a lot in 
common with all the other bits of useless discarded debris hurtling through 
space, trapped by the gravity of this speck of a little planet in a 
gargantuan cosmos.

    why hasn't anyone been to the moon since?

    why did the russians quit trying to go to the moon

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Best MP3 mixing software??

I'd have to agree with trouty and recommend Traktor. Yup, I may be
endorsed by NI, but I'd recommend it if I wasn't.

1. You get the PC and Mac versions when you buy it.
2. I've written a handful of utilities to sync your iTunes db to Traktor
if you're a Mac user. Just hit me up.
3. Midi clock sync / Midi master clock isn't there yet, but it is
coming. 
4. It's just solid as a rock.

About the only thing Traktor doesn't do that I wish it did is provide
more than two "decks" and allow for time stretching without
pitchshifting.

You may also consider Ableton Live depending on what you're doing, my
setup currently consists of a laptop with Live and a laptop with
Traktor. It's possible to DJ with Live, it's not exactly easy, but it's
pretty powerful. Live has the feature of being able to able to change
time stretch (no pitch shift) on the fly using various methods. 

I run a class on Traktor in Bloomington IN on weekends sometimes, if
there was enough interest in the Pb-Cle area, I'd be more than happy to
hook up with y'all, get you some demo cd's, demo songs to mix around
with, and some cool NI stuff. It's a pretty simple looking program with
some powerful features, worth some time and effort to learn it.

Hey, can anyone give some advice on the best software to buy for mixing
MP3's into a traditional DJ setup?

I want to add my PC to the 3rd channel on my mixer, and need some solid
software at least capable of changing the BPM and cueing.  I found a
demo of a program called AtomixMP3.  Is there a better/cheaper program
out there?

Apollo 11 Astronaut Decks Filmmaker

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Sept. 11, 2002
 
Astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin poses for fellow astronaut Neil
Armstrong, who shot this photo during their moon walk July 20, 1969.
(CBS/AP)

"Buzz Aldrin was forced to protect himself and his stepdaughter when
he was aggressively confronted outside a Beverly Hills hotel."
Publicist Robert O'Brien
 
(CBS) Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin offered a spirited
defense Wednesday as to why he decked a pushy filmmaker who wanted
him to swear on a Bible that he really did go to the moon  self
protection. 

"Buzz Aldrin was forced to protect himself and his stepdaughter when
he was aggressively confronted outside a Beverly Hills hotel," by
independent Nashville filmmaker Bart Sibrel, publicist Robert O'Brien
said in a prepared statement Tuesday. 

The statement added that Sibrel "has reportedly harassed other Apollo
Astronauts (across) the years." 

Sibrel, 37, who has spent years trying to prove that American
astronauts and especially Aldrin never landed on or walked on the
moon, said Aldrin punched him in the jaw when he tried to conduct an
ambush interview with him and then ran away. 

Sibrel said he'd confronted Aldrin twice before and was surprised
that Aldrin reacted the way he did this third time. 

"I was very surprised that he hit me, I thought it was very foolish
of him to do it in front of two video cameras," Sibrel said. "He has
a good punch. It was quick too. I didn't see it coming." 

He wants the Beverly Hills police to charge Aldrin with assault. 

A police spokesman said police were investigating but had not yet
spoken to Aldrin. Once the investigation is completed, its findings
will be forwarded to the district attorney to see what, if any,
action will be taken, the spokesman said. 

The police spokesman added that witnesses have come forward stating
that they saw Sibrel aggressively poke Aldrin with a Bible and that
Sibrel had lured Aldrin to the hotel under false pretenses so that he
could interview him. 

Sibrel told Reuters, "I approached him and asked him again to swear
on a Bible that he went to the moon, and told him he was a thief for
taking money to give an interview for something he didn't do." 

The incident was videotaped for a new Sibrel film, which claims to
prove that the Apollo 11 astronauts faked footage of their July 1969
trip to the moon to fool the Soviet Union into thinking the United
States had won the 1960s space race. 

Aldrin was the second man to take a walk on the moon, a feat recorded
on grainy black-and-white film footage and transmitted around the
world on July 20, 1969.

    snagged from one of the links i posted...

What was happening in the world in 1969? Well, the US had just changed 
it's underwear after the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Space Race was 
well and truly under way.

The Russians had already beaten the US by putting the first object in 
orbit, the first man in space, the first spacewalk and the first manmade 
object on the moon. The Americans were lagging well behind.

President Kennedy had declared that America would put a man on the moon 
- at almost any cost. And he was determined to beat the Russians to it.

    there's a whole lot to be gained by lying about
    it. ever hear of egg on your face?

    amanda, do you still have the same view about
    the man on the moon as you did earlier this morning?
    (given you've done your own research at this point)

I tried using Traktor and found it too..."busy"...

I'm curious to try it again, though.

Does Traktor have the availability of customizing the keyboard shortcuts?? I'd really like to be
able to set my own instead of learning a new setup...

And, to satisfy my sense of curiosity, what use is the MIDI sync if you're mixing MP3's?? Sync to
outboard effects?? That'd be cool to have...

I'd have to agree with trouty and recommend Traktor. Yup, I may be
endorsed by NI, but I'd recommend it if I wasn't.

1. You get the PC and Mac versions when you buy it.
2. I've written a handful of utilities to sync your iTunes db to Traktor
if you're a Mac user. Just hit me up.
3. Midi clock sync / Midi master clock isn't there yet, but it is
coming.
4. It's just solid as a rock.

About the only thing Traktor doesn't do that I wish it did is provide
more than two "decks" and allow for time stretching without
pitchshifting.

You may also consider Ableton Live depending on what you're doing, my
setup currently consists of a laptop with Live and a laptop with
Traktor. It's possible to DJ with Live, it's not exactly easy, but it's
pretty powerful. Live has the feature of being able to able to change
time stretch (no pitch shift) on the fly using various methods.

I run a class on Traktor in Bloomington IN on weekends sometimes, if
there was enough interest in the Pb-Cle area, I'd be more than happy to
hook up with y'all, get you some demo cd's, demo songs to mix around
with, and some cool NI stuff. It's a pretty simple looking program with
some powerful features, worth some time and effort to learn it.

Hey, can anyone give some advice on the best software to buy for mixing
MP3's into a traditional DJ setup?

I want to add my PC to the 3rd channel on my mixer, and need some solid
software at least capable of changing the BPM and cueing.  I found a
demo of a program called AtomixMP3.  Is there a better/cheaper program
out there?

I haven't spent my whole morning doing any kind of research about
this. 

I've never read anything other than pure conspiracy-theory drivel
stating otherwise. You seem convinced that we *didn't* go - but
again, I must ask, why bother with the huge cover-up? 

There are people who think the Holocaust never happened too...

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Best MP3 mixing software??

Mark and All,

Traktor 2.03 is the shizzy. You can customize the keyboard anyway you
want, you just hit the "learn" key, choose the action you want to
control via keystrokes/keypresses and there ya go. It also has good
support for an external mixer. I just hook mine up to my Quattro and go.
No need to worry about funky key combinations. 

The 1.x series of Traktor had Midi clock sync capability, and yes, it
was to do whatever the heck you wanted to do to sync the music playing
to whatever. Currently, I'm stuck tapping tempos between Live and
Traktor (TiBook user, no 1.x for Mac), but theoretically, you could have
Live timestetch (pitch shifted or not) any piece of audio to go along
with the song playing in the Traktor decks. Live's warping feature
really rocks here too, you can take A Cappella's cut them up into
refrains/verses, adjust the warp points of the track so it stretches
different portions of the audio in different ways to make lyrics match
any beat type you're into (breaks, house, two-step, polka, whatever).
The only thing that it really doesn't handle well this way is time
signature changes, but since y'all are mostly DJ's, I don't see this
being a significant problem.

Since Traktor has all sorts of nifty looping options, I've even created
whole new songs and remixes on the fly with this setup. 

Maybe someone needs to co-ordinate pb-cle-g33k & events? I'm sure we'd
all have a ball sharing playtime with toys.

I know we should know EVERYTHING, but do you think that the government
doesn't tell us alot for the simple fact that there's alot of people out
there that freak out over the little things?..   Besides, the media is
really pissing me off in this whole war ordeal. I wish there was something
else I could pay attention to that was more complete on information. It
seems like everytime I watch what's going on, Ill turn off the TV and come
back a few hours later, and something they said will change because they
didn't get facts straight.      bah!   im rambling.
I've just been sinking into what's going on right now, and getting
frustrated at the media for being straight idiots...   television rots the
brain.

Uhm, its really not that hard to prove, a decent terrestrial telescope is
really all thats necessary, if you look at the surface of the moon you can
see the bottom halfs of the landers, and the flags.  Granted that coulda
been put there by some automated system, but I'm sure if we were lying
SOMEONE was watching and saw the astronauts actually walking around, and if
they weren't up there the Russians etc would have called us out.  Thats the
whole problem with this "its fake" theory, any idiot could disprove it with
a mediocre telescope.

Subject: {pb-cle} Answer me this

Lance Armstrong had it all planned out as to what he was going to say
to the world when he first stepped foot on this moon. But instead, he
got so nervous that he screwed it up. He said, "That's one small step
for man ... one giant leap for mankind."

He was actually *supposed* to say, "That's one small step for *A* man
..." which, of course, actually makes better grammatical sense.

If the whole thing had been staged, why didn't they give him a second
shot to get his line right?

    i am not convinced, but after a little time
    doing research, i am more inclined towards
    that option than the other. i'm still keeping
    my options open, as i haven't been convinced
    one way or the other.

    why bother with the huge cover up?
    simple, to keep the egg of our face, and to
    make it seem we beat the russians there.

    i believe the holocaust happened, but that
    decision was based on photos, personal
    testimony by many, and the holocaust museum.

    not just photos produced by the government
    and a handful of testimonies.

They probably didnt change the line because it sounds a lot better to put

  And  not only that,i cant think of a much easier way to bankrupt a country other than forcing them  do to somethng that at the time was impossible.And also to add  fuel to the fire,at the time we supposedly landed on the moon you still had to get up and change the channel on the tv  yourself.And  also the  microwave was still in its infancy.Now i may  be just some  guy with his  head up his ass. But i find it highly unlikley that  the u.s. landed on the moon when we say we did.After all you would think  what  putting a man on the moon would be far  more complex than inventing a  remote control for your t.v. but once again this is just my opinion.

I don't think we were pouring billions of dollars into TV
remote-control research in the 60s, either.

Do you think we have the technology to land on the moon today? So if
we didn't actually land in 1969, why haven't we found the need to do
it more recently? Again, all you have to do is look in a telescope
and you can see the footprints yourself.

The people who don't believe that we landed on the moon are a perfect
example of the difference between a skeptic and a conspiracy theorist. A
skeptic will look at all the evidence with a critical eye and come to
his conclusion. A conspiracy theorist will make a conclusion and then
look for any possible supporting arguments, ignoring everything else.

http://www.skeptic.com/manifesto.html
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~korista/moonhoax2.html

Conspiracy theories are a lot like religion. No matter how far removed
from reality  they are, people will continue to believe them.

<<not just photos produced by the government and a handful of testimonies.>>

well, considering it wasn't a private venture, and the gub'ment is the only US organization that's
BEEN there or was involved in getting there, who else are you going to ask??

i'm not personally bashing anyone here, but there are things that you either have to believe, or you
don't, cause there's no other way you're gonna find out.

and to the question of why doesn't the government tell its citizens everything:

compared to what? iraq? yeeeeah...they know a LOT about what their government is doing, right??

oh, you mean the free world?? check out any political news from Mexico...their politicians our so
corrupt, they make D.C. look like Disney Land....

the reason we don't know is because most citizens don't want to know or need to know. plain and
simple.
that's the reason we have a government...to handle the shit that we don't have the time or
inclination to be involved in, so we can go about the job of living our lives, not being in a
militia like some ass backwards third world country, or running to the town well to get water every
morning, or paying some regional warlord a "privelidge of living in my neighborhood" tax.

and furthermore, there are libraries full of thousands of pages of government documents that i'm
sure the people complaining here haven't read. when you watch C-SPAN 24/7 and have read every
government dossier in existence, then come and complain to me.

While no system is flawless, the US government tells us more than any other government tells its
citizens anywhere else in the world.
I'm not saynig the US is perfect and waving my red, white and blue undies in anyone's face here, but
the fact is we're doing it better than anyone else in history thusfar, and that says something. you
don't like the way it works? get off your soapbox and change it. you've been given that right.

Moreover, how did they have such high-resolution pictures of the planet 
from so far away?  If there had not been people on the moon, then the 
photos of earth from the moon could have not been taken.

And don't listen to that "no stars in the sky" crap either.  In order to 
expose the moon's surface properly, the aperture of their cameras would 
have to be stepped way down, therefore not allowing the stars to be visible.

Lets not be ignorant ok?

Just curious, but where did you do research? Likely the internet, someplace 
that i've been led astray on more than one occasion.  The mere fact that 
Fox did a special on this topic suggesting that we didn't go to the moon 
does more work to convince me of the contrary than any proof to the same end.

I too was skeptical actually, I even went so far as to travel to the Air 
and Space museum in DC to check out the artifacts. The one thing that was 
indisputable proof to me was that the lunar astronauts left a mirror in the 
moon that scientists have been bouncing lasers off of for astronomical 
research.  I can't think of a way that it could have been placed there with 
1960s technology without someone being there.

CLAIM: The Van Allen radiation belts surrounding the Earth would have
fried the astronauts with a lethal dose of radiation. 

ANSWER: Wrong. If you blast right through the Van Allen belts it is
no problem, which is what the Apollo astronauts did. X-rays would be
lethal too, if you sat there soaking in them long enough. A very real
problem, however, are cosmic rays. They are not a problem on a short
flight like to the moon, but in long flights that might last years,
like to Mars, they could be a serious problem. 

Nick, you REALLY need to read this:

Yeah, Abbasso should be great this weekend on Saturday.  Travis is back in town, so I am incredibly looking forward to hearing him again.  And It'll be interesting to have a new face (Doug) play since I've never heard him before. 
And there are a few peeps going (at least that I know of).  Travis tends to draw a great crowd.

have you ever seen a space suit?  have you ever seen a radiation suit? (the 
kind they use in nuclear power plants?) a space suit is an order of 
magnitude more shielding than a radiation suit.

Plus, if radiation permeated space suits, there would have never been any 
astronauts. There wouldn't be more radiation on the moon than in space 
would there be? Especially if magnetic fields block radiation (which I 
don't believe is 100% true, but then, i'm not a nuclear physicist)  then 
the moon would have some shielding.  Then, add the fact that in open space 
one would be bombarded with beta and gamma particles from all angles.  When 
on a planet, the planet itself would provide shielding from ~50% of the 
radiation by virtue of its mass physically blocking the particles from 
coming at you.

SO, this theory is obviously BS, unless, you also believe there have never 
been people outside of spoacecraft in space.   OR, maybe you don't believe 
that anything has ever been in space.  Maybe some "Higher Power" just put 
those communications satellites in space for us to use.  Maybe, JUST maybe...

Come now.  Something reeks of fox news to me.

It would act as something of a slingshot, propelling the craft using the
forces of gravity, not only conventional (or unconventional) fuel sources.
There's also strong evidence which supports the existence of reserves of
frozen water on the moon.  If that water is there we could use it for
manufacturing fuel and supporting life in colonies.

How do you lie about a mirror placed on the moon?

What, did magic leprechauns put it there?

Did Baron Von Munchausen fly up there in his ballon and give it to the
moon people as token of good faith to the secret moon people government?

Funny they never bothered developing a space shuttle, then. Actually,
the Russians were always behind us. They were just a lot more reckless
than we were at the very beginning.

Maybe you'd find them if you actually looked.

Ummm.... before you go much further discussing the science of conspiracy
theories, I think you should check the science of basic mathematics.

Jupiter is, at its closest, approximately 600M kilometers away. It's
diameter is about 143,000 kilometers. That's a factor of 4195.

The moon is 384000 kilometers from Earth, and what you're looking for is,
to be generous, approximately 10 meters wide. That's a factor of >38 million.

In fact, you should be able to see Pluto more easily than the lunar pod.
The factor there is "only" 2.52 million. So how often have you seen Pluto
with a good set of binoculars? How often have you, or any of us, seen Pluto
at all?

I don't know precisely what magnification or aperture size we would need to
see these things if they are there, but if you're basing this on the fact
that you can't see 12-inch footprints from a few hundred thousand KM away
with binoculars, then you need to go back and do your homework before
trying to convince anyone of your theories.

No, they did develop a space shuttle.. well maybe they didn't develop it.. 
I remember seeing something about   a craft with a striking similarity to 
the Space shuttle with russian writing on it taking off... this must have 
been YEARS ago... it was on the news and we ALL know, if you see it on 
television, IT MUST BE TRUE!...

I wonder if that ever actually happened?

Good work!  I was thinking something along the same lines, but couldn't 
come up with the math to prove it.

Imagine how convincing conspiracy theories would be if intelligent people 
made them!

how about using one of those USB knobs that I've seen people talk 
about...  They suggested it as a jog dial for video editing, but 
who's to say you can't do the same for audio?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Best MP3 mixing software??

after using the final scratch for while now, i would NOT recomend it.  there
are too many things that can go wrong: the software, computer, usb cable, fs
i/o, rca cables, mixer, stylus, record plus human error such as mapping the
wrong track.  i have a ton of tunes that i would like to make into a demo
right now but i cant because my needles are just about shot.  doesnt it seem
strange that i am looking into getting my songs pressed to dub even though i
own this technology?  but the fact is i dont trust final scratch but whether
or not the thing is going to work, i still need to play my own music.

a cd player or tractor is probhably your best bet.  if your still
considering final scratch, there are alternatives.  check www.serato.com its
the same idea as final scratch but a bit cheaper and using the control
records is optional.  there is also another one comming out that uses a cd
player rather than a computer.

So are you claiming that every supposed space walk is faked too? No way, No 
way, Jose.

One example. The Hubble telescope was fucked. Astronauts were sent up there 
to install additional lenses to correct the focus. The Hubble has since 
produced the best deep-field images of our cosmos that the world has ever 
known.

That work had to be done by astronauts, who had to leave the relative safety 
of their space craft, wearing only space suits. These astronauts survived 
the radiation.

I think its preposterous to claim that the radiation in space would kill 
through those suits without ever having examined one. Its really not that 
far-fetched. Plus you've seen many subsequent images and films of 
space-walks.

There is still a flat earth society out there too. If you refuse to believe 
something, it doesn't mean you're correct in doing so.

I don't want to irritate you man, i just want you to stop talking so much
shit.  just shut your fucking mouth if you don't have anything positive to say
or even remotely intelligent, "drum and bass music still sucks"  what was the
point. i know for a fact no one gives a shit about your opinion or you for
that matter.  if you're going to criticize something do it intelligently so
that a discussion can ensue.

i'm the pussy?  keep 2steppin biotch!
i'm not trying to start anything, just stooping to your elementary level.

Also, if you have a decent net connection, the somafm stations are 
nice and laid back, although they occasionally skip on me.  Also 
check shoutcast for other ambient stations.

well, i was quite suprised to see that there were almost 200 people in
and out throughout the night. people were dancing like mad, chilling,
etc. alaska played an excellent set. dj^2 keeps getting better and
better everytime i see him. and of you who dont like him really need to
have your heard examined. his fader skills are tight, and his track
selection last night was superb, ending with an older "v" tune i cant
remember the name of. and then dieselboy. "the stalker" is inarguably
the best jungle tune out now. it was quite exhilirating to see the
entire room go insane when dieselboy dropped it. most people in
attendance had more than just basic knowledge of jungle. it was probably
the most amped crowd i have seen for drum and bass. dieselboy also
played some new tech itch stuff which was right off the fucking badass
scale. mad shoutouts to the crew i chilled with: josh ryan, nicky
bulletproof, jay, derek and shannon, bagel and shell, richard, and my
main negro don. also, negative shoutouts to the guy who pissed on the
floor.

HAHAHAHA

Tom is a PERP...the stalker is the best tune out now....i thought you hated 
all jungle after 96?!  wtf dude...get the stick out of your ass

How did your set go at Moda?  I wish I could make it

moving out and not having a place to live in about 1

I have a similar theory: If you bore through Jea Leigh's thick ice layer,
there might be a girl underneath. I'm not counting on it, though.

no sticks are in asses. its all about music that lasts. jungle is
throw away music. its good for 5 minutes, then its nothing. that
is not good music. like any addiction, getting rid of that "i need
a fix" mentality took a while, but you can start to see it in my
posts shortly after that, around the end of 99 and the beginning
of 00 when i started playing more and more abstract stuff and
mixing in more and more older tracks that were from a time when
jungle was better. 

anyway, if you go back further there are certainly many more funny
posts than that one about jungle when heads werent feeling the
dark stuff and me and my crew lived for it. over half a decade
ago. ha.

reminding people that there's still time to quit the crap drum and

"drum and bass". the good shit is jungle, cause thats what it was
called when the music wasnt fucking garbage.

are you trying to say that a junglist can have an intelligent
argument? haha. 

>i'm the pussy?  keep 2steppin biotch!

oh i will, dj ra. as a matter of fact, i havent bought more than 3
new jungle records in the 2 years since i quit spinning it, but
ill take my collection of jungle (minus the few hundred post-97
tunes i sold) over yours without even seeing it. shit, i have more
jungle records sitting in my room than 90% of the "drum and bass"
deejays ive met in my life, and i dont even play the shit. and id
take my 2-step collection over your "drum and bass" records as well. 

>i'm not trying to start anything, just stooping to your

is the "Ra" some "rah-rah" type cheerleader shit? "drum and bass"
needs some cheerleading to get it out of its bullshit cycle.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} About Moda Mr. Burkhart

I had fun and did what they asked (which is EXACTLY what I like to do).
They asked for deeper vocal cocktail hour house, so I went from naked music,
to some deep stuff, to some more clubby stuff and ended up with The Fog -
Been a long time (hoxton whores mix) - which dawned me was murk's first big
hit and that this is the third round of popularity of prog house..  I got to
explore about 75% of what I wanted to play, the stuff I didn't get to was
because I hadn't figured where to place it in the set..  Shell was sounding
good, and about the time I finished it was time for the dancers to do their
thing and the club started to fill up.   I'm only sorry I didn't get to work
with Mr. James Brundage on lights and visuals... oh well.

As for spinning their again, I hope so.  It appears that they are going on a
week to week basis with who they use as the opener for Shell but they seem
to be looking for a loungey adult sound for this slot (early fridays).  They
were adamant about keeping the volume VERY low so that people could
socialize.

Maybe you can make it up to Abasso on Saturday -- I'll buy you a drink!

d



For what its worth, here are my favorite tracks:

KASKADE:  It's you, It's me (OM us)
SHAREM JEY:  4 da loverz, hotseppa (Hong Kong UK)
MIND INFLUENCE:  The Best Part (Soulfuric US)
TERRI WALKER:  Guess you didn't love me (Ben watt remixes)
BEN WATT (white label)
TIEFSCHWARZ:  Never (Joshua rmx -- i'm supa late on this one)
Anything by Jask
JAY J & CHRIS LUM:  Freaks like Us (mojolators rmx -- another one i am late
on)
SANDY RIVERA:  Changes (original AND ben watt rmx... sometimes both)
JOSHUA:  Imagineary EP
VARIOUS, KID CREME:  Italian Style
ERNEST ST LAURENT:  In the sky (not late, but older)
SOULSEARCHER:  Feelin Love
CHRIS LUM:  Bigger Tool
THE FOG vs HOXTON WHORES:   Been a long time
ARTIFICAL FUNK:  Together
JT DONALDSON:  ???? (Lowdown #11)

oh... and i missed it the first time but it is getting reworked...
DJ OJI:  WE LIFT OUR HANDS IN THE SANCTUARY (biggest gospel house track of
last year... damn small labels pressing under 1000 copies).

OH, and let me just say MARQUESS WYATT rocks and I hate myself for not
getting to see him at WMC.

Subject: {pb-cle} Didi & Mr. Stitch @ Mango 



Mango tonight features the deep and funky house of DJ Didi, and the dark 
progressive sound of Mr. Stitch. Both have been working the city for awhile 
and really know how to bring it to a crowd. Didi has been a Groove resident 
for over two years, and Mr. Stitch is hypervinyl's progressive guru and a 
driving force behind the afterhours night Touch.

As always Mango is free
2106 Penn ave in the strip, The dejAVu lounge.
21+, no tennis shoes or baseball caps.
11-2

and catch Osmotic and Mike Moran tonight at touch from 3-5 for a driving set 
of Tech-House and whatever else we can dig up.

Subject: {pb-cle} Mindisc recorder suggestions

Hey all,

For a lot of reasons, I'm thinking that getting a minidisc player would be a
good idea for recording sets.  I was using a standalone computer, but that's
no longer viable.  Likewise, from all of the reviews I've been reading,
using an external soundboard like the Creative Extigy would be more problems
than it's worth.  Hence, I have resolved that my best solution is a good
quality portalbe Minidisc recorder/player.

I've spent almost 2 hours reading reviews, comparing prices and what-not.
Overall, it seems like the whole minidisc scene is pretty fucked up.  Sony's
DRM bullshit basically prevents what would be really easy (record sets onto
the MD and upload them to the computer, which is exactly what I want to dO).
The other option is to get a unit that has optical output, plug that into my
audigy 2 drive bay thing and copy it to my computer that way.

Anyone else in this same boat?  What do you use to achieve good quality
recordings of your sets when you're either in a cramped studio or away?  I'm
looking for suggestions here for I drop $150 to $250 on one of these things.

Thanks.

- Froggy

Check this out (in it's very infant forms):

I woulda pasted the text here, but it's way easier to understand with the 
pics.

I hope this gets improved, gonna need some seriously high-res scanners.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Mindisc recorder suggestions

I spent about 300 dollars for a player that records onto a cd, straight from
the mixer. You can get a program ex: Forge Sound, that can master the cd for
you. I don't really master my cd's because the sound quality is pretty good
coming from the recorder.
I love using it, because I can basically hook it up to anything to record,
and it even erases, and has text for the cds......    I know you cant use a
regular disc to record. I think they call them audio discs?.. I cant
remember because I've stocked up on them, and haven't bought any in a
while..

I was just trying to find a link to the one I have, but I'm not at home and
cant get the info from the recorder..  I'll do so later =)

Right now it's that or a $15,000 laser pickup table. You can't scratch=20=

What kills me is that for $15,000, they don't pay for shipping.

I prefer the latter, directly sampling vinyl in using my SP1200s, at quartz 
[0% pitch adjustment.]  When archived, I don't muck with the sound, so I get 
an accurate _reference_ copy.  I can always clean it up later for replay, 
and still maintain that copy /:]

The library of Congress is doing just that with old 'edison tubes,' 
acetates, 78's, and more recent vinyl for archival purposes.  Search the 
History Channel's web.node for more intel.

Ridiculous. I mean, it's cool that the guy has a hobby and all, but... I'd
rather see if a scan of his baby pictures created some kind of worthwhile
sound. Maybe in the future we'd be able to fingerpaint digital sounds.

Wait a second. Why are we getting so fancy here? You can get a nearly
perfect rip from vinyl with a decent soundcard and a copy of soundforge. All
you need to do is make sure the vinyl is clean and then use an elliptical
needle to get the best sound quality. Use a high sample rate and then apply
filters only if necessary. I guarantee that you can produce a WAV with this
method that is just as good as those from laser pickups. Spending $15k would
be a big waste of money. If you're reading this, you've already got the
equipment.

Now, if the record is destroyed... well... I guess you're fucked anyway. It
would take a lot of post-processing to get something good even off of a
laser.

What do you use to achieve good quality recordings of your sets when you're
either in a cramped studio or away?  I'm looking for suggestions here for I
drop $150 to $250 on one of these things. }}

Archos makes a harddrive solution in the form of the Jukebox Recorder. There
you can record and encode on the fly at up to 160kpbs MP3. I think you can
also record an uncompressed WAV, but make sure you get a big enough drive.
Archos also makes a portable CD-RW drive that can burn a CD in real time
from a live input (I think they still make this).

There's also the Creative Nomad... anybody know anything about it's
recording capabilities?

 actually i am in the same boat exactly. i bought the
sony net md only to find out that sony (naturally) has
to kiss the record industry's ass and keep me from
uploading mixes. however, you can still go in through
the sound card and record the sets onto say
soundforge, and use the tools to bring up the levels
to copensate for the loss in sound quality. i've done
it many times and the sets still sound good. the md is
so convenient, and so easy to hook up on the fly, i
think for the money it's the way to go, unless you got
a lap-top, which i for one will probly never be able
to afford. another nice thing about the md is you can
record in long play mode for downloaded sets, or for
just recording practice sets, you can get 4 hours on
there with good enough for personal use sound quality.
i use my md daily, and i'm totally happy with it,
except for the can't upload thing.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Mindisc recorder suggestions

there are mp3 player HD based things that can record a .wav file
and then communicate with a computer directly. the obvious
advantage is that you dont get the compression that minidisc uses.
it might be a little more expensive, but i dont think it would be
by much.

Subject: {pb-cle} Encoding to MP3

Hopefully in a few months I'm going to have me a mp3 server computer 
(or even possibly a full multimedia one) that I'll hook up to my 
stereo.  So I want to take all my cd's and rip them to MP3, simple 
enough.  My problem is I want to rip the mix cd's I have into one 
huge file to eliminate the gaps between songs.  I can't find any 
programs that can do this.  One thing I was thinking of doing is 
ripping each song, then finding some sort of mp3 joiner to join them 
together.  But there might be little glitches inbetween the songs.

I have messed with the gapless output on winamp and it seems to work 
well.  But this mp3 server will probably be running linux, and I 
haven't had much experience with XMMS, is there a gapless output for 
that?  I would assume so.  But keeping it split in multiple tracks 
then prevents me from randomizing the play list, because it will take 
the tracks out of order.  That's why I figured the one large file 
would be better.

Comments, suggestions, ideas???

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Encoding to MP3

Umm. I'm kinda confused.

1. Yes, there is gapless output for xmms.

2. You can also use cue sheets to cut gaps with mixes that are already
cut on tracks, and to mark tracks in long mixes. Just fire up notepad
(or vi, emacs, whatever):

Example #1. This is one long mix, cut up into individual songs (This
file would be named AIMIX.cue):

FILE "AIMIX.MP3"
TRACK 01 AUDIO
INDEX 01 00:00:00 
TRACK 02 AUDIO 
INDEX 01 05:50:65 
TRACK 03 AUDIO 
INDEX 01 09:47:50 
TRACK 04 AUDIO 
INDEX 01 15:12:53 
TRACK 05 AUDIO 
INDEX 01 25:02:40 
TRACK 06 AUDIO 
INDEX 01 27:34:05 
TRACK 07 AUDIO 
INDEX 01 31:58:53 
TRACK 08 AUDIO 
INDEX 01 35:08:65 

There's sites like http://www.cuesheet.info/ that have tons of cuesheets
for mixes and cd's that are already out there.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} Encoding to MP3

Forgot all about cue files.  Here's another scenario.  I downloaded a 
couple mixes that have been split up into tracks.  Are there any 
programs out there that will join them all together, then make a .cue 
file?

Not reliably....

The best method, really is to use Winamp to export everything to one file, then use a wave editor
like Sound Forge or Cool Edit to clean it up...

For some reason, the MP3's have like .05 second of dead space at the beginning or end, so even if
you re-export it to a big ass wave, it'll still have minor gaps.

I've been doing this for years....the best, most relilable way is still doing it by hand.

Subject: {pb-cle} Dj Assault (Detroit) @ Groove in Buffalo, April 4th

Friday nights in Buffalo have been severely lacking on
good times, so myself along with Groove Niteclub have
brainstormed and are putting together weekly cheap
special events to give em a kick start... It's all
about goin to the club and just having a great time..
Here's our first Friday night..

bucky & Groove present.... 

Friday April 4th.. 

DJ Assault (Fused Management / Detroit) 
http://www.djassault.com/ 
-- Songs he has produced himself like "Ass 'n Titties"
and "Yo Relatives" have turned into genre classics.
Anything is game when Assault DJs, be it house,
techno, jungle, R & B or whatever -- as long as
booties are bouncing. He has rocked parties around the
world, including sets in Germany, Holland, France,
Spain and throughout North America. Each time it's the
same: When he steps up to the decks and unleashes that
high-speed booty-shake, the audience has only one
option -- to shut up and dance. 

Along with.... 

Tweek 
Thik 
Matt Haze 

$10/$12 Cover 
18+ / 21+ to drink

Are you SERIOUS?  The dj miko is sorta acceptable... but the Hammer????

I am not opposed to cheesy stuff at all... however as I was playing the
sample  from the distributor last saturday I had 4 people yelling at me to
"turn that shit off... don't even think about wasting money on that
rubbish".  I like to think that we have moved beyond that stuff -- a track
like that could set the scene back 2 years.

I dunno.... if this is what underground dance music has become... i just
dunno.  i mean sampling disco/funk was one thing, but sampling a track that
sampled disco/funk... let Tiga rework can't touch this and it MAYBE could be
acceptable (his nelly remake is quite funny).

I better stop now before I get rude and start referrencing a certain cable
tv show where those tracks would be BIG hits.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} For Goose...

More on this subject...

I was thinking...

OK, so maybe I am a bit hypocritical because back in the day -- mid 90's --
I really enjoyed hardcore.  The thing is, back then a good dj would serve
HAPPY hardcore, with the really dark evil stuff, along side the gabber
records.   The thing is... this stuff never had a chance of ever becomming
mainstream accesable.  The hypocrasy comes because there were tons of cheese
involved in the happy hardcore part of the program (my favorites).

I think the reason I have an issue with these MC Hammer & DJ Miko things is
that mainstream amercia actually considers this to be proper dance music.
They could be heard right alongside DJ SAMMY.  They style in which they are
presented are just 135-140 BPM EURO records. It is simply a rehash of top40
radio records (like labouche, culture beat & dj miko the first time) only a
little more extreme this time around.   If these were in the 147-150 BPM
range (out of the grasp of being mainstream friendly) I would understand and
respect their campy nature.  After all, dance music is supposed to be fun.
My issues come when the people who get "the joke" and understand the campy
aspect become the minority.

Maybe the whole thing was a joke, and I got caught because I didn't watch
this whole thread :-P

Well, it's somewhat of a joke.  Seems like Goose and I have become =
connoisseurs of cheesy 80's remakes, which sometimes can be actually =
pretty good (Unix - "Wild Pleasure" and Hypetraxx - "Send Me An Angel" =
being wo examples).

Which reminds me, Topaz jacked one of my ideas, to do a whole mix based =
on this.  I think the DJ Irene vs. George Centeno mix of "Cars" would be =
interesting.

Subject: RE: {pb-cle} For Goose...

Axel Konrad did a killer remake of Hot Butter's "Popcorn". It's more of
a cheezy 70's remake, but it's got an 80's feel. 

Just had to share.

Well, it's somewhat of a joke.  Seems like Goose and I have become
connoisseurs of cheesy 80's remakes, which sometimes can be actually
pretty good (Unix - "Wild Pleasure" and Hypetraxx - "Send Me An Angel"
being wo examples).

Which reminds me, Topaz jacked one of my ideas, to do a whole mix based
on this.  I think the DJ Irene vs. George Centeno mix of "Cars" would be
interesting.

  OK, so maybe I am a bit hypocritical because back in the day -- mid

i got it done, breaks stylee... except my webhost server is being moved to
chicago right now so i dont have a place to chuck it...  it's fairly
straightforward breaks, nothing super exciting, just something that would
flow well if you wanted to mix cheese in with your breaks set (filler remix,
if you will)

ok, i have two tickets to (paradise! heh) see a chamber music ensemble
tonight at carnegie hall .. 8 pm.  if anyone would like to join me, as i
have yet to find anyone after getting the tickets today, give me a ring
818.2962 so we can coordinate.  i would -prefer- single, attractive women
but i know that those don't always exist in conjunction .. also, i don't
always fuck on the first date.  ok, shenanigans aside i am going to this
thing tonight and i have a ticket and it should be fun if you dig classical.

here's some info:  http://trfn.clpgh.org/pcms/Takacs.shtml

call me asap.  i'm probably waiting a maximum of 1 hour, then i'm dropping
it and giving them to some friends.

Yeah, their main sound board is down, so they 
weren't able to broadcast. However, I did have 
the whole show recorded directly off of the 
board they were using.and will soon be giving it 
out as another promo item. So keep your eyes open
for it!

Damn, usually you can catch the archive of the show, but it appears 
that isn't working as well.  Ohh well.

Originating from Streetsboro, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.html
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

I am no longer listing club/weekly events, there are just too many of them
and many are not stable and fold frequently.  for pittsburgh clubs,
www.scris.com will list your club events.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

For weekly/club events look at the weeklies schedule I maintain.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/weeklies

Also, Josh has a list of pittsburgh club events and more at 
http://www.scris.com/weeklies/

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Youngstown,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

Sat Mar 29                ANALOGUE HEAVEN MIDWEST V              NE Indiana

[not music, but gear related]

Analogue Heaven MidWest 2003

"The Voyager Home"
Official Information

The FIFTH annual AHMW get-together will be Saturday, March 29th at the 
PHHS Auditorium. I'll be there by 9:00 am. Who knows what time (or day) it 
will be when we're done :) All synthgeekgearheads are encouraged to join 
us and spend some time with awesome gear and great people.

AHMW 2003 is held in NE Indiana, midway between three empires of synth 
music: Detroit, Chicago, and... uh... Dayton!

MAP #1 shows the location relative to Interstate 69 and the Indiana Toll 
Road.
MAP #2 shows the close-up view of where to park for easy gear unloading.

Please bring a $5 - $10 "Free will" donation to help pay for auditorium 
rental

The exact address is 245 S 1150 E, Lagrange, IN 46795
If you need help getting here, just email me.
drew@ph.k12.in.us

What to bring:
* Your cool synths
* Long extension cords and power strips
* Audio cables, small mixer and headphones
* Camera!

With so many synths begging to be played, headphones are ideal for 
exploring all the different instruments people bring.
I have a PA for the performances. Anyone wishing to bring additional PA 
equipment will be welcomed to do so :)

Performances:
Live performances of all kinds are encouraged. There are plans underway to 
record them and burn AHMW2003 CD's.
We should probably try to sync up a jam session as well :)

Food:
We will collect orders and $ for lunch and dinner. Lunch will be 
sandwiches from the Lagrange Subway, and dinner will be Papa John's pizza. 
Feel free to bring your own if you wish. There are a couple nearby 
restaurants and gas stations, but not much. Angola and Lagrange have 
McDonald's, Taco Bell, etc. PHHS is a rural school.

Also, since this is a school building, consumption of alcohol on the 
grounds is illegal, and smoking is not permitted inside.


A few of the local motels would be:

Ramada Inn (R on map #1) North of Angola at I69 exit 154
$89 double incl cont breakfast ph 219-665-9471
has restaurant, bar, indoor pool and sauna

Sat Apr 05                         REBIRTH                             D.C.

D Tribe Productions is proud to present:
REBIRTH
APRIL 5TH 2003

D Tribe Productions is extremely excited to bring you what we consider to 
be one of our best line ups yet. For this one we brought some of the DJ's 
that we first introduced to DC, a few DJ's that have never been to DC and 
a couple favorites that we feel capture that D Tribe sound of funky house 
and breaks.

House DJ's include:

PAUL JOHNSON (Dust Traxx/ Nocturnal Interlude/ Chicago)
Over a year ago D Tribe's "Galactic Groove" was the first DC party to host 
this house legend. Paul is known world wide for continuously setting and 
resetting the direction of house music. We are extremely honored to have 
him back at one of our events.

ERIC DAVENPORT (Geisha House Music/ DTB/ Los Angeles)
This guy is one of the true pioneers of the underground dance circuit, 
having now played his own unique style of funky house in over 70 cities 
worldwide. We are excited to welcome Eric Davenport to one our events and 
we think he'll feel right at home amongst the house and breaks lovers who 
party with us.

DJ FUNK (Funk Records/ Chicago)
The undisputed king of booty house made his first appearance in Washington 
DC at a little annual event D Tribe named "Good Times." Since then DJ Funk 
has become a DC favorite and has always delivered that funk 
that he is so famous for. All booty house DJs have his records in their 
vinyl boxes and every booty house lover has heard him perform and can't 
wait to hear him again.

TRANSLUCENT (G-Swing/ Dust Traxx/ Transparent records/ Chicago)
His unique style and sound sets him apart from any DJ you've ever heard by 
playing TRUMPET LIVE WHILE SPINNING RECORDS!!!, combining the elements of 
live jazz with electronic music. His new label, Transparent Recordings, is 
slated for upcoming releases by Paul Johnson, Boo Williams and Craig 
Alexander.

LEXUS KING (Luv Child Ent./ Instinctive Grooves/ DC)
One of DC's favorite local DJs and a D Tribe favorite as well. Lexus King 
always brings that incredible sound of house music to any party and always 
keeps the floor moving from his first record to to his last.

RICHIE RICH (D Tribe Productions/ Rush NightLife Entertainment/ D.C.)
His house music is described as funky, vocal, latin and instrumental. His 
breaks are simply "old skool" and full of funky bass lines. This guy is 
all about making people move.

Break DJ's include:

TONY FALINE (Union Records/ Tampa Florida)
This is definitley one of our favorite DJs that we have had the pleasure 
to indroduce to our nation's capital. The last time he was here he left an 
ever lasting impression on every breaks lover who was in the crowd. Til 
this day
people still talk to us about his performance and we feel that it's been 
too long since DC welcomed this breaks favorite back.

GUMBEE (Zone Records/ Moonshine Music/ Soundvision/ Las Vegas, NV)
Here is yet another DJ that we are proud to be the first to bring to DC. 
Expect an incredible performance from him! Specializing in funky breaks, 
Gumbee's access to many unreleased new tracks, a wide variety of hard to 
find "old skool" and his unique programming style makes him one of the 
freshest DJs in the circuit.

DJ LOVE (Stellar Music/ Dallas Texas)
This will be DJ Love's first visit to to the Washington DC area. He has 
releases on Tommy Boy, Fabric Live and his very own Stellar Music. 
Breakbeats, hip hop, funk, soul and turntablism encompass Love's 
presentation on the decks. With precision cuts and scratches, and seamless 
mixing, Love has earned the title as a "Mixmaster" in his current 
hometown, Dallas, Texas. You do not want to miss this!!

JONH (Red Menace Records/ Moonshine Music/ DC)
One of DC's very own superstars. He has recently been signed to Moonshine 
Records and has releases out with DJ Dan, Simply Jeff and a bunch of other 
projects in the works. He is quickly becoming a superstar to look out for.
Recent releases include work with Rascal such as "Domino","America" and 
"TenDays."

DJ JOEY NEEL (D Tribe Productions/ Rush NightLife Entertainment/ DC)
DC's very own "old skool" breaks favorite. Always staying true to that old 
school hip hop oriented breaks sound and always keeping it funky the D 
Tribe way. His collection of old funky tracks and newer hard to find 
releases keep
you dancing and guessing what he's got in that vinyl box to throw down 
next.

Hip Hop / Raggae DJ's

ARMAGEDDON (Washington D.C, Hip Hop/Raggae Music)
We decided to add a little hip hop and raggae to move your asses to a 
slower beat at this party. The person that first came to mind to mix up 
that old school hip hop and raggae sound was Armageddon. We met him a 
little while back while out in DC and his style of music caught our 
attention and we had to share him with everyone.

TRINSTAR (Muzik Nashun/ Washington DC Sound/ DC)
Trinstar has 12 years of experience under his belt and is from Trinidad 
and Tobago. His style of old raggae mixed with today's raggae is sure to 
take you to a happy place. His record label "Muzik Nashun" is a Washington 
DC based company and he is one of the front people pushing raggae in DC.
Live Stage Performances include:

FIRE EATERS AND STAGE PERFORMERS-
Now we don't want to give to much away because we do love the element of 
surprise. What we will say is that on this special night we will provide 
an incredible stage performance with trained professional who love to play 
with fire for your enjoyment.

BOOGIE KNIGHTS-
Our breaks room will have the flavah of an incredible crew that will blow 
your mind with some incredible poppin' and lockin'. These guys do it like 
no other and will only add to an already incredible show.

LIVE DANCE AND STAGE PERFORMANCES
These ladies apart from being beutiful are exciting to watch when they 
dance. They will put an awsome show for everyone to enjoy through a 
combination af dance and visual arts.

violence they will be removed by Antioch College Securities if they don't
re-evaluate their ignorance immediately. This event is more than a
protest, it is an affirmation.

This event brought to you by Experimedia Communications, Molotov Records, 
Headroom Digital, Shift Club Night, and Touch Supper Club.

"This is one of the most significant rosters I've ever observed to grace 
the area and it's even more taunting for me that I couldn't be there to 
support Legowelt's last appearance in town. We're truly privileged to be 
offered such rare appearances courtesy of the event producers who're 
credited. Those responsible obviously share an increasingly rare 
enthusiasm for hosting shows that largely contrast with most 'parties'. 
They are bringing LIVE INTERNATIONAL TALENT to an intimate setting, thus 
providing an amazing opportunity to witness these talents whose impact is 
undoubtedly global. I extend grateful props to all involved and encourage 
anyone who can't stand 'the same' music being played at 'parties' to treat 
yourself to an evening of what is sure to be a great experience and 
hopefully an eye-opening impression on a few of you!"

has pretty much crushed everybody who hears him play...insane scratch and
cut skills applied to breakcore.  with locals impercept doing a live set,

_________________________________________________________________________________

The party will start at 8:30 pm and go until 7:00 am,so come out and party 
through the sunset and party until the sun rises again.

Lots of parking is available but carpooling is recomended just to make 
things easier.You won`t want to miss this event,there will be music that 
everyone can enjoy. Water,glowsticks,all that fun ravey stuff will be 
available,also.

Fliers will be done (hopefully) by the 28th of March.

Since this is an outdoor event the only thing we ask of you (aside from 
comming and making this party a blast) is that you respect the 
property,this means try to put your cigarette butts where they belong (not 
on the ground,unless you want to help us pick them up in the morning),and 
also if you`re handed a flier that you don`t want,either tell the person 
handing them out you don`t want it,or take it and put it in the 
trash,there will be plenty of bags around,same goes for water bottles and 
anything else you might throw on the ground.This is a beautiful venue 
surrounded by a state park,so try to keep everything nice looking. This 
venue is in the middle of no where and all permits have or will be taken 
care of,so this event is sure to go off without any problems.

No drugs,Alcohol,Markers,Weapons or anything else that might get you or us 
in trouble and the event shut down.

Info line will be 724.831.1373 for anyone who needs info about something 
to do with the event.

Email us at rrp2k3@yahoo.com if you`re interested about playing and we`ll 
send you an address to send your demo to.

Venue is about 35 minutes north of Pittsburgh,4 turns off 79 (exit 
96),more specific directions will be posted as soon as the fliers are out.

Please check www.rrproductions.cjb.net for more updates,and pics of the

Trendroid, and others...

Doors at 9pm. No cover. 21+. Fridays are not afterhours. Arrive early.
Abbasso Underground Lounge, the basement club of Bottoms Up

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Gavin tonight!

I wish I could go, but I have to work the next morning.  I've never seen Gavin 
or Robbie for that matter, but I saw Scott back in June of '99 at Kabowli and 
his set was the shit!!  That was the same party where I met Luke for the first 
time. :-)

(cheese) and some house (cheese)... but here's where part B comes into =
play, they have $1.50 pitchers all night long.  I think it's like =
keystone light or something of that variety, but hey, it's 1.50 for a =
pitcher, ya know?  Just wanted to toss the idea out to anyone in the =

I might even start mixing it up more and more once i get a chance to =
start training the crowd.  They will always have the 1.50 pitchers on =
thursday nights(they had started off as 1.00 pitchers, but that turned =
ugly as it got too packed, so by raising the price 50 cents on a college =
campus, it naturally dropped the attendance to a reasonable level...lol)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

You know them, you love them, they kick a lot of ass...   and they get better 
every year.   They run one of the most successful record stores in DC, and a 
fantastic label of the same name (Yoshitoshi).   After spinning around the 
world and maybe in your own backyard (if your Hugh Hefner) this duo is just 
awe-some.   Their recent success on the Global Underground series number 21 
from Moscow is critically acclaimed as the best in the long running series 
(by many people)...

They are Deep Dish.

I've recently heard them live at Transit in Philadelphia and it was up there 
with some of my best experiences at the ex-post-de-facto-super-club: Twilo 
(The Digweedian sound lives on!)   I HIGHLY recommend the Global Underground 
21.

This Month End Super Set (MESS) is the Essential Mix from July 12th 1998.   
It may be 5 years past but this is the sound where the super duo got started. 
  The set can be found at:

      http://www.djbradanderson.com/mixes.php

Like all month end s.sets, this posting will only last through Monday, March 
31st at 11:59pm or the download limit is reached (which ever is first).   Be 
sure to right click and download it (so it doesn't play in your browser).   
The file size is 107megs so be ready for a long wait.   At least it is a fast 
connection.

May our troops return safely.

Thank you to everyone who attended my label party last night!

Aside from the great music - which included some selections from the label 
(including a track i produced yesterday afternoon ;]), we gave away 9 test 
pressings, 32 dj mix cds (that I know of...), some intel on learning to fly, 
frisbees from a local flight training operation, and much love to the 
community.

Mad respect you local cats.

nspace.  It was good to see many familiar faces throughout the club and
party communities represented.  Many of us are looking forward to having
Cleveland represented once again on the underground music map with your
label as well as the quality music that is going to come from it.  Cheers!

Monday, March 31st, 2003 at the 5:01 Jazz Bar in Columbus


Featuring:

Shawn Rudiman
Pittsburgh. 7th City. Technoir Audio. Persuasive. Hypervinyl.
Finally gaining worldwide recognition from the techno community in 1999 with
his stunning debut for Detroit's 7th City label, Shawn Rudiman has rapidly
built himself up to become one of the most eagerly observed figures in the
scene. Writing futuristic and melodic music containing exceptional depth and
funk, his ensuing reputation has been justly deserved.
Hailing from Pittsburgh, USA, he is renowned for his live sets as well as
his releases - performances outstanding not only in their musical content
but also the large degree of genuine improvisation that goes into them -
each one a fluid jam, occasionally lasting up to five hours.  Shawn's
production style steers clear of any standard 'club' techno format, instead
delving deep into the more jazzy, melodic side of the genre - layering
synthetic chords, bass grooves, keyboard harmonies and sometimes vocal
snippets to create thickly textured, subtlety expanding and inimitably
danceable works.
Shawn's musical career began as one half of THD, an industrial/EDB group
which gave him his first releases. After four albums and almost ten years
involved in that project, he became influenced by the deeper, soulful
grooves of Detroit techno - utilising his extensive collection of vintage
analog equipment, he began experimenting with this music, producing and
releasing first as Tr-Generation on his own Hypervinyl imprint, then more
successfully as himself on Dan Bell's 7th City Records- before recently
setting up his current label, Technoir Audio with partner Jwan Allen.
Shawn Rudiman's unique sound has earned him appearances around the globe,
including a spot at the now infamous Detroit Electronic Music Festival.  He
has been hailed as one of the best electronic live performances by techno
legends such as Dan Bell and Anthony "Shake" Shakir.  At Proceed he will
bring his acclaimed live performance of Detroit Techno to Columbus.

Archetype
Columbus. Cookin, Black Nation. 21/22. Glyph.
Columbus based recording artist and 21/22 Corporation and Glyph label-head
Charles Noel is better known to the world as Archetype.  With several full
length albums under his belt on Kalamazoo's Black Nation Records, and the
U.K.'s Theory Records, as well as a slew of singles on Black Nation, Theory,
Germany's Ongaku, Inkubator, and 77 Records, and appearances on numerous
compilations, Charles Noel is no stranger to the international electronic
music scene.  In 1995, under the alias Monochrome he released what is
credited as the first U.S. Drum & Bass record, entitled the "Reconnaissance
EP."  In 1997 as Charles Noel switched his focus more and more towards
techno, he released "Time Dilation Effect" on his own 21/22 Corporation
imprint revealing the Archetype alias to the world for the first time.  Over
the past 6 years Charles Noel has steadily released ground breaking and
forward thinking techno characterized by unique syncopation and a rich
melodic sensibility.  His recent downtempo and hip hop productions have
caught the eye of the Good Looking Organization label head LTJ Bukem, who
quickly signed Charles to his labels' roster of talent.  His first release
for Bukem appeared on the Good Looking downtempo sub-label Cookin' Records
with fellow Columbus artist M.C. L. Black.  In addition, Charles has
recently started 21/22 Corporation sub-label Glyph, and completed his fourth
tour of Europe, as well as a tour of Japan.  He has also performed at the
legendary Barcelona Sonar festival, Chicago's Red No. 5, Detroit's Motor,
and the Eyes Only afterparty at the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.  At
Proceed Charles will perform a exclusive and rare Downtempo and Broken Beat
live p.a. as Archetype.

  Co-founder of Columbus based and internationally renown Residual
Recordings and veteran Columbus promoter and DJ, Thomas James will be
providing an opening DJ set as well as interludes between the evening's live

I made this a few weeks ago hurriedly before i went on vacation, and i 
know it isnt a gem of a track (yet), but I wouldnt mind some feedback 
it. It needs more percussion and dancefloor fillin', if u know what i 
mean, and def have to fix some of the plugins and master it slightly. I 
more a less just put it up to test the waters of my shitty mp3.com 
account, but it def is different, so give it a sec...

Here is da link, and there is only the one song to stream (lo-fi or 
hi-fi):

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} label thanks

Thanks Doug!

We had such debaucherous fun putting the party on!  We'll probably do 
another one in a few months - a *wee* bit more extravigant ;)  Of course 
I'll keep the list updated.  It was quite nice seeing everyone, though I 
wish I got to chat more...

There is a new PVD track this week, but I don't know if that is the one or
not.

But I will say that I think it is funny that people are making a big deal
out of this.  The speed garage mixes of puffy's earlier stuff were realeased
in the US on Bad Boy in 96... they weren't bootlegs.  Puffy has been down
with dance music since his beginning.

No, fuck Bluelight.nu. Does anybody have the scoop on this story?

By the way, I find it amusing that someone who is into EDM would criticise
the extensive sampling and reworking strategies of the Bad Boy label.

Enjoy postmodernism in all its glory.

Subject: {pb-cle} technical itch in cincy review

it was a great show, it was at some venue called 1120 which was not the 
biggest place in the world, but since there wasn't a really huge turnout 
there was just enough space to dance. the sound was really great by the 
stage and real mellow by the bar, what a great idea! also i'd like to 
commend the place for having the largest shot glasses i've seen in a while.
we caught the very end of dom & roland's set, so  can't really comment 
on it, but tech itch really tore it up. voight kamph was great too, but 
their set was cut short by equpment problems.
the downstairs had hip-hop and some comfy couches

overall a great night, cincy is a cool place

Anyone know some good places to stay in Detroit? I've looked around but it always seems that experience is best way to tell. Anyone have any good/bad experiences they could share? I've never been and any tips would be great.

there's most likely a reason for all that. I know we've made reservations
for the Marriott Renaissance (spelled that wrong I think) again, but the
Court Yard still has openings. =)

Who's all going down this year anyways?. I'm sure I'll probably see the same
crew I saw the 2 years I've gone.....

{{ Paul Berezansky <paulberezansky@iname.com> }
it was a great show, it was at some venue called 1120 which was not the
biggest place in the world, but since there wasn't a really huge turnout
there was just enough space to dance. the sound was really great by the
stage and real mellow by the bar, what a great idea! also i'd like to
commend the place for having the largest shot glasses i've seen in a
while. }}

Yes. They do you right at 1120. And I guess it's not as bad as I was saying
before. The basement of 1120 is always the place to be.

{{ Paul Berezansky <paulberezansky@iname.com> }
we caught the very end of dom & roland's set, so can't really comment on it,
but tech itch really tore it up. voight kamph was great too, but their set
was cut short by equpment problems. the downstairs had hip-hop and some
comfy couches overall a great night, }}

The funny part is how I didn't know about this (not that I'd have gone). I'm
so out of touch. I was there for Goldie and Donald Glaude on friday night
but had to kind of cut that short.

cincy is a cool place }}

Not really. Sometimes it's okay, but I like Cleveland better. Lots of snotty
fucks in 513 get on my gritty blue-collar nerves. I'm just the son of a
carpenter.

And when am I going to meet this elusive Daniel Hitchcock?
