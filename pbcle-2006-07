Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Doormouse in Pittsburgh.  I cant do that again.  Last time I left
Pittsburgh with 11 stiches in my ear.  Damn that steel city brew.
There is good reason I dont drink anymore.

Subject: {pb-cle} Tonight Phil K at Altar Bar

Phil K (Australia, Melbourne) - (Nu-Breed, Y4K, tca-web.com)

Monday, July 3, 2006

One of Australia's major national newspapers published a story on Phil K a
coon's age ago. The excerpt attempted to capture the essence of the man
that leads the breakbeat bombardment from the land down below. When
questioned about his motivations in life, Phil K shrugged nonchalantly and
mentioned that he just wanted to make music.. Nine years later he's still
making beats. and he's making them well.

The term "pioneer" is brandied about too readily in dance music; however,
for this man, there is no other word in the English language to summarize
what he has done. Born, bred, and based in Melbourne, Phil has been
racking up frequent flyer miles since '85; dropping wicked progressive
house and breakbeats like it's his family business.. If I were you, I'd do
myself a favor and kiss-up to my boss now. You may need a couple of extra
hours sleep to rest your tired feet come July 5th.

Also featuring:
Matt Monroe (Dynamix Crew, SoulGlo)
DJ Quartz (Dynamix Crew)

Downstairs in the lounge:
DJ GH (Globalbeats.com)
DJ Underground (DigitalGoodtime.com)

Steve Simpson of the DynamixCrew would like to invite you to come
celebrate our nation's independence at Altar Bar for yet another evening
of upfront, forward-thinking music. Your old perception of club music is
about to go up in smoke.

You know there is an old tune by White Zombie called "Blood, Milk, and Sky". 
Great tune, but...

Its really about paratrooper badgers from outerspace eviscerating the human 
race. That rhyme was actually deleted from the original lyrics; I thought I 
would share this engaging bit of information.

Thanks for reminding me, Todd!


What a horrible night to have a curse.

EXP038 - MILES TILLMAN - MELT LP
http://www.experimedia.net/page.php?id=117


For his full-length release at Experimedia, Miles Tilmann gives us a
collection of both old and new tracks. Covering mostly ambient
territory, and similar to his work on Toytronic's 3D Concepts series.
Gracefully mastered by Brian Grainger, these archived pieces are warm,
bubbly and spacious. Melt is the aural equivalent of bathing in hot
springs deep inside immense caverns, perfect for a warm summer drive
or a cozy night indoors. Intimate, evocative and yet very distant at
the same time. Classic melodic ambient at it's best, with a bonus
remix by Milieu.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Important Announcement

All,

Something was released this week that I believe can have a substantial
effect on the
direction that politics in our country can take.  We are now part of
the information age where we rely on computers more for information
than we do from any other source.  The founder of Wikipedia has
launched a new site aimed at correcting politics through intelligent
collaboration.  The mission statement is here:

http://campaigns.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Statement

the site is here:

http://campaigns.wikia.com

I hope that this may spark interest in some of you as I know it has
sparked my own interest.

Thanks for lending your ear, you may now return to your online
shopping and forwarding of chain letters.

-Goose

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

with John K

Hailing from Houston, Texas, Henry Chow brings a fresh new sound to the 
international Techno community. Behind his calm facade, Chow - also 
using the .Stealth. moniker in local scene - was developing a technique 
that would create an outlet and make people feel that he had spoken his 
peace. The Chinese-American Henry Chow began his ventures into a DJ 
persona in late 1996. Initially, he was unable to categorize his 
efforts. However, this detriment proved to bless Chow with the 
background necessary to present his preferred style openly. Being 
influenced by the hip hop culture at an early age, Henry wanted new mix 
tapes to breakdance to so he found himself buying two turntables and a 
load of hip hop classics. After several trips to the local vinyl shops, 
Henry opened his mind to other forms of music and began experimenting 
with drum & bass, house and eventually techno.

It was through techno that Chow felt he could move the crowd. "Techno 
has no boundaries. Being repetitive and minimal, It was no secret that 
techno was made for manipulation. It's all about manipulation; 
Manipulating the tracks and the crowd,. says Henry Chow. Debuting to 
Houston masses at a Lone Star Arena rave, the Stealth was no longer 
covert after a bangin. crafty set.

By 1999 Henry Chow joined forces with Steve Sheffield and long time 
friends, Fernando Cortez and Thomas Cauley, and the four DJs created the 
Houston-based Tek-Xupport. The techno clique soon began taking over the 
airwaves on Friday nights on the local KTRU 91.7 FM .MK Ultra. program, 
which showcases local talent to the masses or those within range. It was 
within this earshot that Chow sought to expand. Ultimately, Tek-Xupport 
combined forces with Jeff Fleischmann and his 713Tekno project. In a 
colliding of minds, a true force to be reckoned with has emerged. Now a 
staple of the burgeoning Houston techno scene, Henry Chow, Tek-Xupport 
and 713Tekno create an innovative outlet needed to move techno up to the 
top more prominently.
 
Shortly after, Chow and 713Tekno brought their sound to Hardrive.s Club 
Karma and established a monthly residence. Adjusting his, now, versatile 
style, Chow brought his offensive to a string of local underground 
warehouse parties, where the acoustics also hollered for techno to 
resound, and spilling techno throughout the surrounding blocks. With 
growing support, Chow was able to feed the techno masses as Static 
Wednesdays' techno resident at Houston's premiere nightclub Hyperia.
 
Fully realizing the potential of his furtive movements and in furthering 
the Stealth moniker, he felt that there was a need to write and produce 
to keep the music fresh and alive in Houston. After about three years of 
writing and producing techno music, in late 2003, Chow signed on with 
Marco Carola and Corrado Izzo's Zenit imprint.  ©Fahrenheit-media.com,

The Twelfth Annual World Electronic Music Festival

DESTINY 55
FRIDAY . SATURDAY . SUNDAY
July 21-23, 2006
ONTARIO, CANADA
www.wemf.com - 416-631-8821


The 3-Day Experience
The 12th Annual World Electronic Music Festival or simply the .3-Day. as
it.s become known over the years, is the 2006 installment of the largest
and longest running event of its kind in Canada. With a rich variety of
music, artists, performers and music lovers from around the world, it is
an experience that is unique and enduring for all those who have made it
part of their lives.

It is the 3-Day Experience that we invite you to enjoy once more and
potentially one last time. After searching across the province the WEMF
collective has chosen a site that will allow it to create an event that
is true to the roots of where WEMF came from and what it has become. A
remote, forested campground, located on a crystal clear lakefront will
bring all the music back outside where it belongs. Camping, dancing,
enjoying the company of friends and everything else that the 3-Day
Experience allows can only be enhanced by the presence of the sun and
the stars!

With this return to nature, we are also transforming the 3-Day
Experience to a themed environment that will create a completely new
level of connection and interaction with the music, the land and each
other. In 2006 all stages will be themed. Travel through the experience
by Air, Sea, Land and Space. Travel into your Mind and through Time into
the future. We invite those new and old to join us for a completely
fresh but quite likely final, 3-Day Experience!

Fri Jul 28                          CHUNK                         Cleveland

With the electronic dance music scene back on the rise in Ohio, TRU & 
DISCO productions feel that it is about that time to bring the noise 
harder than we ever have in these parts with an enormous event that is 
sure to rock your shit for 12 straight hours and guarantee you will 
remember this night for the rest of your lives! Of course Michael Mellon 
of TRU Productions and the legendary Disco Donnie of DISCO Productions 
are known around the nation for producing massive headliner events that 
cater to thousands, but this event right here, .CHUNK. is on another 
level. We are taking it back to the old school this time. We are proud 
to be working on this event with both Koala-Tea and ANM Productions to 
bring you what is set to be a 2000+ person event. And, maybe, the most 
talked-about event set for 2006!

We have 3 rooms of straight TURBO SOUND, unlimited amounts of production 
including the sickest light, laser and visuals show that will 100% fuck 
your mind up and take you on a major euphoric journey. Not to mention, 
METROPOLIS NIGHTCLUB. This venue is legendary! Cleveland.s 
longest-lasting superclub which has just been re-vamped with a brand new 
hardwood dance floor, new carpet and furniture; the VIP area cannot get 
any nicer. Did I mention the massive TURBO SOUND RIG and the hundreds of 
moving lights and lasers in a 20,000 square foot venue?

Get ready people, here it is! We are proud to bring you an event of this 
status with 5 major headliners on the bill alongside the best local and 
regional talent in the nation! Set this date aside, you know you want 
to. Make sure you get your tickets while they are HOT! We are releasing 
a very limited amount at a very cheap price to hook ya.ll up. After 
those sell out the price goes up. Tickets will be available on-line at 
WWW.WANTICKETS.COM or at GRAND POO-BAS RECORD SHOPPE located in 
Lakewood, Ohio on Detroit Rd. up until 5pm the day of the event.

See you all at CHUNK! Getcha truffle shuffle on! -PEACE

My car has decided that it doesn't like 2nd gear any more, so it's kinda hard to drive it now.. and it's way expensive to repair.
   
  So, I am suddenly forced to look for other transport to and from CDG.  I might be able to get a ride there with family, but I don't know how I'm getting back.
   
  Anybody from columbus or points south got space in their car for one lonely DJ and a couple record bags?

well I got all my stuff tweaked and setup for tomorro.  Got the
compressor setup so it shouldn't even compress it any until it goes over
0db mark.  So to any dj's playing, as long as you don't see two yellow
bars on the mixer it shouldn't sound like ass.

Subject: {pb-cle} CDG thanks

Thanks to those that were in attendance for CDG 4, I had a good time
and think that most others did as well.  Even though it may have been
lacking the older flavor of debauchery of other cdg's, it was still a
fun time.  Special thanks to all the people that drove for hours to
make it (sean alderman from dc, tim and grandpa from cincy, lemma from
columbus, and all the pittsburgh yinzers.)

Chick fookin' poked me in the eye, lil' twat.

I did get a return spank on Stacy, but methinks it might have been more fun
had I hiked up her skirt a bit first.

Did get to spend $100 for a 6 hr. stay in a decent hotel room, tho *eye
roll*.

I am mad there were no tittays released.  I am, however, too damn old
anymore.

Nah - That wasn't her.

Like - Some dude parked his car on the side of ours to where ours was 
blocked in. I had asked them when they came towards the house if they 
didn't mind moving it so we could leave later and the guy basically told 
me to fuck off. I got pissed and told him not to be surprised if he 
found his windshield busted when he came out...  That's what started 
that..  but whatever - The chick that was with him mouthed off to me and 
I went back at her.

Loved the pool session man - I didn't want to get out!

Also was nice seeing and meeting a lot of you guys.

I was also displeased by the lack of bare boobage at the party.  I don't think I've ever managed to be around for boob flashing at any CDG parties, and I was hoping to change that.  Boo.  I did however get to see two of the hottest girls at the party making out, even if I only caught the last couple seconds of it.

And there were girls in bikinis at the pool, freezing their butts off.  I thought the water was nice, myself, but I'm pretty tolerant of cool water.

Music was good at the party, although I'm scared to hear what the recording of my set was like.  Drinking strongbow before my set and spinning a bunch of records I've barely gotten to listen to myself might have been a bad idea... but a couple people seemed to be groovin on it, so it's all good.

Good to see a variety of list types and non list types as well.. AManda and Dave, Grandpa, Paul, Ridley, Todd, Goose, Trout, Liz, Genevive, Jes, Nox a ton of people whose names I forgot, a ton of people I'm just not thinking of offhand because I suck as listing names.....

And Stacy walkin around with the paddle was pretty menacing, but hot at the same time...

Damn, I didn't even get to see two hot girls making out.  Yeah I was  
disappointed by the lack of debauchery as well.  Just thing too much  
stuff happened at the last one.  Although it seemed like nothing  
really debaucherous happened.  It just seemed like a house party..  
not like that's a bad thing or anything

Yeah, the pool definately made the night more interesting.  With all  
the "you go in the pool, no you go in the pool" arguments.  I thought  
the water was fine myself, as well.  Just a little cold but not  
ZOMGWTFBBQPIE cold.  Even with several women claiming to take it all  
off and jump in, no one ever did.  Although one guy did, whatever his  
name was.

Yeah, I tried to be somewhat on top of that.  a couple times I didn't  
stop and start the next recording at the right spot, but I should be  
able to figure out.  At a couple points though I just said screw it  
and had it record like two people's sets without stopping.

I hope to go through them tonight (go through the quickly while I can  
still kinda make a mental note as to where each one stopped) and at  
least get them tracked out properly and then as long as I don't hear  
any horrible f'ups I'll post them somewhere.  The other's I'll do  
some sort of FLAC encoding or something and give it to the DJs if  
they want to do some "rework" on the mix to take out the "audio  
glitches".

Yeah, whoever I met there, most I think I already forgot the names  
though.  Although I did finally witness the creation of the grandpa  
special punch.

naw, it was more or less menacing, had to keep guard at all times as  
she kept watching for the opportunity to get me. :)

Yeah I didn't post anything sunday since I ended up just getting  
home, dropping off all my stuff in the basement, taking a shower and  
passing out on the bed for like 14 hours :)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} cdg

Yeah as far as parties go it was OK... As far as a PBCLE party I
thought it mostly sucked.

It seemed like there were way too many
"neighborhood-moron-with-no-money-whats-pbcle?-lets-put-on-some-rock-or-hiphop-give-me-your-beer-and-drugs-show-me-your-tits"
types.

It seemed like there were at least a dozen obnoxious asses just going
from girl to girl harassing them and saying ignorant shit. Half of my
night was spent listening to girls / guys complaining about them, and
avoiding them myself.

The one asshole in particular with the white shirt and blue cap, eyes
sunk back in his head with black eyesockets, I think his name was
"junkie joe" or something like that... I think he pissed off almost
everyone there, most of us more than once... I found a corner to try
and discreetly do my expensive partying material, and he managed to
yell across the room "Is that _ _ _ _ (expensive stuff) or _ _ _ _ _ _
_ ? (cheap stuff)"... so I ignored him, then he repeated it over and
over... after about the 7th time when he was yelling it so loud that
everyone in the room was looking at me, I finally yelled back "What
fucking difference does it make, you're not getting any either way"...
After that he tried to get threatning towards me by picking up the bat
and slapping it in his hand over and over while giving me threatning
looks. I think trout was pissed when junkie just ended up on the
tables with trouts records somehow, didnt even ask. Fucker raided my
cooler and drank my pepsis... Probably one of the most annoying things
about him was having to listen to person after person come up to me
and complain about shit he did. Final straw was around 8pm the next
day, only about 6 of us left partying, I went to the store and bought
a gatorade, came back put it in the fridge to cool it down, went to
get it out an hour later and it was gone, caught him drinking it. I
went off,  yelled in his face at full volume, spit flying, told him he
was an asshole and a thief, and nobody liked him... It was pretty much
the first time I had wanted someone to try and hit me in about 10
years.  I figured he would after having threatned me earlier, but then
he didn't have the pbcle bat in his hand this time. After I unloaded,
I left... (Damien was pretty shocked to witness this, it was kinda
funny, he looked kinda pumped up, ready for shit to go down.)

Anyhow, I somehow managed to not meet a single person from the list
that I didn't already know. I got sick of asking "Are you from pbcle?"
and getting stupid stares followed by "whats pbcle?".

Aside from that, I had a good time partying, and was glad to see a few
cool ppl that I know from the scene. I don't think I'll be going to
any more house parties at this house though. I mentioned it to stacy
that the junkie guy was an asshole and pissing everyone off. She was
like "Oh I know you dont have to tell me", so I was like "What does it
take to get rid of him?" she was like "Oh man u dont wanna know". A
house party really needs a host that's with it and ready to kick out
the assholes, or preferrably ROAR them in the first place. Nothing
against stacy cause I love her, but I've seen it before that when you
let the freeloaders and assholes keep coming back, eventually the
people that are bringing the good times and good stuff will get sick
of it and not come back, meanwhile, the freeloaders spread the word,
and take over. The difference between trouts bday party there and this
party there was a clear down-hill. The plan of "Lets close all the
doors and windows even though we dont have AC and it's 100 degrees in
here with over 100 ppl partying" was idiocy at best.

Sorry for all the negativity, but there wasn't too much positive stuff
to write about.

I think I was the first one OUT of the pool. Dave and I got a lot of water
up our noses and now he has the sniffles. I was just freezing, and I'm not
the biggest fan of swimming in the first place.

Haha, that was Joey. I invited him and his friend Tina to the party after
randomly meeting them at Annabell's Wednesday night. Neither one of them
have ever been to a rave. When they first showed up, Tina was completely
shocked that "There are actual DJ's [there]!!!" I'm glad they both seemed
to have a good time.

I completely missed Dave Atkinson's set 'cause I'm a bitch and wasn't
there yet. Then I got into Sonique's lil' booty grind, and totally rocked
out to Two's set later on. Everyone was good, I just wasn't usually in
that room.

You never played Sandstorm for me!!! :D

After the party I kept getting all these emails, texts and calls about a
"lost girl" who was last seen with my brother. Yeah, she and Mike slept in
Dave's and my bed all day Sunday. I guess neither of them thought it'd be
prudent to let a *single* friend of hers know she was crashing here. Sorry
about that little scare - we didn't know she was smuggled goods!

So I guess he was going around telling people he was the actual Goose that
CDG is named for. Silly poser! "Goose" has been his nickname for years and
he was blown away that there was another Goose there, but whatever. He was
tripping balls too.

Sorry to stir things up so much... Apparently your bro squirted way
(10 times) too much of a liquid substance with a 3 letter chemical
code without warning into at least one person's mouth, (one who was
also a good male friend of the girl who came up missing) and when that
girl came up missing, and had left all her stuff in our car, we (and
her boyfriend) became concerned when we heard that she went home with
'the mouth squirter' in an extremely altered state of mind... We all
tried to call her all the next day and she wasn't answering the phone.
The next thing you know people are talking about whether her body
would be found diced up or not... hehe. Adrienne and I felt somewhat
responsible since we had given her a ride to the party. It turned out
she came back right around 9pm sunday, and wasn't actually diced up :)

It kinda bummed our night, and sunday... I was torn between thinking
"shes so damn irresponsible" and dumping her belongings on the
driveway in front of the house, and "we should probably call the cops
before the guy has time to rent a woodchipper and dispose of the
body". With all the freaks at that party it was hard not to think of
the latter.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} cdg

OK, first off, if that dude was that threating to someone, he should  
have gotten booted out.  Litterally.  There's enough big dudes there  
that if that happens to someone again let us know, and we'll round up  
a group to drag the person's ass out the door (and yes, if there were  
a few of us I would have gone up against a guy with a bat, I was  
drunk after all).  It's fine if the host, for whatever reason, can  
not or does not feel comfortable kicking someone out.  But I've never  
been to a house party where the host doesn't have a lot of friends  
there where if they said "look, this dude is being a dick and I don't  
feel comfortable handling it on my own, can you guys help?"  I could  
have thought of a couple people that would have dropped everything to  
help out.

Also, I think the problem was too many non pb-cle'ers.  I was even  
guilty of inviting someone that wasn't directly related to pb-cle and  
wasn't closely related to me like a girlfriend or best friend or  
anything.  It really should have been litterally a pb-cle only  
event.  CDG3 might have had, what, 25 people there? but they were all  
people directly on the list (or signficant others of people on the  
list).  There was too many "hey, there's a house party tonight" type  
people.  I hardly talked to anyone but the couple dozen people that  
were from the list or party kids I've seen in PGH.

Also my hypothesis for the reason all the non debauchery was the lack  
of hard liquour.  This occured to me when talking to trout about how  
he missed all the debauchery at the last one after that cup of  
jager.  Even CDG2 had jager, and again just had maybe 25 or so  
people.  I think there were too many non-pbcle people there and just  
having more people made it harder to become "intimate" (no pun  
intended) with people because you could only really talk to a small  
subset of them.

If there's another one, it should definately be STRICTLY invite only  
and absolutely no one not directly invited is allowed to come.   
Including spouses and such unless directly authorized by the CIA  
operatives and everyone should be told not to bring anyone else with  
them or expected to be booted out.  If that means there's only 12  
people there, and it's BYOE (bring your own everything).  I think  
once you have a really small group of people you're forced to talk to  
them longer and could possibly make things lead to debauchery status  
sooner.

And yeah, I don't who it was but someone I had no clue was using my  
headphones which kinda annoyed me beacuse "he just grabbed them" but  
then when the cops came he just rolled them into a ball and stretched  
out the coiled cord which is what really pissed me off.  If you  
fucking use someone else's gear, don't thrash it around.  It's pretty  
much ruined my trust of letting other people use my stuff.  My mixer  
has also gotten the most abuse after this one.  One of the fader  
sliders is extremely loose (nothing some tape won't fix) that wasn't  
before.  The little cardboard pieces I had over the bpm counters went  
MIA.  I think it was too many people that don't know how to respect  
people's equipment to know that you don't jab the slider back and  
forth and that if it's something covered up it probably is for a  
reason.  At trout's bday party, when it was just the few djs that  
were scheduled and maybe just a couple other people that just brought  
records, the biggest damage I got was some ash on the mixer, which I  
fully expected and a burst of canned air fixed without problems.

I guess just learn from mistakes.  make it strictly invite only,  
don't just open up the decks but ok it through someone before  
bringing your records, and close the pool at night as it just tends  
to get a little loud :)

Is he in Tim's pix? Which guy is he?

There were a couple shady types who stood out like sore thumbs to Dave and
me, but no single person was the worst ... OTHER than the piece of shit
who ripped me off for the smallest ass .5g of speed I've ever been able to
do in one line -- and who promptly fell asleep on the couch after doing
his own shit! Damian kindly offered to kick his ass for me, and my brother
would have KILLED him, THEN TAKEN all his drugs and money if I'd have told
him, but I didn't want to cause any trouble at Stacy's house with fighting
so I accepted my loss and went on. Blah. I guess gettin' ripped off for
drugs makes it seem like the good ol' days of weekly raving, anyway. Good
times, good times.

We brought four bottles of gatorade, three blue and one red. I only saw
half of one bottle all night. At least someone was well-hydrated!

Wow, my brother's been called a lot of things, but "the mouth squirter" is
pretty damn fucking hilarious. I know one chick towards the time people
started leaving kept begging him for more and more drops, and she kept
losing her $5 bill. Again, good times, good times.

Yeah, when he was acting threatning towards me it was still early in
the party... I felt a bit guilty for embarassing him in front of a ton
of people, and hadn't yet heard the gamut of complaints about him. I
feel a little wierd about kicking someone out of someone else's house
as well... I tried to broach the subject with stacy later, but she
seemed uninterested.

Haha, I brought the snortable sexual lubricant, and distributed it to
any female that seemed interested, but it didn't seem to work all that
well. I think the girls were chaining up their panties after the gang
of obnoxious guys going around... All the cameras seemed to make girls
shy as well. Guys those need to be hidden until absolutely needed! I
tried to talk my Amanda into getting the debauchery started, and had
no luck! I also tried to talk my wife into helping get it started, no
luck there either... She did make a little concession, although I
think no one actually saw that. (hay if you did please dont post it on
the list lol!)

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} cdg

it wasnt a cook da goose.

all the points that everyone has made are all valid.  i take a lot of
the blame for having it at stacy's place (who isnt really involved
with the scene, but has a lot of really shady friends) ... i didnt
expect her to invite everyone on her myspace list... when trout told
me she was going to invite some people, i was cool with it cause i
figured it was her place after all and there is little that can be
done when that was the chosen venue.

invite only was the way that trout and I did it from the beginning, we
had about 28 people on the evite that were coming (probably 20
listee's / scene people)... then all the sudden it became a free for
all house party - one of the reasons that i kind of just gave up at
4am and went to sleep for 4 hours, it was all crackheaded out.

but on the good side of things, dan kelly has expressed interest in
doing something here in pittsburgh sometime in the next year (call it
Cook da Goose 4.5: Cuz 4.0 was like Millenium Edition Windows)...
strictly invite to fill the void of vibe that was sucked out.

another thing that i also thought about over the past day is that the
previous CDG's were very influenced by alcohol... yeah, sure amanda is
always gonna do some drugs :), but it had been grey goose / jager /
keg of beer intoxication.  i really didnt care much for the farmers
market of drugs that was going on.  bring your own drugs, do them
discreetly, and dont make it your personal marketplace.

yeah, that junkie jake guy was a douche... all morning sunday he kept
asking for a ride for 10 bucks so he could go home to get records... i
kept saying no.  as did everyone else.

The guy you have listed as Damion was actually the junkie guy if I'm
not mistaken. (the one with his middle fingers up in the 4th pic, he's
also in the back in the 3rd pic and front and center humping a baloon
in the 5th pic (I'd guess he's trying to impress that girl).

Let it be known that Adrienne, Dan's wife, was the only person at this
party who not only saw but felt my tits. No one else was around, though,
since she was peeing and I was changing back into dry clothes in the

Todd done wrote this shit:

Also my hypothesis for the reason all the non debauchery was the lack  
of hard liquour.  This occured to me when talking to trout about how  
he missed all the debauchery at the last one after that cup of  
jager.  Even CDG2 had jager, and again just had maybe 25 or so  
people.  I think there were too many non-pbcle people there and just  
having more people made it harder to become "intimate" (no pun  
intended) with people because you could only really talk to a small  
subset of them.


So I dun said:

Hey, I did my part, we brought a bottle of Jager, but no one would drink it
with us.  And since I wasn't sure what time I was spinning, I paced myself
drinking so I didn't pull a Keoki and pass out on the decks in
mid-trainwreck.  Didn't help that all the shade (and the cats) made Lindy
feel uncomfortable, so her girls weren't gonna come out an play, and she
wasn't down to pound a few shots.

I didn't know of said jager, I would have done a shot or two.  Heck  
when we doing shots of everclear I ended up with water since I think  
we miscalculated the number of people.  although that could be a fun  
game of russian rullet.  make all glasses but one water and make the  
other everclear.

Agreed. It was just a house party.

I had a good time and I was glad to see some faces from yesteryear, but 
the mix of people was kinda sketchy and there was a distinct feeling of 
two different parties going on. Putting a moratorium on the front and 
back yards really hurt. I was about to leave until I realized that it 
was cool to be outside again as long as the noise level was respectable. 
Stacy is pretty cool, especially for letting all those people trash her 
place.

Gina, Jake, Justin, Sean, Jenn, Aleks, Jessica, Jea, Cos, Dave, Tim, Ed, 
Todd, Andy, Amanda, Denae, Paul, Trout - big shouts and Pubicle love.

Ed, slap a coat of varnish on that paddle and hold onto it for CDG XP. 
I'll be there as usual.

Subject: {pb-cle} "Camping?"

Not really though.

A few of us discussed it briefly at CDG. I want to gauge interest in a 
lodge stay in Hocking Hills later on this summer into fall. I've done 
this before and the whole area is beautiful. There's tons of hiking and 
outdoor stuff to do and it's a lot of fun.

Count on it costing around $150 per person for a 2-night stay (friday 
through sunday). This usually includes the lodge and/or cabin(s) with 
towels an'at, but obviously no food (we'd be grillin' up some mean 
feasts though). These places all have normal bathrooms, kitchens and 
grills, and hottubs too. Hocking Hills is the hottub capital of Ohio and 
perhaps all the midwest (whatever). I found a couple of lodges that even 
have beautiful private inground pools but there were some fine-print 
items that I'm needing to clarify.

A get-together, in the vein of CDG2 perhaps, no more than 3 hours away 
from anyone who'd be reading this but lasting a couple days.

These lodges, they typically will sleep somewhere from 10 to 20 people. 
If the interest (and I mean real interest - "here's my money let's do 
it" kind of interest) exceeds that capacity then satellite cabins are 
available at most of these sites at around the same per-person cost. In 
other words, if there are 30 people who want to do this, then 15 of them 
might be partying at the lodge then retiring to private quarters.

So... who's down for real?
J.[M]

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

with John K

Hailing from Houston, Texas, Henry Chow brings a fresh new sound to the 
international Techno community. Behind his calm facade, Chow - also 
using the .Stealth. moniker in local scene - was developing a technique 
that would create an outlet and make people feel that he had spoken his 
peace. The Chinese-American Henry Chow began his ventures into a DJ 
persona in late 1996. Initially, he was unable to categorize his 
efforts. However, this detriment proved to bless Chow with the 
background necessary to present his preferred style openly. Being 
influenced by the hip hop culture at an early age, Henry wanted new mix 
tapes to breakdance to so he found himself buying two turntables and a 
load of hip hop classics. After several trips to the local vinyl shops, 
Henry opened his mind to other forms of music and began experimenting 
with drum & bass, house and eventually techno.

It was through techno that Chow felt he could move the crowd. "Techno 
has no boundaries. Being repetitive and minimal, It was no secret that 
techno was made for manipulation. It's all about manipulation; 
Manipulating the tracks and the crowd,. says Henry Chow. Debuting to 
Houston masses at a Lone Star Arena rave, the Stealth was no longer 
covert after a bangin. crafty set.

By 1999 Henry Chow joined forces with Steve Sheffield and long time 
friends, Fernando Cortez and Thomas Cauley, and the four DJs created the 
Houston-based Tek-Xupport. The techno clique soon began taking over the 
airwaves on Friday nights on the local KTRU 91.7 FM .MK Ultra. program, 
which showcases local talent to the masses or those within range. It was 
within this earshot that Chow sought to expand. Ultimately, Tek-Xupport 
combined forces with Jeff Fleischmann and his 713Tekno project. In a 
colliding of minds, a true force to be reckoned with has emerged. Now a 
staple of the burgeoning Houston techno scene, Henry Chow, Tek-Xupport 
and 713Tekno create an innovative outlet needed to move techno up to the 
top more prominently.
 
Shortly after, Chow and 713Tekno brought their sound to Hardrive.s Club 
Karma and established a monthly residence. Adjusting his, now, versatile 
style, Chow brought his offensive to a string of local underground 
warehouse parties, where the acoustics also hollered for techno to 
resound, and spilling techno throughout the surrounding blocks. With 
growing support, Chow was able to feed the techno masses as Static 
Wednesdays' techno resident at Houston's premiere nightclub Hyperia.
 
Fully realizing the potential of his furtive movements and in furthering 
the Stealth moniker, he felt that there was a need to write and produce 
to keep the music fresh and alive in Houston. After about three years of 
writing and producing techno music, in late 2003, Chow signed on with 
Marco Carola and Corrado Izzo's Zenit imprint.  ©Fahrenheit-media.com,

The 3-Day Experience
The 12th Annual World Electronic Music Festival or simply the .3-Day. as
it.s become known over the years, is the 2006 installment of the largest
and longest running event of its kind in Canada. With a rich variety of
music, artists, performers and music lovers from around the world, it is
an experience that is unique and enduring for all those who have made it
part of their lives.

It is the 3-Day Experience that we invite you to enjoy once more and
potentially one last time. After searching across the province the WEMF
collective has chosen a site that will allow it to create an event that
is true to the roots of where WEMF came from and what it has become. A
remote, forested campground, located on a crystal clear lakefront will
bring all the music back outside where it belongs. Camping, dancing,
enjoying the company of friends and everything else that the 3-Day
Experience allows can only be enhanced by the presence of the sun and
the stars!

With this return to nature, we are also transforming the 3-Day
Experience to a themed environment that will create a completely new
level of connection and interaction with the music, the land and each
other. In 2006 all stages will be themed. Travel through the experience
by Air, Sea, Land and Space. Travel into your Mind and through Time into
the future. We invite those new and old to join us for a completely
fresh but quite likely final, 3-Day Experience!

moving lights and lasers in a 20,000 square foot venue?

Get ready people, here it is! We are proud to bring you an event of this 
status with 5 major headliners on the bill alongside the best local and 
regional talent in the nation! Set this date aside, you know you want

DOMINIK EULBERG . TRAUM, COCOON (Cologne, Germany)
Without any doubt this guy is today.s hottest new commodity in the 
techno soundscape. DOMINIK EULBERG makes his first appearance in Detroit 
and will surely have in his crate those diamond hard beats and 
crystalline dancefloor shapes that he.s so well known for. Them 
Pitchfork folks can.t stop saying great things about him . we can 
guarantee to expect nothing less than floor-frying techno from this guy!

ADA . AREAL RECORDS (Cologne, Germany)
The chanteuse of the AREAL collective, ADA has won the hearts of many 
with her unique ability to fuse the minimalist thump with the allurement 
of songwriting. Her debut full length .BLONDIE. speaks volumes . more 
than a divider at a record store, or a file to be downloaded, ADA is 
truly today.s techno-pop star.

Opening a night full of musical and artistic bliss:

Phatts McNatt (Live Drum & Bass / Breakbeat / Funk)

Read on from their MySpace profile:
A two man group that got this distinctive sound by conglomerating a vast 
amount of their influences into a funnel that is constantly evolving and 
digesting their musical hypotheses. They have taken different recipes 
from the Red hots, Fishbone and Primus. They have then taken aromatic 
and flavorfull spices from all around the world from the likes of Aierto 
Moreira, Ray Brown, Horacio Hernandez, Herbie Hancock, The Police, Bob 
Marley and the Wailers, Aphex Twin, Parliament, Bootsy Collins, Trilok 
Gurtu, DJ Shadow, Miles Davis, Freddy Hubbard, Eric Dolphy, Bjork, 
Living Colour, Paul chambers, Elvin Jones, Kenny Garret, Steve Gadd, 
Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Dre and Snoop, along with many, many others - 
construing them together ending up in a thick, chowder-like mass of 
groove oriented , wrongfully right, high octane sounds.

Artist Biography: Dustin Zahn

After being influenced by mix-tapes of artists such as Richie Hawtin, 
Dustin began writing music purely for fun. Dustin met future-partner Ian 
Lehman, who was established in the mid-west rave scene. Ian explained to 
him that music similar to his was played at parties called raves. Ian 
invited him to one of his shows and Dustin took his offer to see what he 
was talking about. After being exposed to just one party, Dustin knew 
this was his future. He started doing Live PA.s at various local parties 
and quickly became a favorite. After a year Dustin stepped up to the 
decks and won just as much respect as he did with his productions.

    In early 2001, Dustin and Ian both agreed to take things to the next 
level. They put a halt on bookings and concentrated on the studio. A 
year later their work had emerged onto vinyl and all over the internet, 
creating a serious buzz. Abiotic was born and the duo formed The Attack 
People.

A few words can easily describe Dustin Zahn's style: moody, tribal, 
dark, and hypnotic. Since Dustin co-founded Abiotic Recordings with Ian 
Lehman in 2001, he's finished projects for labels such as Invasion, 
Mankind, Compound, GFR, Humanoid, and many other labels. His tracks have 
received support from techno DJs such as Adam Beyer, Ben Sims, Chris 
Liebing, Dave Clarke, Umek, Cari Lekebusch, Patrik Skoog, and countless 
more. Together with partner Ian Lehman they perform a Live PA under the 
moniker "The Attack People." A project concentrating on moody, 
futuristic funk for both the mind and dance floor. Zahn is also known 
for his diverse DJ sets which have brought him all over the U.S., to 
Europe, and South America.

Ive been noticing a bit of bad feelings in the scene lately so we at 
goodvibes decided that its time for another go, another reminder that 
the vibe is still here, that it doesnt have to be found in a warehouse 
or under a bridge. It can still be found right here. Its the people that 
make the vibe, not the venue. So I urge you, once again and feel the 
vibe. No drama, no hate, just old fashioned good vibes.

Subject: {pb-cle} my tree is coming down!

I've had this overgrown mulberry tree in my backyard that I've wanted
removed for years. Every year, sometimes more than once, the city comes
out and takes down the branches that grow into the power lines. After
years of this, the tree looks extremely shitty since it's got a big divet
in the middle. Meanwhile, the other half grows into my neighbor's garage
and they bitch at us to keep the thing trimmed, even though there's no way
we can get a ladder tall enough into their backyard to do it. Not to
mention this tree sends out new growth like a motherfucker and anything
anyone has ever done to trim it hasn't done much in the long run. A couple
years ago, a friend came out intending to take the whole thing down, but
couldn't because my other neighbor wasn't home and we were afraid of
dropping branches into his yard and onto his shrubs without warning or
permission.

Fast forward to this morning. Bright and early, we awake to the sound of
chainsaws while we're trying desperately to get some well-needed sleep
after a late night out. I was hungover and extremely pissed, so I tried to
sleep on the couch in another room for an hour -- but chainsaws are damn
loud and I'm a light sleeper. Grr. So I go back into my room and say to
Dave, "I wonder how hard I'd have to shake my tits in someone's face to
get them to take down the whole tree. Dave said, "Anything you do is worth
a shot." So I put on a teensy tiny tittie shirt and tight jeans sagged off
my ass. I strutted into the backyard and was like, in my sluttiest voice,
"Hey guys, " *wink wink* *tittie-shake*, "I really hate this tree. So do
my neighbors. Would it be at all possible, since you're already here, for
you to just take the whole thing down? the poor old man behind me is 80
years and he even tried one day to chop away at it, but none of us has the
right equipment..."

Long story shorter -- by 3:30 today they are more than happy for me to
sign a waiver giving my permission to have the tree taken down tomorrow. I
offered them lemonade, but the young dude staring at my chest said no
thanks, he had water. :D

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} R.O.M.07.13.06

That Ingenuity fest seems kinda interesting. I dont' think it was
around when I was in pgh before. Can anyone comment on whether it's
worth seeing or not? I guess I'm a little gun shy about the drive
after it cost $40 round trip to CDG (from pgh) in gas... (premium,
convertable w/ v8) so I'm thinking I dont wanna waste time on crap. I
checked out the website and it looks like a huge event, but after
looking at the videos and seeing how non-informative they were, and
how full of corporate fluff-nothingness, I'm a little leary... anyhow
with 3-6 hours of techno each night, by djs I really like, it should
be worth it by that alone... provided that the spot it's being played
at isnt really screwed up... Anyone have any thoughts to share? Anyone
know how long the sat and thurs sets are?

>
> Hailing from Houston, Texas, Henry Chow brings a fresh new sound to the
> international Techno community. Behind his calm facade, Chow - also
> using the .Stealth. moniker in local scene - was developing a technique
> that would create an outlet and make people feel that he had spoken his
> peace. The Chinese-American Henry Chow began his ventures into a DJ
> persona in late 1996. Initially, he was unable to categorize his
> efforts. However, this detriment proved to bless Chow with the
> background necessary to present his preferred style openly. Being
> influenced by the hip hop culture at an early age, Henry wanted new mix
> tapes to breakdance to so he found himself buying two turntables and a
> load of hip hop classics. After several trips to the local vinyl shops,
> Henry opened his mind to other forms of music and began experimenting
> with drum & bass, house and eventually techno.
>
> It was through techno that Chow felt he could move the crowd. "Techno
> has no boundaries. Being repetitive and minimal, It was no secret that
> techno was made for manipulation. It's all about manipulation;
> Manipulating the tracks and the crowd,. says Henry Chow. Debuting to
> Houston masses at a Lone Star Arena rave, the Stealth was no longer
> covert after a bangin. crafty set.
>
> By 1999 Henry Chow joined forces with Steve Sheffield and long time
> friends, Fernando Cortez and Thomas Cauley, and the four DJs created the
> Houston-based Tek-Xupport. The techno clique soon began taking over the
> airwaves on Friday nights on the local KTRU 91.7 FM .MK Ultra. program,
> which showcases local talent to the masses or those within range. It was
> within this earshot that Chow sought to expand. Ultimately, Tek-Xupport
> combined forces with Jeff Fleischmann and his 713Tekno project. In a
> colliding of minds, a true force to be reckoned with has emerged. Now a
> staple of the burgeoning Houston techno scene, Henry Chow, Tek-Xupport
> and 713Tekno create an innovative outlet needed to move techno up to the
> top more prominently.
>
> Shortly after, Chow and 713Tekno brought their sound to Hardrive.s Club
> Karma and established a monthly residence. Adjusting his, now, versatile
> style, Chow brought his offensive to a string of local underground
> warehouse parties, where the acoustics also hollered for techno to
> resound, and spilling techno throughout the surrounding blocks. With
> growing support, Chow was able to feed the techno masses as Static
> Wednesdays' techno resident at Houston's premiere nightclub Hyperia.
>
> Fully realizing the potential of his furtive movements and in furthering
> the Stealth moniker, he felt that there was a need to write and produce
> to keep the music fresh and alive in Houston. After about three years of
> writing and producing techno music, in late 2003, Chow signed on with
> Marco Carola and Corrado Izzo's Zenit imprint.  (c)Fahrenheit-media.com,

> The 3-Day Experience
> The 12th Annual World Electronic Music Festival or simply the .3-Day. as
> it.s become known over the years, is the 2006 installment of the largest
> and longest running event of its kind in Canada. With a rich variety of
> music, artists, performers and music lovers from around the world, it is
> an experience that is unique and enduring for all those who have made it
> part of their lives.
>
> It is the 3-Day Experience that we invite you to enjoy once more and
> potentially one last time. After searching across the province the WEMF
> collective has chosen a site that will allow it to create an event that
> is true to the roots of where WEMF came from and what it has become. A
> remote, forested campground, located on a crystal clear lakefront will
> bring all the music back outside where it belongs. Camping, dancing,
> enjoying the company of friends and everything else that the 3-Day
> Experience allows can only be enhanced by the presence of the sun and
> the stars!
>
> With this return to nature, we are also transforming the 3-Day
> Experience to a themed environment that will create a completely new
> level of connection and interaction with the music, the land and each
> other. In 2006 all stages will be themed. Travel through the experience
> by Air, Sea, Land and Space. Travel into your Mind and through Time into
> the future. We invite those new and old to join us for a completely
> fresh but quite likely final, 3-Day Experience!

>
> Artist Biography: Dustin Zahn
>
> After being influenced by mix-tapes of artists such as Richie Hawtin,
> Dustin began writing music purely for fun. Dustin met future-partner Ian
> Lehman, who was established in the mid-west rave scene. Ian explained to
> him that music similar to his was played at parties called raves. Ian
> invited him to one of his shows and Dustin took his offer to see what he
> was talking about. After being exposed to just one party, Dustin knew
> this was his future. He started doing Live PA.s at various local parties
> and quickly became a favorite. After a year Dustin stepped up to the
> decks and won just as much respect as he did with his productions.
>
>    In early 2001, Dustin and Ian both agreed to take things to the next
> level. They put a halt on bookings and concentrated on the studio. A
> year later their work had emerged onto vinyl and all over the internet,
> creating a serious buzz. Abiotic was born and the duo formed The Attack
> People.
>
> A few words can easily describe Dustin Zahn's style: moody, tribal,
> dark, and hypnotic. Since Dustin co-founded Abiotic Recordings with Ian
> Lehman in 2001, he's finished projects for labels such as Invasion,
> Mankind, Compound, GFR, Humanoid, and many other labels. His tracks have
> received support from techno DJs such as Adam Beyer, Ben Sims, Chris
> Liebing, Dave Clarke, Umek, Cari Lekebusch, Patrik Skoog, and countless
> more. Together with partner Ian Lehman they perform a Live PA under the
> moniker "The Attack People." A project concentrating on moody,
> futuristic funk for both the mind and dance floor. Zahn is also known
> for his diverse DJ sets which have brought him all over the U.S., to
> Europe, and South America.

i played on the midnight mixer stage last year, there was alot of 
interesting art in that building but i didn't wander much farther than 
that since i didn't have a full-access wristband which you need to get 
into some of the different buildings.

not sure how they're doing it this year, but i've noticed they're having 
more electronic music than last year (not by much tho)

maybe luke would know???

All I can say is whoa! What an amazing job Marisa, Stas,
and Roman did transforming the building into
a psychedelic wonderland! Stas did some amazing
string art and Marisa put together a dreamy
celestial industrial forest. The music is comming together
also. We finally got the sound together. Dj's will
be workin it all weekend. You will get a serious
dose of techno and psytrance/psyambient sets
The Goahead lineup is playing again on Saturday.
I will start with chillout set at 3pm. The psy-trance
frenzy begins at 6pm and goes until 1am. Sets
from Meghan, UZI, and myself and special guest Johnny.
We had a great time last night and the public seemed
to respond well to both the art and music.

Also, here are all timeslots for Friday to Sunday

Friday 7.14
Random(seed) 6-7
N:Coder 7-8
Jamie Tyler 8-9
GQEQ 9-10
Half Adder 10-11
Andy James 11-12

Goahead - Lineup
Saturday 7/15 - Timeslots subject to change
Malachi - Chill set 3pm -6pm
Psy-trance/Psyambient
Johnny - 6:00pm-8:00pm
UZI - 8:00pm-10:00pm
Malachi - 10:00pm-11:30pm
Meghan - 11:30pm-1:00am

Sunday 7.16
Random(seed) 6-7
Andy James 7-8
Scythian Project 8-9
1 Auxy 9-10:30
Open 10:30-12

This has been a great opportunity for us to
bring psychedelic and edm culture to the Cleveland area.
This festival is definitely something to build on
for the future.

> > Hailing from Houston, Texas, Henry Chow brings a fresh new sound to the
> > international Techno community. Behind his calm facade, Chow - also
> > using the .Stealth. moniker in local scene - was developing a technique
> > that would create an outlet and make people feel that he had spoken his
> > peace. The Chinese-American Henry Chow began his ventures into a DJ
> > persona in late 1996. Initially, he was unable to categorize his
> > efforts. However, this detriment proved to bless Chow with the
> > background necessary to present his preferred style openly. Being
> > influenced by the hip hop culture at an early age, Henry wanted new mix
> > tapes to breakdance to so he found himself buying two turntables and a
> > load of hip hop classics. After several trips to the local vinyl shops,
> > Henry opened his mind to other forms of music and began experimenting
> > with drum & bass, house and eventually techno.
> >
> > It was through techno that Chow felt he could move the crowd. "Techno
> > has no boundaries. Being repetitive and minimal, It was no secret that
> > techno was made for manipulation. It's all about manipulation;
> > Manipulating the tracks and the crowd,. says Henry Chow. Debuting to
> > Houston masses at a Lone Star Arena rave, the Stealth was no longer
> > covert after a bangin. crafty set.
> >
> > By 1999 Henry Chow joined forces with Steve Sheffield and long time
> > friends, Fernando Cortez and Thomas Cauley, and the four DJs created th=
e
> > Houston-based Tek-Xupport. The techno clique soon began taking over the
> > airwaves on Friday nights on the local KTRU 91.7 FM .MK Ultra. program,
> > which showcases local talent to the masses or those within range. It wa=
s
> > within this earshot that Chow sought to expand. Ultimately, Tek-Xupport
> > combined forces with Jeff Fleischmann and his 713Tekno project. In a
> > colliding of minds, a true force to be reckoned with has emerged. Now a
> > staple of the burgeoning Houston techno scene, Henry Chow, Tek-Xupport
> > and 713Tekno create an innovative outlet needed to move techno up to th=
e
> > top more prominently.
> >
> > Shortly after, Chow and 713Tekno brought their sound to Hardrive.s Club
> > Karma and established a monthly residence. Adjusting his, now, versatil=
e
> > style, Chow brought his offensive to a string of local underground
> > warehouse parties, where the acoustics also hollered for techno to
> > resound, and spilling techno throughout the surrounding blocks. With
> > growing support, Chow was able to feed the techno masses as Static
> > Wednesdays' techno resident at Houston's premiere nightclub Hyperia.
> >
> > Fully realizing the potential of his furtive movements and in furtherin=
g
> > the Stealth moniker, he felt that there was a need to write and produce
> > to keep the music fresh and alive in Houston. After about three years o=
f

> >
> > Artist Biography: Dustin Zahn
> >
> > After being influenced by mix-tapes of artists such as Richie Hawtin,
> > Dustin began writing music purely for fun. Dustin met future-partner Ia=
n
> > Lehman, who was established in the mid-west rave scene. Ian explained t=
o
> > him that music similar to his was played at parties called raves. Ian
> > invited him to one of his shows and Dustin took his offer to see what h=
e
> > was talking about. After being exposed to just one party, Dustin knew
> > this was his future. He started doing Live PA.s at various local partie=
s
> > and quickly became a favorite. After a year Dustin stepped up to the
> > decks and won just as much respect as he did with his productions.
> >
> >    In early 2001, Dustin and Ian both agreed to take things to the next
> > level. They put a halt on bookings and concentrated on the studio. A
> > year later their work had emerged onto vinyl and all over the internet,
> > creating a serious buzz. Abiotic was born and the duo formed The Attack
> > People.
> >
> > A few words can easily describe Dustin Zahn's style: moody, tribal,
> > dark, and hypnotic. Since Dustin co-founded Abiotic Recordings with Ian
> > Lehman in 2001, he's finished projects for labels such as Invasion,
> > Mankind, Compound, GFR, Humanoid, and many other labels. His tracks hav=
e
> > received support from techno DJs such as Adam Beyer, Ben Sims, Chris
> > Liebing, Dave Clarke, Umek, Cari Lekebusch, Patrik Skoog, and countless
> > more. Together with partner Ian Lehman they perform a Live PA under the
> > moniker "The Attack People." A project concentrating on moody,
> > futuristic funk for both the mind and dance floor. Zahn is also known
> > for his diverse DJ sets which have brought him all over the U.S., to
> > Europe, and South America.

  Car dealer employee gets prison for thefts

*Nearly $900,000 embezzled in 5 years *
Wednesday, July 12, 2006
Mike Tobin
**Plain Dealer Reporter**

A federal judge sentenced a Strongsville woman to three years in federal 
prison Tuesday for embezzling nearly $900,000 from two car dealerships 
where she worked.

Ruthanne Licursi, 55, admitted she used the money to keep her family's 
struggling bar business open and for gambling trips to Las Vegas and 
Detroit.

"Looking back, I know this obviously was not the right thing to do," 
Licursi told U.S. District Judge Lesley Brooks Wells.

Licursi started working as the office manager at Bob Morris KIA in 2001, 
after her husband suffered a stroke. She embezzled $310,000 over two 
years before going to work at Frank Nero Lincoln Mercury.

She embezzled $570,000 from that dealership from 2003 to 2005.

Licursi confessed to FBI and IRS officials before she was charged, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Blake said. She pleaded guilty this year 
to wire fraud and attempted income tax evasion.

Her brother and son owned the Bottom's Up bars in Lakewood and downtown. 
Licursi was the bookkeeper for the bars and used the money stolen from 
the dealerships to pay the bars' expenses.

Tom Ganley, who owns Frank Nero Lincoln Mercury in Bedford, passionately 
asked Wells to give Licursi a long prison sentence.

"While she tried to keep her family's business afloat, she nearly sunk 
mine," Ganley said. "She started stealing from me the second day on the 
job."

Wells ordered Licursi to pay $838,000 in restitution and back taxes. 
Wells chided Licursi for saying that she stole from the car dealerships 
in a moment of weakness.

"This wasn't a moment," Wells said. "This was years."

*7-19*



No special introductions.

No gimmicks.



*Dieselboy - (Human / Imprint - Platinum - Skippy Peanut Butter - Nueva 
York)* - The man who's alter ego is large enough to necessitate its own 
fucking Myspace page. You know him. You think he's the Barry Bonds of 
DnB. Okay, maybe that's him who thinks that.

Anyhow, come out. Show support. Pretend that you're a jock strap.



*The Prophet - (RSP Crew)* - Dieselboy heard he was going to be back in 
town, so we have Mr. Prophet to thank for this. Yeah, he's that fucking 
good.



*Cutups - (412DNB - Wrecked - Mt. Warshington)* - Rumor has it he's 
going to play an entire set of Billy Squire B Sides.

$5. All proceeds support Dieselboys penis enhancement surgery.

$2 Iron Drafts.

*FUZZ!* goes down every Wednesday at 10ish in the p.m. at the Bloomfield 
Bridge Tavern (4412 East Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh).

21+.

Subject: {pb-cle} Surpriiiiiiiise: DeezelNuts, The Prophet, Cutups - TONIGHT

7-19

No special introductions.
No gimmicks.

Dieselboy - (Human / Imprint - Platinum - Skippy Peanut Butter - Nueva 
York) - The man who's alter ego is large enough to necessitate its own 
fucking Myspace page. You know him. You think he's the Barry Bonds of 
DnB. Okay, maybe that's him who thinks that.

Anyhow, come out. Show support. Pretend that you're a jock strap.


The Prophet - (RSP Crew) - Dieselboy heard he was going to be back in 
town, so we have Mr. Prophet to thank for this. Yeah, he's that fucking 
good.


Cutups - (412DNB - Wrecked - Mt. Warshington) - Rumor has it he's going 
to play an entire set of Billy Squire B Sides.

$5. All proceeds support Dieselboys penis enhancement surgery.

$2 Iron Drafts.

FUZZ! goes down every Wednesday at 10ish in the p.m. at the Bloomfield 
Bridge Tavern (4412 East Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh).

21+.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

FRIDAY . SATURDAY . SUNDAY

The 3-Day Experience
The 12th Annual World Electronic Music Festival or simply the .3-Day. as
it.s become known over the years, is the 2006 installment of the largest
and longest running event of its kind in Canada. With a rich variety of
music, artists, performers and music lovers from around the world, it is
an experience that is unique and enduring for all those who have made it
part of their lives.

It is the 3-Day Experience that we invite you to enjoy once more and
potentially one last time. After searching across the province the WEMF
collective has chosen a site that will allow it to create an event that
is true to the roots of where WEMF came from and what it has become. A
remote, forested campground, located on a crystal clear lakefront will
bring all the music back outside where it belongs. Camping, dancing,
enjoying the company of friends and everything else that the 3-Day
Experience allows can only be enhanced by the presence of the sun and
the stars!

With this return to nature, we are also transforming the 3-Day
Experience to a themed environment that will create a completely new
level of connection and interaction with the music, the land and each
other. In 2006 all stages will be themed. Travel through the experience
by Air, Sea, Land and Space. Travel into your Mind and through Time into
the future. We invite those new and old to join us for a completely
fresh but quite likely final, 3-Day Experience!

WEMF2006 is presented by:
Destiny Productions

Fri Jul 28                          CHUNK                         Cleveland

With the electronic dance music scene back on the rise in Ohio, TRU & 
DISCO productions feel that it is about that time to bring the noise 
harder than we ever have in these parts with an enormous event that is 
sure to rock your shit for 12 straight hours and guarantee you will 
remember this night for the rest of your lives! Of course Michael Mellon 
of TRU Productions and the legendary Disco Donnie of DISCO Productions 
are known around the nation for producing massive headliner events that 
cater to thousands, but this event right here, .CHUNK. is on another 
level. We are taking it back to the old school this time. We are proud 
to be working on this event with both Koala-Tea and ANM Productions to 
bring you what is set to be a 2000+ person event. And, maybe, the most 
talked-about event set for 2006!

We have 3 rooms of straight TURBO SOUND, unlimited amounts of production 
including the sickest light, laser and visuals show that will 100% fuck 
your mind up and take you on a major euphoric journey. Not to mention, 
METROPOLIS NIGHTCLUB. This venue is legendary! Cleveland.s 
longest-lasting superclub which has just been re-vamped with a brand new 
hardwood dance floor, new carpet and furniture; the VIP area cannot get 
any nicer. Did I mention the massive TURBO SOUND RIG and the hundreds of 
moving lights and lasers in a 20,000 square foot venue?

Get ready people, here it is! We are proud to bring you an event of this 
status with 5 major headliners on the bill alongside the best local and 
regional talent in the nation! Set this date aside, you know you want 
to. Make sure you get your tickets while they are HOT! We are releasing 
a very limited amount at a very cheap price to hook ya.ll up. After 
those sell out the price goes up. Tickets will be available on-line at 
WWW.WANTICKETS.COM or at GRAND POO-BAS RECORD SHOPPE located in 
Lakewood, Ohio on Detroit Rd. up until 5pm the day of the event.

See you all at CHUNK! Getcha truffle shuffle on! -PEACE

DOMINIK EULBERG . TRAUM, COCOON (Cologne, Germany)
Without any doubt this guy is today.s hottest new commodity in the 
techno soundscape. DOMINIK EULBERG makes his first appearance in Detroit 
and will surely have in his crate those diamond hard beats and 
crystalline dancefloor shapes that he.s so well known for. Them 
Pitchfork folks can.t stop saying great things about him . we can

LA QUEST
La Quest is a band that recognizes its roots, yet comes completely
fresh by combining the respect for where they came from with a newness
and vitality unique to the Urban scene of their time. They combine
influences that range as far back in the past as 1950s Motown, Soul
and Blues, to present day Hip-Hop, R&B and Jazz, and to the future
with an original vision thats a synthesis of whats to come. The unique
sound that results was explained in a recent article in Columbus Other

Phatts McNatt (Live Drum & Bass / Breakbeat / Funk)

Read on from their MySpace profile:
A two man group that got this distinctive sound by conglomerating a vast 
amount of their influences into a funnel that is constantly evolving and 
digesting their musical hypotheses. They have taken different recipes 
from the Red hots, Fishbone and Primus. They have then taken aromatic 
and flavorfull spices from all around the world from the likes of Aierto 
Moreira, Ray Brown, Horacio Hernandez, Herbie Hancock, The Police, Bob 
Marley and the Wailers, Aphex Twin, Parliament, Bootsy Collins, Trilok 
Gurtu, DJ Shadow, Miles Davis, Freddy Hubbard, Eric Dolphy, Bjork, 
Living Colour, Paul chambers, Elvin Jones, Kenny Garret, Steve Gadd, 
Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Dre and Snoop, along with many, many others - 
construing them together ending up in a thick, chowder-like mass of 
groove oriented , wrongfully right, high octane sounds.

Artist Biography: Dustin Zahn

After being influenced by mix-tapes of artists such as Richie Hawtin, 
Dustin began writing music purely for fun. Dustin met future-partner Ian 
Lehman, who was established in the mid-west rave scene. Ian explained to 
him that music similar to his was played at parties called raves. Ian 
invited him to one of his shows and Dustin took his offer to see what he 
was talking about. After being exposed to just one party, Dustin knew 
this was his future. He started doing Live PA.s at various local parties 
and quickly became a favorite. After a year Dustin stepped up to the 
decks and won just as much respect as he did with his productions.

    In early 2001, Dustin and Ian both agreed to take things to the next 
level. They put a halt on bookings and concentrated on the studio. A 
year later their work had emerged onto vinyl and all over the internet, 
creating a serious buzz. Abiotic was born and the duo formed The Attack 
People.

A few words can easily describe Dustin Zahn's style: moody, tribal, 
dark, and hypnotic. Since Dustin co-founded Abiotic Recordings with Ian 
Lehman in 2001, he's finished projects for labels such as Invasion, 
Mankind, Compound, GFR, Humanoid, and many other labels. His tracks have 
received support from techno DJs such as Adam Beyer, Ben Sims, Chris 
Liebing, Dave Clarke, Umek, Cari Lekebusch, Patrik Skoog, and countless 
more. Together with partner Ian Lehman they perform a Live PA under the 
moniker "The Attack People." A project concentrating on moody, 
futuristic funk for both the mind and dance floor. Zahn is also known 
for his diverse DJ sets which have brought him all over the U.S., to 
Europe, and South America.

GoodvibesEnt. Proudly presents:
GOODVIBES!
Sunday, Sept. 3rd 2006
8:00pm-2:00am
18 to enter
21 to win! [and by win I mean get uber intoxicated]

Ive been noticing a bit of bad feelings in the scene lately so we at 
goodvibes decided that its time for another go, another reminder that 
the vibe is still here, that it doesnt have to be found in a warehouse 
or under a bridge. It can still be found right here. Its the people that 
make the vibe, not the venue. So I urge you, once again and feel the 
vibe. No drama, no hate, just old fashioned good vibes.

Sure now I see that.  Trout was trying to show it to me and we  
couldn't find it.  Saw plenty of the creepy metal port-o-potties.   
One had a padlock on it and a water hose coming from it... yeah...

Anyway, had a good time Chris Liberator / Dave the Drummer were  
great.  They played on the main stage until the shut it down around  
3:00am or so (yes, they shut down all the outside stages and some  
point every night).  they both went to renegade stage and played  
there till who knows when :)  few other good ones but they were the  
ones that stood out at the moment as I'm like half awake and at work.

I took some pictures, not sure how many though, don't think it was much.

yeah its still there
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/wemf2006/IMG_0513
looks like it's been since decorated a little....

all wemf pictures at
http://www.troutsoup.com/photos/wemf2006

friday get to the hotel like 7a, sleep like an hour and head to the 
party and wait for awhile in line outside trudeau park for like an hour 
(same venue as 2003).... fun fun....  stand around drinking in line only 
to find out thats a no-no until you're inside the park.  damn.  as usual 
charged 20$ for parking (not mentioned on the flyer as usual too)

we start scanning the CB channels and realize that there are alot of 
people with them!  get inside like 3-4 and setup.  slowly.  no fun there 
and then take a look at the timeslots.  4 of the 5 stages seem to run 
till 1-2 with the only one listed that runs all night being the 
goodfellaz stage which is indoors.  so now i see why they didn't 
announce any timeslots ahead of time.....  deceptive.  renegades were 
ordered by the police to shut down but started turning back on rather 
quietly at some point.  hung out at the gfz stage and ended up hanging 
around outside the building because it was a sauna inside.  ended up 
cashing in before the end of things and *gasp* sleeping.  people were 
still coming in at 5am.  no particular highlights really.  would have 
liked some of the sets on the goodfellaz stage if i could have standed 
to be in the building rather than outside....

got up saturday and went around with dan and adrienne to sell american 
duty free cigarettes and check out some of the renegade stages.  one 
renegade in particular seems to have a good lineup, and catch alot of 
stuff on it.  people still coming in and the park was pretty packed.  
finding camping space had to have been fun.  get really drunk and take a 
nap.  get up in time to miss jen mas on a renegade stage but things are 
looking promising.  mostly stuck to the gfz stage where alot of the 
usuals played, scott brown and neophyte killed it.  anne savage was 
really good, mark EG was pretty disappointing after the amazing set he 
played in feb.

heard someone say 12k people there.  crazy.

sunday morning hung around camp, went on some random missions and did 
the dreadful packing.  one of the people in our group wasn't with the 
program so milled around until everyone was ready to leave.  we all got 
a hotel room and got retarded for a few hours before leaving for home.  
(SNOWPLOW!)

well it definately went off better than 2003 when i last went, but still 
wasn't as good as 99-00.

Me too. WEMF camping was a blast. FF I predict will be just as much
fun... I wouldn't miss FF for the world. CDG camping sounds cool
too... so does the lodge thingy (not really camping if you're sleeping
in a bed right?)

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Fri Jul 28                          CHUNK                         Cleveland

With the electronic dance music scene back on the rise in Ohio, TRU & 
DISCO productions feel that it is about that time to bring the noise 
harder than we ever have in these parts with an enormous event that is 
sure to rock your shit for 12 straight hours and guarantee you will 
remember this night for the rest of your lives! Of course Michael Mellon 
of TRU Productions and the legendary Disco Donnie of DISCO Productions 
are known around the nation for producing massive headliner events that 
cater to thousands, but this event right here, .CHUNK. is on another 
level. We are taking it back to the old school this time. We are proud 
to be working on this event with both Koala-Tea and ANM Productions to 
bring you what is set to be a 2000+ person event. And, maybe, the most 
talked-about event set for 2006!

We have 3 rooms of straight TURBO SOUND, unlimited amounts of production 
including the sickest light, laser and visuals show that will 100% fuck 
your mind up and take you on a major euphoric journey. Not to mention, 
METROPOLIS NIGHTCLUB. This venue is legendary! Cleveland.s 
longest-lasting superclub which has just been re-vamped with a brand new 
hardwood dance floor, new carpet and furniture; the VIP area cannot get 
any nicer. Did I mention the massive TURBO SOUND RIG and the hundreds of 
moving lights and lasers in a 20,000 square foot venue?

Get ready people, here it is! We are proud to bring you an event of this 
status with 5 major headliners on the bill alongside the best local and 
regional talent in the nation! Set this date aside, you know you want 
to. Make sure you get your tickets while they are HOT! We are releasing 
a very limited amount at a very cheap price to hook ya.ll up. After 
those sell out the price goes up. Tickets will be available on-line at 
WWW.WANTICKETS.COM or at GRAND POO-BAS RECORD SHOPPE located in 
Lakewood, Ohio on Detroit Rd. up until 5pm the day of the event.

See you all at CHUNK! Getcha truffle shuffle on! -PEACE

DOMINIK EULBERG . TRAUM, COCOON (Cologne, Germany)
Without any doubt this guy is today.s hottest new commodity in the 
techno soundscape. DOMINIK EULBERG makes his first appearance in Detroit 
and will surely have in his crate those diamond hard beats and 
crystalline dancefloor shapes that he.s so well known for. Them 
Pitchfork folks can.t stop saying great things about him . we can 
guarantee to expect nothing less than floor-frying techno from this guy!

LA QUEST
La Quest is a band that recognizes its roots, yet comes completely
fresh by combining the respect for where they came from with a newness
and vitality unique to the Urban scene of their time. They combine
influences that range as far back in the past as 1950s Motown, Soul
and Blues, to present day Hip-Hop, R&B and Jazz, and to the future
with an original vision thats a synthesis of whats to come. The unique
sound that results was explained in a recent article in Columbus Other

Opening a night full of musical and artistic bliss:

Phatts McNatt (Live Drum & Bass / Breakbeat / Funk)

Read on from their MySpace profile:
A two man group that got this distinctive sound by conglomerating a vast 
amount of their influences into a funnel that is constantly evolving and 
digesting their musical hypotheses. They have taken different recipes 
from the Red hots, Fishbone and Primus. They have then taken aromatic 
and flavorfull spices from all around the world from the likes of Aierto 
Moreira, Ray Brown, Horacio Hernandez, Herbie Hancock, The Police, Bob 
Marley and the Wailers, Aphex Twin, Parliament, Bootsy Collins, Trilok 
Gurtu, DJ Shadow, Miles Davis, Freddy Hubbard, Eric Dolphy, Bjork, 
Living Colour, Paul chambers, Elvin Jones, Kenny Garret, Steve Gadd, 
Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Dre and Snoop, along with many, many others - 
construing them together ending up in a thick, chowder-like mass of 
groove oriented , wrongfully right, high octane sounds.

Artist Biography: Dustin Zahn

After being influenced by mix-tapes of artists such as Richie Hawtin, 
Dustin began writing music purely for fun. Dustin met future-partner Ian 
Lehman, who was established in the mid-west rave scene. Ian explained to 
him that music similar to his was played at parties called raves. Ian 
invited him to one of his shows and Dustin took his offer to see what he 
was talking about. After being exposed to just one party, Dustin knew 
this was his future. He started doing Live PA.s at various local parties 
and quickly became a favorite. After a year Dustin stepped up to the 
decks and won just as much respect as he did with his productions.

    In early 2001, Dustin and Ian both agreed to take things to the next 
level. They put a halt on bookings and concentrated on the studio. A 
year later their work had emerged onto vinyl and all over the internet, 
creating a serious buzz. Abiotic was born and the duo formed The Attack 
People.

A few words can easily describe Dustin Zahn's style: moody, tribal, 
dark, and hypnotic. Since Dustin co-founded Abiotic Recordings with Ian 
Lehman in 2001, he's finished projects for labels such as Invasion, 
Mankind, Compound, GFR, Humanoid, and many other labels. His tracks have 
received support from techno DJs such as Adam Beyer, Ben Sims, Chris 
Liebing, Dave Clarke, Umek, Cari Lekebusch, Patrik Skoog, and countless 
more. Together with partner Ian Lehman they perform a Live PA under the 
moniker "The Attack People." A project concentrating on moody, 
futuristic funk for both the mind and dance floor. Zahn is also known 
for his diverse DJ sets which have brought him all over the U.S., to 
Europe, and South America.

GOODVIBES!
Sunday, Sept. 3rd 2006
8:00pm-2:00am
18 to enter
21 to win! [and by win I mean get uber intoxicated]

Ive been noticing a bit of bad feelings in the scene lately so we at 
goodvibes decided that its time for another go, another reminder that 
the vibe is still here, that it doesnt have to be found in a warehouse 
or under a bridge. It can still be found right here. Its the people that 
make the vibe, not the venue. So I urge you, once again and feel the 
vibe. No drama, no hate, just old fashioned good vibes.

Big name DJ's all over the UK, and the United States.

With an appearance on Resist's Bonkers 15 album, non arguably the

Subject: {pb-cle} Frequency Fest - Roll Call, Kamp Krater Tent Circle

First off, Who's going to Frequency Fest?

Secondly, if anyone closely associated with the event could help me
with something, please read this post theres a request I have a few
paragraphs down.

Thirdly, I'm going all 3 days, and Trout and I and some PGH friends
are making a Tent Circle at FF, Nasty nate is bringing a 6kwatt
generator, A few of us are bringing blenders... I have a lantern and
stove. I wish someone had a stand alone ice maker? Anyone? Anyhow
there's gonna be a bunch of us there, a mix of PBCLE people and
friends of PBCLE people, alot of my younger pgh friends as well.

Basically this all started out from about a dozen of us that all
managed to find eachother at WEMF and actually got our tents next to
eachother. We partied hard and vowed to repeat at FF and have even
more fun. (I'm POSITIVE we will!) The name of Kamp Krater is derived
from what happened within a few hours of getting our tents set up at
wemf, and later at our hotel after we left wemf before we rode back.
Anyhow all PBCLErs that party and have an open mind are welcome to
join us... I'll be with my wife Adrienne in a beige with blue rainfly
tent that's 20'x10' and slightly triangular shaped. I shouldn't be far
from the Kamp Krater Flag. Please come say hi! (And introduce yourself
if we havn't met!)

BrandyMandyCandy is making a flag / banner that will say 'Kamp Krater'
and may or may not say PB/CLE as well. If you want to party hard, find
that and get kinda close but not too close cause all the inside spots
are prolly already taken by those of us planning this and carrying
over from our WEMF tent circle. maybe park your tent with enough room
to put another tent between you and the middle. If you're not looking
to party hard or want some peace and quiet, then look for our flag and
put your tent far far away from it.

Anyhow alot of us are buying $20 sets of 2-way radios so we can keep
in touch on the way to the party, and once you get there to find the
tent circle, and during the party to locate friends, and  etc... it
was tons of fun with these at WEMF and probably will be too at FF.
They have 10 mile range and are $20 for a set of 2, the ones we got
take AAA batteries although the package doesnt say... So go in with a
friend and they are 10 bucks each. We'll be on channel 21 subchannel
0.

You can find more info about the exact brand / model of radio most of
us have, and everything else about the tent circle at
http://groups.myspace.com/FrequencyFest that's a group for the Kamp
Krater tent circle.

Plz let me know if you wanna join our circle? so I can try and reserve
a big enough spot. maybe include how big ur tent is and if you're
bringing anything else that has to go outside of your tent that's
bigger than say 2 camping chairs.

I would love to get permission from someone associated with the event
to get in early and stake out our spot if possible? Id like to have
that staked out until like 11pm on friday and after that if the area's
not full remove the stakes and let everyone come who wants... either
that or as soon as the place starts getting full of tents, remove our
stakes. Does anyone know anyone affiliated with the event that might
have the capability of granting this small request? We'd just like to
be as far away from the stages as possible in case we make too much
noise or want to do a little renegade stage. It would also be nice to
be kinda close to some trees... I'm not asking for prime location just
contiguous space. If thats not possible I totally understand, it's all
good :) I dunno how crowded it's going to get? I'm just raelly nervous
after wemf when basically every single plot of land that could
possible fit a tent or car had a tent or car on it. no one could tent
by eachother... With the sick ass lineup and very reasonable price for
FF I wouldnt be surprised to see it PACKED!

Does anyone know if we'll be able to drive our cars up to our tent and
drop stuff off or are we hauling it all by hand from our car to where
we want to pitch?

If anyone has the capability of making on site, a baloon that floats
so that we can tie our flag to it, and tether it down, and you plan on
getting there early, that would be awesome, get at me.

Anyhow, most of this is alot of dreaming... whatever happens Im gonna
have fun and hope ppl come introduce themselves to me... many of you
I've been to more than one party that you were at and I never
recognised you or were introduced (Jea leigh, boompsie, few others).
I'll look just like my myspace pic at
http://www.myspace.com/raver_dan_K so come up and say hi plz if you
see me there. I'm sure I'll be wearing the graphic equalizer LED shirt
at least one night. tough to miss me!

I'd love to see some old skool represent!


Dan K

I would be the person to grant you this request.  Let me think about it & I will get back to you.  I'm not so sure about the renegade stage in the camping area because I know that will be the only place where people could get a little quiet time(sound will still travel there).  I would feel kinda shitty telling people that they can't set up camp at a spot cause it is reserved for people who aren't even there yet.  But all is still possible.  I will get back to you shortly.  You guys sound prepared to have some fun!  Thanks for all the positive feedback on Freqency.  Much Love.
                                                                         Peace, Cathy

noise or want to do a little renegade stage. It would also be nice to
be kinda close to some trees... I'm not asking for prime location just
contiguous space. If thats not possible I totally understand, it's all
good :) I dunno how crowded it's going to get? I'm just raelly nervous
after wemf when basically every single plot of land that could
possible fit a tent or car had a tent or car on it. no one could tent
by eachother... With the sick ass lineup and very reasonable price for
FF I wouldnt be surprised to see it PACKED!

Does anyone know if we'll be able to drive our cars up to our tent and
drop stuff off or are we hauling it all by hand from our car to where
we want to pitch?

If anyone has the capability of making on site, a baloon that floats
so that we can tie our flag to it, and tether it down, and you plan on
getting there early, that would be awesome, get at me.

Anyhow, most of this is alot of dreaming... whatever happens Im gonna
have fun and hope ppl come introduce themselves to me... many of you
I've been to more than one party that you were at and I never
recognised you or were introduced (Jea leigh, boompsie, few others).
I'll look just like my myspace pic at
http://www.myspace.com/raver_dan_K so come up and say hi plz if you
see me there. I'm sure I'll be wearing the graphic equalizer LED shirt
at least one night. tough to miss me!

I'd love to see some old skool represent!

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Frequency Fest - Roll Call, Kamp Krater Tent Circle

Thanks for the reply :)

I guess I havnt figured out yet whether the sound is going 72 hrs
straight or what?

After the dissapointment of wemf shutting down all the stages at
midnight friday, that's the only thing that makes me even want to
think about bringing renegade stuff. There are so many pimp djs here
anyways. It much easier just to not have it though. I hate the damn
generator noise anyways.

Whatever happens its all good :) I think I'll be in front of line
anyhow :) I think I'll prolly know half the people there anyways so I
dont think It'll be possible to be isolated or anything. Heck if I did
wemf I can do this much better :) I'll prolly just bring a few tarps
to throw down for my ppl next to my tent and it'll be all good :)

One last question: Do you know if we'll be able to drive to our tent
spot, dump our junk then park or are we hauling it all on foot from
the parking lot to the camping spot? I just want to know how to pack
all my gear :)

I'm so psyched for this...

A customer asked me at work if we carried these. Before I said "no" I
checked our website and found this one:
http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?order_num=-1&SKU=13016895

It's $300! Damn. Are they all that expensive? I think I'd stick to buying
bags of ice.
