	First of all I'd just like to say a big "thank you" to rob for
throwing this event and going out of his way to make sure we could be a
part of it if we wanted too.  ANd it was a GREAT event.  The vibe was
excellent and the small space enhanced it even further, just a great
crowd, a great mix and a great atmosphere.  Thanks again Rob for one hell
of a memorable night.

there were quite a number of ppl from the list there, including myself.
brian, david, braden (or is it brandon?), his grrl heather, aaron(aleph808),
nichole along w/ stevie-t and amy, Lisa(bla....whatever that number is),
jbrick, and sum others that I don't remeber the names of yet.

All in all I have to say that this was fantastic.
Just the right amount of the right kind of crowd.
And keoki was spinnin like I never imagined possible for him.
mmmmmm.....real tight. perfect vibe.

I meant to leave very early, as I have to head out of town early
for work today, however I couldn't get myself to leave.
WOW
thanks for the notice casey
and thanks for the great time Rob.

Wish we had more of these go on.....
but then we wouldn't appriciate them as much.

when Keoki arrived I thought all of the hype about
him bein out of touch was true. It was definitely a scene.
but then he started to kick it.....created a flow.... and BAAAM!!
The whole floor was alive and moving the entire night.
even got to see nichole do sum stylee moves.
afterwards I hung out a bit and talked w/ the list members
that stayed on. (as well as brian and dave's  return appearance)
talked to keoki a bit and he was very d.t.e. about shit.
threw me off a lil.

N E wayz,
On a scale of whateva... it was "Da Bomb"

L8erz all,
D4Pvv3ZZ

Well first of all I would like to give a HUGE thanks to Rob for making last
night happen. I would also like to express that I am very grateful that you
have included the pb-cle list in on things!!

Review of last night:
I had alot of fun. I came away from this event last night feeling good, and
just basically happy that I went.  I would do it all over again. I MISSED
CASEY!! :-)

Keoki review: ( totally off subject here )
Well where do I start? I thought he had a pretty good set last night...HOWEVER
I do not think he lives up to "SuPErSTaR* Don't get me wrong, I danced my ass
of, hell I even fell one time I was dancing so hard, I mean he is really good,
BUT..............I know people that no one even knows about that are so fuckin
good, but thats my opinion and that's a whole nuthah thing, so I wont even go
there...but do you people realize that there is some CRAZY ass talent out
there that we don't even know about...do you people think of this? Who made
Keoki what he is today? WE DID....what ever happened to supporting " no
namers" (this is what I will call them) OUR FRIENDS totally supporting them
because I dunno...we liked them, we talked to them, .......this is how
everyone started....why are we at a stand still? Why cant we support shit

Something Pittsburgh kids might be interested in:

I was thinking about the legalities of renegades (as in gatherings on
public property, noise laws, and regulations on these things), so I took a
look @ the city of pittsburgh website, and found that they have the
pittsburgh city code on-line.

http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/clerk/html/pittsburgh_city_code.html

There's lots of interesting info in there (haven't read most of it yet),
but a couple passages I found that people might want to check out:

http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/clerk/html/sections_477.01_-_477.03.html

This one's about parks and park permit procedures in case you want to have
an afternoon (or latenight if you can get permission) jam.

http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/clerk/html/sections_601.01_-_601.18.html

This one tells about regulations on "Unnecessary Noise and Sound
Amplifying Devices".  I think the application of this is pretty obvious.

I'm sure there's lots of other useful info, but I'll leave that up to the
interested parties to check it out.

BTW: only 4 more days to X-DAY! Goooooooo BOB!

Gotta totally agree with that...I you didn't come out you missed a great
vibe...and you wouldn't even had any trouble getting in...although I guess
maybe it was better this way, I had room to dance this way!

Anyway I don't really know who the hell I met last night, but I was the tall
dude in the wifebeater and sometimes black short-sleeved button-down and I
was with the short  Rican girl in all black.

Casey, were you the girl sitting at the door providing our entertainment
when we were waiting to get in?

This is the last thing i will say on this whole thing.  This was certainly not
a dis on you rob.  and this was not a dis on the people who were really
excited for this to happen.  I guess when i read the original post, i thought
it was Keokis idea that he should get to pick his audience and whoever wasn't
cool enough was out of luck.  I mean do you get where i am coming from?  After
all i have seen and heard about him, it just made me ill to think that if i
went, and i didn't get in...  I can understand space limitations and if you
would have left it at "the space only fits 100 people" that would have been
fine.  Then people would have known to show up early and take their chances.
But when you said he gets to choose who comes in and who doesn't, that's what
got me hot.  I have seen Big name Dj's in Small places many times, and i know
that in order to get in, show up early.  So i am sorry if anyone thought i was
dissin on rob for throwing the event, that was not my intention.

Peace,
Jason

ones before that). 

For both the PHUNKTION and PHORM we will offer our best know how to provide
you with the highest quality of audio and visual pleasure. Both events will
feature a fairly elaborate production/decoration as well. The details of the
PHUNKTION decor will be released early next week.

I could see that, it has been fairly proven that redmeats especially lower 
your brain chemistry activity. Not by much, but a noticable difference. Its 
unfortunate that so many of us have been trained to eat meat from the 
start.  I wish I hadnt been but I dont have the time nor the energy to 
switch to vegan/vegetarian and it would inconvenience me too much also. 
 Which brings up an interesting point. Part of 'living simply' in my book 
is thinking as little as possible about what one deems as 'unimportant'. 
For me that is food, I dont think heavily on it. I try to be quasi 
carefull, if i have a choice on a menu between 'good and bad' then i choose 
good. But I dont choose nothing when i am hungry.  As for my beliefs.  I 
dont have any :) Well, thats what people say about me anyway.  I believe 
that my beliefs (as for us all) are interned inourselves deeply and need to 
be released.  As such I dont define my beliefs but answer every question 
'on the spot'. Or situations how i might react and so forth.  Its part of 
my system of living but essentially I believe that I will do no harm to 
myself or others and will prevail in the end.

One thing that I have learned in life tho is that there is good and evil 
throughout all. Good and evil are simply unity and chaos respecitvly.  And 
this could probably be proven philsophically if I actually set down to do 
it. But part of it is shown in the varios texts and scriptions of the past. 
 Descart showed that god is the free will and the ultimity unity. That god 
is part of all.  The devil/evil/lucifer/whatever you wish to call it is the 
oposite of god and the only oposite of unity is chaos.  The world is 
naturally heading towards chaos but strives to stay with unity. Even if you 
just look around us you can see this. People want unity. They want sameness 
they dont want change. Change has always been frowned upon but it has 
always succeeded in the end.  We setup rules and regulations for ourselves 
because they are 'good' we break these rules and we are 'bad'.  The 
interesting thing in this is i view myself as good. But by definition i am 
chaotic and hence by society am bad or evil.  This just shows more how much 
of our whole system of beliefs is based on point of view.  I believe there 
is no 'evil' as defined by the varios religeons but there is 'evil' as 
defined as chaos and in the end evil will triumph but along the way good 
will have its bursts of power and control.  From ashes to ashes, dust to 
dust, chaos to chaos.

But thats just me.  I also think this is why so many people view drugs and 
especially lsd as evil.  Lsd is chaos for the mind. It twists and contorts 
and changes. Makes even the most 'sane' person unpredictable. But there is 
another example. Sanity vsus insanity.  Sanity is defined as viewing the 
world properly whereas insane people do not.  By this definition I am 
insane because I do not view the world as everyone else does but view it as 
it truly is. (Or so i believe)

Welcome to my mind. :)

I just saw your note about the Krishnas and it seemed right.  I think by
"unassuming life" he is just saying that it would be just fine to live a 
life
that is simple and not worrying about all the things that he worried about. 
 I
believe he thought that you should live life simlply and not be on the 
bodily
platform because it allows you to think clearly and have a higher
consciousness.  I believe that Einstien refrained from eating meat for the 
very
same reason, maybe he thought it lowered his conscoiusness.
Let me know what you think.  What are your beliefs?
respectz,

Subject: If AOL were a City

If AOL were a City

- You'd live in a place where no two people had the same name, and all were
hot 17/f cheerleaders with a fetish.

- You'd only pay $19.95 a month to live there, but half the time you tried
to leave your house, the door would be stuck.

- Once you got outside, even if you were in a hurry, you'd be assaulted by
slimy little door-to-door sales creeps offering you great AOL 14.4 modems
for only $399.99

- The commute to work is just a double-click away, but every time you try
to leave your driveway, the flow of traffic knocks you back into your yard.

- 48 hours after moving in, your mailbox would be overflowing with special
offers, promotions and discounts from www.getsome.com

- The local post office would tell your mother you're not a known resident.

- The local post office won't forward your mail to you when you move.

- The administration would kick you out of town for cursing after one of
those brutal toe stubs.

- If you saw a crime and called 911, they'd reply a week later with a form
letter saying how you "really are important you are to us".

- The administration would tell your boss to either pay up, or move his
loser of a company somewhere else.

- Everyone on the street would have something to do with kiddy porn, and
this business would account for 75% of all city revenue.

- Every time you went to the mall, people would run up to you and violently
scream M/F??!!, AGE/SEX?!?! or g0t PH1SH d3wd?! While little kids
called your cell phone saying "Wanna hook up?"

- Those that didn't do that would call you and say " Hi, I'm j0e hax0r from
the town council. We had a database crash and lost your tax records. Please
give us your address and the key to your house or we will be forced to evict
you and your family."

- Every time you went shopping, you'd be kicked out of the store by a
bouncer screaming 'WE'RE SORRY, THIS STORE IS TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE"

- Whenever you traveled to other cities, people would see your license tag
and laugh behind your back.

- even your 3 year old son would know the intimate personal details of the
town security expert.

- You'd occasionally be sent home during your day by another bouncer
telling you that the city has performed an illegal operation, but that it's
really the Earth's fault.

- The local McDonalds sign would be realistically changed to "McHax0r Wuz
H3r3" and "Gr33tz 2 K}It0sawruz" almost daily. Police don't investigate,
but do show up with little scrubby tools, or just remove the sign
altogether.

- Half the kids in the daycare you use are thinly disguised fat, hairy,
drooling, diapered men holding sacks of candy.

- Your daughter would disappear to the No-Tell Motel every night, and you'd
foot the bill.

- Putting up controversial art in your home would result in the police
bashing in your door, throwing your ass on the floor, and kicking the crap
out of you while saying "Ya got two chances left, idiot!!"

- You'd send your kids to school for history, math and science, but they'd
wind up studying one-handed typing, and annoying acronyms.

- You'd not have any idea who your neighbors are, and most new arrivals
would move in at night, stuff everyone's mailbox with crap, and vacate
before sunup.

- The administration would secretly sell off chunks of their personal land
in the city, while buying up neighboring cities with imaginary funds.

- The administration would build a huge, state of the art park, and allow
the kids to play there free, then suddenly demanding money while ripping
down the swings and beating the carp out of kids currently playing there.

- Don't forget the AOL playground, which is locked so that the kiddies
can not get out "for safety reasons", and then hordes of perverts &
pedophiles are allowed in.

- The police would work for free out of some sort of "duty" to the city,
but would secretly only be doing it for the free food stamps.

- Upon waking every morning, a voice from above would shout "HEY! YOU DO
WANT
AN AOL VISA, DON'T YOU?" To which you say "no". The voice then replies
"OK, I'LL ASK YOU TOMORROW".

- A trip to the local library would find you a few ancient doom 2 patches,
commercial pix of Pamela Anderson Lee, and a viral copy of PkZip 2.04g

- Community events would be periodically interrupted because of the speaker
randomly flying out of the meeting hall and appearing several minutes later
with some stupid comment about a Punt Monster.

- Your neighbors would be called to leave on pilgrimages to a mystical land
called USENET, where they would bleat the virtues of your fair city.

- Somewhere in another city, David Cassel would be sitting with a telescope
trained on City Hall, smiling contentedly.

Working now on 1.5 hours of sleep, but after last nights gig I couldnt be
happier!

First of to you pouty-doubting thomasas the fashion police were no where
to be found :)  Shortly after Keoki and crew arrived the masses (hmm maybe
100 ppl or so) were let in.   The space was small be excellent and the
sound system bold, clear and hype!  Being the first time I have seen Keoki
I would def say the term superstar would apply.  He seemed very cool and
calm while mixing up a non-stop dance-a-thon of various styles/mixes
trancy to hip-hoppish. Major props to Rob who I met for the first time.

Sleep really is overated :)

ps  it was cool meeting all you faceless ohioan list attendees :)

Well we played steelcity last night . . . and I was happy with the
results.  There were a couple of minor fuck ups (I picked the needle
off the wrong record (oops) and two trains came damn near close to
smacking directly into each other), but all in all I'm happy as hell. 
We played from 10-11:30 and not too many people were really there
then, except for the large crew of people that we got to come . . .
but not too many random ppl to get down.  Everyone was real cool
there, and we got bracelet's so we could go in the bar :)

After us, K-Set went on, and his track selection was real good,
playing some rough two-step wobblers as well as off the wall mash-up
business.  His scratching was decent (he scratched over the build up
to "Wishing on a Star" . . . that was just ILL) and his mixing was
allright.

Then Sine came on . . . he tore it up.  Forreal, not like the last set
I heard him spin at all (not that the set wasn't sweet, but the style
was different).  It was some high quality ambient type jungle, with
crisp beats as well as some harder beats thrown in there.  I was
really happy . . . unfortunately I didn't have enough energy to really
get busy, but it was still rough.  He played a tough at the top remix
that was rough as hell (probably andy c).

well, that's it . . . thanx to everyone that helped us get this, was
there, or wanted to be there.

piece Aut,

absolut

PS-The power part of the subject refers to the fact that the crazy ass
storm yesterday blew down all sorts of power lines, leaving me with no
power for the last 24 hours.  We didn't get to practice really before
playing, and I haven't been able to use anything electrical!!!  I'm
typing on my laptop now, but the battery is running out.

well i'd also like to thank Rob for a KILLER evening. I think everyone (not
just the dj) created such a great vibe. The music was perfect, the dancing was
great and the small setting made it even better. It was nice to see some old
faces i've met from the list before (Steve, Braden, and Casey) and it was also
nice to meet some people from the list i had never met before. I went to have
a good time and dammit i achieved my goal. Once again thank you Rob!

idiot AOL user and proud of it!

I was there!  I was there from like 10 til about midnight or a little after. I
wasnt feeling too well, and I went solely to drop the list off, then to go
home, but I was so entertained by the people there already just hanging out,
that I stayed, plus I wanted to see Keoki's 'grand entrance' and start to his
set, which is what I saw!!  I had a great time while I was there, and I am
glad everyone had such a good time. I went home and slept like a rock...

ha ha... 

we actually brought that shit along, but the mixer wasn't wired for
tapes. the power was out for hours beforehand so we didn't even get to
do the updates to the track that we wanted to before playin it. we'll
try our hardest to start it off with some v.i.p. dubtape bizness @
life is but a dream :)

For "classic" techstep get Torque . . . if you like techstep and don't
have it, then you have a problem.  And what kind of breaks are you
looking for?  acid breaks, "funkydesertbreaks", slow breaks?

props also to rob, who provided a barrel full of free bottled water
for the keoki party...altho most of my drinks were of the alcoholic
variety most o the night...one o which i spilled in the corner, causing 
funky to fall on her ass, while she wuz dancin...man, i wish i had a 
picture of dat...speakin o which, i gotta get these pics developed 
from the party...anybody out there from columbus have access to a 
scanner?

....for such a small party there sure were alotta net heads there...
prolly one of the biggest net head pics i've taken for quite some time...
it was refreshing to see that a majority of the net ravers were still 
about the positivity and had not bought into the ole bitter jaded attitude 
that seems to be a re-occuring nightmare on the list...this positivity 
intertwined with the obviously played-up flagrant showman style of 
keoki brought an obvious vibe within the small venue...in many respects 
probably due to its spontaneity & exclusivity from only word of mouth
advertisement and the high percentage of old skoolahs present @ the 
event, the party was very reminiscent of one of the underground attik 
partys in akron back in the day...when it was all about the vibe...and all 
the drama from all the greed and all the jealousy of the competing dj's 
and promotors had not emerged... 

keoki's selections which obviously catered more toward the club crowd
were always dancer friendly...altho his flow was a bit questionable at 
times jumping from everything from house to funky beats to some up
lifting ambient grooves...but this may be because that he is such a 
diverse dj and has not chosen to typecast himself within the typical 
strictly detroit minimal techno or strictly dark jungle dj...he did have 
one rather obvious mistake in the middle of his set (a moment of curious 
dead air, which may have been a sound system problem)...but definitly a 
much more minimal count from the older keoki with all the drug problems
...this was definitly a more sober keoki that played tuesday night in 
cleveland...his change in philosophy despite the onslaught of still 
increasing rumors, was quite evident in his composure and in his mixing...

...a tremendous time was had by just about all that attended, and i was 
personally a bit shocked by how quickly time flew by that evening...and 
unfortunately due to an interview i had @ 10am this morning and a 2.5
hour drive back, we had to turn down an offer of breakfast at 'my friend's'
(the local diner) from a dancer we had met that night and an overnight 
at gill's...

If things go well ill have a sign in the car and at the site labeled 
FA4-PB-CLE. Shit im gunna go as far as describe what im wearing on the way 
out there ;)

Did we ever get a count on the whole tent circle thing? Think of a location 
or since the site's changed no one knows..

Speaking of, does anyone know if there is a grocerie store or similiar near 
by the location? It would be a lot easier for us to by food suplies once we 
are out there then to have to treck them from pgh, as it is we may have a 
real tight fit in the car.

hi.

i dont know nuthin...but it seems like 2am fri nite to the left of the
stage (on the left side if u can actually go around the stage like u could
at the other fa's; or the left front side of the stage if u cant go behind
it) is as good an arbitrary meeting spot as any other...and then i'd have
another one on saturday at like 8pm same spot for ppl who came late or
something..and it'll stil be light out so u can see one another.

*shrug*

:)

hossam

wondering if he's feeling antsy now b/c he's getting excited for the w/e or
if it's coz he's still hungover from scj last nite?

Jul 10-12               TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL                    Texas

[major far away, but really looks fun!!!!  WOo-HA! lots of camping for me
this summer!!!]

As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this great
cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and some
of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if you
will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and volunteers
will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any
profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us
in the morning! Bring a can good if you can.

Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
"Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and lots
of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as well.
Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through our 2
gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This
is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
tents, beach balls, kites...whatever.

QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said "So if you want a
touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a huge dollop of raveyness,
then this is the place to be. Just don't forget to pack the toilet paper
along with the tent. After all this is the great outdoors!"

  the sound throughout the night will have both balance and progression,
  so you can always choose between two styles, or experience a flow of
  sound (dub-dancehall-jungle-hardcore-techno-trance-house).  There will
  definitely be some music you don't hear at every rave - both slow and
  fast tempos - but it will all be good.

  we'll be providing lots of fun stuff in addition to the music & lights,
  including toy prizes, free fruit, face painting, as well as other drinks
  (not alcohol) candy and water ($1) will be for sale.

  parking at the venue is limited, so we advize carpooling with at least 3
  (more is better) people in your vehicle.  we'll also be setting up some
  kind of carpool or shuttle.  leave a message on our line or email us
  (pbsproductions@hotmail.com) if you're interested in this.

  one thing we want to let everyone know: this event is about nothing more
  than having a good time, and grooving to the music!  have phun, but
  be responsible.  this music and culture are special -  we don't want it
  commodified and sold as a product. please respect the space and
  don't tag. don't bring drugs, weapons or ill attitudes.
  thanks to all the folks who've helped us this far - you're great!

  If you have any questions or comments,
   email us: pbsproductions@hotmail.com,
  or leave a message on the infoline 412-734-8334

POWER OUTAGE!!!!

:)  x 10

the highlight of my summer, perhaps of my life, just b/c shit like this don't
happen any more, aka I didn't have power tues afternon ->  thurs, 12:10 am
I loved every minute of it
i knew power was a downer when I was chillin w/ da homies and havin a ball
when it came on...it was great when we all went nuts runnin thru the streets
of RS spinning in circles, waving our arms in the air, and yelling "LIGHT!!!",
but it sucked (for me anyways) when we went back to the crib we was chillin at
and started watching TV.  there was even good shit on TTV (stuff like this
happens when u have cable, which i don't) ,  but it just zapped all of our
function away :
we went from talikng, cutting up, etc. -> sitting w/out motion & staring
silently, almost mindlessly at a glowing box.  I felt a noticeable difference
of how fast my brain was working, and preffered it w/out tv

SO, I ASK YOU THIS:
if the city was to ban power for an entire night so everybody could see the
stars, would you be down?

this is one of those survey type things..give me a private Email & i'll spit
out the results when they exist (now, they stand at 5 of 5 would be Way down,
not including my considering writing a letter to the mayor type ass )

If power didn't go out, I woldn't have been able to experience semi-melted
klondike (BOMB!!!)

other power loss storiez?

fuck all else that be

bonjour, mes {pb-cle} amis...

can someone hook me up with some info about the house of styles nite @
metropol tonite? do they ACTUALLY card headz for the 18+ thing? only 6
months till i can get into clubs, vote, sell my plasma + sperm :),
join the navy, buy blunts and not get carded(!), participate in
medical studies for loot, and go into adult bookstores :)...

um - so anyways... djs? price? etc... infoline would be nice for
further refrence. i thought it was a bit strange that there was no
info at all on the h_o_s infoline.

...frankie g

ps - did i forget any 18 year old activities?

So is there a pb-cle tent circle organized?  I remember talking to people
about it at sub-phunc 27 (sorry, I have been in DC since then so I have
missed most of the list).  Some people were talking about bringing a
renegade sound system.  Does anyone know if open flames are allowed?  Like
can we cook food over fires or have camp stoves?  It would suck to just
have to eat granola bars and cold dinty moore the whole time.  Anyway I
hope I can find some kids from the list.

Alright kidz, I am only gonna check my mail *one* more time tonight before
heading out to the event (FA4, duh), so I am hoping someone replies to this
before 11:00 tonight *cross fingers*....anyways, I am gonna be scoping out the
place for any and all signs relating to this net meet thing, hopefully they
will be visible somewhere. Also, is someone gonna post something at the
message center or whatever? 

Hey, I thought it might be helpful to send my picture along with this post
(that is what the download is)...if you care, you can look, if not, then don't
;) Maybe someone can find me based on that...

I *really* hope this pans out, and I get to meet some fresh new faces, I am so
ready for this party I can hardly wait ;) See you all there, or hopefully,
hear from someone before 11 tonight!

small event (Location) like dat :)

Toronto on Sat, check me out at that Phryl event :)

To everyone who came out for Keoki on Tuesday.
THANK YOU.
Not only from myself, but also from the "superstar" DJ Keoki.
He says it was the most fun he's had this year, and I can say the same. 
Now,
For those of you that aren't going down to Family Affair until Saturday, I'd
like to remind you that on Friday we are hosting GARTH from the Wicked crew
out of SanFrancisco.  The show is at Trilogy, 2325 Elm St. in Cleveland.
Doors open at 10:00.  Hope to see a few of you there, as Garth is one of the
best in the country.
Ticket price will be low...7 or 8 bucks, so you'll still have enough pennies
to get through the rest of what promises to be a very long weekend.
Again, My thanks,
Rob

Might I also recommend for everyone both hand sanitizer and also 
something like Stridex pads -- for a quick wash of hands and face while 
you're on the go?  I've heard that there are indeed showers, but you 
never can have too clean a face and hands.  (It might not be all that 
convenient to use the showers anyway)

:-)

Just picked up an innocent lil' flyer reading:

S.C.R.I.S.
steel city raver information system
....etc...

www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Lounge/8690/techno.htm

I checked out the page...its pretty similar to the rom & technology -
but i got to give props to anyone who takes the time to do all that html
editing. :) anyone know the person behind this?  (Are you on this list?)

Anyway...just a piece of info.

It's $2 for under 21 and $3 for over.  It's a collaborative effort on the
part of 4 or so people.  That's probably why it's not on the HOS line.
Tonite is 7-Up, Product 19, BeeDee and I think Zemo.

Is that price maybe backwards? (Otherwise, I better get out my "I'm 18"
fake id.)  Anyway, I'll be there later on. :)   Downlow: Thanks for
offering to flyer for us before - I'll bring a bunch of flyers tonight.

You may not be too happy if it rains.  Even if it only pours for an hour 
or so, snuggling up in those wet blankets later won't be very pleasant.

tent but people are welcome to use whatevers left for, well whatever. ;) 
 Maybe you could wrap yourself in one or two. Or if we can pull it off we 
will just make one huge mofo tent for anybody to use..

Hey, I wish I wouldn't wait until the last minute! Just wanted to drop
ya'll a note to say the High-R Frequencies magazine crew WILL be at
Family Affair. I'll have a few of the last remaining copies of the
Spring issue. We couldn't quite bust out the summer one in time for FA,
so it will get some major coverage in the Summer issue! 

Good Dancers Wanted!!! --- I will be on the lookout for good dancers to
feature with an article about dancing in our next issue. If you know any
good dancers, or are one, look for me. You can recognize me by the
flashing red lights on my green Ninja Turtles backpack. I am short,
slender and have short blond hair. 

We are hauling our butts out from Kansas City. A couple of us are
Geriatrics and one a sista DJ, so we'll prolly be hanging out at
Geri/Sista sound system off and on. Don't miss High-R's own Erica
(Witchita) droppin the records there! 

I will try to make the PB-Cleve and Midwest netmeets. If you see a
backpack on the ground, I am most likely dancing or talking in the very
near vicinity, so please come say "Hi!" I like to meet new ppl. 

High-R's Andrew Arnold from the Midwest list will also be running around
with us. 

Drive safe and spread the love -- all weekend long!

A while back I wanted to conduct a survey to find out more about people's
night life habits.  A club owner suggested that I try it on the web.   So
here it is:

http://www.cyberdrive.net/~tweaked

It is not intended to be something that fills your mailbox with useless
information.  In fact, you don't even have to give your email address.  I
will *NOT* be selling the email addresses to anyone, or giving it out to
those who spam.  It is simply a survey being taken to find out exactly what
the habits of club goers are like.  The reason I posted this to pb-cle is
because I know many of you go to clubs on a regular basis.  I understand
many of the questions are not directly related to the underground scene, and
it is not my intention to integrate the mainstream and the underground --
though maybe that is what you would like to see happen.  Either way, its a
forum for you to voice your opinion.  I realize its rather long, so I
greatly appreciate your time.  I have had it up for about 4 days and have
already recieved a large response.

So if you want to say something, please do and I appreciate it.  If not..
then disregard.   But please, no controvesy :)

well guys, i went to that thing at SPEAK IN TOUNGUES (sorry about the
misnaming) and i was very very disappointed.  there were two guys and i think
one of them was named 606 or something.  ah, basically, i was expecting some
phatty d&b-maybe some experimental stuff or even some gabber (shudder, but i
can put up with it.  :D ) but it was really not anything i can even explain
that well.  it was really random, loud, and made my friend's headache worse.
i think this might explain it.  they were mixing cd's and i think maybe a
record but i'm not sure.  whoever was palying with the cd's took one of the
cd's, grated it against his teeth and then scraped it on the table and then
put it in the player.  it was awful.  however, i really liked the space and
was thinking that it would be a phat spot for an after hours or a little teeny
party.  it was a strange experience but the good thing was that i got to bond
with george (SenecaOH).  he's a cook kid!!!!  Let's all hope that he makes it
out this weekend!  LOVE YOU GEORGE!  have a good fourth kids!!!!
love,
  sharon

no, i'm not talking about the psychoactive, damnit.

i'm talking about that new program that sonic foundry just put out. it's
supposed to 'revolutionize' composing using loops.

anybody use it? i'm thinking about buying it, but i wanna get some
opinions first. if it sucks, i'm not shelling out the $300 they're asking.
no way in the nine hels i'll give them $300 for something that sucks
rocks. ;P

I've been looking into "Acid" too!   It's suppose to be an EXTREMELY easy
program as well as a clean one.  The designers behind it wanted the "dance"
scene to especially like it....so ....they threw in a bunch of options that
most DJ's/Producers would use.  

If you decide to purchase it let me know.....we can "swap"

I've got Cakewalk 6.0, Cubase VST 3.5, Cool Edit Pro v1.1 A ton of Rebirth
tools (RB338 and TechnoBox)  Electronic Workbench 5.1, Mixman Studio, Wav
Surgen 2.0, Sound Forge 4.0, Roland Virtual Sound Canvas.....along with many
other:-)   

(I've been doing this stuff for a few years, and I've built up a nice
collection:-)  

Let me know how things go:)

damn,it verges on unanimous, in favor of no light!  this makes me happy...a
few wish to watch tv, use computer, or at least be warned ahead of time.  my
favorite response:

I'd be down for sure.  I don't think Duquesne power would want to do it
though ($$$).  I'd be down for some sab-o-tage though. mwuhahaha!

I always wish our society was more together and random so that we'd do
stuff like this.  That's why I worship the movies in the park/art in the
park type stuff...its the only effort the city makes towards doin'
something worthwhile @ bringin' folks together.  There's this vague,
general conservatism about life that society as a whole has (personally I
think as individuals most people hate this), which dictates what should be
going on 'most of the time'.  

For instance: our city thinks its all cool and okey-dokey to borrow
something like $800 million to build two sports areanas (when we have one
that works fine as it is)....but they wouldn't even spend 800 dollars to
hire a dozen clowns to walk around downtown, hand out candy and make
balloon monkeys for everyone.  We try to throw *free* or out of our pocket
fun-creativ' type shindigs for kids (renedades) on public property.  You'd
think as a society we'd support that kid of stuff...everyone else is
tryin' to make a buck or zombiefy people, but no, that's not the case.
Its looked @ in some respect as criminal.

Here's the lowdown on Family Affair.  Rich has already been there for 30
hours or so and it's hotter than hot and no shade in sight.  It's a wide
open area so bring sunscreen and as little clothing as possible.  Plan
on doing a lot of walking too.  There are 4 stages and they're spread
far apart.  Hills to walk too. It's 7:50 Fri. night and he estimated
that 2,500 people are there now.  The camping area is filling up.
Good luck and good camping!

     have left town in favor of bigger and
     better things. not much traffic about
     this... did anyone go to the one in
     cleveland?

In a message dated 98-07-04 12:48:53 EDT, you write:

<< i heard from the pb-cle list you got a big old electronic music program
collection.  I have always wanted at least one and as of yet don't got shit.
I might be getting my own computer soon (thisis my dad's) , possibly used b/c
it would only be $400.  but i must know, how good of a computer is needed to
run these programs?  if limitations w/ slower computers,, what are they (if
you can, just give me the general scoo >>

Well......the faster the computer, the faster the programs run.  Whenever you
use a program geared towards music or art, it uses up alot of your processor
speed.  I have a 200 Mhz processor in my computer and programs work pretty
good.  Top of the line is a 400 or 450 Mhz processor!   Another thing that you
should consider is the amount of RAM in you computer.....again, thats another
speed thing.  RAM is like you computers "traffic light"       

If you have alot of RAM......the commands that your computer will process will
be faster than a small amount of RAM.    Picture a traffic light changing
colors every 2 seconds....thats alot of RAM.......Now picture the light
changing every 10 minutes.....

When you're working with music on a computer.....the faster the better.
You'll be using effects and samples.....if you have a slow computer, FORGET
about time stretching!!!!!!!!!!    It would take you FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!    

If you need any other help....just ask.

Yes, everyone was raving far too hard to write an email.

Perhaps i'll take this chance to write the first "review".

The music was foul for the most part-- very few of the djs showed up.
It was crack den.

I fucking loved it.

Family Affair, hence, the name... go with some good friends, meet a few 
more and *pinG!* there you have it... Pitch a tent! Explore the hills!  
Oh, the places you'll go!  It was my first FA party, and despite the 
dramatic lineup changes, soundsystems being shut down, ambulances 
(ergh), etc., i actually managed to have a jolly good time.

AND NOW FOR THE SHOUT OUTS:
yo yo peace to the headz reprazentin from the boss-town: ch33ken, 
lindsey and mr. p. hinchey, from brooklyn, miss courtney powell, and 
from jersey city, bill 'fatlip' grant.  nuff respect to the mc sphinx 
for sorting us out with your vip holiness and to my new cleveland cats; 
kate, gil and brandt-- much love.  and then there was dan.  michael-- 
where are you?  OH YES, we raved hard.

LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, the gratituitous inside jokes:

"what the fuck happened to that bag of food?"
"oh gosh... well, yeah."
"it's not that i enjoy staying up all night, it's just that the only 
music i like happens to be played then."
grapes and ice
"ok, first i want to tell you the story of my pants."
spot the crackhead
"every year, on the last day of family affair, i sit on this stage, look 
at the crowd and go 'what the fuck am i doing?  when is this going to 
end?'"
"she's not fit, but she's really cute"
"look at how i maintain--- believe"
door of the plymouth
"dude! they were throwing bags of spit and firecrackers at your car!"
"the stars are back out"
"die ravers--- we hate all toys"
"we'll never submit to the authorities and their evil doings!  this is

It was pure chaos. Or as either jeff or brendon put it. A complete 
autonomous zone.  No police, no control. A full frontal drug swapmeet.  You 
name it and it was bought, sold, traded, stolen, given.  Well not much on 
the stolen that I am aware of. IMHO the music kicked ass. Especially friday 
night into saturday morning. This is by far the best vibe at a party ive 
ever seen.   Never seen such enthusiasm for dance circles. People happlily 
smiling and watching other people dance.  Cheering each other on, cracking 
jokes and takeing it well.  The rain bumbed a lot of people in the morning 
saturday but by evening it was back to full swing.  I missed most of 
saturday evening into sunday due to a personal issue but I heard it was a 
blast.  Next year im gunna plan a shitload better.

     Well, I may just be the only person who made it to both.  So, I guess that
allows me to do a comparison.  Hmmmmm?  There is none.
     I arrived at FA at 8am Sat. and left for Philly by 11.  Our golf cart was
the only reason I actually thought about staying for but the charm ran out in an
hour or two.  So, off to Bang2 I went, leaving Rich behind with the
Downlowmobile.
     Bang2 was incredible.  When I pulled up my heart sank when I saw at least
3,000 people outside of Shampoo.  I thought for sure it was going to be another
crowded disaster for Local 13.  I made my way to the guest list to find that the
Local boys had received my voice mail that morning and left 2 comps for me at the
door (this courtesy isn't extended on such short notice in many cities). I was
one of the first ones in the door and was immediately handed a line-up sheet with
the time slots for the 4 room party.  A tent was set up in the parking lot
outside where Feelgood, Josh Wink, Terry Mullen, Scott Henry, Dan and surprise
guest Frankie Bones would play.  I spent most of the night outside which was
incredible.  The inside was air conditioned and stayed cool for the first few
hours or so and then became a bit stuffy.  The outside stayed surprisingly not
over crowded.  Just enough people to be comfortable.
     After April Foolz I would definitely say that Local 13 did everything in
their power to make Bang2 a complete success.  This party was honestly the most
organized event I've been to in 4 years. I didn't hear one negative comment the
entire time I was there.  Smiles a plenty.  Dj Supa Mouse was a smash hit with
her 80's jams in the bathroom lounge.  Throughout the night everyone made their
way in to dance to a Prince tune or two.  Fun stuff.  All of us geriatric kids
showed our age based on the excited looks on our faces when she played the
anthems of our pubescence.
     Downlow will be hosting a bus trip to Philly for their next Whistle event,
which promises to compare to this weekend.  Mad props to the guys from Philly.
Thanks for an incredible weekend!

Yeah.....What you heard is true.

     What happened from what I understand is that my some of my friends were
walking around at around 2am(I was at the tent), and saw him spinning around
in circles apparently on drugs of somekind(their best guess was that he was on
E), and he was completely wigged out.  But sometime afterwards around 3:00a or
so, he sat down in the middle of a field.  I guess he died sometime soon
afterwards because when they found him at 11:30-noon the next day(saturday),
he was already stiff.  For those of you who didn't go, there were A LOT of bad
drugs going around, suppossedly some of the E(Certs) was smack, and some of
it(Black Licorice) was pure PCP.  I know for a fact that some of the certs
weren't good, because in the middle of my roll I got a really smacky feeling,
as did one of my friends who got so bad he puked.  I know drugs in general
aren't the greatest, or smartest things in the world to do, and that you take
a chance when you pop a pill in your mouth, but at events like FA, it's
possibly the worst time to try to scam and/or mess people up.  As soon as you
get there a good vibe is the first thing you feel, and if drugs are your
thing, then you're going to want to enhance the entire experience by taking
them. I think it's pretty shitty that someone would take advantage of this try
to ruin everything by selling people bad stuff.  Personally I'm surprised that
a lot of other people didn't suffer the same fate as that one guy(I feel
really bad I don't know his name).  Well that's my little schpiel(sp?) on
that.
    Other than that, the party had a great vibe, even though a lot of DJ's
didn't show, it rained, and the stages were kinda far apart, I still had a
great time sitting and dancing around, chilling with friends and meeting new
people(not just ravers, but all different types of people from all over).  I
give mad props to the UPS crew for giving A LOT of people an opportunity to
see what the rave community is(and should be) all about.
                                                                          Duck

Well, in response to Kelly's comparison of Family Affair and Bang 2, here is
my comparison of Family Affair (that i went to on friday night as well as had
many friends there all day saturday and saturday night) and Sector 616 in
Kalamazoo Michigan on saturday night.  

 Comparison: 
Both had outdoor venues.. i guess that's it.  LOTS of people at both.  i think
family affair had around 7000? and sector 616 seemed to have around 3000.

 Contrast: 
Family Affair - absolute chaos.  while i was there, i saw jordan spin on a
small stage (highlight of the night for me), lemon lyman, some live hip hop
act, trevor (the instigator) - spin some VERY good mellow/intelligent techno,
and i saw mark verbos set up but left before he started cuz i was too tired.
 from what i gathered, very few acts even showed up. all of my friends that
stayed there either missed damon wild, oliver chestler, adam marshall, kenny
glasgow, and heather heart, or they weren't there.

Sector 616 - other than the 1 hour 45 minute wait in line (during which time
we got out LOTS of flyers), this party was one of the smoothest organized
parties with the best talent i have seen in a long while.  as soon as i got in
the door, the surgeon took the stage (he only DJed, i thought he was playing
live).  during this time, i passed out flyers at the door, so i didn't watch
him spin, but i could hear, and he delivered an EXCELLENT set of dark,
downward style techno.  next up was a live act called bios, whom i hadn't
heard until then.  they played for about an hour, then, came jeff mills..
people were completely flipping out; yelling and screaming for the first 5
minutes of his set, and continued to cheer every time he spun one of his own
tracks.  since i had been up for roughly 40 some hours, i decided to leave
after he was done, so i unfortunately missed claude young.  for most of the
night, there were 2 rooms of techno, and an ambient stage.  that was the first
time that i can remember ever being at a party with 2 rooms of techno only..
hopefully, it won't be the last.  i'm not even going to go into detail, but i
would like to say that i think alot of people from this list missed out on a
pretty unreal event musically.  i only saw about 8 people from ohio/pa that i
knew at the party, and only 1 of these people was an "average raver", the rest
being musicians or promoters...  

i realize that alot of people look forward to family affair being the big
social event that it is, but i don't really understand how it is that so many
people from a culture supposedly based on music can opt for whatever reason to
go to family affair when some of music's greatest producers/djs are spinning
just 4 hours away. (not to say that family affair didn't advertise very good
acts, it just seemed as if they weren't there.)


oh well,
Lou

yo. 

amp was/is tight tonight. I mean, 808:state, I haven't ever seen amp play
them. Now all they need to do is play some orb, or some old-ass moby, and
I'll be a happy little guy. 

Speaking of happiness, when are there going to be some fair priced raves
around here (cleveland)

In a message dated 98-07-06 08:09:30 EDT, you write:

<< uhh....heLLO!!??  Certainly you realize exactly how illegal your proposed
 "swap" is and how stupid it is to post that to a public list...one that is
 archived on a publicly-accessable webserver no less!  Talking about things
 that are illegal that just the government is going to hunt you down for is
 one thing, but publicly, blatantly offering to steal from a technology based
 company who would likely find and read this message is a lot less smart.
 Please use your head, crap like this could realistically get your butt in a
 hot spot and/or get this list shut down.  I'm not making any judgement calls
 here as to what is right or wrong, you can decide that for yourse >>

First off....your last sentance is your best:-)   To make judgement upon my
"swap"....well....thats a bit harsh.  I do not steal ANY programs!!!!!!  I
have bought every piece of software that I own.  I've been making music for
over 6 years!!!!  The Acid program is one thing that I haven't gotten yet, and
someone on the list has it, if he wants to trade for it...cool...if not
then...it's no big deal:)   I can see how illegal it is, and to make such a
proposal in public is stupid,  BUT!   It only goes for the individual who
needs it:)   

I know that the average "rave" musician doesn't have TONS O' CASH to throw
around when it comes to most things let alone computer things:)   I've been
there....I've broke that is:)   Friends of mine use to give me things, just so
that I could get up and running.  And from there, I bought the full versions
of the program.  The last thing I bought was Cakewalk 7.0.      

If my offer to help someone out has offended you then I do apologize:-(    I
just thought that I was giving someone a break....

Now I know how generous I should be.....especially on this list:-)  

But PLEASE!!!!!  before YOU PUBLICLY ACCUSE SOMEONE OF STEALING....get your
facts straight and know the details.

For the same reasons they can all crowd into a room where Rabbit In The Moon is
playing while a handful of people listen to RICHIE HAWTIN in the next room (Fri,
nite). Definitely perplexing.

Oh well is right.

well. i didn't have as much fun this year as i did last year, but i still
had a blast.  For those of you who saw the sign " NET RAVERS MEET HERE",
that was mine and spikes tent.  saw a few of yinz but not as many as i was
hoping to. The hills were absolutly deadly.  i'm sore in places that i
didn't know i could be sore from walkin' 'round. but...... the coolest
thing was that one of out neighbors came all the way from Taiwan to come to
family affair.  I thought that was kick ass!! i'm sure i'll write more
after i fully recover....pooh'd the fuck out...

 one thing, but publicly, blatantly offering to steal from a technology 
based
 company who would likely find and read this message is a lot less smart.

[David Schwanke]
Yup, thats what IRC is for. :)))
The proper way to do such things in a public forum is "Does anybody have 
XXX I could BORROW?"
Then take it to private email.

However, and I dont want a flame war because of this, but as amanda is on 
chemicals I am on certain software traffic.
The chances of any bigname company tracking you down and arresting you are 
miniscule to practically nothing.
Its going to cost them more money then the program is actually worth to 
find you and sue you.
They would have to get a warrent to search your home or personal 
belongings.
Email, list or otherwise, is not yet at the point of being considered hard 
evidence.  Primarily because it is too easy to forge and too hard to trace 
properly.
The big name companies really do not give two shits about individual piracy 
issues.  The same way that music companies do not crack down on all of the 
bootleg trading that goes on.  Everytime you make a copy of a tape for a 
friend you are pirating music.
If they are going to go after anything they are going to go after major 
distribution points (sites). Or large organzied sets of individuals 
(groups).  They occasionally go after individuals that make money off of 
the piracy (such as rusty&eddies) but that is because if you are making 
money then most likely you have money that can be taken.

Small companies will occasionally attempt to go after small time people. 
Usually not directly but by reporting you to the proper athorities and 
maybe throw in a few other illegal activities to make it worth the cops 
time.

The one company that is so far an exception to the rule on big companies 
going after small fries is NetWare.  They have been directly invovled in 
multiple narqs and takedowns of varios warez sites and boards and such 
their software is nolonger pirated by the major piracy groups. The major 
narq of one of RiSC's boards a few years ago is the prime example. 
 Microsoft and ibm were involved but in name only, they threw some money at 
the govt to get things rolling but netware was directly involved and taking 
an active stance against it.

If big companies are going to go after anything they are going to go after 
the source of the problem, not some small timers like college or highschool 
students.  They are going to go after their own employees because they are 
the ones that leak the beta's and code that helps crack the higher ticket 
items. They are going to go after the software store employees that take 
'returned' software home and release it and bring it back the next day.

In the end the best solution is to do it privately, and securely. 
 Encrypted if possible.
Granted publicly saying it is a bad idea.  The feds are most likely not 
going to come running because of it.

Maybe because they're waiting for the phenomenal line-up coming to

[Totally and completely off topic]

Do you know how something out of the blue will suddenly come to you when
you're pre-occupied with something else?  Well, this just happened to me
and I wanted to share it.

Okay, what I want to know is this (and please don't now view me as an
idiot for mentioning this):

In the song, "Wannabe" by the Spice Girls, there's a line that goes,
"blah, blah, blah ... She's a real lady.  She doesn't come for free."  The
singer is referring to Posh Spice and is supposed to be suggesting that a
fellow who wants to take Posh out will have to take her to nice
restaurants and treat her well because she's accustomed to "fine" living.

"She's a real lady.  She doesn't come for free."  Well, what it sounds
like to me now is that Posh is some kind of prostitute.

Well, speaking for myself, it was because Sector 616 was really just a
normal party (even if the music was provided by some of the best in the
world) versus FA, where everything -- the music, the 3-day length, the
huge numbers of out-of-towners, being outdoors, the incredible diversity
of music, and the reunion with all your friends from all over the
country -- combine to make an experience that is so much MORE than a
regular party. The "social event" aspect of FA is only one, actually
very small, part of its appeal. 3-days and 2 nights of great music,
gettin back to basics through sleep deprivation, no showers, sleeping
under the stars (or in your cars), and the chance to commune with nature
and thousands of total strangers can not even be compared to going to a
regular party. 

The music is always great at FA, too. FA shows that you don't have to be
Jeff Mills to play an insanely great set, and you don't have to hear The
Surgeon to hear one of the best sets of your life. I actually enjoy the
mix of "The greats" and the relative unknowns at FA. In fact, every
year, some of the best sets are played by up-and-comers. 

I will admit that FA this year was blatantly NOT what it advertised.
Other years have been disorganized, but this was worse. Some of the
headliners showed up, only to not get to spin (Did anyone notice whether
R. Notorius J got to spin? He DID show up, but I never saw him on the
main stage where I was. What a shame!) Plenty of headliners apparently
did not even show up. However, because FA is not just about the music, I
am still very glad I went.

hmmm...well what to say....

it was my first family affair, so when i got there i was severly hiped, and
trying to ignore the fact that i knew there were probably much better parties
going on...but that was where i was, so..well damnit, that was were i
stayed....
....everything started off good, i saw lots of familiar faces all through
friday evening, and i was greatly anticipating the main stage to start pumping
out great music......but i talked to the sound man, and he said, they didn't
have any idea who was spinning, when they were spinning... basically no one
knew what the hell was going on...  i talked to the 'unknown' kid spinning at
the time, and he said he had been paid $100 to use his tables because no one
was there who had any for them to use!  that got me a little worried....

...well on through the evening, i made a horrible mistake and bought some
'stuff' to compliment my evening, and it turned out to be very very very bad,
and i ended up missing almost everythign friday night.......i heard the
beginning of one set, but no one knew who it was...i was loving it before i
had to leave.....

.....saterday i spent recovering from my bad night, and friday i was ready to
groove all night....i played it smart and ended up having a great night,
though once again, it seemed no one ever knew who was spinning....plus when
the main stage was grooving, all the other smaller stages were shut down,
making the expected choices of the evening disappear......well anyway it all
was abrubtly ended at 6:30 am when it was announced everythign was being shut
down!   well....i didnt' end up leaving till at least 4pm, but all hte music
stages (that had been re-opened) were shut down one-by-one while me and my
friends tried desperatly to continue dancing...oh well....all and all not a
complete waste but definatly not what i expected for my only family affair

I got there about 24hrs. later than I expected due to having a
fantastic Thurs. night up in Toledo partying w/ Lisa.
By the time we made the trip down... stopped and picked up
supplies and pulled into Alpine Hills it was after 6pm. and the
prime camping spots looked already filled up. So on we went
down over the hill to pitch tent on the left side of road next
to the pond. kind of a quite spot, which was kewl when we
needed to get away and take a break. only about 5 other
tents pitched near ours and they were all Pitts. kids. Didn't
seem to us that they were much of the rava type and they
kinda kept to themselves alot. weirdness. But hey, takes all
kinds to have a party, right?
Anywayz, after the setup we headed up the hill and started to
look for other netheadz / familiar faces..... Well at least on
Fri. night we found a few familiar faces, but not many netheadz.
Watched Dink play a set on the mainstage, visited the other
stages for a while (not knowing who was spinnin' due to no playlist)
and finally went back down to the tent @ 2am w/ the intention to
just get a break and maybe eat. Instead we crashed hard until
7:30 the next morning. From the talk of things, I guess we missed
some fantastic shit. YMMV.
G.ma lives only about 5min. away from the event in Dover, so we
headed over there for a good shower and visit for a bit.
Back to the party @ noon. Ran into more of the Akron crew.
(Rory, Joe Kidd, Chris Rock, etc.) and found out that
they were all spinnin at the stage directly above the pond
all afternoon. So we spent most of the day there hangin w/ them.
A few times we checked the mainstage, but it sounded a bit
out of our style during the day.
The stage directly on top of the hill in front of the main had the best
damn shit of the whole party though. Not to mention all of the
breakers that were dancin and showin tricks. This was my fav.
part of the whole event. A verrrryy gooood vibe here.
finally started meeting some of the geeklist at this point.
Erik, Amanda, brandon, steviet, spike, andy the pooh, greta,
and a few others that I met for the first time. Props to all of ya.!
It was gettin late and I needed food and Lisa wanted to rest,
so back down the hill to the campsite we go. Lisa decides
to stay and I head back up into the rumble to finish the trip.
Watched J.T. be a total asshole to some of the local Kent / Akron
crew and hear that he was the same w/ lots of ppl that made
the event go as well as it did despite him. Brian should have
had a better handle on things. Oh well, it's over now.
finally ending my trip w/ that dude from Astralwerks throwin'
mad basswaves through my body until 6:30 am when it was
all shutdown hard. BIG BUMMER.
Hung out w/ Robin Urmanic at the stage and talked to the the
guys from eyegasm and w/ John (H.O.S.). My head was
finally clearing up a bit and it was time to go back to the
tent and take a power nap before headin out.

All in all a decent time, despite not being what was promoted.
And despite rumors.......NO ONE DIED!!!!!!
2 o.d.'s - one kid 18, the other 20... both recovered ok.

hhrrrrmmmm....damn, that was a bit long winded, eh? hehehe
L8erz folks,
Steve / Dapwezz

I know one of the promoters and I'd like to be able to say that I
feel that this was something that was pulled off with the best of
intentions.  But to be honest, if I wasn't truthful in what I'm
going to say I also feel that I'm doing a disservice to those same
intentions.  So if this sounds negative; so be it.  I don't hate
anyone, really, I don't.  :)

It sucked.

Not so much for what it wasn't, but for what it could have been, or
perhaps wanted to be.  This was a tremendous lineup.  A lot of
people came out for it.  But due to a combination of a poor space,
lack of production values and cooperative weather, it turned out
being something that fell far below my expectations.

Long, dark backwoods highway roads that were labeled after letters
of the alphabet led to a dirt-filled construction site that was the
venue.  Cars were parked in a rough, uneven field just outside the
site.  Reminded me of Sickness and Recovery.  As you walked 'round a
20-foot mound of dirt you were presented with the first of the
evening's dissapointments... the line.

We arrived at 12:30am after a four hour drive.  We didn't get to the
gate until nearly two.  During the hour and half wait, we heard the
Surgeon play, and thinking it was Mills, got pretty discouraged and
cranky.  It was fun yelling at all the people trying to cut in
front, only to be caught by the seemingly overzealous hired security
who escorted some back to the end, but it would have been more fun
to have actually been _in_ the party.

A discussion with one of the security led to him saying, "I don't
think they realized what they were in for."  I didn't see many (if
any) "crew" once inside that caused me to believe differently.

I simply don't understand why there wasn't a better setup for
processing people.  With the money dropped on the talent for the
event, you are basically paying for the numbers that are going to
show up.  You HAVE to expect these sort of situations.  There wasn't
enough personnel to handle it.

Two people searching.  One on guest list, one taking money.  I'm
sorry, but with an hour and a half line of people waiting to get in,
what the fuck.  The search was of the simplest I've seen, a quick
look in a bag or a quick look-over of your person (no pat-down).  We
could have snuck an Uzi in there.

After finally getting in and realizing that we hadn't missed Mills,
our spirits were lifted for a bit as we walked around a bit and
checked things out.  Two, wall-less tents were setup in close
proximity to one-another.  The "main" housed the amps, bins and
video crew alongside an outer long wall of the tent, with the sound
facing outward towards the main area of the site.

The second sound system (same-sized as the main) was located inside,
facing as you'd expect. It was lined up against a short wall and
broadcasting along its length.  The third "ambient" system was a
ghetto setup of a few speakers and tables placed outside between the
two tents, aimed directly at the front gate a few dozen meters
ahead.

The main "stage" was outside the main tent, where the tables, a
projection screen, and two technobeams were located.  In _front_ of
the main sound system.  I had heard that some of the performers were
complaining about the monitor; personally I could understand how
this sort of setup would make things quite difficult for them
regardless.  Was the sound originally going to be placed inside the
tent, but then they changed their minds and moved everything outside
so that more people could see Mills?

While Jeff played it would occasionally flash "JEFF MILLS" on the
screen behind him, so maybe that question was answered already.

The port-o-lets were in a similarly questionable position as they
were at the last Black Nation event I attended, "People's
Revolution", where they were almost within arm's reach of the 2nd
sound system.  This time, there were plenty of them but lined up in
a row that began only a few steps from the front gate.  There was a
lot of space at this site; people are more willing to walk a little
way to go to the bathroom then they are willing to put up with that
smell.

Lighting consisted of a few technobeams mounted on top of a car (as
Joe already pointed out) and some strobes.  I don't recall any
intelligent lighting in the second tent or anywhere else. 
Programming was, as Joe pointed out, weak.  The technobeams are
bright as hell but as far as I'm concerned they could have used that
money on a laser or two and projected the beams against the mounds
of light-brown earth around the site.  It would have been far more
effective.  With the limited amount of fog produced by the single
generator (on the ground next to the car the lights were mounted
above) in an open area, the equipment they had seemed wasted.  

The ground varied between fresh-tilled dirt to hard-pack sand, which
led to an interesting mixture of hard and mush as you moved from
area to area.  Ruts and weird angles, combined with unmarked tent
stakes, ropes and cabling led to an interesting environment.  If it
would have rained, it would have been a mess; the third sound system
wouldn't have been able to have been operated at all.

Not a single trash bag or can was located anywhere I or any of my
friends could see.  In the morning there were flyers and garbage
everywhere.

Hmm.

What looked originally to be a location out in the styx turned out
not to be, as there was a trailer park and several private
residences tucked in the woods around us.  Noise complaints resulted
in the sound being turned down on the main system to disgustingly
low levels; unfortunately right as Mills started.  You could stand
in the corner of the main tent and hold a normal conversation with
someone.  It actually turned out being louder in the tent _behind_
the sound than it was in front; since there were less people to
absorb the sound... it seemed that's where people were having the
better time, too.

Sound in the 2nd tent was much louder but extremely muddy to the
point of being undancable for me after a few minutes.  It was like
listening to your home stereo with your speakers stuck under a load
of laundry.  Well, your home stereo would have been louder.

After all this, I'd like to say that the music made up for it,
but... I can't.  I missed the Surgeon BECAUSE I WAS IN LINE FOR AN
HOUR AND A HALF and was so turned off by the things I've listed in
the preceeding paragraphs that I really wanted to just forget it all
and go in a corner somewhere and dance to some good music.  I mean,
that's why I came here, right?  That's why I'm out here in the
freezing cold?  That's why I keep going to these things?

Not to be.

Jeff's set was dissapointing.  I don't know whether it was of the
way that things were set up that he was having problems getting
things to sound right, or he would (understandably) just be in a
pissy mood because of the way things were run and simply wasn't
trying that hard, or maybe he was having a bad night.  The sound was
so low that the only people really dancing were behind him, pressed
up against the wall of speakers.  The ones he could see were those
standing in front of him, far away from the sound, with their hands
in their pockets.  It wasn't anything great.  

This is the second time I've seen him.  His style is undeniable...
but I'm more of a dancer, not a DJ.  He follows sounds rather than
grooves; in a similar vein to Dave Clarke or Claude Young, his cuts
and tricks destroy the flow but maintain the rhythm.  As for just
playing some kick-ass tracks, his speed of transition between
different sounds only gives you a taste of each... but his track
selection at Sickness & Recovery seemed much more varied.

So in a sense, you go to a smorgasbord and you get to eat a lot of
delicious morsels but it's all mixed together on one big plate that
you're forced to eat quickly.  You're made to appreciate the
mixture, not the individual units.  A unique and quite dynamic sound
is created.  For the ability to do that alone, I give him major
credit.  But he was off on several occasions; with three turntables
going and a drum machine, it's pretty obvious if everything he's
trying to syncopate doesn't line up exactly.  Or returning to my
food analogy, the beats become bland.

Played a lot of the same tracks that I've heard him play at Sickness
and Recovery and on the Liquid Room CD.  If this is a case of giving
the audience what they expect, then I suppose that's what the
promoters are paying for, but for the amount of money that I suspect
he was getting paid, I don't feel he lived up to it.  Hype and
product in this instance didn't live up to each other.

The cheering for his mistakes led into a discussion I had later at
breakfast.  Some people are so into the hype of a DJ or producer
that it clouds their judgement.  Or in many instances, completely
replaces it.  I'm not suggesting that Jeff Mills isn't a great
producer or even a great DJ, but I'm convinced that he could produce
a record of pure white noise and people would gobble it up and label
it brilliant.

It was a trainwreck.  Plain and simple.  But ^^** JEFF MILLS **^^
did it so _obviously_ it was something that he intended.  Man, that
was the FUCKING BOMB, YO.  What does this say about the people
cheering?  That they were so fucked up on drugs that they couldn't
tell the difference, or that they were so fucked up on superstardom
and idol worship that there is no difference?

Shit like that stinks worse than the port-o-lets.  It's what keeps
bullshit egos, elitism, politics and money flowing.  More people
need to get their heads out of their asses and realize that the
thing that keeps any of this real is the appreciation, not
consumption, of the music and the talent that creates it.  As I
pointed out in a previous message to this list on Friday; it's only
"real" if you dig something for what it _is_, not for what it's
supposed to be.

But that type of seemingly misguided worship is a cloud that hovers
over a lot of things.  Anyway...

Caught parts of Claude Young's set and things sounded even more off.
This gives more credence to the bad monitor/setup theory, but
whatever.  The booty hip-hop in the 2nd tent while Mills was on was
interesting but not something I was into.  Whoever was playing the
sunrise house set while Claude was on the main system had a lot of
mistakes and liked to use the cutoffs on the mixer a lot; people
would cheer and clap for this for some reason I was trying to figure
out but eventually gave up on.

At six in the morning security was still demanding $25 if you wanted
to go out to your car and come back in.  No comment needed.

[sigh]

It's sad, really.  I wanted this to be a good party.  I honestly
did.  The lineup was great, it was outdoors, it wasn't that far
away, I appreciate and like the people throwing it.  But it was a
shoddy production that simply wasn't worthy of the talent that was
being presented... and more importantly, marketed.  I give Black
Nation a lot of credit/balls for assembling the lineup; too bad it
wasn't used properly, because aside from the problems, more events
with a similar high-talent/low-frills approach need to be presented
(and attended) in the midwest.

Still... lots of bouncing happy people; lots of pissed off ones too.
Saw a some friends that I haven't seen in a while and although I
wound up having a good time, it was clearly a case of being in spite
of the promoters' efforts and not because of them.  And in so much
as I understand where the $25 ticket price went, I don't feel it was
being returned upon in terms of value or concern for the people in
attendance. 

If this is the vision that we are trying to promote, maybe we need
to get a new prescription for our glasses.

> What looked originally to be a location out in the styx turned out

Thanks for ruining our plan.  Recently, a group of friends and I had set
up a system of surveiling various mailinglists and newsgroups.  I am in
charge of monitoring this one.  I was suprised to come home and find
that the computer had reported an active reference to the
artists/musical group "styx".  I cannot relay how happy our team was
when we initially opened the letter -- such quality (and quantity!). 
Only, to find that you are not speaking of the artist "styx".  Thanks
for wasting our time and resources.

Sorry your such a waste of human space that you feel the need to
flame an individual and/or group for use of slang or misspelling
words. Do the words mailbomb or portfuck have any meaning
to you? howz about a nice lil voltage spike instruction to the
CPU hidden in a message attachment? Get my drift?
Blow off you meaningless fuck.
L8erz on Styx,

hi.

i dont really know where to begin...to quote charles dickens

'it was the best of times, it was the worst of times'

i find myself telling ppl about this event and i always end up saying..."i
know it sounded like it sucked, but i had a good time"

this was the first party in a long time that i can remember feeling 'boy i
wish it wasnt over' when it was over...

oh yeah no doubt the shit was out of control...

too scattered, too widespread, too disorganised.

the main stage setup was potentially brilliant...all the ingredients were
there...but it was like putting together 2 eggs, some flour, oil, and water
in a bowl and expecting a cake to make itself. (i thought of that reference
before your sector616 post craig ;P)

i had a fucking blast. i got to hang with a large (10-15) group of friends
both old and new and be silly and laff and hang out and "stuff".

i would love to see a well organised 10,000 person world class event be
thrown at that venue next summer. there is no reason why it couldnt happen.

suggestions: install a tow rope/skateboard mechanism to get ppl up and down
the hills...chair lifts...nooo - too many potential jumpers.

it's sad but true that i go to parties to enjoy myself and that's it
anymore. pure recreation, like a movie or amusement park. the sad casualty
of this is that i have become very jaded and indifferent when i see wack
shit going on. 

re: drugs...yes, when a person takes ONE hit of e and isnt educated to know
that you have to keep drinking water or you may dehydrate and that person
dies, that's unfortunate...but when someone takes multiple hits of multiple
drugs...self responsibility needs to be thrown into the mix...you cant
claim 'i didnt know taking x amount of this and y amount of that would fuck
me up' -- bullshit.

ok some substance:

lion's JUNGLE (not drum n bass ;) set on fri nite was wicked. respect.

who else...i know dink/dank whoever...SUCKED.

lemonlyman gets props for trying to blow shit up on fri nite, but if i
recall correctly you used the 'in the beginning...' intro to build the crowd
up, and right when it was about to drop you threw over to a techno
record..and instead of blowing up, everyone thought...'thats not right' (i
understand what you were trying to do but i think had you at least let the
first few measures drop into what they were expecting, they would have
followed you longer thru your set).

drc i recall being allright...the music programming was a joke if anything
it contributed to the uneveness of the entire event. fast/slow/back again
NO NO NO.

sat nite was a bit better...

we all unanimously decided to park our asses at the main stage and deal
with it rather than trudge back and forth for nothing...

so we set up camp on the right side of the stage (on stage) and we all had
a blast :)

crap rap/reggae from 12-2:30...im sorry but unless im at a de la show i
dont want to hear 98 bpm at 2am.

i forget who went on before rebel crew (was it atomic babies? or did they
go on after rebel crew)...my review of rebel crew (with assistance from
miss kate ;) - we say: "they sucked less this year than last year" 

later on was roy davis jr. the saving grace of the nite...not that his set
was by and far the best music i've ever heard, but it stood up over the
mediocre, uninspired tunes i had heard to that point...finally good
house...we were all up on stage dancing...gill thank you SO MUCH for taking
a picture of me and you know who dancing...i'm gonna frame it :) (and hey i
smoked you up too, dont forget...being second doesnt suck all the time :)

then k. alexi came on and played more detroit-y house...then jay goodwill
came on (i have never been too big a fan of goodwill's house...awesome guy,
excellent dj, just cant move to his sets)...then astral matrix (not
affiliated with astralwerks) from san fran came on...it was at this point
that gill said 'its not like that i like to stay up all nite, its just that
all the music i like to hear isnt played til the end' :)

then the shit got shut down and the group came to the quickest decision of
the entire weekend....'buh-bye' we took off, no goodbyes no nothing we were
GONE :)

there were some ppl who i was hoping to run into that i never did (you know
who you are-we'll catch up next time)...but given the size and scale of the
party (i estimate 7k ppl? seemed def. more than last year) its
understandable.

random things:

big up the knights inn. big up the WICKED match b/w germany and
croatia...**3-nil??* crazy...dan. you're a fucked up motherfucker. and
remember, they'll always be watching you...just be glad you didnt get us
arrested. respect goes out to the boston van...glad you made it back safe.
gill-18 holes, a case of beer and scorecard...count on it. kate...sorry i
kept apologising for acting stupid on sat nite when apparently (according
to all sources), i really wasnt :) ian. yes mate :) colby...wicked finally
getting a chance to really hang out and introduce you to my friends. and no
worry, i always try to use my super vip powers to help the less fortunate.
;) (yes, all three of these cars are with me :)

shouts go out to: all the wicked jungle dj's i didnt hear. :P to jonb for
being GHOST all of friday nite and then hanging for a minute on
saturday...michael and mariah...mariah youre a sweetie :) michael..thanks
for the sat am wake up mate...and stock up on some sunblock geezah...;)
much love...the whole cru: ian/timestretch, lindsey, and peteh from boston,
courtney and bill grant from the greater nyc area, kolbi_kjnuton and
((dan)), myself of course, gate and kill, i mean kate and gill, and their
friend brant and the dover police department. thanks for not arresting us.


hey. here's a crazy idea. go to phunktion. won't be quite the same as
family affair, but thank god there's only one family affair a year :) no
seriously...*mumble mumble* something something maybe somebody special
secret surprise guest?

ignore me.

email me if you have any questions re: phunktion and i'll get you the 411.

peace,
hossam

Saw this while meandering on the web.  A film called "Modulations."  The promo 
write-up follows, reprinted w/o permission.  I apologize in advance for the 
formatting problem:

(begin)
>From the makers of Synthetic Pleasures, comes the film Modulations, a 
feature-length
     documentary which captures a moment in history where humans and machines are 
fusing
                        to create today's most exciting sounds.

     Modulations traces the evolution of electronic music as one of the most 
profound artistic
   developments of the 20th century. By cutting back and forth between avant garde 
composers,
    Kraftwerk's innovative synthesizer drones, Giorgio Moroder's glacial 
Euro-disco, Afrika
    Bambaataa's electro-funk and Prodigy's current worldwide superstarstardom, 
Modulations
     celebrates, replicates and illuminates the nomadic drift of the post-human 
techno sound.

  The film examines the kids who have turned the turntable into a musical 
instrument, disillusioned
   disco lovers who created acid house out of primitive synthesizers, Motor City 
mavericks who
    saw the drum machine as their escape route out of urban neglect, and a 
generation of British
   youth who transformed these blips and bleeps into dancefloor anthems of their 
own alienation.


            Modulations provides a sense of history and context in which today's

              electronic music can be understood. It entertains the converted and

                     remixes the mindset of electronica's nay-sayers.


    Featuring a stunning collage of interviews, cutting-edge visuals, in-studio 
footage and live
  performances, Modulations moves at a pace that matches the energy and innovation 
of the music.

this is a public flame ot everyone who cant take a minute to decide if
something is a joke or not.


it's time to fucking sort yourselves out. not only is your reply

ok...think we had this discussion like 6months ago..but I heard this track
on 89.3 in cleveland today.  I THINK it's called "oye como va"...it has
the Al Pacino quote in it...

"You want bigtime!? I'll give you fucking bigtime!!"

Or something like that...then HARD bassline...I need this track.  Can
anyone give me a title/artist/label/anything!? I'd GREATLY appreciate it!
Giving me a webpage or someplace where I could order it would throw me
into ecstatic fits on the floor ;)

HEY BORGAS

Thanks for ruining my plan.   Recently, a group of relatives and I set up a
system to track down other people from the Borgas clan.   Wow, were we excited
to get your letter only to be totally disappointed at such an obvious
mistake... noone from our group is so intolerant, hateful, or egocentric.
Thanks for wasting my time with your letter.  

P.S.   I hated styx...even in the 80's.

 artists/musical group "styx".  I cannot relay how happy our team was
 when we initially opened the letter -- such quality (and quantity!). 
 Only, to find that you are not speaking of the artist "styx".  Thanks
 for wasting our time and resources.

<< last weekend i went to something called "the vinyl communications tour" ...
even tho i suspected that it wouldn't be an all-night event, i didn't get
there til around one.  so i only caught a little bit of the last band, but it
was a surprisingly interesting experience.  unlike anything i've ever
witnessed before.  (in a good way.)
 
 the act i caught was called "operation reinformation."  it was three
 local computer geeks playing on their laptops.  actually, one kid used a
 commodore 64 - joystick only - for the last song.  anyways, the music they
 made consisted
 entirely of bleeps and tweaks.  first one kid would go "beep beep beep
 beep" then another would join in so it sounded like "beep bobit beep bobit
 beep bobit beep bobit."  so it sounded somewhat like 80's new wave from
 england.  unlike live pa's, their software did not loop the samples and
 all together, so they had to synchronize it manually.  very cool.  the
 band has this nerdy image down to a tee - thick glasses and all.  they had
 computer keyboards strapped around themselves with neckstraps like
 guitars.  it was straight out of that movie _revenge of the nerds_.

last night i stumbled upon a totally new genre of live music.  i
accidentally-on-purpose went to a show really late, catching only the last
fifteen minutes of a 6-hour show called "the vinyl communications tour" or
some shiznit like that.  i think this group of artists is gonna be at the
knitting factory later this summer, you should definitely check them out.

the act i caught was called "operation reinformation."  it was three
local computer geeks playing on their laptops.  actually, one kid used a
commodore 64 - joystick only - for the last song.  anyways, the music they

Lisa read my review and wants me to rewrite my review to include the
fact that she is not lazy and did not sleep the entire time and did have

a lovely time dancing her butt off for hours.
She was very active and alot of fun.
I am not being forced to write this in any way.

Okay, I have been getting alot of emails and phone calls regarding presale
tickets.  We had them printed up, by Ticketmaster in Toronto.  They were
mailed to my house, but never arrived, and when they were tracked, it said
they were delivered.
So, we have now made our own little cheesy tickets, that will be on sale at
most of the outlets no later than Wednesday.  If you aren't near any of the
locations on the flyer (and NO, there aren't any locations in Cleveland now,
sorry) call the Shortarm infoline and leave your name and city, and we will
hold tickets for you at the door.

Please note that this event will be INDOORS.  That's right, no dust, dirt, or
annoying bugs ;-).  However, please be prepared to deal with the long event.
We don't need kids going overboard on amphetamines or whatever to stay up for
36 hours, so pace yourselves and get some SLEEP.  

If you are flying in for the event (YES, there are people doing this), you
will want to fly into the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.  The venue
is only about 10 minutes from here.  If you need us to arrange transportation
from the airport, this should not be a problem, just please call by THURSDAY. 

Vendors (tape, clothing, music, etc.) must call the Shortarm infoline by
Thursday in order to secure space for vending.  

Lineup and infoline information is listed below.

                                                  The Lineup:

>"You want bigtime!? I'll give you fucking bigtime!!"


Actually, its "You think your big time? You gonna fuckin' die.  Big Time!"

The sample has been used in several records, including a hardcore record by
DJ Paul.

If memory servers, the one you want is a record called Carlito's Law.   I
think there were both house and jungle mixes.  I had it on white lable in
'96 and seem to remember hearing it again on a domestic lable last summer.

If you are looking for just that vocal sample, check out

I don't know if anyone else has seen Synthetic Pleasures, but it was a
very interesting film.  It was aimed more at the mainstream, so it wasn't
quite an "informative documentary," but I would attest that these are
people who care about digital culture.

In other words, if you're worried that "Modulations" might be crap, don't
be.

Yeah, up at the independent film festival in cleveland this spring.  It was pretty decent.  I thought it covered the WHOLE scene pretty well.  Maybe to well.  I
mean no single style of artist was covered that much (one or two exceptions here).

We had a chance to talk to the director and his assistant, so that was sweet.  Apparently they had a lot of trouble with people wanting exorbitant fees for using
clips with them in it.  The film cost something along the lines of a million dollars!  For a documentary?

Anyway it was enjoyable and informative.  If you have a chance go check it out.

I can tell you what happened with the schedule.  Hesohi was working his
butt off to make the schedule flow but because of people not knowing quite
when they were going spin things got mixed up.

This is probably what the order would have been if everything went O.K.

Lemon Lynam - Tech House, Techno
Mark Verbos - Techno PA
DRC and then 3d and Snuggles or the other way around depending on what they
wanted.
I was suppose to go on after them at like 5:00am.

When Mark Verbos is finished 3d and Snuggles aren't on stage yet and DRC
wasn't there yet either.  Mark Verbos was only going to do 1/2 hour so they
told me to get my records and be ready just in case since my car was behind
the stage.  Mark finished and I had to go on. Noone else was there.

It wasn't any of the D.J.'s fault or Hesohi's.  Everyone just worked with
what they had.

 Peace and Love

Kids have *never* taken guidance from their parents.  If you could
travel back in time and observe the original primate family in the
original tree, you would see the primate parents yelling at the primate
teenager for sitting around and sulking all day instead of hunting for
grubs and berries like dad primate.  Then you'd see the primate
teenager stomp up to his branch and slam the leaves.

Well I wanted to wait around and read what every one else had to say before i
posted my review.  This party is always something special to me. I have been
to them all and have been going to UPS parties since i started and they were
still eternal peace tribe.  Brian Wheeler is a very good friend of mine and so
i try to support his parties whenever i can.
	To start off I'd like to clear things up.  I know many people thought that
there were alot of drugs there.  This is true, but what did you expect?  This
is like a regular party in any city multiplied by 100.  You see if you go to a
party in whatever city, you will have one or two major drug dealers. the guys
whoi supply the party.  But you have to think that this is the party everyone
goes to, so you have every cities drug dealers all at the same place, trying
to make their money.  
	Drug dealers weren't the only people there to make money.  I think everyone
had brought something to sell or wanted to pimp Family Affair in some way.
You could have driven there naked with no food and come out fat as hell and
new clothes on your back as long as you had some money.  Hell we even had a
guy try to charge us for keeping some sound equipment under his tarp!!!  Get
real people!!!
	Well here is my review of the party.  Most of the columbus crew caravaned and
got there about 3:00.  After checking in and getting my pass, we proceeded to
find our site right at the top of the hill next to the little pavilion.  Great
spot!!!  After drinking beers and playing frisbee for a while, i was
approached by my boy HESOHI who was handling the lineup for the main stage
that night.  he said i would probably be playing on saturday night. I wasn't
stressed about it. i really didn't care.  After a while Brandon came up to me
and told me i was playing at 2:00am on the main stage. I was excited, but not
holding my breath, because i know how a brian wheeler party runs(no disrespect
at all).  So it is finnally night, and we run down to hear Titonton throw down
a fat ass live set. 614 reprazent!!!  After that we listend to lion play for a
while before heading up to the tent so we didn't have to hear DINKY or
whatever!  at that time the lineup was still intact and looking to be fat as
hell.  When we decided to go back down, around 12:30, i discovered that
everything had changed and there were these hip hopper assholes trying to
bully there way on stage talkin about they were supposed to have 2 hours and
this and that.  Causing all kinds of drama and pushing My boy Doug around.
The crowd had formed itching to hear some continuous beats, and they were
getting Bar-B-Q sauce from some terrible group.  Finnally Brian shows up and
sets things straight. pulls the band off and tells me to get my shit and go
on.  So i did.  What a great time.  After that we listend to Mark verbos and
then watched Trevo Lamont throw down!!!!! The rest of the night was a bit
fuzzy, but i know it was a blast from then on.  
	Saturday: Tried to sleep for a while. Unfortunately my ears were being
punished by some dj spinning the worst music i have ever heard right near our
tent.  So I wandered and talked to some friends.  SPun a tag team set at the
collective sound systm with my boy James Temple and just all around kicked it
before finnal;y falling asleep at 4:00. woke up and cooked dinner and chilled
before dark and tried to stay out of the drama.  "Who is playing tonight?" was
the question on everones mind. but then again have you ever been to a family
affair and known who was playing on saturday night?  The party started bad
again.  we never heard any good music for the firsat half of the night.
Finnally around 2 we  decide to head down. There had to be good music soon
right?  We endured the rebel crew for a while and then BOOOOOM!  When Roy
Davis Jr. went on it was ilke the signal to say "Everything is ok now and you
all can have a good time now. sorry it took us so long this year."  From then
on out, it was a blast.  K alexi was prettyy good, and i caught some of
Goodwills set before catching the rumer that HESOHI was about to play on the
stage over the hill.  Gathered up my crew and ran over to meet all the rest of
my friends at the other stage to listen toi a very personal and soulfull set
of deep minimal house music.  Best music of the weekend period!!!  if you
missed this, you missed the whole point of "FAMILY AFFAIR".  This was the best
feeling i had had all weekend.  Thanks DOug!!!!!!! We will make it!!!  After
that James Went on and during his set the rumer came over the hill that the
party was shut down, and James was the only DJ still playing. I thought "Wow!
We started the party friday night, and ended it sunday morning!"  WIth that it
was off to hang out with my athens crew and survey the after math of the
weekend with my girl Jan!(Jan you are my best friend!!!!!!!!!!  I loved
walking with you in the morning!)  After that I went back to my tent pulled
out my sleeping bag and laid in some shade outside thinking about the whole
weekend.	
	To sum it up, Less than expected, but more than I could have ever hoped for.
You have to realize this isn't just a party.  As my girl RObin said, it is a
whole package!  Who cares if this big name dj didn't show. If the music is
good(and it was for pretty much all weekend if you knew where to look) and you
have all of these new and old faces around you, then it will be a good time.
I will remember every Family affair, but this is the one that will stick out
in my mind forever!!!  I hope to see everyone next year!!!

Peace,
Jason Lyman

i had a great time at this party...

minor negatives:

mother nature (the rain sucked, and at night/early morning it was kinda
cold!!)
a couple of djs were just painful to listen to...trainwreck after
trainwreck...
bum pills everywhere...

we got there late on friday night...set up the tent...walked around and
bumped into people we knew...crashed at 2am cuz the drive from DC was
exhausting...

throughout saturday i just felt kinda blah...mainly due to the drizzle
and lack of sunshine...and the main stage being down...then when the
main stage went up, it wasn't really my kinda music (it was reggae i
think)...and when i went to sit at the side stage near my tent (near the
teepee), the dj was horrible...i admit it seemed he was spinning with
heart...but he lacked some basic beat-matching skills...since not much
was going on, we decided to head out for dinner...went to this
"amish-style" family restaurant...woah...big culture shock considering
where we've been for the past 20 hours...

went to the main stage at around 1am...laid in the grass for god know's
how long...then i hear "atomic babies!"...jump up and trot down closer
to the stage...at around this time my night just took off...i was
excited cuz i didn't realize they were going to be there...major bonus
surprise...only other time i heard them was at april foolz, and
conditions at *that* party weren't that great to say the
least...anyways...went back up the hill after their set to lay down in
the grass and stare at the stars...roy davis came on and was just
perfect for me...listening to his set and looking down at the lights and
people at the main stage area was amazing...it was bizarre to be able to
watch a party from such a distance...surreal...

it was around 4/5am when i started to freeze my ass off...headed back to
put on some jeans...to my surprise and delight, the side stage next to
my tent was in full effect...from here on until 7am, it was absolutely
incredible...chill house...a tight vibe with people crowded around the
stage...the hippie crew from the bus next to the stage...stars in the
sky, slowly fading as the sun creeped in and turned the sky light
purple...the sparklers someone handed out to everyone...definitely the
highlight of my weekend...

two other things i loved:

the tent with the lighted "open" sign across from the pavilion stage
near the showers...that tent was pumping out some of the best music all
weekend...anyone know who they were?

the abused baby lawn ornament!!! anyone see that?? it was holding a beer
can and had a cigerette in it's mouth...on friday night it was motorized
and was moving it's arms and legs...that shit was hilarious!!

Haven't seen it, but I've heard that its a worthy viewing - although its
really hard to tackle all the angles of such an abstract idea on one VHS

Just wondering if Friday was 'Take a strange chemical and freak
out all night' for everyone. It sure as hell was for me. Funny
thing is, I would never have taken that much is I hadn't been on
really awesome e at the time. Slept maybe 30 minutes between Friday
morning and 5:00 am Sunday. Actually had a damn good time except
for that four hour period where reality left me. Hurt my knee 
running away! ;-)

Amy,

Sounds great.  Coventry is an area worth checking out if you're unfamiliar
with Cleveland (it's in Cleveland Hts.).

BTW, what exactly is "dicking around"?  :)

hi guys-i'm about to go to the dentist (who just happens to be my dad but
that's besides the point.)  i hate going to the dentist-it's so scary and i
haven't been there for a while so that means that i'm going to have some major
drilling done.  :(  i'm so scared!  ah well, i hope everyone had a good time
at family affair.  i thought that it was a pretty good party but i was a
little disappointed with the music.  the people were all really nice.  thanks
to max!!!!  he helped me trip for the first time for free.  i don't really
know if i liked it but i think it really helped me mellow out that night.
apologies to rich-i was that asian girl in the visor.  i don't think you
remembered who i was.  i kind of felt stupid but that's also besides the
point.  :)  well, hope to see everyone at phunktion. i'm still debating
whether or not i want to try and pull off the whole weekend.  we'll see!!!!
take care.
off to be tortured...
sharon

> I thought Amp was cancelled.

nope...i just read a little blurb in mixmag yesterday that said that
despite rumors, amp is not going to be cancelled...i think it's going
through some overhauls or something though...they're fiddling with the
format a little i think...not sure...didn't pay much attention to what i
was reading...

has anyone seen this mixmag? 1.8.7. is on the front cover with her new
look!

Sounds great.  Coventry is an area worth checking out if you're unfamiliar

Heyhey!!
The dayz are just going by to slow before function!  Last week I was all down
in the dumps because I didn't have $$$ to go to family affair after my move
from DC.  I was left in Cleveland with a few other unfortunate souls.  I made
my way to trilogy on friday and it was pretty empty. Then did the fam thing on
saturday(Armeggedon go seE it, it kickz A$$).  Then sunday tried trilogy
again...strippers EEEEKKKK!!!  Well I found out the other things to do around
town and I can't wait to check them out.  I'm really looking foward to meeting
people from the list.  Will there be a NET-MEET time and location?  I don' t
know if ya'll do this.  But some of the kidz in DC would have net meetz at
parties.  It was a good way to place FACES to screenames.

Welp that about does it.  
Moseley

here are some of the more educated comments from the FA4 web site...

brandon of UPS sed:
<<I am not a promoter.
I designed and paid for this website.
I have not been compensated.
actually i lost alotta money.
My girlfriend and I got a buncha stuff stolen from our tent while we were 
driving all over ohio picking up / dropping off djs.she doesn't have alotta 
clothes left. She cried many times this weekend, I hate seeing her cry.
I danced for about 5 minutes while Roy Davis Jr. was spinning. 
It was a nite for classic house tracks. I had fun for that 5 minutes.
If you  wanna vent, or tell everyone you had a good 
time despite all the bullshit, hit up our message board
People make the scene. 
P.S. Ralphie Dee, if you're reading this, please don't forget to send 
Astral Matrix their sampler. TODAY. I'm sure they miss it>>

<<So - the weekend is over.... Not a minute too soon. The following is my 
two cents on the party; and some behind the scenes goings on that I think
everyone should know about. Who am I? I'm the guy that spent 
three days designing the sound system for the main stage, only to discover 
that it was a complete waste of time; volume level had to be 10% of the 
systems capability after dark. Anyways - We (our sound company) 
we immersed into the deepest cesspool of bullshit we had ever seen - 
and it started the minute we got there. 
To all you DJ's I argued with: You have my most sincere apologies. Our 
nerves were non-existent, and we were terrified of threats we had recieved 
regarding the safety of our sound gear. High hopes abound.... we were all 
VERY excited to be a part of this production. But - do the math.... approx 
6,000 people at approx $40 per head = about $240,000. So - how come I had to 
risk a fight to get my minute percentage of that? How come DJ's didn't get
paid
their fair share? WHERE DID ALL THE MONEY GO?????? Why did people 
LIE to me? Why did people THREATEN me? Why did my good friend and 
colleague have $12,000 worth of lighting equipment stolen in an act of
retaliation
against the PROMOTERS???? WE were left to clean up the mess - DJ's coming 
to us IN TEARS on Sunday morning asking if we knew where the promoters 
were... The beautiful light show on the main stage was never paid for. After 
weeks of design and hard work and excitement, The lighting crew has NOTHING 
to show for it - juat a bad taste in their mouth. I AM VENTING - I'M SORRY FOR
THAT. I'll be back. Please feel free to email me. We can talk about the
weekend. 
OH - by the way: All of you who got FUCKED by the promoters, don't let them
get 
away with it - call and write. Whatever you can do. Peace and love to all who 
attended, and to all those who stood behind the right; and scowled at the
wrong. 
We love you, and will continue on.... The Ohio scene is vibrant, we just 
need to FORGET this weekend ever happened. We love you. >>


Posted by Ruffian on July 07, 1998 at 02:35:59:

<<This came from my manager/pal, who went thursday nite to assist 
the UPS crew: The top pavilion was shut down by the soundman 
(another pal), due to the fact that he would not be getting paid the agreed 
upon amount (SUX REAL BAD CUZ I HAD A 3 AM SLOT!). Many other 
performers/crewmen did not get paid either...
MAIN REASON for NON-PAYMENT:
It is believed that someone within/working for UPS stole a large amount 
of cash from the gate. (Large amount = roughly 2 boxes worth of bracelets, 
or $40,000...500x2x$40). The empty bracelet boxes were being used to 
temporarily store the cash...2 of them were found in the trash can at the gate
(minus cash.)
MY POINT:
Do not be so quick to judge UPS as being "greedy/in it for the money/etc." 
As a former promoter speaking from experience (best known event: 
TUNNELVISION, Pgh'95) unfortunately this shit HAPPENS. Also, 
overdoses happen...(anyone remember "naked man" at TV?) BUT we 
should be told the truth about the DEATH RUMORS (here on this 
messageboard). ONE MORE THING:
I *think* the reason the party finally came to an early halt had to do 
with another overdose...I saw an ambulance/pigs by the ice truck as 
the sad but inspiring announcement was being made. Don't blame all 
that went wrong on UPS, they did a good job of keeping shit together, 
considering all the circumstances (original space flooded/nearby houses/
asshole cops/overdoses/fake dealers/etc.) I know what it's like to lose 
one's ass on an event, but I don't think ANY of us know quite what it's 
like to lose $40,000 AND a decent reputation, for circumstances BEYOND 
control...So how 'bout a little sympathy for UPS instead of a bunch of 
PISSIN' and MOANIN'? Maybe the lineup was unstable, maybe some 
DJs didn't come for whatever reason, but I sure had fun despite it all... 
>8^]>
I'm sure many would agree...
Brian, my sincere condolences.
DON'T GIVE UP...just hire help you can>>

well, i was thinking like a friendly gathering (with friendly weather and
friendly music and friendly food) in some kind of park-like area *near*
coventry and not actually *in* coventry because there are large populations
of freekz in that area that im not really interested in spending my saturday
afternoon with...but yeah, i would hope it could be free and maybe bring
your own picniparty supplies -or- if we could get enough people to say they
were definitely coming we could divide up the responsibilities for the
essentials...

and i'm willing to break out my decks and mixer if someone can come up with
a way to get a sound system.  if it's free in the cleveland area i could
come pick it up on friday afternoon or saturday probably.  (only in good
weather)

did i mention that if it's not nice weather all bets are off?  i had enough
outdoors and rain this past weekend ;)

uuuum, i dunno probably about 20 minutes or sumtin it's in Cleveland Heights,
close to university circle. U just take 480 towards cleveland, then hop on 271
noorth towrds Eerie, then u get off on the Brainard Ext, take a left at the
light, cruise for about a minute till u hit mayfield rd, there's gonna be a BP
station when u hit mayfield. take a left on mayfield and drive all the way
down till u hit coventry which would be on yur left.

sounds good to me, it's suppose to be nice on saturday isnt it? anyways i
understand you about the freaks on coventry ..... lotta tortured souls walking
around ;) but a nice gathering (in actual sun light so we can all see what we
really look like) would be a nice side party to compliment phunction. is
anyone up for it?

	I know it's been a while since the party, but could anyone please
e-mail me any Sub Phunc 27 pictures, if you have them? We are going through
updating our web site (which actually happens on a daily basis), and the
only pHryL. party we're missing pictures from is SP 27.

We will give the proper credit to anyone that submits pictures that we will
use on our site. If you want to check out what's already there, you can do
so by checking the OLDSKEWL pHryL. section on http://www.pHryL.com 

We also just started a bulletin board on our site (http://www.phryl.com/bb),
along with the existing guestbook. Feel free to post any comments,
suggestions, reviews or just tell us what's up.

We appreciate your help and cooperation in advance.

Concerning this weekend's PHUNKTION, all the DJ's are already on the
Continent and ready to make the journey down to Cleveland on Friday and/or
Saturday. There is a possible surprise guest DJ (somehow rumors have started
on who that is). Nothing will be announced until this person is confirmed.
If and when he is confirmed, the information will be posted here and on our
web site and the info-lines. Therefore, please don't give in to or spread
any speculations. We believe that the talent that has already been gathered
is substantial for an enjoyable weekend of music and fun, regardless of your
musical tastes and musical knowledge (i.e. whether you're an old school, new
school, a party rookie, etc.) or the reasons why you go to parties.

Please decide among yourselves if and when do you want the net-meet to occur
(and please spread the word/post this information to other lists if
necessary). We will have an assigned area for this during Friday and
Saturday nights, and Saturday during the day, if needed.

Please drive safely where-ever you are coming from

Ciao, 
Viktor

all i have to say is this:

'im sorry but me and my fuckthesyst3m bumper sticker are gonna be in
cleveland that nite'

yes thats the same nite as the formation tour in cleveland...shyfx, ss,
johnb, mc warren g (all uk...have u heard of any of them?) and
dieselboy...and thats just the jungle room...theres two other rooms as
well. hmm ive seen that entire lineup that will be in dtroit multiple times
at many similiar parties...

i have been to momentum, escape velocity, interstellar one, blah blah..jj

hi everyone :)

im totally down with the picnic thingy...can i make one small little
request tho?

like kate said, there are those of us who are into drum n bass, and we'd
like to hang out with yall as well...there's a window between 6-9pm sat
nite that would work out will for the kids into jungle who also want to
hang out...

what might end up as the most effective solution would to have it most of
the afternoon going til 9 or so (so that even ppl who arent going to the
party...all two of them ;) ...can enjoy the festivities etc etc)...

feedback?

peace,
hossam

Well, if I spin, you get stuck with the following.

Jungle, Garage, Speed House, Oldskool House, New House, House, Oldskool,
Dance, Trance, Ambient, DnB, and more. Oh, and Zeppelin. That's a mandatory
thing with me. ;)

philip :)

im looking forward to hearing such an eclectic mixture of tunes, but i
would still like to support my friends who are spinning AT the event, as
well as check out some of the dj's who i havent gotten a chance to hear
yet...during the afternoon. 

this was just a point of clarification type post...aka waste of everyone's
time :)

peace,

     Methamphetamine 

MDA  = 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine
MDMA = 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
MDEA = 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine
MBDB = N-methyl-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-butanamine
MMDA = 3-methyoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine
2C-B = 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromo-phenethylamine
Meth = Methamphetamine, N-methyl-phenylisopropylamine

While "Ecstasy" is ideally MDMA, there are several related drugs which
are commonly substituted for it.  By far the commonest substitutes are 
MDA
and MDEA.  Both MDA and MDEA are chemically and psychologically very 
similar
to MDMA.  Because of their chemical similarity they tend to be almost as 
easy
as MDMA to produce, while they don't involve the use of methylamine 
which is
also involved in the production of crystal meth and is heavily watched 
by
the DEA.  MDA used to be quite common, although it's popularity has 
waned.
It tends to have much more amphetamine-like side effects (jaw clenching, 
tremors, etc) along with more psychedelic effects (mild hallucinations) 
and
tends to last appx 1 1/2 times as long as MDMA (with about 1 1/2 hours 
to
the initial come-on as compared to around an hour for MDMA, and with 
about
6-8 hours duration rather than 4-5 hours) it also tends to be much more
'stoning' and doesn't really facilite communication (or probably 
dancing)
as well.  MDEA tends to have a very similar chronology to MDMA and is 
actually
somewhat 'cleaner' and may have fewer amphetamine-like side-effects.  
However,
it also tends to be more 'stoning' than MDMA and may not facilitate 
communication or be as energetic as MDMA.  MDEA is getting substantially 
more
and more prevalent, and it's likely that more MDEA is being sold as 
"Ecstasy"
than MDMA (1998).

It is particularly important to note the widespread occurance of MDEA as 
a
substitute drug in "Ecstasy" since MDEA-like effects (particularly the 
non-energetic feeling and fuzzy-headedness) are sometimes reported as 
being
"evidence" of heroin-laced MDMA.  Such E experiences are likely just 
MDEA.
MDA may be the source of the rumor that "Ecstasy is a combination of
speed, LSD and cocaine" since it tends to be more psychedelic, more 
speedy
and can be more euphoric.  The frequency of this rumor appears to have
decreased and this may correllate to the decrease in the availability of
MDA.

MBDB is chemically different enough from MDMA/MDA/MDEA to make the 
synthesis
substantially different and not as simple as just substituting one 
chemical
for another in the reaction.  MBDB appeared in Holland and Europe after 
the
Dutch made MDEA (along with MDA and MDMA) illegal.  The Dutch again made
MBDB illegal and it's popularity will probably wane since it is more 
difficult
synthesis and there are no benefits of legal status.  It is supposed to 
be
similar to MDMA, but missing some of the stimulation of MDMA and the 
ease of
communication (and probably dancing) but not as 'stoning' as MDEA or 
MDA.
It's doubtful that MBDB has or will make a substantial appearance on the
american markets, since it could be prosecuted under the analog drug 
act.

MMDA is included mostly for completeness -- it has never made an 
appearance
on the market, but there is really no reason for it not to, other than 
it
requires a synthesis from a different precursor than MDMA.  It should be
similar to MDA in that it is reported to have more hallucinations.

2C-B is normally sold as 2C-B (or "Nexus" or "Bromomescaline" or an old
street term was "CBr").  This isn't commonly sold as "Ecstasy", but it 
can
be and has.  It has a substantially faster come on and total chronology 
than
MDMA, being only about 4 hours in length total.  It lacks the 
'entactogenesis'
or emotional warmth of drugs like MDA/MDMA/MDEA and tends to be a little 
bit
'trippy' but usually not as intense as LSD or mushrooms.  2C-B is also 
substantially more potent, being effective at 10-25mg and sometimes 
comes
in much smaller sized pills than MDMA (of course pills can always be 
packed
with filler...)

Methamphetamine is 'speed' and is similar to MDMA in creating energy, 
causing insomnia and such, but it lacks the emotional warmth of MDMA.  
It
also tends to have a much longer chronology, and a large dose of speed 
can
cause one to stay up for 24 hours and longer.

In summary:

Characteristics                            Probable drug
------------------------------             -------------
similar duration, spacey                   = MDEA
longer duration, trippy, speedy            = MDA
short duration, trippy, maybe small pills  = 2C-B
energetic, even harder time sleeping after = methamphetamine

THE PRICE STRUCTURE/POTENCY ARGUMENT AGAINST HEROIN-LACED ECSTASY

First of all, heroin is about 4x less effective taken orally than smoked
or snorted.  Secondly heroin comes in two forms, one is white ("china
white") and one is tar ("brown tar").  White is more highly refined 
heroin,
while the tar is less potent and contains many impurities.  Tar is about
4x less potent than white, while white tends to cost about 4x as much.

Availability and price of heroin will depend on locale.  On the west 
coast
of the USA, white is fairly hard to find, while tar tends to predominate
and tends to be around $100/gm of tar.  For a heroin neophyte the lowest
active dose of heroin when smoked would probably be around 100mg.  A 
more
usual dose for a more regular user would be 250mg, while junkies could 
use
substantially more than that.  Taken orally, a person would need to take
about 400mg of tar to be able to feel it and this would cost around $40.

Now, two important points about this are the cost and the amount.  Most 
important for tar heroin is the amount.  You simply don't generally see
E pills which weigh upwards of 500mg, which is what would be required in
order to get a pill with an active quantity of tar in them.  Since most
E pills don't even weigh much more than 200mg, filler included, there's
no way that you could possibly get an active amount of tar heroin in 
them.  To emphasize an important point:  EVEN IF THOSE BROWN FLAKES IN 
YOUR
E WERE HEROIN, THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD FEEL IT.  40mg of tar is going 
to
be 1/10th of an active dose.

Now, even with west coast (USA) china white, the cost of a single oral 
dose
of white is going to be around $40.  At this price it is going to cost 
more
than the E that you're trying to 'cut' it with and it makes much more 
sense
to sell it at a higher profit to a junkie, who will come back to you for
more and be a consistant customer.  It is theoretically possible to sell 
white
as E since it's only about 100mg per effective oral dose, but doing this 
will
be completely ineffective at getting people hooked on your stuff.  It 
makes
much more sense to sell heroin users heroin if you're looking to create 
a
market.

It has been reported that on the East coast (USA) white is substantially 
more
prevalent and cheaper, running more like $200/gm or $20 for 100mg.  This 
is
still as expensive as E, and it's unlikely that anyone would attempt to
'cut' their E with this -- it would probably make for a batch of pills 
that
were weakly E and very weakly heroin, or else you'd have to put enough E
or heroin into it to get the user off of one or the other by itself and 
then
add the cost of the other drug on top of it -- making for some fairly 
expensive pills, and a much better profit to be made by just selling the
heroin as heroin.  Concievably heroin could be pressed into pills by 
itself
and sold at raves as E, but again the dealer can do better by selling 
heroin
to heroin users.

ANALYSIS OF LAB SAMPLES OF MDMA

{mostly just www.ecstasy.org...  needs to be filled in}

ACTUAL ACCOUNTS OF "HEROIN-LACED ECSTASY"

One real-life account of actual heroin laced ecstasy has been passed on 
to
me by a source that I tend to belive is reliable.  The story that was
related to me was that a rave promoter in the Seattle area, circa 1992, 
was
lacing their E with heroin.  What they were doing was cutting their E at
a rate of about 100mg of white heroin to 1/8th of an ounce (3.5gm) of E.
This is about 1 effective oral dose of heroin per 35 doses of E.  It 
increased
to price of the MDMA by about $1 a pill, but the actual amount of heroin 
in
the E was barely a trace.  The rationale that the rave promoter used was 
in
fact that they were trying to get people 'hooked' on their E.  Of 
course, this
is as effective as attempting to get hooked on cocaine by snorting the 
residue which is present on most of the $20 bills that have been in
circulation.  This was just a waste of some perfectly good china white.

Another story was related by davey@vii.com on alt.rave, where he claims 
to
have had a sample of MDMA tested which turned up as having contained 
heroin
in them.  This happened in 1995 and he described it as:

  ``The pill I purchased was in fact a wafer and quite large.  For a 
pressed
   tab it would have easily have been 650mg or more.  Most people taking 
them
   in the Portland scene back then were cutting them in half or even 
quarters
   to take.  Many of the ravers there were regular heroin users that 
claimed
   the simularities of the effect.'' <6jt0j4$ru$1@nnrp1.dejanews.com>

Notice that the pill was *HUGE*.  While davey didn't retain the sample
analysis, this seems somewhat believable as the appearance of the pill 
is
highly atypical.  It's strange enough to be true.  The moral of this 
story 
is not to take drugs that *look* whack.  E pills should be 150-200mg or 
so,
not 650mg monsters.  Similarly, if you're taking *small* pills and still
getting off, you aren't taking MDMA.

These accounts are rare and unusual.

"REAL-LIFE" REPORTS OF "SMACKY E's" WHICH AREN'T.

Many people report having taken "Smacky E."  Under most every 
circumstance
it turns out that these people describe effects that could easily be 
accounted for by another drug other than heroin.  Users commonly report
that they "didn't have the energy to dance" probably due to having taken
MDEA instead of MDMA.  Some people might get a low dose of ketamine and
mistake the spacey/dreamy feeling of Ketamine for Heroin.  Some people
mistakenly attribute normal effects of MDMA to being Heroin.  MDMA 
causes
nausea, vomiting and jaw grinding (and higher doses or snorting the MDMA
may cause increased side-effects), while these side-effects are 
sometimes
attributed incorrectly to heroin.  Nausea, in particular, is a common
side effect of serotonergic drugs (e.g. MDMA, Prozac, LSD, Mescaline) 
and
increased doses or faster routes of adminstration (snorting) may 
increase
them, along with various other factors (e.g. what you ate prior to 
dosing,
how comfortable you feel, and the phase of the moon).

These accounts of "smacky E" are common and almost universally mistaken.

hi everyone...

1)-just wanted to see who all is planning on going to phunktion this w/e...can
we get a list going? please include your name and where you are coming
from...i'l get the ball rolling...


hossam  --  pittsburgh


2)- can someone (preferably someone who lives in/is familiar with
cleveland) please take charge of the picnic in terms of deciding upon
a location (someone had suggested a park near coventry....which is a cool
area, i used to live near there), or one of the cleveland metroparks...but
anyway, someone needs to go ahead and pick a place, a time, etc. etc...who
will volunteer for this project?

my only suggestion is please have it run til the late afternoon/early
evening (8-9pm) so that we can all make it, and as far as food goes, it
should be bring your own, share what you want to....but please try not 
to come empty handed if possible (so any of you with special dietary needs
bring what u need) ((god shoot me i cant beleive im becoming this
anal...;))

re: music....gill volunteered the use of his 1200's and a cheap
mixer...someone else mentioned something about a pc to play mp3's (philip?)
so someone should get on the case and sort that business out...

ok enuff of me, im going back to color coordinating my socks...;)


peace,
hossam

Would anyone going from Pittsburgh consider giving me a ride? I'll help
pay for gas/food/whatever and be extremely grateful! Thanks :)

I'm confused about this picnic. How close will it be to Phunktion? 
If I can make it, what should I bring?

p.s. This is rather late for a review, but Projekthaus was wonderful -
the music intense, the sound rig impressive, the garden surreal, the sky
beautiful, the food delicious, and you people all so friendly and neat
to talk to. *Tao smiles happily at the memory and virtually hugs you.*

Okay, I have been getting alot of emails and phone calls regarding presale
tickets.  We had them printed up, by Ticketmaster in Toronto.  They were
mailed to my house, but never arrived, and when they were tracked, it said
they were delivered.
So, we have now made our own little cheesy tickets, that will be on sale at
most of the outlets no later than Wednesday.  If you aren't near any of the
locations on the flyer (and NO, there aren't any locations in Cleveland now,
sorry) call the Shortarm infoline and leave your name and city, and we will
hold tickets for you at the door.

Please note that this event will be INDOORS.  That's right, no dust, dirt, or
annoying bugs ;-).  However, please be prepared to deal with the long event.
We don't need kids going overboard on amphetamines or whatever to stay up for
36 hours, so pace yourselves and get some SLEEP.  

If you are flying in for the event (YES, there are people doing this), you
will want to fly into the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.  The venue
is only about 10 minutes from here.  If you need us to arrange transportation
from the airport, this should not be a problem, just please call by THURSDAY. 

Vendors (tape, clothing, music, etc.) must call the Shortarm infoline by
Thursday in order to secure space for vending.  

Lineup and infoline information is listed below.

Well, I have a little experience planning picnics for this group -- and it
really was a nightmare.  Last summer at this time (check the archives), I
planned a picnic at a local Metropark.  I went to several locations, found
the best campground with ample everything, and secured it.  Then, I
advertised it for about two weeks on the list.  A grand total of *zero*
people showed! 

Zero!

I had bought a lot of food and drinks and I sat there all by myself all
afternoon looking like an idiot as ants crawled all over me.

I would love to have this picnic work out, but let's be realistic here.
We will all be exhausted and will sleep until mid afternoon.  Then, many
will want to return early for Product 19's performance (oh, ya, that's
just me).  The point is . . . I have more faith in organizing a net meet
than organizing a picnic.  There are transportation issues, food, timing
constraints, location choice -- not to mention weather concerns.  

*** Better Idea *** 

If we want to meet, let's meet at Arabica for coffee at a designated time. 
Then, should the group want to do so, we can all have dinner at Que Tal or
Tommy's.  It's a lot more logical and practical. Coventry is the meeting
point.  Who's with me?????

Intergalactic Circus is not cancelled.  The NGL/Metropol guys did renig on
the Crane but it all worked out even better in the end.  It will be at an
ice rink about 25 min. from downtown Pittsburgh.  It will now be a 2 room
event with added extras to be announced.  (Good ones, I promise!)   This
party has been in the works for over 4 months and has the heart and soul
of Downlow and 5 Star.  We promise the area an event like they've never
seen before (trust me).  This party will revert back to classic rave
style. (Costumes, color, glitter and fanfare encouraged!)  Lots o' special
suprises.  Check the info. line as the date draws near.

OK, I've been corrected in calling the venue and "ice rink".  It's more than
that.  It's an arena sized rink where professionals play.  That might give
some sort of visual to think about.  In any case, the show will go on.-Kelly

I'd like to hear everyone's idea for ONE DJ or LIVE ACT that's either never been
in the area (Pittsburgh) or hasn't been in a while, that you'd like to see at a
party.  We're planning our next event and want some feedback.   Answer whether
you're from the 'burgh or not.
Thanks

In a message dated 98-07-09 00:55:20 EDT, you write:

<< if someone wanted to get into throwing parties....what would be the easiest
and most effective way to get started...other than winning the lottery and
having enormous ammounts of connections??? >>

First and Foremost, SECURE A SPACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  After this is set,
everything else will fall into place.

okay seriously ... i'd like to see one major headliner like frankie bones,
carlos, or dante spin out a long (6< hours) ny club-style set.  i had a wet
dream once where a party with a superstar dj was cheap because it was backed
only by locals product 19, instigator, smoov, smartie, the 5-star crew, spike,
terry kicks, and this one versatile black dj who used to do soba wednesdays
and the hip-hop joke at chameleon.  (not tommy illnigga.)

multiple rooms and outdoor areas are such a big deal to me too, but i suppose
the question was not about venue but the dj?  

okay then how about dieselboy.  i don't think he's been in town since the
1-hour set he played at steelcityjungle like a year ago.

please/peace,
david

ps i read in one of those trendy spinurbdigitliquidmixmags that danny tenaglia
is planning a tour ... hint ...

Jul 10-12               TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL                    Texas

[major far away, but really looks fun!!!!  WOo-HA! lots of camping for me
this summer!!!]

As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every major
Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this great
cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and some
of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if you
will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and volunteers
will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment. Any
profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed us
in the morning! Bring a can good if you can.

Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
"Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998. Dripping
Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and lots
of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as well.
Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through our 2
gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday. This
is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
tents, beach balls, kites...whatever.

QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said "So if you want a
touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a huge dollop of raveyness,
then this is the place to be. Just don't forget to pack the toilet paper
along with the tent. After all this is the great outdoors!"

  the sound throughout the night will have both balance and progression,
  so you can always choose between two styles, or experience a flow of
  sound (dub-dancehall-jungle-hardcore-techno-trance-house).  There will
  definitely be some music you don't hear at every rave - both slow and
  fast tempos - but it will all be good.

  we'll be providing lots of fun stuff in addition to the music & lights,
  including toy prizes, free fruit, face painting, as well as other drinks
  (not alcohol) candy and water ($1) will be for sale.

  parking at the venue is limited, so we advize carpooling with at least 3
  (more is better) people in your vehicle.  we'll also be setting up some
  kind of carpool or shuttle.  leave a message on our line or email us
  (pbsproductions@hotmail.com) if you're interested in this.

  one thing we want to let everyone know: this event is about nothing more
  than having a good time, and grooving to the music!  have phun, but
  be responsible.  this music and culture are special -  we don't want it
  commodified and sold as a product. please respect the space and
  don't tag. don't bring drugs, weapons or ill attitudes.
  thanks to all the folks who've helped us this far - you're great!

  If you have any questions or comments,
   email us: pbsproductions@hotmail.com,
  or leave a message on the infoline 412-734-8334

Sounds like you should check out some other clubs...like Aqua or U4ia...Aqua's a
new one and I've heard it's a pretty diverse croud...and of course we all know
flaming U4ia!

     yeah, i heard something like this too.
     i was told the crane was under renovation
     or something, and so it was out...

     you're using an ice rink? cool.

     seems like venues in this fair city are a 
     problem. one would think with all the 
     derelict industrial installations that it
     would be different. but no.

sorry for that last screwup...



i'm gonna be coming up to cleveland on fri with andy sine...however he has
to leave on saturday for another gig, so i was wondering if anyone from pgh
would be able to give me a ride hom from the party?

IDEALLY :) (this is a stretch) i would love to stay in clevland and watch
the brasil v france match which starts at 3pm....and leave immediately
thereafter...i can arrange crash space b/w the party's conclusion (9am) and
the start of the match (3pm)....

SOOOO if anyone is down with this, please let me know.. the fact remains
that i need a ride back to pgh...and if i have to leave at 9am i will (gas
tolls, help driving, etc etc gladly offered)....

please reply to me asap :)


re: the beastie boys.. aug 14 the concert.

aug 15. phorm.


i will be doing both. (hopefully ;)


peace,
hossam

say hi to David Hollands for me. I love that kid....

SO, about these various failed net-meet thingees, how about this...you guys
come here! :) Okay, so it's selfish, I know, but I have a good excuse for this
one. Is anyone planning on coming to Sensual in Cincinnati September 4th? It's
being thrown by my friends with the CBS, and they are bringing Jam Master Jay
here to town. Should be fun! Not only that, but this just happens to be MY
BIRTHDAY! Not just any birthday, but my 21ST BIRTHDAY!!!!! Yeah! So how 'bout
it kids? Why not come down and we'll all celebrate my birthday together :)
Yippee! Keep your calendars open :)

Okay, since no one has dared to get specific, here's what I'll propose:

On Saturday afternoon, let's meet on the cement steps outside of Coventry
Arabica @ 4:00.  We'll get some mocha's and coffee, hang out, and then
either proceed to Tommy's or Captain Tony's for an informal dinner at 5:30
or 6:00.  If we eat pizza at Captain Tony's, we can do it outside at the
tables with the umbrellas -- these are also just outside of Arabica.

Should this be acceptable, I'll make sure I'm there -- bleary eyed -- at
4:00 on the dot.

If you want to be included, e-mail me and I'll make up a list.  If you
need directions, I'll provide these also. 

Sincerely,

Braden

'lo....

the other day someone accused me of 'starting' this whole picnic - party -
saturday gathering idea...it's not true.  I have not done much since my
initial comments tho, because i had a major test to prepare for and took it
this morning and passed so now i'm ready to get ready for this weekend.

I hear the comments about a one person park party last year and think that
is a great point.  Someone also pointed out to me that the party itself is
supposedly close(r) to the airport and not near coventry at all
(confirmations on that guys?) which would make coventry a cool place to hang
out on saturday afternoon/evening but not a choice location for a sidebar
party at all.  of course, being close to my house is cool in my humbe
opinion..and i'm always right. ;)

SO..the idea about going out for food seems like a good one and peeps don't
have to do so much preparing for it (which is nice because i know how ravers
are and ya just *won't*).

BUT i was kinda hoping to have musics of those unknowns that are on this
list playing quietly in the background.  I won't be heartbroken if that does
not work out, but with the weather being nice and all i would kinda like to
be outside.

THE TOTAL so far seems to be that there will be nice weather but we've got
no sound system.  Tommy's (or any other eatery) will not require
preparation.  A park on the west side would have to be discovered (i know of
a definite hookup of one down near the flats we could use 'till dark *with
power*...you might know of it too...that's closer than coventry to be sure).

So HERE IS THE DEAL::::::;

I am the MOST collected person you know so FOLLOW ME.

use this number for NET-PARTy INFO aLL WEEkENd
		Rain or shine
		AND/or in case of party problems

			216-830-2209
			http://www.topsecret.net/now

as much as last weekend was last weekend, it had hints and traces of
Interstellar Outback 1 all around it.  This weekend is going to be this
weekend but i feel hints and traces of LADyBuST all over it.  (Ladybug
preparty was the original [Top Secret] kickoff event back in '95)

My last day at work is tomorrow and i intend on making the weekend rock and
my apartment is going to be a temporary home to several travelling ravers
this weekend...a veritable party in a box

okay enough rambling....i've got to get back to slacking...

--gill

**ONE MORE THING:

please do not email a copy of all your emails to my personal address, i DO
read the list and can see that your email is important (or not) and do NOT
need another copy of it, thanks.

okay. meeting for coffee and dinner sounds better to me. i mean, the picnic
idea is a super good one, but perhaps we can save it for a day when nothing
else is going on.

Viktor has been kind enough to offer a special location for us to have a
net meet.  I'm going to be taking names.  If you want to be included in
the *Friday* net meet, please e-mail me privately.  Specify that you want
the "net meet".  If you want the Saturday afternoon 4:00 Coventry meeting,
mention that.

I'll post the complete lists tomorrow (Friday) afternoon.

Thanks,

Braden

Actually, anybody who comes w/e to my place will be guaranteed admittance
(provided that they share with me and they aren't being followed by FEDERAL

in the shadows of this grand weekend the world cup FINAL will be played on
Sunday afternoon.  near my pad, near Coventry and at other public houses
worldwide glowing tubes will be broadcasting the madness for remote viewers.

hossam and I have talked it over, and we feel the even if we are stupid
Americans and don't know jack about soccer...err futball, we want to be a
part of the action and are planning on making it to one of those public
houses for said action.  (mostly because my roommate and I have a
no-TV-in-the-apartment rule).

kill your television.

for what it's worth, hossam and I have not gotten so far as to decide
exactly what establishment we'll be viewing said futball match at, but you
can find out on the infoline 216-830-2209, etc.

and also for what it's worth, it is strongly recommended that one does not
consume alcohol or dairy products in any quantity until after your system
has been thoroughly rid of any ecstasy or related compound.  FYI, NYK,
KIHTB, RTFF, ETC.

Whelp, that's a toughie!  Its hard to pick 'just one'.
Are you tryin' to bring one 'huge' act, or just looking for someone else
to add to you're already existing lineup?

Personally, I'd like to see (by no means exhaustive):

- A wicked UK junglist (plus an MC who can rock things):
    Rebel MC, SS, Doc Scott (any metalheads act cept' goldie)

- US jungle:  B-Boy 3000/Raw, Lord Vishnu

- Delta 9, DJ Producer, Speadfreak, Choosen Few (many other Hardcore types)  

- Claude Young

There seems to be a Clarkee fanclub around here - gotta say 
I'd be *mucho* happy if that's who you folks got.  

I'd like the most to see someone who's not on every flyer that I see, 
but blows me away with a wicked set.   I'm happy with about anything on
the harder side of the spectrum. ;)

l8s,
 cutup

A sincere question to all pb-cle massive:

Does anyone know a place where one can rent a van or mini-bus 
(preferably designed for 15-30+ passengers) for a reasonable price?

Or alternatively - does anyone in the pittsburgh area own such a vehicle
that could be rented?

I'd need to rent overnight.

I'm not sure on the exact info, because i got this from the InPgh website:

DJ 7Up, Zemo, Product 19 & Beedie.
 Metropol, Strip. 261-2221. 

I swear that the ad said Alaska was spinning, but maybe i looked at it
wrong. It was pretty cool last week - I had a good time while i was there.
18+ $3, 21+ 2.   It sucks, but they really won't let you in if your not
18 (unlike the fine folks @ laga).

I'm going to try to get there, but no promises.

In less than 24 hours, people from all of the midwest and east cost will come
together under one roof to witness some of the world's finest electronic
musicians perform over a period of 36 hours.  Before this can happen, however,
those people need directions on how to get there. ;-)  Here they are...

People are driving in from such places as Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA; Iowa City,
Iowa, New York City; Albany, NY; Toronto, Ont; Chicago, IL; Detroit, MI;
Pittsburgh, PA; and many other cities in the Midwest and East Coast.  
 
Here are the directions from the general areas around these locations.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS:

>From CHICAGO and surrounding areas: Take 80/90 East to 480.  480 East until
you get to the Ridge Rd. exit.  Turn left after the exit.  Follow the specific
directions.

>From DETROIT and surrounding areas: Take 75 South to 280 South to 90 East.  90
East to 480 East.  Get off at the Ridge Rd. exit.  Turn left after the exit.
Follow the specific directions.

>From UPSTATE NY/TORONTO/ERIE and surrounding areas: Find your way to I-90.
Take 90 West until you get into Cleveland.  Take 90 West to 77 South.  After a
few minutes, get on 480 West.  Take 480 West to the Ridge Rd. exit.  Turn
right after the exit.  Follow the specific directions.

>From NEW YORK CITY and surrounding areas:  Find your way to 80.  Take 80 West
into Ohio.  Get on 77 North.  Take 77 North to 480 West.  Take 480 West to the
Ridge Rd. exit.  Turn right after the exit.  Follow the specific directions.

>From PITTSBURGH and surrounding areas:  Find your way to I-76 (from
Pittsburgh, take 79 North to 76).  Take 76 West to Akron.  Get on 77 North.
Take 77 North to 480 West.  Take 480 West to the Ridge Rd. exit.  Turn right

West to the Ridge Rd. exit.  Turn right after the exit.  Follow the specific
directions.

>From any points other than these, simply find the quickest or closest way to
one of the landmark highways, and follow directions from there.  

SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS:

Once you are heading North on Ridge Rd., you will drive for approximately 5 or
6 minutes.  Just after you pass a set of railroad tracks, the venue will come
up on your righthand side.  The venue is called the USA Skating Place.  It is
a large white building with blue lettering.  It is located in a plaza along
with a bowling alley and a Dave's Supermarket.  The address is 3475 Ridge Rd.
It is located directly on the corner of Ridge and Denison Ave.  If you get
lost, call us there at 216.281.6901 (only in an emergency).  If you have been
to the venue before, it will seem somewhat unrecognizable due to our extensive
decorations.  There will be plenty of free parking available. 

Doors open at 9 pm.  There will be re-entry from approximately 9 am Saturday
until 9 pm Saturday night.  You will need to take a plastic card with you,
sign out with your name and card number, and bring the card back with you to
check in for re-admittance.  

Hope you have a safe trip.

Ya know, just as I was saying to a friend, "remember when we went to
concerts?? Remember when we would go to about 20 concerts or more in a summer?
Wow, those were the days, when bands that I wanted to see came to Cleveland,,,
maybe I just havent been paying attention to band music?" hehe... Well damn, I
looked at scene magazine the other day, and 
1) Beastie Boys & A Tribe Called Quest, August 14th, CSU Convo!!

2) My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, Sunday August 16th, Odeon

3) Modern English, Wednesday, July 29th- Grog Shop

4) Tricky, Friday, July 24th, Odeon

5) Violent Femmes, Sunday, July 12th, Agora... 

Looks like a concert summer for me once again!! Yay!! ;-) Of course I will be
at Front 242!!  I didnt read that one til now!!  I think we should definitely
meet up before the Beastie Boys and Tribe Called Quest. I can hardly believe
Cleveland's luck in getting these two here in the same venue on the same
night...damn!!!!!!!!  Casey

Jul 10-12- TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL -Texas

TEXAS ELECTRONICA FESTIVAL

As you may know every year we try to bring together just about every
major
Texas "rave" or "electronica" act or DJ, for one weekend, in beautiful
Dripping Springs, Texas. Many come and donate their services to this
great
cause, and last year they were asked to pay a $10.00 camping/maintenance
fee to visit the site, nevertheless the talent. On average the talent we
are talking about books from $300-$1500. Many of them are unsigned and
some
of them are simply putting out their own records. It is truly a special
treat to see them all in one location. This is a great "convention" if
you
will; of the best Texas has to offer. This year all talent and
volunteers
will pay nothing and be provided a modestly unlimited supply of food and
drinks. This year we are asking the supporters of this scene to pay a
nominal $15.00 for the weekend of amenities and pure sonic enjoyment.
Any
profit made on this event will go to the Austin Food Bank, and to feed
us
in the morning! Bring a can good if you can. 

Anyway,...back to the convention. The convention of sorts is called the
"Texas Electronica Festival" this year will be the "Second Annual Texas
Electronica Festival". The scheduled date is July 10, 11, 12 1998.
Dripping
Springs is a 45 min drive from Austin (west). Very, very rural. A
ranch-like 100 acres with spring fed swimming hole, rope swing,
porta-potties & fixed restroom facilities, out door showers, indoor
showers, an above ground swimming pool (right next to the stage!) and
lots
of free drinking water. Gates open (for camping only) Friday July 10th.
Gates open 9 am Saturday for ALL. A $15 camping fee is required to cover
maintenance of those amenities through the weekend. Gates will close at
Midnight Sat July 11th, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, gates will be locked for
your safety at Midnight Saturday night and will re-open at 9 am Sun July
12th. We will have everything you need during this timeframe, EMS as
well.
Only under extreme circumstances would you be allowed to pass through
our 2
gates to the outside world between Midnight Saturday and 9 am Sunday.
This
is a campout, please come prepared: bring coolers of food and drinks,
tents, beach balls, kites...whatever. 

QUOTE's : MixMag Fun in the Sun Issue Summer 97 said "So if you want a
touch of Burning Man, a dash of Woodstock, and a huge dollop of
raveyness,
then this is the place to be. Just don't forget to pack the toilet paper
along with the tent. After all this is the great outdoors!"

sound (dub-dancehall-jungle-hardcore-techno-trance-house). There will
definitely be some music you don't hear at every rave - both slow and 
fast tempos - but it will all be good.

including toy prizes, free fruit, face painting, as well as other drinks
(not alcohol) candy and water ($1) will be for sale.

kind of carpool or shuttle. leave a message on our line or email us

one thing we want to let everyone know: this event is about nothing more
than having a good time, and grooving to the music! have phun, but 
be responsible. this music and culture are special - we don't want it
commodified and sold as a product. please respect the space and
don't tag. don't bring drugs, weapons or ill attitudes.
thanks to all the folks who've helped us this far - you're great!

If you have any questions or comments,

Don' fo-get 'bout 'Life is But A Dream' 
 - we gots plenty o' gabba/hardcore
between aneurysm, fishhead and gabbergirl.
Plus wolverine plays some *hard* techno.
and DaMofo will be satisfyin' the happy heads...

But for you kids who aren't into the hardcore, 
don't worry, there's 2 rooms, plus an outdoor 
chill system that will be going on....

well, i didn't get any replies saying anyone was going to the little
Youngstown party yesterday, and no i must say its a good thing...
...i was pretty happy about this party, because it was local, and i was
'really' in the mood to dance...well i took off alittle while after i got off
work, and pulled into the party at about midnight...just in time to see it
getting closed...
...i guess who ever threw the party didn't have a permit for it to go passed
midnight???
...there were alread at least 3 or 4 cop cars there...
...i think i'd have a much more fruitful life as a burglar...all i'd have to
do is check out when the raves are...start running wild with stealing...i mean
i know all hte cops will be staring down innocent kids while i am easily
robbing the city blind....
  well...they started to check id's, so i had to leave, *sigh*   
plus as i was pulling away i saw 2 more police cars pull up (and keep in mind,
there weren't many more than 40 people at the party! )  well i know i'll be
sleeping comfortably knowing our finest, know how to get a good days work of
public protection...

well i guess i'll see everyone, saterday night at Phunktion =^)
damnit i'll get a full night of dancing yet! **crosses her fingers**

one hopeful girlie
and her trusty sidekick, piglet

The net meet for tonight at Phunction will be at:

2:00 A.M. in front of the skate rental booth (this is immediately to the
right of the bathrooms as you face the bathrooms).

The list for those who have signed up is long, so just be there at
2:00ish.  (Don't be shy to ask others if this is the net meet.)

Here is a list of those who are coming for the Saturday afternoon soiree
at Coventry.  If you haven't signed up and want to come, just show up.

*** Time:  4:00 P.M.

*** Place: On the cement steps right outside Arabica (directions for out
of towners is at the end of this message) 

I'll be wearing a bright orange t-shirt and shorts.  So, look for me.

We'll hang out for a while and then have dinner at one of the many great
eateries there (Que Tal, Tommy's, Captain Tony's, ect.)

Here is the list to date:

Braden  balbert@apk.net

Hossam  hae2@po.CWRU.edu

Steve  sford1@neo.lrun.com

James Gill  gill@apk.net

Dave C.  CANADA69@aol.com

????   SenecaOH@aol.com

Danielle  Sleepx2@aol.com

Casey  HANSLGRETL@aol.com

The more the merrier, so feel free to bring friends.

Directions:

Coventry is actually a road in Cleveland Hts.  The strip between Mayfield
and Euclid Hts. Blvd. is a shopping area -- quite famous in Cleveland.  We
are meeting on the corner of Euclid Hts. and Coventry in front of Arabica,
which is a coffee shop.  There are plenty of tables with umbrellas out
front and some cement steps for sitting on next to these.  We'll meet on
these cement steps/seats.

If you know Cleveland, I would take more direct routes, but if you don't
know Cleveland driving, then perhaps try one of these ways:

>From West: 480 East to 271 North to the Cedar/Brainard exit.  Take Cedar
West for a long way until you hit Coventry (look for Warrensville, then
South Taylor, then Lee then Coventry).  Take a right on Coventry for only
about two blocks and you'll see it.

>From East: Take 90 West to 271 South to the Cedar/Brainard exit.  Then
follow the instructions above. 

I hope to see you there.  You can reach me @ 216-921-7649 if you need more
help.

Braden

I'm wondering if we're allowed to bring bags and/or water bottles in 
with us.  Seems like I haven't been able to bring in stuff for a long 
time at Cleveland parties.

Put me down as a "maybe." If I come, I'll be bringing my gf, Jen. Anybody
caught bugging us will be summarily hurt. And if I catch so much as one
sideways glance while we're cuddling, you don't wanna know what I'll do.
Probably throw a mocha shake. ;)

Anyways, it's a maybe. I hafta meet Jen's father tomorrow. *grumble*

one of the funnier rumours i've heard.

he was killed when he managed to electrocute himself messing with some
equipment. 

i'm thinking of spreading a rumour that the tables rebelled against him,
and ate him alive. %)

can someone tell me what it means whe a performer uzes a "live P.A." and how
it is different from a 303?  

i alwaze thot a 303 was a roland keyboard.  but last night i went to a show
where there was only a singer, a guitarist, and some kid piddling on some kind
of knobbie board.  i thot that he was selecting samples stored in memory,
matching the beats and pitches, and looping them in and out.  but i talked to
him afterwards and apparently, no it was all cut in and out by a pre-
programmed d.a.t. and all he did was tweak and filter the bleeps.

Subject: {pb-cle} Splitting time slots for Phunction pass cards?
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

hey guys.  I think I want to just go for the day, on Saturday, for
Phunction, and probably leave before the 8:00 start point (night of
Saturday), for the cheapest entrance rate for the weekend, but I would
still be charged teh $25 for the whole thing from Saturday morning to
Sunday morning, even though I wouldn't be there the whole time ..  And as
from what I know about Phunction, you pay certain amounts of money for a
pass card, depending on when you come in, regardless of how long you'll
stay. . .
Well, I was wondering of the possibility of maybe passing on a pass card to
someone coming to Phunction on Saturday night?  Perhaps we can meet at a
certain time, before the 9:00 $20 rate starts, at a restaurant near the
venue (USA Skating place on ridge)?
If the possibility of splitting up the cost of a entrance pass is feasible,
this would be great. .   i really have no money.  i have no job.
please send along those posts to this thread like frequency of crashes on a
win95 system . .    heheh.

maybe party-throwers should hire decoys to keep the cops bizzy during their
parties?  of course the decoys wouldn't actually be arrested, or else no-one
would take the job, but what if say you kept the local precinct driving around
from one "anonymous tip" to another?  then when the five-ohs show up the
decoys would be all, "here is my proof that i actually live here, officer.
i'm just carrying this stereo around for exercize."  then the boyz in blue
would get another "tip" :P like "attention all units, highschool kids making
out in the park" "free boston cremes at dunkin donuts" etc

it amazez me, the lenghts we go to.  i remember driving home one time from a
happening, thinking ... "it's a shame we had to drive for hours into the
middle of no-where and hide underground, in a filth warehouse basement.  just
to spread luv!"

Once you are heading North on Ridge Rd., you will drive for approximately 5 or

up on your righthand side.  The venue is called the USA Skating Place.  It is
a large white building with blue lettering.  It is located in a plaza along
with a bowling alley and a Dave's Supermarket.  The address is 3475 Ridge Rd.
It is located directly on the corner of Ridge and Denison Ave.  If you get
lost, call us there at 216.281.6901 (only in an emergency).  If you have been
to the venue before, it will seem somewhat unrecognizable due to our extensive
decorations.  There will be plenty of free parking available. 

Doors open at 9 pm.  There will be re-entry from approximately 9 am Saturday
until 9 pm Saturday night.  You will need to take a plastic card with you,
sign out with your name and card number, and bring the card back with you to
check in for re-admittance.  

Hope you have a safe trip.

supposed to have been one last night, but alas, I could not attend.

Uh, I'll be the chick in the big pants.  ;-)

No, seriously -- I'll be the chick with a bright yellow little kid's 
tank top on, and my pants really will be as big as they get.  

--Amanda

OK guys, here's the lowdown on Intergalactic Circus.

The venue:  30 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh
                  BIG!!!!
                  2 rooms
The line-up IN THE ARENA:
                  Richard Humpty Vision
                  Felix da Housecat
                  Atomic Babies
                  Friction&Spice
                  Thomas Michael
                  E-Rock
                  Kevin
                  7-Up
                  Zemo
                  IN THE BALLROOM
                  Dustin
                  Smartie
                  Joshua Ryan
                  Smoov
                  Product 19
                  Ryan Matthew
                  Dave Breakwell
                  XL
                  Ben Matrix
                  Absolut&FrankieG
We're happy to have added more DJs to the line-up.  The venue has one large arena
(the main room) and another banquet area (room 2).  There will be a third
chill-out area with refreshments and vending.
rules&regulations:
              not many.  backpacks welcome. be responsible.  be
              reasonable.  there is no re-entry.  parking will be $3 (out of our
control... the
              space is worth it)
price=$20

That's about it.  Remember it is a birthday celebration.  Be happy, be colorful.
Old-skool rave attire encouraged.

Peace
Kelly&Rich
Downlow

In less than 24 hours, people from all of the midwest and east cost will come
together under one roof to witness some of the world's finest electronic
musicians perform over a period of 36 hours.  Before this can happen, however,
those people need directions on how to get there. ;-)  Here they are...

People are driving in from such places as Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA; Iowa City,
Iowa, New York City; Albany, NY; Toronto, Ont; Chicago, IL; Detroit, MI;
Pittsburgh, PA; and many other cities in the Midwest and East Coast.  
 
Here are the directions from the general areas around these locations.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS:

>From CHICAGO and surrounding areas: Take 80/90 East to 480.  480 East until
you get to the Ridge Rd. exit.  Turn left after the exit.  Follow the specific
directions.

>From DETROIT and surrounding areas: Take 75 South to 280 South to 90 East.  90
East to 480 East.  Get off at the Ridge Rd. exit.  Turn left after the exit.

Pittsburgh, take 79 North to 76).  Take 76 West to Akron.  Get on 77 North.
Take 77 North to 480 West.  Take 480 West to the Ridge Rd. exit.  Turn right

directions.

>From any points other than these, simply find the quickest or closest way to

SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS:

Once you are heading North on Ridge Rd., you will drive for approximately 5 or
6 minutes.  Just after you pass a set of railroad tracks, the venue will come
up on your righthand side.  The venue is called the USA Skating Place.  It is
a large white building with blue lettering.  It is located in a plaza along
with a bowling alley and a Dave's Supermarket.  The address is 3475 Ridge Rd.
It is located directly on the corner of Ridge and Denison Ave.  If you get
lost, call us there at 216.281.6901 (only in an emergency).  If you have been
to the venue before, it will seem somewhat unrecognizable due to our extensive
decorations.  There will be plenty of free parking available. 

Doors open at 9 pm.  There will be re-entry from approximately 9 am Saturday
until 9 pm Saturday night.  You will need to take a plastic card with you,
sign out with your name and card number, and bring the card back with you to
check in for re-admittance.

*puts on Roland hat that he got free*
*puts on Roland t-shirt, also free*
*puts on PhatSponsorPants(tm)*

could you be a little MORE vague?!?!$*)(

there's several 303's.

roland tb-303
roland mc-303
quasimidi rave-o-loution 303, er, wait, that's 309.

the tb-303 is better known as the magic silver acid box. i have several of
them. they're about, oh, maybe a foot long, 2" tall, and 4" deep. the
phatness of the tb-303 is around 43280985329 on a scale of 1 to 10. they
were discontinued over 10 years ago, and mint condition ones go for around
$1000 to over $2000. (no, mine are not for sale)

the tb-303 is an analogue synth, similar to a moog. it has an octave+1 of
range with the keys, and several knobs, including my favourites; rezo!,
accent, and the magic cutoff. it's basically a knob-twiddling device that
owns you so badly it's not funny.

the roland mc-303 is known to most of us tb-303 owners as a frigging hack
that sucks. it's big, it's heavy, and it's NOT a knob-twiddler. the mc-303
is a programmable digital analogue emulation device. it has capacity for a
whole shitload of sample sets, as well as user sets. it's got the same
amount of keys as a tb-303, but it's got less real knobs. basically, you
program it, and you hit play, and maybe screw around with the knobs a bit.
it's about $600 new @ guitar center.

the quasimidi rave-o-loution 309 is a truly strange device. it's an
analogue emulation synthesizer that has limited samples and is only good
as a background or backup rythym device due to it's limitations. that's
why i didn't shell out the $1.1k they want for it at guitar center.

keep twiddlin' those knobs.

If you didn't make it on Friday, you better come tonight or you'll spend
the week reading about how it was the party of the summer secretly
regretting all the while that you missed it!

If you made it last night, you already know what I mean!

BTW, the picnic thang is *on* at 4:00 in Coventry outside of Arabica.

See ya,

     you evil, evil person. you _know_
     you just did that to make certain of
     us very envious.

Hehe. Im never one to get in on the "phat shit" bandwagon. But I got some 
"phat" crosstrainers. Rebok. They were on sale at DICKs sporting goods down 
from 100 to about 60 but my parents bought em for me.  No more dancing 
holes in my boots at parties, now I get to dance in comfort. Woohoo! :)

I never realized how much of a difference crosstrainers could be but just 
breaking them in after I bought them reallly put my feet at rest.  Feels 
like im walking on baloons. All bouncy and springy.  I broke out in dance 
at the store just to see if they would do the trick.  :) And they look cool 
too, funky blue marbled soles, silver lined see hole and black and blue 
waves running all around em. I think im just gunna hang in my room and 
dance tomorrow. :)

for those of you not inclined to write my mom an email making her feel
REALLY BAD, a simple "Please change your mind about letting your son
spin @ that rave." would suffice. go ahead! do it! it'll only take you
30 seconds.

well let me just start off by saying that this was the finest gathering of djs
that i have ever witnessed.  I was a bit dissapointed by the turn out friday
night but it was still dope.....derick may LAID IT DOWN.  Im usually not a
house fan but his hard hittin tracks had me goin nuts....nigel richards
started off siced as hell but mellowed out about half way through the mellow
vibe was continued by terry mullen ....both of these guys had mad skills and
good tracks it was just a few hours too early for what they were playin.
	
	the junglists definately had thing goin on the next afternoon.  Sine started
off dark and evil then moved into some nice jazzy stuff and the to some tracks
of the intelligent nature....then was i think his name was tintonton he was
definately enjoyable he had a cutting style differrent from anything i had
ever seen....then freaky flow with the aide of flipside and some other mcs got
things kinda siced....then 187 brought the house down....though there was only
20 people watching at that point they all went nuts when she dropped bring the
danger and the song that samples sabatoge.  by the time the sweedes went on i
was almost too tired to dance and at abou three i fell asleep on a skee ball
machine but what i heard was definately tight.

	i wanna send a massive shout out to daneille(sleepx2).......thanx a million
for the lodging, chocolate milk, and the yummy frozen treats......i didnt get
a chance to thank you in person but i really appreciate it.
-john

For the record, im doing the same on efnet. :)
I have no intentions of engaging in an irc.server war, its just my server 
of preference and too much of a hastle for me to be on two servers at once. 
 If people actually start hanging out in there I can put a bot up. 
 Theoretically i could put one up on dalnet to and find away to communicate 
them, ill work on that and see what i can find out.  But im not going to 
waste two bots if no one is going to be using these channels :)

I'd be glad to arrange a special space for you guys to meet.  The venue is gigantic so that's a cinch.  Let me know.

WeLL I guess I better do a little weekend review.  
Sorry I missed the net-meet friday night, I ended up getting there REALLY
late.You might have seen me.  I'm pretty tall--bald shaven and I have my
septum and ears pierced.    I didn't get to stay very long on friday.   But I
went in with high expectations and left in high spirits.  I couldn't wait to
get back on saturday!  I put in max effort into all of my work because I knew
what the reward was.  I enjoyed Terry Mullins set, he played a song that
reminded me of muh best friend Little Rhonda from D.C..  Saturday I got there
around 5 or sixish  i missed the Djs name but he played some really good
songs-->SPEED Garage<-- muh favortie(next ta breakz). Then the dj after him
really impressed me with his turntable skillz.   All in all I had a good time.
I met some really nice people: Sean thankz for remembering the chat we had
online!   It was great to meet you.  Chris, wanda, Jade& garth.  Oh and those
to freaky bathr00m girls!!!  I have a bruise on my bumm now....one of'em
pinched the sh*T outta me...er not really, well you know what I mean.  I'm
sorry that I didn't get to meet more of you.  I'm a little--really shy.  But
I''m working on it...
Thankz alot PhryL&short arm.  I had a G00D time.  Maybe by the next party my
legst will be healed.
Moze

     ok, here goes. on saturday evening i drove up
     to cleveland with david (aka xspyboy@aol.com)
     for phunktion. no speeding tickets, which is
     really nice, i don't need those at this point.

     :]

     note: this only applies to the saturday evening
     to sunday morning part of the event. i wish i 
     could have been there for the whole thing, but
     it didn't work out. so disclaimers as necessary.

     first impressions: the door price was bumped 
     up to $25 until midnight (later i hear that 
     this is because of the low turnout). we said
     that we had a printout in our car stating that
     the price would be $20 after 9pm (it was about
     9:45) and the girl just said 'forget it' and
     took our $20s. so much for that. walking into
     the space, it seemed like everybody was sitting
     in the chill-out area spacing while the dance 
     area was dark and empty. the guy spinning (or,
     more properly, sequencing, since that was what
     he was doing) seemed quite good at building
     stuff up and taking it approximately nowhere,
     which was a pity. david holland came on at 10:30
     and after that the music kicked ass (more or less)
     for the rest of the event.

     the space: pretty nice. the sound was so loud 
     it permeated the entire structure, making escape
     rather difficult. re-entry was allowed somewhere
     around 5am, which was really nice. ventilation
     was poor - there was a huge fan, which wasn't by
     a door which rather negated its effectiveness.
     the place was filled with a haze of cigarette and
     manufactured smoke, which for us non-carcinogen-
     addicts was rather painful. i found dancing for
     extended periods difficult simply because i 
     couldn't get enough oxygen in my system. but 
     that's pretty common at parties. since it was
     a roller-skate rink, there was a cluster of arcade
     games. i found the intermittent 'winners don't do
     drugs' messages absolutely hilarious. more on 
     that later. as far as size goes, there was tons 
     of room, and lots of seating, which was nice IMO.

     the lights: nice. there were two lightbeams which
     were doing uninspired logos, and a whole line of
     of heads. my main complaint is that control of
     the lights was random and intermittent. a few well-
     used lights are so much more effective than a whole
     pile of ones that are just left on in various 
     patterns. there was a (un-synced) strobe that was
     only on a couple times. please, someone, get a clue
     and turn off everything but a rear-mounted strobe. 
     the results are totally wild. but... not bad.

     the sound: in a word - hammering. in both the good
     and bad connotations of the word. the SPLs were 
     really high (as we came into the building we could
     hear the roof panels rattling badly) but it sounded
     rather strained at points, like some stage in the
     chain was overdriven, most likely the large drivers
     in the medium cabs. the upper-mid could have been 
     backed off a little, as could the upper-bass. 
     around 8am someone gave me some earplugs (thanks,
     whoever you were) and all of a sudden it sounded 
     really nice. maybe the engineers had plugs in, and
     weren't checking their levels at intervals. anyway,
     it was nice and loud. everybody seemed very happy
     with it. i would guess between 125-130 dB for the
     entire event.

     the music: slamming. but after 8 hours of evil
     madly danceable techno, my feet were kinda hurting.
     :] these guys didn't let up _at all_ from 12am to
     7:30am. at 7:30 baggadonuts came on and spun a
     nice, melodic, varied set that was a wonderful
     change of pace. i wanted to dance to it very badly,
     but ended up inert on the floor after a few 
     frenzied efforts. my entire upper body hurts like
     hell at this point, so i guess you could say i
     enjoyed myself.

     the rest: i was in a very good mood, and was going
     to be happy no matter what. i met a few very nice
     people, aside from everyone at the net-meet (who
     were perfectly wonderful, but i don't remember all
     your names, but random virtual hugs all round anyway).
     annoyances - everyone and his kid brother seemed to
     be pushing. this kid offered me meth like three times
     in a row, and anybody who's seen me knows i'm not 
     _that_ hard to remember. i don't think the vibe was
     too impressive - there wasn't any overt antagonism,
     which for some reason i seem to get, but it was
     also kinda dark. this kid from CMU i met put it well
     when he said 'party is much too cute a word for this'.
     i didn't really mind - i am the guy who thinks that
     metropol has a nice, friendly ambience. i guess getting
     there on the second day meant that a lot of people 
     were stoned/tired/both. 

     so... i give the promoters credit for getting a killer
     lineup in a secluded, legal, clean if not ideal venue.
     security was minimal, which may or may not be to your
     taste. i am certain i would have done some things 
     differently, but in general the party pretty much 
     kicked ass. the music was to my taste, i met cool people,
     and i had a really good time.

     there it is, opinions flavored with objective fact. take
     it for what it's worth. i'm sure other people had other
     experiences.

     bye

hi :)

let's get to it shall we? arrived at the space around oh say 2am friday
nite...


nigel richards was spinning...the sound system was PUMPING :) nigel played
one of the best techno sets i've heard and he had the levels perfect,
work that eq, man...

i was really digging his shit... terry mullan was supposed to play from
12-1:30, but his plane was delayed and he ended up playing after nigel...

so instead of getting to hear nigel til 3 and then derrick may
afterwards...terry went on at 2:30 and played til 4.

terry shouldnt have bothered to get on the plane...

he had several POOR mixes, at lest one or two which were straight up
trainwrecks...the system which was crisp and clear during nigel's set was
suddenly muddy sounding...i really TRIED to dance during his set but terry
kept losing the plot...very frustrating...i know its hard to get off a
plane and spin right away, but for being a professional and getting paid
$1000 to do this shit...i have very little in the way of sympathy...i kept
telling myself...hold tight, derrick may is playing next derrick may is
playing next...it felt like 4am would never roll around but it did and he
delivered :) 

wonderful set...it went from technoey to housey to deeeep soulful stuff...i
loved what i heard, unf. by this time the combination of smoke and beer in
my system was getting the better of me...so the posse
(me/andysine/kate/gill) took off approx. 5am...zzzzzzzzz


next aftnoon, arrived at 2pm...andy was playing another straight up WICKED
set (right tom?)...nice nice nice...(come out to scj tomorrow nite to hear
more smashing business from the one like sine and the dj kaos from
philly)-met up with rudebwoy colby newton, and from that point on the rave
was RUNNIN', beleive.


we brought ridiculous amounts of alcohol to the party sat aftnoon and
proceeded to brock out :) (right tom? ;) it was wicked it felt like a
private rave was being held for me and my close friends :) granted, we
didnt rave as hard as we did last weekend, but thats a good thing i think ;)

titonton came on after andy so we left.

i dunno what we did, dicked around parma, went to best buy and got a zip
drive for the hell of it, and returned it a few hours later...honestly,
things got hazy there for a minute, but i guess titonton only played an
hour so we didnt have to wander too far...came back and steve freaky flow
and flipside were wrecking shop...freaky is badass, one of the top hip hop
jungle djs on the continent. flipside is ok too.

then jordana/187 came on...due to technical problems, she ended up spinning
a set comprised of her own dubplates and some smashing hardstep
business...me and mc mystery (aka black pete from rochester, ny) got on the
mike a bit and the def. highlight for me was when jordana dropped 'dubplate
pressure' (on vinyl syndicate from toronto) the one that has the sample of
mc gq saying 'danger, danger'...personal favorite, i had to call for the
solo rewind on that one, thanks for obliging jordana :) the crowd didnt
seem to mind too much either...sometimes you have to take matters into your
own hands and build up the energy...i don't do it that often, but those
kids need to KNOW that was a wicked track, in case they didnt know the
first time around...

after jordana's set, we (again, kate, gill, colby, and jordana) went to
tommy's...WHERE WERE YOU GUYS ;) haha kidding we didnt get there til oh
8:30 maybe? sooo hungry at that point, tommy's food was perfect, tho my
sandwich did look like a big piece of ass :)

shout outs to viktor, lou, phil, every1 in my crew, melissa c., the
punisher:), and those of you i ran into...sorry i didnt make it back on sat
nite...i was mad tired, hope every1 had a good time...:) (i'll catch up
with you next time amanda)

random thought: i ran into a guy on friday nite who looked really familiar.
i think he is from the list...about 5'5, big dark curly fro, glasses,
wearing a dark shirt...who are you/who is he? i think he's from ohio...if
it's someone i know...sorry mate, i'm getting bad at putting names with
faces anymore...just wanted to say whats up after the fact :)

respect to phyrl and shortarm for the effort involved going into the
event...it didnt go unnoticed/unappreciated, believe.

next ohio madness looks to be the beastie boys/phormation combo...as kate
would say...it's gonna be RUNNIN.


hell yes i want some cheesy poofs,
hossam

Conjunction, junction, what's your phunction?

Overall Impression: I work as a professional event planner and as part of
my job, I get to go to a lot of business and academic conferences.  Every
once in a while, there will be a conference with so many great speakers
one after another that you just get a little dazed.  You forget what a
treat it is to have the talent before you because there's just so much of
it -- that is, until you return and realize from a more objective
perspective that you've just had a life memory!

Well, the exact same thing happened this weekend at Phunction, I believe. 
I mean, a party with just a Nigel Richards or a Derrick May or a Dave
Hollands or a Terry Mullen or an Adam Beyer would have been fantastic. 
But when you have all of these guys and many others I haven't mentioned
(including some wonderful local talent like Titonton, 187 and Product 19,
just to name a few), it can become overwhelming.  Mindboggling.

Now that it's a few days later, the party keeps running through my mind,
and everytime it does, that same smile returns to my face.  I just can't
believe what a great time it was!  There's something about a 2 day party
that adds to the flavor of the experience.  Perhaps it's the stamina you
need to keep going.  Perhaps it's the chance to really spend a lot of
quality time with people you like.  Perhaps it's just having that extra
night to look forward to.  Whatever it is -- I dug it! 

The Set-Up: I especially liked two things about how the room was set up.
For one, the stage was low enough and close enough to the audience that
you could get a very close view of the mixing talent.  In addition, I
liked the arching, overhanging, black plastic that was low enough to walk
under and have your head touch the surface.  It gave you a cool feeling (I
think this was just on Friday).  Then, on Saturday, I liked how they made
some changes so the place appeared like a relatively new space.

The lighting and sound were just fine, at least to my tastes, and the
rolling rink allows for plenty of different areas to sit, lie down and
hang out -- all major pluses for a good party.

The Music: Outstanding!!!  What else can be said other than I hope
mixtapes are available for purchase.

The People: Friday was just terrific.  A whole bunch from this list showed
up for the net meet, and this made a really big difference for me.  I like
the people on this list!  And when they come, I almost always have a great
time.  A quick hello to Steve, Tom Cox, his friend from Pittsburgh, Casey,
Jade (a cutie for sure), StevieT, Amy, Bill, Jay3, Danielle (who I just
missed meeting), and of course Brian and Dave (a party just isn't a party
without this duo on hand). 

Viktor and Lou: Well done, guys!  I know what a bitch it is to have to
work that hard during your own party, but we owe it all to you guys!
Thanks so much for your sacrifice, hard work and excellent taste in music!

Sincerely,

Braden Albert

The Beatles were wrong when they sang, "Money Can't Buy You Love."

It can.

And as I learned this weekend, it costs about $25.  :)

well i'd give a review of friday nite at Phunction but to tell you the truth i
really don't remember much. All i can say is that when i got there (around
10pm) it wasn't all that great. The party really kicked in around midnite when
all the Brits spun. The music was killer, and i actually busted a move (with
help from a little white friend). The best part of the nite for me was being
able to meet some list members. I won't mention names because i'd hate to mix
people up but those who met me know who they are. It's great to put faces to
names. So this is the end of my badly written review, and for all of you who i
met on friday it was great!

Thanks,
Dave

Thanks Kelly !!!
I suppose the usual 2am slot works best , eh?
As to the location of the meet, we leave to you.
Just let us know a good spot inside that would
be easily identifiable to us all, and hold the
15 - (possiblysubphunc27size?) so of us that
actually make it to these.
kewl?

well due to my work being run by the ice cream nazi's, i couldn't come till
saterday, and i had to call in sick, just to do that....

..but anyway...
....i got there around 6pm, after hooking up with my friends, (George
((senecaOH)) glad you could actually go!)   and it was pretty deserted...about
50 people at most and 187 was spinning so i headed strait to the dance
floor...  then after that it was pretty much, dancing and mingling while i was
resting until sunday :)

i'm not sure the names of every dj but i remember a really good house set
followed by a tall, skinny, blonde haired boy...and i finally got to hear lou
:)   

the swedes of course delivered non-relenting sets, as they did last time i
heard them, it was a treat i was looking forward to, ..i danced most the
night, i had to rest alot too, cause i was soo tired, but definatly a great
night, and i liked baggadonuts set, it was definatly i nice conclusion, to a
great night of music

set up::  well, i liked and didn't like the black tarp ...i like it becuase it
defiantly adds a different atmosphere, it was my third time at the Skate
place, so it was interesting to see it that way, but it also tends to make the
venue SO much hotter, and the fans helped, but several times they were turned
off (?)...   and i liked to be able to 'enter the dance floor,....
...but i wasn't to fond of the dj placement , becuase of the size and shape of
the skate place, there was aLOT of room not being used, becuase of hte way it
was placed, (though that may have been different if more people had showed,
which i'm assuming was the purpose for the set up (expectation of more poeple)
actually i'm really surprised at the low turn out...with this line-up!   
..but anyway i also didn't like how when i wanted to check out the dj (whoever
that maybe at the time) i couldn't becuase the crowd already around was to
tight for me to see through, and the only place i could manage to find, was at
the end right next to the speakers, and when i tried to stand there, i was
blasted by the smoke machine (which i'm guessing is the reason there was
actually room there)... i know it can be nice having the dj at your
level...but no one would make room for those of us who were dancing, and just
wanted a peek... though maybe i'm the only one that had that problem...and
later in the morning, it became easier agian, becuase the crowd slowly went
away...it was just a problem i've never had to deal with before...

...i got to meet alot of people, and got to add more faces, to some net names,
i'm not gonna name because i always forget, or mis-match, but i do have to say
hi to Todd (glad you enjoyed your fruit roll up, and to Braden, i've heard
about ya, it was nice to finally meet you too :)  the rest, you know exactly
who you are :)
  
   well, i guess htats all 
from the little pink elephant

I'll make a sign that says something like

Anyone want to bring nametags?  Too cheesy?  Any other ideas?

well now that i'm back and 90% caught up on email, i figured i'd post
up....

if you get the chance to travel west TAKE ROUTE 66.  theres so much cool
shit to see and do on there and i didnt even get to see everything on rt
66 that there is to see.  we stuck to the main route and didnt do alot of
the side trips.
for infos on 66, hit http://route66.netvision.be/ odd thing is the page is
in belgium, but is about an old highway in the us!
arizona is awesome, i might have to apply for jobs out there!   woooo!

i have lots of pics of old buildings and neon signs and all sorts of
stuff.  we took 29 rolls of pics!  its a huge pile of film.  its gonna be
a mess to sort out!

didnt get to see the night life in cali like i'd hoped to coz the ppl we
stayed with were boring and have no life...  i couldnt wander out on my
own coz they went to bed early and didnt want me to wake them up to get
back in the apt.   prolly should've just slept in the car!

oh well......

first of all

kelly--sounds great....and thanx so much

everyone else....look for my top hat....it will hopefully have my name on it....if not...i'll still wear it so i can be spotted. name tags are too hard to read....or notice from a distance....besides...i'm terrible w/names even w/ them and if we don't have them...i'll have an excuse to forget or confuse names...which is inevitable.

hello people with similar intrests:

today is monday and i have been reviewing songs that i really like but
had no name to attach to the song.  some of the songs i have on tape are
mixed fragments; i was always begging for more, extrapolating using the
data i had, but that sucks.  most of these songs come from taping radio
shows (WRCT).  the capture dates of some of these songs date back 2 to 3
years.  i will provide the names of the compressed-but-nice WAV files i
have made in hope that some of you will identify your taste and
ultimately identify the title of the song.  i can mail all of them in a
nifty ZIP bag if you'd like.  begin song list.

[OCD on]

song list (in order of need, projected against the beaufort scale):
#1	ID#ThePefectSound(HardTrance).wav 51.719sec 206KB
#2	ID#AcidHouse.wav 16.242sec 65KB

[OCD off]

did i mention that you can't go wrong if you request these songs and
find that you have never heard the song because...now *you* have them. 
thank you very much.

and another thing...i now own two RdlG tapes.  one specializes in techno
and the other: speed garage (it sounds like jungle that has been
bisected, i don't like it).  the postive aspects of the techno tape
outweigh the negative of the speed garage.  i remember, perhaps, that,
insofaras much that some of you expressed interest in this guy.  i must
say that the techno tape is hard as old-ass fudge or eggs that have been
smeared all over a plate and left to sit overnight in an arctic tundra. 
you get it.  if anyone wants a FREE (oh my dear, wha'd he say?!) copy,
just email me and you will receive further instruction.  the techno tape
is similar to the set emanated at BIZ.

Thanks Kelly I will  post a list Sat/Sun from anyone who wants to email me.

BTW, It seems like Radio Free Carson is off the air currently
but Modern Times on WYEP plays some good diverse electronica Mondays 2am-5am
an ok substitute but it would be nice to hear RFC again.

anyone else know anything about the situation please email as well  :)

Hmm, I got there at about 11:00 and they didn't mention
anything about it being $25, they just took the $20 and
were happy.

I was very disappointed in the music from about the time
I got there to about 5:00 when I left. It was just so damn
repetitive, every once in a while, it would build up to
what should have been something, just to fall back into
the same stuff over and over. Sorry, I like a little music
in with my beats. I was looking forward to hearing Neuromancer
spin, but when I did, I wasn't all that impressed. He was
just mildly better than the guy before him (mind went blank on
his name).

don't smoke at all.

Overall, I had a good time, althought I didn't think the party

bomb! I could have had fun at an insurance convention.

hhrrrmmmm.....my turn, eh? kewl then.....here goes...

The Venue : what can I say about this? We've all been there
and had good times before. This was no different other than
the effective use of black plastic wrap on Fro. vs. Sat. in
creating a different look/mood/feel to the enviroment. Very
kewl.  Personally I didn't care for the location of the tables.
I prefer the middle of the room instead of the end....
subphunc tought me that it could be done very stylee
and makes for a good flow

The system : uuhhhhmmmmm....rocked?  what was it that
someone mentioned about 120-125db's? I need earplugs.
*grin*

The DJ's: Well, I showed up on Fri. just in time for Nigel Richards
and had to bolt soon after Derrick May started his set. And trust
me.... it was all I could do to rip myself away at that point and
head back to work. Phenomenal !!!(sp?)
Returned on Sat. in time for 187 . (phat) enjoyed gettting to
see product19 do his thang and happy to see Lou in the frenzy.
But ....THE SWEDES !!! Christian Smith is .....(well you fill in the
blank, but Thor and Apollo come to mind here, eh?)

The PPL / Vibe : I agree.....being the weekend right after all of
us left everything we had at FA4, there were not enough ppl
for this event. Never the less....as about a hundred ppl were
heard to say... "Damn this party is tight!!"

Vicktor and Lou..... Thanks for the opportunity. I had a blast!!!
Everyone worked very hard to make sure this party stayed
the best it could be. Thanks.  :-)

yes yes ya'll .... don't stop

Steve / D4Pvv3Zz

No complaints from me!! 

#1.It was at my favorite spot. No matter how mant times I have been there, I
don't care..I love that venue!!

I had a teriffic time. I thought the vibe was good...random people were coming
up introduceing themselves, sitting down to talk, asking if I would like to go
dance. One guy even shared some of his art work (graf) and poetry w/ me. I met
some really cool people that night. 

Music: Well let me put it this way...I didn't stop dancing all night. I took
some rest here and there and some water breaks, but other than that it was on
:-) I just couldn't stop myself. I was up by the right speaker most the night,
the louder the better the more smoke the marrier!! 

Anyways I had a really good time. A BIG thanks to Lou and Viktor !

Me too.  I've been to 5 parties there, now, and I've had so many good
memories that it's more than merely a space to me.  It's a good luck
charm.

so at the last minute my friend ben decides that we're going to 
cleveland to see cari lekebusch, adam beyer, joel mull and a ton of 
others on the hybrid/drum code tour.

of course, we left indy late, so we didn't get to cleveland til 2 am.  
ben had been joking that we'd probably get there just as cari took his 
headphones off.  how prophetic...

that's right, we missed cari.  sucks.  i heard he rocked (i have seen 
him play before, so life is not over).

next up was adam beyer.  fuggin shit!!! hard ass, groovin techno played 
by an almost seven foot tall swedish trickster.  double copies and 
backspins to make you swoon (the swedish boys are all REALLY cute...this 
from a dyke, so you KNOW i ain't kiddin).  people were screaming, i was 
jacking.  it was beautiful.  david hollands was dancin like a white boy 
with a grin on his face (if you've ever seen dave dance, you 
understand!)

christian smith (tronic records) went next and brought the tempo down a 
bit.  he still played some tweaky shit.  he dropped tribal storm, which 
is my favorite track at the moment.  i started punching the speaker, i 
was so happy...

but the man of the evening (discounting cari, cause i didn't hear him) 
was definitely mr. joel mull.  i've been snapping up his tracks like 
crazy lately, so i know the boy knows good techno.  but so many times 
i'm disappointed by good producers who can't fuggin spin.  not this 
time, baby!  mull played smooth (sometimes bangin'; sometimes deep) 
techno FLAWLESSLY.  if you like techno, and you have the chance...go see 
this man spin!!!

it was definitely a night of techno geekery.  my friends ben, travis, 
podge, and several others stood in front of the tables most of the night 
with our jaws hanging open.  at one point, ben wondered if the swedes 
knew they were playing predominantly for a crowd of djs :)
the tracks were amazing (mostly white labels, which made trainspotting 
pretty damn difficult...i borrowed ben's flashlight several times to 
spot shit though...the tracks were phenomenal!!!), the skills were top 
notch, and the vibe was slammin...

nice effort by phryl and teknova.  i missed friday night (derrick may) 
and saturday afternoon (sorry i missed you, jordana :(   , but saturday 
night was beautiful.  these guys are teaming up again august 15 for the 
formation records uk tour.  dj ss, john b. (!!!!!), shy fx, and plenty 
more bringin the fuckin drum n bass shiznit!!!  i'll probably check that 
shit, too.

you ever have one of those nights that convinces you that you're on the 
right track?  that's what saturday was.  FA4 was inspiring peoplewise 
(sistas played some pretty nice tunage, too...).  phunction was  
inspiring musically (i'm truly a techno geek...).  i came home and spun 
for 3 hours straight (and i rocked my living room, if i do say so... ;).  
didn't sleep from sat 2:30 pm til sunday 9 pm.  worth every minute...

funny story:  travis actually overheard some raver grrl saying that 
night's music was some of the worst she'd ever heard.  i bet she thinks 
keoki is a good dj too... (sorry...had to say it)

ahhh...techno.  these guys are showing the old school detroit guys 
what's up.  props to detroit, but stockholm is fast becoming the new 
mecca.  

i'm gonna go spin now...

                          shiva

I think I'm the only one who agrees with you (then again, I always agree 
with you), but I thought most of the "music" Saturday night sucked much 
ass -- I tried to dance a few times, but 1. It hurt my ears, and 2. All 
I heard was deafening, distorted bass slamming into my chest.  No melody 
going on at all between 11 and 5 on Saturday night.  I did notice that 
the music got a little better at around 2AM, but just not enough for me 
to get jumping.

Oh, and not that I could have danced much even if I had gotten into the 
music.  At one point I was so hot and felt so sick that I had to beg to 
go outside for a little while.  

I don't like that venue either -- there's nowhere to "escape" the 
noise/music (depending on who's spinning) for two seconds if you have 
to.

(Oh, and while I'm at it, I also don't like guys who feel they need to 
use the girls' restroom and then piss all over the fucking place like 
they're watering some fucking garden.)

I know that smoking is a very, very cool thing for kids to do, but I 
absolutely hate it and when there's no place to go to get away from it 
just slightly (or be downwind anywhere), it contribes to me feeling sick 
and very claustrophobic.

Well, you know how I was feeling most of the time, but my night was made 
better by the same thing yours was.  Funny, maybe we should have gone 
swimming or something instead.  That's always a fun thing to do with 
party favors.

Oh, and I did meet two people from the list, whic is more than I usually 
do 'cause for whatever reason it's always hard for me to find them.  The 
first one I won't mention -- because unless he was tripping out of his 
mind, which I can excuse because Hey --when you're tripping, sometimes 
interacting with people is difficult ... but if not, he was pretty damn 
rude to me.  I met Jade right before I left, though, and she seemed like 
a real sweetie. :-) 

Argh.  I'm really not in a bad mood, although it sure seems like it.  
Just sharing, that's all.  I'm not going to any parties for a month now, 
and I'm going to miss it.  Actually, and unfortunately, it may never be 
the same again for me ... (don't ask)

--Amanda

	A while ago my friend was listening to RFC and told me that the guy who
does it came on the air and said that the FCC gave him a cease and
desist order 'cause he had no license.  He also said that he would fight
it and there was precedent where a pirate station in california managed
to win a case against the fcc and stay open. I presume that's the reason
it's been off the air.  I haven't listened to the station in awhile
mostly b/c I can't get it inside my house.  
	speaking of pirate radio, there's a nice online pirate station out of
london @ http://www.pirate-radio.co.uk  they frequently play good stuff
and it plays well on my 28.8, esp. considering both american servers are
on the west coast.  the only neg. is that it only broadcasts from
6pm-2am UK time, which works out to 1-9 EST.  c'est la vie...

What in the world are you talking about?  Who has a perfect life?  No 
one I have ever known, least of all myself.


>at least its not  like theres a bunch of people shotting each other >or 
people sticking needles in your arm and injecting you with >novacaine 
and then beating you

You're right -- if parties were like this, I wouldn't ever go.  But, 
it's possible to go somewhere and not have a good time even if you don't 
get beaten up and 'injected with novocaine.'

>life is what is meant to be and you just gotta make the best of it
>i thought the party was great and im gonna be real sad if there wont be 
any

Who ever said there shouldn't ever be anymore Phryl parties?  From what 
I have been reading, most people had a blast -- especially Friday night, 
which I'm sorry I missed.  You read WAY too much into me having given an 
honest, personal review of my own, PERSONAL experience at this party.  
Can't I give an honest review like everybody else?  Should I have lied 
and said that I loved everything?

--Amanda

Radio Carson(91.7) is gone for now.  I have been checking it for three 
weeks and it has been off the air.  I am so depressed.  It used to be my 
pick me up before and after work.  It pumped me up before I went out 
clubbing or to raves. Yes, Mark was complaining about people trying to 
shut him off.  They tried to get people to buy t'shirts at Revolution in 
the south side and other places.  They needed more support.  The 
t'shirts they were selling for support were $25 bucks and supposedly 15 
people bought them total at the time.  I really think we should come up 
with another plan to bring Radion Carson back--Don't you think??

hey all,
  i got an old roland s10 sampling keyboard.
it needs medical attention.  the disk drive does
not read disks, 2 or 3 keys do not always make
contact, and it won't transmit midi data.  
  i'll sell it complete with original box (no manual)
for $25 plus shipping.  if you know how to fix
things electrical, it may be a deal for you...

if you are interested, or have any questions about
it, please contact me.

thanks,

>>Is the Left Nuts? (Or is it me?)
>>by Michael Moore
>>
>>
>>Is it me, or is the left completely nuts?  I won't bore you with the
>>details of October's Media and Democracy Congress, but suffice it to 
>say
>>that the left is still in fine form, completely ignoring anything that
>>really matters to the American public.  I'm convinced there's a good
>>number of you who are simply addicted to listening to yourselves talk 
>and
>>talk and talk--Mumia! Pacifica!  Cuba! Enough already! 
>>
>>Speaking of talking to ourselves--just who the hell is reading this?  
>Who
>>is the "Nation" readership?  Is it my brother-in-law, Tony, back in 
>Flint,
>>who last night was installing furnace ducts until 9 o' clock?  Is it 
>the
>>bus driver at the airport who told me he's been cut back to a 
>thrity-hour
>>week so the airport commission won't have to pay the health insurance 
>for
>>his asthmatic daughter?  Is it the woman at Sears who sells blouses by 
>day
>>and then waitresses at Denny's from 8 P.M. to midnight? 
>>
>>No.  The person reading this would probably sympathize with the one 
who
>>wrote the flier I saw at the media congress announcing a "Stop Police
>>Brutality Demonstration."  The flier promised a rally "From 4 P.M. 
>until
>>the truth comes out!"  Until the truth comes out?  Let me tell you,
>>friend, the truth ain't ever coming out to your rally, and neither is 
>Tony
>>the furnace installer, 'cause he's got mouths to feed.  But you don't
>>really want him there anyway, do you?  What you really mean by saying 
>that
>>the demonstration is going to last "until the truth comes out" is that 
>it
>>will go deep into the night, until all self-serving, attention-starved
>>"lefties" have had their hour and fifteen minutes at the podium.  Get 
a
>>clue!  Go away! 
>>
>>Is it true what they say about "the left"--that it loves humanity but
>>loathes people?  I want to let you in on a little secret I've 
>discovered. 
>>"The people" are already way ahead of "the left."  After years of 
being
>>downsized, rightsized, re-engineered and forced to work for longer 
>hours
>>for less pay and fewer benefits, they already know from their personal
>>experience that our economic system is unfair, unjust, and 
>undemocratic. 
>>They know the evil it does and the havoc it wreaks on their lives.  
>They
>>know that corporate America is the enemy, that the media are telling 
>them
>>lies and that the Democrats and the Republicans are actually the same
>>party.  Look at any Gallup poll and you'll see that the public is very
>>"left" on all the issues-- the majority are pro-choice, 
>pro-environment,
>>pro-labor. 
>>
>>Yet they despise liberals.  If they knew where to find the nutty left,
>>they'd despise them, too.  They see liberals, progressives, adn 
lefties 
>as
>>arrogant, self-righteous, and dreadfully predictable.  They know you 
>won't
>>ever go have a beer with them, or talk to them about how the Indians 
>did
>>in the Series.  Christ, can you even name a single Cleveland Indian? 
>>
>>And why should you?  You've got "The Nation" and Pacifica, the food 
>co-op
>>and not supporting Citibank.  But if you stop there and refuse to
>>participate in the real world, how are you ever going to effect 
change? 
>>Back in the eighties, thousands of you went to Nicaragua in Sandinista
>>brigades. Yes, that was important work; our government was killing
>>innocent people.  But i never saw a single one of you come to Flint 
>while
>>the world's largest company was destroying the lives of 30,000 
>families. 
>>Where were you when we needed you?  The people in Flint were 
>ready--Jesse
>>Jackson beat Dukakis by a 9-to-1 margin there.  In the white suburbs,
>>Jackson beat him by a 4-to-1 margin!  You should have come! The right 
>wing
>>did.  They organized the Michigan Militia.  It's no accident that 
Terry
>>Nichols is from the Flint area. 
>>
>>Here's the part i don't get.  Remember the antiwar movement, when we
>>didn't have the American public on our side and actually had to go out 
>and
>>convince people the war was wrong?  That was tough, but we did it.  
>These
>>days, the difficult organizing work has already been done for us by 
Big
>>Business.  It has spent the past decade destroying the middle class 
and
>>brutalizing the poor.  Beating up on the poor, I get--that's the way 
>it's
>>always been.  But the middle class?  What a stupid error in 
>judgment--and
>>now there are millions of Americans waiting to vent their anger and
>>frustration. 
>>
>>And where are we?  Inside New York's Cooper Union chanting for Mumia!  
>I
>>want Mumia to live, I've signed the petitions, I've helped pay for the
>>ads--hell, I'll personally go and kick the butt of the governor of
>>Pennsylvania!  But, for chrissakes, the woman working at Sears just 
>wants
>>to be able to spend an hour with her kids before she heads off to 
>Denny's. 
>>Can't we help her?  Do you WANT to help her? 
>>
>>It's taken me a while to figure it all out, and after last month's 
>Media
>>and Democracy Congress I think I have the answer:  because "the left" 
>has
>>lost so many battles, it now doesn't know how to live any other way.  
>It's
>>kind of scary, isn't it, to think that we could actually reach a mass
>>audience.  Or that after all these years of failure, real change could
>>actually occur in our lifetime.  Better to fight among ourselves!  
It's 
>an
>>uncomfortable, unfamiliar feeling, isn't it, to get a whiff of a real
>>populist progressive movement taking shape.  Better that we keep those
>>furnace installers and bus drivers away from us--they don't read 
>Chomsky
>>anyway! 
>>
>>The signs are everywhere, but "the left" can't read a road map.  
>There's a
>>whole New Politics taking place, and it's being led by U.P.S. drivers 
>and
>>Borders bookstore workesr.  I say, with all due affection and 
>appreciation
>>for all of you and your causes, get over yourselves, start talking 
like 
>a
>>real person, then start talking to real people.  You could begin by
>>hitting 0 every time you get a robot when you call 411.  Have a chat 
>with
>>the human operator--the phone company will eventually have to hire 
more 
>of
>>them.  Or sponsor a bowling team and put the name of your local Labor
>>Party or environmental group on their shirts.  Or try bowling 
yourself.

getting

exactly.....i mean, im not saying i know everything, but i know what is 
being played at a party before i go.....it doesnt mean i wont have a 
good time if theres no techno, hardcore, or jungle (my favorites) but i 
know not to expect to be blown away by random house dj's....

how many of you guys find out before a rave what styles the dj's have?

i wanna know, cuz it just doesnt seem like the raving masses even 
care.....
yadda, yadda, yadda

well, lets say that this is far and away the most talent ive seen 
squeezed into such a small amount of time.....music wise, it was some of 
the best ive ever heard.....

friday:nigel richards started out fierce, then kinda died down ...terry 
mullan=blah, boring
derrick may:holy shit, he blew me away....i cant say enough good things 
bout him, he's the fucking man.....best dj ive seen, hands down...
saturday (daytime): poor turnout for an awesome jungle lineup...guess 
not too many people are into both techno and jungle, eh?
sine: good form as always....rockin out hard with some bambataa bizniss 
and some "this is l.a."
titonton: this guy was fuckin great....too bad i had to get some sleep 
during him...i still thought he was awesome though...
freaky flow and mc flipside and the other mc guys:
f.f. had tight mixing, good tracks (still loving "man of steel")but i 
hate boring scratching over jump-up.....the mc had to ask for 
appreciation:thats a sign that no one cares.......i think everyone 
should take their scratch records and throw them out....they are useful 
for learning techniques, but are still just bad sounding to me...i hate 
them......nice juggling with the two tracks that said "freaky flow" 
though....he fucked that up a few times, but it still sounded 
cool...flipside was good.....the other white guy sucked....the other guy 
was good.....
1.8.7. well, return of shaft and the sabotouge song are two of my 
favorite jungle songs right now, and miss 1.8.7. also dropped some stuff 
by dj zinc, my second favorite producer (only second to 1.8.7.) so i 
liked this set alot.....lots o' dubplate bizness....it got me even more 
exoted for her set with d.cypol @ life is but a dream..
product 19: i love the guy, and i love the stuff he spins...acid lines 
make me ejaculate
the german guy: i liked his tricks, and his tracks...though definitely 
not my favorite set of the night......

saturday night: 
circutry: not bad, though it was the first time i ever saw a live act 
trainwreck;) other wise pretty nice hard techno
the swedes: cant remember all of their names, but i fuckin love these 
guys........they just wouldnt let up at all...kept it hard, and 
satisfyed my need for some swedish techno......i really love the 
stuff.......
baggadonuts: brought it down nice and proper

all in all a great fuckin party.....those phryl and shortarm kids really 
book some great fuckin dj's, and they throw some awesome parties...ill 
be @ the formation world cup tour and any other events that i can get 
to...big up victor, phil, and lou......

also, net shout outs to braden(extreme paranoia:), steve, danielle 
(thanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanks:),canada69, 
casey, hossam, and everyone else i forgot (my memory sucks:)
non net geek shouts to my boy shawn from pure/tr generation, vinnie from 
pittsburgh, sine, the other danielle i met, mike and mike from fame 
records, and everyone else i forgot:)

peace, 
toM

In a message dated 98-07-15 04:22:33 EDT, you write:

<< .it doesnt mean i wont have a 
 good time if theres no techno, hardcore, or jungle (my favorites) but i 
 know not to expect to be blown away by random house dj's....
  >>

but then again, isn't it just so refreshing when you *are* blwon away by
someone you weren't previously familiar with? This happened to me not too long
ago when I happened to stumble into a room where DJ Bone was spinning. Since I
generally don't keep up much with the Detriot scene, I was unfamiliar with
this guy, but thank goodness my sense of direction is bad and I wandered in
that room. This guy was *tearing* shit up. Trance like I had *never* heard!
Phenomenal. If you haven't checked this guy out, it's a must...whether you dig
the "catagory" of music he is classified under or not ;)

ps-I'm not dead, but plan on dying.  Since you only die once (unless you're
one of those reincarnation heads) it seems like that's a good thing to plan
for.  (for those who know me and my suicide plans, don't worry, I stll don't
intend on carrying them out for another couple decades...it helps that I'm not
a psycho.)

and the rave phenomenon seems to be wearing off on me (raves no longer excite
me much,)  
has this happenned to any of you guys?  could be for me a phase or permanent;
I don't know.
iT means if this keeps up no igc or libad for me (that would be a waste at
this point)

For those of you who have no clue what IRC is, at the end of this post I
will give a brief explanation.   I know most of you probably understand it,
and even use it -- however I know for a fact that many of you don't.


>I have founded a new IRC channel in DALnet called #Pb-Cle_raves
>
>I am looking for some people to be ops in this channel.


I must say that I think #pb-cle-raves is more appropriate than
#pb-cle_raves, as it would be nice to keep the same consistency that the
newsgroup has.  I will add two of my bots (Moonshine & Everclear) to Efnet
#pb-cle-raves.   I will eventually make them fun, but don't have the time to
devote right now.  My IRC nick is TymezUp, so if you wish to be added to the
bots, just ask me.   I would think that anyone subscribed to the list would
not be into  the takeover thing, so just ask to be added to the bots.  They
bots are also linked with the #rave bots.


Now, a bit about IRC (Internet Relay Chat).  IRC is way of chatting through
the internet, free of aol chatrooms, hotline, instant messengers, etc.  IRC
is composed of many inter-connected "servers".  The servers exchange
information and chat.   You (as a chatter) need a "client" (program) to
connect to a server.  Many different clients are available, depending on the
platform (mac, *nix, windows) you use.   I don't know much about macs, but I
know there is a client called ircle for you.  For windows, mIRC is pretty
much the standard, but pIRCh is my client of choice.  I like pirch because
it has a better GUI (graphical interface) and it is easier to use.

Pirch can be downloaded here: http://www.bcpl.lib.md.us/~frappa/pirch.html
and mirc can be downloaded here:
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/6000/

Now that you know a bit about IRC, you need to understand that there are
different networks.   Dalnet, Efnet, Undernet, IRCnet, etc.   There are
litteraly over a 1000 different IRC servers, but you have to use one on the
network your friends are using.   Efnet is the most popular widely used
network.   There are over 10,000 people connected at one time through over
30 different servers.  How do you find a server, you may ask.   This was one
of the problems I had as an IRC newbie.   I have since created a fairly
popular webpage that updates the Efnet server list every four hours.  It can
be found at http://www.erienet.net/~circle/links.html  For additional
information, you can check out http://www.irchelp.org/ or you can check out
the IRC section of my personal web site http://www.cybrtown.com/~burky

There were two things that plauged me as a beginning IRC user.   One was the
use of IDENT, and the other was lag.

If you see a message about INSTALL IDENT, that simply means you need to
enable that feature in your pirch or mirc client.   Its a way of the server
to determine the "name" of your computer.   It is in you best interest to
make your IDENT something obscure.

Lag.   With a network such as Efnet, it takes awhile for information to get
from here to there.   Usually the lag is around 2 seconds.   However,
servers do have problems, and tend to split or get lagged.  You can PING
another user to determine your lag.  If you join a channel and don't see
what your expecting, then the server you are using is probably "split".  A
split is a seperation from the rest of the network.

I hope this information wasn't too technical or anything.  IRC is a fun
place... and you never know who your going to meet there ;)

OK, I saw a flyer last night at SCJ (which rocked BTW) for an event
called Bitch get the Smack Down (or something really close to that). 
Now all you people who were complaining so hardcore about the RUMOR
that rachel was going to throw an event w/ a similar name really need
to check this flyer out.

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, i'd like some feedback on this?

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

  the sound throughout the night will have both balance and progression,
  so you can always choose between two styles, or experience a flow of
  sound (dub-dancehall-jungle-hardcore-techno-trance-house).  There will
  definitely be some music you don't hear at every rave - both slow and
  fast tempos - but it will all be good.

  including toy prizes, free fruit, face painting, as well as other drinks
  (not alcohol) candy and water ($1) will be for sale.

  (more is better) people in your vehicle.  we'll also be setting up some
  kind of carpool or shuttle.  leave a message on our line or email us
  (pbsproductions@hotmail.com) if you're interested in this.

  one thing we want to let everyone know: this event is about nothing more
  than having a good time, and grooving to the music!  have phun, but
  be responsible.  this music and culture are special -  we don't want it
  commodified and sold as a product. please respect the space and
  don't tag. don't bring drugs, weapons or ill attitudes.
  thanks to all the folks who've helped us this far - you're great!

  If you have any questions or comments,
   email us: pbsproductions@hotmail.com,

By the way, its "Bitches Get The Smackdown".  This was a running joke
this weekend for me.  Whenever I was feeling sad, bored, or tired I just
started repeating "Bitches Get The Smackdown.  Bitches Get The
Smackdown.  Bitches Get The Smackdown!"

It's ironic how this flyer touts respect for people of all gender, ethnicity,
race, and sexual orientation, yet the "bitch" getting the "smack down" is in
drag.


Hmmmm...

Hi,
  I met some heads during Lemon Lyman's set @ FA, who I believe were
from Columbus.  They let a ni...I mean a white brother know that if I
wanted to get down with their click, that I should come by the
campsite with the Lion of Judah flying high in the sky overhead.  But
when I tried to represent there the next day, but dem  all were
spaceghost !?  
   Now I'm just a country boy  from the hills of Virginee who learned
how to do that crazy spin move where you catch the glowstick mid-turn
while runnin shine with my paw, but damn if anyone can give me the
4-1-1 on how to hook up with L double  or his possee (are they called
Underground Columbus?), I'd be hella thankful.

i am of the firm oppinion that they should have left the explanation out....it
would have been alot funnier the other way it seems too many times people take
away from a good time just not to offend people....in my oppion people should
learn how to take a joke.

Im talking with advisor (the guys who handle CMU's bboards) about getting 
pbcle routed through to a proper gatewayed bboard.

Soo, graffiti.raves wont be subscribed anymore but a new one will be 
(probably listserv.<something>).
But you wont have to subscribe/post/unsubscribe anymore.  Supposedly.

Just warning you guys. Im doing this for two reasons. One is that trouts 
been having a hard time with cmu students who dont understand you have to 
be subscribed to post. The other is convenience so people dont have to do 
the sub/post/unsub trick.

As for you trout, im sure you will be a bit happier :) Please when the 
requests to sub the board and unsub the old board come through, approve 
them. I asked them to cc me when they do this so I can remind you if need 
be.

Thanx a mil.

I've uncovered a technique I'd like to share with everyone.  As some of
you know, there are certain undesirable after-"e"-ffects that come with
the consumption of xtc.  For one, and this usually hits me 3 days after
the fact, there is a sense of complete exhaustion and depression.  Well,
the cause is the depletion of seratonin.

It's like having a bar of soap that's practically used up.  It's really
hard to get a good lather going when there's only a sliver left.  But
don't worry, the bars of soap in our brains do replenish themselves.
Science tells us that it takes 2-4 weeks to fully "recover".  This is
probably true no matter what you do, but I've found something that can at
least mollify the harsh side-effects.

1) When you feel the exhaustion coming on (and I'm assuming here that
you've already gotten enough sleep in the prior days to have fully
recovered from the true exhaustion of dancing all night), don't give in to
it.  It's not true tiredness that you're feeling here.  It's the
depression associated with lower than normal levels of seratonin.  You
haven't felt this for 2-4 days yet because the body has been in shock,
still working overtime to accomodate the rush.  If you sleep too much at
this point, you're only going to make things worse for yourself.  Keep to
a regular schedule.  If you sleep 8 hours a night customarily, then
continue to do so regardless of what your body is telling you to do.  If
you simply must, take a half hour nap, but don't do much more than this.

2) Aim for natural peaks.  Do you ever get "goosebumps" from listening to
a certain song or imagining yourself winning a gold medal or from just
exercising?  You should try to get this feeling several times a day during
your "e-blues".  This is what will accelerate the seratonin replenishment.
Get those goosebumps pumping every two hours and call me in the morning.

3) Take time out to smell the roses.  Spend at least 2 hours a day during
this period going through positive memories.  Look at photo albums of old
friends and the great times that you had with them.  Call people you love
on the phone, especially those who you haven't talked to in a long while,
and chat for a while.  This is a good one -- smell the kinds of smells
that evoke wonderful memories from the past.  Is there a certain incense,
perfume or cologne that brings back a golden time for you? The more you
can tap into the well of positive emotion, the faster the recovery will
be. 

4) Vicarious penmanship.  Sit down and write out a detailed account of
your latest e-xperience.  As you get to the peak, try to unravel exactly
how you felt.  By going through this on paper or on keyboard, you'll find
yourself getting very excited and enormously happy.  You might want to
jump around a little.  This is the very thing that will recharge the joy
juices and get the seratonin straight.

I did all four of these "by accident" yesterday as I was searching for a
way to get back to normal.  And today, I'm pretty much there.

Give them a try when you feel the need to do so and e-mail me how it works
for you.

Sincerely,

Braden

i have never really given my body the full time to recover from an *e*
experience, so i'm starting to forget what it feels like to be normal. 
i have just today started to experience yucky depression and lethargy. i don't
like it at all. sometimes i wonder if one great night is worth a few terrible
days. i can get through the way i'm feeling right now by telling myself that
it won't last forever. i'm excited to stop doing e for a while. i think my
body needs a break.
i do seem to be having a real problem with what i would think is meth
withdrawal. i have read a million times that there aren't really any physical
addictions to meth, but i can't believe that because everytime i stop doing
meth, after about the second day, i become violently ill. i want to stop using
it so badly, but can hardly handle not being able to hold my head up or walk
around my house. has anyone esle ever experienced this with? i'm beginning to
realize that i truly think drugs are evil.
i can almost bet that someone is going to reply to this with some *you created
this problem for yourself. why are you so dumb?* reponse. well, here's what i
have to say...i know drugs are best in moderation, but sometimes that
moderation becomes and more and more and you realize you're headed for
trouble. i've gotten to that point. i don't need your criticism today. save it
for someone that doesn't have a problem yet.

Oh, well, meth IS physically addictive, and when you are addicted to it 
and try to stop, you get withdrawl symptoms.  You're not imagining this 
-- it is really happening.  I wonder where you've read that it's not 
physically addictive, though, since I never have. 


 i want to stop using
>it so badly, but can hardly handle not being able to hold my head up or 
walk
>around my house. has anyone esle ever experienced this with? i'm

>realize that i truly think drugs are evil.

No, drugs are not evil in and of themselves.  Misuse and/or abuse of 
them can do 'evil' things your body, your well-being, or your lifestyle, 
though.  Meth can be very dangerous stuff.  If you use it once in 
awhile, you're probably going to be all right, since this is the case 
with most things.  However it can be very addicting, and in really 
extreme cases some abusers can develop 'amphetamine psychosis.'
Actually, I consider meth to be one of the worst drugs with one of the 
highest potentials for abuse.  However, there are other drugs which I 
consider to be quite 'safe' in comparison, when used responsibly.  Why 
don't you just stick to MDMA, which is not physically addictive?


>i can almost bet that someone is going to reply to this with some *you 
created
>this problem for yourself. why are you so dumb?* 

If anyone says this to you, they're being an asshole.  You are being 
incredibly honest.  Besides, it's really no one else's business anyway.

Take care,
Amanda

on the psychoactive advice tip, here's a li'l discussion with
someone quite recently concerning lsd...perhaps someone 
else out there may find it informative...

[edited version 1.0]

G: omg...my friend accidently gave me a hit of straight strick 9 
and all i  got was a backache so my other firend gave me the same
stuff i had the night before
G: so what happened was it made me trip too hard from the strict 9 
and i almost died i guess
G: more or less i tripped so hard i couldnt move hardly and it took 
50 seconds to move for 5 minutes then 49 then 48 for reactions and 
stuff all the way to regular
T: what do u mean u almost died?
G: i was dead from everything from 1130pm to 5am
G: all i did was lay there and everything went so slow
G: the timeing on the music was 50 bpm to slow for part of the time 
and slower and faster etc..
T: are u sure u weren't on k?
G: im sure
G: it was way worse then a khole too
T: well 1st of all it's a figure of speech when kids say there's 
strichnine in acid (cuz there isn't)...just like how sum ignant kids 
say there's smack in e...it's a figure of speech
T: was it a gel cap?
G: i know..but i mean it was actually strict9 on it
G: no it was paper
G: i dont do gels 
T: was it like triple dip blotter?
G: kinda..but i knew it was bad right wheen i had the back pain 
but i thoguth it was just real shitty
T: i dosed last night also...but it was very clean...very slo build up
...minimal hallucinations...but not speedy enuff for me
G: ahh i see
G: i couldnt stop goin faster
G: remember when i came up to u and * when u were sitting on
the wall?
T: yes
G: well thats like when it started
G: thats why i was all weird
G: i was goin  too fast...id like walk into people and i thought i was 
already past them
G: my mind was running and running
G: and then everything went blah! and i couldnt do anything
G: so some guy helped me out for awhile and i really thank him
then my firneds chilled with me and sat there to make sure i was ok 
G: it took all the way to 5am for me to know anything
G: all i remember is hearing all these people around me saying i
was dieing and all this other shit
T: i had very deep thoughts...mostly spiritual...prophecies...the 
apocalypse...the scenes part in the future...particle physics theory...
vibration theory...big bang theory...yin yang tie in...behold a pale horse tie
in...illuminati tie in...demolitian man future theory...fractal/catalyst
theory...progressive socialist theory...critical mass from the extremes of
capitalism...reality is relative theory...etc etc
G: wow thats crazy
G: im just glad i made it throught hat bad trip
T: u control yur thoughts...obviously yur biggest fear at the time 
was fear of death...mostly thru overdose...the most important 
question u should have asked yurself was why am i so afraid of od'ing?
...what can i do to prevent this from happening?
G: and i got bunk k the night before it was the shit the guy died 
with at family affiar but i only had 1 bump so i was ok but it still 
freaked me out..my friend went into a k hole from it
G: yea i was
G: the real thing i was afraid of was everything breaking
G: dieing was just cuz people were saying shit
G: i made it through saying yea everythigns all good just watch the 
lights ill be fine ok ill be fine ahh thats it im getting better
T: this is what u most overcome...yur paranoia...believe u me...this is 
a very difficult thing to have...self confidence...i'm not completely 
confident all the time myself...especially @ partys...but u must ask 
yurself why u feel this way...and deal w/ it accordingly
G: yea..most defiinitly
G: bad trips are terrible
T: i can tell u straight off the bat...confidence comes when 
u make more friends in the scene...when yur with a group of 
friends you feel comfortable with...they will keep up yur vibe
G: the amoutn i had wasnt that much either but whatever the 
first thign i had was more then enough for anyone but it needed 
to be kicked in with sumthing else
G: hell yea..thats what ahppened
T: an important thing to remember is that a trip is very much 
like dreaming while awake...u can control yur dreams...so u can 
control yur trip
G: yea
G: only thing was..the trip was so intense i really couldnt  
control what i did during it but it was so strong i couldnt 
keep up...the way it all went was the bpm of the music was 
way slower and moved up every 5 minutes til it was perfect 
and my movement the same it was real weird
G: after i was out of the bad trip i realized that it was actually 
the greatest trip anyone could ever have just itd be nice to not 
have the dead part first
T: next time trip w/ a group of friends you can trust, i suggest a 
co-pilot that will remain sober & assist you if u feel yur havin a 
bad trip & talk u out of it...u can even discuss what a good trip 
would be before tripping and attempt to execute it after dosing
G: yea thats what happened
G: but see i know sum1 else that had the one dose i had and the 
same thing hapepned to them jsut off of it for an hour
G: but just not as bad cuz they didnt have anything else
T: acid is definitly one of the strongest drugs out there...it can effect 
yur state of mind for quite some time...it can totally change yur view 
on life...hopefully in the end into something a bit more positive...
T: next time concentrate on extrospection as opposed to introspection
G: yea
T: you can take it to a whole new level...i believe some of the most 
creative theorys in art & life were lsd induced...just learn to control 
the drug instead of the drug controlling you
G:yep
T: i dont mean that in a capitalistic way...i mean that in a mind 
expanding way...but for now concentrate on getting reality straight 
before taking the next step and exploring surreality
G: yea i hear ya there
T: dont over exert yurself...you maybe trying to go too fast too 
soon....don't burn yurself out
T: things work alot better once you have control over yur life...
many times drugs just seem to complicate it more when yur not 
ready for it yet

for those that remember the man, the legend, grandpa techno, one of
the pioneers of the cleveland underground scene (and the one who
inspired myself and countless others into dj'ing hardcore techno),
Scott Forbush has been diagnosed with cancer...

igroove@cyberdrive.net sed:


<<Well, to keep it brief, he found out about it around Christmas, went in

for surgery to remove as much as they could about February.  That went

well, and when I last spoke with him (2 - 2.5 months ago) he was doing

well, and didn't need chemo, just some radiation therapy.  Then out of the

blue, Earl phoned me and told me his condition had worsened.  So far, I

haven't been able to get a hold of him for any update.  Last check, he had

most of his right lung removed, some muscle mass on his right arm was

also removed, his right shoulderblade is gone, so are a few ribs, and he 
had a pin in his spine to prevent turning of his head (for healing purposes, 
I suppose.) He was wacked on pain killers so I didn't get to talk to him :(  
Peeps have been sending him cards, and some are doing what they can.>>

You can reach him:

Scott Forbush c/o Earl Francis

No no no.  I mean Yes -- for Prozac to work as an antidepressant -- yes 
you have to do it for a couple weeks for it to work.  But, what I'm 
talking about is something completely different.

Prozac works in the same way E does -- it causes a release of serotonin 
and inhibits re-uptake.  Now when you take E, you get a  huge surge of 
serotonin all at once ... and if you take a couple Prozacs afterwards it 
traps the serotonin  -- doesn't let the levels  deplete so quickly. 

It is also thought that Prozac will counteract any possible 
neurotoxicity from the E, which is a definite plus for those concerned.  
(Come to think of it, DXM, or rather the chemical to which it is 
metabolized, will do the same thing as far as counteracting the 
neurotoxicity of E).  

Anway, as far as taking Prozac with or after E -- people actually do 
this, and it does work -- in fact, according to stats on the Web, taking 
three or four Prozacs up to a couple days after E-ing is becoming quite 
"trendy."  Sure, you have to know someone with a prescription, but how 
hard is that really in this golden age of Happy Happy Joy Joy?

(Quick Prozac trivia:  The place where the most Prozac in the world is 
prescribed?  Wenachee, Washington).

i know that meth is extremely extremely addictive, but the effects are
mental...not shaking, tremors, constant throwing up, etc. like you might find
with heroin.

one thing that a week ago was missing for me was intellectual stimulation.
well, i found a way to coax it out of whoever i wanted.  

sure, those posts about me not having much fun were based on reality, but i
must admit that i juiced them up a bit to inspire reaction.  if you talked
with me in person at all the last couple of days you probably noticed that
emotionally speaking, I ain't do THAT bad.  in fact, i'm doing quite good and
getting better.  it just so happenned that i wasn't doing excessively
terriffically wonderful like i had been for about 3 months at least.  

the nice part is that i pried some good thoughts out of many people,
rediscovered that friends really can be counted on, made some money, and
worked up a wonderful desire for a jelly doughnut.

so, the bottom line is, the crazy is almost back in seth baum.  [i felt
goosebumps as i wrote that last line, definately a good sign]  if you're going
to igc or libad, LOOK OUT!!!  i might smack your bitch ass down with some
ultra-hype monosodium glucose [in a good way]

seth[well, not yet, but almost]baum

ps-with good moods comes christmas spirit!  i shall aquire what tom "cox"
calls "mouth candy"  [not anal candy]  and disperse it with a smile and the
craziness you all have grown to love

pps-it's christmas time in the city! i'll hive more details later.

ppps-anyone wanna give me a ride home or somewhere else real late sun morn
towards end of igc?

i personally have never done meth, but my (stupid-ass) friend found
himself in the same situation you are. there is definitely physical
addiction to meth. he really wanted to quit, because he was the only
person aware of his use and felt shady for not telling his friends,
and realized it was hard-core fuckin' with his head. he says the only
way to do it is jusut to stop. he spent nites lying in bed with
absolutly no sleep, sweating in a cold room wearing nothing, but
that's the price you have to pay for your addiction, i guess. take a
few days off work (like a monday and friday) and stop!! just dont take
any more. once you have dealt with the situation, it'll be over. i
feel really really bad for you, though, because it is going to be a
very hard couple of days, but you CAN do it.

> i'm beginning to realize that i truly think drugs are evil.

nope... not all drugs, just some. well, most if you use em
incorrectly, but some are a hell of a lot easier to keep under
control. here's a tip that will do just about everyone some good:

                  DONT SNORT SHIT UP YOUR NOSE!

while i'm on the subject of "The Garden", in case anyone is interested, they posted on the site that Rabbit in the Moon is coming to "The Garden" on aug 19....just in case anyone is interested in this show....it's on the site that kelly and trout gave for the direx for circus.... www.mvid.com look under the garden and events...

anyway...keep the info flow going.

Hey_You

fast tempos - but it will all be good.

including toy prizes, free fruit, face painting, as well as other drinks

kind of carpool or shuttle. leave a message on our line or email us

than having a good time, and grooving to the music! have phun, but
be responsible. this music and culture are special - we don't want it
commodified and sold as a product. please respect the space and
don't tag. don't bring drugs, weapons or ill attitudes.
thanks to all the folks who've helped us this far - you're great!

No.  Prozac is NOT an monoamine oxidase inhibitor.  It is an SSRI.  The 
only problem with being on Prozac (all the time; not what I was talking 
about earlier) is since it does the same thing to your brain as E, 
taking E might not have much effect because of cross-tolerance.
I DID my research.  Oh, but what you say about MAOI's is true -- Prozac 
just isn't one of them.

>for anyone considering taking prozac semi-recreationally (as a tonic 
for

caffeine.

Listen to your body, mate! e is very hard on your immune system and the
depression and lethargy are way worse if you do it several days in a row
or even weekends in a row. it is a pretty wonderful experience if you
can bring yourself to only do it about once a month or less often. Not
to mention where are you getting all this money??

AS some one else already posted, you definitely CAN get addicted to
Meth. Meth withdrawal can put you through terrible cold sweats, nausea,
body aches like the worst flu you've ever had, and who knows what all.
That's just what I found out watching a friend go through it. He got the
meth unknowingly in e he was taking. No wonder he wanted to take it
every day! 

Good luck! GEt clean and then try getting high on the music and life!

Actually, my friend who was addicted to meth experienced shaking
tremors, puking, just like heroin. Alcoholics also experience similar
withdrawal symptoms. There may be mental side effect, too, but my friend
did not experience them.

In addition to all these great things that Braden mentioned, I would
highly suggest taking large amount of vitamins.  Like "Mega Man 2000"
and shit.  They are loaded with all the chemicals that your body needs
to replenish that good shit in your brain.  I did this a while back
and found that it helps a lot.  I think it also helps with the "I've
been smoking way too much bud" blues.

look, i'm only gonna fucking say this once. anybody who fucks up with
prozac, it's your own fucking fault.

as if you couldn't tell ALREADY, i don't like prozac. the shit is
literally deadly, and that's in perscription doses. 

i was on prozac for about a week when it first went public. it's the most
dangerous shit i have ever done. it's deadlier than cocaine, it's deadlier
than cigarettes, it's deadlier than fucking meth and e combined. about,
what, 3 or so years ago, i was finally diagnosed with cfs[1], so i've been
off all that kinda shit for close to 4 years. (i said 'fuck it, this isn't
helping, it's making me worse. screw you.' to the idiot shrinks)

anyways, back on topic. prozac is deadly because of the way it interacts
with the chemicals in your brain. no, prozac won't kill you, probably not
even if you od. however, some of us (probably a very low percentage) have
extremely adverse reactions to prozac. namely, it does the exact opposite
of what it's supposed to.

prozac is a 'mood stabilizer.' it's supposed to even out the chemical
levels in your brain, preventing mood swings and supposedly bringing you
out of depression[2]. 

if you've never done prozac before, then you'd better be fucking careful.
and i'm dead serious. in some people, it has the exact opposite effect,
intensifying the most prevalent mood more than 100 times it's original
effect. if you don't believe me, i'll be glad to show you the scars from
when i was on prozac for about 3 days. 

so in short; be fucking careful. and if you have cfs[3], i personally
recommend staying well the fuck away from prozac. due to the way cfs
works, it won't have much of an effect anyways.

[1] chronic fatigue syndrome
[2] which is a load of shit. what prozac will do is dull down moods, in
    some cases to the point where you can't tell happy from sad. it
    doesn't cure, or even do much of anything for depression. 
[3] fyi; my health is really bad, and as my pcp puts it, 'your body may
    look and act it outside, but i don't think anybody's even similar to 
    you internally'

pirate eye-patch from the halloween kit. I do want pirate 
style but with it made outta cloth, thats not asking too much
is it. So any suggestions on where to find one just let me know.
If I need to pop out my neighbors left eye just to get a good
cloth eye-patch i'm seriously willing, but that will be a last 
resort type of situation. My own eye is not yet in the equation 
either. So as you can see im really desperate. Any help wold be

some homework ppl  ....    strychnine is not put in this stuff, nor is it a
byproduct or ingredient in any of the recipies for it---the information is
out there   i didnt bother reading it much beyond that, usually as soon as
someone mentions strychnine or rat poison in regards to this stuff they
have no concept of what they're dealing with and quite simply thats bad.

i was just thinking.  since the infoline says that you should dress
intergalactically, i think we should represent our local galaxies.  you
know, have like half the people from the list dress like their from the
Andromeda Galaxy and the other half from the Milky Way.  we can have our
respective intercircus-rave customs going on and it will be pure
fun...oh, come on...don't look at me like that.  we can pretend like we
are not aware of the customs of the other galaxies and be amazed as we
teach ourselves new things.  i will be representing ANDROMEDA because if
you break it down to its greek parts it means male median -- and that's
just what i am....the normalest male you'll ever encounter =]

<< Thos really isn't an option for anyone because you have to be on Prozac a

not only that, but Prozac is *also* a seratonin enhancer (obviously a much
milder one) , which would appear to defeat the purpose of attempting to get
through the withdrawl of one seratonin enhancer by substituting it with
another one.

hi kids, i know i've been quiet lately but i really haven't had much to say.
until now.

phunktion was the bomb.  that's all i really have to say about that.

and atomic ... well.  the 412 finally has a weekly all-ages (?) event.  oh i
went to steelcityjungle a couple weeks ago and it was fresh again, i can't
forget about that.  but anyways, pittsburgh really needs a venue like this
where kids can find a dependable, clean, safe, party ... even if it stops at
2.  i'd like to see atomic ultimately attract a perkier crowd by maybe booking
some big name dj's and using the lounge.  oh and anyone who can invest a
little money and energy into an afterhours joint will probably be successful,
what with youth night at pegasus and platform soul at zythos ... or is that
tuesdays ... anyways, the light show really impressed me.  what are those six
light called that they had up front?  i don't know if they're called
intellibeams, lasers, gobos, or trackers.  anyways, i only caught tim zelch,
who kept flipping records a little too quickly for me.  and he'd always catch
the next record right before the track dropped into a buildup.  like i'm not
dj or anything, i'm just a kid ... but i know that i don't like hearing
someone play a buildup, then drop into another buildup 64 bars later.  record
after record.  i'd rather just hear it play out actually.  i mean seriously
the floor will be bumpin for a minute to <<bm ch bm ch bm ch bm ch>> and then
we just stand around for three minutes listening to organs playing over those
violins <<eeeeeee>>  is there some dj theory i don't appreciate?  but i will
admit the selection was tight.  some nice tweaky house tracks.

oh another thing, radio carson had me jumpin this afternoon to some acid
trance.  i watched some tv on mute with just closed captioning, preferring to
hear the ministry of the unknown radio dj.  fun fun.

i really like being on this list.  you kids rule.  

(most of the time) (don't let it go to your head)

love and rockets

That will wreak havoc on your eyesight.  I don't recommend it.

If you are going to do this (and if you do, please switch eyes and don't
wear it for too long) a pharmacy is probably your best bet.

Yes, you should click first on "The Garden" (sorry) for directions.  The ritm thing on there is old.  That space was going to be used for ritm.

That is a pretty wide range, considering nicotene is said to be more
addictive than heroin, and caffeine is at the low end of addictiveness.

>From the Addiction Research Foundation:
Physical dependence occurs when the body has adapted to the
presence of the drug, and withdrawal symptoms occur if its
use is stopped abruptly. The most common symptoms of withdrawal
among heavy amphetamine users are fatigue, long but
troubled sleep, irritability, intense hunger, and moderate to severe
depression, which may lead to suicidal behavior. Fits of
violence may also occur. These disturbances can be temporarily
reversed if the drug is taken again. 

So it doesn't look as bad as withdrawl from Heroin or Alcohol, but
still not very pleasant.

Actually the Ice Garden is a bit further than 10 minutes from Century
III Mall.  And if you're coming from Oakland it's much easier to take
the Liberty Bridge off of 376 west and after going through the Liberty
Tunnel make a left onto 51.  You'll stay on this to the party.

The vast majority of people who do prozac will not have anything
like you described happen to them. With any drug, there will be
people who have atypical reactions. Hell, it's one of the most
prescribed drugs in the country (I wonder if viagra is catching up).
If this happened to that many people, there would be a term for
it, like prozac rage or something equally stupid.

There will be a table set up for the net meet over near the snack bar.  Someone is
making a sign for it and I'll string some Christmas lights or something around that
area.

Thats kindof funny considering the other guy corrected him after he said it 
was strychnine.
Not reading because of a single point of ignorance is as ignorante as the 
single point of ignorance. :)
Ignoring what they say on the physical effects, I agree with the handling 
of the mental affects.  I always suggest to first trippers to do it in a 
controlled environment with people you trust and an experienced tripper 
that is either only lightly dosed or not dosed at all.

Ive found that the 'best' situation is to start out in a quiet darker rooom 
(around dusk or dawn) with a total of three people.  Not sure why its three 
people but that seems to be the magic number.  Two people is too intamite 
(unless your looking for something else besides a mental trip) and four 
people is too easy to turn into two and two people.  Three seems to be just 
the right amount to keep the conversationn going without presuring people 
into it.

i stopped reading this as soon as the strychnine references were made. do
some homework ppl  ....    strychnine is not put in this stuff, nor is it a
byproduct or ingredient in any of the recipies for it---the information is
out there   i didnt bother reading it much beyond that, usually as soon as
someone mentions strychnine or rat poison in regards to this stuff they
have no concept of what they're dealing with and quite simply thats bad.

Just to warn you Analoguesystems is known as being a fairly 
shady promoter. From what i've been told its somebody named 
Gabe (who IS Analogue) but this could be wrong i don't know
first hand. I do know that Analoguesystems threw Tight 2: 
Tighter and well a couple of the main head liners didn't show
or something like that. And here's a story i was once told
on why not to ever go to an Analoguesystems party once this
person was at a Detroit party and saw someone wearing a do
it yourself t-shirt. It showed a Webster's style definition 
of the word "shady". After the usual two or three meanings was
another: "Any person associated with Analogue Systems."
So take this for what its worth. It could be a great party and 
maybe not but i don't think i would go......Besides who wants 
to see DMC, it should just be Run and Jam Master Jay on stage.
peace 'n' beats.......

     my feet hurt. i wonder what that means...
     ok, i had a great evening (since it can't
     really be called a night) at metropol. :]

     shouts to: spike, jen, mskw1, liquid, and
     of course Xspyboy. thanks for coming over
     and saying hi to the black-clad geek. hope
     to see more list members at IGC.

     from about 11pm on the place was jumping.
     my friend tim spun his usual housey/vocal
     set, with a little too much variety for
     even my taste. i got on his case for that
     after the evening, which brings me to the
     main point of this message.

     i think that it sucks when promoters (or,
     in this case, night-club owners) pay the
     DJs less than initially agreed on. it 
     makes the DJ antagonistic, there's very 
     little that he/she (unless they're a big
     name, and that's another story) can do 
     about it, and if a DJ is unhappy i don't
     see how they're going to spin a good set.
     even if tim was throwing the discs off and
     on the tables like a fiend as is his wont,
     people seemed to be enjoying his set.
     honestly, if i wanted to make a DJ happy,
     i'd pay them slightly more than agreed 
     upon, especially if the crowd was as 
     large as expected. if people have a good
     time at an event, it's because of the 
     music, and the DJ is responsible for the
     music, and thus for the success of the
     party. so why underpay them? now my friend
     hates metropol. will he spin there again?
     probably. will he be suspicious of the 
     management? yes. will he spin a good set?
     i dunno.

     oh well. this is life.

     bye

Oh, the places from which some of us can scrape up money ... I know I've 
made 100/150 bucks just magically 'appear' before going to a party when 
I've wanted it badly enough.  Quite appalling, isn't it? (I do have a 
job, though.  Oh yeah, and I still live with my mom in the summer).

I've read of cases where Prozac made some people very violent -- 
completely the oppostie of what the drug is suppsed to do.  These are, 
however, extreme cases, and definitely not the norm.  Such an adverse 
reaction is not to be expected.

no... actually the precise number is 1354 hits.

i dont know where you got that whack-ass statistic, but there's no way
that's accurate. just a few of the factors that would change that
number (which seems REALLY high to me) are the PERSON and the dose of
the hit. i dont know what kind of physical endangerment you are
talking about either, but i know that several hits can rationalize
jumping off a bridge for the fun of it (friend of a friend... managed
to change his mind a couple of seconds before he decided to try it
out), and for an inexperienced user, a large dose can make you flip
out so bad your heart will beat so fast that your body wont be able to
take it any more. it's such a mental drug, and peoples' ability to
handle such a drug varies too widely, i dont think it is possible to
put a numerical value on it.

some of my fave "scientific factz":

*if you trip 10 times you are legally insane... 
*oh no - that's if you take 10 hits... 
*and if you take acid you can never be a pilot, or a surgeon, cause
they spinal tap you... 
*and e is cut with heroin, too.

I was once accidently given 22 drops of liquid. Each drop was about the
equivelent of 4-5 hits and I had a blast. It was scarey for a while tho but
in the end it was all good. I know alot of you are probably like ya right.
But its no shit you can believe if you want.

Peace

five hits can make you clench down on your jaw so hard that you
somehow manage to swollow a molar or two :)

Also a lot depends ont he acid.  I mean one hit can barely affect you
or it can alter your mind forever . . . it all depends.

What?!? Nobody overdoses on acid. It's equally as
hard as overdosing on pot. It just isn't something
that you can do. Maybe if you ate 20 or 30 sheets, you
could be getting into the danger zone. Shit, I
personally know people who have taken 40 at a time and
didn't have any problems with it. Where do you get your
information from?

it's nice as well, and also the easiest way to ruin yer life, to have a boy

short amount of time. i feel nice right now. i'm an emotional mess, but it
feels good. you know something is wrong when an aerosmith song on the radio

I'm afraid I don't understand.  You say "No," and then go on to give the 
exact number of doses that at the time happened to slip my mind.  Notice 
I said AT LEAST 1300 hits.  So, what, you agreed with me, but only 
sarcastically.  Like I was wrong and it's some kind of joke?

>i dont know where you got that whack-ass statistic, but there's no way

I was talking about PHYSICAL DANGER, not someone deciding to "jump off a 
bridge" or something else that people love to talk about that almost 
never happens.  Acid is physically safer than pot, than alcohol, than 
fucking aspirin -- PHYSICALLY.

Oh blah blah blah, sob sob.  He should have fucking known better and not 
done more than he could handle.  Oh, am I taking this too seriously and 
too personally?  Well, maybe because I'm sobbing right now because I'm 
trying to understand why some people can be so fucking mean in their 
replies when in actuality they don't have a piss-ass mother fucking clue 
what the fuck they're talking about in terms of hard science.  Anecdotal 
"evidence" means nothing, and people can just blow it out their uptight 
assess.

Well, I have a friend who smoked pot so often he fell off a bridge.  So, 
pot must be pretty fucking dangerous mentally.

Why are you implying that I, and my years of research, should be lumped

Jesus Christ.  I am fucking manic depressive and I am pretty damn hurt 
and upset right now.  

Excuss me while I go stab myself in the arm.  I just can't take it 
anymore.  I should just unsubscribe and hang out at alt.drugs where I 
belong.

I know it must be hard for many people not to hate me.  Relatively small 
things have the power of affecting me in very negative ways, and I've 
gone through my whole life feeling very sad, very angry, and very 
frustrated a steady percentage of the time.  I have a general distrust 
of all people until I know them personally, and I need constant 
reassurance from those close to me.  Forgive me if my inability to deal 
rationally with people gets in the way of my immediate sanity.  I just 
get to certain point where I just can't deal with things anymore.  I 
feel like I have to constantly defend myself, and it just wears me out.

      ok, i think i'll reply to the spirit of this
      message, as opposed to the actual substance,
      as this thread (as such) is getting a little
      out of hand.

      amanda, you are taking the replies to your
      message far too seriously. just because your 
      post was in earnest doesn't necessarily mean 
      that everyone else will treat it as such. in 
      the anarchic jungle of the internet there is
      no little red seal of truth on the messages
      of good intent. (and no, i do not need to be
      told about PGP, thanks anyway).

      you have to understand that there is so much
      lore, out-of-context (or just plain false)
      statistics that people, any people, are bound
      to take a number like 'more than 1300 hits of
      acid' with a grain of salt.

      or a bucket-load.

      everyone is the expert when it comes to popular
      drugs, yet sometimes even the people making 
      them (or, more often, cutting and/or distributing
      them) may know next to nothing about the real
      chemical effects of the substances they merrily
      ingest. i don't claim to know more than my inadequate
      chemistry background affords me, but i do make an
      attempt at self-education, plus i carefully check
      my sources. on the internet, you would do well to
      take the advice of well-manicured man: 'trust no
      one, mr. mulder.' and all the evidence we have is
      empirical, anyway.

      in any case, if you're going to try (and i welcome
      any effort in this regard, and have found amanda's
      posts to be interesting and actually useful) to educate
      the general public on the effects of any chemical
      on the human body, it would be very advisable to
      couch your claims in scientific terms.

      for example: 'a 85kg human can ingest more than
      250ml of lysergic acid dyethelamide before it's 
      inherent toxicity has any drastic or damaging
      effects.'

      i have no idea if that statement is valid - but
      even if it isn't, it can be proven false only
      by scientific means.

      but i digress (severely).

      what i _really_ wanted to say: please play nice.
      if you have an issue with someone, be rational
      and friendly about it. think three times before
      you poke fun at somebody else's post. the people
      i have met on this list (and in the rave scene
      in general) have been some of the nicest people
      i know. some of us have less of a faculty with
      words than others. sometimes what we mean to say
      is completely different than what we do.

      so smile, ok? trust me, you won't find a better 
      crowd anywhere - certainly not in alt.drugs.

      hugs,
     -geekboy

Ok, we are talking about two different styles of death here.
(I wouldnt be suprised if amanda hasnt already jumped on this :) but I 
gotta toss my two cents in before I start wigging out)
There is the physiological death from the chemical itself and a death by 
means related to the mental state that it puts you in.

The amount of lsd to kill a human purely on the lsd and not by actions from 
the person is extremely high if not infinite.

First off, you have to realize that there is ZERO relationship between body 
weight and the affect of lsd on the person. This was proven when it was 
first discovered and researched.  You can pull this facts from pretty much 
any psychology book that has any of the original papers. (Do a search for 
LSD-25 or the long name in whatever software your school uses for 
cataloging psychology research papers and articles) That was part of why 
LSD was so interesting to the medical and psychology fields, it was the 
first substance found that had this property, I dont know if others have 
been found since)

Secondly, there is no biological affect on the human from pure LSD except 
in the brain itself.  Unless you count choking on a crystal or wad of 
paper.

Death by actions related to the mental state of LSD however could be as low 
as a hit. It all depends entirely on how well the person 'takes' it.  There 
have been cases of people jumping off bridges and so forth from only a 
couple hits. Then there are friends of mine who I have witnessed eat entire 
sheets and only had an excesivly wild ride.  (Primarly being catatonic for 
several hours and enjoying it none the less) But still. There is no heard 
and fast, you will die from xx hits. (And no, this sheet was not 'weak')

I do not have the documents on hand to site references but if I required I 
will go find them again or see if I can find the set in my closet (I 
researched it for one of my psychology courses).
If you are going to refute me then please be prepared for me to ask for 
references. I realize this is unfair so ill go find mine if you go find 
yours. :)

It is a dangerous substance. I will fully support that.  Which is why I 
agree with the regulations concerning it.  I certainly would not want kids 
to be able to go buy hits at the drugstore and toss em back while driving 
down the road or something. Who knows how many gun crazed lunatics we could 
create from this. But you have to keep in perspective that as far as I have 
witnessed (and this is only through my witnessing so does not count as 
proof or hard facts). That provided the individual has an incling as to 
what they are getting into, they either will enjoy it, be indiferent or not 
enjoy it.  I have yet to have someone have a 'bad trip' their first time 
out. And I have never had someone 'flipout'.  This may just be damn good 
luck, or it may have something to do with how I inform people prior to 
their first uses, I dont know.

Just wanted to set the record straigt.  Just as strycnine in acid is a myth 
so is death by acid itself.  Death ON acid is possible though.  But I have 
only heard that through hearsay and can only hope it stays that way.

As an afterthought, if you have read this far then you might care, but you 
CAN control your trips.  It takes practice and willpower, but it is 
possible.  Trick is to work your way up to higher levels slowly and to 
understand what is going on.  Setup boundaries, and fallbacks, and so 
forth.  Learn to recognize the symptoms of a trip and shit you can be dosed 
and be just fine. (It happened to me once). Before each planned trip. 
define a safe zone. Whether it be a place or a person or even a thing. Its 
something to channel your thoughts toward when things get too intense.

no... actually the precise number is 1354 hits.

i dont know where you got that whack-ass statistic, but there's no way
that's accurate. just a few of the factors that would change that
number (which seems REALLY high to me) are the PERSON and the dose of
the hit. i dont know what kind of physical endangerment you are
talking about either, but i know that several hits can rationalize
jumping off a bridge for the fun of it (friend of a friend... managed
to change his mind a couple of seconds before he decided to try it
out), and for an inexperienced user, a large dose can make you flip
out so bad your heart will beat so fast that your body wont be able to
take it any more. it's such a mental drug, and peoples' ability to
handle such a drug varies too widely, i dont think it is possible to
put a numerical value on it.

some of my fave "scientific factz":

*if you trip 10 times you are legally insane...
*oh no - that's if you take 10 hits...
*and if you take acid you can never be a pilot, or a surgeon, cause
they spinal tap you...
*and e is cut with heroin, too.

Just in case I wasnt being clear, I wasnt meant to refute everything Franki 
was saying but try to be a little more concise about it.  Took a third read 
to realize frankie was almost saying what I said. Sorry bout that.

Dude, I lost some relatives to cancer, and not only is it hard on them 
but it is hard on everyone else.  No one wants to be like that.  They 
said they made developments on how to cure cancer, but I dunno, there so 
much of it going on out there.  Tell Scott Forbush I am praying for him, 
and I hope others do as well.  

We lose a lot of people in the scene, drugs, driving accidents, 
shootings etc.  Cancer is the last thing we even think about.  
Anyway I hope everyone writes out a card and sends it in.  I am sure it 
would help in a big way!  :)

I love you Scott Forbush!

Does anyone out there know if you want to look up say, a REALLY OLD
message, how do you do it?  I tried the majordomo thingie, but I can't 
figure out what and where to go. I tried one Archive thing but I think 
it is just for the people who operate a site.  

Can anyone help?  

Peace out

oddly enough, www.hotmail.com will turn up stuff from the archives.   i
found out by doing a search for my email address to see what turned up and
*voila* there was the pb-cle archives.
the majordomo has nothing to do with the archives, there is a separate
script that handles that.
the majordomo archives are something that is never really implemented-more
or less.

well, maybe i should call it a mini-review <there will be a longer one
posted later, rest assured>


i just wanted to tell everybody that Intergalactic Circus was the *best*
party I've *ever* been to, hands down.

it was one of those things where after you look back on it you just know
it will be one of those truly special and amazing events...

more later, i promise...


peace and love,

p.s. so, what'd everybody else think??  <i want *reviews*, dammit!>  :->

INtergalactic Circus was awesome.  Except for three AWFUL THINGS, 
someone somehow slipped me some acid(I believe--I have never done it 
before).  I was scared half the freakin' night, so I decided to candy 
flip(not caring too much--I was too afraid).  But I felt good for like 
ten minutes, then I got sick(I started hearing about herion in the e).  
Then I freaked out again(I wasn't on herion though).  I smoked up some 
and meditated with my friend during Zelch(what ever his name was).  Then 
I felt good.  Thank you to all you dolls in the bathroom who helped me 
through my little adventure.  If it wasn't for you I would have been 
even worse.  Now I know never too do drugs again or touch or eat peoples 
goodies again.  It is 3:22 pm and I never even went to sleep yet.

The music was fun.  I wanted jungle though, too many breaks. That is 
just my opinion.  The light show was awesome.  So many people came(how 
many were there, 2000?).  I didn't do the net meet I was too f-ed up, 
sorry.   It looked like it went well, I seen some of yall. Richard 
"humpty" Vision was great, I had to leave after that.  

May I ask what was up with the ballroom turning into fog mania(that 
scared me so so BADLY)?  I really should sleep now(damn insomnia from 
the e and acid). OH well, that is all I have to express.

Benny

INtergalactic Circus was awesome.  Except for three AWFUL THINGS, 
someone somehow slipped me some acid(I believe--I have never done it 
before).  I was scared half the freakin' night, so I decided to candy 
flip(not caring too much--I was too afraid).  But I felt good for like 
ten minutes, then I got sick(I started hearing about herion in the e).  
Then I freaked out again(I wasn't on herion though).  I smoked up some 
and meditated with my friend during Zelch(what ever his name was).  Then 
I felt good.  Thank you to all you dolls in the bathroom who helped me 
through my little adventure.  If it wasn't for you I would have been 
even worse.  Now I know never too do drugs again or touch or eat peoples 
goodies again.  It is 3:22 pm and I never even went to sleep yet.

The music was fun.  I wanted jungle though, too many breaks. That is

Intergalactic Circus was the bomb!   It was the best party I have been
to in a long time.  The music and lights were great, and for most of
the night I was satisfied with whatever room I was in.  That laser
that made designs in the small room was tight!  The vibe was great,
and I thought the Ice Gardens was a pretty good place to throw a
party.  My only complaint was that the main room was super hot.  I
lived with it, but I found the other room a much more comfortable
environment (accept for when the fog was so dense you couldnn't see yo
hand in front of yo face).  Props to Circuit 6.  Sorry I missed your
set.  I heard it was the bomb!

Later,
Josh

first off, remember that stuff i said about not enjoying raves anymore?  i
wasn't at a rave when i wrote it.  i hadn't been to a rave since digital
genesis, and for as nice as dg was, after last night (/this morning), i fully
appreciate:
IT WASN'T SHIT!
a really big room with concrete on the ground just doesn't compare to a
bathtub-esque rink (given how thick, hot, and humid the air was, and the shape
of the rink, if you use your imagination you can think of it as one really
fucking big bathtub) with a smooth dance floor, and BIG BOY!!!  ( :] x 3 ) and
that huge ass hamburger?  did anybody else notice that cardboard drawing of a
wizard on the main room stage above the left stack of speakers?  i did...it
didn't appear two dimensional...
the second room consistently gave me the impression as one of the wickedest
dance floors i'd been on in a long time.  i think the geometric pattern on the
ground helped, as did the smoke that was so thick that i put my backpack down
on the ground against a wall to dance, and shortly after discovered that i had
to struggle to find it.  i wonder if they realized that smoke + dark walls =
walking into walls.  i realized it, about three or four times.  fortunately, i
was wearing a baseball hat forwards and the brim took most of the impact.
at first, i was getting down to the circuit 6 set in room 2 (they were
9-10pm).  i can't wait untill they get a massive audience.  they're sure to
tear the shit out of it with smooth ass mixes and tight track selection.
beyond them, i have no idea who was spinning.  i know certain people were
there, and i remember enjoying the atomic babies, but i have no idea who was
who musically.  i don't think it made much of a difference, either.
i'd like at this point to say hi to all of the people i befriended in one way
or another, via either talking, smiling while dancing, candy/ fruit snack
giving, massage giving (mad props to todd for acquiring this wonderful hand
held massage giving device: you press it down and it vibrates.  beats the shit
out of a pager any day as far as nut sack (and other places) vibration.  i on
several occasions walked around giving random strangers massages to a mixed,
generally positive response).  hi tod frankie josh(thanks for the ride, that
muffin tasted great, sorry i didn't finish my chocolate milk <at eaten park>)
ian steve ben tom john andy spike geekboy amanda kidw/funnyblackshirtfromlist
kidw/greenshirtfromlist kidw/tophat henry thewholeruckuscrew(garbage can -
drum playing people) and a whole bunch of others...y'all were great, thanks
for not stealing anything from my backpack, i hope you had as much fun as i
did......
fun games i played:  massage party, following the squares aroound the 2nd room
in thick fog, alligning myself w/ the dance floor while dancing, spinning
around on my knees, hands, etc, on red dot (face off circle) in main room,
going nuts with these crazy glasses which turned reality into a party (ok, a
bigger party)...more on that later*., fan party, breaking a rule and going to
the penalty box (but not in that order), dancing w/ the "2" dimensional
wizard, wishing i had skills enough to sever a balloon to play w/
my only (mild) complaint musically is that the (main room especially) music
was too trancy: wonderful trancy build-ups, but a failure to sustain a hard,
body-rocking beat to go along with it.  i found most of the house beats a
little too slow.  i had much energy and probably could have stayed partying
untill noon.  around 5-6 a dj came on that met my wishes and threw down a
(main room) set that just tore me to pieces (in a good way)...bummer it
happenned so late, b/c i had to leave in the middle of it.
you know wyclef can rap in french! (i'm jealous...oh well, i ought to practice
(i know french) ) 

lions and tigers and
sethCrazYbaum

later*: these glasses tweaked light in different directions, made the main
stage look crazy.  some geometric scientific shit going on for sure.  someone
gave the glasses to me, and i gave them to someone with a camcorder, so i
don't know where they're from our where they're going.  any know where i can
get my hands on some?  they can't be too expensive, i'm geussing a toy store
might have them.

ps- c y'all at life is but a dream, now i really want to throw a party, who's
flagstaffing wednesday, why is wednesday so wackly spelled?

I thought nothing would beat BIZ.  The feeling of the large room was
great during Atomic Babies.  Everything in that room seemed to have the
same house beat that is minimal and grand.  Although the bass was a tad
too much, I had to turn around because it was just rupturing my ear. 
The second room had a lower temperature, better lights, and a more
intelligent sound.  And product 19 just ripped shit to hell.  You have
to pay a price for fun, it's not some equation where you can just put
shit in and not expect opposite effects to fly out.  I am incopacitated
at the moment.  I have repetitve stress damage on the front of my shins
so bad I can't even walk.

This may take a while, so hold onto your pants.  My crew arrived
around 8:00 or so and just chilled for a little bit outside until 8:45
or so, when we went in and checked the venue out.  

Venue digresion: OK, this was a very nice site.  Like everybody else
said, really the only two things bad about it were the heat in the
main room and the immense amount of fog at certain times in the second
room (there was a short light outage in the main room, but it was
cleared up).  Other than that is was great.  Props for thinking about
making signs to catch people tagging.  Everybody was looking out for
people . . . I hope it worked.  The fact that there were two bathrooms
was nice.  The bar overlooking the huge dancefloor/hockey floor was
really cool.  Those random people stopping in for a drink must have
been excited.
(end venue digresion)

So, we went into the second room and got a feel for the mixer and set
up.  It took about half an hour to get the shit set up and ready to
go, so our set started late @ 9:15.  I was really happy with our
performance, but wished we could have had some more time, cause there
is sooo much material we didn't cover.  But there were a lot more
people there than I expected for 9-10.  Thanks to everyone who
complimented us on our set and all the people that were dancing too. 
We didn't get paid . . . but that was our own damn fault cause we
didn't discuss it w/ kelly or rich at all.

Light Digresion: The lights were awesome, and I only have one
complaint about them which is: there should have been more lights in
the second room.  There were only four lights and a laser in the
second room compared to like 50 or so in the other room.  The main
room set up was amazing . . . with like 20-30 lights across the main
portion of the stage . . . and at least six tower set-ups going down
the rest of the length of the rink with 4-8 lights on them.  The
massive lights on the main stage were awesome.  When shone out
half-way down the rink they made a circle about 15-20 feet wide.  The
laser in the second room was rough doing shit like projecting a 3-d
cube and sphere and shit!

So after our set we went and checked the rest of the place out.  Shit
was slamming and people were starting to arrive.  I saw Rachel of GBB
fame (infame?) with a VIP pass (?) . . . she was dancing her ass off
for a while, but I didn't see her towards the end.  All the sets were
pretty damn good.  I especially liked smoov, thomas michaels and
prodcut 19 (this guy had the dancefloor packed with HI-HI-HI-NRG
trance/breakbeats.  As far as I'm concerned he should have gone on
instead of tim zelch and sine in the mainroom in place of felix da
housecat who unfortunately was a no show).  I couldn't get into atomic
babies as much as everybody else, but I still enjoyed them thoroughly.  

Vibe digresion:  Best vibe in a looong time.  Forreal.  Shadiness was
at a minimum (sp?) and good vibes were being spread all around :)  I
don't think a single person asked me if I wanted meth (as opposed to
most parties where everyother person is tryin' to push it).  And rolls
were plentiful, but not being shoved down your throat (lemons and
limes!).  Everyone seemed to be having a good time except for "the
violent guy" who I didn't even see, but people said he was shoving ppl
on the dancefloor and was dragged out by the po-po.  Speaking of the
police, they were pretty cool as far as I could tell.  They were
there, but in no ways (to my knowledge) intrusive.

Sound digresion:  Well done.  I heard don put a lot of work into this
setting up for two full days and it seemed to have not been in vain. 
The second room's sound system was powerful enough to keep the crowd
jumping, but not too loud.  The main room's system was very nice.  The
set-up filled the room (well not the very last quarter or so, but that
part didn't really matter anyways) but wasn't extremely loud when you
were in front.  It was really fucking loud, but could be dealt with,
without severe damage to your ears (at least I hope not).

All in all this was a great event and one that I badly needed.  I hope
downlow and five-star got their money back (and some more if possible
:)  I don't know if we'll be seeing more events from these guys or
not, but I hope so.  They had their shit together like not many other
people do.  Folders organizing shit.  Printed out guest lists being
crossed off as ppl entered.  Everything ready on time (at least pretty
damn close to it).  All in all very profesionaly done.

random shout outs:
Geekboy: Gotta love that soccer :)
Tom: why you tryin' to steal my gasmask?
lil' sarah: Hey, I meant to go up to you and introduce myself and
whatnot, but the one time I saw you, I was in a hurry to get some
where . . . sorry I couldn't talk.
xspyboy: where were you?
dapwezz: Sorry I didn't give you a call today . . . my boy ben is
leaving tommorrow for 5 weeks so I chilled w/ him.  I'll give you my
pager # as soon as I get it (like a week).

everyone who was there: Oh yeah!
everybody who wasn't there: Sorry you couldn't come!

yeah, i was laughing at the violent guy for about 10 minutes.  he gave
me one of his infamous violent hugs and screamed at me to start dancing
(but i already was! =]).  then five minutes later, in the main room,
same area, he started pushing people.  the violence was funny at first,
but then i just had to leave.  it was PCP*.

first of all....a shout out to EVERYONE i ran into at the party....it was great to finally meet at least some of the people that keep things moving on the list.  absolut and frankie....great set....frankie, i was glad to see you could make it....did the random emails to ma help??  andy the pooh...where were you??  you left to get the guys from the hotel, then i never saw you again...it was nice chatting while it lasted.  seth....you truly are dabaum!!!!  trouty, and god knows who all i'm forgetting....it was great. jade!!!!  i must say...i think i got more hugs from you than i did from everyone else the rest of the nite....keep em coming!!!


now for the actual review.....

four star system

space: (***)  my only complaints were pretty much the same as everyone else's....heat in the main room...also, i personally like a chill out area that is somewhat separate from the music rooms....the whole directly in between the two rooms thing was a little annoying to me....but hey...it all worked out.

lights (****) the lighting was wicked....the laser in the second room....i sat and stared at it for abour 30 min straight....and i was stone cold sober all nite....the lack of lighting in the second room was bothersome, but it gave the room a kinda dark feel that definitely worked for me....but w/ the added fog...it was almost impossible to find people or bags in there.

sound (** 1/2)  i love bass....but there is a point where it gets to be too much....i was waiting for the glass around the rink to blow...esp at the bar on the one end....something about the way it hit.....it just didn't appeal to me.....the second room though....couldn't have been better....

music (****)  granted...i spent most of my nite in the smaller room b/c it was cooler and i dug the music more....but all in all....i was really happy with what i heard....

vibe (*******)  i have to say....this party made me feel like a cross between halloween and christmas....i got so many hugs and so much candy i think my teeth are gonna fall out.  the vibe was so friendly....although a couple of my friends got attatcked by the dude w/the tounge and i almost got taken out by the guy they tied up and threw on the main floor....everyone had a smile on their face the entire nite.

overall (*****)  great work guys....i hope you decide to do some more of this kinda stuff..... 


again...much love to everyone i met....hope everyone had as good a time as i did

Hey_You

hi.

i just bought 12 tickets to the beastie boys show in cleveland...

these tickets are all accounted for...

*BUT*

there is a good chance one or two ppl will flake out b/w now and the day of
the show...i would say its probable i will have an extra ticket...SO...if
you want to go, but can't plan that far ahead, or won't have money til
later or something...and are *really* interested in going, email me
privately so i know to get in touch with you around aug 7-10...


peace,
hossam

i'm a slightly inexperienced raver, so tell me:  how often do raves get thrown
at venues with such a wacky atmosphere?  i was thriving off (what has been
complained about by others) wacky stuff (like gas passing dinosaurs) like the
all encompasing second room fog, big boy, the hamburger, and the wizard
picture.  the freaks were a little too much for me, especially the one guy who
put on a show at the chill table which included (if i remember correctly)
licking a metal stick 6 inches long which he claimed was covered with acid.
even though they were eerie, i was still glad that the freaks were there,
because they added a creative twist.  my only other raves thus far are ghetto
booty battle, digital genesis, and something at the irish center, none of
which had the same creative flair.  music and dancing is great, but without
such creativity, i find it repetitive.  at ghetto booty battle i went
noticeably nuts (someone said "i wish i was out of my mind" while pointing to
my mind.) while at intergalactic i felt right at home.

on a different note:  
i wonder if i can keep up my raving habbits as well as my scholarly excellence
(for those who don't know, i've pulled off stuff like a 1550 on the sat, first
try).  raves are the shiznit, but i'm an intellectual at heart...

another note:
the list is starting to fuck with instant messages.  i like instant messages.
if you happen to catch me online, send me instant messages.  fuck with my
brain.  i like having my brain fucked with.  hopefully, i'll get fucked with
enough that i'll spend enough time online to drive up our aol bill enough that
we'll either get off the dumb hourly billing plan or i'll switch to my pitt e-
mail name, which i don't want to do because it's a bunch of wack characters,
not daabaum, because hey, being da baum is a good thing, even if it's spelled
wrong (this was no accident; when i signed up, dabaum was taken.  on the other
hand, i spelled my name seth baam on the psat's)

another note:
too all throwing life is but a dream:  
i'm still available to help out.  this includes coming early/ staying late to
set up/ clean up, bringing stuff (i'm stockpiling fruit snacks), and whatever
else you can think of.

learning to rap in french,
sethCraZYbaam

welp,
here goes

   i didn't get there till about 2am ((because i was working till then)) and
i'm not sure who was playing then, but it was decent, but i began to notice
there wasn't a whole lot of variety through out hte night, in the main room   
   i caught Product 19 and was very happy i did, it was definatly some good
dancing ..gotta love it
   ... i didn't catch all of 7-UP's set, but i enjoyed what i heard...but i
also heard some some other tunes of a different beat coming from the second
room, so i had to check it out for awhile
   ...and as it has been mentioned, it was really hot in the main room, but i
found i could dance to the back, and cool down by the huge fans..which
helped...until i was 10 feet from the fan....but oh well,..and i did notice
all the fog in the second room too...it was neat and annoying ...
   now i'd have to say the strongest point that i think anyone who was there
had to notice, ..and that was the vibe, it was so strong you could dance with
it :)  this party definatly put some real 'plur' into effect, it was nice, i
definatly enjoyed the non-shadiness of it all 
    and many hugs to all the fellow net geeks i saw/danced/talked with.... i'd
name some, but that means i'd forget some, so no names..damnit you know who
you are ;)~
    oh and i whole heartedly agree on the fact that the lights where awsome!  
      ((and you gotta love the decorative stautes...long live big boy :) and
the hamburglar))

     well my brain has now reached its all time low capacity with no
sleep..in...days...i need...rest... none yet.. ...must stop

the tired pink elephant

I really can't pinpoint when it happened, I was accepting drinks from so 
many people and stuff.  I remember this one guy who gave me a drink was  
really suspicious and I only thought to myself that I shouldn't have 
taken that drink until after. Anyway, I don't blame anyone, it was a 
learning experience I believe.  Besides being freakin scared, I had some 
really philosophical and off the wall thoughts that made me think. 
People were really nice, helpful and friendly.  I just quit with the 
drugs and stuff.  

I still feel sick though

Aghhh

anyone hitting "Bitches Get the Smack Down" this Friday in Indy? After all the
talk about the flyer, I just realized that a good friend of mine is funding a
large part of the party :) It's always so much nicer to go to parties that you
know are thrown by nice people. ANYWAYS, I'm venturing out to Indy this
Friday, despite the fact that I had told myself that I was going to lay off
partying for awhile, but oh well :) Anyone else going out? I would love to see
some other net-ravers there.

This was indeed the most phenomenal party thrown in recent history.
I thank you Rich and Kelly for making this all work out so well.
*hugs* go out to all the netravaz that showed.
and I am bushed... time to relax and catch sum zzzzzzz's

if said individual did not know he was dosed and if the acid kicked in right 
while he was driving home and he hallucinates that there's a deer in the 
middle of the road (when there really wasn't) and swerves off the road to 
avoid it, running straight into a railing, causing him to go through the 
windshield, then you would have a major catastrophe!!...in addition if there 
was an investigation, there would be no way for the coroners to detect the 
acid unless they perform a spinal tap!...it makes me nauseous to think that 
there may be people so morally corrupt out there!!...i can't even imagine
just how awful the karma of these people must be like...completely damned!!!

wasnt too loud, i was dancin my lil a off in front of the speakers & i was
fine. A lot of fast HARD bass beats which i xtremely liked. Those barrel drum
ppl were very kewel too!!!!
Place              ====))> I agree that the main floor was xtemely hot, 2nd
room was Phat.. nice & cool.. small & private like.. stayed there for a
while.. after bein in there, u didnt wanna go back to the other one. hehe. the
dj's in there tore it up also.

Excellent vibe, overall GREAT time. Beautiful job on the lights!!! Does anyone

On Tuesday July 28th, Pittsburgh industrial heroes Mindless Faith will be
performing live at 9:30pm at The Pollinator (above the Oakland Beehive).

Following the performance will be Digital, the weekly
electronica/industrial night which I DJ (dj -brian); there will be a
special guest DJ as well.

If you would like to attend, I have a number of FREE PASSES (bearer + 1
guest) available. I can drop them in the mail to you, or meet you in
person in the Oakland area of Pittsburgh.  I can also probably arrange to
put you on the guest list if you'd like. 

Unfortunately, this is a 21+ event.  =(

Email me for details or passes.

Not to be rude, but why would you decide to take 
more drugs when you are freaking out that someone 
slipped you acid. I would think that the last 
thing you would want to do is put more unknowns
into your system. That seems more *wtf* to me simply
because, unlike someone slipping you acid, it is 
something that you can control.

But hey, that's just my opinion,

acid unless they perform a spinal tap!...it makes me nauseous to think that 

[David Schwanke]  You cannot detect acid with a spinal tap.
The lsd chemical leaves the body 15 minutes to half an hour after the first 
effects kick in. Usually
through sweat but by this time it has already broken down into normally 
present chemicals in the body. Amanda can you back this up? (Or correct me 
if I am wrong :)

Just wondering...What did you find wrong with DG? I thought
it was a great time. Good location, good music, good lights, good
vibe, good party. Didn't notice any negative reviews at the time.
What didn't you like?

i finally woke up after igc...~whew!~

IGC was simply amazing!  The mammoth proportions of the space, loads of
happy kids and niceness....i didn't attend digital genesis, but this was
by far the most impressive indoors pittsburgh event i've ever gone to.

I don't know if i can speak on anything more since i spent much of the
night chatting and flyering.  I'm not sure who was spinning, but the
mainroom set ~2:30-3:00 that had some hardcore beats and even a jungle
tune dropped in was wicked as hell....the 2nd room had an excellent
vibe...it reminded me of one of the rooms @ an event at G+K a few years
ago...an odd nostalgia.

Anyway - thanks rich + kelly - you guys did an excellent job! :)

Okay kidz, I just wanted to throw my two cents into this IGC review fest.
I had an AWESOME fucking time.  It wuz fun meeting the few listies that i
bumped into or knew already, namely Andy the Pooh and geekboy, but it what
really made me happier then anything else wuz the number of glittered out
candy kidz that showed up in their homemade phaties, with stuffed animals
and bracelets and necklaces and stickers!  It really boosted my confidence
in the fact that Pittsburgh is finally getting out of it's K'd out shaddy
daze!  Woo Hoo...

And for any of those who i didn't directly meet, i wuz the kid with the
white ringer cure t-shirt , pink and blue glow sticks, and the sailor moon
bag full o' candy for everyone!!!!  I haven't felt a vibe like that since
Cheer and i don't think i've ever seen that many smiley faces in one
concentrated area...in...well...ever!!!

Anyway, i gotta get my sorry ass home for some food and off to work
again...peace out kiddies...and i hope to meet somemore of you and
LIBAD!!!  PLUR

L~I~Q~U~I~D

     this one is going to be difficult to encapsulate,
     but i'll do my best. brace yaself.

     actually, i had planned to be in mexico at this 
     time, but due to lack of money i am still here
     and it looks as if it will stay that way, sadly.
     so instead of being in mexico drinking tequila
     in a roadside cafe, i ended up in a dark room full
     of smoke, strangers, and loud music, playing 
     soccer while on acid.

     <wry grin>

     actually, i had this party all planned out. i 
     would show up early, shoot about three rolls of
     kodak tri-X and one or two of gold 400, then go
     to the netmeet, then get messed up and have fun.
     i also had a stack of flyers for our student
     organization here at pitt, which i was going to
     pass out to various and sundry.

     things didn't quite work out. the first thing i
     noticed was that my lenses were too long. i am partial
     to long lenses, as i like doing flat, tight shots,
     but you need really short lenses for an indoor
     venue. then, halfway through the first roll of
     tri-X, my camera's battery gave out. so i gave it
     up as a bad deal, and stashed the camera. next
     time i'm bringing a 20-70mm zoom and a tripod. or
     nothing at all :].

     we showed up early, about 9pm, and got in about 
     9:30. the place was empty, and we wandered around
     admiring the venue. the first thing i noticed was
     the painted concrete dancefloor in the main arena.
     the floor makes _such_ a difference to my overall
     enjoyment of any rave. in short, the venue was 
     as near to perfect as they come. the second room
     could have done with a little more wall space, but
     was really good nonetheless.

     one of the first mistakes i made was accepting some
     acid from 'booty man' jason. i guess i just forgot
     how acid makes me paranoid, but there were other
     factors involved in this party that affected my
     general disposition anyway, so i'm not blaming the
     drugs. in any case, i had fun for the first three 
     hours or so, playing soccer with jason and the two 
     girls i came with. note: jason is an interesting 
     anomaly in and of himself. he looks like he stepped
     out of a surge commercial - short bleached hair,
     huge black wraparound shades, big black jeans, and
     massive black boots. he just stands in front of
     the stage looking like he's been transplanted out
     of a music video, and 'dancing'. yeah, finally 
     somebody else who keeps their feet on the floor :].
     black boots forever... i'm sure some of you know
     this guy.

     about midnight i started having problems. i'm sure
     it was a combination of things. i hadn't seen _anyone_
     that i knew at all, except rich/kelly, and i hardly
     know them, and the girl i had brought to the rave,
     whom i'd met at metropol two nights before, kept 
     dancing with somebody else (more on that later). i have
     to say that in my normal frame of mind, i'd be perfectly
     up to dancing in a room full of complete strangers, but 
     i wasn't quite in my normal state of mind. then i
     found liquid (you're the greatest, glitter boy), and 
     after a little while, decided to go to the net-meet.

     from what i understand, it was an above average
     net-meet, but unfortunately i wasn't functioning
     on my normal level and even then i'm really bad with
     names. i tried to explain how my canon SLR worked
     to tom, i think, without any success. random shouts
     to everyone, anyway :]. sorry for not being too lucid.

     so far, everything i had intended to accomplish at
     this party had pretty much washed. the place was so
     huge i couldn't find tim zelch (it turned out he
     was spinning) or dori+darla, who had said they'd be
     there. i was kinda annoyed. half of the reason i had
     come to the party was to take this girl i'd met before
     to her first rave - she'd asked me to. so i went and
     found her, and asked her if she was having fun.
     sure, she said. then i asked her if she'd ever done
     e. no, she said, but her friend had told her to try
     it.

     duh. [kick myself mentally]

     y'know, i wish somebody had taken _me_ to my first
     rave, and made me take e with them. but then again,
     that was about 4 years ago in england, and the people
     i was going with weren't in great control of their
     lives, and i don't think drugs of any description 
     would have done me much good at that time. i mean,
     i was 13-14 years old, and had no idea what was going
     on.

     but anyway, the short story is that i took this really
     nice person to their first rave, did x with them (and
     acid, but that's different) and ended up having an
     incredibly good time. i dunno, e is great, but doing
     it with somebody who has never done it before, let
     alone been to a rave, makes it about ten times better.
     plus it was really controlled, unlike my usual drug
     experiences. just seeing the look on her face and hearing
     her say 'sooo much fun' in a little blissful voice was
     better than any drug.

     wheee...

     this post has gone all over the place, i know, but this
     was hardly an objective experience. i do want to say 
     that the party was great, the lights were impressive,
     the sound system levels were perfect (and i had earplugs -
     which meant i could dance by the speakers for long
     periods of time, which is ever so much fun while loaded
     up with you-know-what) and the venue just kicked ass.
     i loved all the sets after and including atomic babies
     (especially atomic babies :).

     bad things? only one. there is this strange phenomenon
     that seems to be limited to myself (but if anybody else
     gets it PLEASE talk to me, i'd love to discuss it). it
     may just be because of my social hypersensitivity, but
     for some reason i get a lot of antagonism (usually 
     completely unspoken, but not always) from some guys.
     it may be because of the way i dress, or something to
     do with my attitude (i don't know what that would be)
     but i can get evil looks just walking around. at 
     phunktion it was just amusing, cause my mind was very
     much my own at that party, but at IGC it was really
     disturbing. certain people i am extremely comfortable
     with, like 'mr booty' jason, whom i had never seen in 
     my life before, but ended up doing some highly entertaining
     and rather disturbing booty dancing with, to the delight
     of several onlookers. but this one guy (i don't know
     who he is, and honestly don't want to) took things 
     way too far. i don't know if other guys go to raves
     to pick up people - i certainly don't, although i'll
     dance with anybody who wants to; that's what i'm there
     for. but if two people are obviously having fun 
     together, why even bother? i'm sure i'm not making
     a lot of sense here, and really, it was something
     pretty subtle, but it was definitely real, and it
     was the only thing to mar an otherwise wonderful night.
     discussion on this subject?

     but i won't complain. life is like that, and i can
     quite honestly say that this was, so far, a damn
     good contender for the best weekend of my life so
     far.

     and if you are my parents or university of pittsburgh
     administration, i do not condone drug use, and am
     not in the habit of inducing artificial moods through
     the use of chemicals. so there. and techno is evil and
     is corrupting our youth. 

     :P

     hugs

Not often enough.  I think wackyness is a big key to rave enjoyment.
Don't get me wrong - i can go just for the music - but wackyness puts me
in the happiest of moods. However in this age of big ass raves and
commercialization and 'rave products', etc... promoters are less willing
(or aren't even about) that kind of 'pee-wees playhaus' style wackery.
Pretty much its up to us kids as individuals to 'bring on the goofyness'
ourselves.  Go for it: wear that sequined gown with the rubber turkey
mask.  You don't even have to go that far.  Sharing toys + candy (frooty
goodness) + glitter or even just having an open attitude is a good good
thing.

No doubt...i think its the raves you've been to that have given you this
impression.  GBB sounded like on of the biggest disasters ever...DG was
trying to be a bit more hygenic than most events (i wasn't there so i
can't speak more on it)...if you went to subphunc the main element there
was definitly music...

Many ravers have large "SAT style" and other forms of intellect...i don't
think it hurts in the least.  If you're thinking it in a chemical
sense...well i think it depends on your brain type.  However, if you stay
out every night, or even every weekend, and sleep in the next day, it'd
bound to have some effect on 'scholarly excellence' - reguardless of if
its raving, zookeeping or dumpster diving.

well, i guess perhaps my opinion is biased cuz i left when i didnt want 
to, but this was a great party, just not the best ive been to.
i arrived late (1:30) after getting off work, and only stayed till 
4:30...

i dunno, i want overly impressed by the music in the main room....it 
wasnt bad, it just wasnt making me jump around like an idiot, which i 
what i prefer.

however, joshua ryan's set was nice in the second room, and product 19 
dropped the best set ive heard in a million years.
i fucking love him, hes so great..and he stgarted with the sample of the 
little thing at the begginning of the soft parade by the doors..

i guess this could have been an awesome party, but i had to leave too 
damn soon...i felt so unhardcore:) but i wasnt even tired....and i had 
to work the next day for a long time too....
oh well, it was organised very well, and set up nice...the lights and 
sound were both excellent....a fuckin great BIG party..
i just didnt get to get into it:(
congrats rich and kelly:)

Hi,

I'm a CMU student, and I've just recently subscribed to this list, so I
don't know how it works in regards to notification of upcoming events. 
I've never been to a rave before, but I'd really love to go to one. 
I've done acid several times and e once...  I absolutely loved dancing
my ass off when I was on e, and I can't imagine how much more fun it
would be in the rave atmosphere with lots and lots of people around me
doing the same thing...  i hope to find out, though..

in any case, i'm up in mass for the next couple weeks, but I'll be back
in the 'burgh around the 17th of August..  I was wondering if anyone
knew of any events that far in the future, or if I should just keep up
with the mailing list (which I plan to day anyway)...  I've really
enjoyed reading all the posts on the Intergalactic Circus and really
wish I could have been there..

Thanks in advance,
Matt

 Just wondering...What did you find wrong with DG? I thought
 it was a great time. Good location, good music, good lights, good
 vibe, good party. Didn't notice any negative reviews at the time.
 What didn't you like?
 
 -Az >>

I really liked DG!! Very good party! sasha & digweed i luved!! but 2 words....
CREATURE COMFORTS!!!  I was talkin comfort wise ( sorry if i did not make that
clear) Nice clean place, smooth floor, Air conditioning...  in the 2nd room at
least, BATHROOMS, running water, snack bar etc.. Stuff that i look for & think
are a nice touch.. u might think that other things make a better party but
those things for ME make a party more comfortable :)~ do not rip on me 4 this
but i am sure there are a few peeps out their who agree ( i hope ) not that i
am "miss rave" expert just my opinion.

peace!

as i understand ....
the lsd can be detected 1-8 days later in a piss test, i dunno if thats the
actual lsd or related byproducts or broken down parts of the lsd molecule.
hair tests can supposedly detect for months, dunno the specifics on that one.
fyi, most chems can be detected 1-8 days from a piss test except pot which
is 10-40 days.  pot (thc) is fat soluble, and your fat cells like to hang
on to it a bit longer, while the others are water soluble and and you pee
them out faster.
to add to the original thread, i doubt a coroner would look for lsd for a
car fatality without good cause.

whooooa, it was a fun party.  (happy belated birthday rich!)
when we got there some guy had a 5 inch screwdriver in his nose, he just
pulled it out when i noticed, i kinda wish i could've seen more of the
freak show bit, but thats all i saw =(   ...  was it the apocalypse circus
sideshow???   i saw them at morph 1 a few yrs ago and never heard of them
since?   i dont remember what the guys looked like sooooooo......
the music seemed a 50/50 split.   i caught the tail end of tim zelch (i
think, 2nd room before product 19 ...)   and it was pretty cool, product 19
was cool too.    atomic babies were awesome, i thought it was better than
the last few times i've heard them...
i wanted to steal the big boy by the stage, that was awesome, baaaaabeeee!
i kept thinking of dr. evils getaway ship in austin powers.   
the pb.cle.net.meet was cool, my non.net.geek friend eric (keeps
introducing himself as gravit-e) was hanging around "pretending to be a
geek" ...  he's getting to know alot of you and keeps buggering me to hook
up his mom/brothers computer to the .net   =)
i kinda expected to see more ppl at the meet, but everyone was scattered
all around.  oh well.
it was cool meeting a few new faces, hey_you, andy the pooh (you gotta see
his poohs outfit!), doh... who else did i meet?
saw a few of the ppl that were at mskw1's bbq too, henry and i forgot the
other fellows name...?
i hope there's more produkthaus bbqs!!!

glad everyone had fun !!!   hope downlow keeps it up....
trouty.

that is definitely a point well made. i was going to tell this person that i
felt that raving has definitely had a negative impact on my scholarly
excellence, but i suppose that it wasn't directly raving but the lifestlye
that i had taken on since going to a lot of parties. if you stay focused and
keep close to you what is important in your life, i'm sure you won't have much
of a problem. i did find personally however, that it's easy to slip into
something that isn't as easy to get out of. i didn't realize i had that much
of a problem until it was too late. moderation is the best, i would think.

Kate,

I know that was messed up decision but heh I was messed up.  Fortunately 
the e I bought was from my friend(sort of).  I am going to try to quit 
taking drugs now.  And I will never trip again.  Perhaps it was a good 
thing that I had a bad trip experience.

you could say it like that, or you could say that raving (and it's
anemnities) easily push themselves to the forefront of your attention and
push things that really should be important to you out of the way.  like
school, family, friends who don't listen to techno, hygene, etc.

Well, I plan on posting a behind the scenes look at IGC in the next day or so,
but as for now I'm still clearing up a few minor details (a promoter's work is
never done).  I'll just say briefly though, WOW.

I'm writing now, taking a long shot and asking if anyone has any ideas on who
was responsible for the graffiti on the table in the back of the second room
(near the bathrooms) and in one of the stalls in the br.  The table had "Smart"
written all over it and the tag in the stall was, well...a tag.

I was very proud of the way the group as a whole conducted itself at the Ice
Garden.  The owner (who had doubts beforehand) was pleasantly suprised,
actually.  This artwork was the only majorly destructive thing that was done
there and did cost me a portion of the security deposit.  I just thought I'd
take a stab at finding out who's responsible.  If nothing else I can lecture
them on the disadvantages of upsetting a venue owner who's only other rave
knowledge has come from 60 Minutes.

This kind of thing leads to:
Harsher searching next time leading to longer waits at the door
Lack of cooperation from venue owners who can't take the chance of their
property being destroyed
The raising of rental costs leading to the raising of ticket prices
Deterioration of the skin on Rich's fingertips from scrubbing every imaginable
cleansing product onto the bathroom door's surface

All of these things should be kept in mind the next time someone wants to
mention the unreasonable ticket prices these days.  Perhaps it's an incentive
for all of us to take a look at our surroundings when we rave.  If someone is
spotted disrespecting another person or the space you're paying to party in, do
something about it.  It worked with the crazy shoving maniac in the main room.
He spent the night in jail because everyone banned together.

Well, I'm going on too long about this.  I promise all of the fun gossipy
goodies soon.  I just had to make my point.  We're all responsible for the
preservation of the scene.  Do your part!  If it means being a tattler, no
sweat.  It will help significantly in the end.

and also to whoever had the nerve/ingenuity to spin the beastie boys' "intergalactic" into their set....it was done masterfully and i thought it was highly appropriate....

just glad i didn't hear it over and over all nite which i could swear could be said for one rekkid that i seemed to find in most of what i heard that nite....my friends said the same, but none of us could id it...oh well.

i totally got the same vibe from time to time....usually they would check out my face....check my hat (the top hat for those that keep forgetting)...then look me up one side and down the other and just sort of give that snotty sniff that you'd expect of a stereotypical brit or french person (i know both IRL and love them so if there are any on here, please don't take offense)...it just made me suspicious and feel the need to watch my back....i dunno....

you mean there were other bathrooms?!?!?!?  and to think i spent a good quantity of time trying to wade through the almost constant flow of people coming out of the main room near the men's pisser....which not surprisingly...quickly turned co-ed

as for the group pics...i want one too if copies are being made....i'll even pay for processeing and postage and all that jazz...just let me know who has one for me

also...kelly...i saw you running around but never got a chance to officially meet you...i just want you to know...i had 4 friends there who had never been to a pittsburgh party (two from columbus, one from buffalo who hits toronto alot, my boy who used to own the ice garden..and well...myself) and one who is a regular in the area...all of us had a kick ass time...all my friends wanted to make sure that i/we are informed of any other parties you and rich throw together....

rich...mad props....i'd have loved to have met you....sorry i missed you there but keep up the awesome work.....

if you guys or anyone needs to get some flyers out in the NW PA area...feel free to drop me a line....i'll do whatever i can

Hey_You

Hells yeah :) I much prefer my angel wings though to my sequined gown. They
are much more conducive to dancing ;)

Hi kids, this is going to be a little uncharacteristic of a post for me,
seeing as how I usually don't share much of my personal life via computer
(well, unless it's with Max, but that's besides the point...and I think I have
scared him a bit anyways ;) But here goes, if this little tid-bit of my life
has any sort of positive effect on *anyone*....then I am happy to tell....

Well, I went to Family Affair and didn't have the greatest of times, but
didn't have the worst of times either. I mean, my boyfriend lost a lot of
money when he got taken on those bunk doves and what have you, but things got
better after Friday night, or so I thought. But I'll cut most of that
out....since this really doesn't have to do so much with the party itself.
Well, I had a decent time mostly because of the kids I camped out with. Three
really good friends of mine and Joe's (Joe's my boyfriend) that we had driven
down with were staked out right next to us and we all had a great time
together. Since the party though, I hadn't talked to them until this past
Saturday.

See, everything was normal after the party, but I had just been really busy
and had been working a lot and didn't get around to visiting them. Anyways, so
I went and got my pictures developed from Family Affair and I thought that
this was a more than appropriate reason to stop by their house and see what
was up and share the pics with them. When I got there, I got more than I
bargained for. I found out that one of the girls I went with has been in the
psychiatric ward at the local hospital for a week now. Apparently, she took
too much acid and wigged out. I mean, I am sure that her long duration of
heavy drug use didn't help much, but it was finally the acid that set her off.
She took something like 10 sugar cubes in one day. Yikes. Now she's lost. She
acts pretty normal when I go to visit her, but she makes up these realities in
her head. She thinks everyone is in on a conspiracy, she really thinks she is
some huge raving super-star promoter (she has never promoted before) and she's
convinced of all this other crazy stuff that has never happened. It's really
weird. And what's worse, I know this sounds hilarious, I mean even I chuckled
when I heard some of the things she had managed to come up with in her head,
but now it's not just a crazy, funny trip anymore...it's her life. She's stuck
in the hospital and on lithium and all kinds of weird stuff (although she says
she is going to refuse to take their medicine anymore). Listen, the only
reason I am telling you guys any of this is because I know we all (well most
of us) think that nothing like this is ever going to happen to us or to anyone
we know. I mean, I know I never thought that! Yeah, I have heard all kinds of
horror stories about things...Joe knows some kid who he went to high school
with that tried to kill himself by downing a whole bottle of liquid LSD and
didn't realize that the stuff wouldn't kill him, but just make him crazy, and
the kid has spent the last seven years locked in a rubber room thinking he is
a small animal. I mean, those stories all sound so far-fetched and
untouchable. It never seems real until something bad happens close to home, to
someone you know. At least it never seemed that way to me. I just wanted to
share this in the hopes that maybe it would make someone think twice before
they dose. I'm *not* dissing acid, or people who take it...like I said, I know
these bad things are the minority of occurances, but I just don't want to see
any more of my kids get hurt....or hear any more horror stories, even if they
don't hit that close to home. 

Just think twice kids. Too many kids at parties don't think about what they
are putting in their bodies...some don't even know WHAT it is! IF you want to
experiment, do your reasearch and take the consqeuences into consideration.
Just please be careful kids. Believe it or not, I care about all my fellow
party kids out there...and I don't want to see drugs destroy this scene which
has brought us all together.

created a biochemical pathway in the auditory center of my cerebral
cortex one day.  this pathway is usually plugged up with some other
chemical when he's not activating it.  this exists so as to not waste
neurotransmitters, fats, and steroids.  two days ago, it was
activated...that's all i have to say.  also, i would like to be known as
the cranial crusader from now on.

neuroscience

A large part of the human cortex, the frontal area, is used for
awareness, intelligence, and memory. For example, after a sensation,
such as visualizing a new object, is recorded, the memory is stored for
a short term (or more permanently) within nerve cells in the brain. When
the object is seen again, the memory is recalled and the object is
recognized. That an elderly person can often recall many highly
complicated memories from early childhood is an example of the
remarkable power of the brain's storage process. Today neuroscientists
are actively studying the cellular mechanism by which nerve cells store
memories. One theory is that a change occurs in the ribonucleic acid, or
RNA, in the cells of the cortex to code the memory trace in the brain's
protein material. Another theory is that peptides (hormonelike
substances) in the brain are activated as an event is being stored as a
memory. A third theory is that neurotransmitters (chemicals that relay
nerve impulses between two or more neurons) are altered as impulses are
stored.

end neuroscience

can't get over how much fun that was.  we (people that rave) will truly
not know what we have until we are lifted out of the
rave-culture-hyper-immersion bath.  tomorrow i will be visiting my PCP
to have my legs x-rayed...thanks alot kelly and rich! =]

well, i've been into techno/house/electronica/jungle/hardcore/trip
hop/acid house/.............. etc, etc, etc.. for a long time now, and
my cousin (he is from Enland) used to be a big raver in the UK...  I'd
visited him a couple of times and seen all these amazing flyers and
heard stories, and it just seemed like a scene i'd like to get into...
then i found this mailing list and figgured, "what am i waiting for?"
and decided I'd dive in as soon as i got to school...

> > in any case, i'm up in mass for the next couple weeks,

> Kewl.... my sis (age24) lives in Boston
yeah.. i'm outside of Boston in Worcester... (about 45min-1hr west)... 
not any kind of rave scene in Worcester, although I hear that there's a
pretty good one in Boston...

cool... it would be much easier to know in advance...  i heard about a
rave or 2 last year while i was at school, but it was like the night of
and they were in Cleveland, so it just never happened...

this is great..  i'm really psyched about all the positive feedback i've
gotten in less than 24hours from my post...  i'm really looking forward
to getting back to pittsburgh and getting to know all you guys...

peace..

     do you know? i just re-read it, and laughed myself
     silly. stream of consciousness alert! but really, 
     it hardly does justice to what has to have been one
     of the most confused, paranoid, yet nonetheless 
     wonderful experiences of my life so far. this is 
     why i go to parties. they overload my brain...

     'life is too simple, therefore i rave.'

     plus, it justifies my totally bleached hair. 'why
     d'ya do it?' 'oh, to fit in...'

 Just wondering...What did you find wrong with DG? I thought
 it was a great time. Good location, good music, good lights, good
 vibe, good party. Didn't notice any negative reviews at the time.
 What didn't you like?
 
 -Az
  >>

i didn't write original mesage here, but:
dg was good.  good music, decent vibe, plenty of space, BUT:
it had NO RUNNING WATER!
  my lucky ass brought a half gallon of water in and i shared it with some
(greatly 
  apreciative) friends, but i couldn't refill and thus drank less than i
should have.  i
  heard someone faked a seizure to (succesfully) get free water from the
vendors.  
  it disgusts me to think that anyone throwing a dance/physical
activity/anything at 
  all would deny free water.  this (and free oxygen and place to pee, both of
which 
  dg had) is the basics
it had NO CHILL AREA!
  with music so loud, it's approaching unsafe hee, too, to not have a quiet
chill area
  plus, we all like meeting each other at raves.  it's nice to smile and wave,
but
  talking with ease is much better
the FLLOR WAS DIRTY CONCRETE
  i personal don't just dance on my feet.  i dance on my hands, my knees, even
my 
  back and anus.  this was quite difficult at dg.  the floor got my nice
yellow pants 
  all dirty and scuffed my shoes a lot.  at igc, for example, the floor was
smooth 
  and i could even spin around in circles on my knees without getting bruises.
the SECURITY DUDES ROAMING AROUND DIDN'T SMILE
  they gave me the feeling that they had an eye on me, and i should watch what
i 
  was doing.  this isn't terrible, but i sure liked the security at igc
better: token cops
  (who seemed nice enough, even if they did sport wack ass uniforms) and then 
  friendly big people (one of whom, Walt, i was already friends with from
previous 
  encounters)
the DECOR WAS UNCREATIVE
  if i remember correctly, there was little in the way of decoration.  there
should
  have been much in the way of decoration.  i don't need to even start about
igc.

don't get me wrong, i still had a sloppy good time at dg, but it came more
from within than from ?without?

i love what you do for me,

For those of you who were having a discussion on how to cure the
"after e blues" a few days ago, I thought this part of an article I
found might be of interest.  Especially because someone suggested
taking prozac as a possible cure for the "after e blues."

Just trying to help,
Josh 

 check your physical condition. MDMA puts serious strain on the
body.  Before taking it try to be healthy and rested. Your heart,liver
and kidneys all have to work harder. Avoid taking  MDMA if you are on
anti-depressants.  Your mental health is important also.

Don't have a ton of time so 'm keeping this brief.

Great party.  Nice production, above all.  Props to downlow.  Aside from
the graf shennaigans I hope it went all right.  Sounds like it did.  I
suppose my opinion was coloured by chemicals but I really liked the music
the lights, the space, the vibe was really great.  Much better than DC. 
Everytime I go out here, I get a little pissed off because people are so
stuck up.  Sure there are a few pretentious people in pgh-cle but even
most of the fashion obsessed types don't have their head up their ass. 
They just enjoy getting all dressed up and can still give smiles and get
down.  The sound was a bit rough in the main room.  Too much bass tended
to drown out the mids and make the highs sound tinny.  I think the
plexiglass made it really difficult to have good full sound anywhere but
in the middle.  It was refreshing to hear so much funky breaks and no
boring steppers (not to dis all you jungle heads, but I just get sick of
hard/tech/etc step).  I love smartie.  we left during his set.  Why
doesn't he get booked at more parties?  I guess some people don't like his
goofy eclectic style.  Not traditional rave music.  Welp, I had a great
time.  Met a bunch of people.  You know who you are.  Hopefully I will be
around next week for Life is but a Dream.  I have one question.  Does
anyone know the name of that old song that uses a sample of what sounds
like huge truck driving by at a high speed?

BWWWWAAAAAAAAAARRRRRrrrrrrrwwwwww.....

On Tuesday July 28th, Pittsburgh industrial heroes Mindless Faith will be
performing live at 9:30pm at The Pollinator (above the Oakland Beehive).

Following the performance will be Digital, the weekly
electronica/industrial night which I DJ (dj -brian); there will be a
special guest DJ as well.

If you would like to attend, I have a number of FREE PASSES (bearer + 1
guest) available. I can drop them in the mail to you, or meet you in
person in the Oakland area of Pittsburgh.  I can also probably arrange to
put you on the guest list if you'd like.

Unfortunately, this is a 21+ event.  =(

Email me for details or passes.

hello party kids
just wanted to say i had a great time at igc...i danced my ass 
off..either due to do my mental state, pms or being slipped some whack 
shit or a combination of all three...i was not my normal smiley, huggy 
self..i sort of made it to the net met and then i tweeked..then i came 
back and i was the girlie with the short brown hair and blue tank top 
that took the group picture with spike's camera..i met a few kids but 
just couldn't deal with that well lit snack bar area at all during the 
night..also just thought i'd let you know that i believe it was 
mcdonald's mayor McCheese in the main room by the dj...despite my own 
personal drama at the party..it was phat as hell..take care all
little sarah

I could swear, at some random point during the evening, that for just one
minute, while the dj had his back turned looking for the next record, 
Mayor McCheese stepped to the decks and just *cutup*.  Anyone have the
booking info on the mayor? :)

out of curiosity i hit the faq's myself, and here's
what i found...

[from www.hyperreal.org/drugs/faqs/FAQ-LSD]...

<<Spinal taps are not particularly useful (cerebro-spinal 
fluid doesn't concentrate LSD or metabolites) and are never 
done under any circumstances: they are painful and dangerous.>>

the most obvious response is that a dead individual is not likely
to complain of neither pain nor danger...in addition this is a 
quote from a very much outdated post on alt.drugs from a chemistry
student and not a not a neurologist...more recent studies 
specifically those of 'flashbacks' (an undeniable symptom of 
frequent lsd users) and mdma  detection through spinal taps (which 
in turn started the urban myth that mdma does damage to the nerves, 
when in reality it was the spinal taps themselves that did nerve 
damage) significantly refute this...

<< 1] How long can LSD be detected in the body?
This varies by the test being used, the detection limit placed 
on the test,the point of collection and type of the sample fluid, 
the amount of LSD that was taken, and the individual in question.
Assuming the testers are using an RIA screening test with the 
cutoff set at 0.1 ng/ml and assuming that the user has recently 
emptied their bladder, then the detection limit for one hit (100 
ug) is normally around 30 hours. Each doubling of the initial 
amount will add about 5 hours.  Thus taking 8 hits will leave a 
user vulnerable for approximately 2 days.  (NOTE: This is based on 
the data in [7])
 2] What exact form of test can be used to detect LSD in the body?  
There are a number of tests which can be used to detect LSD in the 
body. Abuscreen, a product of Roche Diagnostic Systems, is a series 
of RadioImmunoAssay (RIA) tests, one of which is used to detect LSD 
and its metabolites in whole blood, serum (blood), urine and stomach contents
[1].
RIA can in theory be used to detect quantities as small as 0.020 
nanograms (ng) per milliliter (ml) of sample [2].  Laboratory tests 
have shown that RIA results are accurate down to at least 0.1 ng/ml 
[3].  The manufacturer recommends limiting the cutoff to 0.5 ng/ml.
EMIT, a product of Syva Corporation, is another series of tests, 
one of which can be used to detect LSD and its metabolites in serum 
and urine. EMIT stands for Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique.
Both EMIT and Abuscreen are "positive/negative" response tests (much 
like
pregnancy tests) which require periodic equipment calibration and 
consume chemicals for each test performed.  A basic battery of tests 
costs approx. $15-$25 per person [4].  The basic tests (recommended 
by NIDA) include marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and phencyclidine
(PCP).
Normally, unless an (employer) specifically requests the test, an 
LSD assay is not run.
Both Roche and Syva recommend confirmation of positive results by 
using a different test.  The usual method of confirming positive 
results is some form of chromatography.  These include High 
Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC)[3], and different 
forms of Gas Chromatography/MassSpectrometry (GC/MS)[5][6][7][8][9].
HPTLC and GC/MS can be used to give quantitative results as opposed 
to the Boolean results from EMIT or Abuscreen.  Laboratory tests 
have shown that GC/MS test for LSD in urine[6] and blood[7] can be 
accurate down to 0.1 ng/ml.  The cost for confirmation of a positive
screening test is approximately $50-60. Positive results to either 
EMIT and RIA are held to be "probable cause" by U.S. courts.  GC/MS 
results are held to be "proof" by U.S. courts>>

Ok, i think I have finally cooled down from the blast furnace known as
igc. Props to downlow who kept everything in order and the RostRaver
township just for the fact of their cool name. Upon intial entry I saw a
cackling freak with an unusually extended tounge! Funny! Big Boy and the
Mayor brought smiles to my face as I started to work it on the floor
before things got too crowded.
    I had a somewhat smiliar experience to DaKebbler Elf, but twas all
good just a bit of a suprise :)  It helped me get into the circus mood
dancing within my hand crafted ring of Life is But a Dream flyers which
actually hallped made some people notice and pick up some!
 Shouts out to all those at the netmeet and hopefully the pb-cle bades
didnt melt away before exiting.  Someday Il get that right :)  Anyways a
great party and hope to be back in full effect for LIBAD!

   For those of you who dont know WED Night at laga is reserved for those
moody cranky goths.  For those of you who havent paid attention some new
goth music is actually quite danceable and fun/trancey though in their own
pretensious way they call it ebm aka electonic based music. (If it sounds
like techno, its techno kids)  Tomorrow Angstboy wil be a special DJ along
with Brian Parker and here is a summary:

>I will be spinning with DJ brian for a night of non-stop dance music.
>No goth crap
>No swirly changing the lightbulb music
>Just 4 hours of dance beating, booty-shaking music.
>So come out, wear your dancing shoes, and pace yourself.
>Angstboy
>okay, okay, we'll play a little bit of goth crap.  

So its Laga in Oakland 18+ $5 under 21, $2 over
So if you can try to make it and show those dark brooders a dance step or
two :)

hope to see yall on Friday as well,
PLUR 
jeffrey

PS glad to hear radio free carson back on the air
the heavens must be listening to the cries from the list

PPS Yeah Geoff the Mayor was doing some of that "cheesy" frankfurt happy
rave stuff, gotta love it :)

I had originally just mailed this stuff to David S., but since there
is some interest, here's some info, all from the lsd faq:

"LSD and its metabolites were still detectable in human urine for
 as long as 4 days after the ingestion of 0.2 mg of the drug.
        [Faed, E.M., McLeod, W.R.: A urine screening test of lysergide.
         Journal of Chromatographic Science.  11, 4-6 (1973)]

Note that standard, cheap initial drug screening does not use
chromatography or mass-spectrometry, and does not look for LSD.

Spinal taps are not particularly useful (cerebro-spinal fluid doesn't
concentrate LSD or metabolites) and are never done under any
circumstances: they are painful and dangerous.

 ABSTRACT  Demethylation of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the 
human has
           been demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo, and aromatic
           hydroxylation at positions 13 and 14 has been tentatively
           identified. A gas chromatography/resonance electron capture
           ionization mass spectrometry (GC/MS) assay for LSD and
           N-demethyl-LSD in urine has been developed, in which the drug 
and
           its metabolite are converted to their N-tri-fluoroacetyl 
derivatives
           prior to GC/MS analysis. Linear and reproducible calibration 
curves
           have been obtained for LSD concentrations from 0.05 to 5.0 
ng/mL,
           and for N-demethyl-LSD concentrations from 0.03 to 5.0 ng/mL. 
The
           assay was used to determine the urinary concentrations of LSD 
and
           N-demethyl-LSD following administration of a single oral dose 
of the
           drug (1 mu g/kg) to an adult volunteer. The rates of 
excretion of
           LSD and N-demethyl-LSD reached maxima in urine collected at 
time
           intervals of 4-6 and 8-10 h after administration, 
respectively. The
           elimination half-lives for LSD and N-demethyl-LSD were 3.6 
and 10.0
           h, respectively

> 1] How long can LSD be detected in the body?

This varies by the test being used, the detection limit placed on the 
test,
the point of collection and type of the sample fluid, the amount of LSD 
that
was taken, and the individual in question.

Assuming the testers are using an RIA screening test with the cutoff set 
at
0.1 ng/ml and assuming that the user has recently emptied their bladder,
then the detection limit for one hit (100 ug) is normally around 30 
hours.
Each doubling of the initial amount will add about 5 hours.  Thus taking 
8
hits will leave a user vulnerable for approximately 2 days.  (NOTE: This 
is
based on the data in [7])

> 2] What exact form of test can be used to detect LSD in the body?  
There
are a number of tests which can be used to detect LSD in the body.

Abuscreen, a product of Roche Diagnostic Systems, is a series of
RadioImmunoAssay (RIA) tests, one of which is used to detect LSD and its
metabolites in whole blood, serum (blood), urine and stomach contents 
[1].
RIA can in theory be used to detect quantities as small as 0.020 
nanograms
(ng) per milliliter (ml) of sample [2].  Laboratory tests have shown 
that
RIA results are accurate down to at least 0.1 ng/ml [3].  The 
manufacturer
recommends limiting the cutoff to 0.5 ng/ml.

EMIT, a product of Syva Corporation, is another series of tests, one of
which can be used to detect LSD and its metabolites in serum and urine.
EMIT stands for Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique.

Both EMIT and Abuscreen are "positive/negative" response tests (much 
like
pregnancy tests) which require periodic equipment calibration and 
consume
chemicals for each test performed.  A basic battery of tests costs 
approx.
$15-$25 per person [4].  The basic tests (recommended by NIDA) include
marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and phencyclidine (PCP).
Normally, unless an (employer) specifically requests the test, an LSD 
assay
is not run.

Both Roche and Syva recommend confirmation of positive results by using 
a
different test.  The usual method of confirming positive results is some
form of chromatography.  These include High Performance Thin Layer
Chromatography (HPTLC)[3], and different forms of Gas 
Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS)[5][6][7][8][9].  HPTLC and GC/MS can be used to 
give
quantitative results as opposed to the Boolean results from EMIT or
Abuscreen.  Laboratory tests have shown that GC/MS test for LSD in 
urine[6]
and blood[7] can be accurate down to 0.1 ng/ml.  The cost for 
confirmation
of a positive screening test is approximately $50-60.

Positive results to either EMIT and RIA are held to be "probable cause" 
by
U.S. courts.  GC/MS results are held to be "proof" by U.S. courts.

Okay, I got my car to make it.. found out it's the modulator that's going,
so I'm taking it to the shop tomorrow. Anyways, me an'my GF went to Horde,
yadda yadda, here's a review.

First off; concessions. Excuse me, but what the fuck is this shit with
$2.75 for a bottle of water, that they won't even gimme the fucking cap
for? yet i can get a cap with my $4 bottle of coke!? $20 for a fucking
hat!? *grumble* *snarl*

now, i'm not gonna cover everyone.. just the sets i actually paid
attention to. (didn't get much sleep last night, got woken up by fucking
storms triggering UPSes en masse. so i slept thru some sets.)

first one, is of course, barenakedladies, or bnl. any band that starts off
a set with what must have been 10,000 people on their feet (the entire
pavillion *AND* the lawn, with a HUGE crowd.), is gonna do good. fucking
loonies, i swear. they did a song about the giant eggroll people, the
burrito oasis, and de-acronymed horde for everyone. Hot Oreo Rayon
Dextrose ERECT! *grin* They finished up their set with random songs,
bouncing around popular songs, making fun of them, stuff like that. they
were all over the stage, dancing and having fun. oh, and they mentioned
sp's lead singer (i'm fried, atm) going "despite all my rage, I am still
just a WHAT THE FUCK IS WITH ALL THIS MACARONI ON THE STAGE?!" (bnl fans
know where the macaroni comes from. hundreds managed to smuggle it past
blossom security.) great fucking set. glad i was on my feet for it.

last one, and the best, without a doubt, even tho i missed most of it, was
smashing pumpkins. anyone who says that the heavy guitar riff days are
gone is a fucking moron, and should have been at the show. they opened
with two sorta-slow songs, everyone on their feet, a bigger crowd than
bnl, cheering, screaming, people on the lawn crowding against the
pavillion fences to get closer. and then they did the song that absolutely
without a doubt made my night. ava adore. but NOT the fucking radio
version, NOT the version on the CD...

this version was fucking LADEN with heavy guitar riffs, powerful singing,
and a nice jazzy interlude on a korg. they did some amazing things
musically, i was screaming for more...

...till i noticed the extremely dangerous black clouds moving in at about
40 or 50 mph. i told my gf to help me pack it in QUICK, and we made a run
for the car. we weren't alone, but it was a small group. we managed to get
to the car just before the storm let loose. it was horrible driving
through the shit. but we got out relatively quickly.. from the back
parking lot back to route 8 took us maybe 10 or 15 minutes. as soon as we
hit 8, all hell broke loose. i just now got all the damned systems in the
house booting a short while ago. had 'em down from the storms in the
morning. so i'm gonna go make sure everything booted, and go to bed. :P

	  The only thing that i have to say about the whole party is this: The
Intergalactic spotlight was shining bright and beutiful on Pittsburgh
saturday night.  That was the best party i've been to in pittsburgh in
absolutly forever. The vibe was thicker than the fog in the second room and
i was totally engulfed in it. All of you that went know what i'm talking
about, and for those of you that didn't, i'm sorry that you didn't feel the
love.  Mad props to Downlow and 5-star for keepin their shit tight and on
track. Keep up the fantastically good work guyez! shouts to all i met,
whether i remember you or not. Also, if anybody was wondering who those
drum guys were, their name us rukus. they're good friends of mine and if
anybody want's to book them, get in cotact with me and i'll get you the
info. Late!

well kiddies, 
this isnt exactly rave related...not really at all, but oh well, delete if you
will
 
on firday, the night before IGC, i went to the B-52's cpmcert and i decided i
should do small review

    first off, for the years they have behind them, there still kicking it
pretty hard, i can't say so much for the crowd though..it seemed sorta like i
was at a bad class reunion at a school i didn't attend..but i was right in the
front and everyone up there was shaking and grooving ...((plus some lady moved
her seat (and her friends') that was in the front so me and my friends could
all be right in the front, a very very nice gesture))  well anyway, i have to
say even if not everyone was grooving they were up on there feet and ready to
be blown away, and we were... 
...also some lucky kiddies won the chance to dance on the stage with the
group, and it was neat cause the one girl danced in a very noticable "rave"
style ((dare i say that))..but anyway that was neat to see
   they didn't play to long, (about 15 minutes less than the Pretenders who
were on before them, but i wasn't feeling good and had to lay down until they
were done)
    
 i have but one complaint...not enough room to really dance...i got to move
some ,but i would have loved to of really gotten to bust a move, oh well....

hehe and it was especially nice because after wards i had no traffic worries
becuase i nice stretch limo picked me and my friends up (and had taken us
there) and drove us home..hehe traveling with style, gosh i felt so spoiled,
but hey we paid out the ass for it...blah!   

well thats it, i just wanted to share my lovely evening and tomorrow i'm
heading back to cleveland to see Tori Amos *sigh* i just love her music.. it
makes me all warm and fuzzy inside :)   well anyway perhaps a review will be
due 

see everyone at SPROUTIN' if i can make it

much luv and hugs

cj bolland is also going to be appearing at the motor lounge in detroit on
friday.  that is about twice as close to most cleveland kids than cincy,
although both would be worth the trip.  cj bolland HATES flying, so this will
probably be the last time he is around for a LONG while.  i will most likely
be going down to the cincy show, that is, as long as the bar that it's in
isn't 21 and over, otherwise, i'll have to give in and go to the motor, as
much as i'd hate to =)

I like it. If you are into industrial or industrial styled techno (what 
would you call this? electro was a friends comment) then I highly 
recommoned it based on my first night.  Very layed back crowd, much more 
'open' then the laga crowd.  No offense on laga's goth/indust but it was 
always too cliqish for me. :)

Yet another party on Aug 8th.....Crystallizzzzzzzed in Cleveland. I'll be
there. Anybody else going please send to the list and we can hopefully meet up
there or call pool if anybody's close. Sorry, I don't have the flyer with me
(can't post the info line, but will later). I know Kevin Cunningham and DJ
Urban are doing a tag team set and the sound is by Midnight Blue (my friend
works for them). Also...first 250 people get free CDs, tapes, etc....
		I'll send more when I get my flyer back or if anyone else has the info,
please send it to the list.

-matt

P.S. BTW, I'm new to the list (started yesterday-->tuesday). Thanks for makin
me welcome and hopefully I'll meet some of you kidz at a party real soon.

EBM (usually an acronym for Electronic Body Music) doesn't really have
it's roots in goth.  It's definitely a techno derivative, but it's not
even new; bands like Front 242 and Nitzer Ebb were doing "EBM" back when
most of us were learning fractions.

(So what does EBM have to do with goth?  Good question.  Many consider EBM
a form of "industrial," a broad genre usually coupled with goth music to
form "gothic/industrial" dance nights like Ceremony.  Why industrial is
often coupled with goth music is a whole 'nother post...)

Personally I've always found wed @ laga to be tres fun - no more
pretensious for "non goths" than scj is for "non ravers" - as if anyone
can really fit into them catagories 100%.  If you go to enjoy yourself,
you will have fun. Lots of dancable ebm and industrial, plus lately alot 
of 'industrial' artists are blending of techno and breaks elements into
their tunes.  So don't worry if you're timid about what you're gonna hear.

I'd say the major difference that I find on wed is that kids tend to get
up and dance for songs they know/like, and socialize otherwize. You get
that *some* i suppose at techno nights, (no doubt i make some noise when i
hear a fav tune, and sit/chat for stuff that bores me) but there i think
its more based on if the dj's runnin' things rather than specific
selections.

Now that i think of it, he did have those big, white gloves....:)

Sorry to say Radio Carson doesn't broadcast real audio.

I love radio carson to death, but i must say, usually they aren't playing
anything all that amazing that you couldn't hear on some other real-audio
broadcast.  However, I'd say just for their mixshows alone it would be
worth it to set up an RA broadcast.  I haven't been in touch with Mark in
a while, so i don't know the feasibility of such a thing...someone would
probably have to donate the software.

No, Lift isn't 21 and over, it's 18 and over, but they have to take your ID at
the door if you're under 21 :) I think Bob ran into a little trouble one week
because he wasn't supposed to let kids who are under 21 stay after 2 and when
the 5-0 walked in they gave tickets to everyone under 21 and to Bob too :)
ANYWAYS, anyone who is heading down to Cincy tomorrow lemme know...I'll see

*everyone* in Cincy that night...it's a Friday. Lest you forget, it's the
night of the CBS party "Sensual" which offers the talents of Jam Master Jay to
entertain you. Not only that, it just *happens* to be my 21st birthday :)
Hopefully, everyone can head down and celebrate with me!

I suppose that's all well and good, except for that fact that many of us
can't get into the Pollinator!  By the way, I'll be 20 tomorrow.  I'm a
little bitter that I won't be 21.

'Lo all,
Lately I noticed some stuff going on here that hasn't been mentioned on
the list.  tonight at mit is an electronic gig w/ solex & the golden arm
trio.  solex sounds like a danceable idm type thing & golden arm trio is
described as a jazzy non-electronic group.  There's more info in today's
In Pittsburgh.  I think I saw a flyer for this show at the corner of
Forbes & Murray.  I was in a car so I couldn't catch all the details but
I think it said that Solex is from Amsterdam.
	In Pittsburgh also has a write-up on LIBAD & 1.8.7(in separate
places).  It's kind of interesting considering their usual apathy
towards the rave scene.  If all that's not enough they have a write-up
about an upcoming hip-hop show at rosebud tommorow at 5.  It's a few
rappers from a newly formed local label called Gemini Records.  It's
over-21.
	Lastly, if anyone's into Crystal Method I saw their name listed on the
sign outside Metropol yesterday.  Pollstar doesn't have them listed here
yet but they play a gig in cleveland the 18th so I assume it'll be
around that time.

     the crystal method are playing at metropol on
     the ninth of september. i have to assume they'll
     be promoting their new CD (which i haven't gotten
     a copy of yet, to my great annoyance) which is
     supposed to come out on the 24th of august.

     they were one of the 'big names' that were going
     to headline the crane before that all went down
     the tubes. since the crane is under renovation to
     become (perhaps) a massive club venue they have
     to play at metropol.

     as far as i know tickets will be $16 or so. that's
     all for now from the geekboy...

Ok, i think I have finally cooled down from the blast furnace known as
igc. Props to downlow who kept everything in order and the RostRaver
township just for the fact of their cool name. Upon intial entry I saw a
cackling freak with an unusually extended tounge! Funny! Big Boy and the
Mayor brought smiles to my face as I started to work it on the floor
before things got too crowded.
    I had a somewhat smiliar experience to DaKebbler Elf, but twas all
good just a bit of a suprise :)  It helped me get into the circus mood
dancing within my hand crafted ring of Life is But a Dream flyers which
actually hallped made some people notice and pick up some!
 Shouts out to all those at the netmeet and hopefully the pb-cle bades
didnt melt away before exiting.  Someday Il get that right :)  Anyways a
great party and hope to be back in full effect for LIBAD!

   For those of you who dont know WED Night at laga is reserved for those
moody cranky goths.  For those of you who havent paid attention some new
goth music is actually quite danceable and fun/trancey though in their own
pretensious way they call it ebm aka electonic based music. (If it sounds
like techno, its techno kids)  Tomorrow Angstboy wil be a special DJ along
with Brian Parker and here is a summary:

>I will be spinning with DJ brian for a night of non-stop dance music.
>No goth crap
>No swirly changing the lightbulb music
>Just 4 hours of dance beating, booty-shaking music.
>So come out, wear your dancing shoes, and pace yourself.
>Angstboy
>okay, okay, we'll play a little bit of goth crap.  

So its Laga in Oakland 18+ $5 under 21, $2 over
So if you can try to make it and show those dark brooders a dance step or
two :)

hope to see yall on Friday as well,
PLUR 
jeffrey

PS glad to hear radio free carson back on the air
the heavens must be listening to the cries from the list

PPS Yeah Geoff the Mayor was doing some of that "cheesy" frankfurt happy
rave stuff, gotta love it :)

If anyone's gonna see CJ Bolland later today lets set up a place and time
to meet at elevation...

i plan on being there around 10:30, which is an hour before CJ will play
and that should allow plenty of time...

anyone else have any ideas?????

                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including Buffalo
in the ROM, as well as some somewhat related concert events, just testing
this out and we'll see what the reactions are....

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your
bookmarks appropriately.

Submissions, flames, threats, and your credit card numbers to:

   [1]trout@hyperreal.org


please dont send to my other addresses, as i dont check them much, if at
all.  and PLEASE NO TABS IN THE TEXT!!!  it makes formatting a bitch.

  the sound throughout the night will have both balance and progression,
  so you can always choose between two styles, or experience a flow of
  sound (dub-dancehall-jungle-hardcore-techno-trance-house).  There will
  definitely be some music you don't hear at every rave - both slow and
  fast tempos - but it will all be good.

  including toy prizes, free fruit, face painting, as well as other drinks
  (not alcohol) candy and water ($1) will be for sale.

  (more is better) people in your vehicle.  we'll also be setting up some
  kind of carpool or shuttle.  leave a message on our line or email us
  (pbsproductions@hotmail.com) if you're interested in this.

  one thing we want to let everyone know: this event is about nothing more
  than having a good time, and grooving to the music!  have phun, but
  be responsible.  this music and culture are special -  we don't want it
  commodified and sold as a product. please respect the space and
  don't tag. don't bring drugs, weapons or ill attitudes.
  thanks to all the folks who've helped us this far - you're great!

  If you have any questions or comments,
   email us: pbsproductions@hotmail.com,

Its kind of funny how it says with Solex you have to use your 'mind and
your body for full enjoyment' (paraphrase)?  What does that mean really?
Are the mind and body not always totally intertwined in experience?

Note:  All of these articles (LIBAD, 187, and the hiphop thing) were
written by Csilla, whom you may know as the Instigator's wife.  She's very
cool and nice...its a good sign for electro-kids getting at least a bit of
coverage in inpgh.

[David Schwanke]  Most definitly not. I have had out of body experiences 
(or more technically astral projections as in the 'other world' was most 
probably not this one called earth).  Unless of course you count the idea 
of loosing touch with your body completely as also part of the 'bodily' 
experience.

Colour me stupid but is there anything going on in pittsburgh this evening 
bar/club releated with techno? I had thought the pollinator had techno 
tonight but the guy on the beehives phone said it was funk/hiphop. When IS 
the pollinator techno night? I think the weekly thing on hyperreal said 
sunday.

You dudes know somethin,?  Sometimes I can just go out of the house 
looking fine, and suddenly darken someone day BY JUST BEING THERE.
It isn't any shades of grey with me.  You are going to like me right 
away or hate me right away.  That is just the way it is.  

My dad got this issue of Air and Space magazine ok.  And it shows you 
all different sizes of planes.  From models to real. And here among 
these sharp pointy brite painted planes, and the cute brite little ones, 
is this BIG BLACK OMINOUS AIRPLANE STICKING ITS BIG NOSE INTO THE 
CIRCLE.  hmmmmm.  I wonder if it feels like me?  I mean THERE IT IS!  
You either like it or you don't.  Some people think the little planes 
are cute.  Some people think the brite painted fighters are the way to 
go.  I LIKE THE BIIIG THING!  I admit it.

Oh, well.  And there is another thing too. Sometimes I Like To Darken A 
Meanie Persons day!  It can be very fun!  I think ha ha ha!  I ruined 
your day by being here.  Boo hoo.  GET OVER IT!
Peace out, DJ K.A.L.I.

The place to be would be ATOMIC @ Metropol.
Dj Sun, Saint, 7-Up and Product 19.

Its 18+ $5, 21+ $3.  Lights by Electrolite FX.  
It was very cool the last time i was there.

Pollinator's got house on Sat & Sun, and electronica/industrial on tues.
I think maybe the Attic or Upstage has newwave/techno/industrial on thurs,
but i'm not 100% sure, so don't quote me or anything.

just wanted to let everyone know about our website:
http://www.elevatorrecords.com

We are putting all of our top picks on the site, with streaming real audio of everything.  We've got
about 30 or 40 records up right now, and a few mixCDs, and we will have over 200 items within a
month.

Big mixtapes section coming soon (if you're a dj and would like to get a tape on our site, just send
us one.)

enjoy!  and if you like what you see, please pass the word.

thanks,
David :)

for example:

"Lately, young people have a new method for smoking marijuana: they slice open
cigars and replace the tobacco with marijuana, making what's called a "blunt."
When the blunt is smoked with a 40 oz. bottle of malt liquor, it is called a
"B-40."

Enjoy!

what's that shit that you be smoking?

hi all,
      as promised the interview i did with MTV is up now on their site.
if you want to check it out, go to mtv.com and click on Local.
then choose Philadelphia or Pittsburgh from the map (it's up on both)
and finally click on the Word.

i think that the Amp guys might include it in their feature
with the exclusive tracks as well...

take care,
jordana

I dunno -- I actually found it quite informative.  I think our precious 
children should know that acid is cut with PCP and that ecstasy is a 
*hallucinogen* that causes powerful sensory 'distortions.'

well i went to see Tori Amos, and if ya dont care to hear about it...delete
now

  it was amazing...it truely was, every single person was completely
transfixed by her...its the only concert i've ever been to where the crowd is
actually quiet during the songs, so they can hear it perfectly...then goes
absolutely crazy when she's done
   also, for the performance, she did a special two songs with out the band
with her for the first time on this tour, ever.   it was interesting, and i do
believe the beauty of the songs brought over half the place to tears    
   also during one of the songs, i cant remember which, there was a complete
storm of bubbles released down onto the stage, it was so neat!  oh well, i
just love bubbles so i had to share....
   afterwards we did the typical 'fan' thing and waited for her to come out,
and of course it started raining monkeys, and i didnt' get to see her...well i
saw her hands as she drove by...it was odd, i've never bothered to do anything
like that before, and i can't say that i would again....you just end up seeing
all the psyco obsessed people that are to rude to let you see, than actually
seeing the person you want to...blah!   oh well
    oh, and i ended up running into several party kids there, which was a nice
surprise,
    welp, i'm tired, so thats all ....its not a rave but its music baby!

Hey - I'm more than a bit biased (being the promoter), but I'll go out on
a limb and say that tonight is gonna be a blast! ;)

We've got:
           Lots of Jungle+surprize MCs and Hardcore.
           Djs who've never been here (technostate crew, marcus, pimp d)
           Up and Coming Djs (da mofo, circuit 6, craig k, andrew)
           Oldskool jungle/hardcore sets from DCypol + 187
           3 Areas of Sound, 
             with the main area by Wizard W + Electrolite FX
           Lots of wacky fun prizes.
           A live set from the Instigator.
           Great locals in Product 19, Instigator, Original Bubbles.
           An inflatable wrench.

The space isn't that big.  If you went to planet bass, i think you
remember the smaller space made for a close,  intense vibe (think
starchild's set).  So come out earlier the better - hope to see you
there. :)

the archives on the www site will be revamped.  i'm going to use mHonArc

some problems or outages while the script is being rewritten.  plus some
links anyone might have to messages or indices there might be broken in the
process....

July 23 1998:

To all techno & house supporters:

**Please note, this is the first time we have done a MAJOR email of this
kind. If you are on this list and do not want to be, or if you have
received multiple copies of this notice, please send an email to
bevmay@techno.ca **thanks and we are sorry for any inconvenience this may
have caused**

Greetings all, just a little note to let you all know what is happening
with house & techno in Toronto & about a new book on the American roots of
house & techno in the works.
RITUAL events are mentioned first in this mail; the book, FUTURE JAZZ, is
mentioned second.

********************

RITUAL in Toronto has four major events coming up:

RITUAL 3: Integration, A Planet E Evening, takes place THIS UPCOMING
WEEKEND on Saturday July 25 in Toronto and features Carl Craig Live as
Paperclip People as well as Moodymann Djing and locals the full live
7-person funk-house band the Zen Brothers, Dj Split, Dj Eric Downer, Dj
Adam Marshall, Drummer Elad'n, and in the Loading Lounge Djs Jason Palma &
Paul E Lopes spinning together.
This unforgettable night will be the first time Carl plays live in Toronto,
and his set is highly anticipated after such memorable moments as the Ovum
party in Miami in March. Moodymann is welcomed back after a brief stint
here 1 1/2 years ago, long before the stellar norotiety of his Planet E
album. The Zen Brothers are upcoming talent to watch in Toronto in a
similar vein to Sylk 130-- live jazz-influcenced, band-oriented funk &
house, with touches of Drum & Bass. A moody, deep and groovy tech-house
night to be had by all.
RITUAL 3 will be held at Industry Nightclub, 901 King St W. Infolines: 416.
760.3281 Ritual, 416.260.2660 Industry. Tickets are $15 adv., $20 @ door
and the event is 19+ licensed LLBO. Ritual 3 runs from 10pm-8am. Tix are
available at: Rotate This, Play De Record, Speed, Uncle Otis, Traxx,
Eastern Bloc & Ragtag Fairview.

RITUAL 4: Submission takes place the FOLLOWING WEEKEND on Saturday August 1
-- Caribana long weekend in Toronto-- and features Autechre Live, Richie
Hawtin as DJ with 909 & effects, Theorem Live and locals the Subtonic
Monks, an 8-piece acoustic world drumming ensemble, drummer Elad'n, and Djs
Algorhythm & Lotus, as well as video & installation art by Optical
Assembly, Simon Cowling, Curtis MacDonald, Jubal Brown & Dan Driscoll.
This will be the first set by Autechre in Toronto in over 2 years and
heralds their new album, 'Album', which is out now in Europe on WARP but
will be out in North America in a few months, when Autechre return to 'do'
America. Canada, as usual, is ahead of the game. The last time Autechre
played Toronto at Transcendance 'live' in March '96, their set was heralded
as the dawning of a new era and an inspiration for many local new producers
today. Ae are joined by the return of Richie Hawtin, ever a Toronto techno
favourite, who is also on tour for his album 'Consumed', out now on
Mute/M_nus. Rich will continue on his trend of embellishing his DJ sets
with elaborate use of effects and the powerful 909.
Ritual 4 will be held at a legal licensed concert venue TBA, but which is
quite small. Tickets are expected to sell out in advance and we advise
early arrival. Live acts begin at MIDNIGHT sharp. Please call 416.760.3281
for more info on location, etc. Tickets are $25 adv. and this event is also
19+ licensed LLBO before 2:45 am. Ritual 4 runs from 10pm-8 am. Tix are
available at: Traxx, Play de Record, Speed, Record Peddler, Speed
Kitchener, Mudshark Guelph, From Mars London, Record Time Detroit, Hidden
Jungle Missisauga, Record Bar Oshawa & Play de Scarborough.

RITUAL 5 is proud to be a part of the 1998 JVC URBAN RHYTHM FESTIVAL, which
takes place in Toronto from Wednesday, August 26-Saturday August 29 1998
and is a subset of the world-reknowned JVC Jazz Festival (think NEWPORT for
example). The Urban Rhythm Festival (formerly known as the Acid Jazz Groove
Festival) is the funkier, groovier, MUCH hipper arm of the Toronto Jazz
festival and is being co-promoted this year by Beverly May of Ritual,
Carlos Mondesir of HotStepper, Denise Benson of Tommygrl & Jonathan Ramos
of REMG Productions. This year's festival will highlight house, techno,
drum & bass, dub, hip hop,R&B, acid jazz & funk.
On Wed. August 26, Urban Rhythm has an opening party @ the Guvernment
Skybar with locals Gerald Belanger, Denise Benson, and more. $5.
On Thurs. August 27, Urban Rhythm in conjunction with Uncle Otis Clothing
present 'Drum & Bass Meets Tabla & Turntables' with the Untouchable
Outcaste Beats Tour featuring Badmarsh & Shri, as well as DJ EASE from
Nightmares on Wax performing an 'official' NOW DJ set, and local D&B moguls
Marcus, Guru Prasad & Sassa'le. A lot has been heard through the grapevine
over here about this 'Asian Underground' thing going on in London, but this
is the first time Toronto will be able to experience it. As one of the most
ethnically diverse cities in the world with a vast South Asian population,
this evening is sure to be memorable and different.
On Friday August 28, Urban Rhythm 'Funk Funk Funks it Up' with FIRST a FREE
party at Harbourfront featuring Pucho, Liquid Soul & the Greyboy Allstars
performing those latin jazz classics in a rare Toronto appearance. Later
that night, a Talkin' Loud party happens at Bauhaus with an even rarer Dj
set by Gilles Peterson as well as resident Jason Palma.
On Saturday, August 29, 'The Funk Hits the Fan' with our blowout gig
featuring the full 15- piece SYLK 130 LIVE as well as King Britt Djing,
Fred Everything from Montreal, DJ J-Dub from Chicago & local house DJ Split
with members of the Zen Bros. and local funk-hip-hop monthly, Bump & Hustle
featuring Panic, Divine Earth Essence, Mike Tull & Paul E Lopes. This is
one evening no one will want to miss as SYLK is sure to throw down.
As well, Thurs-Sat features a local lineup of strong hip-hop and dub groups
at the Rivoli,  including Choclair with Marvel & Solitair with Dj Stash on
Thursday, Codex with the Resinators & DJ Medicine Muffin on Friday, & The
Pocket Dwellers with A.K.A. & DJ Serious on Saturday.
For more info on Urban Rhythm & tix outlets, please call our infoline @
416.760.3135, and soon you'll find us on the web @
www.techno.ca/urbanrhythm.

Last but not Least, RITUAL 6 returns to Industry on Saturday September 26
with the return of Derrick Carter & Mark Farina to Toronto, following the
legendary night of their last combined set for Ritual 2: Liberation@
Industry on March 21. We can't wait.

Ritual can be found on the web @ www.techno.ca/ritual, but our site is
still a bit primitive--and we haven't had a chance to update it in a while.
HOWEVER, our website is the BEST place if you want to add yourself or
someone else to our growing email & snail-mail mailing list.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with RITUAL events, RITUAL was founded
by Beverly May, formerly known as a member of the Toronto promotions groups
Transcendance & Minimal. Ritual is now Beverly working in conjunction with
Willie Knox, who used to be a part of the Toronto promotions group Natural
Selection. A bit of background: Beverly founded Transcendance in Toronto in
September 1994 after a prolonged & inspiring stint of London UK clubbing
and Toronto 'raving'. From the beginning, Transcendance was both a
promotions group & a magazine. As promoters, Transcendance brought such
groups as Plastikman live, Richie Hawtin, Matt Hawtin, Eddie Richards,
Autechre, Spacetime Continuum, Psychic Warriors ov Gaia, Aux 88 live, Mark
Broom, Dan Curtin, Mark Gage (Vapourspace) live, D Wynn, Andrew Rawnsley,
Kelli Hand, Scanner live, Nic B & Fred Everything, Mark Farina, Mini Mono,
Legion of Green Men, Dubtribe live and many others to Toronto. As a
magazine, Transcendance attained a circulation of almost 15,000 as a free
quarterly distributed around N. America & focusing particularly on house &
techno in the midwest, with articles on Kelli Hand, Detroit, Chicago,
Laurent Garnier, Mark from Hardwax, Dan Bell, G Man, Jamie Myerson, Dego
from 4-Hero and many others. Transcendance officially ended in the fall of
1996. After this time, Beverly continued to promote under other names such
as Minimal, and showcased such acts as Orbital live, Speedy J live, Derrick
Carter, Green Velvet live & Johnny Fiasco. Beverly then went off to India &
SE Asia for 4 months and returned to found Ritual, which has held 2 events
to date, one with Richie Hawtin in November 1997 & one  with Derrick
Carter, Mark Farina & J-Dub in March 98.

*********************

NEW BOOK IN THE WORKS ON HOUSE & TECHNO:

FUTURE JAZZ, THE AMERICAN ROOTS OF HOUSE & TECHNO

Beverly's other major project to date is the writing of a book on the
American roots of house & techno in Detroit & Chicago from 1978-1998,
entitled, Future Jazz: The American Roots of House & Techno.
Though Beverly does not yet have a publisher (any takers?), she has been
diligently documenting the predominantly African-American roots of the
music for almost a year now, and her book is approximately 1/3 finished.
Future Jazz is an interview-based book in its research, and Beverly has
completed over 45 interviews already with  major Detroit & Chicago artists.

Future Jazz is a mix of both pure history with anecdotes and cultural
'analysis'. It attempts to explain the meaningful and real roots of our
culture to both insiders and newcomers. It barely touches on rave, drugs,
or all of European techno & house, for that matter- and only mentions NY as
a preface to Chicago. This is purely to try and focus on one topic and
thoroughly explore it rather than cover everything superficially.
Future Jazz's main thesis is that house & techno are culturally and
musically very much like early jazz during the 1920's Harlem Renaissance.
The preface to Future Jazz postulates a direct analogy of the two musics
from a variety of cultural and musical perspectives, which is then alluded
to in brief ways during the rest of the book.
Anyone who is interested in learning more about Future Jazz can visit the
website at www.techno.ca/futurejazz -- on the website you can also sign up
to be posted by email of any revisions to the website itself. Eventually,
we hope to have the website host sample chapters as well as the unedited
transcripts with the artists in the archives for the ultra-trainspotters.

Lastly, look for the July 22 issue of XLR8R, which features a cover story
on Carl Craig & Richie Hawtin, written by yours truly as a part of the
series for Future Jazz.

actually, there is some truth to this rumour from what i've heard.
supposedly, some hiv/aids infected people who are extremely bitter about
it are offering up needles they've used, trying to infect others. i
haven't heard of anyone getting infected for sure, but that's what the
rumourmill sez.

Attention promoters........

Like we all have once in a while.  August is a lite month for me, booking
wise.  Since one my greatest pleasures is to spin in front of crowds I'm
gonna start going through the shakes if I don't play this month. :)

If any promoter would like me to come out and play as a special guest for a
favorable fee for you please contact me at trevorl@gte.net or
twilson@lexmark.com.

I'll give more details of the favorable fee and travel if and when you
contact me.

he's baaaaaaaaack...

i just read all 179 of my pb-cle emails, and i'm ready to review, so
here goes:

***********INTERGALACTIC CIRCUS************
everyone already knows this was a grrRRrrrRreat rave! circuit 6's set
went down pretty well in the second room, i thought. many more headz
dancin then i would expect for spinnin first. right after my set, it
was time to roll... no, not leave - roll. i headed out to explore this
huge wonderful venue, that was so nicely decorated with all sorts of
fun stuff. 

the main room was massive. nice sound setup, really nice lights
set-up. it was hot as a muthafucka, but it was all good. i didn't
really go for 7up and zemo's sets. what's up with those guys? why are
they always spinnin together? it seems like they play the same rekkids
every time i see em, but they do seem to get heads dancin. 

the second room had a nice vibe goin on, too... like geoff said, sorta
like the g&k atmosphere. the crowd was tight and lovin it. 

i promised myself that i would dance for the entire atomic babies set
(only stopping to drink water and to cool off on the A/C in the
back... "todd... if you put your arms out in front of you and get
right in front of it, that is the closest you will ever get to being
superman") and it was one of the best choices i have ever made. they
were so awesome. their set as a whole was beautifully constructed,
too, bringing back elements towards the end that they had previously
used, etc. that's not the kind of thing you normally notice if you are
running from room to room being social + all dat (as i tend to be
sometimes). i made a friend on the dancefloor + we had a baby powder
on the floor party and passsed around the laser glasses :) 

thomas michael was incredible, too. his buildups were phenomenal. the
funny thing was that he would play several tracks in a row, that
seemed like they were going to drop after the buildup, but instead
played everyone on the dancefloor, as the actual drop came in 4 bars
later (youknowwhatimean?). by the time everyone on the dancefloor got
played like 3 or 4 times in a row, he would drop a track where it
actually does drop at the end of a buildup, and everyone, thinkin they
were 1 step ahead of the game waited to make sure they didn't get
played again, and the beat drop and they were just standing there
(oooh.... they got played again :) my theory was that that was what
made the violent guy so violent :) 

seriously, tho - i saw the whole violent guy thing go down on the
dancefloor. during the atomic babies' set he was dancing, and really
getting into it, sorta fervently vibing people on, like "YEAH!
dance!", like he was reallty feeling it, and really wanted people to
love it as much as he loved it. he was saying suff to me like "yeah!
dance like that, yeah!" and if i put my hands in the air, it was all
like "yeah!! put your hands in the air"... it wasn't just with me, it
was with some other people, too. it was kind of weird, but i could
empathise with the guy, cause even tho i've never felt like THAT, i
have been in similar mindsets. well, eventually something went wrong,
and he sort of went running around the dancefloor... well, not
running, but more like walking really fast, looking at everyone
dancing and sporadically dancing. maybe, someone bumped into him, or
someone's flailing body part hit him but he just started goin around,
pushing people. i was facing the speakers + the dj, REALLY enjoying
thomas michaels, and i turned around + i saw him go up to this REALLY
nice girl, hit/shove her forcefully and storm by her. she went from
wonderulgreatvibeydancefloorfunhavin to really sad because it was so
mean. it mad me so sad to see her be so upset, and so i gave her a big
hug and made sure everything was ok. she calmed down a little bit, but
was still SWOLL, so she went and got rich/kelly/the cops + whoever
else. they got there pretty soon and rich did his best to keep him
under control, but her wasn't havin it. he didn't want to hear any
sort of suggestions from anyone, it didn't look like. he would turn in
the other direction and dance away nervously/frantically. he tried to
hurt someone else and the cops and rich subdued him and got him in
handcuffs. during this whole time he would try to break away to dance.
iut was a really sad thing to see, and a lot of people witnessed it.
the vibe on the dancefloor for the 15 minutes after that was just
straight up weird, cause that was what was on everyone's mind. the
girl who got shoved came over and gave me a lollipop, a big hug, and a
thank you and that snapped me right out of it. ain't nothin a little
PLURaveyness wont take care of.

josh ryan's set was quite impressive in the second room. it was alot
different then the last time i heard him, a bit harder (more fun to
dance to imho) with catchier hooks and melodies. nice job, opus. i
also caught some of tim zelch's set (that's a DAMN SHAME that felix
didn't show) and had a dance party with spike and some other peeps out
on the dancefloor.

did i mention that EVERYONE was rollin? lemons. limes. mollys
(molecules). the vibe was thick, man... quite an atmosphere. i also
notice a severe lack of k and crystal. NO ONE tried to push it on me,
that was nice. the peeps who took the limes were way outie. i would
ask em how they were doin' and the unanimous response was just to give
me a GIANT HUGE hug, then when they were finished, roll their eyes
around in their headz and look fucked up ;)

the second room was foggier than san fran @ one point! i couldnt see a
damn thing!!!! i put my water bottle down next to me (like 1 foot) and
never saw it again. i tried to pick it up 10 seconds after i put it
down, but it was out of sight... a lost cause. i walked back toward
the entrance to i could see something again, bumping into people on
the way. as i got toward the back, i saw a few people sitting in a
line perpendicualr to the way i was walking, and saw a break in the
line and headed for it, hoping the exit was somewhere on the other side.

*smack*

oops, a wall :) i felt like a mad gimp. i turned around slowly (cause
it took some time to recover cause i didn't know quite what happened)
and sat down. some guy sitting down on my left said something along
the lines of "haha! that's how we all ended up here".

shouts goin out to kelly, hey_you, dapwezz, geek-acidsoccer-boy, and
everyone who was rollin that got zapped by the vibrator thingy that we
brought :)

******************VACATION*********************
yo. thanks very much to everyone who wrote my mom. things didn't go
down as expected, but i did end up getting to spin @ both parties AND
go on vacation in boston (damn that's a nice place). 

*********LIFE IS BUT A DREAM***********
so i came back early from vacation to go to this one, right, and it
was mad worth it. it was a fuckin huge success. todd + i spun main
room first, and layed down a tight set for the most part, with a low
of new rekkids and promos from 4front in boston. unfortunetly, no one
dances to the first act, but how can i complain? i'm one step closer
to my goal, spinnin for a large dancefloor that's packed with people
tryin to dance to every beat... the dancefloor that im a part of @
every rave i go to @ 1:00 in the mornin with a whole bunch of the
greatest people out there havin a great time.

the main room was a little small and it got HOT! a lot of the out of
town "party kids" didnt actually go inside. they just chilled outside
and talked about how beat the rave was. puh-leez! the vibe was on.
there were all sorts of people on the dancefloor havin a great time.
after circuit 6 and the bubbles (with the dancehall styleee... all
45's, boyeee) the style was almost strictly ragga. d-cypol layed down
a tight set of mashupraggahardstep that got the crowd movin, including
a lot of old skool anthems. the crazy one busted out a j and passed it
around amongst the listmembers + general friends + family. that
livened everyone up a good bit, just cause it was so goofy to kick a
session right up front by the fans :) jo took the stage and rinsed out
some HARD-step that i just couldn't get enuff of. dancefloor shouts
goin out to sam, mskw1, todd, seth, jon, ian, tom, josh, k, and lots
of other people gettin down old skool style. jo went into some
beautifully cheesy old skool hardcore with vocals and all that, and
the place loved it (k... i just KNOW you were lovin that hardcore :).
marcus was next comin correct with some new skool ragga and jungle. he
played junglist 98, dillinja's acid trak, and valley of the shadows.
all of which i was REALLY happy to hear. some whack-ass mc came on...
:) just kiddin, hossam showed up late and tore it up for the last 20
minutes or so of marcus' set, vibin the crowd up EVEN MORE! (didn't
think that was possible). respect...

basically, it was a whistle blowin', lighter-in-the-air, crazy dancin'
junglefest.

i had to leave right when gabbergirl came on... how did she go down w/
that crowd?

thanks to both geoff and jon for hookin' me up with whistles! i will
give them back, i promise! unfortunetly i forgot to give out the party
favors i brought, but i guess they will have to wait till another rave.

many props goin out to ALL pbs massive (tom, andy, jon, steve, etc.
etc.), esp geoff (the man with the plan). you pulled it off nicely,
and i hope you keep @ it. same with downlow! you did an excellent
job... mad organization skillz. where that email with the DL info? we
want inside information, dammit :) i'm really lookin forward to your
next raves, whether i'll be spinnin @ it or just bein my crazy raver
self. the summer is still goin strong, and hopefully we can get some
more ravin goin on before the school year starts back up. even low key
shit is cool - we should have more bbq's and shit. parties in the
park... whatever. anyone know what up with sense?

props goin out to those who read this far, too.... there are mad KBs
of text. with all of this typing, to - i know i left out some shit. oh
well, i'll just have to live with it.

just so ya know, this last week of raving has really renewed my faith
in the pgh rave scene and the whole rave thing in general. much love
to all my peoples :)

...frankie g

ps - where's dan kelly at? i havent seen him for a while.

     ok, since i gave up on sprout'n (boohoo) i
     can afford to spend some of my post-party 
     afternoon writing about this slightly strange,
     very interesting, and rather fun little rave.

     having nothing much to do friday (or rather, no
     scheduled work and a lack of interest in any of
     my current projects) i showed up at millvale 
     industrial theater at about 3:00pm, basically to
     check out the venue and to see if my friends 
     needed any technical help or something. i'd never
     seen the place before, and wandered around the 
     post-apocalyptic (and rather stuffy) little rooms
     getting wierded out by manny and trying unsucessfully
     to imagine what they'd be like full of hundreds of
     dancing raver kidz.

     turns out that my friends DID need a little help.
     this is definitely not the first time that
     i've turned up early to an event and ended up
     spending several hours frantically plugging
     together equipment and throwing speaker
     cabs around. although wizard workshop had a 
     massively overpowered system in the main room,
     there wasn't anything in the second room or
     outside. tom was phoning around trying to find a
     place to rent a system, and a casual offer to 
     help ended up with me setting up the sound in
     the second room and outside. loads of fun :]

     i think the scariest part was about 10pm when an
     extension cord fried in the second room and all
     the lights and sound just quit. but we managed to
     fix it somehow.

     :P

     mad props to the p.b.s. crew for throwing an 
     honest, real party and worrying about the people
     rather than about the money. you guys are what
     makes the scene special. and even if the sub
     in the second room had wierd feedback problems,
     and the outside system got shut off early in 
     the morning, the party was still a lot of fun.

     speaking of which, i just have to do a little
     trouty here:

     GABBER

     <big silly grin>

     now, i don't listen to the stuff, and under most
     circumstances find hardcore quite annoying. but
     for some reason i found myself in a dark, hot 
     room full of people just dancing my ass off while
     this little girl in pigtails preached the evil
     doctrine of dance from the tables.

     i have to admit that i didn't really get into it
     before d.cypol came on, and even then sorta faded
     in and out. but 1.8.7. (fucking prodigy, baby)
     fried my brain and after that the only thing that
     shut me down was the pain in my legs. one guy who
     really seemed to enjoy my violent gabber routine
     said 'i feel like i'm in a club in NY'. yeah, we
     have a lot of catch-up to play yet.

     interesting side-note: the people from technostate
     were _wonderful_. i talked to wolverine for at least
     half an hour, and to fishead for a bit, too. it's
     really nice to find people who care about the kids
     more than about their name or image.

     well, strange review, nice party. it really renewed
     my faith in the pittsburgh 'scene', which after 
     metropol the night before (strange frat-boy crowd) 
     was really very nice indeed.

     mad shouts to tom, geoff, john, meat, and all the
     rest responsible for a great evening. hope the kid
     that passed out turned out ok, and also that there
     aren't any repercussions. net-geek shouts to jen,
     mike, trouty, schwanke, liquid, baum, absolut, xspyboy,
     frankieg and whoever else said hi.

     quote of the evening:
     "yinz got any e?" 

     <giggle>

     hugz

Props to PBS!
one down, ? to go!
yeah, that's right, life is but a dream appeared to be a big success, despite
the bitch venue owner (at least we didn't have to duct tape him to a rafter :]
) ...
my favorite parts / no order:
*the ghettoness of the space: peeling walls, the couch with seatbelts, etc.
*black lights in the bathroom
*more free shit than igc (need i say an entire BATALLION OF FUCKING YODAS
*as much variety in music styles as you could ask for (assorted jungle, a
little house, much hardcore, mc'd dancehall, slow breaks, mskw1 [given that
the only part of his set that i caught was the end where he was pulling tricks
w/ beastie boys "shadrach" and some other some which also said "shadrach
mishach and abendigo", followed by some beat-free horn tune,  i have to say
70's breaks might not be the right term, but it was still nice], am i
forgetting anything? 
*each individual set went beyond the fact that it was unique and acceptin the
fact that it was dope as shit, esp. Original Bubbles/dancehall,
Gabbergirl/hardcore, 187/jungle (marcus and d.cypol were great, but 187 was my
fav)
*Gabbergirl is cool as shit (I had a few conversations w/ her before her
set... she said things like "welcoming to the weird & wild world of raving"
(b/c it's my first  year to her fifth) and "Pittsburgh and libad are SUPER
FUCKING AWESOME!!:) )
*the place was packed with old and new :)  friends...big up to everybody there
who was wearing more than boxer shorts! ... ain't we the shit?
*there was always at least one convinient, empty seat (at igc this wasn't
true.)
*the crowd was so happy, it ate all of my candy!!! [in a good way :) ]
last, but sure as all of fucking hell not least:

PBS is planning on doing this again!
  (but at a different venue, of course.)

of course, one or two bad things did happen to me.  not terrible, definately
shit i can live wit, no problem:
*i am 95% sure that the mic i took home wasn't the mic i brought there.  i
think the mic i took home is way better and doesn't belong to me.  SO: is
there a missing mic, and is there a found mic.  i have a feeling the mic i
have might be taken for stolen (if i did steal it i wouldn't be writing this)
and i'd like to return it to it's rightful owner.  i would also like whoever
has my mic to GIVE IT BACK.  I just got it last week and really need it.  it
should be pretty obvious to you that you have a mic you don't own if you do
(based on this personal experience).  it should have some cruddy stuff on the
top of the ball.
MAY JUSTICE BE SERVED.
*i lost my bright orange wig :(.  this is my fault.  i was walking around with
it and some unknown girl begged me to let her wear it and i couldn't resist.
i also couldn't resist letting her show her friends.  or wearing it the whole
night.  i kept an eye on her/it at first, but after a while i just left the
area.  i saw the girl again later, no wig/she had let a friend wear it.  she
promised to get it back for me but never did.  on one hand, i'm short a wig.
on the other hand, the girl liked it way better than i ever did, and i wish i
would've given her the bag it came in.

preface: please read this?  i spent half an hour writing it!!!  it's sincere

hi kids.  i haven't been posting much lately, if you haven't noticed.  it's
because i never know what really i should/should not say, since this is a
public forum and it's hard to tell what will be considered valuable
information to other ppl.  i try not to talk about drugs and i never speak in
negatives.  i had a lot of fun at the pbs party last night, but i ran into two
not-nice ppl that i keep thinking about ... one drunk girl who tried to trick
me into giving her my bag, and another girl who was totally tripping out - i
mean not just tripping, but really tripping out.  kids like this make parties
look bad, and i hesitate in publicizing bad experiences like this when
everything else was phat.  

oh and before i go on, i also want to tell you pb-cle kids that i love you
all.  i first subscribed to this list like six months ago, secretly thinking
to myself "oh i'm down, i don't need to be on some dorky email list to get the
word," but honestly i get more info about the local happenings from this list
than i do anywhere else.  then after i first started to receive email from all
you strangers, i thot "these kids are way too involved, like get a life!"  and
a couple weeks ago i went to a "netmeet," and i already knew some of you ...
but sincerely, you guys rule.  i love meeting party kids :) i don't know if
this is a good thing or a bad thing, like ever since i've been on this list,
my interest in big parties has really increased ... and no doubt, you all
represent half of the correlation <3

okay so now on to last night's party ... i'm not going to tell u all about "at
first i was sleepy, so i sat down, then i went into the next room, then i
scratched my butt" ... i just wanna say that this party was really intimate-
like.  a few hundred heads, but i felt like i knew a lot of the kids there,
even the out-of-towners.  

oh!  and!  (this is for all you boys who sometimes sense animosity from other
boys)  in one of the small rooms there were five boys giving each other
backrubs ... this made me happy because we had no cares of misinterpreted
sexuality or ill behavior, just u know ... luvin :) nothing is more annoying
that a boy who pushes me away when i offer a hug

okay so the main room was hot, and the second room was hotter, but i found it
manageable by taking off clothes, drinking water, and dancing by the fans.
actually i kind of like that place, there were those two dance floors, the
back room, the front room (with the free candy+toys+fruit) (big big ups for
those really valuable giveaways) the chill room and the middle hallway room
... and lots of fun hideaways outside ... but ... only one of the two queued-
up closet-style bathrooms had running water.  

can someone offer any hints on taking care of someone who is on a bad trip?
like if she doesn't want to drink water, should you make her?

okay kids, that's it for now ... much luv to the boys and girls who deserve
it, u know who u are because i've hugged you

oh wait, no i have another story about last night.  i sat in the chill room
for about like an hour, as the sky lightened.  some kid was pushing beside be
for most of the time, and i was cool with that like whatever.  then he sniffed
something with a girl, and we started talking ... i asked them what they took
and they were totally tards about it, like they honestly had no idea.  coulda
been k, meth, coke, aspirin ... if they were lucky.  apparently he was
actually slinging o, which actually i've never seen at a party in the 412, and
he and another kid traded bags.  he counted his bills and took off pleasantly,
but left his little crocheted change purse behind!  well there really wasn't
much in it, really nothing more valubale than the purse itself.  i don't think
i'm gonna eat it, and i really don't think i'm gonna give it away either.  

okay that's really it.  BYEEEE for now

only users lose drugs -

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

after reading over the few reviews of LIBAD that have been posted so
far, i'm happy to hear that it went as well as i thought it would...

unfortunately, even after many attempts to not let it happen, i ended up
not being able to make it down to the party... *sigh*

instead of coming, i had to drive all nite.. i left, with my family, for
our vacation to myrtle beach last nite and thats where i am now...
(laptop + 100 free aol hours + aol's winsock = free internet at beach)
*grin*

now don't get me wrong, i am *extremely* happy to be down here, i love
the beach, *but* accepting the fact that i was going to miss *this*
party was really, really, really hard to do. for me, it was the first
party where i've been good friends with the promoters of the party, as
well as several performers... it wasn't just that i knew these people
either, it was the fact that i knew what kind of people they were, and
as a result, just how much potential this party had to be an
unbelieveably awesome event... they didn't let me down...

as far as the promoters go, you couldn't have asked for a better crew to
throw a party... those of you who know tom, geoff, and the rest of the
pbs crew, you know what i'm talking about... i've become friends with
them over the past year and they're the kind of people who's
personalities reflect the 'good' side of the party scene... they *are*
there for the good things: the friendships, the fun, the music, the
vibe.. you know what i mean... : >

as far as the performers, i've had the pleasure of either knowing or
working with a good part of the party's lineup (as i'm sure was the case
with lot of people on the list, given how involved the promoters are
with the pb-cle list)

from all the great times i've had while hanging out / being at parties /
talking / watching perform, circuit 6, mskw1, da mofo, doc cutup, dj
reliant and product 19 and performing with jo / 187, the party was one i
didn't want to miss for the world.. as far as party people go, to me
this was like my whole party family coming together at once and...
*arrghhh* i couldn't be there for it...

its all good though, the next pbs party is going to be that much better
for me because of it....


to wrap this up, let me just congratulate again everyone that had a part
in helping with this... whether it be promotion, lights, sound,
whatever... i'm glad it was a success and would love to hear some more
reviews from you guys that were there.

i'll be down here in myrtle beach for the rest of this week and i'm
going to try to report on any kind of a party scene that i find down
here... :>  ..the fine people on the SE-RAVE list are helping me with
this one and, if nothing else, hopfully i'll at least be able to check
out a few weekly events...

that's it for now, but rest assured, there's more coming soon....

I'll tell ya I had a fine b'day at LIBAD and I stayed staight(whoo-hoo).  
The vibe I got from most of yall was straight up friendly.  The 'rave 
shuttle' was a blast.  WE were the crazies in the back rappin' up(bet 
you thought we were on drugs).  The driver was a great guy.  The 
production kids were excelente.  Thanks to Andy, Steve, wow I should not 
name names since I forgot most thank you ALL.  The free fruit was tasty, 
baby. WEll, I thank you for givin' me a ride back to Rite Aid in your 
own car since the shuttle took so long(yes I did get in trouble though 
for coming home late).  
I only stayed till 4:30 am but believe me I wanted to stay.  The jungle 
was kickin it from Marcus and others??  Gabbergirl rocked the house 
baby.  Seeing her spin that hard stuff made me want to grow up and be 
like her.  I get all emotional and stuff.  THe place was really hot, so 
chillin outside on those screen things was my salvation.  It was so 
ghetto but so REAL, just how I like it. I'm lovin' Pittsburgh so badly 
right now> it is going to be sad to go back to Columbus in a month.  I 
am gonna miss it ;`( 

Well gotta go
bEnny(I had the messed up tank with fire and a butterfly flying into it

life is but a dream sucked. the assholes who threw it need to be shot.  
there was this really annoying guy there wearing all black with bleached 
hair. i hated him. the guy who owned the space was really cool. overall, 
i would say that i would have had a better time buying $10 worth of 
roofing nails and shoving them up my ass.

well, after many a hectic hour, the party went off pretty well....the 
only problems i saw were th lack of enough bottled water, the broken 
sink (didnt find out about that till the day of) and the heat (i  guess 
we should got one of those airconditioners....)
we had some problems with the owner of the space and an individual on 
many drugs, but those were the extent of the problems that we could not 
control...
all of the sets were strong...cicuit 6 rocked, bubbles(!!!!!), d.cypol 
(4 rewinds!!!!), 1.8.7. (!!!!), marcus (!!!!!!), gabber girl(the best 
set ive ever heard, hands down!!!!!!!!!), the instigator, and the early 
mornig set from product 19...
the second room was awesome with the technostate crew (anuerism, 
fishead, optic, and wolverine), craig k., da mofo, mskw1, ed umm, 
andrew, doc cut-up and myself..
the outside was nice until the pigs shut it down with dj suga bear 
droppin some hip-hop...
the vibe seemed awesome to me, but im sure im pretty biased
the sound was good overall, except for some feedback problems in the 
second room...
i thouroughly enjoyed myself.
big ups to geoff, john, andy b., andythesuge, lauren, marcy, steve, tim, 
beckey, josh b., sunni, sheri, and everyone else i forgot...and last but 
not least, ED!!!! (the generally hard security guy:)
also, fuck manny theiner..
i hope you all had fun....
please email me or pbs with any complaints or suggestions...
thanx, toM

i have mHonArc running in place of hypermail now, the script is done.  i'll
be redoing all the old archives, since the old ones done with hypermail are
sketchy!

anyhow, something to bear in mind with the new program, it will stick
attachments in the archives.  meaning .gifs .jpgs and stuff.....

All right here goes:

-Circuit 6 started shit up . . . I was happy w/ it except for the
gravediggaz mix :(  The needle on one of the turntables was fucked up.
 Don: drop me a line.

-Ragga DJ and MC: Rocked the place.  That shit sounded like halfspeed
old school jungle to me :)  Big big big up the MC who was hypin' the
crowd like mad.

-D.Cypol: Started off old-school hardcore moving into
mash-up/hardsteppy shit.  The proper count on the rewinds was 2 (not 4
tom).  And he tried to diss us on the first one!  He decided to change
his mind when I tore the "Be Kind Please Rewind" sign off of the front
of the turntables and help it up really high.  Whatever that last
track he played with the backwards woman vocals is fucking incredible.
 If you were there you know what I mean.

-187: continued w/ the mash-up untill about 30 minutes into her set
when she started dropping cheesey old-school.  At this point, I was so
siced and the vibe was so great w/ whistles and lasers goin'
everywhere that I got up on stage and started hypin' the crowd.  It
was great riding those buildups watching the crowd get more and more
excited and feeding off that and as a result having them feed off me. 
It was great.

-Marcus: continued the excellence w/ both current and old school ragga
tracks as well as some hardstep and har jump-up.  He rocked, and the
mofo on the mic at the end tore it up as well :)  

OK, individual shout-outs:

Goeff-you da shit.  The man w/ the plan . . . you made it all come
together.

The rest of PBS-you da shit as well.  I know that some of put your
differences aside to create a great event.

I gotta go, so: everybody else I talked to . . . . you know who you are.

I'd also like to give a really big shout out to:
The girl in the grey tanktop/black sports bra that was probably the
best technical dancer I've ever seen in real life . . . let alone at a
rave.  She could have been in a Paula Abdul video or something . . .
and that really hit home when I was dancing with her too.  She said
she went to some danceschool.

well, I gotta roll,

absolut

ps-oh yeah and I didn't have any citrus fruit or anything of the like
either . . . it felt like it though.

I was thinking of writing to them asking them why they dont have a 'dont 
lie' to your kids under the parental tips, considering there are several of 
these lies on the site. :) But i think that would be counter productive. :)

children should know that acid is cut with PCP and that ecstasy is a
*hallucinogen* that causes powerful sensory 'distortions.'

Well, its a 'tight' space.
Though I was impressed with the ability to hang outside.  Much opens up the 
space for attendance.  It is unfortunate that its so goddam hot in there. 
 I wish the owner would cool it down a bit. I highly doubt raves are the 
only events that have problems with heat there.  I find it tolerable 
though, I just dont dance as much as I would like (too prone to passing 
out).

     yeah, i saw that guy with bleached hair too. he 
     thinks he's just the shit, and is always bringing
     down the vibe. i think the next time i see him i'll
     shoot him.

     i met the owner of the space tho, and he is SO
     cool. he had all these phat electronica records and
     stuff. or something. when i grow up i want to be
     like him.

     um, i've never tried that roofing nails trick. i
     bet it's pretty cost-effective, huh?

     <serious> does anybody have my 50 watt amp i had
     on the monitor in the second room? i'd kinda like
     it back, although no biggie. i bet manny just 
     added it to his collection. </serious>

     those p.b.s. people are a bunch of losers. especially
     that tom guy.

     :P

I thought it sucked. 

  Got there about 3 AM, paid 20 bucks. About 5AM something started to go wrong
w/ the sound, might have been the needle..I dunno, so then they just turned
the music down after having to shut the music off a few times to fix whatever
was going on. It was cold, wet, kinda muddy. I heard that 3 of the dj's didn't
show, ( 2 of the 3 that were said to be missing were actually there ) but I
wasn't paying attention, so I guess it really doesn't matter to me anyways. I
was being anti-social, and all I did was think about how bad I really wanted
to be in my bed sleeping. Well they say the vibe/ your experience is what you
make it, and I guess last night just wasn't my night to vibe yo :-)~

Hope everyone had a wonderful weekend!!
Peace
Amy

Well.....LIBAD was rockin'  I really enjoyed myself....although i guess 
im kinda biased. Everyone there was really keen. 

Besides the fact that Manny Fucker...i mean theiner.....screwed us up a 
damn but.....everything went really smooth...

D Cypol rocked the crowd...and when 187 roled on it was jumpin'. 

GABBERGIRL IS RAD AS HELL.......She got the crowd movin to her 
hardcore......the greastest thing was simply  a silouette of two 
pigtails bobbin back and forth to the monsterous beats..

I hope the young man who had to go to the hospital is doin ok....

I wanna thank......geOFF(the man with the ham)....toM(the happy guy who 
thinks he can grow dreads.....Crotch(even though he was stressin about 
his phallus size)....ED( the absolute hardest ass you will ever meet at 
the entrance to a party).....meat(he's meat)...Suge(he for some reason

> ps you have not heard the last of pbs

I am very happy to hear this.  

I wasn't going to post anything because pretty much everything everyone is
saying is pretty much how I feel, as well.  

Last night's party was the first one in a long time that I just broke down
and danced.  Not worrying about anyone else.  Not noticing anyone
watching.  Just dancing because the music moved me to do so.  I saw people
I cared for.  I saw friends from the distant past.  I met new people.  I
was very happy.  I danced during 1.8.7.'s set because it was so wonderful.
I really liked the early songs the best.  I missed d.Cypol's set and I was
SUPREMELY sad.  I danced during mskw1's set (for obvious reasons).  I
danced a little during da Mofo's set because it was so happy.  It was a
good time.

It would be very easy for me to say that pbs should crank out some more
parties like LIBAD.  I think they should but maybe not like you're
thinking I mean.  I think LIBAD was original for our time.  It was
original because it wasn't like any of the parties that have gone on in
the last year or so.  I would like to see them turn out parties that are
original in that when people come to them, they don't know what to expect
except a really amazingly good time that they haven't had since the last
time.  

Remembering Silver Clouds,
Jenifer Foulmood

>> haha, i about died laughin when i did this cuz my boy ryan lives in mt. 
gilead and according to yahoo maps, mt. gilead is east bumblefuck, ohio!
well the thing is yahoo maps has this bug dat when it can't find a place
in ohio, it alwaze shows this spot near mt. gilead...unfortunately, mt. gilead
is  about an hour west of the actual sight, but if yur really into yahoo maps,
u can enter "stillwater, ohio", which is kinda close to Tappan Lake and 
dat'll work... <<
 
yeah, i was the fool who drove to columbus (accidentaly), back up to mt.
gilead, from there to a park called teppan lake in mansefield...not TAPPAN
LAKE. basically it took us 5 hours to do an 1 1/2 hour drive.....buts it all
good, cause we made up for lost time and partied down!

I'm wondering if anyone else has the same problem I do -- when I try to 
open a new message, all I get is a blank screen.  I have 48 messages 
that I cannot read.  I really hope I don't lose them all.  If there are 
any replies to this, could you please post to the list so I can read the 
archives later?

> also, fuck manny theiner..

When dealing with Manny, I like to use a slow, calm, and calculated tone
of voice.  Large 50cent words are also included.  I find this plan of
attack annoys him much more than any amount of whining, shouting, or
insulting could ever do.

You can get in touch with Pimp Daddy Freeze via email:
  freeze <freeze@better.net>

He's a cool guy and I'm sure he can hook you up with a tape of his rockin'

Gabbergirl was wicked beyond belief IMHO...

:)

I gotta say I'm ear to ear grinnin' with people axin' bout these djs! :)
If you want info on getting the music of any DJs/ACTs from LIBAD, drop me
an email and I'll point you in the right direction.

Gabbergirl and the technostate crew have a website @ www.technostate.com
- if you check it out you can email them about tapes or cds...the put out
a cd recently - if you didn't get one @ LIBAD I believe there should be
some available at hypervinyl.

so nobody has any advice to give me about how to take care of someone who is
on really buggin?  well you know how bad trips bring out the innermost fears,
the most unattractive dimensions - how are you supposed to deal with that if
you're babysitting?  when is it appropriate to make someone
walk/talk/drink/etc?  if at all ...

hugs ... or drugs

     um, as far as i am concerned, provided they are
     conscious, talking occasionally (they don't have
     to make sense all the time) and within the human body's 
     operating parameters (pulse between 75-150, body
     temp between 97-102f) they should be ok, physically.
     keeping their vitals in the green/orange and keeping
     them conscious is basically all you can do for a person
     without a battery of specialized drugs and extensive
     treatment knowledge (which i do not posess). knowing
     CPR is a very good thing, but not, i hope, relevant
     to this discussion.

     water is important only to cool people down, if
     their body temperature and/or pulse is soaring.
     these (and rapid breathing) are symptomatic of
     dehydration. if they won't drink under these
     circumstances, drastic measures are to pour water
     on their body, head or clothing (NOT cold water).
     of course, it's very important to explain to 
     them what you want them to do, or what you're 
     doing, and why. as in 'you're dehydrated, your
     pulse is really high. please drink this, ok? 
     you'll feel better.' dehydration isn't dangerous
     in the short term (long term may cause kidney
     damage, which is NOT fun, take my word for it)
     but overheating can kill or damage permanently.

     as concerns talking someone down, you're not
     trying to avoid mental damage, you're trying to
     avoid panic and the associated physiological 
     runaway condition that may be damaging. so all
     i try to do is reassure the person that i care
     about them, that someone is there who knows 
     what they are doing and is going to hold their
     hand or cuddle them or whatever (physical contact
     can be very reassuring) and make sure they 
     are alright. i dunno, it's up to you. DON'T play
     mind games, or try to argue with someone, i've
     had people do this to me and it's vicious.

     if you don't know what they are on, definitely try
     to ask them. certain drugs or certain combinations
     have very definite effects, but external symptoms
     may not be the same. ask the person who they 
     came with. if they came with a friend, get someone
     else to try and find them. a familiar face may
     be very reassuring, plus the second person may 
     have important information (even if they don't 
     consider it important) about the subjects mental
     or physical history.

     it's really difficult to encapsulate all this. 
     basically, being a responsible person takes a
     lot of common sense, a level head (i'm no good at
     this when on acid or alcohol, and i don't know any
     who are) and a caring attitude. there are just 
     some people that are very good people to take
     drugs with, and some that are very bad. choose
     your friends carefully. good partners are damned
     hard to find, and taking stacks of drugs without
     anyone you trust is a dangerous thing to do.

     ask people to look after you, or your friends.
     if you care about someone, make sure that you or
     someone else you trust is watching them.

     good people take care of each other. stupid or
     careless people don't, and these people and their
     friends are the ones who get carried out of a 
     party.

     why did this turn into a lecture? i'm not sure.
     maybe it's because i've been in several situations 
     where i've sat in a corner at a party (not raves,
     usually) watching the room spin around me and 
     wondering when i'm going to feel my legs again
     and what the hell i'm doing in this city where 
     nobody knows me and i have no friends. maybe it's
     because i love the rave scene and want it to be
     a safe and happy experience, with or without 
     drugs (and trust me, i don't have any problem 
     with drugs, just what they do to people that 
     already probably angry and insecure, deep inside).

     well, whatever. i don't profess to be an expert, 
     but i DO profess to care.

     hugs and adrenaline shots

actually, i figured i'd share with everybody.

the best way that i have found to clean an x-fader is to pick up *TWO*
cans of compressed air. get appropriate screwdrivers and other tools.

open it up. carefully. use the compressed air to dust it off.

there. clean. that's all there is to it. also do that to the in/outs,
except you skip dissassembly. if there's rust, well, uh.. time for a new
x-fader i guess.

Really the only way to deal with a bad trip is find out what is causing the 
fear and remove them from the situation. If its too many people get away 
from people, if its the area you are in go somewhere else.  If they are 
scared of something thats not real then remind them that they are tripping 
and its all in their mind and the trip will end. Each person has to develop 
their own way to deal with a bad trip, if you are the copilot by their 
choice then they need to come forward and tell you whats wrong, whats 
causing it and then you just have to make a judgement as to how to help but 
its very person and situation specific.  If they dont trust their copilot 
to make decisions for them then there is no point in having the copilot.

As for keeping them physically safe (when to eat/drink etc) you would have 
to know when the last time was that they drank.  If they are not being 
physically active then I wouldnt force them, if they are being physically 
active then its a judgement call, but they should drink on a 'regular 
basis'.  Going for two hours without water and heavy dancing is probably 
not a good idea.

I would probably just sit them down, or hold them/hug them and basically 
pamper them, shower them in love and good feelings and suggestions and the 
reasoning for the suggestions. Pay them a LOT of attention (unless that is 
the problem).

okay well thanks to everyone who is trying to give me advice on babysitting.
hopefully it's not a stituation i'll have to experience any time soon.  

but i just want to remind you all that trips are really subjective
experiences, like you might say "i would want someone to hold me, to talk to
me, to feed me water" and yes that's the ideal for a lot of people.  but
friday, one girl was just like, "don't touch me, tell me a story," so i'd
start on a story then she'd be all, "shut up shut up, brush my hair, harder,
no not that hard" "now tell me a story" "do you have any toys" "no not those"
"something without a face ..."

at first it was nice to take care of someone, to be needed and appreciated,
but it became difficult and exhausting.  fortunately someone else was copilot
who seemed to enjoy it more than i.

if they're rollin sometimes they might feel really awful for no apparent
reason...
it distorts the way you feel, and sometimes simple things like needing to
use the bathroom or needing a drink of water can make you feel
upset/bored/pissed/frustrated .....  i've noticed it a few times myself and
so have a lot of my friends...

just a thought

Whats up all?
I just wanted to say that I had a really good time at LIBAD.  The
music was bomb!  I especially enjoyed Circuit 6, D-cypol, and 187. 
The vibe was great and  everyone, including me, was having a blast! 
The only problems were the extreme heat and the limited amount of
space.  But both of these things werent even that bad because you
could go outside to cool off if you were too hot, and the limited
space gave the party a more intimate feel.  Props goin out to Tom,
John, Steve, and the rest of PBS.  Way to go.  Seems like everything
went pretty well, and the party was alot of fun.  Also, shouts out to
Todd, Frankie, Seth, and all the headz who got my laser shined on
them.  I hope this is not the last party from PBS!

Peace,
***Josh***

This doesn't have too much relevance to the whole bad trip thing, but
as I was going into the bathroom one girl was kind of helping this
other really fucked up girl out, and the helping girl was kind of
telling everyone, "It's her first time rolling."  But it looked more
like her first time smoking crack.  anyone see this too?  was this the
same girl you were talkign about maybe?

What to do on Thursday...
	Elixir at the Avenue in Kent 10:30 - 3:00

This week is
	Darwin (the coolest, smoothest, groovinest house DJ around)
	Rob Riddum (Ohio's best junglist.  No shit.)
	Warren G & Drew (DJ + live = techhouse.  Techno & House...two great tastes
that taste great together)

I'll have a stack of tapes to give out:  half mine (techno, lots of it
Swedish like what the Sat night DJs @ Phunktion spun) and half my buddy's
(Speed Garage...kind of a hybrid of drum n bass & house).  If ya want one,
just ask...my name's Ken, & I'll wear a Blunt Kitty shirt.  I'll try to get
about 10 made up by then.

So it's on a Thursday...hey, during the summer every day is a weekend.

More info @ 330.676.0069   626 Water St.   18+ w/ID

(By the way, who was it from the list I met there last week?  Mail me...)

Doc Cut-Up if ya don't throw another party, I am gonna strangle you!
That HAD TO BE THE BEST ORGASM I EVER HAD!!!!  ooooMMMMMOOOOmmmmooo
(Me hearing Gabbergirl, Wolverine thank you for playing DEADLY BUDA!,
1.8.7. OLD SKOOL!  Bring out the yearbook, this is where I graduated!
Anuerism, and DaMoFo!)

Didn't get to hear John's set, had to go at 6:00, but the toys!
Did everyone get a toy?  I chose a yo yo thinking "I am not gonna really 
play with this, but it looks cool."   Was I ever wrong!  Making tapes 
gets boring.  What a fun time a yo yo can make!  It is a tin yo yo too!  
Tin toys are expensive.  Anyone go to one of those science stores and 
check out those prices?  What a find!

Give me more Hardcore!

guest will have passes waiting for you at the door (if you don't ask for

DJ Angstboy will be guesting afterwards, likely spinning goa and

a lot of ppl have been wanting copies of sets that dj sine has spun at
parties in the area over the past year or so.


dj sine is soon going to relase his 'archive' series.

copies of some of his best sets, all live, mastered straight to DAT.

each volume will be a limited edition run, professionally duplicated, and
will cost $10.

the first release will be his set from cheer. (house of styles, 3/28/98,
pgh. pa) classic breakbeat house anthems. those of you who were there know
how slammin' it was.

this is just an announcement, more details will be released soon.

peace,
hossam

Although it did have its fair share of snags, Sproutin' was still the
bomb!

The venue was perfect - a pretty lake, lovely pine forests and hidden
away just well enough to keep meddlesome locals and 50 out of the
picture. Everyone seemed to be in such good spirits (thanks mostly to
top notch chemicals) in spite of the technical fuck-ups which would
ordinarily be unforgivable. Such a mellow, open environment. No
frisking, no beefed-up bouncers, no pigs, no paranoia, no problem!

I had my best dance session from 9:00 am onwards when the deepest trance
session kicked in followed by some thumpin' house with enough groove to
keep you smiling. By morning everyone was showing a high-water mark on
their trousers from the dew- it was really quite comical! I hope the
organizers do a better job next time with the sound equipment 'coz
that's where the ball was dropped big time. Two hours of no audio
top-end nearly sent my over the edge. Rent some decent gear next time
from people who know what they're doing in the world of electronic music
not some washed-out metal heads... Otherwise a fab event. :-)

Big thanks to Travis and his clan for their fire and hospitality in the
pine needles. Especially to his cute little cousin for keeping me warm
with her sleeping bag in the cold morning hours...

Looking forward to the next excursion in a non-urban environment.

kiss  :-x

Brad

Well. i had a really good time at sproutin'.  I love outdoor parties, and
this venue was choice. The sound people did need to get their shit
together. for example,(a little behind the scenes look for all yinz) when
trackhead steve was spinnin'.  There was no highs at all and steve was
starting to get a bit irate that the sound people weren't doing their job.
He asked my friend jay to go do something with the sound and he didn't want
to touch it for fear of breakage. SO, Steve jumps down off the tables and
runs out to the sound booth to start messing with the sound. I dunno, but i
don't think they should have gotten paid in full for their services because
it's just bullshit when the DJ has to be fucking around with the sound
equipment. Other than that, everything went smoothly. There was much free
food left over. Sorry i didn't get to see some of you that went. I saw jade
and Amy(funkybizz) and that was about it. I was really bitter about the
fact that i missed Venoms set though. I heard he was throwin' the fuck down
starting off with ghetto house and going into hard house, then funky
breaks, then happy hardcore, then some trancy stuff. I was told that he was
doing all his crazy ninja shit too, scratchin' under his leg and with his
chin. hittin' the crossfader back and forth with his nose. I'm salty still,
just thinking about it.

the coolest thing that happened the whole time though was on sunday
morning.  My and my friend jay3 were walking around over by where the
vendors were and we stopped to talk to one of them.  This guy walks up to
us and was talking to the vendor also, but he had what looked like a
butterfly pin on his fishermans hat. we were all looking at it at the same
time and all of a sudden it flew away. it was amazing, because he had been
walking around at least for a little while with this gorgeous butterfly on
his hat and he didn't even know it. it was really cool. anywayz, i gotta go
to work kidzz, so.... LatE!

hah, I know something that irritates him more- when he tries to namedrop 
and show off how much he knows about klunky oldschool electronic noise, 
I just say "whatever" and act like I don't care, sometimes interjecting 
"history is bunk".
his head almost popped off the last time I did that =)

oh yes the vibe was tight.  real real tight, like up in ya face and strangle
ya neck.  just everywhere i went, i felt like we all knew each other  ... how
does the theme song for _cheers_ go?  "sometimes you wanna go where everybody
knows your name, and they're always glad you came ..."  and like how kids in
the main room, rather than stop dancing they would just take their clothes off
... three kids offered me smoke, four if you count the chick who tried to take
my bag (no comment on whether i accepted :P you know how i am about that) ...
sharing is caring ... like i think pbs should look into getting sponsored by
hallmark cards or something ... cyou all at steel city jungle and atomic ...

I think I'm required to at least give my thoughts on this event....

Personally, I had a BLAST.. 
The worst part about being the promoter is you don't get to hear all the
sets you want to, but what i did hear had me grinnin and skankin' it up.
"I love it when a plan comes together."

Only a few problems happened (cops shut down out outside system, the owner
bitching, and the heat), and only one really sad incident occured (i
won't get into it here), but the positive vibes and energy in the whole
place made dealing with these things soo very minor. :)  

It would have been nothing without the amazin' talents of the DJ's, mad
props and big ups to:  

the TECHNOSTATE Crew (massive respect for everything they stand for),
the Circuit 6 Duo, Original Bubbles + the First Class Crew, MARCUS, 187,
DCYPOL, the Instigator, Product 19, Pimp Daddy Freeze, MSKW1, Ed Ummm, 
Da Mofo, Craig K, and Andrew....these guys/gals are all amazing people and
djs....

Also, much thanks to MC Sphynx for rockin' the mic and helpin PBS in
general, Geekboy for the supernice tech assistance, Don and Randy who were
ultracool to work with, both House of Styles and Downlow for their advice
and support, the whole rest of the PBS crew - you folks rock and made
everything clic - the definition of a boombastic collectiv, and of
course, every single kid who came out and danced, shared a smile, a hug,
made new friends or simply chilled to the music - you're the greatest. :)

Short and sweet...that's it from me for now.
Since this is over, you can look for a new TECHNOLOGY to come out soon...

As for PBS....just one thing....
 "Its not ova mothafuckers!!!"

:P

(Disclaimer: Don't read this post if the notion of irresponsible ravers 
with lots of money and on lots of drugs disgusts and/or offends you)

----------------------------------------------------------------------


I still can't believe I even went to this party, since supposedly this 
was my 'month of no parties,' but I really think it's the ones we don't 
plan for, the ones which are completely spur-of-the-moment, that can be 
the most fun.

I usually don't share this much personal information, because I know 
there are people who might disagree strongly with some of the things I 
do -- but, I had a wonderful time and it's been so damn long since I've 
had this good a time that I'm telling the whole story with all the gory 
details.

We decided to go to Sproutin' after looking at the flyer in World 
Records in Columbus at around 9-ish Saturday night -- knowing we 
shouldn't spend the money, knowing we needed to get sleep instead, 
knowing what else we really shouldn't be doing that night ...

We didn't get there until after 2 AM, since we got a wee bit lost 
driving around the lake -- and when we did get there we realized just 
how COLD it was -- and it was very wet, and we were pretty 
uncomfortable.  We hadn't brought much money on purpose so little old me 
wouldn't go nuts paying for dealers to buy new cars, although my boy and 
I did split 3 little yellow pills (two MDE, and one MDA, as we were to 
discover later).  Yeah, yeah, this was my month of no E, and I was being 
bad (however I get worse).

We left the party around 5/5:30-ish and drove back up to my house, two 
hours away.  This is when things started getting out of control.  Okay, 
the first MDE pills had worn off -- BUT, we were still very awake, and 
strangely very talkative.  Hmm, weird eye-thingies going on too, yet we 
felt very 'with-it,' not at all as messed-up feeling as we had earlier.  
But we had only split that last yellow pill, hmm, ...which, come to 
think of it, did not at all feel like MDE.  Ah, so it must've been MDA.  
I got excited at this point because I hadn't had MDA since February, and 
we were both still incredibly awake, so we were like, "Hey -- let's 
drive back to the party!"

Our first stop was the bank, where I took out an ungoldy sum of money 
that I knew I should be saving, and then we were driving the two hours 
back to the party.  The music was going nuts at this point, and dancing 
felt awesome -- but I was on a bit of a mission right then.  Was 'MDA 
Guy' still there?  We looked and looked all around, until I got to the 
point where I said loudly, "Is anyone still selling E?" to which two 
different guys turned around and said, "I am."  Then I looked at their 
wares, with both of them assuring me, "This is pure MDMA -- I SWEAR!"  I 
asked the one guy, "How do you know for sure that what you have really 
is pure MDMA?"  Well, he threw back his shoulders and puffed out his 
chest and said, "'Cause I'm studying to be an UNDERGROUND CHEMIST!"  His 
girlfriend was beaming.  I tried not to laugh out loud.  Erik thought I 
should have been a snot and asked him what the main difference between 
the MDMA and MDA synthesis is, which could've been funny ... then again, 
maybe he really would have known.  Anyway, I didn't say anything.

So I was like, "Okay, I'll take two of yours," and to the other guy, 
"Two of yours also."  A few minutes later I bought two more off some 
girl.  

Over the course of the next eight hours -- well into late Sunday 
afternoon, we were hiking every single winding path all through the 
woods, in the hot sun, getting sunburnt, popping pills -- then going 
back to the party and talking to people, dancing -- it was a blast.  At 
one point we left the party for a little while to go swim in the lake 
(the real lake, not the little one at the party) and buy some juice.

Well, on Sunday -- all I had to eat was a peach and gallons of juice.  I 
got cold sores on my tongue, like I always do when I'm horribly 
sleep-deprived, over-drugged, and mal-nourished; and my face and 
shoulders are really, really sunburnt.  My legs still ache from trekking 
those miles up and down hills in the woods, and I have scratches from 
blackberry bushes -- not to mention all the nightmares I had last night 
-- probably a little left-over nasty side-effect from the chemicals ...

But I had a wonderful time, and it restored my faith in my ability to 
have a wonderful time.  

--Amanda

P.S. -- I'm not going to another party until Aug 15th, I SWEAR.

i'm not sure why, but there seems to me that there are negative attitudes
towards clubs amongst party kids around here.  (this is another reason why i
welcome atomic at metropol, in pittsburgh.)  it's just that i only know a few
people who attend both weekly and one-time-only events.    but maybe that's
because i don't know that many people ...

anyways, i was going to say i went to the pollinator (upstairs from the
oakland beehive) tonight in pittsburgh.  if you don't mind a latex-garbed
safety-pinned black-haired corset-donning clove-smoking crowd, which i happen
to think is sexy when done well, you should check it out.  the music is not
gothy, i promise!  it was industrial/trancey, i didn't stay long enough to
really spot anything ...

the "dj" there was playing with a machine that basically looked like a mixer
with two cd's on either side, with slides for disc a, disc b, aux/mic input
and a x-fader.  also i think i saw and heard punch-ins/outs.  each cd player
had a slide for pitch control.  basically it was like mixing records, but with
cd's so less manual control.  an interesting box.  

laga had less that two dozen people for steel city jungle.  saint sounded
good.  i don't feel like writing any more :P

wait no, i can say one more thing ... the live jungle sets i've heard lately
have been getting tighter and smoother.  i am not sure if i like this sound; i
guess i do since my interest is increasing.  but anyways, maybe it's cos when
i was younger, the only times i listened to drum n bass were at parties,
usually with dieselboy and 187 as the prime ministers ... i don't know what
dieselboy is up to now but these two had really ruff styles at the time (i
noticed a smoother sound from 187 last weekend  than i was used to also), with
lots of open ends - quicker transitions, zippier noticeable mixing, more x-
fader work.  

just something i noticed.  is it just me?

luv -
meee

Cheers for the compliments... most of what you heard was probably guest DJ
Angstboy...

I just wanted to talk about the "box" for a little, since not a night goes
by that I don't get questions about it.  It's a Vestax CDX-12, a uniquely
portable pro CD player.  It cost me about $1000.  It's got pitchshifters
(+/- 8%), a crossfader, auxiliary & mic inputs (so you could just use it
as a primitive mixer), and autocue (it finds the first "frame" of the
track with sound)... it also gives you to-the-frame control when cueing,
to ease beatmixing.  (A frame is 1/74th of a second on CDs.)

I'm surprised how many people are impressed by it; iot's actually pretty
primitive compared to, say, a Dennon 2500.  (New Dennon models allow you
to scratch (!), they count BPM, they can "grab" part of a track and loop
it, they can remember pre-programmed mixes, and they can cook you
breakfast.)

Since most industrial & EBM (my musical focus) comes on CD, I've been
learning to mix with CDs instead of vinyl like a "real DJ."  It's tough; 
you can never do the same tricks that you do with a record. 

Ironically, I can't play any of my records at the Pollinator yet because
they don't have house turntables.  Since I don't own a car, bringing my
own isn't an option.

P&G Flash Report
    
The KKK is endorsed by Procter and Gamble, who also supports the 
satanists, and who sold Mrs. Field's cookie recipe to Neiman Marcus 
for $2,000 after the kiddie tatoos laced with LSD that were supposed 
to be used for satanic ritual abuse at that day care center in 
Beaufort were mistakenly eaten by the choking doberman who was bitten 
by the snake that came out of the fur coat that was worn by the 
escaped homicidal maniac whose hook prosthesis was found hanging from 
the door of the car of the teenagers who high-tailed it out of a 
lover's lane when they heard that he had escaped and then went to the 
pot party where the kids who were supposed to be babysitting got high 
on marijuana and were so stoned they accidentally put the baby in the 
oven instead of the turkey that makes you sleepy because it contains 
tryptophan because the microwave was ruined by the exploding poodle 
that the girl with the beehive hairdo that turned out to contain 
roaches who had gotten an automatic "A" at college because her 
roommate had committed suicide had put in to dry after it had gotten 
wet chasing the vanishing hitchhiker who had tried to warn the girl 
that her insides were cooked because she had stayed too long under the 
sun lamp at the local tanning salon while her dad poured a load of 
concrete into a new convertible parked outside of the house because he 
thought it belonged to a guy who was having sex with his wife but was 
really a prize he had won in a contest at that radio station that 
played rock records that contained hidden commands and subliminal 
messages planted by the Jews, international bankers, the Trilateral 
Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Illuminati, the New 
World Order, multinational corporations, right wing militias, Jerry 
Falwell, the Christian Coalition, Planned Parenthood, and the spooks 
at Hanger 18 of Area 51 in Dreamland who performed the autopsies on 
the aliens who crashed at Roswell, New Mexico while on a mission to 
abduct people and conduct weird sexual and reproductive experiments on 
them because they knew we use only ten percent of our brains and that 
engineers had "proven" that bumblebees can't fly and that sugar wakes 
you up even if you're a CIA agent who has recovered memories about 
conspiring with organized crime and anti-Castro extremists to kill JFK 
with a magic bullet, and then killed dozens of other people whose odds 
of all dying within the period in which they did are infintesimal even 
if you don't count their near-death experiences in which an angel 
guided them to the light before they were called back because it 
wasn't time for them to die like Mikey from the Life cereal 
commercials did after eating Pop Rocks(R) candy when his friend Alice 
Cooper who was Eddie Haskell on Leave it to Beaver woke up after a one 
night stand in a hotel only to find that the girl he was with was gone 
and had written "Welcome to the world of AIDS" in lipstick on the 
bathroom mirror which terrified him because he knew that it is just as 
easy to get AIDS from heterosexual intercourse as it is from 
homosexual sodomy with an IV drug user because when the US government 
created AIDS to commit genocide against blacks who aren't adversely 
affected by the minimum wage with the aid of Korean grocers who don't 
give anything back to the community they knew that Anne Klein had said 
on the Donahue show that she didn't want blacks buying her clothes 
because when the poison they put in that fried chicken at Church's so 
The Rich could keep the poor down because they can't be rich if nobody 
is poor there would be a massive coverup like the Philadelphia 
Experiment or the carburetor that can allow a car to get 100 mpg in 
perpetual motion just like Nikola Tesla had done a hundred years ago 
using the same principal that Uri Geller uses to bend spoons and 
psychic friends use to give you valuable insights that improve your 
life for amusement purposes only while smoking a cigarette that has no 
more been proven to give you cancer than evolution has been proven to 
occur because it's only a theory and there are no transitional fossils 
and it violates the second law of thermodynamics unlike creation 
science which is not religious and fear of irradiated food which is 
rational because we know it's bad just like the assault weapons that 
are more dangerous than other semi-automatic weapons because they look 
scary and ugly and they're ok to ban because the second amendment 
wasn't meant to preserve the rights of individuals against the state 
like the other nine amendments in the Bill of Rights but instead is 
the only amendment designed to protect the state against individuals 
because if there is no effective way to keep guns out of the hands of 
criminals the next best thing is to keep them out of the hands of law 
abiding citizens and make sure only the state has them because 
countries where the state doesn't permit its citizens to own guns are 
never oppressive and the government doesn't become arrogant and 
intractable and corrupt because the government can improve our lives 
by suspending the laws of supply and demand to make prices fair and 
deciding how many people of each race and sex should be in colleges 
and jobs which is good because when control of everyday life is 
centralized in the state the people who get to make the decisions are 
never capricious or highhanded or make decisions favoring their 
friends and family and people who pay them money because if only we 
can get the right people into positions of control it will be safe to 
let them run things because smart people can figure out how to 
allocate resources and what fair prices are for goods and services and 
labor and who should be allowed to do what much more efficiently and 
constructively than just letting millions of people make their own 
decisions about what they should eat or drink or smoke or for whom 
they should work for under what conditions for how much money on what 
schedule based on their own perceptions concerns and plans in 
accordance with their best interests.

But I digress...

bump is a weekly event at soba in pittsburgh with resident dj's 7up and zemo.
the dance floor is really small - about the size of a uhaul - so usually there
is some spillage of dancers into the lounge.  but the 5-star boys had the
place jumpin with some straight up hard house.  i like seeing fly dancers in
the no-dancing zone :)

much later this evening, i john brommage drove by as i was out for a walk ...
he hollered while zipping away that atomic )tomorrow night at metropol, in the
strip district of pittsburgh) is $2 for 21+ ... he was too far away for me to
ask about cover for under-21 kids :)

can anyone tell me about trilogy in cleveland?  what time does it shut down?
is there a dress code?  are backpacks and water bottles okay?  should we
expect to pay for parking?  is it 18+?  are there afterparties?

what's happening to me?  i don't know why i go out so much these days, and why
i tend to go to similar places.  but, ... whatever :\

>>A San Anselmo, California, man died when he hit a lift tower at the

>22-year
>>old David Hubal was pronounced dead at Centinela Mammoth Hospital. The
>>accident occurred about 3 a.m., The Mono County Sheriff's Department
>said.
>>Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run called Stump
>Alley
>>and undid some yellow foam protectors from lift towers, said Lt. Mike
>>Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The pads are used to
>>protect skiers who might hit towers.The group apparently used the pads
>to
>>slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. It has since
>been
>>investigated and determined the tower he hit was the one with its pad
>>removed.

>>4th Runner-up:
>>
>>Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St. Louis
>>market when the clerk threatened to call the police. Puelo grabbed a
>>hot dog, shoved it into his mouth, and walked out without paying.
>>Police found him unconscious in front of the store where paramedics
>>removed the six-inch wiener from his throat where it had choked him to
>>death.
>>
>>
>>3rd Runner-up:
>>
>>Poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, shot a stag standing above him on an
>>overhanging rock and was killed instantly when it fell on him.
>>
>>
>>2nd Runner-up:
>>
>>A man at a West Virginia party (probably related to the man in
>>Arkansas who used the 22 bullet to replace the fuse in his pick-up
>>truck) popped a blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering
>>an explosion that blew off his lips, teeth, and tongue. Jerry
>>Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank during the
>>party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne. "Another man had it in
>an
>>aquarium hooked to a battery and was trying to explode it, said
>>Payne. "It wouldn't go off and this guy said I'll show you how to set
>>it off. "He put it into his mouth and bit down. It blew all his teeth
>>out and his lips and tongue off, Payne said. Stromyer was listed in
>>guarded condition Wednesday with extensive facial injuries, according
>to a
>>spokesperson at Charleston Area Medical Division. "I just can't imagine
>>anyone doing  something like that, Payne said.
>>
>>
>>1st Runner-up:
>>
>>Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregon man shot
>>through the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be
>>released soon from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye
>>last weekend during an initiation into a man's rafting club,
>>Mountain Men Anonymous (probably known now as Stupid Mountain Men
>Anonymous)
>>in Grants Pass, Oregon. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his
>head,
>but
>>the arrow entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said had the  arrow had
>gone
>1
>>mm. to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut* and Roberts
>would
>>have died instantly.
>>Neurosurgeon Doctor Johnny Delashaw at the University Hospital in
>>Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 in. of brain with the tip
>>protruding at the rear of his skull, yet somehow managed to miss all
>>major blood vessels. Delashaw also said had Roberts tried to pull the
>>arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself. Roberts
>>admitted afterwards he and his friends had been drinking that
>>afternoon. (DUH). Said Roberts, "I feel so dumb about this".  No
>>charges have been filed but the Josephine County district attorney's
>>office said the initiation stunt is under investigation.

>>
>>Last year's winner, you will remember, was the fellow who was killed
>>when he attached a JATO (Jet Assisted Take Off) unit to his Chevy
>>Impala and shot himself and his car into a desert cliff at 300 M.P.H.
>>
>>
>>                    ..now this year's winners:
>>
>>(The late) John Pernicky and his friend, (the late) Sal Hawkins, of
>>the great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica
>>concert  at the George Washington amphitheater. Having no tickets
>>(but having had 18 beers between them), they thought it would be easy
>to
>>"hop" over  the 9 ft. fence and sneak into the show. They pulled their
>>pick-up truck over to the fence and the plan was for (the late) Mr.
>Pernicky
>>(who was 100 pounds heavier than Mr. Hawkins) to hop the fence and then
>>assist his friend over. Unfortunately for (the late) Mr. Pernicky,
>there
>was
>>a 30 ft. drop on the other side of the fence. Having heaved himself
>over,
>he
>>found himself crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted
>(and
>>broken, along with his arm, as it were) by a large branch that snagged
>him
>>by his shorts. Dangling from the tree with a broken arm, he looked down
>and
>>saw some bushes below him. (Possibly) figuring the bushes would break
>his
>>fall, he removed his pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts
>to
>>free himself from the tree.  Finally free, (did I mention he is THE
>LATE)
>>Mr. Pernicky crashed into Holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his
>>ENTIRE body and now without the protection of his shorts, a Holly
>branch
>>penetrated his rectal cavity. To make matters worst (?!), on
>landing,his
>>pocket knife penetrated his thigh 3-inches. (The late) Mr. Hawkins, on
>>seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony, decided to throw him
>a
>>rope and pull him to safety (now he thinks of the "S" word) by tying
>the
>>rope to the pick-up truck and slowly driving away. However, in his
>drunken
>>haste/state, he put the truck into reverse and crashed through the
>fence
>>landing on his friend and killing him. Police arrived to find the
>crashed
>>pick-up with its driver thrown 100 ft. from the truck and dead at the
>scene
>>from massive internal injuries. Upon moving the truck, they found John
>under
>>it, half-naked with scratches on his body,  a holly stick in his
>rectum, a
>>knife in his thigh, and his shorts dangling from a tree branch 25-feet
>in
>>the air.

Heres one vote for #pb-cle-raves on efnet (irc server irc.cs.cmu.edu) to
be the offical irc channel to compliment this list.  Being that I often
idle on irc it would be nice to have some companionship here! If you need
any help connectiong from aol or any other isp you can email me.  In
addition for those of you who are enlightened, the best irc client imho is
Ircle and yes its only made for the Macintosh!  For more information

Okay,

I let this one go for two whole evenings. But I have _got_ to say
something. True to the disclaimer, I was a bit disgusted when I read this,
and I almost sent something really mean to this list. But as I let time
pass, the disgust wore off, and I think that was only an initial
reaction. The true feeling is not one of digust, but one of true
disturbance. I am not disgusted or offended by this post, I am deeply
_disturbed_.

I just want to say that this post revealed to me not only that I was
disturbed by the way in which partying and raves were portrayed below, but
the way in which NO ONE on this list reacted in any positive or negative
way. What is going on, people? Does no one care that the people that we
are partying next to are behaving in ways that are irresponsible (your
word, Amanda), and _self-destructive_? Or is this the way that _everyone_
parties and I am just out of the loop (or never in it to begin with)??
Because, personally, I believe that the pattern of behavior described
below is not only irresponsible and destructive not only to one's self,
but to the scene as a whole. This is the kind of shit that your parents
say goes on at raves and we all vehemently deny (or say "oh yeah, everyone
else does it, but I don't"). Or maybe you straight up tell your parents
the truth--if this IS the truth. Is the media right, are our parents
right: that we are all hedonistic, irresponsible, drug-abusing,
self-destructive kids just wasting our money and lives away? 

I am not saying that drugs are bad and they give this scene a bad name.
What I am saying is that if we are going to _represent_ this scene (and
we certainly do if we are posting our business to a mailing list that
can be accessed by anyone around the world at any time), maybe we should
think twice about the message that we are sending. But then again, why
withhold the truth if this is truly the way that one experiences the
scene. Someone please tell me that this is the exception and not the rule,
because if it IS the rule, then we need to get a fucking grip.

i really dont see why it has to be such an issue... this list is about
pittsburgh/cleveland raves, so that's what should be discussed, and i
really dont think that each individual list member should consider
themselves and official ambassadors to the rave scene or anything and
be careful about what they say because of it. the truth makes more
sense to me.

<obvious>the scene means a lot of different things to a lot of
different people</obvious> and i think that each individual perception
is what should be "represented" on the list, because that is what the
scene we are discussing is comprised of.

ok, that's it. after 80 billion posts about "what's everyone's irc name" 
"why isn't anyone on chat?" it's finally become too much.

>to all of you who have not checked out #pb-cle-raves on efnet(irc)
>which is not very many of you seeing no one is ever in there. 
irc is for people that don't have much of a life or can't get out their 
parents' house. some of us have better things to do than spend hours and 
hours on irc. (for me it's class, djing, my radio show, work, & chilling 
w/ friends)
why not just call up some of the people you've been chatting with and 
hang out w/ them in person??? (since it is the pb-cle channel, there 
must be some people in your area.) 

>boom you are in and if everybody does it you will be talking to a 
>bunch of cool ravers!!!
you will be talking to a bunch of ravers, but I wouldn't say that 
they're cool. like hello?

yo, don't get so discouraged. I think the summer is a bad time for pgh 
club nights since most of the college students have gone home. 
seriously, scj seems to be supported by the cmu ravers (there are quite 
a few) and I only know of 2 or 3 that have stayed in pgh for the summer. 
so don't give up, just wait until august 24th, when school starts up 
again for us =)

I think it's good to be careful about what you say since the list is 
*not* private. The archives are posted up on the web and if your parents 
(or the popo or the fbi, whoever) were savy enough to run a search for 
say, "erica coslor" on hotbot.com, they would come up with all my posts 
to pb-cle, in addition to my webpage & all my public shit. 
maybe people should be more careful about what they're posting or maybe 
there shouldn't be archives anywhere. opinions?

Most people I talk to on IRC are in the same situation as me:  we work a
desk job, we have Internet access.  From 9-5 on IRC you can meet some
fairly intelligent people.

I think we're the minority, though.

yeah...  you can't incriminate yourself...  i can tell anyone i wan't,
including the popo, fbi, and anyone else, that i've dropped acid, sped
on the highway, and ran a red light...  they can't do jack shit... and
that's assuming that the fbi or whoever even knows/cares who i am...
which they don't..  people have a lot more important things to worry
about than a couple of raver kidz having a good time xing or tripping or
whatever, right?

i also liked the earlier post saying that we aren't abassadors to the
rave scene..  were not roll models.. we never claimed to be, nor asked
to be...  i'm going to lunch right now and will probably spout off some
more mail when i get back..

Good idea!  Honestly I'm suprised hyperreal would have archives . . .
seems like they would understand what you are saying.  I would feel a
lot safer with no archives . . . at least no archives easily accessed
by ppl not on the list.

I will kill the president of the united states at 14:30.34 EDT 23 APR 99
in the city of Compton, LA.

will my life go down the drain?  will they be ready?

i'm not being an ass...i just wanted to see if there are any computers
scanning all of the lists on the internet for specific data.  some
massive underground robotic search mechanism.

I think that you missed my point. My point is not that, as list members,
we are "ambassadors to the rave scene," but rather that as list members,
our experiences reflect what goes on in the scene. The "message that we
are sending" that I am referring to, is the generalized _experience_ of
ingesting copious amounts of drugs (i call it abuse), irresponsibility,
 and self-destruction that this particular email revealed as
part of this scene. Something that you, (or anyone else since),
have not commented on, which was the MAJOR point of my post (not detection
by "outsiders" through archives, etc).

The club should shut down around 3:30 AM.  No dress code, actually if you
go up in the cage you don't even have to wear clothes!  no containers
allowed in the club. not sure about backpacks.  you can park on the side
streets for free where a bunch of drunk assholes with god complexes will be
checking out what you got inside (it's really not that bad, i guess I am
just paranoid) or there are lots for $6. It is all ages.  No afterhours as
of now!

I think as we're finding out with this, that the majority of the people
involved couldn't give a rat's ass about issues regarding representation,
responsibility, or the long-term interests of anything other than
themselves.  "Do your own thing, man."  "I don't care what anyone else
does, as long as it doesn't affect me."

Open your eyes, people.  Things don't happen in a vacuum.

>Someone please tell me that this is the exception and not the rule,
>because if it IS the rule, then we need to get a fucking grip.

On what... reality?  This _is_ the reality of the situation.  As has passed
in generations of scenes before ours, the torch of majority passes from the
early experimenters to the idealists, and then eventually to the
mainstream.  Raves have ceased to be some idealistic happyfluffybunny land
of responsible experimentation and expression... and have become the
populist young's idea of a good time.

And as the record labels continue to push our music ever so much further
into the hands of everyday people, what was originally something that you
had to seek out and appreciate has become something you're force-fed to
consume.  Techno is becoming the new pop in the states, and the current
crop of people you see at parties lately is but one casualty of this.

As exemplified by events like Family Affair, the soul of the party has
ceased to be about music.  It's now about kids having a cool place to hang
out with their friends and do drugs.  All else becomes secondary.

There are of course exceptions, but I feel in this situation that majority
does rule.  This is what raving is like in America today.

Drugs and socialization have always been an intregal part of our scene, but
as history has shown us... drugs usually wind up consuming all.  If coke
killed disco, will GHB and meth be recorded as our smoking gun?  As these
kids grow up and (hopefully) get real jobs, their previous limitations
regarding access to these chemicals because of them being too expensive
will be eliminated... and as they then either decide to become more
responsible or intoxicated, usually they simply drop out.

Those that are left are easily outnumbered by the new people constantly
coming in.  Fresh faces.  Fresh bodies.  Fresh cravings.

And what is provided to these people is exactly what they've been taught to
believe and in fact is what they've come to these events to expect.  It's a
self-fulfilling prophecy of sadness and destruction.

What, then, are we to get a grip on.

you probably will regret that...  i'm not even going to quote that in my

 in this country you can say any goddamn mutherfucking thing you want
(pardon my free speech), EXCEPT for that.. i hope for your sake no one
important sees that...  that is a federal offense, and it is very
possible that the Secret Service could show up at your door at any time
in the future and arrest you...  i'm not being paranoid or stupid, i'm
being serious...  especially with the fact we are dicussing the fact
that this list is archived for god knows how long... that could come
back to haunt you...

once again, not to spoil your fun, but i don't think that was the most
intelligent thing you've ever done...

nevertheless,

before i refute anything in this post, i just want to thank Craig for
posting it, because it makes us take a good look at what we are doing,
and think about why.  my first reaction to this post was, "you're so
wrong", but that's not totally true...  now, the rebuttal:

ok, i believe that as long as i am responsible for myself and my own
behavior, that is enough.  i can't stop someone from taking a nasty
concoction of drugs and whigging the fuck out, causing a problem, or
just having a grand ol' time.  i can try and help them if something bad
happens, or enjoy the experience with them if it is good...  i have
never made it my business to be reponsible for anyone other than myself,
because no one else is responsible for me.

being a member of the populist young, i don't think that is true...  for
most people, the idea of a good time is not a rave..  most people i've
met assume that ravers are a bunch of wierdos, dancing funny and taking
strange drugs that they've never heard of and have no idea what they
do..  most young people want a dance club, a much less intimidating
scene...  also, electronic music still isn't all that mainstream.. the
knowledge that it exists certainly is, but it is not that popular.. 
there are no commercial techno stations...  there are however a huge
number of soft rock, "alternative", and hip-hop stations...  that is
popular music..

well, what's the solution?  tell people not to take drugs at a rave? 
not gonna happen.  start a "strait-edge" rave scene?  possibly.  people
will do what they want when they want because they want to.  that's the
way it works..  and i don't see it changing any time soon.  its
immediate gratification, and i don't see anything wrong with it, as long
as there is some long term gratification in there, too...  "everything
in moderation, including moderation" -ben franklin (i think)  work your
9-5 all week, then friday and saturday, get fucked upo out of your
skull, it's your god-given right...  as long as people understand it's
back to the grind on monday, there is no problem.

well, those are my thoughts, right or wrong.

Well then allow me to retort.  Am I not allowed to share a personal 
experience with this list?  Did I in any way indicate that I think 
others should follow suit and do what I did?  Did I in any way indicate 
that this is what I do every weekend?  Haven't you ever just gone nuts, 
just for the hell of it, just ONCE?  No, this was not the average party 
weekend for me, and I thought I had made that clear -- but no matter.  
This isn't my point.  

As far as I'm concerned, this is the huge whopping voice of the 
hypocritical alcohol culture talking here, much more than someone 
terribly concerned about the 'scene. '  Sounds a little more like "What 
about the children?!!!" to me.

Quite the contrary, mon cherie -- I received several quite positive 
personal replies.  :-)


 What is going on, people? Does no one care that the people that we
>are partying next to are behaving in ways that are irresponsible (your
>word, Amanda), and _self-destructive_? 

Did I mention that I do not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes?  Did I 
mention that ecstasy is the only drug I ever consume -- twice a month at 
most?  Perhaps I didn't mention that because I didn't think it would 
have lended anything to my story.  According to my doctor, I'm in 
perfect health -- but who cares?  That's some boring stuff, right there.

(As for the whole "Watch out -- 'They're' watching you" scenario -- if 
anyone were to do a search on my name, they wouldn't find ANYTHING -- 
because my real last name has never appeared in a post.  I think this 
negates the whole "what if my parents found out" thing which someone 
brought up.  Not like my parents are my keepers anymore anyway ...)

well when i redid the archives, i found that hotbot cant find stuff there.
i dunno if you can request to be removed from a search engine, i kinda
doubt it, and it would be a pain in the ass since there's a new one popping
up every day.

yes you can.  anything you say to a cop is admissible in court.  you just
cant testify against yourself (or spouse) in court.
i guess stuff in your medical record isnt 100% private, alot ends up in a
database in ummmm,,,,, is it boston?   and a court order can force a doctor
to cough up stuff in it (ummm ya i did coke, will that interfere with my
prozac????)    just think about what you say and how you word it i guess?

Which is exactly why I use hotmail. It sure as hell isn't

Yes, and that kind of thing definitely does go on in the scene.

So, what exactly are you saying? That we shouldn't discuss certain
topics on the list because of possible bad public relations? Or
that people shouldn't do excessive amounts of drugs at raves?

but if i post it to the net, and not specifically to a cop, what's to
stop me from saying "hehe, i was just kidding about all that acid and
extasy stuff, your honor."  then it's my word against my word, right? 
how are they gonna get you on perjury when they have no evidence?  

can they really do anything about a statement such as "i have taken
acid"?  It doesn't seem like they would be able to get away with
arresting you for something along those lines.  it just seems to general.

i just will never understand why the government wants to regulate what i
do to myself and my body.  it isn't any of their business what drugs i
take.  i am a legal adult of sound mind and body and i should be able to
do anything i want as long as it doesn't affect anyone else.  20/20 did
a great special a little while ago called "consenting adults".  it was
really good, did anyone else catch it?  it was all about how
prostitution, homosexuality (through sodomy laws), gambling, and drugs
should be legalized because they don't hurt anyone other than the person
doing it..

Just a few points in response:  I see where you're coming from - I feel
the same way about things in the rave scene at times.   People acting
stupid or irresponsible is majorly annoying because, in a very real way,
it makes it harder for the kids there 100% into the music.   That's just
in a practicle sense - if i'm going to an 'event' of any other subculture
cept' maybe a 'keg party' or 'oz fest', the chance of it getting busted is
very very very small.  At any rave, even a big one, there's a significant
chance it will either be busted, or some depressing incident will occur.

On another level, i just don't feel happy seeing the rave scene exist as a
side show to a drug culture, which is how i see it sometimes. Personally,
I have no problem with drugs, but their importance to the rave scene is
just too great.  But that's my opinion and I respect the right of others
to have their own.

After seeing X-amount of unconscious, overdrugged kids, both happy and
unhappy, it becomes 'old news'. Even on this list, threads about
moderation and drugs in general have come up probably 12-15 times.  To
summerize:  some people like drugs. some people use them with moderation,
others go all out, a few never do any. there's nothing much you can do to
persuade a person either way, although speading knowledge and experiences
with a bit of wisdom is good. The discussions inevitably die off, but
there's never a 'solution', because there is no way to make everyone
agree.

I think if people share their experiences and knowledge on this list, its
a good thing.  As Frankie said - we're not ambassadors, merely *some* of
the kids that make up the scene.  Of course, take everything you read here
with a grain ov thee sodium chloride....

> self-destructive kids just wasting our money and lives away? 

Some are, some aren't.  Some are in between.  
There are far nobler things than the rave scene.  My over all opinion is
that ravin' is seen my people as just 'another thing to do' ( a very fun
one). Anything more special/creative beyond that is going to be smaller
and the product of a few ingenius/devious minds....

One last thing, in reguard to "who could read whats on this list":
my opinion is that if you're afraid your parents or authorities will read
what you post/write/say and get you in trouble, then don't say it.
however, if you really believe in your actions, what you say in
'underground' bbs's or whatever, then stick up for yourself and what you
believe - you'll feel alot better than if you hide it.

As far as i see, the pattern of things in pittsburgh is really erratic.
When college is in, there are more college kids in pgh, and more at clubs.
Sometimes that is, unless they have a test the next day.  Of course high
school kids can't go out during school, but often can in the summer.
Unless they're grounded or can't get a ride.

In the past its been goofy...if i remember right, 168 did ok in the spring
when college was still in, and was boomin' during the summer when the old
SCJ was going on...but slowly dwindled away until almost noone came by the
end of the summer/early fall.

When laga used to do that fri night thing, it did good when college was
in, and had some really good ones in the summer, but it ended before
school started in the fall again.

Even SCJ in its laga incarnation: it was majorly boomin when it first
started (last summer i think), and stayed pretty big through 97, but its
seemed to taper off this year, especially the past few months (theres no
particular reason for it, but its seemed slower ever since that
specialk/skibadee night)....although it was quite wicked and fun when
circuit 6 played there last.

Whatever the logic behind it...i hope SCJ keeps happening in some
form....its really the best thing in pgh for the past 2 years.

Hey Geoffrey, in all the years I went to parties, I saw just about 
everything.  I can honestly say that in most parties, a good 60% of 
people have to get messed up in the "sake of having a good time"  ask 
the day after what their favorite DJ was it is "Huh?"  Ask what their 
favorite set was was "uuuuhhhhhh."  Ask what their favorite type of 
techno is "I think.... uh, what did you ask me?"  Or worse "Last night? 
What was last night?"  Oh geez, I know, worsTe case scenario,
but hell, I have seen it up close and personal and think "If I play 
Hardcore and put Top 40 on will anyone notice?"  Answer is probably not.

MDEA must be the best-kept secret around, because lately it's what 
you'll get sold to you as "E" about 60-80% of the time and people still 
have no clue it exists.

What this flame/rant session really boils down to is freedom of speech.

Should the free exchange of opinions and information on the Internet by 
controlled? Whether this control is enforced by the federal government 
or by ourselves, as a list community, it amounts to the same thing. 
Censorship.

You either believe in complete freedom of speech or you don't.

Drug excesses are nothing new, neither taking the moral highground.
Can I get off my soap-box now?

now, i know you guys aren't all druggies, and i'm not saying that you are,
but this is the best place i could think to look.

i'm looking for either surplus seldane or a pharmacy that will fill a
perscription for it. i need 60mg or 120mg pills, NOT capsules. it
absolutely MUST be real perscription stuff if it's surplus. 

the reason i'm looking is that i have a perscription for seldane, 60mg
pills. however, the pharmacy that i have my health care plan with will no
longer fill my seldane perscriptions (yet they have no trouble filling my
bloody percoset perscriptions). to date, i've been unable to find anywhere
that will fill the perscription for a reasonable amount (i don't care what
they tell you, 30 60mg pills of seldane is not worth $180. when it was
easy to get, it was about $40, if that) and i'm starting to run low on
pills. 

yes, i have tried claritin, zoloft, and all those others that claim to be
as powerful, if not more powerful than seldane. one of them interacts
fatally with other perscriptions of mine, and the other two have
absolutely no effect on my allergies. so i really do need seldane. also,
fyi, it is not a banned substance. however, due to the massive amount of
bad press generated, it's hard to find. if anybody wants more info, drop
me an email. thanks.

We have probably had this conversation before and I dont want a flame war 
but I still feel the need to comment.

I think a lot of people will agree with me when I say that SCJ has been 
loosing.  The scene itself changes a LOT and having a dedicated night to a 
dedicated genre of rave/electronica is just not going to last.  The biggest 
comment I hear on scj from people that dont go or went once was that 'you 
have to be a die hard jungle fan to enjoy it'.  Which I am not. Im not 
bashing it, if you like jungle go to it. But I think that if it was more 
varied with different styles at different times and more 'regularly 
enjoyed' techno it would be a hit.  If it changed to an electronica night 
with mixtures of rave/house/breakbeat/jungle/GABBER<grin>/etc atleast for a 
little while you could figure out what crowd IS interested in and change it 
to that night. There is no reason that you cant play jungle on a style like 
that.  But the club scene is not designed for djs who want to play what 
they want to play. It is designed for djs who want to play what the crowd 
wants to hear.  Not that having guest djs spin what they want to spin is a 
bad thing.

This was why I stopped going to laga on wednesday nights. You had to be a 
die hard sway-oh-my-god-i-broke-a-fang goth/etherial lover to enjoy the 
music.  And when you are under 21 thats about all there is to go for, the 
music.

Me personally, im sticking with the Polinator on tuesdays. I cant afford 
more then one club night a week, the music is varied enough that I am bound 
to hear SOMETHING I like throughout the night, and I dont have to figure 
out if this tuesday is an offnight or not.
Its a bummer that its only 21+, I think if something replaced scj as 
weekly, all ages, and variety of electronica music it would rock ass.

I miss friday nights at laga from last year, what shmuck didnt put it back 
for during the school year?

You know, I am a die hard jungle fan, but I have to say, I don't know how
its gotten this far without this happening.   I'd like to believe that
pittsburgh can continually support an all jungle night, but realistically 
i just don't think we can indefinitely unless its djs playing for free at
some free space (a good option to me).   Of course i don't know the
economics, so really, who am i to talk?

Even a night that always featured 1-2 junglists and then 1-2 other djs -
related in some way, like ragga jungle + dancehall, or hardstep + hiphop,
or dark + techno, or techstep + gabber, or oldskool + happy hardcore might
go over better in the long run....although its deciededly hit or miss no
matter what style you're playing, so i can understand trying to stay true
to you're concept.

just thoughts,
 geoff

does anyone remember what philosopher was known for this theory?  I
think he lived around 300 or 400 yrs ago. His thoughts were pretty much
the same as those above.

The argument makes a lot of sense, but otoh, it's not that simple
either.  There are too many indirect effects that _do_ affect society
that are related to some of these issues.  

You also have to remember that this runs into the fact that there is no
obvious line where government intervention should stop.  The world will
never agree where it lies b/c it's a matter of personal philosophy.
In fact, that's one of the large differences that fuel the largest two
american parties today.  along with monica lewinsky of course:)

I'm sure a lot of people will argue this point (or will at least think
about it).  One of the reasons that clubs die (at least in the summer) in
Pittsburgh has GOT to be that so many of the club-goers go home.  There
must be a large college pull.  I realize that we, as a scene, can be
fickle and ornery, but doesn't the lack of college session at least
account for some of the loss?

In a message dated 98-07-30 22:22:23 EDT, you write:

RIGHT ON!!

As form the 20/20 special... I heard it was good but could hardly believe it
after their horrible/one sided story on "raves".

     uh, originally, i sent this email to a few 
     people who i thought might be interested, so as
     not to dump a huge message on everyone (or annoy
     any it might implicate) but since one of those
     people replied to the list, i (and they) thought
     i might as well post it.

     god i get longwinded. never say with a few words

Subject: just say, um, no, and stuff

     ok, thought i'd share this with you people, just
     needed to get my thoughts out in writing. lemme
     know what you think, if you want, whatever.

     last night i was at somebody's house party. i
     have no idea whose house (or party) it was, but
     these are general observations anyway.

     anyway, i wasn't really there of my own accord;
     tom sorta dragged me there as we had some things
     to work out and it seemed an appropriate place to
     talk, etc.

     someone had a set of 1200s set up through a portable
     stereo (!) which was still loud enough to be painful,
     and various people were having fun spinning various
     things. tom spun first, after which we worked out what
     we had to (the lineup for an upcoming rave, actually)
     and he and john left.

     at this point the party began to degenerate.

     basically, everybody was in various stages of
     inebriation. it was, well, pretty pitiful, actually.
     there were several brainless beauties (in the true
     extreme) which was fun for all of five minutes.
     there was one little kid who couldn't have been 
     more that 15 years old who was walking into things
     and muttering strange things. there seemed to be an
     endless supply of cheap beer in the basement.

     anyway... 

     there was, of course, universal proliferation of
     the fratboy standard, your friendly little leaf,
     which i as usual ignored. but when the pills came
     out i instantly became interested. :]

     i asked the kid who seemed to have procured the
     little white 120mg or so tablets what exactly they
     were. 

     'oh, he says, they're yellow submarines.'
     'no,' i say, 'what ARE they, not what your pet name
      is for something that looks like something that your
      dealer said was cool.' 
     'the ingredients?'
     'yeah.'
     'so, you know, like, what they are?'
     'well, i know what they DO. like, is it mdm, mde, mda.'
     'i dunno.'
     'you don't know? does the person you got them from
      know?'
     'probably. he's inside.'
     'well, do you know somewhere i can get pure mdma?'
     'no, but i know where you can get pure mda.'
     'yeah?' (hmmm. interesting)
     'yeah, it's like pure powder with crystals in it.'
     'ok. so what do you think the pills you had were, mde?'
     'what's mde?'
     'it's um, mdea, like a semi-legal version of mdma.'
     'well, it could be that. i just know that i had some
      mda once and it made me really sick.'
   (cute girl who had just taken one of his pills) 'really?'
     'yeah, i was like vomiting for two hours.'
   (me) 'well, i don't think it was pure mda, probly 
     something else.'

     at this point this _wacked_ looking guy with one of 
     those soft eyeshade things and big pants, bleached
     hair, etc. takes over the conversation.

     'yeah man, it's like impossible to get pure mdma 
      around here, man.'
     'so where can you get it?'
     'well, you gotta go up to new york, or down south.'
     'down south?' (WTF, i thought all they did down there
      was moonshine and hemp)
     'yeah, like north carolina and maybe florida.'
     'ok. so there's none around here.'
     'nah, it's really hard to find.'
     'so what DO you get around here, mde?'
     'mde?'
     'yeah, um, eve, y'know?' (whatever :P)
     'well, you know those limes, y'ever had one of those?'
     'sure.' 
     'they're, like, 50 percent smack.'
     'oh, really?'
     'yeah.'

     end of THAT conversation. everyone seemed really 
     impressed with my drug knowledge, although i hardly
     did anything except identify a few acronyms. i dunno 
     what to make of it, except that even the people who 
     do this shit a _lot_ (that is, much more than myself)
     haven't a clue about what they are actually doing
     to their systems.

     oh well. it was educational, if hardly a very fun 
     experience. everyone was drunk and thus very 
     obnoxious. the only girl worth talking to left and
     i split soon after. <wry grin> reminded me why i 
     quit going to these parties. i used to just go and
     get totally sloshed, and sit in a corner and make
     fun of chicks who were so drunk they thought it was
     cute. :P

     blah. parttyyyy. why did i ever think this was 
     cool?

     later,
     geekboy

     yeah, but i checked the NSA (me and my friends
     cracked them wide open with the buffer overflow
     bug in the login daemon on netBSD) and they say:

     'not a potential threat...excessive exposure to
     subversive music has eliminated some of control
     programming induced in childhood television 
     viewing, but still unlikely to cause any problems.
     monitor status inactive.'

     i'm not sure what the last bit is. then there's
     a bunch of stuff about not being held enough as
     a child. are children supposed to be held? all i
     can remember is being dropped...

eric justin (x-on) and finger.  Do they still spin?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Also: what former pgh djs would people like to see play here again?

Trilogy used to be *the* place to go in Cleveland when big rave clubs were
in (maybe 5 yrs ago)...they held Sundays there:  The Church.  Anyway, now
it's normally house music & ravers in the small room in back, and a mix of
a few ravers w/ jocks & alterna-kids & run-of-the-mill club kids in the big
room.  Hard telling what kind of crowd will go tomorrow...more party\raver
kids, I expect.  Robert de la Gaultier will spin until 3 or so, but they
sometimes stay open later on weekends.  No dress code.  (It used to be a
big "club kid" dressing club.)  Backpacks OK.  Water bottles...not sure. 
Parking is general parking for the Flats (Cleveland's big late-night
club/bar/concert area.)  Pay for parking or expect your car to get broken
into (or at least puked on).  I haven't heard 18+, but call to make sure. 
Afterparty?  I sure hope so...

Then it's time for the ones that would rather not have this be the reality
to drop out of the "scene" described below.  Parties can still be crafted
that aren't like this; they just may not be able to be as large as Family
Affair had gotten.  Techno in America isn't yet techno in Europe. 
Budweiser and Nike don't throw parties here yet.  We still have some
control.

skylab 2000 and tommy sunshine are probably the least significant people at
this event.  if you decide to not go because of this, then there is something
wrong with you.  robert hood, juan atkins, roland casper, and robert de la

Well the standard rule applies here:
Don't say it on the net if you wouldn't be comfortable seeing it on the

You tried zoloft for your alergies?  geez i bet that helped...  are you
sure you don't mean zyrtec?  now that i think about it i remember zyrtec
looked a lot like zoloft...  and what is this bad press that Seldane is
getting?  I haven't heard anything about it...

in fact, i think i remember something about seldane getting pulled from the
market.  the chemical in it (terfendaine if i remember correctly) had too
many drug interactions so they made a similar chemical to it that didn't
have as many side effects...

I was wondering if anyone has, and if so knows where to get, Mockmoon by
Genlog.  Future Sounds has already been checked.

Also Cafe del Mar by Energy52.

Is it just me or is this guy very opinionated?  Maybe there are some people
who do like Skylab 2000 and Tommy Sunshine and DOn't like the other's(myself
not included)  But that doesn't mean there is something wrong with them.  I
persannly don't like tommy sunshine or skylab 2000, but i can't stand Robert
De La Gauthier.  And I know there is not something wrong with me.  I
understand you might have opinions, but express them as such.  Don't put

ok..  i'm not quite as up on electronica sub-categories as i'd like to
be...  is there somewhere i can go for a definitive definition (is that
redundant?  probably) of gabber, dark, and techstep?  these are just
some classifications that i've heard, but really don't know what they
are... i'm sure i've heard music of these styles, but just never
classified them as such..

As far as I gathered, the point of the post had little to do with the fact
that these two crews were not showing up, but rather that this party was being
thrown by irresponsible promoters. I believe the poster was looking for the
names of the people pulling "this same old bullshit"...that being advertizing
a Dj when they never intend for them to show up (or make it extremely
difficult for them to). Needless to say, that is shady practice. Personally, I
don't *want* to attend a party thrown by someone who would do something like
that, whether they are advertizing Joe Shmoe the local disco-Dj or Rabbit in
the Moon. If you're not intending to HAVE someone spin at your party, don't
use their names to pull in a crowd. I don't know about the rest of you, but I
don't want to support promoters like that.

the thing is, society doesn't have any rights, however i do.  the only
reason society seems to have rights is that all it's members do..  all
i'm saying is that prostitution, gambling, drugs, and other victimless
crimes have no victim (by definition), so why are they illegal?  because
big brother thinks they are bad and i shouldn't do them 'cause the
christian majority is against it?  that's a pretty lame reason...  i
have the right to do whatever i want to myself, and every time it
becomes apparent that i don't, i get really ticked off..

there is a clear line in my opinion..  if the 'crime' hurts no one other
than the person commiting the 'crime', then it should be legal..  they
shouldn't be able to stop me from hurting myself, it's my decision..

gotta love monica...

i never saw that..  i would have liked to watch it.. i love watching
people say obviously false things on TV to change the opinions of the
bumbling masses...  it sucks, though, 'cause it usually works...   it's
unfortunate that the vast majority of americans are willing to take
whatever they see on TV as the word of God..

No they can't.  I mean, turn on the television.  "Rock stars" do it
all the time.  So do people on shitty talk shows.  

But, on the other hand what you do have to worry about is saying
something like, "I bought a sheet of @cid" or other things that would
imply that you still have the drug$.  Because then the cops or whoever
do have an excuse to arrest you . . . or at least tear your house
apart trying to find the illicit substances.  

I don't know if it was this list, but somebody had the idea to put a _
in the middle of shady words (mari_juana) in order to fool search
engines.

>i'm saying is that prostitution, gambling, drugs, and other >victimless 
crimes have no victim (by definition), so why are they >illegal?  
actually, these do have effects on society. some drug usage can cause 
people to lose their livelyhood/get messed up/etc. and then the govt. 
has to pay for their unemployment, medical treatment, etc.  that the 
government has to pay for. in the end, we are paying for this with our 
tax dollars.

>because
>big brother thinks they are bad and i shouldn't do them 'cause the
>christian majority is against it?  that's a pretty lame reason...
gambling is definately under this area, as is our wack drinking age of 
21. (like, I was abroad for 2 years, went to bars all the time and then 
couldn't drink when I came back. whatever.)
Prostitution is another one- if it were legal + regulated, it would not 
only help with safety against diseases but would also make it more safe 
for the women doing it.

>i have the right to do whatever i want to myself, and every time it
>becomes apparent that i don't, i get really ticked off..
I don't know that it's such a good idea for the govt. to legalize 
everything. remember that people are discouraged from doing things that 
are illegal by the risk of getting caught, thus pushing the majority of 
people not to do illegal drugs. just look at say, alcohol use among 
college students- if normal peeps had the same access (and lack of 
illegality) to acid, for example, I can see some seriously bad 
situations arising. 

>there is a clear line in my opinion..  if the 'crime' hurts no one 
>other than the person commiting the 'crime', then it should be >legal..  
they shouldn't be able to stop me from hurting myself, it's >my 
decision..
you make decisions based on their advantages and disadvantages, but 
people are not always that informed about their decisions. I do think 
that many laws need revamping/loosening, but I really do see some things 
as controlled substances- heroin, cocaine, meth... these are highly 
addictive (ok, so are cigarettes, but I'll leave them out) and for that 
reason I don't think it's a good idea to have widespread access to them.
Also, drugs *do* hurt other people, legal or not. Hello? drunk (or 
otherwise) driving? now maybe you are a responsible user, but not 
everyone else is.

sure there major changes necessary in our government, but one should try 
to see if the benefits of loosening control outweigh the disadvantages.

I think maybe you were misinterpreting my point here.  I have seen tommy
sunshine, and i have heard a fair deal of skylab 2000's music, and i think
they are good performers.  It's not my cup of tea, but they are talented
nonetheless.  I was not taking a shot at whoever liked ONLY these 2 people
that would be at this event, I was just stating that the absence of these 2
people at this event won't have a drastic effect on the quality of the event. 

lou

btw, i know the promoter personally, and i think that jason is one of the
"least shady" promoters in detroit.

i dunno it seems to me like there is definately a lack of interest in scj....
(i try not to miss one but i missed last weeks cause i waz sick.....how was
it? and im gonna hafta miss deisel boy cause ill be out of town...damn!) it
seems like theres always the same few headz there all the time.... but the
line up is always phat and the vibe is always great.  i just wanted to give
mad props to the whole krew thats responsible for scj...i know how hard it is
to keep tryin your hardest and puttin all of yer heart into something when it
seems like no one really cares.....keep it up though im sure things will get
better.  i have a great time every single time i go....so im sure if you can
just get people to walk in the door theyll be hooked....ive gone on long
enough....but keep up the good work...it would be a real shame to lose
something as great as steel city jungle.

ok
we actually believed that the worst thing that happened at IGC was the crazy shoving man in the
main room.
it's come to our attention however, that someone collected $150 or so from various individuals
for an after-hours to be held at a local park.
i informed the individual that i had spoken with representatives from the local parks and that
an after-hours was NOT possible.
one promoter from Buffalo put $30 in as a donation.
i will be paying her back for this.
there was no after-hours and the money certainly wasn't returned to me as it should have been.
it's rumored that the individual spent the money on new records as he is a DJ
