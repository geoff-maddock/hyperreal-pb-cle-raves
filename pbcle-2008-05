             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Ewun
(Lifted Music, Human Imprint, Evol Intent) - Rochester, NY

Ewun tha Gun delivers tracks that sound like a robot with Turrets 
syndrome on a very serious mission.ù A hint of early 90s ragga-styled 
breakbeat hardcore percolates deep underneath the crust of industrial 
twisted metal mayhem and hardcore hip-hops sibilant cadence. Ewun's 
transatlantic influences have appropriately led to partnerships with 
UK-based labels Barcode Recordings and Lifted Music UK, as well as 
Dieselboy's Human Imprint. The upcoming year promises to reveal several 
tracks of grimey jungalist haze and aggressively smelt percussion. His 
latest tour entitled the Levitation tour is smashing across the U.S. 
sponsored by Lifted Music.

Nino Anthony,(portamento)-Columbus,OH

Nino Anthony, dj/producer and co-label owner of Portamento Records has 
always had a love and passion for music of all genres. He first made a 
name for himself in 2006 as a producer by releasing tracks on his newly 
formed label at the time, Portamento Records. His first single .Dance 
All Night. was remixed by Italy.s respected producer, Alex Kenji and was 
charted by several dj.s including Donald Glaude. Shortly after, his 
remix of David Farlow.s .How I Roll. was charted and supported by Sucker 
Dj.s. Since then Nino has released a whole slew of releases and remixes 
on some of the biggest labels in the world in including Subliminal, 
Juicy Traxx, Pacha Recordings, Eden Recordings, Play Digital, Movement 
Music, Curvve, BugEyed Records, New Era, Cubic, Wagram & Vendetta among 
many others.

Sun May 25                      LEE BURRIDGE                     Pittsburgh

Humanaut proudly presents:
LEE BURRIDGE

Privilege - Sunday, Memorial Day Weekend, May 25th, 2008

It's 1985 in the idyllic backwaters of rural England and a young Lee 
Burridge has just embarked on what will become a very colourful DJ 
career. Currently, though, he's playing appalling music at birthdays, 
weddings, and the odd funeral. Sadly for the deceased, but luckily for 
us, with aspirations of playing the kind of music he's been hearing at 
acid house parties, Lee takes a quick look at his life and decides a 
change is needed. So he moves from Dorset. to Hong Kong. As you do. The 
calibre of Lee's early parties ensured that scores of world-class DJs 
played, and these sometimes chaotic, often unforgettable nights helped 
lay the foundation for Hong Kong's now thriving underground house scene.

It wasn.t all fun though. During his 6 years at the forefront off Asia's 
dance music scene, Lee and his cohorts also endured gruelling periods 
hanging about on the beaches of Thailand, as they brought dance music to 
the legendary full moon parties for the first time.2 DJs who passed 
through Hong Kong were Sasha and Craig Richards, and these guys later 
fashioned together a partnership called Tyrant. In 1998, they lured Lee 
back to the UK, using carrots, to become part of the Tyrant Soundsystem.

As Tyrant, Lee and Craig have now released 2 compilations and, luckily 
for them, each has been respected and loved by DJs and clubbers alike. 
Listening carefully, you.ll hear tracks with a progressive edge, techy 
grooves, deep house and some breaks thrown in for good measure. The 
colossal Pete Tong named the first release his 'album of the year.' 
Urban legend has it that, on hearing the news, Lee got drunk on shandy 
to celebrate. Like the albums, Lee's sound is versatile and unique. He's 
comfortable playing warm-up and peaktime slots, or both if the vibe's 
right. Not satisfied with holding down residencies at Fabric in London 
and The Bomb in Nottingham, his travels take him across the globe from 
Romania to Argentina, Asia to America.In 2002, Lee Burridge was voted 
No.10 in the DJ Magazine Top 100 poll. although Lee's still struggling 
to think of 9 DJs who are actually better than him.

So there you have it. a summary of 18 years worth of music and DJing. 
But just forget everything else and remember this: Lee Burridge likes to 
party with the best of us, reads a crowd like no other, and plays some 
of the most mind-boggling, genre bending and jaw-dropping records you.re 
ever likely to hear. Period

Sat May 31                          SNUFF                        Cincinatti

Burufunk

With over 40 commercial releases on more than 30 labels, his success can 
be measured by his achievements. Burufunk.s debut single, .Freedom,. 
released by Kloud 9 Music and featured on the 1998 Streetbeat 
compilation, Battle on Funky Planet, made the track a hit and propelled 
the artist onto the international stage. As a respected producer and 
pioneer of the breakbeat era, Burufunk kept the ball rolling with 
several other hit singles, including the 2000 release of, .The Dream 
Experience,. on Napzzz and his now infamous, .Outsider,. which was 
featured by Nick Warren on the 2003 Global Underground compilation, 
#024: Reykjavik. After some well deserved international notoriety, many 
more opportunities presented themselves, including one that led to the 
hit Burufunk remix of BT.s, .Simply Being Loved (Somnambulist).. 
Renowned artist and producer, BT .was absolutely knocked sideways!., by 
the brilliantly crafted Burufunk remix, as was the entire dance music 
industry. Knowing it was important to work with other artists and 
performers, Burufunk forged a lifelong relationship with artists like 
Deepsky, DJ Icey, and many more.

Over time, Burufunk managed to perfect his art and build a live 
performance as energetic and creative as the sounds he brings with him. 
>From his .on the fly. sound manipulation, to his custom crafted remixes, 
Burufunk seamlessly crafts his exclusive sets right from the minds of 
his audience. Burufunk has opened for some of the biggest names in the 
industry on the most extravagant stages in the world, including the 
Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference in Miami. It was his 
2006 performance with Carbon Community in Miami, that kicked off their 
Community Funk Tour, and brought his future intentions front and center.

After several years of effective work in the industry, Burufunk teamed 
up with long-time friend and colleague, Brett Holland to help build the 
new Orlando-based indie label Shiznit Recordings, home of the hottest 
cutting edge EDM. Watch for upcoming shows and releases from Burufunk in 
2007, including the monster progressive house single .Serenity,. 
featuring vocals by 3PM, slated for a spring 2007 release on Undermine 
Records.

DJ Lea Luna

At the young age of 24, ear and eye-catching DJ Lea Luna has quite a 
handle on the club scene. She is a lifelong musician: playing keys for 
as far back as she can remember, and spinning records since she wasn't 
even of age to get into the clubs (in the underground rave heydey, 
1999). When a 16 year old girl begins sharpening mixing skills and 
stacking up an arsenal of records and CDs that soon in her life, what 
potential does she already have in the club industry when she turns 21? 
DJ Lea Luna will tell you. She's already played all over the country at 
some of the most prestigious clubs and events the commercial electronic 
scene has. Her remix sets and her 6-foot-blonde stage prowess handed her 
the rockstar nickname "bootlegs." Her crowd-shaking mix of big-room 
club, house, progressive, rock, and retro landed her in the DJ booths of 
clubs such as Avalon New York and B.E.D. Miami. Not only clubs took 
notice. She even rocked the stage with Ultra music fest favorite Kevens, 
as part of his show, and opened for music legends Steven Tyler and Chuck 
Berry. "After these past couple of years, I feel like I've reached a 
level in my artistry that measures up with the best, and I'm ready to 
own it. I recently added my first name to my former DJ name, DJ Luna. To 
me, the name Lea Luna symbolizes the final touch. I've completely 
embodied the artist I've always dreamed of being. I've become the real 
ME." ...and that she has.

Describing Lea's upcoming new release - LUNANIMOUS is one voice, one 
massive. The massive is speaking one
universal language; at every rock show, night club, house party,
through every radio station, in every ipod. Lea Luna's LUNANIMOUS is
a new dialect of the rock-tronica tongue that both the underground
and overground massives can fluently express.

"I started early, I traveled, I learned, I met people... I went through 
all kinds of music training, audio school, and this whole DJ thing 
forever. Now, I've pinpointed my love for this scene, the music, the 
lyric, my life in general, and art in general. I've defined my 
strengths, my own unique style, my inspiration, and my goals to a T. It 
all leads up to this: basically, I've lived my whole life to make this 
new music ROCK and take it to the stage."

DJ B N@$TY

B N@$TY has been making a name for himself all across the country this 
past year. After opening for Lea Luna in Reno, NV in December, they 
decided to team up again for Snuff. With his mind on the scene and the 
scene on his music, B N@$TY is laying down that Speed Garage Sound in a 
city near you. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Dave Digital vs Straight Vizual

Thats right kids, your two favorite Drum-N-Breaks DJ's are going to be

or just sick ass tracks, Dave Digital and Josh Vizual are 2 of the 
Tri-State's favorite tag sets. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} Lot's of new(er) Tunes... Selekta Recordings

I guess I should have mentioned this before, but I've been swamped  
with so many different things...
anyway, about a year ago, Dennis (who some of you know .. used to be  
in Sacramento, now in Philly) started looking for tracks to put out.
We had talked about doing this for the last 10 years or so, but didn't  
get around to it. haha.
Anyway, just like selekta.com was about going after new, interesting  
and "real" stuff back in the day, Selekta Recordings is doing the same  
now with toons. We are doing all digital releases, and music is for  
sale on most of the MP3 sites. We also figured we'd just sell direct  
so we could put out more stuff quicker.

http://selektarecordings.com

It's mostly house, but the EPs have some good techno, tech house,  
breaks and downtempo stuff as well.
We just did EP number 17.


Enjoy.

Also... if any of you have music you'd like to get out there, drop me  
an email. Always looking for stuff.
Nobody's getting rich on this.... but it's a way to reach a bigger  
audience with your tracks.

peace my party people.

dave

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sun May 25                      LEE BURRIDGE                     Pittsburgh

Humanaut proudly presents:
LEE BURRIDGE

Privilege - Sunday, Memorial Day Weekend, May 25th, 2008

It's 1985 in the idyllic backwaters of rural England and a young Lee 
Burridge has just embarked on what will become a very colourful DJ 
career. Currently, though, he's playing appalling music at birthdays, 
weddings, and the odd funeral. Sadly for the deceased, but luckily for 
us, with aspirations of playing the kind of music he's been hearing at 
acid house parties, Lee takes a quick look at his life and decides a 
change is needed. So he moves from Dorset. to Hong Kong. As you do. The 
calibre of Lee's early parties ensured that scores of world-class DJs 
played, and these sometimes chaotic, often unforgettable nights helped 
lay the foundation for Hong Kong's now thriving underground house scene.

It wasn.t all fun though. During his 6 years at the forefront off Asia's 
dance music scene, Lee and his cohorts also endured gruelling periods 
hanging about on the beaches of Thailand, as they brought dance music to 
the legendary full moon parties for the first time.2 DJs who passed 
through Hong Kong were Sasha and Craig Richards, and these guys later 
fashioned together a partnership called Tyrant. In 1998, they lured Lee 
back to the UK, using carrots, to become part of the Tyrant Soundsystem.

As Tyrant, Lee and Craig have now released 2 compilations and, luckily 
for them, each has been respected and loved by DJs and clubbers alike. 
Listening carefully, you.ll hear tracks with a progressive edge, techy 
grooves, deep house and some breaks thrown in for good measure. The 
colossal Pete Tong named the first release his 'album of the year.' 
Urban legend has it that, on hearing the news, Lee got drunk on shandy 
to celebrate. Like the albums, Lee's sound is versatile and unique. He's 
comfortable playing warm-up and peaktime slots, or both if the vibe's 
right. Not satisfied with holding down residencies at Fabric in London 
and The Bomb in Nottingham, his travels take him across the globe from 
Romania to Argentina, Asia to America.In 2002, Lee Burridge was voted 
No.10 in the DJ Magazine Top 100 poll. although Lee's still struggling 
to think of 9 DJs who are actually better than him.

So there you have it. a summary of 18 years worth of music and DJing. 
But just forget everything else and remember this: Lee Burridge likes to 
party with the best of us, reads a crowd like no other, and plays some 
of the most mind-boggling, genre bending and jaw-dropping records you.re 
ever likely to hear. Period

Sat May 31                          SNUFF                        Cincinatti

Burufunk

With over 40 commercial releases on more than 30 labels, his success can 
be measured by his achievements. Burufunk.s debut single, .Freedom,. 
released by Kloud 9 Music and featured on the 1998 Streetbeat 
compilation, Battle on Funky Planet, made the track a hit and propelled 
the artist onto the international stage. As a respected producer and 
pioneer of the breakbeat era, Burufunk kept the ball rolling with 
several other hit singles, including the 2000 release of, .The Dream 
Experience,. on Napzzz and his now infamous, .Outsider,. which was 
featured by Nick Warren on the 2003 Global Underground compilation, 
#024: Reykjavik. After some well deserved international notoriety, many 
more opportunities presented themselves, including one that led to the 
hit Burufunk remix of BT.s, .Simply Being Loved (Somnambulist).. 
Renowned artist and producer, BT .was absolutely knocked sideways!., by 
the brilliantly crafted Burufunk remix, as was the entire dance music 
industry. Knowing it was important to work with other artists and 
performers, Burufunk forged a lifelong relationship with artists like 
Deepsky, DJ Icey, and many more.

Over time, Burufunk managed to perfect his art and build a live 
performance as energetic and creative as the sounds he brings with him. 
>From his .on the fly. sound manipulation, to his custom crafted remixes, 
Burufunk seamlessly crafts his exclusive sets right from the minds of 
his audience. Burufunk has opened for some of the biggest names in the 
industry on the most extravagant stages in the world, including the 
Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference in Miami. It was his 
2006 performance with Carbon Community in Miami, that kicked off their 
Community Funk Tour, and brought his future intentions front and center.

After several years of effective work in the industry, Burufunk teamed 
up with long-time friend and colleague, Brett Holland to help build the 
new Orlando-based indie label Shiznit Recordings, home of the hottest 
cutting edge EDM. Watch for upcoming shows and releases from Burufunk in 
2007, including the monster progressive house single .Serenity,. 
featuring vocals by 3PM, slated for a spring 2007 release on Undermine 
Records.

DJ Lea Luna

At the young age of 24, ear and eye-catching DJ Lea Luna has quite a 
handle on the club scene. She is a lifelong musician: playing keys for 
as far back as she can remember, and spinning records since she wasn't 
even of age to get into the clubs (in the underground rave heydey, 
1999). When a 16 year old girl begins sharpening mixing skills and 
stacking up an arsenal of records and CDs that soon in her life, what 
potential does she already have in the club industry when she turns 21? 
DJ Lea Luna will tell you. She's already played all over the country at 
some of the most prestigious clubs and events the commercial electronic 
scene has. Her remix sets and her 6-foot-blonde stage prowess handed her 
the rockstar nickname "bootlegs." Her crowd-shaking mix of big-room 
club, house, progressive, rock, and retro landed her in the DJ booths of 
clubs such as Avalon New York and B.E.D. Miami. Not only clubs took 
notice. She even rocked the stage with Ultra music fest favorite Kevens, 
as part of his show, and opened for music legends Steven Tyler and Chuck 
Berry. "After these past couple of years, I feel like I've reached a 
level in my artistry that measures up with the best, and I'm ready to 
own it. I recently added my first name to my former DJ name, DJ Luna. To 
me, the name Lea Luna symbolizes the final touch. I've completely 
embodied the artist I've always dreamed of being. I've become the real 
ME." ...and that she has.

Describing Lea's upcoming new release - LUNANIMOUS is one voice, one 
massive. The massive is speaking one
universal language; at every rock show, night club, house party,
through every radio station, in every ipod. Lea Luna's LUNANIMOUS is
a new dialect of the rock-tronica tongue that both the underground
and overground massives can fluently express.

"I started early, I traveled, I learned, I met people... I went through 
all kinds of music training, audio school, and this whole DJ thing 
forever. Now, I've pinpointed my love for this scene, the music, the 
lyric, my life in general, and art in general. I've defined my 
strengths, my own unique style, my inspiration, and my goals to a T. It 
all leads up to this: basically, I've lived my whole life to make this 
new music ROCK and take it to the stage."

DJ B N@$TY

B N@$TY has been making a name for himself all across the country this 
past year. After opening for Lea Luna in Reno, NV in December, they 
decided to team up again for Snuff. With his mind on the scene and the 
scene on his music, B N@$TY is laying down that Speed Garage Sound in a 
city near you. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Dave Digital vs Straight Vizual

Thats right kids, your two favorite Drum-N-Breaks DJ's are going to be

or just sick ass tracks, Dave Digital and Josh Vizual are 2 of the

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Subject: {pb-cle} [PIT] LEE BURRIDGE @ Privilege - Sun - 5.25.08 

LEE BURRIDGE @ Privilege - Sunday, Memorial Day Weekend, May 25th, 2008

It's 1985 in the idyllic backwaters of rural England and a young Lee
Burridge has just embarked on what will become a very colourful DJ career.
Currently, though, he's playing appalling music at birthdays, weddings,
and the odd funeral. Sadly for the deceased, but luckily for us, with
aspirations of playing the kind of music he's been hearing at acid house
parties, Lee takes a quick look at his life and decides a change is
needed. So he moves from Dorset... to Hong Kong. As you do. The calibre of
Lee's early parties ensured that scores of world-class DJs played, and
these sometimes chaotic, often unforgettable nights helped lay the
foundation for Hong Kong's now thriving underground house scene.

It wasn't all fun though. During his 6 years at the forefront off Asia's
dance music scene, Lee and his cohorts also endured gruelling periods
hanging about on the beaches of Thailand, as they brought dance music to
the legendary full moon parties for the first time.2 DJs who passed
through Hong Kong were Sasha and Craig Richards, and these guys later
fashioned together a partnership called Tyrant. In 1998, they lured Lee
back to the UK, using carrots, to become part of the Tyrant Soundsystem.

As Tyrant, Lee and Craig have now released 2 compilations and, luckily for
them, each has been respected and loved by DJs and clubbers alike.
Listening carefully, you'll hear tracks with a progressive edge, techy
grooves, deep house and some breaks thrown in for good measure. The
colossal Pete Tong named the first release his 'album of the year'. Urban
legend has it that, on hearing the news, Lee got drunk on shandy to
celebrate. Like the albums, Lee's sound is versatile and unique. He's
comfortable playing warm-up and peaktime slots, or both if the vibe's
right. Not satisfied with holding down residencies at Fabric in London and
The Bomb in Nottingham, his travels take him across the globe from Romania
to Argentina, Asia to America.In 2002, Lee Burridge was voted No.10 in the
DJ Magazine Top 100 poll... although Lee's still struggling to think of 9
DJs who are actually better than him.

So there you have it... a summary of 18 years worth of music and DJing.
But just forget everything else and remember this: Lee Burridge likes to
party with the best of us, reads a crowd like no other, and plays some of
the most mind-boggling, genre bending and jaw-dropping records you're ever
likely to hear. Period

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sun May 25                      LEE BURRIDGE                     Pittsburgh

Humanaut proudly presents:
LEE BURRIDGE

Privilege - Sunday, Memorial Day Weekend, May 25th, 2008

It's 1985 in the idyllic backwaters of rural England and a young Lee 
Burridge has just embarked on what will become a very colourful DJ 
career. Currently, though, he's playing appalling music at birthdays, 
weddings, and the odd funeral. Sadly for the deceased, but luckily for 
us, with aspirations of playing the kind of music he's been hearing at 
acid house parties, Lee takes a quick look at his life and decides a 
change is needed. So he moves from Dorset. to Hong Kong. As you do. The 
calibre of Lee's early parties ensured that scores of world-class DJs 
played, and these sometimes chaotic, often unforgettable nights helped 
lay the foundation for Hong Kong's now thriving underground house scene.

It wasn.t all fun though. During his 6 years at the forefront off Asia's 
dance music scene, Lee and his cohorts also endured gruelling periods 
hanging about on the beaches of Thailand, as they brought dance music to 
the legendary full moon parties for the first time.2 DJs who passed 
through Hong Kong were Sasha and Craig Richards, and these guys later 
fashioned together a partnership called Tyrant. In 1998, they lured Lee 
back to the UK, using carrots, to become part of the Tyrant Soundsystem.

As Tyrant, Lee and Craig have now released 2 compilations and, luckily 
for them, each has been respected and loved by DJs and clubbers alike. 
Listening carefully, you.ll hear tracks with a progressive edge, techy 
grooves, deep house and some breaks thrown in for good measure. The 
colossal Pete Tong named the first release his 'album of the year.' 
Urban legend has it that, on hearing the news, Lee got drunk on shandy 
to celebrate. Like the albums, Lee's sound is versatile and unique. He's 
comfortable playing warm-up and peaktime slots, or both if the vibe's 
right. Not satisfied with holding down residencies at Fabric in London 
and The Bomb in Nottingham, his travels take him across the globe from 
Romania to Argentina, Asia to America.In 2002, Lee Burridge was voted 
No.10 in the DJ Magazine Top 100 poll. although Lee's still struggling 
to think of 9 DJs who are actually better than him.

So there you have it. a summary of 18 years worth of music and DJing. 
But just forget everything else and remember this: Lee Burridge likes to 
party with the best of us, reads a crowd like no other, and plays some 
of the most mind-boggling, genre bending and jaw-dropping records you.re 
ever likely to hear. Period

Sat May 31                          SNUFF                        Cincinatti

Burufunk

With over 40 commercial releases on more than 30 labels, his success can 
be measured by his achievements. Burufunk.s debut single, .Freedom,. 
released by Kloud 9 Music and featured on the 1998 Streetbeat 
compilation, Battle on Funky Planet, made the track a hit and propelled 
the artist onto the international stage. As a respected producer and 
pioneer of the breakbeat era, Burufunk kept the ball rolling with 
several other hit singles, including the 2000 release of, .The Dream 
Experience,. on Napzzz and his now infamous, .Outsider,. which was 
featured by Nick Warren on the 2003 Global Underground compilation, 
#024: Reykjavik. After some well deserved international notoriety, many 
more opportunities presented themselves, including one that led to the 
hit Burufunk remix of BT.s, .Simply Being Loved (Somnambulist).. 
Renowned artist and producer, BT .was absolutely knocked sideways!., by 
the brilliantly crafted Burufunk remix, as was the entire dance music 
industry. Knowing it was important to work with other artists and 
performers, Burufunk forged a lifelong relationship with artists like 
Deepsky, DJ Icey, and many more.

Over time, Burufunk managed to perfect his art and build a live 
performance as energetic and creative as the sounds he brings with him. 
>From his .on the fly. sound manipulation, to his custom crafted remixes, 
Burufunk seamlessly crafts his exclusive sets right from the minds of 
his audience. Burufunk has opened for some of the biggest names in the 
industry on the most extravagant stages in the world, including the 
Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference in Miami. It was his 
2006 performance with Carbon Community in Miami, that kicked off their 
Community Funk Tour, and brought his future intentions front and center.

After several years of effective work in the industry, Burufunk teamed 
up with long-time friend and colleague, Brett Holland to help build the 
new Orlando-based indie label Shiznit Recordings, home of the hottest 
cutting edge EDM. Watch for upcoming shows and releases from Burufunk in 
2007, including the monster progressive house single .Serenity,. 
featuring vocals by 3PM, slated for a spring 2007 release on Undermine 
Records.

DJ Lea Luna

At the young age of 24, ear and eye-catching DJ Lea Luna has quite a 
handle on the club scene. She is a lifelong musician: playing keys for 
as far back as she can remember, and spinning records since she wasn't 
even of age to get into the clubs (in the underground rave heydey, 
1999). When a 16 year old girl begins sharpening mixing skills and 
stacking up an arsenal of records and CDs that soon in her life, what 
potential does she already have in the club industry when she turns 21? 
DJ Lea Luna will tell you. She's already played all over the country at 
some of the most prestigious clubs and events the commercial electronic 
scene has. Her remix sets and her 6-foot-blonde stage prowess handed her 
the rockstar nickname "bootlegs." Her crowd-shaking mix of big-room 
club, house, progressive, rock, and retro landed her in the DJ booths of 
clubs such as Avalon New York and B.E.D. Miami. Not only clubs took 
notice. She even rocked the stage with Ultra music fest favorite Kevens, 
as part of his show, and opened for music legends Steven Tyler and Chuck 
Berry. "After these past couple of years, I feel like I've reached a 
level in my artistry that measures up with the best, and I'm ready to 
own it. I recently added my first name to my former DJ name, DJ Luna. To 
me, the name Lea Luna symbolizes the final touch. I've completely 
embodied the artist I've always dreamed of being. I've become the real 
ME." ...and that she has.

Describing Lea's upcoming new release - LUNANIMOUS is one voice, one 
massive. The massive is speaking one
universal language; at every rock show, night club, house party,
through every radio station, in every ipod. Lea Luna's LUNANIMOUS is
a new dialect of the rock-tronica tongue that both the underground
and overground massives can fluently express.

"I started early, I traveled, I learned, I met people... I went through 
all kinds of music training, audio school, and this whole DJ thing 
forever. Now, I've pinpointed my love for this scene, the music, the 
lyric, my life in general, and art in general. I've defined my 
strengths, my own unique style, my inspiration, and my goals to a T. It 
all leads up to this: basically, I've lived my whole life to make this 
new music ROCK and take it to the stage."

DJ B N@$TY

B N@$TY has been making a name for himself all across the country this 
past year. After opening for Lea Luna in Reno, NV in December, they 
decided to team up again for Snuff. With his mind on the scene and the 
scene on his music, B N@$TY is laying down that Speed Garage Sound in a 
city near you. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Dave Digital vs Straight Vizual

Thats right kids, your two favorite Drum-N-Breaks DJ's are going to be

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Great music at a great downtown Detroit brewery!

$15 cover / 18+ / 10pm-5am
Atwater Block Brewery
237 Joseph Campau St.
Detroit 48207

LA Riots with special guests: DJ Zebo (2008 Urb Next 100 Artist), DJ 
Howlermonkey, Jessica Partin, John K, and DJ Uzi.

An after party for the 2008 Detroit Electronic Music Festival

2 miles from Hart Plaza . Head northeast on E. Jefferson Ave. turn right 
onto Joseph Campau Street!

LA Riots (Los Angeles)
www.myspace.com/lariotsofficial
LA Riots exploded on the national scene in 2007 with a killer 
unauthorized remix of Justice and then offered up edit after stuttering 
vocal edit of the likes of Chromeo, Photek, The Cure, Kid Sister, The 
Scanners, Mystery Jets, and Hot Chip. After years of DJ.ing the top 
clubs in Hollywood, LA Riots are now taking over dance floors across the 
nation.

Reigning electro kings MSTRKRFT say that .LA Riots are the best in L.A. 
Whenever we play with them, we know we really have to bring our best. 
and not many DJs make us nervous!.

DJ Zebo (Chicago)
www.djzebo.com
Urb Magazine boasts that this 2008 Next 100 artist sounds like a 
.renegade junglist from the future infiltrating a .99 South-Side Chicago 
juke party.. In other words . DJ Zebo throws down the schizophrenic 
dance and hip hop genre bending style known as Baltimore Club. With four 
Chicago residencies you know this guy can deliver the goods.

DJ Howlermonkey (Pittsburgh)
www.myspace.com/howlermonkeyband
DJ Howlermonkey plays diverse sets that fuse modern and retro styles of 
electrofunk, electrohouse, R&B, and disco all with a common driving and 
highly energetic motif: a marriage of cocaine 80's Miami and early 90's 
rave. His mixes have taken the net by storm, being featured on blogs 
including: Pitchforkmedia, Discobelle, Fluokids, and New York Magazine.

Jessica Partin (Houston)
Manifesto . www.jessicapartin.com
A key figure in Houston's underground dance scene, Jessica Partin is 
known for her bold mixing style and sophisticated sets that layer 
minimal techno and tech house with a female sense of aesthetics.

Also Featuring:

John K (Houston/Cleveland) . tech house and minimal techno
DJ Uzi (Cleveland) . relentless dark psytrance

Sun May 25                      LEE BURRIDGE                     Pittsburgh

Humanaut proudly presents:
LEE BURRIDGE

Privilege - Sunday, Memorial Day Weekend, May 25th, 2008

It's 1985 in the idyllic backwaters of rural England and a young Lee 
Burridge has just embarked on what will become a very colourful DJ 
career. Currently, though, he's playing appalling music at birthdays, 
weddings, and the odd funeral. Sadly for the deceased, but luckily for 
us, with aspirations of playing the kind of music he's been hearing at 
acid house parties, Lee takes a quick look at his life and decides a 
change is needed. So he moves from Dorset. to Hong Kong. As you do. The 
calibre of Lee's early parties ensured that scores of world-class DJs 
played, and these sometimes chaotic, often unforgettable nights helped 
lay the foundation for Hong Kong's now thriving underground house scene.

It wasn.t all fun though. During his 6 years at the forefront off Asia's 
dance music scene, Lee and his cohorts also endured gruelling periods 
hanging about on the beaches of Thailand, as they brought dance music to 
the legendary full moon parties for the first time.2 DJs who passed 
through Hong Kong were Sasha and Craig Richards, and these guys later 
fashioned together a partnership called Tyrant. In 1998, they lured Lee 
back to the UK, using carrots, to become part of the Tyrant Soundsystem.

As Tyrant, Lee and Craig have now released 2 compilations and, luckily 
for them, each has been respected and loved by DJs and clubbers alike. 
Listening carefully, you.ll hear tracks with a progressive edge, techy 
grooves, deep house and some breaks thrown in for good measure. The 
colossal Pete Tong named the first release his 'album of the year.' 
Urban legend has it that, on hearing the news, Lee got drunk on shandy 
to celebrate. Like the albums, Lee's sound is versatile and unique. He's 
comfortable playing warm-up and peaktime slots, or both if the vibe's 
right. Not satisfied with holding down residencies at Fabric in London 
and The Bomb in Nottingham, his travels take him across the globe from 
Romania to Argentina, Asia to America.In 2002, Lee Burridge was voted 
No.10 in the DJ Magazine Top 100 poll. although Lee's still struggling 
to think of 9 DJs who are actually better than him.

So there you have it. a summary of 18 years worth of music and DJing. 
But just forget everything else and remember this: Lee Burridge likes to 
party with the best of us, reads a crowd like no other, and plays some 
of the most mind-boggling, genre bending and jaw-dropping records you.re 
ever likely to hear. Period

Sat May 31                          SNUFF                        Cincinatti

Burufunk

With over 40 commercial releases on more than 30 labels, his success can 
be measured by his achievements. Burufunk.s debut single, .Freedom,. 
released by Kloud 9 Music and featured on the 1998 Streetbeat 
compilation, Battle on Funky Planet, made the track a hit and propelled 
the artist onto the international stage. As a respected producer and 
pioneer of the breakbeat era, Burufunk kept the ball rolling with 
several other hit singles, including the 2000 release of, .The Dream 
Experience,. on Napzzz and his now infamous, .Outsider,. which was 
featured by Nick Warren on the 2003 Global Underground compilation, 
#024: Reykjavik. After some well deserved international notoriety, many 
more opportunities presented themselves, including one that led to the 
hit Burufunk remix of BT.s, .Simply Being Loved (Somnambulist).. 
Renowned artist and producer, BT .was absolutely knocked sideways!., by 
the brilliantly crafted Burufunk remix, as was the entire dance music 
industry. Knowing it was important to work with other artists and 
performers, Burufunk forged a lifelong relationship with artists like 
Deepsky, DJ Icey, and many more.

Over time, Burufunk managed to perfect his art and build a live 
performance as energetic and creative as the sounds he brings with him. 
>From his .on the fly. sound manipulation, to his custom crafted remixes, 
Burufunk seamlessly crafts his exclusive sets right from the minds of 
his audience. Burufunk has opened for some of the biggest names in the 
industry on the most extravagant stages in the world, including the 
Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference in Miami. It was his 
2006 performance with Carbon Community in Miami, that kicked off their 
Community Funk Tour, and brought his future intentions front and center.

After several years of effective work in the industry, Burufunk teamed 
up with long-time friend and colleague, Brett Holland to help build the 
new Orlando-based indie label Shiznit Recordings, home of the hottest 
cutting edge EDM. Watch for upcoming shows and releases from Burufunk in 
2007, including the monster progressive house single .Serenity,. 
featuring vocals by 3PM, slated for a spring 2007 release on Undermine 
Records.

DJ Lea Luna

At the young age of 24, ear and eye-catching DJ Lea Luna has quite a 
handle on the club scene. She is a lifelong musician: playing keys for 
as far back as she can remember, and spinning records since she wasn't 
even of age to get into the clubs (in the underground rave heydey, 
1999). When a 16 year old girl begins sharpening mixing skills and 
stacking up an arsenal of records and CDs that soon in her life, what 
potential does she already have in the club industry when she turns 21? 
DJ Lea Luna will tell you. She's already played all over the country at 
some of the most prestigious clubs and events the commercial electronic 
scene has. Her remix sets and her 6-foot-blonde stage prowess handed her 
the rockstar nickname "bootlegs." Her crowd-shaking mix of big-room 
club, house, progressive, rock, and retro landed her in the DJ booths of 
clubs such as Avalon New York and B.E.D. Miami. Not only clubs took 
notice. She even rocked the stage with Ultra music fest favorite Kevens, 
as part of his show, and opened for music legends Steven Tyler and Chuck 
Berry. "After these past couple of years, I feel like I've reached a 
level in my artistry that measures up with the best, and I'm ready to 
own it. I recently added my first name to my former DJ name, DJ Luna. To 
me, the name Lea Luna symbolizes the final touch. I've completely 
embodied the artist I've always dreamed of being. I've become the real 
ME." ...and that she has.

Describing Lea's upcoming new release - LUNANIMOUS is one voice, one 
massive. The massive is speaking one
universal language; at every rock show, night club, house party,
through every radio station, in every ipod. Lea Luna's LUNANIMOUS is
a new dialect of the rock-tronica tongue that both the underground
and overground massives can fluently express.

"I started early, I traveled, I learned, I met people... I went through 
all kinds of music training, audio school, and this whole DJ thing 
forever. Now, I've pinpointed my love for this scene, the music, the 
lyric, my life in general, and art in general. I've defined my 
strengths, my own unique style, my inspiration, and my goals to a T. It 
all leads up to this: basically, I've lived my whole life to make this 
new music ROCK and take it to the stage."

DJ B N@$TY

B N@$TY has been making a name for himself all across the country this 
past year. After opening for Lea Luna in Reno, NV in December, they 
decided to team up again for Snuff. With his mind on the scene and the 
scene on his music, B N@$TY is laying down that Speed Garage Sound in a 
city near you. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Dave Digital vs Straight Vizual

Thats right kids, your two favorite Drum-N-Breaks DJ's are going to be 
tearing it up at the gym club. Whether its turntablism, perfect mixing, 
or just sick ass tracks, Dave Digital and Josh Vizual are 2 of the 
Tri-State's favorite tag sets. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Sat Jun 14                  MESSIN WITH SASQUATCH                Oxford, OH

Okay, we all know General Malice will kill you. We all know camping is 
okay, but camping with Sasquatch is teh $h17z!!1! We all know that this 
summer is about to fuckin pop off and Messin With Sasquatch is gonna be 
the launch pad for all the craziness this summer. So, you may be asking 
yourselves," How can I get into this event for free?". Well, there is 
one way and one way only. Ya gotta dress like a Sasquatch. Ya can't 
sneak in if ya look like a raver, only in the guise of the Yeti would 
one be able to get past security and make their way to the heart of the 
forest where all the real headz reside. If you dress like a sasquatch 
you may be able to infiltrate.

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Burufunk

With over 40 commercial releases on more than 30 labels, his success can 
be measured by his achievements. Burufunk.s debut single, .Freedom,. 
released by Kloud 9 Music and featured on the 1998 Streetbeat 
compilation, Battle on Funky Planet, made the track a hit and propelled 
the artist onto the international stage. As a respected producer and 
pioneer of the breakbeat era, Burufunk kept the ball rolling with 
several other hit singles, including the 2000 release of, .The Dream 
Experience,. on Napzzz and his now infamous, .Outsider,. which was 
featured by Nick Warren on the 2003 Global Underground compilation, 
#024: Reykjavik. After some well deserved international notoriety, many 
more opportunities presented themselves, including one that led to the 
hit Burufunk remix of BT.s, .Simply Being Loved (Somnambulist).. 
Renowned artist and producer, BT .was absolutely knocked sideways!., by 
the brilliantly crafted Burufunk remix, as was the entire dance music 
industry. Knowing it was important to work with other artists and 
performers, Burufunk forged a lifelong relationship with artists like 
Deepsky, DJ Icey, and many more.

Over time, Burufunk managed to perfect his art and build a live 
performance as energetic and creative as the sounds he brings with him. 
>From his .on the fly. sound manipulation, to his custom crafted remixes, 
Burufunk seamlessly crafts his exclusive sets right from the minds of 
his audience. Burufunk has opened for some of the biggest names in the 
industry on the most extravagant stages in the world, including the 
Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference in Miami. It was his 
2006 performance with Carbon Community in Miami, that kicked off their 
Community Funk Tour, and brought his future intentions front and center.

After several years of effective work in the industry, Burufunk teamed 
up with long-time friend and colleague, Brett Holland to help build the 
new Orlando-based indie label Shiznit Recordings, home of the hottest 
cutting edge EDM. Watch for upcoming shows and releases from Burufunk in 
2007, including the monster progressive house single .Serenity,. 
featuring vocals by 3PM, slated for a spring 2007 release on Undermine 
Records.

DJ Lea Luna

At the young age of 24, ear and eye-catching DJ Lea Luna has quite a 
handle on the club scene. She is a lifelong musician: playing keys for 
as far back as she can remember, and spinning records since she wasn't 
even of age to get into the clubs (in the underground rave heydey, 
1999). When a 16 year old girl begins sharpening mixing skills and 
stacking up an arsenal of records and CDs that soon in her life, what 
potential does she already have in the club industry when she turns 21? 
DJ Lea Luna will tell you. She's already played all over the country at 
some of the most prestigious clubs and events the commercial electronic 
scene has. Her remix sets and her 6-foot-blonde stage prowess handed her 
the rockstar nickname "bootlegs." Her crowd-shaking mix of big-room 
club, house, progressive, rock, and retro landed her in the DJ booths of 
clubs such as Avalon New York and B.E.D. Miami. Not only clubs took 
notice. She even rocked the stage with Ultra music fest favorite Kevens, 
as part of his show, and opened for music legends Steven Tyler and Chuck 
Berry. "After these past couple of years, I feel like I've reached a 
level in my artistry that measures up with the best, and I'm ready to 
own it. I recently added my first name to my former DJ name, DJ Luna. To 
me, the name Lea Luna symbolizes the final touch. I've completely 
embodied the artist I've always dreamed of being. I've become the real 
ME." ...and that she has.

Describing Lea's upcoming new release - LUNANIMOUS is one voice, one 
massive. The massive is speaking one
universal language; at every rock show, night club, house party,
through every radio station, in every ipod. Lea Luna's LUNANIMOUS is
a new dialect of the rock-tronica tongue that both the underground
and overground massives can fluently express.

"I started early, I traveled, I learned, I met people... I went through 
all kinds of music training, audio school, and this whole DJ thing 
forever. Now, I've pinpointed my love for this scene, the music, the 
lyric, my life in general, and art in general. I've defined my 
strengths, my own unique style, my inspiration, and my goals to a T. It 
all leads up to this: basically, I've lived my whole life to make this 
new music ROCK and take it to the stage."

DJ B N@$TY

B N@$TY has been making a name for himself all across the country this 
past year. After opening for Lea Luna in Reno, NV in December, they 
decided to team up again for Snuff. With his mind on the scene and the 
scene on his music, B N@$TY is laying down that Speed Garage Sound in a 
city near you. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Dave Digital vs Straight Vizual

Thats right kids, your two favorite Drum-N-Breaks DJ's are going to be 
tearing it up at the gym club. Whether its turntablism, perfect mixing, 
or just sick ass tracks, Dave Digital and Josh Vizual are 2 of the 
Tri-State's favorite tag sets. Sloppy Cincy, GSP

Sat Jun 14                  MESSIN WITH SASQUATCH                Oxford, OH

Okay, we all know General Malice will kill you. We all know camping is 
okay, but camping with Sasquatch is teh $h17z!!1! We all know that this 
summer is about to fuckin pop off and Messin With Sasquatch is gonna be 
the launch pad for all the craziness this summer. So, you may be asking 
yourselves," How can I get into this event for free?". Well, there is 
one way and one way only. Ya gotta dress like a Sasquatch. Ya can't 
sneak in if ya look like a raver, only in the guise of the Yeti would 
one be able to get past security and make their way to the heart of the 
forest where all the real headz reside. If you dress like a sasquatch 
you may be able to infiltrate.

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.
