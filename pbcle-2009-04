Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

You got some funny pics from Kiss the Sky. I like the booty shot of that
one hooker. Classic!

I even managed to sneak into a picture, but I look scared or something.
Maybe I was scared of the gimp they had down in the basement? haha

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Wed Apr 08                          RUSKO                        Pittsburgh

Rusko LIVE feat. Rod Azlan

http://www.myspace.com/ruskonfire

Bio:

Christopher Mercer, aka Rusko was born in Leeds in 1985 to a musical 
family. From day dot Rusko was surrounded by music whether it be his 
families piano.s, guitars, banjo.s and saxophones.or in his later years 
the heavy reggae and dub sound systems of Leeds, music has always been 
an integral part of Rusko.s life.

After graduating from Leeds university with a degree in musical 
performance, Rusko discovered the world of dubstep through SUB DUB and a 
debut appearance from the .Digital Mystikz., having spent the past 10 
years making future dub alongside Leeds very own Iration Steppas, Rusko 
connected with the sound and moved down to London to further advance his 
musical opportunities with Sub Soldiers label mate Caspa.

Veering away from the dark, serious side of the sound Rusko bought a 
highly driven energy and fun approach to the dubstep massive and quickly 
coined his own take on the genre and turned the scene upside down. His 
sound appealed to many people outside of the dubstep world as his 
productions became more adventurous in formula, sound and energy. His 
huge hit .Cockney Thug. has been played by everyone from Pete Tong, 
Switch, Diplo and Santogold. And has been remixed by Buraka Som sistema, 
Diplo, Drop the Lime and the Scratch Perverts.

His sound continues to develop with different BPM.s that lean to jungle, 
house, hip hop or electro, either way, whatever BPM or tempo.you can 
immediately tell a Rusko track.

At 23 Rusko is only in 1st gear, with collaborations on the table with 
the likes of Switch, Diplo , Yo Majesty and Wiley the future sure is 
looking bright. Already setting the radio airwaves alight with his own 
productions and remixes of artists such as Adele, A-Trak featuring Kid 
Sister, Leon Jean-Marie Rusko is only going in one direction. Onwards, 
upwards and far beyond any producer could dream of. Rusko is like Dr 
Dre, Timbaland and Switch all rolled into one with a serious overdose of 
bass.

Sat May 09                      FOREVER YOUNG                       Toronto

The magic. The mystery. The music. There's nothing quite like raving. 
Every time you walk in the door, you're transported to a timeless land 
of peace, love, unity and respect; a place where the beat never stops 
and the wonders never cease; home away from home. You know how amazing 
it feels.

So do we.

We remember our first glimpse into the magical world that is raving. We 
remember the bracelets, the smiles, the hugs, the lasers, the music. And 
even though we've grown older, so long as we have raving in our lives, 
we never have to grow up.

On May 9th, join Nocturnal Commissions as we celebrate the wonder and 
magic of all things rave. Get out your brightest bracelets and your fun 
fur pants; bring along your old half-filled PLUR book; buy a new Vicks 
inhaler and a pair of glowsticks.

We are bright.

We are happy.

We are loving.

We are Toronto's Happy Hardcore ravers, and we are...

FOREVER YOUNG!

Featuring...

::Charles Feelgood::
Supacutz, myspace.com/charlesfeelgoodmusic
//funky shit-hard house-techno-electro
Legendary for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the 
Baltimore/Washington DC area, Charles Feelgood has built a reputation as 
a DJ in the international dance community through his ingenious remix 
skills and a dynamic brand of funky disco and hard house.

The consummated dance floor rocker, Feelgood sums up his musical mission 
in one sentence: "I just want to do what the name implies, to make 
people have a good time and go home with a great feeling."

He is sure to have you grinning from ear to ear so much it will make 
your face hurt. There is almost no way to stand still while this man is 
on the decks. His tunes will definitely have you feeling good (if not 
super awesome) the whole entire time.


::ramz::
District Ignition / Washington DC (First Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
//minimal-house-trace-and more...
Back in the days of the dinosaurs a caveman found music by beating two 
rocks together. After a major ice storm the caveman was frozen and his 
body was found in a glacier in the mountains. He was then taken to 
Washington, DC where he was left to thaw.

After regaining consciousness he learned to speak English and was given 
a name . Jason Ramsey. Jason soon drew musical inspiration from a very 
eclectic set of artists. Near the height of the nineties, he drew from 
this inspiration to establish himself as a dj in Washington, DC, taking 
on the moniker of .ramz..

More recently, Jason has developed his musical tastes from the tribal 
and progressive he was known for in the years of Buzz to a more refined 
taste which revolves around a combination of minimal, Swedish house and 
a small taste of trance when it's necessary. Jason has not only been 
invited to open the stage for dj's such as Gabriel & Dresden, George 
Acosta & BT but his mix series "Aural Fixation" has been in high demand 
across the country. That's a pretty good resume for a displaced 
homo-sapien from the Paleolithic era.

::DJ 2Rip::
District Ignition / Washington DC
//anything and everything
Some people filter through the music, purchasing music that is 
acceptable because everyone else is listening to it or because .it.s 
hot.. Then there are people who dig deep to find unique music that isn.t 
necessarily being sustained by pop culture. There are the people who 
absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking trends . forever on 
a quest to find the perfect record. DJ 2rip falls into the latter 
category.

He has made his mark over the course of a decade by hosting events 
around the mid-Atlantic, including abandoned apartment buildings and 
warehouse lofts to superclubs like Ibiza and Fur. With many ups and 
downs throughout his career his music has always been edgy and upfront. 
With that notion constantly in mind, DJ 2rip also maintains an ability 
to span several genres to create a unique musical journey.

He will fill your dancing shoes with pure awesomeness!!

::The Breakbeat Militia::
3x4 Clevr X Moose X Zone
breakbeatmilitia.com, Nexnap, djmoose.com Pittsburgh/Cleveland
//uhh...Breaks?

The name is synonymous with breakbeat perfection.

They have been mixing records since some of us were still in diapers and 
have so much skill between the 3 of them they could just spontaneously 
combust at any moment when they are on the decks. So watch out!! Even if 
they don't catch on fire, the dancefloor surely will, so make sure you 
wear flame retardant shoes!

::Eryn Evans::
B.A.D. Ass, Sinister Movement
//Bassline
You know her, you love her, you want to have 1000 babies with her, but 
she won't let you. Oh well, at least she will come out and blow you away 
with her bassline madness. Prepare your minds/bodies/souls for this 
earth shaking performance.

::abZ::
savoryaudio.com, FUZZ!
//Dubstep
According to an article in Pittsburgh's CP from 2007, AbZ was credited 
with bringing dubstep to Pittsburgh. He is a very skilled producer whose 
tracks are getting a lot of attention these days! Not to mention that he 
just recently started his own digital label (Savory Audio). His mixes 
are smooth and fresh and sure to make you get down and dirty.

::Nice Nate::
Flux Capacitor, B.A.D. Ass, Sunset til Sunrise, Glow
//Tech-electro
This up and coming PGH dj/producer is starting to blow up around these 
parts! Nice Nate will certainly make you feel very nice and sexy with 
his A++ track selection. No public masturbation allowed! This is all 
ages you know! Don't miss out on this up and coming PGH DJ!!!

Dude... Dennis and Dave from Skylab were pretty cool. Didn't you go to  
the rock and roll hall of fame with us that one day when they were in  
town? I remember the show they did in Dayton for new year's eve in  
1998, and they were AWESOME. That's when the one dude started peeing  
on himself and everyone watched. I think we've talked about that  
before here on good ol' pb-cle.

I remember you pounding some music from the prope outside the agora  
one day. Or, where were we? I just remember some neighborhood kids  
being around and there were warehouse buildings around and the music  
was bouncing all over them. It was loud, crazy and fun.


I was thinking today about those after-hours parties in the flats.

I will never forget what might have been one of the last ones I went to.

It was the morning after  "Submerged 2" (or was it 3?) got shut down.

It wasn't the one at peabody's... it was the one at the big  
warehouse....

Everyone was SO mad at  us. Viktor was so upset, he didn't go, he just  
drove back to Columbus broke and upset.

There was a crazy rumor that we had the party shut down on purpose or  
something.

All I know is that after setting up, I drove home around 9 to Akron to  
take a shower and clean up. I got back to that place around 11:00 and  
saw a huge line of people, not to mention "people" on the roof. It was  
the moment I walked in the back office door that about 40 heavily  
armed swat / vice dudes busted in from every direction. There was a  
whole conversation in the office about how the building didn't have an  
occupancy permit. We called the guy that owned the building and put  
him on the phone with the cops, and at that point realized full out  
that this was not the first time it had happened. I guess the last  
time they broke something up, there was a private party in the space  
(which was huge), where people had strippers and they were gambling.
After the fact, it was learned that someone to remain nameless  
(commercial promoter dude) had a beef with viktor and called in a  
variety of complaints to the police telling them that something shady  
was happening there that evening.

Needless to say, everyone had to leave, we had to clean up, and after  
paying people out, our pal from Russia was out a ton of money.

Anyway, we ended up in the park under the bridge in the flats around  
sunrise and people were in full force. After setting things straight  
with why things got shut down, people ended up being cool. (for a  
while). There was great music because there was a power outlet in the  
middle of the park near that concrete wall. I remember a police boat  
going down the river and all the cops waving at people dancing. They  
never bothered us down there

... until later that day when a bunch of crackhead ravers decided to  
not respect the property around the park. There was a marina down  
there, and people HAD to go sneak in and do shady things, causing the  
calls to the police. Needless to say, the fun ended soon after.

But it went on until the afternoon, and it was a great day. I liked  
after-hours in that park. It was 'real'.  I remember also going to  
after-hours parties at edgewater park too. Where else? I feel like  
reminiscing.

The last after-party I went to in the park was after one of Kerry and  
Brian's parties at the agora. (I think that was the last time). I was  
dating that girl named leigh (who I am sure brian remembers).

Man oh man. Those were fun times. Hard to believe that party was 10  
years ago. It seems like yesterday.

Brian... We should catch up. I'd love to know the scoop on all the old  
peeps.  I have no idea who is on this list still besides trout and the  
other usual suspects, but I still stay in "sorta communication" with  
some people. I talk to Andy the Pooh (did I just say that?) more than  
anyone. Can you believe that we STILL have the selekta server online?  
We've changed the hardware, but it's been running for over 10 years,  
although the site hasn't been updated in like... um... er... 4 years.  
eek. Oh whatever, it is nostalgic.

Casey? Wayne? Are you on here? Erica?  Kelly C?

Oh yeah, and from the looks of it, it seems like there are parties  
again ? In Chicago, it is basically club cheesiness, and there might  
be parties, but they are in the burbs and look pretty bad. It isn't  
anything like it used to be. From 2000 until 2004 or so, there wasn't  
anything at all really. Small things, and still good music, but no big  
blow-outs. Then loft parties here got hot again. Now there is no  
respect for good DJs and it seems like everything in the clubs is lame  
and all about being a hipster wannabe DJ using Serato to do bad  
mashups and annoy people with a 23-year old's passion for the 80's.

Sigh. I remember the 80's well. And I also remember that in 1990 we  
all rejoiced because bad 80's clothes and hair was finally behind us.  
(although looking like vanilla ice and rockin' NWA while smoking crack  
was all the new rage). haha.

Anyway... hi folks.

-meek

Ps - Hi Akron. I don't really miss you, but I still love you after all  
these years.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way

Wed Apr 08                          RUSKO                        Pittsburgh

Rusko LIVE feat. Rod Azlan

http://www.myspace.com/ruskonfire

Bio:

Christopher Mercer, aka Rusko was born in Leeds in 1985 to a musical 
family. From day dot Rusko was surrounded by music whether it be his 
families piano.s, guitars, banjo.s and saxophones.or in his later years 
the heavy reggae and dub sound systems of Leeds, music has always been 
an integral part of Rusko.s life.

After graduating from Leeds university with a degree in musical 
performance, Rusko discovered the world of dubstep through SUB DUB and a 
debut appearance from the .Digital Mystikz., having spent the past 10 
years making future dub alongside Leeds very own Iration Steppas, Rusko 
connected with the sound and moved down to London to further advance his 
musical opportunities with Sub Soldiers label mate Caspa.

Veering away from the dark, serious side of the sound Rusko bought a 
highly driven energy and fun approach to the dubstep massive and quickly 
coined his own take on the genre and turned the scene upside down. His 
sound appealed to many people outside of the dubstep world as his 
productions became more adventurous in formula, sound and energy. His 
huge hit .Cockney Thug. has been played by everyone from Pete Tong, 
Switch, Diplo and Santogold. And has been remixed by Buraka Som sistema, 
Diplo, Drop the Lime and the Scratch Perverts.

His sound continues to develop with different BPM.s that lean to jungle, 
house, hip hop or electro, either way, whatever BPM or tempo.you can 
immediately tell a Rusko track.

At 23 Rusko is only in 1st gear, with collaborations on the table with 
the likes of Switch, Diplo , Yo Majesty and Wiley the future sure is 
looking bright. Already setting the radio airwaves alight with his own 
productions and remixes of artists such as Adele, A-Trak featuring Kid 
Sister, Leon Jean-Marie Rusko is only going in one direction. Onwards, 
upwards and far beyond any producer could dream of. Rusko is like Dr 
Dre, Timbaland and Switch all rolled into one with a serious overdose of 
bass.

Sat Apr 25                        DARKRAVE                        Cleveland

While this is more a blacklight night than a rave, I'm sure some of the 
people here would enjoy it. The music will be mostly electro-industrial, 
and we'll probably go for more rhythmic tracks. And we'll be killing the 
dance floor lights for a good portion of the night.

We'll have some other goodies for this night as well- including some UV 
sensitive drinks!

Humanaut & Technoir Audio proudly present:

FRIDAY, MAY 1st, 2009

Stewart Walker {Live} [Persona Records - Tresor] Berlin
www.stewartwalker.com

Berlin-based STEWART WALKER is a restless innovator. After making a 
splash in the late nineties on definitive labels like Force Inc. and 
Tresor, he.s had an inestimable impact on the development of current 
club sounds, yet consistently chooses the less traveled road: working as 
live producer in a world of DJs; injecting emotion into functional 
electronic dance music; quietly building a label family of 
unclassifiable artists on his own imprint, Persona.

After selling his guitar in 1993, Walker began assembling a synth-based 
hardware studio while in university in Athens, GA. Inspired by Jeff 
Mills. Live at the Liquid Room he became obsessed with rhythm. A string 
of recordings appeared on Matrix Records in Detroit . including the 1997 
single Amphetamine Sulphate . and later on Deepfried (Grand Rapids, MI) 
and Tektite (Austin, TX). A year later, his first European release 
Artificial Music for Artificial People was picked up by Cristian Vogel's 
British imprint, Mosquito, and Walker hit the live circuit. Armed with 
only an AKAI MPC2000 sampler and a DJ mixer, he did what a DJ never 
could: move a club crowd with sounds shaped by his own hands. This 
original approach was welcomed across Europe and in Japan as well as his 
native US.

1999 saw Walker.s debut on Berlin.s Tresor Records with Nothing Produces 
Stark Imagery, followed up by the now-classic minimalist experiment, 
Stabiles, on Mille Plateaux. These productions proved to be seminal in 
the development of minimal techno.

Walker continued to release on labels such as Minus and Force Inc. 
until, in 2001, he set up his own imprint, Persona Records. Persona 
released eleven records in the US culminating in the second landmark 
album of Walker.s career to date: Live Extracts (2003). Live Extracts 
captured the sound and atmospherics of Walker.s in-club performances and 
was soon licensed by Tresor.

Persona restarted in 2005, this time in Berlin. Now based in Europe, 
Walker performed in every capital and made incursions as far afield as 
Australia and Russia. Soon after, he released the downtempo album 
Grounded in Existence and a breakbeaty techno EP, Travel Plaza. These 
releases showcased Walker.s increasing attention to nuance, dynamics, 
and melody.

Concentricity, Walker.s fourth full-length, was released in 2007.

1) This is a very different event than normal. You MUST MUST MUST have a 
presale ticket. The party will be going down in the main recording 
studio of Machine Age. It only holds 170 people. That's it. Between 
Technoir Audio & Humanaut we are going to clear through these tickets at 
warp speed so MAKE SURE you get one.

Presales - $10 and will be available soon.

2) This is a LOCK-IN. As in....everyone MUST arrive with their ticket in 
hand by 11:30 pm to get in. The doors will shut at 11:30 and nobody else 
will be admitted, ticketed or not.

3) Because this isn't a bar, the party is BYOB. May I suggest a (small) 
cooler or a backpack of some sort? We don't want to clog the place with 
huge coolers, so keep it in something that can be tucked away please!

4) We will go as late as people want to stay and people want to DJ. That 
means at least 4am.

Get ready! We are ridiculously excited to be hosting such a legendary 
artist! This is one of only TWO gigs in the US along with the [kontrol] 
party in San Francisco @ The Endup. It is basically a house party in a 
badass music studio, with a small group of friends, on turbosound, with 
one of the residents of the most famous German techno club in the world 
. Tresor.

This will be one for the record books!

The address of the studios will be released before the party . it is 
centrally located right off Bigelow Blvd. Tickets available soon!

Sat May 09                      FOREVER YOUNG                       Toronto

The magic. The mystery. The music. There's nothing quite like raving. 
Every time you walk in the door, you're transported to a timeless land 
of peace, love, unity and respect; a place where the beat never stops 
and the wonders never cease; home away from home. You know how amazing 
it feels.

So do we.

We remember our first glimpse into the magical world that is raving. We 
remember the bracelets, the smiles, the hugs, the lasers, the music. And 
even though we've grown older, so long as we have raving in our lives, 
we never have to grow up.

On May 9th, join Nocturnal Commissions as we celebrate the wonder and 
magic of all things rave. Get out your brightest bracelets and your fun 
fur pants; bring along your old half-filled PLUR book; buy a new Vicks 
inhaler and a pair of glowsticks.

We are bright.

We are happy.

We are loving.

We are Toronto's Happy Hardcore ravers, and we are...

FOREVER YOUNG!

Featuring...

::Charles Feelgood::
Supacutz, myspace.com/charlesfeelgoodmusic
//funky shit-hard house-techno-electro
Legendary for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the 
Baltimore/Washington DC area, Charles Feelgood has built a reputation as 
a DJ in the international dance community through his ingenious remix 
skills and a dynamic brand of funky disco and hard house.

The consummated dance floor rocker, Feelgood sums up his musical mission 
in one sentence: "I just want to do what the name implies, to make 
people have a good time and go home with a great feeling."

He is sure to have you grinning from ear to ear so much it will make 
your face hurt. There is almost no way to stand still while this man is 
on the decks. His tunes will definitely have you feeling good (if not 
super awesome) the whole entire time.


::ramz::
District Ignition / Washington DC (First Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
//minimal-house-trace-and more...
Back in the days of the dinosaurs a caveman found music by beating two 
rocks together. After a major ice storm the caveman was frozen and his 
body was found in a glacier in the mountains. He was then taken to 
Washington, DC where he was left to thaw.

After regaining consciousness he learned to speak English and was given 
a name . Jason Ramsey. Jason soon drew musical inspiration from a very 
eclectic set of artists. Near the height of the nineties, he drew from 
this inspiration to establish himself as a dj in Washington, DC, taking 
on the moniker of .ramz..

More recently, Jason has developed his musical tastes from the tribal 
and progressive he was known for in the years of Buzz to a more refined 
taste which revolves around a combination of minimal, Swedish house and 
a small taste of trance when it's necessary. Jason has not only been 
invited to open the stage for dj's such as Gabriel & Dresden, George 
Acosta & BT but his mix series "Aural Fixation" has been in high demand 
across the country. That's a pretty good resume for a displaced 
homo-sapien from the Paleolithic era.

::DJ 2Rip::
District Ignition / Washington DC
//anything and everything
Some people filter through the music, purchasing music that is 
acceptable because everyone else is listening to it or because .it.s 
hot.. Then there are people who dig deep to find unique music that isn.t 
necessarily being sustained by pop culture. There are the people who 
absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking trends . forever on 
a quest to find the perfect record. DJ 2rip falls into the latter 
category.

He has made his mark over the course of a decade by hosting events 
around the mid-Atlantic, including abandoned apartment buildings and 
warehouse lofts to superclubs like Ibiza and Fur. With many ups and 
downs throughout his career his music has always been edgy and upfront. 
With that notion constantly in mind, DJ 2rip also maintains an ability 
to span several genres to create a unique musical journey.

He will fill your dancing shoes with pure awesomeness!!

::The Breakbeat Militia::
3x4 Clevr X Moose X Zone
breakbeatmilitia.com, Nexnap, djmoose.com Pittsburgh/Cleveland
//uhh...Breaks?

The name is synonymous with breakbeat perfection.

They have been mixing records since some of us were still in diapers and 
have so much skill between the 3 of them they could just spontaneously 
combust at any moment when they are on the decks. So watch out!! Even if 
they don't catch on fire, the dancefloor surely will, so make sure you 
wear flame retardant shoes!

::Eryn Evans::
B.A.D. Ass, Sinister Movement
//Bassline
You know her, you love her, you want to have 1000 babies with her, but 
she won't let you. Oh well, at least she will come out and blow you away 
with her bassline madness. Prepare your minds/bodies/souls for this 
earth shaking performance.

::abZ::
savoryaudio.com, FUZZ!
//Dubstep
According to an article in Pittsburgh's CP from 2007, AbZ was credited 
with bringing dubstep to Pittsburgh. He is a very skilled producer whose 
tracks are getting a lot of attention these days! Not to mention that he 
just recently started his own digital label (Savory Audio). His mixes 
are smooth and fresh and sure to make you get down and dirty.

::Nice Nate::
Flux Capacitor, B.A.D. Ass, Sunset til Sunrise, Glow
//Tech-electro
This up and coming PGH dj/producer is starting to blow up around these 
parts! Nice Nate will certainly make you feel very nice and sexy with 
his A++ track selection. No public masturbation allowed! This is all 
ages you know! Don't miss out on this up and coming PGH DJ!!!

Jun 11-14                GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL                Maryland

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air - truly, a magical event which has established itself as the 
annual summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes!

Currently in its eighth year, the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted 
the world's leading international talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the finest national and 
regional talent from the USA, becoming the premier destination for 
hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The gathering includes a 
full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, lectures and 
workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and much more at our 
spectacular, new location, Ramblewood!

www.GMSF.us / www.Gaian-Mind.com / www.Ramblewood.com
NEW LOCATION, NEW DATES

Presenting the 8th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009
Ramblewood, Darlington, Maryland, USA

We are happy to announce our new location - Ramblewood! Ramblewood is 
ideally located minutes from historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, and is 
convenient to Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and NYC. Unlike 
most places that do not understand or tolerate "alternative" groups, 
Ramblewood especially tries to cater to these groups which have a hard 
time finding a safe place to hold their events. Ramblewood understands 
and offers these groups a chance to meet in a beautiful natural 
environment, without fear of judgement or persecution.

Remember, GMSF2009 will be on the weekend before the summer solstice 
this year - Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009. We hope to 
reschedule the event on the summer solstice in the upcoming year...
EARLYBIRD TICKET SALES

Earlybird Tickets are ON SALE NOW - Wednesday, April 1st to Wednesday,

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Apr 25                        DARKRAVE                        Cleveland

While this is more a blacklight night than a rave, I'm sure some of the 
people here would enjoy it. The music will be mostly electro-industrial, 
and we'll probably go for more rhythmic tracks. And we'll be killing the 
dance floor lights for a good portion of the night.

We'll have some other goodies for this night as well- including some UV 
sensitive drinks!

Humanaut & Technoir Audio proudly present:

FRIDAY, MAY 1st, 2009

Stewart Walker {Live} [Persona Records - Tresor] Berlin
www.stewartwalker.com

Berlin-based STEWART WALKER is a restless innovator. After making a 
splash in the late nineties on definitive labels like Force Inc. and 
Tresor, he.s had an inestimable impact on the development of current 
club sounds, yet consistently chooses the less traveled road: working as 
live producer in a world of DJs; injecting emotion into functional 
electronic dance music; quietly building a label family of 
unclassifiable artists on his own imprint, Persona.

After selling his guitar in 1993, Walker began assembling a synth-based 
hardware studio while in university in Athens, GA. Inspired by Jeff 
Mills. Live at the Liquid Room he became obsessed with rhythm. A string 
of recordings appeared on Matrix Records in Detroit . including the 1997 
single Amphetamine Sulphate . and later on Deepfried (Grand Rapids, MI) 
and Tektite (Austin, TX). A year later, his first European release 
Artificial Music for Artificial People was picked up by Cristian Vogel's 
British imprint, Mosquito, and Walker hit the live circuit. Armed with 
only an AKAI MPC2000 sampler and a DJ mixer, he did what a DJ never 
could: move a club crowd with sounds shaped by his own hands. This 
original approach was welcomed across Europe and in Japan as well as his 
native US.

1999 saw Walker.s debut on Berlin.s Tresor Records with Nothing Produces 
Stark Imagery, followed up by the now-classic minimalist experiment, 
Stabiles, on Mille Plateaux. These productions proved to be seminal in 
the development of minimal techno.

Walker continued to release on labels such as Minus and Force Inc. 
until, in 2001, he set up his own imprint, Persona Records. Persona 
released eleven records in the US culminating in the second landmark 
album of Walker.s career to date: Live Extracts (2003). Live Extracts 
captured the sound and atmospherics of Walker.s in-club performances and 
was soon licensed by Tresor.

Persona restarted in 2005, this time in Berlin. Now based in Europe, 
Walker performed in every capital and made incursions as far afield as 
Australia and Russia. Soon after, he released the downtempo album 
Grounded in Existence and a breakbeaty techno EP, Travel Plaza. These 
releases showcased Walker.s increasing attention to nuance, dynamics, 
and melody.

Concentricity, Walker.s fourth full-length, was released in 2007.

Also featuring:
Shawn Rudiman {Live} [Technoir Audio - PGH]
Chris O'Connor [Technoir Audio - PGH]
Jwan Allen [Technoir Audio - PGH]

------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the deal people - pay attention:

1) This is a very different event than normal. You MUST MUST MUST have a 
presale ticket. The party will be going down in the main recording 
studio of Machine Age. It only holds 170 people. That's it. Between 
Technoir Audio & Humanaut we are going to clear through these tickets at 
warp speed so MAKE SURE you get one.

Presales - $10 and will be available soon.

2) This is a LOCK-IN. As in....everyone MUST arrive with their ticket in 
hand by 11:30 pm to get in. The doors will shut at 11:30 and nobody else 
will be admitted, ticketed or not.

3) Because this isn't a bar, the party is BYOB. May I suggest a (small) 
cooler or a backpack of some sort? We don't want to clog the place with 
huge coolers, so keep it in something that can be tucked away please!

4) We will go as late as people want to stay and people want to DJ. That 
means at least 4am.

Get ready! We are ridiculously excited to be hosting such a legendary 
artist! This is one of only TWO gigs in the US along with the [kontrol] 
party in San Francisco @ The Endup. It is basically a house party in a 
badass music studio, with a small group of friends, on turbosound, with 
one of the residents of the most famous German techno club in the world 
. Tresor.

This will be one for the record books!

The address of the studios will be released before the party . it is 
centrally located right off Bigelow Blvd. Tickets available soon!

Sat May 09                      FOREVER YOUNG                       Toronto

The magic. The mystery. The music. There's nothing quite like raving. 
Every time you walk in the door, you're transported to a timeless land 
of peace, love, unity and respect; a place where the beat never stops 
and the wonders never cease; home away from home. You know how amazing 
it feels.

So do we.

We remember our first glimpse into the magical world that is raving. We 
remember the bracelets, the smiles, the hugs, the lasers, the music. And 
even though we've grown older, so long as we have raving in our lives, 
we never have to grow up.

On May 9th, join Nocturnal Commissions as we celebrate the wonder and 
magic of all things rave. Get out your brightest bracelets and your fun 
fur pants; bring along your old half-filled PLUR book; buy a new Vicks 
inhaler and a pair of glowsticks.

We are bright.

We are happy.

We are loving.

We are Toronto's Happy Hardcore ravers, and we are...

FOREVER YOUNG!

Featuring...

::Charles Feelgood::
Supacutz, myspace.com/charlesfeelgoodmusic
//funky shit-hard house-techno-electro
Legendary for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the 
Baltimore/Washington DC area, Charles Feelgood has built a reputation as 
a DJ in the international dance community through his ingenious remix 
skills and a dynamic brand of funky disco and hard house.

The consummated dance floor rocker, Feelgood sums up his musical mission 
in one sentence: "I just want to do what the name implies, to make 
people have a good time and go home with a great feeling."

He is sure to have you grinning from ear to ear so much it will make 
your face hurt. There is almost no way to stand still while this man is 
on the decks. His tunes will definitely have you feeling good (if not 
super awesome) the whole entire time.


::ramz::
District Ignition / Washington DC (First Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
//minimal-house-trace-and more...
Back in the days of the dinosaurs a caveman found music by beating two 
rocks together. After a major ice storm the caveman was frozen and his 
body was found in a glacier in the mountains. He was then taken to 
Washington, DC where he was left to thaw.

After regaining consciousness he learned to speak English and was given 
a name . Jason Ramsey. Jason soon drew musical inspiration from a very 
eclectic set of artists. Near the height of the nineties, he drew from 
this inspiration to establish himself as a dj in Washington, DC, taking 
on the moniker of .ramz..

More recently, Jason has developed his musical tastes from the tribal 
and progressive he was known for in the years of Buzz to a more refined 
taste which revolves around a combination of minimal, Swedish house and 
a small taste of trance when it's necessary. Jason has not only been 
invited to open the stage for dj's such as Gabriel & Dresden, George 
Acosta & BT but his mix series "Aural Fixation" has been in high demand 
across the country. That's a pretty good resume for a displaced 
homo-sapien from the Paleolithic era.

::DJ 2Rip::
District Ignition / Washington DC
//anything and everything
Some people filter through the music, purchasing music that is 
acceptable because everyone else is listening to it or because .it.s 
hot.. Then there are people who dig deep to find unique music that isn.t 
necessarily being sustained by pop culture. There are the people who 
absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking trends . forever on 
a quest to find the perfect record. DJ 2rip falls into the latter 
category.

He has made his mark over the course of a decade by hosting events 
around the mid-Atlantic, including abandoned apartment buildings and 
warehouse lofts to superclubs like Ibiza and Fur. With many ups and 
downs throughout his career his music has always been edgy and upfront. 
With that notion constantly in mind, DJ 2rip also maintains an ability 
to span several genres to create a unique musical journey.

He will fill your dancing shoes with pure awesomeness!!

::The Breakbeat Militia::
3x4 Clevr X Moose X Zone
breakbeatmilitia.com, Nexnap, djmoose.com Pittsburgh/Cleveland
//uhh...Breaks?

The name is synonymous with breakbeat perfection.

They have been mixing records since some of us were still in diapers and 
have so much skill between the 3 of them they could just spontaneously 
combust at any moment when they are on the decks. So watch out!! Even if 
they don't catch on fire, the dancefloor surely will, so make sure you 
wear flame retardant shoes!

::Eryn Evans::
B.A.D. Ass, Sinister Movement
//Bassline
You know her, you love her, you want to have 1000 babies with her, but 
she won't let you. Oh well, at least she will come out and blow you away 
with her bassline madness. Prepare your minds/bodies/souls for this 
earth shaking performance.

::abZ::
savoryaudio.com, FUZZ!
//Dubstep
According to an article in Pittsburgh's CP from 2007, AbZ was credited 
with bringing dubstep to Pittsburgh. He is a very skilled producer whose 
tracks are getting a lot of attention these days! Not to mention that he 
just recently started his own digital label (Savory Audio). His mixes 
are smooth and fresh and sure to make you get down and dirty.

::Nice Nate::
Flux Capacitor, B.A.D. Ass, Sunset til Sunrise, Glow
//Tech-electro
This up and coming PGH dj/producer is starting to blow up around these 
parts! Nice Nate will certainly make you feel very nice and sexy with 
his A++ track selection. No public masturbation allowed! This is all 
ages you know! Don't miss out on this up and coming PGH DJ!!!

Jun 11-14                GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL                Maryland

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air - truly, a magical event which has established itself as the 
annual summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes!

Currently in its eighth year, the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted 
the world's leading international talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the finest national and 
regional talent from the USA, becoming the premier destination for 
hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The gathering includes a 
full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, lectures and 
workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and much more at our 
spectacular, new location, Ramblewood!

www.GMSF.us / www.Gaian-Mind.com / www.Ramblewood.com
NEW LOCATION, NEW DATES

Presenting the 8th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009
Ramblewood, Darlington, Maryland, USA

We are happy to announce our new location - Ramblewood! Ramblewood is 
ideally located minutes from historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, and is 
convenient to Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and NYC. Unlike 
most places that do not understand or tolerate "alternative" groups, 
Ramblewood especially tries to cater to these groups which have a hard 
time finding a safe place to hold their events. Ramblewood understands 
and offers these groups a chance to meet in a beautiful natural 
environment, without fear of judgement or persecution.

Remember, GMSF2009 will be on the weekend before the summer solstice 
this year - Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009. We hope to 
reschedule the event on the summer solstice in the upcoming year...
EARLYBIRD TICKET SALES

Earlybird Tickets are ON SALE NOW - Wednesday, April 1st to Wednesday, 
April 8th, 2009! Please take advantage of this limited time to purchase 
event tickets at a reduced rate, plus accommodations and meal plans. Be 
sure to remind your friends! Thank you for your support!
LINE-UP

We will be posting the line-up for GMSF2009 on April 1st, 2009. Stay 
tuned! Look for our main flyer to hit the streets the following week. 
Remember to check our website frequently for late additions and updates!
WORKSHOPS

Would you like to share a workshop with the community at GMSF2009? 
Please contact Jeremy at workshops@gaian-mind.com for details. We

host a workshop? If you are attending the festival and would like to 
volunteer to host a workshop, please contact us. We'd love to 
incorporate all kinds of workshops: movement-based, skill and 
knowledge-sharing, lectures and discussions. The possibilities are 
endless! We look forward to working with YOU to make 2009 another great 
year for Gaian Mind!
CHILDREN'S AREA

Our children's area, KINDERTRIBE, continues to grow every year! Are you 
a parent that would like to add to our activities? Please contact Megan 
at kindertribe@gaian-mind.com for details. Remember, KINDERTRIBE is not 
a baby-sitting service - parents are required to remain with their 
children at all times.

GMSF2009. Please contact Inna at volunteers@gaian-mind.com with your 
contact information and skil set.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Sat Apr 25                        DARKRAVE                        Cleveland

While this is more a blacklight night than a rave, I'm sure some of the 
people here would enjoy it. The music will be mostly electro-industrial, 
and we'll probably go for more rhythmic tracks. And we'll be killing the 
dance floor lights for a good portion of the night.

We'll have some other goodies for this night as well- including some UV 
sensitive drinks!

Humanaut & Technoir Audio proudly present:

FRIDAY, MAY 1st, 2009

Stewart Walker {Live} [Persona Records - Tresor] Berlin
www.stewartwalker.com

Berlin-based STEWART WALKER is a restless innovator. After making a 
splash in the late nineties on definitive labels like Force Inc. and 
Tresor, he.s had an inestimable impact on the development of current 
club sounds, yet consistently chooses the less traveled road: working as 
live producer in a world of DJs; injecting emotion into functional 
electronic dance music; quietly building a label family of 
unclassifiable artists on his own imprint, Persona.

After selling his guitar in 1993, Walker began assembling a synth-based 
hardware studio while in university in Athens, GA. Inspired by Jeff 
Mills. Live at the Liquid Room he became obsessed with rhythm. A string 
of recordings appeared on Matrix Records in Detroit . including the 1997 
single Amphetamine Sulphate . and later on Deepfried (Grand Rapids, MI) 
and Tektite (Austin, TX). A year later, his first European release 
Artificial Music for Artificial People was picked up by Cristian Vogel's 
British imprint, Mosquito, and Walker hit the live circuit. Armed with 
only an AKAI MPC2000 sampler and a DJ mixer, he did what a DJ never 
could: move a club crowd with sounds shaped by his own hands. This 
original approach was welcomed across Europe and in Japan as well as his 
native US.

1999 saw Walker.s debut on Berlin.s Tresor Records with Nothing Produces 
Stark Imagery, followed up by the now-classic minimalist experiment, 
Stabiles, on Mille Plateaux. These productions proved to be seminal in 
the development of minimal techno.

Walker continued to release on labels such as Minus and Force Inc. 
until, in 2001, he set up his own imprint, Persona Records. Persona 
released eleven records in the US culminating in the second landmark 
album of Walker.s career to date: Live Extracts (2003). Live Extracts 
captured the sound and atmospherics of Walker.s in-club performances and 
was soon licensed by Tresor.

Persona restarted in 2005, this time in Berlin. Now based in Europe, 
Walker performed in every capital and made incursions as far afield as 
Australia and Russia. Soon after, he released the downtempo album 
Grounded in Existence and a breakbeaty techno EP, Travel Plaza. These 
releases showcased Walker.s increasing attention to nuance, dynamics, 
and melody.

Concentricity, Walker.s fourth full-length, was released in 2007.

Also featuring:
Shawn Rudiman {Live} [Technoir Audio - PGH]
Chris O'Connor [Technoir Audio - PGH]
Jwan Allen [Technoir Audio - PGH]

------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the deal people - pay attention:

1) This is a very different event than normal. You MUST MUST MUST have a 
presale ticket. The party will be going down in the main recording 
studio of Machine Age. It only holds 170 people. That's it. Between 
Technoir Audio & Humanaut we are going to clear through these tickets at 
warp speed so MAKE SURE you get one.

Presales - $10 and will be available soon.

2) This is a LOCK-IN. As in....everyone MUST arrive with their ticket in 
hand by 11:30 pm to get in. The doors will shut at 11:30 and nobody else 
will be admitted, ticketed or not.

3) Because this isn't a bar, the party is BYOB. May I suggest a (small) 
cooler or a backpack of some sort? We don't want to clog the place with 
huge coolers, so keep it in something that can be tucked away please!

4) We will go as late as people want to stay and people want to DJ. That 
means at least 4am.

Get ready! We are ridiculously excited to be hosting such a legendary 
artist! This is one of only TWO gigs in the US along with the [kontrol] 
party in San Francisco @ The Endup. It is basically a house party in a 
badass music studio, with a small group of friends, on turbosound, with 
one of the residents of the most famous German techno club in the world 
. Tresor.

This will be one for the record books!

The address of the studios will be released before the party . it is 
centrally located right off Bigelow Blvd. Tickets available soon!

Sat May 09                      FOREVER YOUNG                       Toronto

The magic. The mystery. The music. There's nothing quite like raving. 
Every time you walk in the door, you're transported to a timeless land 
of peace, love, unity and respect; a place where the beat never stops 
and the wonders never cease; home away from home. You know how amazing 
it feels.

So do we.

We remember our first glimpse into the magical world that is raving. We 
remember the bracelets, the smiles, the hugs, the lasers, the music. And 
even though we've grown older, so long as we have raving in our lives, 
we never have to grow up.

On May 9th, join Nocturnal Commissions as we celebrate the wonder and 
magic of all things rave. Get out your brightest bracelets and your fun 
fur pants; bring along your old half-filled PLUR book; buy a new Vicks 
inhaler and a pair of glowsticks.

We are bright.

We are happy.

We are loving.

We are Toronto's Happy Hardcore ravers, and we are...

FOREVER YOUNG!

Featuring...

::Charles Feelgood::
Supacutz, myspace.com/charlesfeelgoodmusic
//funky shit-hard house-techno-electro
Legendary for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the 
Baltimore/Washington DC area, Charles Feelgood has built a reputation as 
a DJ in the international dance community through his ingenious remix 
skills and a dynamic brand of funky disco and hard house.

The consummated dance floor rocker, Feelgood sums up his musical mission 
in one sentence: "I just want to do what the name implies, to make 
people have a good time and go home with a great feeling."

He is sure to have you grinning from ear to ear so much it will make 
your face hurt. There is almost no way to stand still while this man is 
on the decks. His tunes will definitely have you feeling good (if not 
super awesome) the whole entire time.


::ramz::
District Ignition / Washington DC (First Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
//minimal-house-trace-and more...
Back in the days of the dinosaurs a caveman found music by beating two 
rocks together. After a major ice storm the caveman was frozen and his 
body was found in a glacier in the mountains. He was then taken to 
Washington, DC where he was left to thaw.

After regaining consciousness he learned to speak English and was given 
a name . Jason Ramsey. Jason soon drew musical inspiration from a very 
eclectic set of artists. Near the height of the nineties, he drew from 
this inspiration to establish himself as a dj in Washington, DC, taking 
on the moniker of .ramz..

More recently, Jason has developed his musical tastes from the tribal 
and progressive he was known for in the years of Buzz to a more refined 
taste which revolves around a combination of minimal, Swedish house and 
a small taste of trance when it's necessary. Jason has not only been 
invited to open the stage for dj's such as Gabriel & Dresden, George 
Acosta & BT but his mix series "Aural Fixation" has been in high demand 
across the country. That's a pretty good resume for a displaced 
homo-sapien from the Paleolithic era.

::DJ 2Rip::
District Ignition / Washington DC
//anything and everything
Some people filter through the music, purchasing music that is 
acceptable because everyone else is listening to it or because .it.s 
hot.. Then there are people who dig deep to find unique music that isn.t 
necessarily being sustained by pop culture. There are the people who 
absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking trends . forever on 
a quest to find the perfect record. DJ 2rip falls into the latter 
category.

He has made his mark over the course of a decade by hosting events 
around the mid-Atlantic, including abandoned apartment buildings and 
warehouse lofts to superclubs like Ibiza and Fur. With many ups and 
downs throughout his career his music has always been edgy and upfront. 
With that notion constantly in mind, DJ 2rip also maintains an ability 
to span several genres to create a unique musical journey.

He will fill your dancing shoes with pure awesomeness!!

::The Breakbeat Militia::
3x4 Clevr X Moose X Zone
breakbeatmilitia.com, Nexnap, djmoose.com Pittsburgh/Cleveland
//uhh...Breaks?

The name is synonymous with breakbeat perfection.

They have been mixing records since some of us were still in diapers and 
have so much skill between the 3 of them they could just spontaneously 
combust at any moment when they are on the decks. So watch out!! Even if 
they don't catch on fire, the dancefloor surely will, so make sure you 
wear flame retardant shoes!

::Eryn Evans::
B.A.D. Ass, Sinister Movement
//Bassline
You know her, you love her, you want to have 1000 babies with her, but 
she won't let you. Oh well, at least she will come out and blow you away 
with her bassline madness. Prepare your minds/bodies/souls for this 
earth shaking performance.

::abZ::
savoryaudio.com, FUZZ!
//Dubstep
According to an article in Pittsburgh's CP from 2007, AbZ was credited 
with bringing dubstep to Pittsburgh. He is a very skilled producer whose 
tracks are getting a lot of attention these days! Not to mention that he 
just recently started his own digital label (Savory Audio). His mixes 
are smooth and fresh and sure to make you get down and dirty.

::Nice Nate::
Flux Capacitor, B.A.D. Ass, Sunset til Sunrise, Glow
//Tech-electro
This up and coming PGH dj/producer is starting to blow up around these 
parts! Nice Nate will certainly make you feel very nice and sexy with 
his A++ track selection. No public masturbation allowed! This is all 
ages you know! Don't miss out on this up and coming PGH DJ!!!

Jun 11-14                GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL                Maryland

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air - truly, a magical event which has established itself as the 
annual summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes!

Currently in its eighth year, the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted 
the world's leading international talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the finest national and 
regional talent from the USA, becoming the premier destination for 
hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The gathering includes a 
full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, lectures and 
workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and much more at our 
spectacular, new location, Ramblewood!

www.GMSF.us / www.Gaian-Mind.com / www.Ramblewood.com
NEW LOCATION, NEW DATES

Presenting the 8th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009
Ramblewood, Darlington, Maryland, USA

We are happy to announce our new location - Ramblewood! Ramblewood is 
ideally located minutes from historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, and is 
convenient to Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and NYC. Unlike 
most places that do not understand or tolerate "alternative" groups, 
Ramblewood especially tries to cater to these groups which have a hard 
time finding a safe place to hold their events. Ramblewood understands 
and offers these groups a chance to meet in a beautiful natural 
environment, without fear of judgement or persecution.

Remember, GMSF2009 will be on the weekend before the summer solstice 
this year - Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009. We hope to 
reschedule the event on the summer solstice in the upcoming year...
EARLYBIRD TICKET SALES

Earlybird Tickets are ON SALE NOW - Wednesday, April 1st to Wednesday, 
April 8th, 2009! Please take advantage of this limited time to purchase 
event tickets at a reduced rate, plus accommodations and meal plans. Be

Samadhi is based in Asheville, North Carolina, a small,
sleepy town nestled between the woody slopes of the Appalachian
Mountains.
Behind the scenes, Asheville is home to one of the most
vibrant psytrance subcultures in America.
This wide-ranging
compilation showcases a stellar line-up of American psytrance
producers whose vibrations have been the source of countless smiles,
stomps, and sacred experiences for over a decade.
Expect to hear
sizzling leads and swampy grooves with a psychedelic edge; this is
music for all the wandering freaks and fairy folk of the magic forest!

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Canton, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Humanaut & Technoir Audio proudly present:

FRIDAY, MAY 1st, 2009

Stewart Walker {Live} [Persona Records - Tresor] Berlin
www.stewartwalker.com

Berlin-based STEWART WALKER is a restless innovator. After making a 
splash in the late nineties on definitive labels like Force Inc. and 
Tresor, he.s had an inestimable impact on the development of current 
club sounds, yet consistently chooses the less traveled road: working as 
live producer in a world of DJs; injecting emotion into functional 
electronic dance music; quietly building a label family of 
unclassifiable artists on his own imprint, Persona.

After selling his guitar in 1993, Walker began assembling a synth-based 
hardware studio while in university in Athens, GA. Inspired by Jeff 
Mills. Live at the Liquid Room he became obsessed with rhythm. A string 
of recordings appeared on Matrix Records in Detroit . including the 1997 
single Amphetamine Sulphate . and later on Deepfried (Grand Rapids, MI) 
and Tektite (Austin, TX). A year later, his first European release 
Artificial Music for Artificial People was picked up by Cristian Vogel's 
British imprint, Mosquito, and Walker hit the live circuit. Armed with 
only an AKAI MPC2000 sampler and a DJ mixer, he did what a DJ never 
could: move a club crowd with sounds shaped by his own hands. This 
original approach was welcomed across Europe and in Japan as well as his 
native US.

1999 saw Walker.s debut on Berlin.s Tresor Records with Nothing Produces 
Stark Imagery, followed up by the now-classic minimalist experiment, 
Stabiles, on Mille Plateaux. These productions proved to be seminal in 
the development of minimal techno.

Walker continued to release on labels such as Minus and Force Inc. 
until, in 2001, he set up his own imprint, Persona Records. Persona 
released eleven records in the US culminating in the second landmark 
album of Walker.s career to date: Live Extracts (2003). Live Extracts 
captured the sound and atmospherics of Walker.s in-club performances and 
was soon licensed by Tresor.

Persona restarted in 2005, this time in Berlin. Now based in Europe, 
Walker performed in every capital and made incursions as far afield as 
Australia and Russia. Soon after, he released the downtempo album 
Grounded in Existence and a breakbeaty techno EP, Travel Plaza. These 
releases showcased Walker.s increasing attention to nuance, dynamics, 
and melody.

Concentricity, Walker.s fourth full-length, was released in 2007.

Also featuring:

presale ticket. The party will be going down in the main recording 
studio of Machine Age. It only holds 170 people. That's it. Between 
Technoir Audio & Humanaut we are going to clear through these tickets at 
warp speed so MAKE SURE you get one.

Presales - $10 and will be available soon.

2) This is a LOCK-IN. As in....everyone MUST arrive with their ticket in 
hand by 11:30 pm to get in. The doors will shut at 11:30 and nobody else 
will be admitted, ticketed or not.

3) Because this isn't a bar, the party is BYOB. May I suggest a (small) 
cooler or a backpack of some sort? We don't want to clog the place with 
huge coolers, so keep it in something that can be tucked away please!

4) We will go as late as people want to stay and people want to DJ. That 
means at least 4am.

Get ready! We are ridiculously excited to be hosting such a legendary 
artist! This is one of only TWO gigs in the US along with the [kontrol] 
party in San Francisco @ The Endup. It is basically a house party in a 
badass music studio, with a small group of friends, on turbosound, with 
one of the residents of the most famous German techno club in the world 
. Tresor.

This will be one for the record books!

The address of the studios will be released before the party . it is 
centrally located right off Bigelow Blvd. Tickets available soon!

Sat May 09                      FOREVER YOUNG                       Toronto

The magic. The mystery. The music. There's nothing quite like raving. 
Every time you walk in the door, you're transported to a timeless land 
of peace, love, unity and respect; a place where the beat never stops 
and the wonders never cease; home away from home. You know how amazing 
it feels.

So do we.

We remember our first glimpse into the magical world that is raving. We 
remember the bracelets, the smiles, the hugs, the lasers, the music. And 
even though we've grown older, so long as we have raving in our lives, 
we never have to grow up.

On May 9th, join Nocturnal Commissions as we celebrate the wonder and 
magic of all things rave. Get out your brightest bracelets and your fun 
fur pants; bring along your old half-filled PLUR book; buy a new Vicks 
inhaler and a pair of glowsticks.

We are bright.

We are happy.

We are loving.

We are Toronto's Happy Hardcore ravers, and we are...

FOREVER YOUNG!

Featuring...

::Charles Feelgood::
Supacutz, myspace.com/charlesfeelgoodmusic
//funky shit-hard house-techno-electro
Legendary for his role in the birth of the electronic music scene in the 
Baltimore/Washington DC area, Charles Feelgood has built a reputation as 
a DJ in the international dance community through his ingenious remix 
skills and a dynamic brand of funky disco and hard house.

The consummated dance floor rocker, Feelgood sums up his musical mission 
in one sentence: "I just want to do what the name implies, to make 
people have a good time and go home with a great feeling."

He is sure to have you grinning from ear to ear so much it will make 
your face hurt. There is almost no way to stand still while this man is 
on the decks. His tunes will definitely have you feeling good (if not 
super awesome) the whole entire time.


::ramz::
District Ignition / Washington DC (First Pittsburgh Appearance!!!)
//minimal-house-trace-and more...
Back in the days of the dinosaurs a caveman found music by beating two 
rocks together. After a major ice storm the caveman was frozen and his 
body was found in a glacier in the mountains. He was then taken to 
Washington, DC where he was left to thaw.

After regaining consciousness he learned to speak English and was given 
a name . Jason Ramsey. Jason soon drew musical inspiration from a very 
eclectic set of artists. Near the height of the nineties, he drew from 
this inspiration to establish himself as a dj in Washington, DC, taking 
on the moniker of .ramz..

More recently, Jason has developed his musical tastes from the tribal 
and progressive he was known for in the years of Buzz to a more refined 
taste which revolves around a combination of minimal, Swedish house and 
a small taste of trance when it's necessary. Jason has not only been 
invited to open the stage for dj's such as Gabriel & Dresden, George 
Acosta & BT but his mix series "Aural Fixation" has been in high demand 
across the country. That's a pretty good resume for a displaced 
homo-sapien from the Paleolithic era.

::DJ 2Rip::
District Ignition / Washington DC
//anything and everything
Some people filter through the music, purchasing music that is 
acceptable because everyone else is listening to it or because .it.s 
hot.. Then there are people who dig deep to find unique music that isn.t 
necessarily being sustained by pop culture. There are the people who 
absorb music like a sponge; ignoring labels, bucking trends . forever on 
a quest to find the perfect record. DJ 2rip falls into the latter 
category.

He has made his mark over the course of a decade by hosting events 
around the mid-Atlantic, including abandoned apartment buildings and 
warehouse lofts to superclubs like Ibiza and Fur. With many ups and 
downs throughout his career his music has always been edgy and upfront. 
With that notion constantly in mind, DJ 2rip also maintains an ability 
to span several genres to create a unique musical journey.

He will fill your dancing shoes with pure awesomeness!!

::The Breakbeat Militia::
3x4 Clevr X Moose X Zone
breakbeatmilitia.com, Nexnap, djmoose.com Pittsburgh/Cleveland
//uhh...Breaks?

The name is synonymous with breakbeat perfection.

They have been mixing records since some of us were still in diapers and 
have so much skill between the 3 of them they could just spontaneously 
combust at any moment when they are on the decks. So watch out!! Even if 
they don't catch on fire, the dancefloor surely will, so make sure you 
wear flame retardant shoes!

::Eryn Evans::
B.A.D. Ass, Sinister Movement
//Bassline
You know her, you love her, you want to have 1000 babies with her, but 
she won't let you. Oh well, at least she will come out and blow you away 
with her bassline madness. Prepare your minds/bodies/souls for this 
earth shaking performance.

::abZ::
savoryaudio.com, FUZZ!
//Dubstep
According to an article in Pittsburgh's CP from 2007, AbZ was credited 
with bringing dubstep to Pittsburgh. He is a very skilled producer whose 
tracks are getting a lot of attention these days! Not to mention that he 
just recently started his own digital label (Savory Audio). His mixes 
are smooth and fresh and sure to make you get down and dirty.

::Nice Nate::
Flux Capacitor, B.A.D. Ass, Sunset til Sunrise, Glow
//Tech-electro
This up and coming PGH dj/producer is starting to blow up around these 
parts! Nice Nate will certainly make you feel very nice and sexy with 
his A++ track selection. No public masturbation allowed! This is all 
ages you know! Don't miss out on this up and coming PGH DJ!!!

Jun 11-14                GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL                Maryland

Join us for four days and three nights of Transcendental Dance in the 
open air - truly, a magical event which has established itself as the 
annual summer tradition for the global Trance Tribes!

Currently in its eighth year, the Gaian Mind Summer Festival has hosted 
the world's leading international talent from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, plus the finest national and 
regional talent from the USA, becoming the premier destination for 
hundreds of dancers from all over the world. The gathering includes a 
full weekend of spiritual dancing, tribal drumming, lectures and 
workshops, yoga, sweat lodge, swimming, relaxation, and much more at our 
spectacular, new location, Ramblewood!

www.GMSF.us / www.Gaian-Mind.com / www.Ramblewood.com
NEW LOCATION, NEW DATES

Presenting the 8th Annual
GAIAN MIND SUMMER FESTIVAL
Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009
Ramblewood, Darlington, Maryland, USA

We are happy to announce our new location - Ramblewood! Ramblewood is 
ideally located minutes from historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, and is 
convenient to Baltimore, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and NYC. Unlike 
most places that do not understand or tolerate "alternative" groups, 
Ramblewood especially tries to cater to these groups which have a hard 
time finding a safe place to hold their events. Ramblewood understands 
and offers these groups a chance to meet in a beautiful natural 
environment, without fear of judgement or persecution.

Remember, GMSF2009 will be on the weekend before the summer solstice 
this year - Thursday, June 11th to Sunday, June 14th, 2009. We hope to 
reschedule the event on the summer solstice in the upcoming year...
EARLYBIRD TICKET SALES

Earlybird Tickets are ON SALE NOW - Wednesday, April 1st to Wednesday,
