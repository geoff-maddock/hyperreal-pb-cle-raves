                       All About Scooby-Doo.

                         What We Remember:

Four teenagers and their trusted dog gallop across the country in their
purple and green van solving mysteries of all sort--and in the process
meet all kinds of interesting people.

                                                                       
                            The Truth:

Four high-school dropouts and their sentient dog ride around the
country in their psychedelic love machine, earning their way by selling
drugs. Oh, and they occasionally take some old guy's mask off to solve a
mystery,.. but even then, it starts to become apparent that those kids 
always seem to 'find' trouble.

It may be a little hard to swallow, but just take a look at the evidence:
Take Shaggy for example. Not only is he the inspiration for the current
'grunge' scene, with his sloppy dress and facial hair, but Shaggy is
obviously a 'burner', i.e., he smokes marijuana. Why do you think he is
constantly hungry? Shaggy can make a six foot hoagie and swallow it whole.

And then there is Scooby himself. While dogs do not generally smoke
joints, Scooby gets his 'high' from Scooby-Snacks, which are in fact
Hash-Brownies. Whenever Scooby, or Shaggy for that matter, eats a 
Scooby-Snack, they go ape!  It just blows their mind and they do whatever 
they are told, because they are so lit! Scooby is also hungry all the time.

The other characters do not actively take part in the stoner-fest that
Shaggy and Scooby do, but they do condone the selling of it because it
helps support their jaunts across the country (and the world--they
drove to China once). These other characters do have their own
peculiarities however...

Fred and Daphne are always splintering off from the group to go 'solve
the case' by themselves. It's no real mystery what these two are really
doing--they're getting busy in the back of the Mystery Machine.

Daphne with her pretty pink, well, legs and Fred are constantly bumping
uglies. Fred is, by the way, pumped up on steroids. One thing that
remains a mystery to me though, is why he always wore that stupid scarf
around his neck.

And what about Velma? Everyone's least favorite of the cast, was of
course, a lesbian. But, as it turned out in the later episodes, she was
also into bestiality. Where do you think Scrappy-Doo came from?
Scrappy, who was a dog yet spoke perfect english, was obviously a
product of Velma and Scooby.

So the kids spent their teenage years driving around the world,
slingin' dope, shooting steroids, eating hash brownies, and screwin'
their dog, while all the while looking for the perfect 'hit'.

Hi,

We are looking for a few people to help us with local promotion: flyering
events and making sure the cool stores have flyers.  In return you would get
a copy of all music we release, complimentary tickets to events in your area
of our artists.  Not alot I know since we have few releases and only one
artist who plays in the States regularly (Terry Mullan) but we will be
signing more - maybe you can find us some talent.

Look forward to your responses.

With respect,

Trace.
Airbag Records
97’ Releases: 
T Power - Waveform, 
Kumo - Kaminari, 
Terry Mullan - Mixed Not Stirred II.
98’ Releases: 	
Mr. C - Mixed Not Stirred III, 
Tony Justice - Mixed Not Stirred IV, 
Wintermute - Mixed Not Stirred V.

there was one slight mistake on this announcement -- the space can hold
a lot more than 300 people, i was going from the flyer for History.  

Sessions will be in a warehouse in the strip district, and can probably
fit around 600 people.  but come early anyway and get a mixtape.

Arg!!!!
This is why I hate being in stupid old Bloomington!!!  All the good stuff
happens when I'm here and nothing happens when I'm back in Pittsburgh!!  I
just want to scream.  Can anyone blame me for being bitter?!
	On a dissonant note, has anyone ever noticed the similaritiesbetween  
swing kids and ravers?

I didn't go, but according to the infoline their space didn't come through
so it ended up being split into a house party at Tyrel & Phil Dye's
houses.  Anyone go?

On the hardcore party - school has been killing me, so i havent even
talked to anyone else involved.  Don't worry though kids, I'm dedicated to
making this idea come through. stay tuned...

Well let's see... T-DAY was considerably downsized as on friday we lost
our space @ 3:30 in the afternoon. Me and a few of my partners were on the
phone from 3:30 on trying desperatley to find a space. We made the
deadline for 9pm but to no avail, our crew was unable to come up with
somthing in such short notice. The owner of said original space decided
that he'd talk to his lawyer and said that due to liability reasons we
could not have the space. I wasn't about to go and get liability insurance
for $700+ for a party whose budget was about that to begin with. So we had
to move it to Phil's house MUCH PROPZ and respect to Phil for letting us
use his crib. The people that were in attendence 150+ had an excellent
time at least that was the general concensus during the shindig. 

The ADK New Years is officially canceled unfortunatley... but oh well it
seems like everyone is jumpin' on the New Years bandwagon, so if you can't
find a party to go to you just haven't stepped out the door.

WHEN IS THE HARDCORE PARTY?

WE WANT HARD CORE - WE WANT HARD CORE!!!!

==============
can someone gimme the lineup for resolution in akron?

the best bet for nye *was* toronto, or so i thought...turns out that the city
that usually has it's shit together for nye is pretty messed up right
now...sky high won't actually be at the sky dome, rumors of derrick may
and rabbit in the moon not appearing, etc...the syrous/dose/renegade
event featuring l double, swift, and flux looks like it's going to be a
lackluster event....other toronto options include the e! network party,
which should have a great vibe, but i don't think personally i'd travel from
pittsburgh up for it...and the industry (big house club, think of a cross
b/w twilo and the church/trilogy/metropolis (for u old schoolers ;) 2 day
nye bash...

but fear not kids, hope may be just around the corner...;)

more info as it becomes available...


peace,
hossam

hope everyone makes it out for this one...

john e...you were right the first time...it's at the same space as
history...which according to andy's estimation will only hold about 400
ppl max...so get there early kids :) free mixtapes to the first 50...

imagine that...a fun, tight party in pgh...along the lines of sunshine kid's
deluxe...(the one with dante in that dope space)...what a crazy
concept...

a party thrown by ppl who know what up...and that definitely will not
end up being at tyrell and phils house....:)

Hey, did anyone tape that Spice Girls special last night on Fox? 

I should mention that it was VIKTOR MIZO who turned me on to the Spice
Girls.  Viktor tells me that he likes the athletic one, but I prefer the
blonde one myself.  She's nicer and kinder.  

Hey, Viktor, I just want to thank you once again for recommending that I
listen to the Spice Girls!  That well-used tape of yours that you sent me
is still in my car. I'm sure you want it back soon though because a day
without the Spice Girls is like a day without sunshine.

Your friend,

Braden

P.S. The above might actually be a pernicious attempt to playfully
embarrass Viktor Mizo. (But I would still like to see the Fox special if
you have a copy.)

HMMM...Spice Girls.  Well, I know a Spice Girl "Wannabe".  Her name is
Rebecca, she's blonde, and she's my 12 year old sister.  I could put you
in contact with her but anything beyond that might be illegal. ;)

Personally I like "sporty spice" the best too...she's got the thickest,
most akward accent of the them all.  Its pretty cool.

But seriously, did anyone hear the jungle remix of "Wannabe" that
aphrodite did for them?  That one will rinse out any party! ;)

This was quite a tv event.  I only caught some of it but I know it
included:

interviews with each of the spices
previews of their upcoming movie: SpiceWorld! (I am so there, just hope it
is nothing like WaterWorld)
A BRAND NEW music video
The words "Girl Power!" uttered about 5x a minute on average
Some spice history including thier former careers and the first name for
the group (Touch)
Probably much more that I missed

Not sure which spice I like the best, I'm pretty keen on all of them.
If anyone can find a tape of it, I'd love to see the rest of it too.

Peace,
JP

Nice one Braden.

Unfortunatelly, I didn't get to see the Spice Girls special either. I
missed it and I'm so "upset". I'd like a copy too, if someone has one.

As far as the tape is concerned, that's OK, you can still listen to it.
Actually, why don't you make a copy and pass it along to others too.
Spread the "Spice" around.

Cheers,
Viktor

i know this message, went through, coz veronica replied to it, but i never
saw it on pb-cle...and i usually do?

====

hi veronica (unless this is another veronica who happens to have the
same exact name as the one i know from back in the day in cleveland :)

funny story about this party:

the guy throwing it was talking to andy (sine) and andy told him that
there was a party called resolution thrown by lonnie fisher a few years
ago...and the guy was like who? should i know that name? and andy told
him that lonnie was the guy who threw the ultraworld parties...and the
guy was like what's ultraworld? andy said you know, bmore/dc
parties...since 91? and the guy had a blank stare...he said so what if
there's already been a party called resolution (which in theory i agree
with, but those of you who went to resolution know there probably
won't be another party like that ever again ;)

he went on to tell andy he was getting all these detroit djs for the party,
he said derrick may (booked in toronto that nite?) juan atkins, kevin
saunderson, oh yeah...and jeff mills...who last i heard, hasnt spun in
north america since the +8 halloween party in windsor a year or so
back...(sickness/recovery i think?)

btw...adam marshall won't be at this party, he is playing at the industry 2
day event in toronto for new years eve...if u have any questions, i can
give u the # of the promoter who has him booked+confirmed...

if it were me going to this party, i'd make sure i found out if everything
promised on the flyer (which is essentially a contract b/w the promoter
and the partygoer) will actually be delivered...$23 at the door isn't exactly
chump change...best of luck to the promoter and those who choose to
go.

wouldnt it be nice if we didn't have to leave our hometown for once? to
have a nice, tight ~400 person party full of vibe, good quality local
djs...under $20? maybe under $15?

hmmm....;)

questions? get back to me...


peace,
hossam


ps- i'd like to hear more info on this promoter (ie  track record/reliability) if
anyone has anything to add...

(i just called the infoline, and there's some changes, which i'll note on the
flyer below)

Titonton, Zacharia, Moahdeep, Tiko & Jason, Rob Riddum, Ground Zero, 
Zona, Dizzy, Elysuim, Pace, and a "special guest Hip Hop DJ".  The 
info-number is 330-290-5665.  I think it's supposed to cost $6.  The old 
event went from 10:00 P.M. until 3:00 A.M.  I don't know if the hours 
for this one are the same or not.  (Logically, it'll probably have to be 
longer unless each DJ is shuffled around about every 25 minutes.  I 
think there'll be only one "room" of music.)

     Furthermore, I'll take this opportunity to tell everyone about the 
other weekly event in Kent.  It's on Tuesday Nights at The Avenue, at 
the intersection of N. Water, Crain, and Lake Sts.  I don't know all the 
details for it, I've only actually been there once, but I do know that 
it costs $4 for those under 21 and either one or two dollars for those 
21 and over.  It features local DJs like the aforementioned Rob Riddum 
and a varying schedule of guests.

hi veronica (unless this is another veronica who happens to have the
same exact name as the one i know from back in the day in cleveland :)

funny story about this party:

the guy throwing it was talking to andy (sine) and andy told him that
there was a party called resolution thrown by lonnie fisher a few years
ago...and the guy was like who? should i know that name? and andy told
him that lonnie was the guy who threw the ultraworld parties...and the
guy was like what's ultraworld? andy said you know, bmore/dc
parties...since 91? and the guy had a blank stare...he said so what if
there's already been a party called resolution (which in theory i agree
with, but those of you who went to resolution know there probably
won't be another party like that ever again ;)

he went on to tell andy he was getting all these detroit djs for the party,
he said derrick may (booked in toronto that nite?) juan atkins, kevin
saunderson, oh yeah...and jeff mills...who last i heard, hasnt spun in
north america since the +8 halloween party in windsor a year or so
back...(sickness/recovery i think?)

btw...adam marshall won't be at this party, he is playing at the industry 2
day event in toronto for new years eve...if u have any questions, i can
give u the # of the promoter who has him booked+confirmed...

if it were me going to this party, i'd make sure i found out if everything
promised on the flyer (which is essentially a contract b/w the promoter
and the partygoer) will actually be delivered...$23 at the door isn't exactly
chump change...best of luck to the promoter and those who choose to
go.

wouldnt it be nice if we didn't have to leave our hometown for once? to
have a nice, tight ~400 person party full of vibe, good quality local
djs...under $20? maybe under $15?

hmmm....;)

questions? get back to me...


peace,
hossam


ps- i'd like to hear more info on this promoter (ie  track record/reliability) if
anyone has anything to add...

(i just called the infoline, and there's some changes, which i'll note on the
flyer below)

This is just my opionion, so if you don't agree that's ok , i'm not trying
to start a big battle here or anything.
Here it goes....

I'm kind of tired of seeing like 12- 14 djs on flyers, especially on flyers
for club events. To me it's basically pointless.
Being a dj for the last 8 years, I hate being told that my set will be 45
min to one hour. How can you "play" in that short amount of time.
When there are that many djs, time slots are always short. When a dj has a
short set, he is forced to play all the "slammin" tracks in his crate,
which may sound cool at first, but if you actually hear a dj "play" a full
set (2 - 2 1/2 hours or more )you will see the difference. When you give a
dj this amount of time, the dj has a chance to make a statement, to take
you  on a journey. Bring the crowd to peaks, and drop them into valleys.
That is what djing is all about. Basically anybody can learn to match
beats, and play a few records. But only a few people can become "Djs".
These Djs can feel the crowd, can hold back the climax of music untill just
the right moment, and then wham.... destroy the floor. And to do this a one
hour set is not enough!

So if I made any sense promoters, lets stop booking 250000 dj's and book
just enough to let each have a 1 1/2 to 2 hour set.
Believe me, when you hear what starts happening, the quanity won't matter
any more, the quality of what you will be hearing will make up for it 1000
times over.

please think this over, if you don't agree- well cool- after all it's just
my opinion.
Thanks, peace & respects,
Sleepy C

I agree with this in theory, but take a look at what happened when Derrick
May came to Cleveland a short time ago.  He was billed as the only dj, and
practically no one came.  Granted, there was a great party the night
before (yours), but there are always close substitutes these days.
Derrick May is a *huge* name and at least locally, it was very well
promoted.  So what went wrong?  I feel a lot had to do with the idea of
spending all that money on a single name.  When there is an entire line-up
of quality, there is more of a reason to attend.  So, I agree that 12 is
too many, but the converse seems to cause troubles too.

=====

i want to make things clear. my post regarding steve was sarcastic. he
and i are friends and i greatly respect and appreciate everything he's
done over the past 4 years that i've known him.

rob, u need to be a little more civil and at least willing to LET PEOPLE
SPEAK THEIR OWN OPINIONS. 

attacking a person for voicing their opinions will only lead to a circular
argument...for example, i could call you a stupid, no brained dumbfuck for
your attack on steve's opinion, but where would that get us?

grow up.

This really makes me excited taht you all are inganging in critically
analizing your arguments.  I am not talking about youir disagreeing
discussion I am talkinga obut your reasons and conclusions.  I am glad you
all wise enought to know that name calling and circular reasoning is not
good reaoning and has basis to be taken as anyone elses reasoning.

Listen here mister "I brought house music to Cleveland"
We are not the only promoters in Cleveland. There are at least 15 other
promoters here as well. Oh wait, todays thursday, make that 16 other
promoters.
But seriously, what about the thursday thingie at the phantsy, by "butter
something or other" productions. They got it goin' on every thursday.

Just because you were the one to spin house back in the days of the
aqualon/lift, the nine of clubs and the tidal rave parties, dosn't give you
the right to be Mr. shut the fuck up.... The fact is most of the people
going out now don't even know what those events/clubs were, they were 8
back then. So you can be the one to Sit The FUCK down!!

PEACE (!!) LOVE (!!) UNITY(!!) and RESPECT(!!!!?)

I would just like to thank all who participated in the 'too-many-djs
snipe'.  It provided me with much needed amusement when I came home from a
very dismal day.  Who needs "All My Children" and "One Life to Live" when
you can just hook up a computer and read pb-cle-raves posts?!  
Seriously though, if one's going to call their post an article of sarcasm,
they really should make it more evident.  One is unable to interpret the
appropriate rise and fall of vocal sarcasm over the silent, black and
white (or green and black) computer screen.  Just a thought from your
Foulmood girl out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere.  =)

Ignoring all the other pointless mail on this, I have to agree with you
Steve - too many events try to stuff in too many djs just to make their
party seem more impressive.  Luckily this doesn't happen in pgh, but i
think that's more from the fact that we don't have that many promoters.

I think 1.5 hours is about right for a dj set, with 6 djs per night, a 9
hour event 10pm-7am.  That's a good to me.  Of course, it also depends on
the style and the djs skill.  For example, more epic trancy stuff should
have longer sets, while hardcore licks probably do better with shorter
sets.  But its all relative the the particular djs i guess.

As far as a club night, i cant realistically see more than 5 djs play in
one night...although there were some good 168 events with about 8-10
djs...so really it can depend.

Ahh...the good old nights of 168.  Whatever happened to it?  Are there
still events there?  Has it closed?  I have a lot of fond and not so fond
memories of that place when and before it was 168.  Remember Club Joy?
Where do the years go? Ho-Hum. :(

As far as I know 168 is only hip-hop now, but i don't know how much biz it
gets.  The last party i went to there was The Nothing, but i think that
was just a one-off thing.  I never really like 168 that much, but the more
i think back on it, i have to give them major props for haveing so many
quality events week after week, including the original steel city,
the protokultures, T-1000 with star wars playing backwards in the
background, your 2nd ago....i never thought id miss it, but i do.

I went to 168 on my visit home a few weeks ago.  Its all hip-hop and
reggae, but its sooooo ghetto!  I was afraid- even though I did fit in. If
you like totally ghetto, hardcore, down and dirty hip hop and reggae, go
to 168!

i like short sets with lots of djs when the djs only play one type of
music, and they're set don't change in style.

but i'd much rather have a 2 hour set with a dj who goes from one
type of music to another and actually makes it a "voyage", to use
a cliched dj term...

stagnation sucks.

i don't know about this one.  i think that if the dj is good enough, i
could see blowing some money for just one name. 
i would have come up for that if i didn't have to work.  but i think
admission prices are in general becoming insane.  i remember like two
years ago i could drop 20 bucks and catch 3 days of nonstop acts.  now,
some of these one night events are ridiculous.  30-35 bucks for one night
seems unreasonable to me, i don't care how many djs you have spinning.

i agree.  some of the bests sets i have seen (at family affair and
natural) were like 3 hours long.  i can't see how a dj has time enough to
work the crowd in like 45 minutes.  if it were someone doing a live act
and not spinning, i might beable to understand so small of a time.  it's
the quality of djs that makes or breaks events for me, not the number. 
i've been to parties with like 2 djs spinning in the couse of the night
and they've been better (vibewise) than some of 6-7-8 djs or more
parties.  Plus, when you only get to hear 45 minutes of a djs set, the dj
deosn't get much of a chance to establish him/herself and ends up
sounding like most every other dj you've ever heard.

my thoughts on the whole derrick may situation:

first of all, the price was not listed on the voicemail, so i doubt anyone
assumed that it was going to be twenty dollars or more (although it was).
i do believe that partially, the low turn out had to do with the fact that
the fall classic was the night before, although i am not sure how good of
a reason that is considering it was not terribly expensive (in comparison to
the cost of parties today) and it was also on a friday night.

the reason that i do believe no one showed up for derrick may is simply because
people just don't know who he is anymore. just as our list wiseman hossam
pointed out in a post today about the promoters who are throwing the nye
party in cleve/akron (resolution), they had no idea who lonnie or
ultraworld are, the
majority of the ravers who used to know who derrick may is have turned
over and moved out or away from the scene. i think it is mainly about
ignorance. i would bet my bottom dollar that MOST of the people who were at
derrick may went _specifically_ to hear him. hence, the low turn out.

that's just my opinion though,

last i heard, jeff mills is playing at the universe party here in london
on new years eve.  not that bmore/dc is the center of the world, but any
promoter that has never heard of ultraworld and is trying to throw a big
new years party is just dumb.  and, like hossam says, there wont be
another "resolution" like the one a few years back, which had to be one
of the wickedest parties known to man! hee hee.

phatom 45 is coming to STJ! im pretty siked. for some reason i guess
bulletproof is in on this too.  i heard this was the last STJ ever.. true?
====

YES phantom is coming to SCJ (SteelCityJungle) on tues, dec 16...

the reason nick (bulletproof) is in on this is b/c they support the jungle
scene in pgh, and are helping us bring him in...also, phantom has put
tapes out thru bulletproof (anyone got his dusted fader/drop top caddy
tape that bulletproof put out?)

NO this isn't the last scj ever, in fact the next one is on tues dec. 30 with
special guest dj jeffee from orlando hitting the decks...

we're gonna continue well into 98 bringing you the best consistent night
out pittsburgh has seen in years...

no, we're not moving the space to soba, either...

we've refocused our efforts and plan on revitalizing the jungle scene as
best we can...and exposing as many new ppl to the sound as we can in
the months ahead...

we would love to hear any comments, criticisms, etc. let us know if
there's any djs that youd like to hear that we could bring in, we also plan
on having a battle of the djs early next year...:)

please feel free to drop me a line until we get the steelcity email address
up and running...thanks.

i agree with kate...

braden, you know your music...i understand u had to work, but 'blowing
money' 'if the dj is good enuff' to see derrick may, even if he is just *one*
dj, he's kind of the best in the world in my opinion :) you may not like
flawlessly mixed, 2+ hr sets w/perfect track selection ...

he's rocked me that hard. 

going on...

>>> Kate Catanese <kate@topsecret.net> 12/05/97 03:33am >>>
first of all, the price was not listed on the voicemail, so i doubt anyone
assumed that it was going to be twenty dollars or more (although it
was).

[that's kinda crazy tho, i can't imagine what expenses the club must have
had to charge $20 at the door...even if u only plan on 200 ppl showing
up? at a club, with installed sound and lights, your budget won't be
$4000 to bring in derrick, unless his fee has nearly tripled since i booked
him last year. (the party didn't happen tho)]

the reason that i do believe no one showed up for derrick may is simply
because people just don't know who he is anymore. just as our list
wiseman hossam pointed out in a post today about the promoters who
are throwing the nye party in cleve/akron (resolution), they had no idea
who lonnie or ultraworld are, the majority of the ravers who used to
know who derrick may is have turned over and moved out or away from
the scene. i think it is mainly about ignorance. i would bet my bottom
dollar that MOST of the people who were at derrick may went
_specifically_ to hear him. hence, the low turn out.

[i really can't (don't want to maybe ;) believe that ppl don't know who
derrick may is, esp. in this area of the country, with house music being
as popular as it is...it's not even a 'knowing your roots' kinda thing, b/c i
think derrick may and his music is still relevant to our scene.

derrick may and renegade soundwave played metropol in pgh back in
1989...i would have loved to have seen that show.

i don't want to be a wiseman, i still go to parties and freak out the same
as i have done for years now...what scares me is that if *i'm* a
wiseman, what are the dumbasses like out there? i can't fault you for not
knowing everything about parties and music when u first start going
out...but it bothers/astounds me that ppl don't care...that they don't even
have any curiosity as to where this all came from, how it got to where it
is now...i try not to think about how shallow and one-dimensional some
kids who go to parties are...i tend not to have too much in common with
them...is it they don't know the history, or that they don't care to know?]

Should be a great one...as far as I know this isn't the last one: where
did you hear that?   I think hossam said there's going to be one on the
30th featuring Jeffee from Florida, so there's at least one more.   The
only reason I could see to stop steel city was to get a better space or
day of the week...at the very least they should do it on a monthly basis
with more promotion...

In fact, why doesn't someone start up a monthly event featuring jungle and
hardcore?  I'd give them lots of presents and do their homework for a
year.  Just a thought.

Rob Sherwood is a legend, that's for sure.  He probably has done as much
for "setting the stage" as anyone.  Angela owned the vehicle, but Rob
drove it in the race.  And he drove it well!  Besides, what the hell else
was there to do on a Wednesday night in 1990/91/92/93/94? 

But I'm not one to hang on to the past because for me, things just keep
getting better and better and better.

FYI: I tried to go to 168 last Saturday nite.  We thought it would be 
somekind of old school hip-hop night.  Wrong!  The time was 10:45pm and 
there were about 5 people inside sitting along the side listening to 
100% pure regge (sp?).  The guy at the door tried to tell us it was 
Reggee/Hip-Hop nite but we weren't going to take our chances.  Oh yeah, 
the parking attendant at one of the fine city lots didn't give me my 
money back despite the fact that we were parked there a total of about 6 
minutes.  

Oh...if someone could help me with the spelling of reggee I would 
appreciate it.

I've been chewing on this for a few weeks and wanted some input from
both promoters and attendees alike:

Instead of the model of "pay at the door" where the promoter has to knaw
his/her fingernails most of the night, facing the realistic fear of not
breaking even and causing undue stress, what about a scenario where it's
80-100% pay in advance?  Now, I would never suggest using a Ticketmaster
style set up, but what if a party was really limited to 300 or 400
tickets, wouldn't this be a far wiser way of managing the risk?  It would
also allow the promoter to actually enjoy his/her own party without having
to keep one eye on the money the whole night.

With virtually all parties, the promoter tells his/her audience that there
is a "limited capacity" with the hopes of driving them to the doors early. 
But most party goers know that it's just a come-on.  But what if the
promoter started something like 4 months before the event and said "all
tickets must be purchased in advance" and "there are only 350 tickets
available"?  Then, with subsequent flyers as the date approaches, there
can be a "only 79 tickets left" tag.  Do you think that this would work? 
It seems to have more potential with really huge acts of the Juan Atkins,
Richie Hawtin, Derrick May order.  If this has been tried effectively, I
would like to know about it. 

I had heard of a party in Toronto where this was done -- and the entrance
ticket was a piece to a puzzle.  When the attendee arrived, (s)he handed
her/his ticket to a person who put the puzzle together during the night. 
I think this sort of creativity is also pretty fantastic and adds to the
allure of pre-purchasing tickets. 

Perhaps there will be a lag time where people show up to a promoter's
party and try to get in, only to find out that the "pay in advance" policy
was actually enforced.  But once the word gets out, there might be a rush
to buy tickets for the next special event.  Going back to creativity, the
better the event, the more demand there will be to attend the next time.

I think limiting supply as a promoting technique has been too often
ignored.  It ultimately takes the financial risk off the back of the
promoter so he/she can focus on making a great time for all.

So, what do you think?

Braden

To all of my fellow ravers/students.  
			Jenifer Foulmood

> Finals  Poem:
> 
> Twas the night before finals,
> And all through the college,
> The students were praying
> For last minute knowledge.
> Most were quite sleepy,
> But none touched their beds,
> While visions of essays
> Danced in their heads
> Out in the taverns,
> A few were still drinking,
> And hoping that liquor
> Would loosen up their thinking.
> In my own room,
> I had been pacing,
> And dreading exams
> I soon would be facing.
> My roommate was speechless,
> Her nose in her books,
> And my comments to her
> drew unfriendly looks.
> I drained all the coffee,
> And brewed a new pot,
> No longer caring that my nerves were shot.
> I stared at my notes,
> But my thoughts were muddy,
> My eyes went ablur,
> I just couldn't study.
> "Some pizza might help,"
> i said with a shiver,
> But each place I called
> Refused to deliver.
> I'd nearly concluded
> That life was too cruel,
> With futures depending
> On grades had in school.
> When all of a sudden,
> our door opened wide,
> And Patron Saint Put-It-Off
> Ambled inside.
> His spirit was careless,
> His manner was mellow,
> All of a sudden,
> He started to bellow.
> "ON Cliff notes, on Crib Notes
> On last year Exams.
> On Wingit and Slingit
> And Last Minute Crams."
> His message delivered
> he vanished from sight.
> But we heard him laughing
> Outside in the night.
> Your teachers have pegged you
> So just do your best.
> Happy Finals to All
> And to all a Good Test.

Well, you know, that would be really great, but unfortunately opera
schools rated best in the whole country don't just grown on that tree down
the street.  My field is extremely specialized and going to the best
school should help me find a paying job later on.  Besides, I find no
fault in the school itself, only the location.  Anyways if you're tired of
hearing me gripe, maybe you should just delete every message that has my
name on it.

hi veronica (unless this is another veronica who happens to have the
same exact name as the one i know from back in the day in cleveland :)

funny story about this party:

the guy throwing it was talking to andy (sine) and andy told him that
there was a party called resolution thrown by lonnie fisher a few years
ago...and the guy was like who? should i know that name? and andy told
him that lonnie was the guy who threw the ultraworld parties...and the
guy was like what's ultraworld? andy said you know, bmore/dc
parties...since 91? and the guy had a blank stare...he said so what if
there's already been a party called resolution (which in theory i agree
with, but those of you who went to resolution know there probably
won't be another party like that ever again ;)

he went on to tell andy he was getting all these detroit djs for the =
party,
he said derrick may (booked in toronto that nite?) juan atkins, kevin
saunderson, oh yeah...and jeff mills...who last i heard, hasnt spun in
north america since the +8 halloween party in windsor a year or so
back...(sickness/recovery i think?)

btw...adam marshall won't be at this party, he is playing at the =
industry 2
day event in toronto for new years eve...if u have any questions, i can
give u the # of the promoter who has him booked+confirmed...

if it were me going to this party, i'd make sure i found out if =
everything
promised on the flyer (which is essentially a contract b/w the promoter
and the partygoer) will actually be delivered...$23 at the door isn't =
exactly
chump change...best of luck to the promoter and those who choose to
go.

wouldnt it be nice if we didn't have to leave our hometown for once? to
have a nice, tight ~400 person party full of vibe, good quality local
djs...under $20? maybe under $15?

hmmm....;)

questions? get back to me...


peace,
hossam


ps- i'd like to hear more info on this promoter (ie  track =
record/reliability) if
anyone has anything to add...

no. the simple fact that your first sentence answers your last one, at
least to me.
most ravekids, like you said, know that theyre hyping up the 350 tickets as
a way to increase the appeal. we are all used to this, and we look past it.
we judge by their other parties and their lineup that it is worth going to
and we go to it and we usually dont buy any advance tickets. hardly ever,
except for really big special events.

with big special events, such as Park Rave Madness on New Years, the type
of party that will be  overly crowded, oversold, and well promoted,  the
tickets were $30 in october and even then kids were complaining about the
party being $50. It wouldve been $30 if they got off theyre butt and got
one. this type of shit is so typical in the scene. its so easy to talk
about events coming up but when it comes down to it, you aint gonna know if
you really gonna go until the day before or the day of. becuase of this i
bet that the rave on New Years will still get more of its gross income at
the door, even tho it was $20 cheaper two months ago.

so you cant change the fact that youre always gonna have to worry about
money at the door and the night of the event. but you hire people that you
trust to do that for you so you can go around and have fun and thank
everyone for coming. i think one rule of thumb about promoting should be
that you sell all of your drugs before the party so you dont have to worry
about that the night of your own party, and you sell them to people who
will come to your party, respect you, and not have any problem with paying
their entrance fee. i dont sell drugs so i am not an expert on this, but
thats what the word is, logically.

Excellent!  A battle sounds wicked!  I'v been thinking of a similar idea
for a while - short sets, elimination rounds, djs pullin' out all the
tricks and stops, and of course, judgement by the crowd. :)

Some djs I'd like to hear:
Any UK djs if you can get them, Everfresh (Toronto), RAW (LA), Curios
(LA), KRISPE (Oklahoma i think), KPAKPO (philly)...other's too: the more
variety the better.

Some djs I'd like to see back again: J Smooth (my fav dj of the moment),
Karl K (last set was impressive), Tik Tak...hey it would be cool to see
them ex-patriots Farmer Tea and Starchild back once again, if they haven't
forgotten us.. ;)

Also: no dis to you Hossam, but I'd like to see more MCs take the mic, at
least as an experiment.  It seems to be an element of jungle kulture that
isn't really played up much...maybe its coz we don't have any?

thats it.

variety is cool,  but don't worry about bringing jungle

So would that be along the lines of "my train of thought just jumped the
track and killed several orphans and a nun"?

> What in god's name does "What the dilly yO!" mean
> and have you ever heard someone say it?

	I actually have heard people say that, um, quote and I think it means,
basically, what's up or perhaps, what the hell are you doing.  I can't be
sure.  I think that a consortium of ravers should compile a "raver"
dictionary full of slang and action meanings.  Wouldn't that be cool?  And
maybe a raver survivor guide.  Of course this would have to be free of
charge because I've never know a raver to pay for anything like that,
unless of course, they're a drug dealer and then they don't need to pay
for it because they can get it through shady means.  
	I once knew this boy from Brooklyn who for some reason was 
relocated here.  I never could find out why.  I went to IT with him and
some other people.  Imagine spending an entire weekend with a boy who
starts and ends every sentence that comes out of his mouth with YO.
Luckily he was in some chemical daze on the way home and didn't say too
much.  Needless to say, that was not one of my favorite road trips.  
	I just don't understand the use of slang in the rave culture.  Oh
sure, I guess it's coo-ol or something but really now.  Personally, I'm
much more impressed by someone who can form a complete and grammatically
correct sentence with some substance of subject.  These stupid little drug
head raver chics that stumble around with a dazed look who can't string
together simple subject/predicate sentence strike me as unintelligent
boobs.  Personal opinion of course.  
	I believe many ravers will be the leaders of tomorrow.  They are our
scientists, artists, doctors, politicians, teachers, and so on.  I do know
many incredibly talented and intelligent ravers, but some leave me shaking
my head in amazement.  I guess you have a few in every group.  Please
don't mistake me.  I'm not griping.  These are only observations.  
	This scene has given me more in two years than our conventional
society had given me in the 16 years previous to my discovery.  We can
debate the smaller inner workings of our previously underground
and presently emerging society, but on the whole it gives the love and
support that is lacking from what some call "the real world".  Regardless
of the politics in the rave scene, there is a real sense of community and
acceptance that I find lacking in other areas of society.

Peace, Love, Unity, Respect
Jenifer

First off i would like to welcome mr. Rob Sherwood (aka
Color Blind and Tone Deaf Productions) to the list, as Braden
 has already pointed out the man is a legend...the Nine of clubs, 
Smart Bar/the Lift, Tidal Rave...those were the nights out that
really kicked it off for me back in the day...

But as Hossam & Dawn has pointed out, there's a certain degree
of netiquette that must be acquired...specifically the 
utilization of 'smileys', such as...  :)  ;)   8)  =)  =]  ;P 
to signify humor/sarcasm of posts...this along with the
maintenance of the PLUR standard are most probably the
two biggest things to familiarize yourself with on the rave
lists...

Concerning Kate's point about the lack of turn out for Derrick 
May, I found it very ironic because i just very recently had a 
discussion with Rob (the other Rob, Rob Rage, here in Columbus) 
and he had mentioned if there was one DJ that is not getting 
enough respect from the new generation, it would be Derrick May, 
he is after all one of the inventors of the Techno sound as we know 
it today...

Another parallel was when we were both reminiscing the lack
of a turn out from when Juan Atkins was spinning at Family Affair I
because most of the people were watching Dub Tribe...

It's exactly as the infamous Thome Thomato (the founding father
of the Cincinnati scene) said when I bumped into him at the same
party...Kids don't care about what you've done in the past, it's
what have you done for me lately...

tee hee, i go to partys now and prolly only a handful (usually the
promotors and the dj's) know how long i've been involved in the scene...

;)

Jenifer,

Opera school...that's pretty cool...much respect!  Oh..and I'm not tired 
or hearing you gripe, because I graduate in about a week and then I go 
back to the middle of "bumfuck nowhere," so I know what you are going 
through.  I hope to find work in the heart of D.C. so I can then become 
"The Corporate Raver."  

later, troy.

i can't believe that people don't know who derrick may is either, that
just doesn't seem possible.  even before i started getting into the
scene, back when all i did was listen to the music in my room, i knew who
he was just because so many of the artists/groups/acts i listened to
credited him as one of their biggest influences.  anyone who reads the
fine print on the covers of cds/vinyls should have some idea who he is. 
i can't help but find out as much information as possible about what i
like.  but even so, i agree with you that derrick may's music still is
relevent.  he was an innovator, and still is.

>derrick may and renegade soundwave played metropol in pgh back in
>1989...i would have loved to have seen that show.

wow.  it seems like most of the really kick ass shit occured way before i
ever heard of it.  i was just listining to 'in dub' the other day.  it's
amazing how old stuff still can fuck your mind, better than it ever did
before.  i would have loved to have seen meat beat manifesto back in '89.
 only problem, i think i was listening to like mc hammer back then.

believe me, i love 'blowing money' esspecially on a kick ass event (and

still kicking myself for not finding a way off work.

mad props.  i agree with you totally.  i know that i don't know
everything there is to know, and in my own ways, i am still pretty
un-experienced.  but the thing is, i want to know everything there is.  i
don't think you can let something into your life and not know jack about
it, knowwhatimean?  i mean, most people can do something so simple as get
on the web, type in www.hyperreal.org and click on the alt.rave.faq link.
 that dosen't take any effort at all.  i just think some people are lazy
and don't want to spend the minutes to read a little history.

i was wondering if any central ohio list members caught the front page of
the columbus dispatch saturday (today).
"Music-filled 'raves' become the latest rage"
for articles about 'raves'.. i felt that this one was less stereotypical
than most.. and in ways.. even positive. in lieu of typing it out, i'll
leave with:
       "But the majority of the new crop of ravers today aren't drawn to
them (raves) because of drugs like Ecstacy, a methamphetamine that was the
catalyst for the movement in Britain.
        Instead, it's the music."

if someone cares enough and doesn't get the dispatch.. i'll type the article
out and send it.
yes, boredom.

I'd really like to read about it.  There hasn't really been a lot of good
press on raves lately but I have seen good articles.  I know it sounds a
bit silly but I read an article in a magazine for "Mother"s (that's what
it's called).  She likened raving to spirituality and religion.  It was a
really great article and if I can find it, I type it in.  Ooh Ooh a long
e-mail.  Anyway rave on.

     In case I accidentally started the "too many DJs" argument (I'm not 
sure I did.  It may have developed extraneous to my posting.) by listing 
all the ones that were supposed to make an appearance Thursday in Kent 
and jocularly hypothesizing that "they would have to be shuffled off and 
on about every 25 minutes" for them all to perform within 5 hours time, 
(since, purportedly, there was to be only one "room" of music) I should 
correct my mistake.  There were indeed TWO "rooms" which, by the way, I 
think can detract from a show.  If, at any given point, one is trying to 
listen to a performer who utilizes dynamics in his music, that is to say 
sometimes his music becomes relatively quiet, one inevitably hears music 
coming from another room. One's attention is arrested by what assaults 
the ears the loudest.  Thus, one is taken away from the world the 
"dynamic" DJ is trying to create at any time his music does indeed 
become quieter.  But, anyhow, Titonton was awesome.  
     In relation to the scepticism surrounding the integrity and quality 
of the promoters of "Resolution", from my own observations Thursday, I 
think it's justified.  A group of people who I could tell weren't into 
the scene at all were passing out flyers for it.  I could see them 
thinking, "Man, we can really use this shitty-ass music to suck dry 
these little misled middle class kids."

Speaking of bad weather....what the hell is up with Pittsburgh, ice and 
snow, and raves.  I didn't make it up to Sessions either due to bad 
road conditions and my rear-wheel drive car.  Same thing happened a 
couple weeks ago with the Eastland Mall event!  My time is running short. 
Is there anything going on next weekend?

A little fun:

The "How Sexy Are Your Sounds" article by Sara Finlayson reads:

Music Style--HOUSE
Audience:  Platinum American Express cocaine crowd.
Attire: Sophisticated gals in tight-fitting black lycra and open-shirted
fellows sporting gold medallions. Also big among the gay community where
shirts are usually off.
Motions:  Bumping and grinding. Always sweaty.
Sex Status:  Everyone likes to "do it" here. A veritable meat market.
Get Laid?: 10 outta 10

Music Style--JUNGLE/D&B
Audience:  Fed-up ex-ravers and hyperactive Hip-Hop heads. Relatively young,
more popular with girls than most forms of electronic music.
Attire:  Hip-Hop meets rave goes for a skate and then joins the Army.
Motions:  Flipper-like motions of the hands with a few moves collected from
watching Beat Street.  Circle dancer meets MC Hammer.
Sex Status:  Jungle, like other forms of bass-heavy music, is very sexy.
Get Laid?:  6 outta 10

Music Style--TECHNO
Audience: Dudes who've been in the rave scene way too long.
Attire:  What I came in.
Motions:  Leaning against the wall discussing why Techno is superior to every
other form of music on the planet.
Sex Status:  Too busy talking about Techno to notice.
Get Laid?:  3 otta 10

Music Style--HARDCORE/GABBER
Audience:  Tweeked out teens.  Predominantly frustrated males.  Also popular
with serial killers.
Attire:  Multiple piercings, wife-beater shirts, baggy trousers, and short
hair.
Motions:  Vigorous jumping up and down, pogo'ing, and speaker fucking.
Sex Staus:  Stuck midway through adolescent masturbatory phase.  Anxious and
feverish dance style suggests an urgent need to get laid.
Get Laid?:  0 outta 10 (only a mother could love these guys)

Music Style--GOA/PSYCH TRANCE
Audience:  Crusties and anti-establishment trust fund babies
Attire:  Matted dreadlocks, tie dye, and sandals remain popular.  A faint
whiff of Nag Champa is usually evident.
Motions:  Hippie dance style reminiscent of '60s exploitation movies. Crazy
arms motions and rubbery legs usually point to excessive LSD intake.
Sex Status:  Attractive to each other. Hose down before use.
Get Laid?:  Depends on the phase of the Moon.

Music Style--PROGRESSIVE HOUSE/TRANCE
Audience:  University students and candy ravers.
Attire:  'E' friendly apparel, including fluffy backpacks, glitter,
pacifiers, and anything resembling a Dr.Suess character.
Motions:  Hands in the air.  Eyes rolling back.  Occasionally slumped against
the wall.
Sex Status:  No thanks...we're in it for the music. Hugs welcome.
Get Laid?: Males: 2 outta 10 (too busy trainspotting), Females: 6 outta 10
(they look great...to dirty old men)

Subject: {pb-cle} thoughts on history; unabridged
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

new theories of science dictate that the evolution of anything is not as
much linked with its particular history but the evolution of a basic form
of "archetypal" dispatch between the fundamental material progressions of
very small particles and the fundamental phychological progressions of very
simple concepts.

essence -[Immanuel Kant] - the inner-structure of things.

particle physics has become very strange. 10 years ago, if someone said
this they would assume i am a particle physicist. these days we are
fortunate to have with us a variety of 'translators' who can understand the
'theology' of what is happening to those scientists who shape our
intellectual opinions about what makes us us, on the material side.

particle physics has a knack for seeing all of the world as made of the
same physical "stuff"
  (stick with me, this is enchanting)
     if we can see how this stuff is actually communicating to each other
        as a pure definition of the word instantaneous,  we run into the
wall that einstein built with relativity and the actual speed of light. you
would think that they were building upon einstiens principles, but no, they
now recognize him for his ethics; not his physics.  new quantum logic
assumes that everything in the world is made up of the same stuff and acts
according to the same laws governing this stuff not as a action or
reaction, but as if every particle "knows" what it is it is supposed to be
doing.

this sounds absurdly uncomplex and dogmatic if you ask me. however, they
have faith in these concepts which require more than actualized knowledge.
Janana (experimental) Yoga in Buddhism has two parts to it, and like the
new physics, they make a seperation of the actual and the real. the
'actual' knowledge is the knowledge of something and the 'real' knowledge
is the knowledge of experiencing that something. both practices approach
the realized knowledge as having more meaning.

so when i say that the word "real" means "experienced" i must be making
some mistake. how do we have such a link to what is real and what has
already happened, and still believe that the "actualized" knowledge i
recieve about Jesus, my great grandfather, and Hitler makes not as much
difference as knowing that i took a shower this morning. this is the
problem with the Krisnas. their paradox is that they tell us that the
longer that something may affect us, the more powerful the effect is.
(thats why they believe in a religion formed 5000 years ago) Yet seemingly
mystical, makes too much sense to make a religion from it. a successful
religion requires a correct balance of mystery and method.

there are very simple and seemingly unnconnected occurences that make
history what it is. this does not mean they are unnconnected. it does mean
that all of history can be understood in just one moment. this is true in
quantum physics, but untrue in history class.

in short, to comprehend the emergence of the rave scene is to comprehend
the emergence of a photon. the only problem occurs when we cannot see what
the photon is made up of. we know how to see it as a particle and we can
understand how to see it as a wave. this does not explain why it is here
nor how it got here. we reckon it got here with a certain speed of 186000
miles/second. and the more we contemplate on how it got here, the more we
forget about what we were supposed to be doing.

 we all have a task for us. let us not be narcissistic of our ancestors who
have done both good and bad, but follow in the footsteps of our own
understandings. what you understand is more than actual; it is real. what
everyone else will tell you is not as real. once we realize this, it is
made for us a path unto which we do what is meant for us to do.

Just curious... does anyone know, as of right now, who is NOT going to be
performing/spinning at Resolution?  I really want to be there, but I also
wanna know who I am going to see. Thanks... Casey

regarding the little kind-of-a-party thing in kent on thursday, as aaron
said (on the pb-cle list) "titonton was awesome". and he was. he got
everybody grooving + yelling out "whoo! yeah!" with this crazy tweaked-out
minimal techno/house. the man is an absolute GENIUS. this was the best PA
i have seen him do. he was playing this jazzy piano stuff at one time +
then turned around + played behind his back, then sat on the keys + slid
across them + it sounded so cool. i gave him a hug before he went on
cause he looked really nervous + i said good luck + he said break a
leg, so i said oops! yeah break a leg. the place was really packed, i'm
glad so many people were there. bad things were: the cops shut it down at
3:45, so walt didn't get to spin for his full hour, and i was told i'd be
paid $20 for the rental of my turntables (plus i brought all kinds of
extension cords, rca cords, electrical tape, etc. over for them since i
live right across the street, + spun for an hour at the beginning), but i
didn't get paid + nobody would tell me why but they said they would make
it up to me. i don't know who else got paid though. next week i'll give
them 1 more chance but if i don't get my money or a very good explanation,
they'll have to "borrow" somebody else's turntables. it's one thing to
admit or say you can't afford to pay somebody, that's totally acceptable,
but it's another thing to promise money to someone but not pay them + not
even explain why.

I'm almost positive there is a huge party in cleveland on february 14th as
well, called g-spot.. they have aux 88 & cirrus live, plus a bad boy bill and
richard humpty vision tagteam...   i don't know how much you care about having
a party in pb and cleveland, but i dont think it benefits either party to do
so..  i can probably find out more about the cleveland party if anyone needs
info..

thanks lou, but the party on feb 14 in pgh is gonna be a low-key affair,
~300 tops...i don't think there will be much of a conflict, most of the ppl
attending these parties either can't or don't want to travel out of town for
a party...stickman's party however, which looks *really* good btw :) is
moving to another date a couple of weeks down the line, and hopefully
there won't be a conflict with anything else...


more to come :)

peace,
hossam

what's up pittsburgh :)

doc cutup said:

Excellent!  A battle sounds wicked!  I'v been thinking of a similar idea
for a while - short sets, elimination rounds, djs pullin' out all the
tricks and stops, and of course, judgement by the crowd. :)


[i say:]

[of course :) yeah, were gonna run it along the basically standard rules;
rough plan is this: all participants must personally submit entries in a box
that will be located somewhere during a steel city, well prolly accept
entries over the course of two scj's...then listen to the entries and pick
the top six...3 contestants the next two scj's will get half hour sets,
starting at 9pm...(we'll also get kids in the door earlier this way we
hope...) and then the best based on crowd response and the six
members of scj as secondary judges....i'm not sure if we'll have the two
winners battle or if we will just pick one winner, i'm leaning towards the
two best battling :) and then the winner will get like $50 or $75 and good
time slot at an upcoming scj...sound ok?]

Some djs I'd like to hear:

Any UK djs if you can get them, Everfresh (Toronto), RAW (LA), Curios
(LA), KRISPE (Oklahoma i think), KPAKPO (philly)...other's too: the more
variety the better.

[everfresh's name came up at the meeting on Saturday, i'll pass along
kpako's name esp, as well as the others...as far as uk junglists...i'll be a
bitch and just say 'hold tight in the 98' ;)

Some djs I'd like to see back again: J Smooth (my fav dj of the moment),
Karl K (last set was impressive), Tik Tak...hey it would be cool to see
them ex-patriots Farmer Tea and Starchild back once again, if they
haven't forgotten us.. ;)

[i liked j smooth's stuff too, but a bit of it seemed way more r 'n b than
drum n bass u know? i mean i love hip hop or rnb acapellas over clean
drum breaks, but there were long stretches of just vocals w/no beats or
super slow beats....but yeah i liked him :) karl will more than likely be
coming back next year, and the farmer pretty much just has to show up
and tell us :)...same thing basically for djs that have played before that
did a good job, they just need to tell us when/if they'll be in the area
again, and we'll definitely try to mix them up along with the new talent
were gonna keep breaking...]

Also: no dis to you Hossam, but I'd like to see more MCs take the mic, at
least as an experiment.  It seems to be an element of jungle kulture that
isn't really played up much...maybe it's coz we don't have any?

[i would like to see the same thing! i'm not a microphone fascist by any
means, it's just that *nobody* else has asked/offered/tried...not b/c i/we
havent let them...i mean personally, the way i'm gonna look at it is this:
the same as with a new dj: if they want to give it a shot, the opening slot
is all theirs...as long as they don't *really* suck, they're gonna get a
shot...and if they are dope, then i'd love to have a partner (flowing with
someone on another mike is so fun) for the hype sets...as it is, i'm prolly
gonna be on the mike at some point during phantoms set (i can't wait,
he's my favorite us jungle dj :) as well as jeffee's set on the 30th...


speaking of the 30th, now is a good time to announce the fact that we
have a (*drum roll*) very special guest in addition to jeffee :)

we know how much u all loved him @ the graffiti show, so we're
bringing him back just for you :)

yup, those of you who complain about not enuff jump up @ scj should be
happy with both jeffee and 187 on the 30th, alongside our dope ass
residents sine and dj squared, scj may be extended an hour or so
(10-3am) on the 30th b/c of a lot of ppl not having to work the next day :)

and then...well, that's another post ;) (some of you who went to
sessions will know what i'm referring to)

peace and respects going out....

>>> Troy Mouer <mou1772@waynesburg.edu> 12/07/97 05:34pm >>>

Speaking of bad weather....what the hell is up with Pittsburgh, ice and 
snow, and raves.  I didn't make it up to Sessions either due to bad 
road conditions and my rear-wheel drive car.  Same thing happened a 
couple weeks ago with the Eastland Mall event!  My time is running short.

Is there anything going on next weekend? 

troy.   

On Sun, 7 Dec 1997, Geoffrey M Maddock wrote (re: sessions):

> How was it? Reviews?
 

[pittsburgh has a history of some of the best parties being on the *worst*
nites...jungle warfare one is far and away the best example...HORRIBLE
weather, and one of the best jungle parties i've ever been to. period. up
there with the vibe during kenny ken and warren g's set @ bassrush 4,
up there with roni size, l double, bryan gee and a live pa by urban
shakedown with mc's dynamite and flux @ utopia in toronto. jungle
warfare one was the *bomb*...but anyway...on to sessions:


i liked it: i thought the space and sound and lights were dope...i was very
happy with the # of ppl who showed up (318 paid attendance)...i thought
a lot of djs delivered really strong sets, esp. brian dietrich (b. dee), andy
(sine) who spun a surprising half jungle/ half old skool breaks which
totally reminded me of his 'baddest dj' set at free 2 at the science center
(i was tripping balls at that party :)...and whoever spun after him...i got
confused with the whole monte/jc5 thing, but i think it was monte...it
went andy, <monte/jc5>, and then dust...the party got shut down during
dust's set tho...here's the story as it happened:

andy was walking around and saw a kid with a glass bowl...andy went
up to him, and asked him to put the bowl away, as there was an off duty
police officer hired by the sessions crew doing security...off duty or not,
the cop wasn't going to tolerate any blatant drug use...the kid made a
quick movement towards his pocket and said: 'what bowl'...andy said
'the bowl you just put in your pocket'...the kid said 'which pocket'...andy
looked down and saw the kid had dropped the bowl on the ground 'the
bowl that u just dropped and broke'...the kid looked around all quick and
nervous like, and made like he was about to run off, so andy asked him
to leave the party...after making a bit of a fuss, the kid was lead out to
the sidewalk in front of the building, where he was searched and found
to have 18 bags of crack cocaine on him. the kid was arrested and the
cops were called.

after taking the kid away, the cops said they would be back in about 45
minutes to check out the rest of the party.

andy took control of the situation at this point, (rather than let the situation
take control of the party) and got on the mike and made an
announcement that the party was shutting down because of the
reasons i just mentioned (he didn't go into the details other than some kid
from cleveland had come down and was arrested with 18 bags of crack
and the cops were coming back in 45 mins to shut down the
party)...rather than have the cops come back, and search everyone
thoroughly and have the same end result happen, andy made the
call....one of the kids friends protested very loudly that this whole thing
was bullshit, that the kid didn't have crack on him...he said it was opium,
but none of us there had ever seen opium in clear/white rock/crystalline
form...have you? he said he was from cleveland, where they threw
REAL parties, with dj dan, etc..etc.. (i'm not gonna even start a pgh vs
cle. war, i got nothing but love for my peeps in c-town ;) the kid was told
he needed to relax, he refused, and then he was shown the door...

i think it was the right call to make...this wasn't a personal vendetta
against this one kid, as some ppl said, andy didn't even know him. andy
(rightfully in my view) got pissed that some kid would be so stupid and
disrespectful of what the sessions crew was trying to do as to bring
that much shit with them...everyone's opinion pretty much is 'i don't care
what the fuck you do with your body, just don't fuck it up for the rest of
us'...i know everyone involved with the party worked really hard to pull it
off and make it as successful as it was, up until about 5 am...what do u
all think?

some ppl said that andy was wrong in shutting his own party down, that
the motto 'the party must go on' takes precedence, but they arent seeing
the long view...next time the sessions crew throws the party, they
(hopefully) will know that they arent a bunch of irresponsible kids...that
they are doing it for ppl to get together and have a good time and dance
to some really good music. that's it. everything else is secondary, and
things that will hurt the party are not tolerated. hopefully this will actually
HELP the reputation of parties and a few promoters in pgh., as opposed
to all the (deservedly in most cases) negative publicity the scene has
gotten.

here's hoping that the next party they throw turns out much better...

peace,
hossam

pb-cle ravers...

it made me very sad to read hossam's review of sessions.
after throwing parties for a few years, sunshine kids
called it quits this summer.  throughout our time throwing
parties we had to deal with people doing stupid things
all the time.  a perfect example of this was a party we
threw called elite.  this was in many peoples opinions
one of the best pgh parties ever.  we had a warehouse
that we could have used for years.  but, some assholes
had to tag all over the space.  the owners of the warehouse
pulled out and another perfect space was lost.  the
fucked-up thing is that nobody learns.  andy and crew 
are working very hard to throw quality parties in pgh.
i know how much andy likes to throw parties, but how
long will it be before he throws in the towell, and leaves
it to less capable promoters?  why make him?  all it takes
is a little responsibility from everyone.  if you can't 
handle that, stay the fuck home!  i remember four or five
years ago there were no parties in pgh, and we had to travel
every fucking weekend.  imagine not having any parties at
all in your hometown, that sucks.  it is closer than you 
might think.

>but thats just me..

i definately dig live acts, some of the best parties i've been to were
comprised of mostly live acts, buuut djs make the scene.  i really
couldn't tell you what i like more.  theres something more to it than
matching beats.  djs can take you places, when your body is moving but
your mind is wandering with whatever is being mixed.  and nothing,
nothing can beat some phat ass scratching.  god, i love that.  plus the
fact that a great dj will mix many different styles of music together to
make one big trip full of peaks and valleys with some special shit for
your ass.  ecclecticness (is that a word?) is what makes djs so good.

i am going to get a little bit crazy here, but you know what i love the
most?  that feeling you get when you just picked up a new record/cd and
are totally in love with it for like a whole day.  you like look at it 30
times, read everything on the cover and inside, and smell that new vinyl
smell.  there's nothing like it.

you know what else i love?  sitting at home, when no one else is, and
cranking up my stereo so that the bass shakes all the stuff all the walls
upstairs and putting my 200 disk changer on random shuffle.  it's like
with every song it plays, it is a little surprise gift.  esspecially when
it stops on some of the old shit, like acen, meat beat manifesto or old
prodigy.  

but enough, i am rambling and i am late for class.

peace.

man, i have a friend that says that all the time.  and calls people
'hunk-e-o.'  you got me.  most the slang i use entails cuss words, 'kewl'
(back from the old-skool bbs-ing fido-net days -- yeah, i was a r0dent),
and i overuse the word 'phat.'  a raver dictionaery sounds like a good
idea, but tell me, how many different types of slang would it include? 
the thing about 'ravers' is that they are all different but are brought
together by the same thing.  'it's the music.'  i think the word 'raver'
is such an amorphous term.

oh, i agree.  i think the slang sounds neat, but someone who can only
talk in slang has a serious problem.  yeah, i use slang, but i guess i
use it to convey emotions i get from music, parties, and (sometimes)
drugs.  i don't get crazy with it unless i am rolling pretty hard.  i
understand you being disenfranchised with the drug-head ravers, but i
think that is just due to the effects of the drugs they are on.  it makes
you stupid sometimes.  but hey, all's cool if your having a good time,
right?  right right.

i agree with this too.  i think the world would be ten times better if
everyone could experience a rave and the vibe.  i never felt so accepted
and never accepted others like i have at a rave.  god, it fills me with
so much love for people, and i used to be a misinthropic apathetic little
shit.  it just is so healthy to let everything go and allow the music to
fill you up.  and dance, god, i love to dance.  but enough of this
emotional dribble.

no shit.  i am a better person now for having been subjected to the
scene.  but of course, i thought high school was pointless and i learned
more in four years of debate (policy) that i ever did in high school. 
they taught me nothing about philosophy and creative/critical thinking in
high school, and now, even college seems useless sometimes..  the only
thing that high school teaches is how to be a mindless sheep and be like
everybody else.  think for yourself? 
 what a joke.  

i remember when i first started listening to the music, and it seemed
like a natural progression for me.  when i first realized that there was
a whole world of music out there besides what was on the radio and mtv, i
was listining to the pixies, throwing muses, and indie label artists. 
then i got into kmfdm, thrill kill kult, and meat beat manifesto.  then,
my sophomore year (93-94) my friend ryan gave me this cd called 'instinct
dance' compiled by moby.  needless to say, i was hooked, and my life
completely changed.  i became more accepting of others, i had a better
opinion of myself, and i actually started being friendly to others, even
if they weren't as 'hardcore' as i thought i was.  that pisses me off the
most, how people think they are so much more 'underground' than somone
else.  i can't believe i used to think that way.  now, i barely listen to
'secular' (a little word we use to describe non-electronic stuff) but i
still cherish the old stuff i used to listen to.  i would say music is
the most important thing in my life, even more important than the scene
itself.  in fact, i really didn't get into the scene until '95, when i
went to the family affair.  but that changed me too.  i did e for the
first time there.  wow.   my life has changed a lot since i was 16, but
it has all been for the better.

respect,

i am interested, actually.  this reminds me of a big writeup in the akron
beacon journal about the big top tour.  it was talking about the 'secret
world of rave,' pretty hilarious if you ask me.  i have a bunch of copies
and i could type the text up if anyone is interested.  the funny thing
about the article is that there is a photo of me on the second page. 
it's hillarious.  i can't believe they took my picture.

damn homes!  you were 17 back then?  geez, i think i was like 12.  wait a
minute, i am 19 now, and that was like 8 years ago, so i was 11!  Holy
shit.  I can't even remember being that young.  but yeah, my taste in
music sucked back then.  vanilla ice, warrant, poison, bon jovi, yeeeuck!
 i wish someone could have given me a clue.  

but i don't care, some of mc hammer's shit is still phat.  i must be like
a freak or something, but i'll listen to hammer and old old hip hop
occasionally.  long live young mc and dj magic mike!

>[word :) i just need more money ;)]

man, i could use 10 g's right now, and i know exactly what i'd do.  i'd
get some technics turnatables and a mixer, a 909 and a 303 groovebox and,
well lets just say i'd buy a lot of shit and hit the road.  my friend
ryan likes to scratch, so he could do that, while i get to play around
with synths and keyboards.  that would be the shit.

it's cool when other people make music to fuck you up, but it'd be ten
times better when you make your own music to fuck your head god.

but enough, everyone has their dreams.  it just sucks when you are making
all this tight music in your head but have no means of getting it out for
others to enjoy.

>:P ...read my upcoming post re: nye and get back to me, ok?]

funny, i feel the same way about myself . . . 100% right. 8.]   but on
the serious tip, i live in canton, ohio.  boring town, but cool because i
can get to pittsburgh or cleveland in a small amount of time and akron is
20 minutes up i77.  i usually spend my week going to local clubs (u4ia in
cleveland, etc) and my weekends looking for kickass parties to go to. 
only problem is my best friend loves the music more than the scene, so he
usually isn't up to much traveling.  but he loves the 3 day outdoor
parties.  so i usually am getting around more in the spring/summer.  

you know what i can't believe?  i've been on this list for like 4 months
but never wrote anything until now.  mainly, i just used it to find out
about events.  damn, i was stupid.  i'll read your post and respond to it
too, but i am late for logic class so i got to jet.

what they do.  i mean, just think of all the slang names for drugs. 
crack, crank, roll, hops, denk, bhudda, etc.  it;s so wierd, but for some
reason, i wanna know about it.

ahh, i'm just buggin'.

Ya know,
	The cool thing about being a musick major is once your basic
classes (i.e. english comp., history, science, math, etc) are done, all
you have to do is play with music stuff.  I get to learn about half notes,
whole notes, 32nd notes and 3/2 time, 12/8 time, and c time.  Then I get
to distinguish an augmented chord from a diminished chord from a minor
chord from a Mm7 chord from a major chord.  Oh yeah, barrel 'o' monkeys.
	Sometimes I wonder if when I'm all done with learning about this
music stuff if I'll be so sick of it, I'll never want to touch it again.
I doubt it but I suppose anything's possible.  Right now I get to sing
about Semele's bosom and Jove laying on it.  Boy, Handel was x-rated.
Then I can sing about white oxen grazing down at the dyke.  There's more
but I won't bore you with the details.  You're just the only captive
audience I have, um, so to speak.  Good Luck fellow finals sufferers!!

see them thinking, "Man, we can really use this shitty-ass music to suck 
dry these little misled middle class kids."

Then, you wrote:

I am really trying to understand this paragraph, mebbe its coz i'm jus

you mean resolution lineup is shitty, thursday in kent's was shitty, or 
both? taken at face value the resolution lineup, not counting the ppl i 
know will not be there, is really good, except for a local or two whose 
music and attitudes i don't care for, but i won't start a political 
argument, it is a very talented lineup

Now I'm writing:

     No, I know they aren't by the same promoters.  In the two separate 
paragraphs I was talking about two different subjects.  First, I was 
talking about rectifying a mistake of mine that may have started the 
"too many DJs" debate, and, next, I was responding to someone who asked 
for any information anyone had about the promoters of "Resolution".  I 
wasn't passing judgement on the performers, just on the promoters.  At 
the event in Kent there were lots of these "jock" guys who looked like 
their sole purpose for attending was to pass out flyers for 
"Resolution". (They had an extremely large stack of them and, in leu of 
listening to the music, dancing, or even simply watching, they were 
approaching everyone present.)  I inferred that they must be somehow 
connected to, if not just BE themselves, the promoters of "Resolution".  
I thought I should tell the person who was asking questions about the 
"track record" of these promoters that these people at least LOOKED like 
they didn't know much about the music they were promoting.  Sorry if 
anything I've said has been ambiguous.   

Next, you wrote:

I'm writing:

     Yeah, I did catch some of it.  Are you the "Tiko" in "Tiko and

asked.

I think limiting supply as a promoting technique has been too often
ignored.  So, what do you think?

I'd agree with you on this point.  However, I don't think that, short of 
a mass collaboration between all the promoters in a given area, it's 
possible.  I mean, I don't think the average party-goers, the ones who, 
because of the fact that most parties are primarily composed of them, 
generate the most income for promoters, will really be affected by a 
singular promoter deciding to do what it is you are proposing.  I think, 
to them, a pay-in-advance-only event would seem like a foreign, 
isolated, exclusive event.  If someone just goes to parties and he/she 
isn't really part of the scene (which, by the way, I think there's 
nothing wrong with), then he/she probably views all decently-large 
events in the same light, and, therefore, would be unaffected if a 
single promoter chose to do what you're saying.  "Joe Raver" will just 
go to the next event that doesn't require so much work and dedication.  
It all just depends on your target audience.  If you're holding a show 
featuring a given artist and want to attract people who specifically 
want to see that artist, then your technique might work.  However, if 
you're proposing your idea as a change in the marketing of ALL parties, 
I don't think it will work.  A promoter will always see profit in doing 
it the "usual" way, so the collaboration I spoke of before is probably 
impossible.  Basically, to sum up what I'm saying, marketing is, by 
definition, selling a product to the masses, and, unless it's the only 
way the masses can get to party, I don't think they care enough about 
any given party to warrant their going out of their way to get into it.

                                          Aaron

you know, this is a very good reason why i should declare a major.  i am
so sick of general ed shit.  but the thing is, i have come to wonder why
am i in college?

i've been thinking about this a lot lately.  am i goging to school to get
a degree so i can get a career and start living a 'normal' life?  am i
going becasue it is something to do after high school?  or am i going to
learn about whatever i please?  

see, the way i figure it, i am there becasue i want to learn about things
i am interested it.  so screw the major/minor bullshit and the gen-ed
requirements.  i am going to take the classes i want to take, like
ethics, astronomy, and the psychology of psychoactive drugs.  i really
don't care about getting a degree, i figure in time i will figure out
something to do after i stop partying and settling down.  but i don't
know if that will happen anytime soon.  i really don't look forward to
the prospect of living a 'normal' life.  but what is a 'normal' life? 
all i know is that it is probably one in which i can't get stoned
everyday and roll every weekend like i do now.  and that sucks.

you know, i would like to take a bunch of classes in electronics though,
mix 'em with a few music theory classes and i may have myself a career.

I don't actually remember a time when I didn't know what I wanted to be
when I grew up.  I always wanted to be something.  First I wanted to be a
ballerina.  Then I wanted to be an artist.  Then I wanted to be an
astronaut.  Now I want to be an opera singer.  The difference between all
the other purposed careers and my present choice is that I'm really good
at what I do now.  If and when you chose a major, you should consider not
only what you're interested in, but what you're good at and are so
interested in that you want to do it for a very long time.  
My advice to you for the time being is to not waste your time putting off
the general ed stuff.  If you haven't already, get it all done and out of
the way.  That way, you'll have a lot of credits to use up for whatever
you choose to pursue.  
I believe that everyone should consider further education after high
school or the equivelant whether it's college, tech school, whatever.
Education will bring success.  "Smart is sexier than stupid anyday"  I
think that's the cheesy quote from "The More You Know".  Anyway, Good
Luck.  Live long and prosper!

Excerpts from mail: 8-Dec-97 {pb-cle} Sessions review by Hossam
El-Saie@qualmed.c 
> i know everyone involved with the party worked really hard to pull it
> off and make it as successful as it was, up until about 5 am...what do u
> all think?
> 

hossam's review of the party was right on.  it was really positive,
which i think has a lot to do with the people who put it on and really
care about the scene.  i would guess that 3/4 of the people there were
dancing most of the night, unlike most of the recent parties i've been
to (temptation), which seem to mostly involve camping/sleeping along the
wall.  it seems obvious that small parties like this are one answer to
the problems with the scene here that a lot of people have been voicing
on this list for the last year.  

what is really fucked up about the crack-down is that dustin, one of the
organizers, had just started spinning. he was really happy that they
broke even and was having a great time and looking forward to his set. 
so was i, his deep and mellow house is perfect 6 am music.  to add
insult injury, he was spinning in the second room at temptation when it
got busted up.  he looked really sad when it had to be stopped, which
isn't the way the evening should have ended up.

I would just like to give much respect to the Matt and the Sunshine Kids for
throwing total bombs! Elite was like my 5th party and I had one of the best
times of my life it was when I relized that what we do is the future. And I
was completely and utterly hooked. And I totally agree with what your saying
man. I had heard rumors that the Kids were through now I know for sure and
Im thouroughly disapointed. But I just wanted to let you know that you made
the scene what it is for me. At least partialy.

True say to both these commentaries.  When's the last time Tintonton
played in Pittsburgh, by the way?

And yeah, why is it there is such a push for every American junglist to
sound like dey from da Bwonx?  Yo, shitty, yo like read dat FARCE of a
chat list type thing at www.breakbeatscience.com/lounge for example of the
lowest form of life on the net.  I would expect better things from
Breakbeat Science.  You'd think they'd like monitor it or password
it or soemthing, but they don't seem to give a fcuk.  Not only is it just
a bunch of people fighting over nothing, the language of some of the
people is really exaggerated and really funny.  They're trying so darn
hard, I'm tempted to bet money half of them are from Mildsville, Suburbia,
New Jersey.  It's gotten so bad people have impersonated other people and
said things that could have been detrimental to their careers.  Ehem.  No,
the world is not full of PLUR.

Anyway, if it ever seems like I or others on this list get pissy about
netiquette, for me anyway it's because I've seen stuff like that happen
and it ain't pretty.  You can't say anything intelligent.  One thing I've
liked about pb-cle is that it's stayed pretty consistently on the up and
up for the time I've been on.  Yeah, it's had its ups and downs, but none
of the arguments for looser regulation or stuff like that have _really_
had much of an effect in the long run, and I'm glad about that.

No, I don't really have an AOL account.  That was a JOKE.  Much like the

Yo, 18 bags of anything is soemthing to be ashamed of.  It sounds like Andy
did the right thing.  Shutting down a one-off thing in the park because
some neighbor may or may not have made a noise complaint is one thing, but
when it's a professional setup hoping to continue, also already having gone
till 5 in the morning, shutting down to protect the partyers and future
parties is one of the few viable options you have.  The game has changed,
and if you don't realize it and act accordingly, the game plays you.

Keep up the good work.

side note:
I took a look at some pages, and Kate O+'s happened to be one.  She's got
this one page with the most impressive photo on it...And if even _I'm_
impressed, you know it's pretty good.  Anyway, I won't give away the puch
line, but go to the pb-cle home page and follow the link to her page,
navigate to the "issues" section and tell me whatcha think.

love,
steph

Um, I think the fact that you get stoned every day and roll every weekend
is a good indication that you should stop wasting you or your parents'
money, get out of school, find a sugar mommy or daddy, and get your shite
together before you give it another go.

I had a history teacher who loved the thought of all young people joining
the army before going to school, like they do in Israel.  There are so many
people out there who would kiss someone's smelly feet for the luxury of
pissing around "finding themselves" for a few years before deciding what to
"really" study.  

Man, if I could afford grad school right now...or even a second
degree...And don't get me wrong, I took school seriously, but you don't
know what you have till it's gone, and it's a lot deeper than schmokin' up
when the spirit moves you.

My advice to people who actually care is to take your time and study what
feels right, explore, but actually get soemthing out of it, please.  Take
advantage of the people, the study abroad programs, the wealth of
knowledge, discounts, libraries, programs, organizations, hi-tech
equipment...My gosh!!!  You have so much stuff at your fingertips!  If you
don't have a clue how to take advantage of that, join the rest of us beyond
the grave and get an appreciation for things like free transportation,
resources up the butt, thinking people all around you...

And as for beyond the grave, I would suggest studying somethig that will
get you a job shortly after leaving school, or will land you back in school
with a scholarship.  I'm at a nice job which i can't complain about becuase
I can buy all the groceries I want and pay my rent and stuff, but I do
something that is like a smidgen of what I do best, a smidgen of things I'm
interested in and want to learn more about, and a lot of busy work that I
can't be proud of no matter how well I might do it because it's not my own.
 It's nice not to be penniless, but it would be better to have come out
better prepared, or at least having studied soemthing that I actually cared
about by the time I graduated.  I went for a comprimise and I wouldn't do
it again.  Go for broke if it feels right.  Talk to people in the field
about what it's really like, but if you think you can excel at it, give it
a try.

And as far as a "normal" life, there's soemthing to be said for the wisdom
of the ancients.  My grandmother's "normal" and she's one of the coolest
people I know.  I've made a lot of comprimises, like I don't spend as much
time on music as I'd like, I don't stay out till 4 on worknights unless I
REALLY want to, stuff like that, but once you figure out what's actually
important, being "normal" isn't so scary anymore.  I know who I am and
wearing a blazer to work (that I got at a garage sale for $3, thank you)
doesn't bother me.  Fitting in on the outside is nothing more than
derailing prejudice before it happens.  It makes it easier for you to
really be yourself when the important stuff comes up. 

Plus, once you let down your guard, you find that a lot of peope you
overlooked before are pretty darn interesting.  In my department I work
with a theater major who taught computer animation, a Jehovah's witness, a
meditating karate instructor who is also a yinzer, a BellLabs vet who
helped develp the Internet, a contemporary classical music composer who
tried his hand at physical modelling and wrote filters in C, who is now a
Java programmer, an Israeli ex-patriate, a girl who's as crazy about Bjork
as I am, and a former Miss NewJersey, also currently persuing a masters in
business "because it's still a man's world".  The other day another
co-worker excitedly caled me into his cube to show me the new Steinberg
program, "Rebirth" which is a digitized combination fo the Roland 303, 808
and 909.  He played some samples that came with it and they were all
detroit-ish techno.  Now he wants to write some detroit for the next
multi-media thing he does for the company, and was even entertaining the
thought of using Joe187's stuff.  Then there's the guy who's working on
artificial intelligence to mainstream customer service and support, not to
mention the guy who plays in the bagpipe band and the guy who plays in like
5 different bands.  It's less about the stereotype of normal than about how
you choose your priorities and how you balance your social dealings.

>so screw the major/minor bullshit and the gen-ed
>requirements.  i am going to take the classes i want to take, like
>ethics, astronomy, and the psychology of psychoactive drugs.  i really
>don't care about getting a degree, i figure in time i will figure out
>something to do after i stop partying and settling down.  but i don't

Oh, so you're on the "from now until hell freezes over" plan...  You know,
there's a cheaper way to piss around and learn what you want...it's called
a library card.


>you know, i would like to take a bunch of classes in electronics though,
>mix 'em with a few music theory classes and i may have myself a career.

Now you're on to something...how do you feel about running a studio?  would
you really be excited about a comprimise like that?  If not, keep looking.

Ok, why do we ex-Catholics have to be everyone's mother?  I think I'm
finally done.

Subject: 	RE: {pb-cle} Too Many DJs/Resolution

I wrote:     

     "In relation to the scepticism surrounding the integrity and 
quality of the promoters of "Resolution", from my own observations 
Thursday, think it's justified.  A group of people who I could tell 
weren't into the scene at all were passing out flyers for it.  I could 
see them thinking, "Man, we can really use this shitty-ass music to suck 
dry these little misled middle class kids."

Then, you wrote:

I am really trying to understand this paragraph, mebbe its coz i'm jus 
dumb...thursday in kent and resolution aren't the same promoters...i 
think you were alluding they were, i dunno.......shitty assed music? did 
you mean resolution lineup is shitty, thursday in kent's was shitty, or 
both? taken at face value the resolution lineup, not counting the ppl i 
know will not be there, is really good, except for a local or two whose 
music and attitudes i don't care for, but i won't start a political 
argument, it is a very talented lineup

Now I'm writing:

     No, I know they aren't by the same promoters.  In the two separate 
paragraphs I was talking about two different subjects.  First, I was 
talking about rectifying a mistake of mine that may have started the 
"too many DJs" debate, and, next, I was responding to someone who asked 
for any information anyone had about the promoters of "Resolution".  I 
wasn't passing judgement on the performers, just on the promoters.  At 
the event in Kent there were lots of these "jock" guys who looked like 
their sole purpose for attending was to pass out flyers for 
"Resolution". (They had an extremely large stack of them and, in leu of 
listening to the music, dancing, or even simply watching, they were 
approaching everyone present.)  I inferred that they must be somehow 
connected to, if not just BE themselves, the promoters of "Resolution".  
I thought I should tell the person who was asking questions about the 
"track record" of these promoters that these people at least LOOKED like 
they didn't know much about the music they were promoting.  Sorry if 
anything I've said has been ambiguous.   

Next, you wrote:

post script: did you catch that phat-assed house tag team by tiko & 
jason? -:P

I'm writing:

     Yeah, I did catch some of it.  Are you the "Tiko" in "Tiko and 
Jason"?  I noticed your e-mail address and thought that might be why you 
asked.

                                                 Aaron

Sine spun half jungle/half old skool breaks!  I now wish I hadn't heard 
anything about the party.  I CAN'T believe I missed this....I'm kicking 
myself right now.....there I just did it again....and once more for old 
time's sake.

Too bad about the crack incident.

Elite was an excellent party. That space was raw as hell and the vibe was
thick enough to slice wid bread knife. Dante's morning disko/house set was
KILLA and the aftah hrs was lovely. I bet with the correct persuasion some
wily promoter could obtain that space... like wave a G or so in his face I
don't think he'll turn it down.

once again rick, the point was not how much money a
"promoter" could wave in someone's face.  the elite
space was very cheap

the point is that the elite space was very cheap,
but all the money in the world would not make the
owner want to let people tag and break windows
again.  i would have been sued if tim zelch and 
others had not helped me clean some of the space
the week after the party.  rick, enthusiasm
is just one part of being a "promoter".
responsibility is much more important.
this is not a dis, i spent a lot of time
trying to do what was right for the scene,
now it is up to the people who care to
step up and do what's right.

Here here!  These attitudes I percieve are not survival traits!!!  I'm going
to try not to rant or expound too much here, but forgive me if I do, I am
having quite an emotional reaction to this thread.  I find it amazing that
our society supports the sort of person who has prime goals of enjoying a
daily dose of drugs and perhaps hearing about some interesting things, and
is not ashamed of it.  I suppose I took this out of context ( please note
huge benifit of the doubt here).  I am just in utter and complete disbelief
that this is truly what someone wants to have their life amount to, this is
what someone aspires to.  Please, I would love to hear you correct me and
tell me that I am mistaken, and that this interpretation is not correct.  

If there is anything that raving has given to me, it is the deep belief that
there are wonderful, caring people out there.  I believe that we should
enjoy each other and the joys of life (yes, of course!), and do what we can
to contribute more beautiful things to the society we live in and benefit
from.  I don't believe I can ever pay back all of the goodness that is given
to me, but I sure am going to try, in part by doing my job, my little piece
of the puzzle, as well as possible.  It makes me feel good, better than
anything else.  Ok, this is all very idealistic, but I LIKE idealism.  Don't
have a 'normal' life, aspire to a 'supernormal' life!!!

PLUR!

In reference to the kid who said:
>> but what is a 'normal' life?
>>all i know is that it is probably one in which i can't get stoned
>>everyday and roll every weekend like i do now.  and that sucks.
I think it's sad that the only thing he values about an "abnormal"  
life is the drugs.  I know lots of kids who say "I could never grow  
up and have a normal job and a normal life" but that doesn't mean  
they all have to end up as burnouts.  I think the idea of having  
something other than a normal life is very valuable.  Being able to  
transcend the mass mentality and lead whatever life brings you the  
most satisfaction is what it's all about.  I don't think going to  
school and having some direction in life conflicts with this at all.  
 Having an education opens up more opportunities to do what YOU  
want with your life.

what's up pittsburgh :)

doc cutup said:

Excellent!  A battle sounds wicked!  I'v been thinking of a similar idea
for a while - short sets, elimination rounds, djs pullin' out all the
tricks and stops, and of course, judgement by the crowd. :)


[i say:]

[of course :) yeah, were gonna run it along the basically standard rules;
rough plan is this: all participants must personally submit entries in a box
that will be located somewhere during a steel city, well prolly accept
entries over the course of two scj's...then listen to the entries and pick
the top six...3 contestants the next two scj's will get half hour sets,
starting at 9pm...(we'll also get kids in the door earlier this way we
hope...) and then the best based on crowd response and the six
members of scj as secondary judges....i'm not sure if we'll have the two
winners battle or if we will just pick one winner, i'm leaning towards the
two best battling :) and then the winner will get like $50 or $75 and good
time slot at an upcming scj...sound ok?]

Some djs I'd like to hear:

Any UK djs if you can get them, Everfresh (Toronto), RAW (LA), Curios
(LA), KRISPE (Oklahoma i think), KPAKPO (philly)...other's too: the more
variety the better.

[everfresh's name came up at the meeting on Saturday, i'll pass along
kpako's name esp, as well as the others...as far as uk junglists...i'll be a
bitch and just say 'hold tight in the 98' ;)

Some djs I'd like to see back again: J Smooth (my fav dj of the moment),
Karl K (last set was impressive), Tik Tak...hey it would be cool to see
them ex-patriots Farmer Tea and Starchild back once again, if they
haven't forgotten us.. ;)

[i liked jsmooths stuff too, but a bit of it seemed way more r 'n b than
drum n bass u know? i mean i love hip hop or rnb acapellas over clean
drum breaks, but there were long stretches of just vocals w/no beats or
super slow beats....but yeah i liked him :) karl will more than likely be
coming back next year, and the farmer pretty much just has to show up
and tell us :)...same thing basically for djs that have played before that
did a good job, they just need to tell us when/if theyll be in the area again,
and we'll definitely try to mix them up along with the new talent were
gonna keep breaking...]

Also: no dis to you Hossam, but I'd like to see more MCs take the mic, at
least as an experiment.  It seems to be an element of jungle kulture that
isn't really played up much...maybe its coz we don't have any?

[i would like to see the same thing! i'm not a microphone facist by any
means, it's just that *nobody* else has asked/offered/tried...not b/c i/we
havent let them...i mean personally, the way i'm gonna look at it is this:
the same as with a new dj: if they want to give it a shot, the opening slot
is all theirs...as long as they don't *really* suck, theyre gonna get a
shot...and if they are dope, then i'd love to have a partner (flowing with
someone on another mike is so fun) for the hype sets...as it is, i'm prolly
gonna be on the mike at some point during phantoms set (i can't wait,
he's my favorite us jungle dj :) as well as jeffee's set on the 30th...


speaking of the 30th, now is a good time to announce the fact that we
have a (*drum roll*) very special guest in addition to jeffee :)

we know how much u all loved him @ the graffiti show, so we're
bringing him back just for you :)

yup, those of you who complain about not enuff jump up @ scj should be
happy with both jeffee and 187 on the 30th, alongside our dope ass
residents sine and dj squared, scj may be extended an hour or so
(10-3am) on the 30th b/c of a lot of ppl not having to work the next day :)

and then...well, that's another post ;) (some of you who went to
sessions will know what i'm referring to)

peace and respects going out....

you know, everybody makes such a big deal about 'netiquette' but i have
to be the first to say that internet etiquite now is ten times better
than how people acted in the old days of modeming when no one was on the
internet and everyone dialed up local and long distance BBSs.  there were
hardcore flames everyday, and don't even ask about the old BBS wars. 
those would get really ugly.  most of the people that post here are
intelligent and treat you with respect.  of course, i would hope that
everybody tries to do that outside of e-mail as well.

18 bags!!!!!  why do you need 18 bags of anything at a party?  look, i
could understand making a few sells, but this guy was looking to supply a
small village!  might as well have passed them out like goodies at the
door.

but on the serious tip, i agree that shutting it down was the right thing
to do.  if the police cam back and started searching everyone, it could
have got real messy real fast, and then you have a situation like down in
orlando where they passed that anti-rave bill.  it is just a shame some
dealer had to be impetuous and fuck up the vibe for all the people who
care.  i use drugs and occasionally sell them, but that is downright
disrespectful to the promoters and the partiers.  i know drugs go hand in
hand with the scene, and i am cool with it, but it really pisses me off
when i see dealers at events that don't go because they enjoy the music
or the scene, they go to sell drugs and that's it.  props to andy for
realizing the implications of the situation and acting with his head.  

just thought i'd add my 2 cents to the issue.

well, i have had dreams of what i wanted to be since i could remember,
but actually having a legitimate idea of what i will really be doing,
that presents a problem.  I pretty much have made up my mind that
whatever i do will involve computers, since that is what i am good with
and i enjoy programming and troubleshooting.  but i won't leave other
fields off my list either.  i want to be absolutely sure that i am going
to love what i will be doing for the rest of my life.  money is
important, but not as important as enjoying your career.

yeah, i hate the gen-ed, but i know i have to do it.  it is all a matter

[listen to me. dont be a dumbass. stay in school. this is the voice of
experience talking. i dropped out of case western in cleveland to be a
full-time raver...while i learned alot about myself and the world, its
next to
impossible to return to school once u leave...i left in 93 and i still am
trying
to finish up...its like bad medicine, you just got to bear down and take
it....putting it off makes it harder, not easier. id be mad at you if you
fucked up. :) its just a fucking piece of paper in a frame, but you are
fucked in terms of getting a job w/o a degree...and youll realise, it is
all
about money...yes you can do whatever you want, but its alot harder
without $$]

man, sometimes i think that is what i want to do, but then i was thinking
how much my life would suck if all i ever did was go from town to town
going to parties.  i'd get burned out in a month.  i plan on staying in
school, although there is so much bullshite involved with it.  props on
the bad medicine analogy, that is exactly how it feels.  but you see, i
know it sucks going down, but it can do nothing but good for you
afterword.  i may have to go part time next year due to money problems
and work, but i won't drop out.  i flunked out once already, and i am not
doing it again.  thanks for caring about me though, that says a lot. 
most people wouldn't give a fuck, but i guess that's why i don't hang
around with most people and like ravers so much. 8.]

you went to case western?  I almost went there.  i have a friend who goes
to john carrol and i wanted to get an apartment with him.  It would be so
nice to live in the city.  but things didn't pan out.  i got a few
friends that go to CMU, and i was thinking of transfering to Pitt so we
could all get an apartment (like a nice loft) and split it three ways.  i
would love to live in pittsburgh (i love the penguins).  it is one of my
favorite cities next to toronto and chicago.  the coolest thing is the
view of the city all lit up at night coming out of the ft. pitt tunnel. 
wow.  

plus, i'm sure you could tell me how phat the scene is in pittsburgh. 
i've only been in town for one event earlier this summer.

but enough, time to go to cs10051: intro to programming.  what a fun
class. x.P  at least it is easy 8.)

you know, when i said this, i didn't expect to become the most popular
man in the world, but

>> but what is a 'normal' life? 
>>all i know is that it is probably one in which i can't get stoned
>>everyday and roll every weekend like i do now.  and that sucks.

what this is saying is that i REALIZE that i can't do what i am doing now
for the rest of my life.  i know there will be a time in my not so
distant future when i have smoked my last spliff, popped my last pill,
and did my final dose.

now, the problem is that i am enjoying it way too much.

but first off let me begin by saying that i pay for my own school, pay
all my bills, and still live at home.  and no, none of the money i use to
pay for my ends comes from drug money.  but i supplement my meager income
from slaving in a kitchen all day with it, so i can go to parties and
purchase 'goodies' and feed my music addiction (400 cds and 80 vinyls
takes some green to accumulate).  i really don't think that there is
anything wrong with doing drugs as long as you control yourself.  the
only thing i do habitually is smoke weed.  but even that i can and have
stopped doing for long periods of time.  I hadn't smoked from januaray
til july of this year, i had a job that pulled RDTs.  but it seems that
not everyone has a favorable opinion of drugs and drug lifestyles, so
lets dispense with the formalities;

up until last year i was going to join the army.  i flunked out of
college and i had my scholarship revoked.  i thought the army would give
me self discipline i lacked because i would have someone kicking my ass
everyday.  but then i realized that if you can't motivate yourself, no
one else will.  so i had a change of attitude, a mental breakdown, and i
enrolled at a local community college branch of Kent State.  I decided
that i would learn about what i wanted to, but i know full well that what
i will do will involve computers, so i have an unofficial major of
computer science.  so far i am  maintaining a 3.0.  and guess what?  i
party more now than i ever did.  it is all about managing your time and
getting your priorities straght.  family is number one, but school is
number 2.  then comes partying and work.  and so what if some people have
it tough?  should i be grateful that i live in a country that has a
sespool of a society where everyone  engages in hedonism and the favorite
pastime for most people my age is getting drunk at some frat party and
fucking soriety girls?  i can't do anything about the circumstances i was
born into.  i didn't ask to be born in america, the 'promised land' or
whatthefuckever.  i'm sure my life would be very different if i were born
in the middle east.  but i wasn't, and i don't feel privileged about it
either.

what's so bad about 'shmokin' up'?  see, i don't see why other people
have to bitch about what people do in their own private time.  it sure as
hell doesn't affect other people, so if someone wants to light up a
spliff, snort a line, or shoot up some smack, the only person they are
screwing with is themselves.  it's a personal decision, and if you are
mature enough to handle it without getting carried away, then you can do
whatever you want.  but if you fuck up and do something stupid, like
overdose or mix shit that wasn't supposed to be mixed, then you have no
one to blame but your own self.  but i guess everyone has this picture of
a 'druggie' some lowbrowed dope who can't even remember his own name and
does nothing but leach of society.  it'd be nice if that were the case,
but i know a lot of fully functioning people in society who use drugs. 
the key word is USE, not ABUSE.

and another thing that pisses me off.  everyone is cool with binge
drinking and getting blitzed, yet there is such a stigma against
marihuana.  alcohol is ten times more addictive and will kill you a lot
faster, since the worst marihuana will do is give you lung cancer, and
that hasn't even been proven yet.  millions smoke tobacco even though
they know it will give them cancer and nicotine is 100 % addictive.  yet
all that shit is legal and the good green stuff isn't.  when will this
country get a clue.

i have one, and i use the library a lot.  but unfortunately, the libray

that would be my dream job, but how do i get my foot in the door?  music
production, hell, anything dealing with my biggest love in life
(MUSIC!!!!!! - not drugs) would be the proverbial 'shit.'

who are you to dictate what some ones goals ought to be?  everyone in
america has to fit some standard of yours in order to be deemed part of
society?  and why should i be ashamed of the fact that i do drugs?  i'm
proud of the fact i do, because it proves that i have balls enough to do
my own research, think for myself and choose the way i want to live my
life independent of what 'big brother' tells me to.  i don't do anything
because people tell me or want me to do it, i do what i want to, based on
my own thought processes.  i don't aspire to be a piece of shit, since
that is what you are thinking i am.  i don't want to be a bum that
doesn't work and resorts to begging or thievery so he can get a fix.  not
everyone who does drugs is a loser, and it is highly unfair to stereotype
people who do as a loser.  i have a job, i go to school, i pay my bills,
i do my work.  but i also like to kick back and have fun, and that is
what going to parties and drugs are for.  fun time.  they don't run my
life.

i am a wonderful, caring person.  i love my friends, i love people in
general, even people who do things to piss me off or people i view as
stupid.  i have a lot of hope that we will make it as a group, that we
will better ourselves and learn to love and live with one another.  my
main goal in life is to make myself the best i can be as a person, and of
course, to find true love 8.)  i am pretty idealistic too, especially
when i think that maybe if the scene does explode with popularity like
the music is about to do, that everyone will embrace the vibe and PLUR
can spread throughout the world, and we can all be a bunch of happy,
loving ravers. 

but what i don't see, is how drugs destroy this happy picture.  why are
drugs so negative?  i think that many drugs could be and are beneficial
to the users.  everytime i have tripped i have had some kind of
revelation, some enlightening new take on life.  i don't think any of my
experiences have deprived me of hope or love or anything that was
positive.  maybe you will understand, maybe you won't, but don't condemn
me for enjoying something you don't, or don't understand.  i know you
would ask the same of me.  and i would be happy to oblige 8.)

>PLUR!  
>(putting on her fire-proof suit?)

no need.  i know i got a little emotional in this post, but none of this
was personal or attacking either of your personalities.  i love and
respect both of you, and i hope i see you at an event soon.  we can share
some sweet tarts and play with glowsticks.  and hopefully, the next
discussion we have will be just as vigorous, but about which hardcore is
better, happy hardcore or gabber speedcore?

peace, love, and respect,

Pb-cle ravers - 

I thought I would let you see what I typed in reply to 

psilence303@juno.com (George T Murphy)
(however, this is getting personal and NRR, so I will probably not waste
your space with posting further personal messages!)

>who are you to dictate what some ones goals ought to be?  everyone in
>america has to fit some standard of yours in order to be deemed part of

Hello - 

Well, I actually do want to thank you for straightening all of that out.
>From the post we responded to, it actually seemed as if your aspirations
were no more than to lead a non-normal life that would allow you to use
drugs.  It was a very depressing thought, to be honest.  Yes, I suppose I do
think that it would be best if someone's goals were more than that. (This
may well be a personal hangup of my very own.)  I do not intend to meddle in
other people's lives, but it does make me sad to imagine. However!!!  your
recent mail has cleared that up.  It is clear that that you must be a
hardworking, interesting, cool raver extraordinaire with something to offer.
: )  My opinion is that is good.  It is only one opinion, and you do not
have to care about one opinion of someone across the country.  Of course I
have no illusions that everyone has to meet my approval to be part of
society!   I think it is quite a feat to go to school and support yourself too. 

Should you be ashamed of the fact that you do drugs?!!
No such thought entered my mind!  I have no problem with anyone using drugs
for their personal growth or pleasure, as long as it isn't seriously hurting
other folks.  I certainly do not condemn your use of drugs, and actually
admire your ability to be enlightened with each use.  If only we could say
the same for more things.  

...> we can all be a bunch of happy,
>loving ravers. 

Yessss!!  Sometimes as I drive down the road, I wish there were people on
all of the little hills, rocks, etc. jumping up and down and waving and
raving.  It's this weird vision of mine that comes from being at too many
outdoor events.

Ok, then, Friday down on Hollywood Boulevard?!  Electric Skychurch and some
moontribe DJ's are going to be there...!  No, well, maybe when I come back
east.  I was considering shake it in Dayton on the 20th of December, mostly
because it has good timing.  Are any of you listers going to be there?  I
would love to plan to meet some people rather than leave it up to luck.  

Oh, and Happy happy happy hardcore!!!! Wheee!!!!

     In relation to the scepticism surrounding the integrity and quality 
of the promoters of "Resolution", from my own observations Thursday, I 
think it's justified.  A group of people who I could tell weren't into 
the scene at all were passing out flyers for it.  I could see them 
thinking, "Man, we can really use this shitty-ass music to suck dry 
these little misled middle class kids."

be
performing/spinning at Resolution?  I really want to be there, but I also
wanna know who I am going to see. Thanks... Casey

Hello, i just talked to the promoter, all dj's are under contract
(written, legal)Paul Johnson and Strictly Jazz Unit,
Heather Heart & Rheade Truth, Hyperactive all will be there.

====================


whew, sounds like a mess :) and as much as i'd like to believe that 'they
will be there, they signed a contract' we all know certain artists have a
high degree of disregard for those things...esp. some of the ones listed
above...what promoter is actually going to take it upon themselves to hire
an attorney (esp. when they more than likely didn't make that much
money on the party) to try and sue a dj for breach of contract. not very
many....and to all those involved with resolution in akron, please don't
take this as 'spreading rumours' i'm just stating fact, based on past
observation.

a few weeks ago, i got to thinking, i've already explained the whole 'lack
of any decent parties in the area thing'...i was talking to andy/sine about
it, and after some thought (and seeing how well sessions turned
out)...we're gonna throw a new years eve party here in pittsburgh! :)

yeah, it's official.

it's gonna be a small scale, low key affair, so there won't be any drama
with any other parties, good luck to all. :)

this is gonna be a limited capacity ~300 person around $10 party RIGHT
HERE IN GOOD OLE PITTSBURGH! :) *hehe*

all we can offer you are talented djs (incl. a few out of town headliners)
dope ass *booming* sound by wizard workshop, wicked lights by the
same crew who ran them @ sessions, a *tight* vibe and lots of fun...:)

right now, we're still finishing up the lineup, we'll have the full lineup
released by Friday hopefully, pending confirmation from a few out of
town djs...

but i can release a portion of the confirmed lineup now...

most importantly...

**187 WILL BE PLAYING THE NEW YEARS EVE PARTY AND _NOT_
STEEL CITY JUNGLE ON THE 30TH** 

(we will be replacing his slot with another guest...;)

also, confirmed locals include:
---
dj sine (tagteaming on the mic with me during 187's set :)
dj squared
bob
---
and several more...i don't want to say, were talking to this person and
this person, etc...so just hang on til Friday, ok? :)

so...finally. a solution. u don't have to travel to south jersey (the armpit of
the east coast) and blow $60+ on a most likely soulless party (imo). u
won't have to waste your time driving to toronto, expecting a party at the
skydome, only to find out it's gonna be held in a club. or anywhere else.

if you are looking to ring in the new year with your friends (which really
is the most important thing about a nye party, not the 'big time' lineups) at
a *good* party, then consider this a formal invitation to join us in our:

Goddamnit.. get off of your high horse (pardon dem puns, son!!)
already.

Fucking hell.. how many times do I have to read about some spoiled brat
who thinks he's discovered the meaning of life through E and parties and
becomes the new self-appointed Pope of Rave.

Family first, school second... give it a rest.  You've slacked to
the point of being on the breach of joining the army, then joined a
classic "fuck-the-establishment-I-am-an-INDIVIDUAL" stance symbolent to
teenage rebellion.  That's just lovely that you like to smoke weed and
like to roll... WHAT DO YOU WANT, A COOKIE?  
 Tell me, have you ever thought that if you dedicated one ninth of the
amount of time to school work and family matters that you do to your 
enlightening emails justifying your life where you'd be?

WHAT WOULD THE LORD JESUS CHRIST THINK OF YOUR LIFESTYLE?!?

Watching Catholics fresh out of high school taking stands and justifying
"deviant" lifestyles is oh-so entertaining.

Yes there is a party on the 14 in Cleveland.  It is being thrown by Super
Dank (Just Dance was there fist party).  I think DJ Dan is booked for the
party also.

the fact that i enjoy drugs makes my life not normal.  i'd say i'd live a
pretty normal life if i didn't do them.  i have a job, i go to college,
i'm a family boy.  but i party a lot, and while going to parties is not
synonymous with drug usage, and vice versa, they compliment each other
well.  anyone that lives outside of societal norms must have something
subversive about their lives in order to do so.  drugs are illegal, that
makes my lifestyle subversive.  i don't worry about it much, though.  i
really don't feel like i am doing anything illegal.  it shouldn't be. 
but that isn't the only thing i enjoy about my non-normal lifestyle.  i
love the music, the scene, and i don't need drugs to enjoy that.  plus, i
have always been somewhat of a 'freak' anyway.  but if someone says they
do drugs, i guess everyone is going to have some connotation of some
pauly shore look alike with no brain.  and that's just not the case.

peace,

Just to reminisce,
I think the Sunshine Kids' first party was also my first party.  I was
told that Passion was their first party.  It was ....magical...teehee.  I
showed up in this weird outfit.  We're talkin' vinyl pants, silver
bustier, mesh top, Fluvog boots, long black pig tails, black raccoon
eye makeup.  Weird.  I saw this guy in a sky diving looking suit witha big
square bag.  I saw so many weird looking people.  It was wonderful.  The
lights were bright, the kids looked shady, everyone felt cool.  It was an
eye opening experience, obviously since I came back for more.  
All I remember is a continuous, pulsing beat, and colors, lots of colored
lights.  
When I came home I stripped off my putrid clothing and crawled into bed.
I was drenched in smoke and ck1 and shampoo smells and my eyes were full
of grit.  My ears rang.  I suppose you could call it orgasmic.  It was
very powerful.  On the way home I blew my vocal chords on Alanis
Morissette (she was very popular back then).  It was great.  I love raves.
I love the raves where I still feel like staying til sunrise.  
I feel so old, almost jaded.  I can be so bitter and cynical (thanks to
the bitter king, you know who you are).  At one point I started to look
upon the scene with disdain, that's not quite the right word, but the only
one that comes to mind at the moment.  It seems like I can't last two or
three hours without getting extremely sad.  Maybe it's just me.  I don't
know.  I miss my friends that have left for greener pastures.  I miss
anonymity while, at the same time, I rejoice in the friends I have left.  
I miss going to some kind of party at least once a month.  I miss going to
every party I hear about.  I've become a party snob in my education.  Am I
really old?
Oh well, that's my story, and I'm stickin' to it,
Jenifer Foulmood

Gotta agree here. drug dealing (and heavy drug use) at parties is
hurting the scene.

Here I must vehemently disagree. Shutting down the party is like
admitting that there were drugs there and that the drugs were totally
out of control. 

IMHO, the best way to handle that would have been to announce that drug
dealing and use would not be tolerated, ask everyone with drugs to
either leave or ditch the drugs, then proceed to do as thorough a search
as possible. This happened at a party I was once at. The cops came and
said they were coming back in XX minutes (which was pretty cool if you
think about it). If they found so much as one beer bottle or joint they
were shutting down the party. (Now really all that means is you have to
find the obvious stuff. If you can hide it good the cops prolly aren;t
going to body search everybodty. The promoters turned off the music for
45 minutes while they searched tents, cars and backpacks with a large
crew of ppl. Ppl were asked to voluntarily police their own areas. Alot
of beer bottles were collected, and of course, no drugs, but the cops
were impressed that we seemed as serious as them to get the illegal
stuff out. The cops looked around pretty thoroughly and then left us
alone the roest of the night. Better PR for the scene than shutting
down, and hopefully everyone learned a lesson about partying
drug/alcohol free. 

Now, I don't know the size of sessions, so I may be talking totally out
of my ass here, but admitting defeat is never a good course of action.
If my idea wouldn't work, surely there was a better way to handle it. 

What I do like is that the promoters seemed to make their decision very
thoughtfully, and for the right reasons. 

Does this make any sense??

I don't actually remember a time when I didn't know what I wanted to be
when I grew up.  I always wanted to be something.  First I wanted to be a
ballerina.  Then I wanted to be an artist.  Then I wanted to be an
astronaut.  Now I want to be an opera singer.  The difference between all
the other purposed careers and my present choice is that I'm really good
at what I do now.  If and when you chose a major, you should consider not
only what you're interested in, but what you're good at and are so
interested in that you want to do it for a very long time.  
My advice to you for the time being is to not waste your time putting off
the general ed stuff.  If you haven't already, get it all done and out of
the way.  That way, you'll have a lot of credits to use up for whatever
you choose to pursue.  
I believe that everyone should consider further education after high
school or the equivelant whether it's college, tech school, whatever.
Education will bring success.  "Smart is sexier than stupid anyday"  I
think that's the cheesy quote from "The More You Know".  Anyway, Good
Luck.  Live long and prosper!

That's understandable but a space like that that provides instaVIBE is
worth $$$ it.

I'm not doubting the fact that you did serve alot of time in the scene.
Your effort and persistance still resonates around the PGH area. The name
Sunshine Kids is synonomus(SP) with successful parties. You don't need to
tell me how much work is involved believe me I understand.

This is the third flier for NYE that Ihave seen him on.. Icincy and ST.
louis also)

>  forget the false rumors, pass it on  :) thanxs
I"m not trying to say that the above mentioned djs are no tgoing to be
there... its just well considering I have a few hmmm...suspicions...? its
entirely possible for djs to paly more than one party in a night... its
just I find it unlikely  especially on NYE....but that is once again just
my opinion.

tad



I don't know about the rest of the guys but I am doing all three.

I'm playing 11:00pm - 1:00am in Cincy in a tag team with Goodwill bringing
in the New Year.

Goodwill and I are then driving to St. Louis  and we are playing at around
8:00am and 9:00am in seperate sets.

I am then catching a flight to the Akron area and I'm playing around
12:00pm at their aferthours.

I'm gonna have to lug alot of tracks with me.   I want to try to play a
different style at each party.


Once again I'm not saying anything about this party because I don't know
what's on the other D.J.'s minds or the promoters minds but alot of D.J.'s
will play multiple parties on NYE.  Because of the the scope and exposure
of NYE parties alot of peolple want to use it to solidify their name/rep.
I will admit that is what I want to do by playing in three different
regions.  I love to spin and want to keep doing it.

One other thing is that I use my spinning to support my family too (along
with my full time job).  I want my son to have anything he needs.  I like
him to dress nice and look good.  I want him to have a large array of toys
to play with.  I want him to have the best of everything. I don't want him
to want for anything.  Spinning takes care of that. :)

Like I said earlier.  I am playing al three parties.  I don't know about
the rest of the D.J.'s though.

 Peace and Love

Flipmode = anal sex.  Furreal.  No Joke. Think about it. 

Sike, I ain't trying to get nasty.

Actually, I read something bout' Busta Rhymes where he sed "flipmode", as
in his "flipmode squad", was about looking at ting's from a different
perspective than what you'd expect - taking the flipmode of the norm.

That Busta...he's a pretty cool dude.

i don't see how that post was any different.  i don't feel like i have to
justify myself, but when people criticize me for using drugs, i get
emotional, because i don't think it is wrong.  i wasn't begging for
approval.  i really don't care.  i was making the point that because i
enjoy drugs, i will always be seen as living a deviant lifestyle.  i
don't think that that is a fair assessment, but if that's the way it is,
so be it.

peace to you.

i don't think i found 'the meaning of life.'  my experiences were good,
but not that good.  nor was i spoiled nor do i  think i am the 'pope of
rave.'  i find it funny you can make all these assessments when you don't
know me, or how i live.  i'm sorry if i came off too strong, but i was
simply defending my right to use drugs.  i wasn't condemning others, nor
was i trying to be arrogant.  i am sorry if i somehow offended you in any
way.  but you see, i don't need to justify myself to you, or anyone. 
think what you will.  i know that you'll always think you're the most
underground or hardcore or whatever that ill shit is.  i won't play those
games.  conformity, non-conformity, anti-conformity, whatever.  none of
that shit means anything, and you know it.  it's all about people.  i
like people, i like you.  i am sorry if i overstepped some line
somewhere.  it wasn't my intent to anger anyone.  i was stating opinion. 
that's it.  now, it's over.

please, the last time i was at church was when i was 4.  i never was a
goodie 2 shoes church boy, nor do i feel the need to rebel from that
persona.

If you're thinking of the whole Radio Free Berkeley case, I'm familiar
with that.  However, the FCC DID bust a pirate station in Minneapolis,
Beat Radio, which was very similar to Carson in what they played.  The
FCC "got smart" and, instead of taking legal action, seized the
transmitter.  Now, a driving factor behind the bust was a complaint from
another, FCC sanctioned, radio station with a close frequency (97.5 and
97.7).  Oddly enough, this station is around 70 miles from where The
Beat was, and it seems unlikely that a 10 Watt station would present a
problem.  Regardless, they were shut down.

Anyway, just want to make sure that our foes at the FCC didn't decide
whats best for Pittsburgh.

mea culpa!		(my fault!)
Mea Culpa!!!		(My Fault!!!)
MEA *GRAN* CULPA!!!!	(MY *BIG* FAULT!!!!!)

Ok, I'm sorry if I offended anyone by unwittingly sparking a
religion-related thread.  I grew up Catholic and I think Catholicism is
really funny.  Catholics are even funnier.  We have such strange and
distinct idiosyncracies. 

I'm being very flippant about a serious subject, but I really didn't mean
to be offensive to my Catholic brothers and sisters or any of the other
pegans--I mean people--on this list. ;). Pointing out my own flaws, joking
about them and pinning them on my religious upbringing is a way to
alleviate guilt.  See how tangled up it all is?  :)  An interesting point
about the habit of Catholics joking about themselves though, besides
obviously being a form of self-degradation as well as self--glorification
and identification I guess, is that for me anyway, it was the strongest
culture I had influencing me when I was young.  My dad's central american
but I only got parts of that culture and in subtle ways.  I didn't grow up
urban or suburban or rural or really much of anything.  But I know all the
history, oral tradition (rote prayers) and all that other stuff that goes
along with american roman catholic culture.

Ok, that's enough.  I really didn't want to spawn another off-topic thread
and I kinda hope no one else continues it.  :)  But I did want to
apologize.

Sister Mary Stephanie

Eh, he just left for Israel (yes, Steph is once again in beaming
girlfriend mode) but I, as a trained representative of Joe's Brain, will
explain the sitch as I know it.

Hossam, you would have been correct in sayign that chances of being busted
were slim, or appeared so.  But in the past few weeks there have been
several busts, and the pirate up the street from me and Joe here in Philly
had the FCC come to their door.  They'd been asking for confrontation for
years and they finally got their 15 minutes.  There's a girl on NE raves
involved in the station (WPPR I think) and she would know details.
Anyway, they had a demonstartion and everything.  If Mark knows this, he
may just be laying low.

The background is this:  Since the feds cut budgets, the FCC has been
slacking.  They simply can't pay for all the monitoring they used to do.
Also they're getting less and less popular (see the very kind article in
the Pittsburgh Tribune-review several weeks ago that featured Mark and
Radio Carson.

So pirates have been acting up a bit, knowing the chances are slim they'll
get caught.  Add that to the fact that Steven Dunifer, the guy behind the
Free Radio Berkely battle just won some stage of legal action.  It was a
big shot in the arm for unlicensed radio.  This may have caused too much
blatent activity and perhaps the FCC wanted to prove that yes, they are
still around and will still bust you.  That's my take on it, anyway.  Joe
understands the details much better.

I think it's very unlikely Mark got busted.  He knows what he's doing (we
have one of the legendary radio gurus, Boomer, right in pittsburgh.  He
really has done a lot in and for radio and is well-respected for it) plus
he has a lot of community suppoHere's hoping everything's ok, but even if
he did get busted he'd be alright.

Give him a call at 488.8702 if you want to see what's up.

Sorry folks, I mis-quoted earlier.  It should have been:

Jesus says, "Come on Kringle, I'll buy you an orange smoothie."

Kringle replies, "ooh."

I'm catholic and i do believe that my religion is a little hypocritical
too.  I just don't like people bashing anyone, unless it's jew bashing. 
Just kidding!  :)

>> as far as the fcc busting him, unlikely...i'll have our resident

i remember back in the day someone saying something about how pittsburgh
has so many hills, that (as well as making it hard to ride a bike :) the
feds couldn't even tell where the signal was coming from, and therefore
couldn't bust ya. any truth in that?

O.K. so maybe I wasn't paying attention, but can anybody tell me anything
about the NYE party that 187's going to be at in Pittsburgh.  I feel like
that kid with her eyes on the swingset on the playground just outside the
window in first grade.  Your information could make the difference between
a five hour trip to Baltimore and staying here in the 'burgh!

while i know this is far from us, geographically, it seems to me that
whatever happens to free radio berkeley at this point will set a
precedent potentially important to the fate of Carson
i got these articles from http://www.freeradio.org/
you can also find Wilken's full decision there


ANOTHER VICTORY FOR FREE RADIO BERKELEY & MICROPOWER BROADCASTING

At 7 PM on Wednesday, November 12 attorneys for Stephen Dunifer & Free
Radio Berkeley received a 14 page decision via fax from Federal District
Court Judge Claudia Wilken announcing her ruling in favor of Stephen
Dunifer and Free Radio Berkeley.  Her ruling denies the FCC's motion for
summary judgement for a permanent injunction, states that she has
jurisdiction in this case and that the FCC's regulatory structure is
unconstitutional.  Further, she orders the FCC to submit within 14 days a
brief on the constitutional issues raised.  Essentially Judge Claudia
Wilken affirms all the merits and arguments raised by the defense
attorneys for Stephen Dunifer and Free Radio Berkeley. 


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 20

FCC RESPONDS TO MICROPOWER BROADCASTING 
COURT VICTORY
WITH  A SWAT TEAM 

One week after Federal Judge Claudia Wilken refused to grant the FCC a
permanent injunction to shut down Free Radio Berkeley and ordered the FCC
to respond to specific Constitutional questions, the response came not in
the form of legal brief as requested but in the form of a SWAT team
busting down the door of Tampa, Florida micropower broadcaster Doug
Brewer.  At 6 a.m. Wednesday, November 19 Doug Brewer and his wife were
visited in their home by a 20 person Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force
(comprised of Federal Marshals, a SWAT team, local police, Customs, and a
self-identified CIA agent) led by the FCC.  With automatic weapons trained
on them they were ordered to the floor where they were handcuffed face
down with gun muzzles at their head.  For the next 12 hours they were
detained in their own home, not even allowed to go to the bathroom alone,
while agents stripped their home of anything remotely related to radio
transmission equipment.  Police cordoned off the block around their home,
the site of the micropower broadcasting station, and brought in a crane to
dismantle his broadcasting tower. 

At the same time other members of the same task force were busy shutting
down two more micropower broadcasting stations in the Tampa area.  One
man, Loni Kobres, was taken to jail and not released until he signed
papers agreeing not to take any action to recover equipment which had been
seized.  Radio X had its equipment seized as well with one of its members
spending a brief time in jail. 

Commenting on this latest development, Stephen Dunifer of Free Radio
Berkeley, said: "This certainly shows that the FCC has nothing but
contempt for due process and the Bill of Rights.  It is clear that the FCC
is carrying out its marching orders given to it earlier this year by the
National Association of Broadcasters who have begun a search and destroy
campaign against micropower broadcasting. " 
 
Speaking for SF Liberation Radio, Richard Edmondson stated: " The raid
against Doug Brewer and other microbroadcasters in Florida, coming as it
has just a week after the Federal Court ruling in California, is a display
of lawless thuggery which demonstrates to me more clearly than ever that
the US Government does not care about its own courts, its own laws, or its
own Constitution." 

In response to this latest attack on micropower broadcasting Bay Area
micropower broadcasters will be holding a press conference and Free Speech
support demonstration at the Oakland Federal Building on Tuesday, November
25 at 5 PM. 

Background material on the legal case and micropower broadcasting is
available on the following WEB sites:  www.368hayes.com,
www.freeradio.org, www.radio4all.org.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

ARG!!!!  I've been hearing "back in the day" stories since I was a raver
knee high to phat pants about DJ Deadly Buda and NOW I'm not even going to
be in town for the 26th.  Go ahead and just ask me about how rotten I feel
about this timing.  Keep in mind I'm not blaming anything but cruel fate.
My rave life should be a freaking opera!!  Arg!!!!  I've always wanted to
hear him spin thanks, to the Bitter King and now I can't, thanks to
pre-planned holiday activities!!  Damn the holidays dammit!!!!!  Well at
least I get to go to two, count'em, two Steel Cities and I might even get
to go to the NYE party with 187.  I suppose that's some consolation...but
dammit arg.  I can only hope that he, too, will be rescheduled for NYE.
Oh well, I'm off to sulk.  
Jenifer very Foulmood

Just a lil' interesting tidbit - just read on the Drum & Bass Areana
site that jungle producer Mickey Finn turned down 10k pounds to do a
jungle remix of the hit "Tubthumping" by Chumbawumba.

DAMN!

Major respect to Mickey for having that kind of integrity.

Come on, admit it, we ALL understand this list!!
Jenifer Foulmood 


Okay, okay.  This is long, but it's also amusing.  


YOU MIGHT BE A COLLEGE STUDENT...
If you have ever price shopped for Top Ramen
If you live in a house with three couches, none of which match
If you consider Mac and Cheese a balanced meal
If you have ever written a check for 45 cents	
If you have ever seen two consecutive sunrises without sleeping
If your glass set is composed of McDonald's Extra Value Meal
	Plastic Cups (i.e. Olympic Dream Team I or II)
If your underwear supply dictates the time between laundry loads
If you cannot remember when you last washed your car
If you can pack your worldly possessions into the back of a pick-up
	(one trip)
If your bed time is no longer 10:00 PM, but 3:00 AM
If you consider Pizza one of the four major food groups.
If you consider the other three to be pop, McDonalds, and candy.
If you've ever missed a class to watch Ricki Lake.
If you've ever sent e-mail to the people you live with.
If you refer to your meal card as "plastic".
If you've ever spent a good hour searching for your student
	I.D. just so you could get that one dollar off at the movies.  
If you've ever stayed up all night just so you wouldn't sleep through your
	morning class.
If you've ever called home just to talk to your pets 
If you watch TV with no volume, while listening to the radio 
If you can play euchre in any state of mind
If showering doesn't happen on a daily basis
If a blender is your first major appliance  
If you're not a dork if you wear your backpack on both shoulders
If weather begins to be a major factor on your class attendance
If you would rather do e-mail than study for a test 
If your second major appliance is a coffee maker  
If you spend a majority of your time reading forwarded mail

  - you bring home a doggie bag from Taco Bell.
 
  - a peanut butter and jelly burrito is considered a valid nutritious
    breakfast.
 
  - you're always there if the words "free food" are mentioned.
 
  - hitchhiking across America sounds like an "educational experience" (or
    at least that's what you tell your Mom).
 
  - a "rich date" is someone who takes you to the real movies, not just
    the free ones shown on campus.
 
 - you know (and employ) more ways to waste time than there are dollars
   in your bank account.
 
  - you know more about TV shows than about your assignments.

  - you go trick-or-treating for next week's breakfast.
 
  - you drag clothes out of your hamper to wear (on a regular basis).
 
  - you rewrite all the cliches and songs you know because you discover
    that they fit your dormroom life (or lack thereof).
 
  - you can think of at least 4 different ways to wear your underwear to
    avoid having to do laundry.
 
  - you think you're rich if you've got a positive checking balance
 
  - other people drive your car more than you do
 
  - you can fall asleep ANY time, ANY where
 
  - you make change for a quarter when you need to make a phone call
 
  - you have week-old pizza in your refrigerator and you contemplate
     eating it

  - you'd rather eat off a piece of paper than wash your dirty dishes
 
  - you have a pile of dirty clothes, a pile of once-used but not quite
    dirty and clothes, and a pile of clothes used more than once but
    that you could use a couple more times without smelling too bad...

Good for him!  I can't stand Chewythumpawumba.  Of course most
alternative music sucks anyways.  He probably didn't want to stoop that
low to do a remix for them.  I wouldn't either.

Im burning some cd's for some local Dj's and my program sucks, it cant
handle any continuous mix over 20mins and I want to break the session into
smaller ones, right now I digically record right from turn-tables and I
have to stop them every 20 mins (about 1/2 gig)to clean it up. I'm using
the same program the smashing pumpkins recorded siamese dreams with and it
cant handle it does anyone have a clue?

just curious here...is Sub Base USA actually around?  I take it that
they're related to SubBase UK.  however SB UK has recently given up on

hey...

 

i already explained the situation surrounding the 'sessions' party on
12/6...the police paid a visit to the owner of the space later in the week,
and cautioned him on any future 'incidents' like our friend from cleveland
was a part of...the owner of the space is not cool with another event
that soon (new years eve) and so regrettably we have the cancel the
small party we had planned....my deepest apologies and a big 'thanks a
lot motherfucker' goes to the genius from cleveland...


the owner of the space has agreed to more parties at the space
however, (he likes them, he just thinks the timing is too soon)...the next
scheduled sessions party will be on February 14, it will be called 'love'

the steel city jungle update is this:

 
187 is rescheduled for scj 12/30...confirmed lineup is:



andy/sine opening up
187 live pa (1 hr)
jeffee from orlando spinning til close (either 2 or 3 am)

 

so, those of you looking forward to hearing 187 will not be
disappointed...:)

 

also, don't forget candlelight on 12/26...with old school legend deadly
buda :)

 

email for more info on the various nye parties going on in the area, i'll
be more than happy to supply you with the details (toronto, milwaukee, nyc,
akron), or you can sit and chill and pop the cork with your friends, cause
above all else, that's the most important aspect of nye (to me): ringing in
the new years surrounded by the people you love.



again, my sincerest apologies...personally, it was really hard news for
me to take.

 

 

peace + big respects,
hossam

If you're thinking of the whole Radio Free Berkeley case, I'm familiar
with that.  However, the FCC DID bust a pirate station in Minneapolis,
Beat Radio, which was very similar to Carson in what they played.  The

[well, as i'm sure you know, it was nothing more serious than a melted
capacitor...but the cases i'm referring to are ones that joe told me
about...involving busting up a station run by a blind preacher in indiana,
who was operating a 99w station in the middle of nowhere, usa, and a
few others...incl. i think the off shore pirate near new york city...when
joe comes back, maybe steph can have him respond...]

peace,
hossam

p.s. Too bad about the New Years party, I was really, really, really
looking forward to that... so what's going to be the 'out of city' party
of choice now for New Years?

your outta ram.. or your using a PC with windows.. just my opion..
i'd say don't mess with over 10mins of stereoCD sound unless you have
atleast..
a powermac with automationII sudio card. and 32megs of ram.. even then having
128 megs would be better.. =)
OR you could record to DAT, then just AES/EBU transfer to your CD writing
through your computer..you wouldn't need to play the sample [i think]

Joe has told me that as well.  Pittsburgh apparently has a grand tradition
of pirate radio because of that.  I think I remember Joe telling me that
at one time there were like 7 pirates.  

There's plenty of info on the net about pirate radio.  There's also at
least one newsgroup.  I think it's alt.radio.pirate or rec.radio.pirate or
something like that.

Did you hear that one of the guys from the band got taken in by police in
italy for wearing a skirt?  Mayb that`s my mickey didn't do it.  And maybe
why goldie hates tricky so much...

funny off-topic story about Chumba...a co-worker of mine had a little
peice of colorful paper taped to her 'puter that said "I get knocked
down...  -Chumbawumba"  Now, I had never heard of them, and knowing this
friend of mind, I figured Chumbawumba was a cartoon character or
something.  I had this image of a chubby, high-voiced yellow and pink bear
scowling endearingly at the evil work all around, determined to win in the
end. I was very disappointed to find that C. is a Madmess-meets-Kate Bush
sound-alike pop band, and not chubby at all. 

I learned who nine inch nails was similarly.  Back in high school all the
cool kids were wearing NIN shirts.  I knew it had to refer to something
and I figured it was a band.  So I did some research and found out about
Anaiis Nin.  I started reading her stuff and went into school one day all
starry-eyed and breathless from the delicate, creamy poetry of it all.  I
went up to one of my cool-kid friends and said, "Tim!  Do you know what
NIN means???" I was hoping it was a group just as delicate and poetic.
"Yeah," he says. "Nine Inch Nails."  

And my poetic beach ball deflated and slumped on the floor in the hall.  I
just kind of walked away.

ok.. as a muscian i have to speak.. lets say someone remixed some
chumawnamskaiusdiljsd.. do they instantly become lame? 
only if they sell out doing it. then still.. producers gotta eat.. how long do
you think 10Uk would last if your a techno head.? half a year? 
if some one remixed chumbaswaljasdiasd but did it there way.. they deserve
100% respect for making it, and being reconized. people [ravers] have to get
off there underground high hoarse's and respect the producer's. 
its amazing the lack of support from the techno scene to the producers.. i've
been working alot recently with VapourSpace, and hes out promoting his new
album [and label] and he's getting Shit! cause of all this stuff hes doing for
AMP..
but he hasn't even sold out, his shit is His.. 100% hes just trying to promote
it the best he can..
it wack when people dislike a muscian cause they are trying to live... let the
music speak.. not weather who they know or work for is underground enuff for
you.

thats all i've gotta say

What program are you using?   Are you ok with memory?  What does the
program do after 20 minutes?  Could you go to DAT and then to disk?  

I don't do much computer/sound stuff so I'm no expert, but I've used
Steinberg Wavelab (a very good program in the same family as Avalon and
Cubase) and it worked pretty well for me.  It's a non-destructive editing
program and I'm still not totally straight on what that means or why it's
imprtant, even though it's been explained to me at least twice.  (thick
skill)  Anyway, it's disk-based which means you only really need 8 mbs of
RAM, or so says the booklet, and the rest is done with virtual memory and
disk space I guess.  (It's native to windows 95 which supposedly uses
"virtual memory".  Toby: what's the difference between 95 virt mem and
unix vir mem?  how bout nt?) It also has unlimited undo and redo which is
really nice.  The file itself only changes when you hit save. 

Well, the long and short of it is that I had problems recording more than
about 17-20 minutes worth of stuff until I completely defragged the disk. 
First I did it from windows and that didn't seem to help much.  Then I did
it from ScanDisk from DOS and that did the trick. (Well, to tell you the
truth, Toby/Farmer Tea did it for me when I was frustrated almost to
tears. Thanks, Toby.  ;)  At least I think that's what did it. 
Regardless, after that I could record as long as I wanted.  I was easily
doing 45-50 minute files.  There was the rare pop or momentary dropout,
and I don't know if that came from the program, the machine, or the sound
card.  

Anyway, hope this helps a little and as I said, you could always just
record the whole set onto DAT, then dump 20 minute chunks onto your
computer with like 30 seconds of overlap so you can match up the files and
sew them together (hopefully) seamlessly. 

Good luck.

this post is to clarify some points re: upcoming "XMAS BREAKS" event.

recently a concerned friend wrote me re: "XMAS BREAKS"...

> elecctronica event?
> 
> Do you have a spare ziplock I can puke in?
>

the "Manny" to whom this friend refers is Manny Theiner, longtime 
Pittsburgh underground xpr+rock+jazz concert promoter and music journalist
for In Pittsburgh newsweekly. He, of late, has become interested in this
whole "electronica" aka Techno/Drum+Bass/DJ Culture thing.

Manny has long been known for his knack of rubbing people the wrong way. 
This effect of his may now include some people of the Pittsburgh rave/dj
culture scene.

I want to clarify Manny's involvement with this event. He did not "co-opt"
"my" event. Manny+Tcrps are co-producing "Xmas Breaks."

It goes like this: I had interest in doing a pittsburgh event featuring 
MUTAMASSIK over Xmas break. I had talked to some other people of the local
scene(s) about finding a space, with no results. I mentioned this to
Manny. He had connections with a virgin (to DJs) space, primely located. I
said, super, it's on. 

Manny is also helping to promote this event. There will be articles in
IN PITTSBURGH and THE POST GAZZETTE. The target audience of both articles
will, no doubt, be much broader than we D-L peeps on the scene(s) (whether
we jungle or techno or rave culture or all) for all these many years.
No doubt, both articles may use many stomach-churning buzzwords in an
attempt to interest+attract suburban middle-aged types and the like.
Some of them may come or they may not. No doubt if u down, one can ignore
such articles (or laugh at them) and come to cool down-low events, like
tcrps/fila events, anyhoo. 

Personally, I think diversity is good in a crowd. Hopefully, the people
who attend "XMAS BREAKS", now matter how "down" or "up" they may be, will
enjoy at least some, maybe all, of the sounds, the visuals and
contribute to a positive warm + peaceful vibe. Happy Xmas. Jolly
Channakah. Yippe Sparkle Season. Joyous Kwanza. Wonderful Winter Equinox,
etc.

I will personally instruct Manny to leave his buzzwords at the door.

Love,
-->Edgar Ummm-Tcrps [Tcrps/Fila, etc. 1998]

Thanks for the info steph and everyone who replyed i guess i should have
been alittle more clear on my problem. I have over 64megs of ram and i can
use 128 if i need it but the problem im having is, im producing some live
mixes straight from turn tables so i need to clean it up before i burn it
to a cd. The program im using right now which i pirated from a friend who
works at a sound studio cant handle one 74min track it was meant for 15min
max. If i use a dat it merges the static and the music together making it a
royal pain in the ass to work with. I talked to a friend who does stuff for
Hypnotic but he doesnt know dick about pc enhancing, just studio
remastering BS, does that Steinburg Wavlab use cif. files or just wavs?

Yes-- it's really quite confusing.  Sessionz has been going strong in
Boston for a year now under the new monkier (formerally Jungle Roots, and
for a while, The Jiggley Room).

Not to claim "firsts", but it really is confusing, especially for flyer
and email readers.

interested in getting some time in and hopefully a finished product.
Anyone interested should check out the website regrading what's in
here,etc...

I'm also setting up a section on graphics soon from a couple of requests,
anyone interested in flyers, jcards, etc. can let me know.

I'm heading up to New York soon, so anyone from that area want to get
together and/or show me around PLEASE let me know.  Also if you have tapes
and stuff please get them to me to take up there.  Hopefully I will be
playing in N.Y. and in Pittsburg

No.  You can really only judge a producer's 'lameness', by what they
produce...if Mickey Finn did a good/creativ remix of the tune that's so
lame, Id respect him all the more.  If all he did was a 'junglization' of
the tune with levi-commercial beats, i'd have to give him the jeers.

I really only meant to give him props for turning it down because of the
symbolism of the thing...I'd have done it in a second as long as i had
full creative control.

I buy more records/cds from producers i like than mixtapes of djs playing
them, and i always try to go to events with live pas/djs who produce...but
there's always that sad aspect of reality where really good stuff is never
reccognized until its way too late.

True true true...but often the super-rich (chumbawumpa) are just trying to
use the super talented (finn) to cash in on a cool trend (jungle).  At
least that's what people see it as.  In the long run he should'v just
taken the money, done a track, and then used the money to push his stuff
that much farther.  But the truth is, he didn't do it just because he
didn't think it would make a good translation to jungle.

Yes Doc Scott has been around for ages.  Co-founder of the Metalheadz label
and the one with the craziest Dubplate selection. The hits like; Surgery,
Here come the Drumz,Shadowboxing,Unofficial Ghost,Swarm,Da Cause, and the
list goes on.   Known as King of the Rollers, He is rated one of the top
producers and Djs in the current DrumandBass stable.  You thought
Grooverider,LTJ Bukem,and Peshay was tight check out Scotty as he rolls it
out for the Sessionz crew.

Will be coming to Boston for an EXCLUSIVE appearance.   He is going to spin
an extended set.  From what I know  he is ONLY playing in Boston for this
quick stop in the U.S.. So if you are coming from somewhere else it will be
a treat before spending time at home for the holidayz.   We are tripling
the soundsystem for those who like the Bass churning buziness.

Doors open at 10pm
 He is slated to go on at 12:00 am

Sessionz happens every Sunday nite.   Strictly Drum and Bass.  With the
best of U.K. talent guests.  Coming up in January  Dj Randall with MC Fats.

ok, so my friends and I went to NATO last night and here's the scoop...
the sip cafe has a real mellow atmosphere (read: no dancing)
the place is small & quaint... a nice place to chill...
strange sets, from ambient/illbient to almost slammin house...
this is a good place to go eat a piece of cake with a friend, but don't
expect the place to be slammin

get Session 8 or CAkewalk pro.; seesion 8 is meant exclusively for audio
recording and cakewalk is a combination of that and a midi sequencing
program.

I think one thing that a lot of people don't understand very well is that
once an artist signs onto certain priveleges, with a manager or a record
label, for example, they also sign away a certain amount of control.  When
they agree to give the responsibility for promotion, hundreds of
long-distance phone calls, a lot of connections and great negotiation
skills, to someone better equipped to do it themselves, they are giving
these people the right to make some decisions for them.  Depending on the
people and the motivations, these may be very much inthe artist's interest
or not so much in their interest.

What I'm saying is that it may or may not have been Chewbacca's decision to
ask Mickey Finn for a remix.  Similiarly, it may or may not be Rusted
Root's decision to hardly touch Pittsburgh anymore.  They are no longer in
it for themselves.  Their record company and whatever has a stake, a large
stake, in their career.  They invested in it, to put it simply, and in
return, they get to make some decisions about how its run.

How much an atrist's career is manipulated wackly has a lot to do with the
kind of people he or she has signed papers with, and what the papers
contain.  Managers, for example, are in the busniness of making money for
their artists, and then they get a cut.  In most cases, keeping the
artist's underground integrity in tact is not the manager's highest
priority.  Sting aparently had a problem where "don't stand too close to
me" was used ina commerical without his consent, but with the consent of
his publisher, or manager or soemthin, at the time the song was made.  He
went to court over it and everything, but he lost the case.  When he
signed, it probably looked like he was getting a good deal.  Hey, these
people are going to pay me to make an album and promote it and
everything...all I have to do is sit back and make the best, most creative
album I can...Right?  Well, there you have it.  No free lunch.

Add that to the fact that less experienced musicians are very easy to f**k
over.

Anyway, I'm not saying that I really want to see a mickey finn remix of
Ch....a, (alhtough look at all the decent mixes dillinja does...).  I'm
only pointing out that when an artist takes heat for doing something dumb,
it's probably more often than not soemthing that the artist particularly
wanted to do.

Oh well.  Carry on.

Hey everybody, well, I'm assuming you remember the whole "This isn't
crack . . . its white rock opium!" incident.  And remember how nobody
believed that there was such thing as white rock opium?  Well, I recently
saw a LARGE bag of white-rock opium.  So I guess there is something
caleld white opium . . . unless it was a large bag of clear/white rock
candy all crushed up.

if youre using a mac, get Sound Designer II, Protools, or Digital Performer.

if your using a PC, use Cakewalk Pro or Session 8.

these are the respected programs in the bizness for digital recording.
there are millions of shareware programs you can find that record audio
files. i suppose they could be worth a shot. all i know is that on
Macintosh the PowerPC outs get distorted really easily, so getting a sound
card doesnt hurt.

what you want to do is record your files directly on to a hard disk, so you
dont have to worry about your ram stopping you from recording a continuous
mix.if you dont have enough space on the hard disk, then i suggest getting
a Zip drive, or a Syquest drive. IF yoo have the money, the JAZZ drives for
Mac hold 1 GIG of memory in each cartridge;

other forms of digital recording; DAT machine, Sony Minidisc.

good luck,

 pete sysko

Woo hoo, once again, I flex vicarious knowledge, siphoned off by watching
Joe work.

He has had really bad luck with Syquests.  He has bought 2 of them, from
different dealers, and both has a nasty habit of not spinning up when
they're supposed too...like on stage with scores of eager eyeballs waiting
for a performance to start... ;)

He roughs up his equipment, moving it around and stuff, but he got a zip
drive over the summer and it has served him flawlessly.  It's also much
smaller, more efficient (only spins when it needs to spin, takes a second
or two longer to access a file than the 270 mb syquest), and has cuter
software and packaging.  :)

If you want to go into the JAZ range and you've had better luck with
syquests, (JAZ is made by Iomega, the Zip people) Syquest is now making a
1 gig or so drive for the same price range as a Zip.  I don't think a scsi
version is available yet. 

Aw yeah, watch as pb-cle morphs into alt.dork.techhead...

steph

I went to Soul Pollination on saturday night and had a killer time.
This is the first party I've been to from Bee Happy Productions and I
thought they did a great job-no shady bullshit to deal with from
security, re-entry, you had to buy water bottles, but nothing's purfect.

If anyone from the company is on the list It'd be great to know if you
have any other events in the works.  Also I'm curious as to the official
number in attendence-I was guessing around 500, just about right for the
venue size.

Maybe some other people in the Cleveland area should take a hint from
the response this upstart got and stop charging $20 bucks for small
parties (Soul Polination was about $12)  I think it makes a big
difference in accessability--we need to keep getting new people into the
scene and how many new people are going to spend $20 bucks to go to
something they're not sure of.  Shit, I know I can't afford $20 a pop.

PLUR

on the small(er) artists remixing larger artists, roni size has recently
remixed U2 (i think it's called "mofo" and it's rather boring, i think),
and i think armand van helden remixed the rolling stones, (although i'm
not quite sure) but i do know that he did refuse to answer a phone call
from mick jagger.

and in my opinion, mickey finn sold out a long time ago and it wouldnt
have mattered if he had remixed that band b/c it would have sounded like
every other track he's made in the past 2 years (same with aphrodite).

cheers!

> I've had enough schoolwooork this week to deal with more history.

me too...i worked all day + all night thurs on 2 sculptures, borrowed my
roommate's camera to take slides of everything i made this semester, took
them to get developed, wrote a paper, got my slides back which
miraculously came out ok, submitted the slides + my paper, went to work,
ate something for the 1st time in about 24 hrs + came home + finally got
some sleep. then i had to go straight back to work, then straight to the
studio + worked nonstop all night for 12 hours to finish another project,
got a little more sleep, then i had to work all night (at work) again last
night. now i have 2 more (1 page fortunately) papers due tonight + 2
entire projects due tomorrow, none of which i've started. this sucks. this
is total insanity. i can't wait for the break: all the sleep + food i
want.

It's like 6/day :P  Goto http://www.hyperreal.org/ , there should be a FAQ
lying around .  You must understand, we cannot simply tell you how to do it.

Pardon my ignorance, but is Dieselboy producing now?  I've seen various
posts on newsgroups that seem to indicate that he's actually a producer.
 If so, this would be news to me.

Alrighty.  There seems to be a strange misunderstanding about how
listservs work.  When you write to list, you are sending a message to
everyone on that list.  The robot that recieves your message and sends it
out to everyone signed up to recieve it, isn't trained to read it,
understand it, or do anyhting else with it other than re-distribute it.
Like a postal worker.  You put your letter in the mail, and the post
office sends it where it's s'posta go.  they do read your mail...yet.

However, there's another robot, who lives at a very differnt address than
the postal-worker robot.  This robot is a REQUEST robot.  It's job is to
read your message, and if it sees key words like "subscribe" or
"unsubscribe" it goes ahead and does it.  It's kinda like calling customer
service.  When the rep hears, "I want to check my balance," the rep looks
that up in th computer.  Similarly, when the robot hears "unsubscribe," it
unsubscribes you.

So you see, if you want to unsubscribe from a list, you need to find the
address of the request robot.  All you need to do is hop on the old web,
and look up the web page that features the list you're trying to get off
of.  It will tell you exactly what to do.

All you accomplish from sending unsubscribe messages to the list itself,
is *annoying other list members with your laziness*.  Unless, of course,
the robot is broken which happens sometimes, in which case, Trouty is to
be blamed for any annoyance incurred.  ;)

Tonight, Tuesday, December 16, 1997

Steel City Jungle in conjunction with BulletProof Productions brings
you....

    Phantom 45 (Sub Base, USA) -

Hailing from Chicago, Phantom is one of the U.S.'s premiere drum n' bass
DJs.  Phantom brings his bag of mixing tricks and scratches to Steel City.

Along with hometown DJs -

    Bricks (Cold Krew, Pgh)

    Sine (Steel City Jungle, Pgh)

If you feel Steel City has been slowing down as of late, we've just been
scraping our pennies to bring you this one....(check out our review in the
new issue of Mixmag magazine, page 68).

And, remember, Steel City Jungle takes place every other Tuesday night at
Laga, above the
Attic on Forbes Ave. Oakland.

Admission is $5 US, all ages (open bar for those of age).  There are drink
specials running until midnight.

Doors open at 10:00 pm.
Questions?  Dial 412-761-8173.

Hope to see you there.

Dave
(if you do go, come up and say hi to me.  i'll be the fat guy with the huge
head and big, black-rimmed glasses).

hello all,
   just letting everyone know that i'll be away from my computer until
january 12th or so for christmas break.  this means that i won't be able
to check email or update my web page.  and THAT means that i won't be
able to take any orders for "before, after, then".  the freeness of the album
normally would have came to a close at the end of '97, but since i'm gonna
be away, i'll be extending it until i get back on the 12th...  sooooo,,,if you 
send an email order before i get back, i'll honor it.  
    i'm not sure how i'm going to work the sales of the album after that.
i want it to be as free as possible, but quite frankly, i'm very much in 
debt.  and the next album is nearing completion....so i'll think about that 
over break.  if anyone has any suggestions, mail them to me.
    if you would have to reach me by fone, you can do so at this number:
(412) 869-0908

thanks, and i'll talk to you all next year.

love,                     p.s. - njoi your druid tree worshipping this
holliday...
ryu

While we're sending warnings about bogus drugs:

  Don't buy acid in Annapolis as it is mostly undipped blotter.
  Use care when buying licks as Ketaset isn't what it used to be!

My 2 cents worth.

I don't know, that strongly depends on what dru gz you choose to use. If 
you stick with psychedelics you are likely to explore new frontiers while 
conserving your wallet. Me th and friends are more likely to explore your 
wallet rather quickly as they are very much subject to the law of 
decreasing returns. I stay wired on chai and coffee, which doesn't mean I 
look down on those who'd rather lick spe ed paste off their fingers. 
Those new and confused in the scene should be advised to be careful 
though. Substance dependance has a way of sneaking up on you. Been there 
and done that believe me.

On that subject: I have heard that the lieklyness of becoming dependant 
on a substance is highly linked to the time period between taking it and 
its effects hitting you. Those time spans are extremely SHORT forspe ed, 
ketam ine and coc aine and long for md ma, ac id, etc so at first glance 
this hypothesis seems to make a lot of sense. Comments?

For the past few months, in Long Island and New York, all I've seen for
poor attempts at acid are undipped blotter..  If you're going to buy, buy
one, get the dealer's number, and if it's good, buy some more.. hard
finding quality stuff nowadays.

I agree, I don't think everyone uses drugs to get "fucked up."  When
you're talking hallucinogens, or even dissociatives, I think they help you
see rthings differently in the world..  I think they give you a bigtger
picture of things, and help you see things you wouldn't ordinarily
havepaid attention to..   but that's just my meager opinion..  :)

stupid drugs are stuff like coke, cigarettes, alcohol, etc..  that are
either escapit or can do a lot of damage, and are addictive..  Funny how
some of hte worst drgs are legal..

most drug use though is just to get fucked up..

I disagree.  Look at pot.   Pot hits you in a matter of minutes, and it's
not generally considered addictive.  Ketamine isn't generally considered
addictive, either..  it's a dissociative anesthetic.  

Coke, however, is addictive because the effects when you come down make
you need to take more to keep yourself at a good level.  After a certain
period of time, you need to take coke just to feel "normal."   

I think dependence is VERY much based on the individual, and can happen
with drugs that are not addictive as easily as with drugs that are.
Certain types of personalities are more prone to getting addicted to
things.  

I think there's no correlation between the amount of time it takes to hit
and the addictive potential..  I think that the things which take longer
to hit are most probably less addictive in their nature, and not simply
because they take more time to hit..  but I may be wrong..  

shrug..

Ketamine not addictive... whoa that's a new theory. It's a highly
addictive form of anphetamine it may be dissassociative but that means
that it disconnects or blurs the connection between your central nervous
system from your brain so that in SEVERE Trauma people can get their limbs
severered without going into shock and dying.

Whoah!  Amphetamine?  It's an anasthetic, it can put people under..  It's
still used in hospitals in some cases when they also give you a drug that
makes you not experience anything that could be called an NDE (near death
experience, or a trip) when you come out of it.. 

I mean, read the ketamine FAQ on
http://207.66.171.40/drugs/synthetics/ketamine/Ketamine_faq.html

Ketamine is not an amphetamine..  it's a dissociative anasthetic..  

>From http://207.66.171.40/drugs/synthetics/ketamine/Ketamine_info.html
"
The effects are stronger and more profound than acid but last only an hour
or so. The subject should remain still. Experiences of the mind leaving
the body and floating in space, or even death are common. Bad trips are
supposed to be absent but there are serious dangers following heavy use.
Dr John Lilly and his fellow researchers have used the drug continuously
for weeks. Several believe themselves to have contacted alien
intelligences and two committed suicide. Although non-toxic (unlike PCP)
it appears to have potential for psychological dependency. K has been used
in experimental psychotherapy..
"


I'm not trying ot make anyone do K.  I have never done it in hte doses to
make anything resembling a NDE happen.   But if you're going to say
something about a drug, don't spread misinformation.  Ketamine is not
highly addictive.  It has a potential for psychological dependency.

I don't suggest jumping down anyones throught because of something you
read on one web page.  Web pages are often biased and occasionally
outright fals.  I happened to run across your source and it also went on
to say.  

                    This is why many
                    people, including vets I know (ketamine is used in
                    humans very infrequently, as it can lead to rather
                    unpleasurable experiences) refer to ketamine as
                    tranquilizer. This is not a completely inaccurate
                    description. In fact, it's a hell of a lot closer to the
                    truth than calling it a general anesthetic. 

    According to the page you cited, K is a special kind of anesthetic,
yet many medical professionals refer to it as a tranquilizer because
it's not a general anesthetic.  Maybee you should read the whole page
before posting.
    I'm not trying to diss on Ben, I just don't want people to get
obnoxious when discussing topics.  Have you noticed allot of people
unsubscribing lately, it's partly due to all the nonesense bickering.  I
almost unsubed myself.

Do you know what the hell you're talking about?

First, that's the reason it was used as a battlefield aenesthetic.

Second, Ketamine is NOT an amphetamine. It's not physically addictive
whatsoever. If you honestly believe those things, you need to get your
head examined.

It's a general aenesthetic in its *USE*, a dissasociative aenesthetic in
its *ACTION*. The people who refer to Ketamine as a "tranquilizer" are,
well, being ignorant. Something like the people who refer to cocaine or
marijuana as "narcotic" .

    Whos being self righteous?  I just think getting nit picky about
semantics is really obnoxious, especially in this context.  Next you'll
be correcting my spelling misstakess.  
    Everyones a damn expert all of a sudden.  I never claimed to be an
expert I just called someone on their source.
    Unless your a chemist or doctor, who gives a fuck if it's a
anesthetic or a tranquilizer.  It dosn't change it's effect or how it's
used.  IT HAS BEEN/IS USED ON OCCASION AS A TRANQUILER FOR ANIMALS. 
People also use it to get fucked up.  Big deal!

Okay, I apologize, if I came off as that.  I didn't mean to.  I didn't want 
people thinking K was an amphetamine..  If I came off as being nasty and all, 
I'm sorry and stuff. :P

erm, yes ketamine is sometimes used on animals in surgery. they used to
use   it on children to. but it's not a tranquilizer as such. it doesn't
knock you out. it just makes you lose the will, and in large doses, the
ability, to     move. i admit i haven't tried it myself, but my friends
who have say that you still feel pain, you just don't care, because it's
dissociative. you cease to care about everything.the idea that anyhting
even exists outside of the room you're in becomes difficult to grasp.
and the idea that you might possibly want to Do anything outside of that
room, or even in that room for that matter, becomes nearly unthinkable.
it's supposedly very pleasant. i don't know if it has the same
apathy-inducing effect on animals, but i know that animal-rights
activists hate the stuff, on the basis that the horror of being aware of
the pain being inflicted upon them must be only magnified by their
inability to control their muscles in order to do anything about it.

p.s. to those of you considering trying it, another friend mentions to me,
"Do you really want to be sitting there thinking 'g, this is how
children and animals used to feel during surgery'?"                      
but points out that other dissociatives are available OTC, if you don't
mind having to vomit before you get the "positive" effects

Most drugs are pointless, but I have to say K is one of the most pointless. I
mean I have to laugh at myself because a few months back I kinda got into that
whole thing..I just have to ask why....? All I did was sit there, and not
enjoy myself what so ever. Sometimes I even ended up in a K hole and it
sucked. One time I couldn't focus, nor could I walk...and this is odd, but I
could see better w/ my eyes closed....and I puked. I guess my point is this
folks....I think we all have our reasons for attending raves.., but I think if
you are doing K and going to raves then you are going to raves for the wrong
reasons. Because to me a rave is about music and dancing, FUN  and vibes being
exchanged from person to person(being active)... If you like being slumped
over in a corner somewhere then stay at home for christ sakes, because a rave
has no place for K.  Just speaking from personal experience.... I didn't want
to respond to any of this..but maybe by doing so I can change someones mind
about trying it.

You are basically right, but bear in mind that even 
psychedelics/disassociatives can fuck you up. For a while, there was a 
bottle cooked in our apartment every night of the week. You could even 
scare a razor blade over an empty plate for fun and people would come 
running into the kitchen and go "ooooh... you got any k?"

It took about 6 weeks for people to realize this might not be a good way 
to live and licks virtually disappered from the house after that. I don't 
think this was physical addiction though, more like being in a k-hole 
became a form of entertainment much like going to the movies or going 
drinking with your friends.

No joke. It's eassier to kick a coke habit than it is to kick a cigarette 
habit. As far as 'escapist' goes, E would have to be on that list as 
well... and plenty of people certainly spend their week looking forward 
to the loved-up state it gives them on the weekend.

As you need to smoke cigarettes periodically just to feel 'normal'.

You might be... I'll try to gather some definite info on the subject.

It's still used as part of many pediatric and elderly surgery protocols.
The reason for this is that it's an aenesthetic which doesn't
significantly depress respiration, which is one of the biggest risks of
surgery for the young and very old.

hey everyone :)

first off, thanks to everyone who showed @ scj on tues. nite...review
forthcoming.

secondly, please do not send mail to/reply to this account anymore...i'm
switching jobs and i wanted everyone to know i can still be reached at
this (permanent) email address:

hossam@topsecret.net


thirdly, veronica or anyone else, can u tell me if the akron nye party
(resolution) will have *any* jungle djs? i didn't think so, but i wanted to
see if anyone knew for sure...

does anyone have the complete lineup for cincy nye? has anyone seen
the flyers/know anything about it?

all i know is felix the housecat, cajmere, and dajae are supposed to be
heading up the housey side of things, phantom45, 3d, and the cincy
junglists (troll, mogli, braidey?) are runnin the jungle room, and there's a
third room as well, tho i don't know if it's for techno, or chillout or what...

if akron doesn't have any jungle, i think me and my friends are gonna
head to cincy...if anyone can tell me who's throwing the party, what that
crew has thrown before, their track record, etc., thatd be really
cool...also, what kind of space are we talking (and capacity)...lastly
(whew! ;) how have the cincy cops been in terms of busts lately? 

it's like 4.5/5 hrs to cincy from pgh right? (2.5 to columbus, 1.5 to cincy
from columbus? + pee breaks) that's too far to drive for a sketchy party,
esp a nye party...

i'd be very appreciative if anyone can help me with any of these
questions  :)

and please remember, from now on use 

hossam@topsecret.net

and not this acct, thanks :)

peace,
hossam

Since I've been receiving more than few e-mails concerning CLOCKWORK in
Toronto this Saturday, Dec 20, I'll just e-mail the info to the list.

The party starts at 5 PM (sunset), and goes till 9 am (little after
sunrise) on Sunday in order to celebrate the Winter Solstice - the
longest night of the year. From 5 - 9 PM there will be open tables in 2
rooms, so everyone is welcome to come and spin. Just bring your records.
There are 3 rooms in the venue, with a possible fourth one opening later
in the night (around 12-1 am) if necessary based on attendance. The
after-party will be at the Comfort Zone starting at 9 am featuring Nigel
Richards. 

The venue is located at 888 Yonge Street in downtown Toronto, which is
the sight of the Concert Hall (the old Masonic Temple). If anyone went
to RITUAL last month to see Richie Hawtin, you know where it is. Drive
on QEW into Toronto, take the Yonge Street exit, and drive north through
downtown Toronto for approximately 10-15 minutes. The venue will be on
your left.    

The DJ's for the evening are:

JUAN ATKINS
ROBERT de la GAUTHIER (a special 2 hour morning surprise set. NOTE that
he's not on the flyer)
NEUROMANCER
NIGEL RICHARDS
DV8 (live)

along side with the best DJ's Toronto has to offer in techo and drum 'n'
bass:

Algorhythm
Adam Marshall
Lotus
Vortex
Dominik
Freaky Flow
Freedom
Everfresh
Slip 'n Slide
Unknown Soljah

Spectrada (live) - Psy trance (St. Catherines)

ADM
and more.

Tickets will be $25 CAN (or $20 US) at the door. The Advance tickets are
all sold out in Toronto, there may be some left in Pittsburgh (check
Hypervinyl).

If you need more info,

Subject: {pb-cle} [216/330/440] what is WRONG with this picture? 
Sender: pb-cle-raves-owner@hyperreal.org
Precedence: bulk

apparently, on jan 17, 1998 in the 216-440-330 areas, there are three crews
throwing three parties:

intimate - akron - family pack n nuvibe
kind - cleveland - old man prod
kinetic - cleveland - punchbrothers

what is wrong with northeastern ohio when there are three parties on the
same night???? i've mentioned this before on this list, but it seems like
in cleveland there are dryspells, and then all of a sudden *WHAM* we are
hit with a million things to do at once. this is yet another example.

in the current ROM, the e-flyer for intimate states that whoever sent it is
"almost positive that this is going to be thrown together with Old
Man's party called KIND." i'd like to commend whoever thought of that
decision.

personally, i think that all three of these crews have something really
great to offer in their individual parties. however, how spectacular would
it be if these people could get together and decide to combine all three of
these parties! now i know this is probably a really unrealistic suggestion,
however, i'd like to point out that there isn't a real huge market up here
in northeast ohio to be "competing" for if they are looking to make some
money. more likely than not, people are going to be very split up and
undecided about where they want to go on this night, most likely splitting
up the profits and the crowds anyways.

northeastern ohio is relatively small, and i would like to see better
planning on the part of our promoters. that means being respectful of other
promoters who have decided to throw a party on a certain date, or at least
having some form of dialogue going on between promoters in order to create
UNITY rather than devisiveness. perhaps promoters already do this, and i am
just in the dark, but from the looks of the weekend of jan 17 1998, its
hard to believe that *discussion* and *cooperation* occurs in this part of
town.

i'd be really happy if someone could disprove me,

What's up? I response to your message about the three parties in the 17th. I am
the promoter throwing KINETIC. After all the confirmations and dates were set,
I discovered that there was another party the same night in Canton, INTIMATE.	
I got to talk with the promoter of that party and he said that his was said and
done too. I then discovered KIND the third. I spoke with them and they wanted
too team up but the place that I already had couldn't support 3 rooms, or
floors for that matter. The building has two floors and we are running both.
But from what I hear, KIND and INTIMATE will be colabarating in Akron.  So
there are only 2 instead of 3. But you are right in saying that there are dry
spells than a mash of parties all the same night. I kept my eyes peeled to see
if there were any other parties the same night before the date was set, but no
such luck. But if all goes well, bith of us will luck out and get the turnout
that we need. Both of the other promoters were real considerate about th fact
that there were other parties and all of us hope that everything goes well. So
all of you people have to get out there on Saturday night and support YOUR
scene. Help us all out in getting the turnout. Both parties look excellent
though, tough decision on which one to go to. But choose, and choose wisely!
until next time...

i totally agree with kate.. like there will be nothing going on in cleveland
for like, a month or more and then suddenly 2 or 3 things the same nite. thats
so lame..  its either drive 2 or more hours to columbus or whatever or else go
to some lame club here.. i know there are a few new places opening so
hopefully that wont be such a problem for long.. but another thing that
bothers me is that when there finally are parties here in cleveland they keep
having them in that boat storage place by U4ia...  first of all this place is
small.. which would be ok if it wasnt just one tiny room.. with no bathrooms,
no lights, no heat... no place to sit or anything.. it just sucks. and in the
middle of december, no less, when its fucking cold as i dont know what, people
keep having parties there.  i know so many kids that wont even go to parties
there now when they find out thats where they are.. and that just sucks cuz
theres nothing else going on and a few weeks ago someone threw creation.. it
was freaking $20 to get in i believe, and it was freezing.. it was pitch
black, which yeah, if i had my drugs before i went to the party woulda been
fine since id be fucked up... but since i didnt my friend and i went around
for 3 hours trying to find 2 hits of acid or mescaline..  can you say
impossible? first of all we couldnt even see anyone, second of all you couldnt
tell if people were trying to give you bogus shit.. it was just lame.  plus
there was no where to sit.. no where to pee.. did i mention it was freezing?
i mean, all these things taken into consideration.. it was not a fun time. for
us at least..  but obviously people agreed with us since half the party was
gone by 2:30am.  i dont mean to complain or be a "party pooper", but i had to
say it and hopefully people will take this into consideration before they
decide to have a party there again. at least wait til its warm for cryin out
loud! thats about it.

I totally agree with the idea that there is nothing for a long time than 2-3
in one night, it sucks. But sometimes it's unavoidable when you already have
dj's booked, a place, and flyers out when you find out that there is another
party, you can't change it. On the 17th though, there is one party here in
Cleveland, KINETIC, and another in Akron. So they are somewhat of a distance. 
  Also about the space in the boat garage, it has been used a lot. But
Cleveland really does't have much to offer, so finding a place is tough. People
who want to throw a party don't really search around, they just use something
they know is there. But I, on the other hand, don't like to go to a party that
is in a place where 50 others have been, so that is why I searched and searched
for a space that hasn't been used in a long time, well over a year, and was
different than the usual, and had all the fixin's. I found a place in downtown
that is totally heated, 6 different bathrooms, 2 floors, 5 rooms. It's not a
house either. We will be workin' both floors, and will have an Art Gallery, and
a chillout area. That's all the info I can give though, you folks will just
have to experience it for yourself, I assure you, you won't be disappointed.
laters.  I'm out until Jan. 10th!!!
peace.

I agree.. 

Many LA ravers (I'm from LA, BTW) are accustomed to going to two parties a 
week.  There is usually a small private (under 200) intimate gathering on 
Friday, then all the corporate mega raves line up on Saturday.

Why is the scene so thin here?  I visit Columbus about twice a year, and
during my three to four week visits, there is typically not one public
Columbus rave.  As far as I know, there are no local raves even on New
Years.  According to the locals, there are plenty of party goers, so is it
just a lack of promoters, or are things pretty underground? 

BTW: I'm still looking for potential carpoolers going to Shake-It, leaving 
from Columbus.

hey, i have been thinking for quite some time now that it would probably be
really really beneficial if cleveland/pittsburgh/akron/columbus got a little
schedule together of when events are going to happen as they are being
planned..  for example, one person could keep a list of all the parties in the
works and whenever anyone would throw a party, they could contact said person
and see what days are open. i know they do this in detroit and i'm pretty sure
they use it in a few other places as well.  this would definitely minimize or
eliminate multiple parties in the same city as well as possibly unify some
production crews.  the only problem would be the brand new production company
that doesn't know ANYONE, but that rarely if ever happens, so we could just
highly advise anyone interested in throwing something to get involved with the
whole process... this would most likely give incentive for more promoters to
throw better parties (since they wouldn't have any competition) and would help
people not have to drive so far away on some weekends if they want to go to a
good party

oh well, just an idea =)

Hiya!

I am planning on being at Shake It. (Yeah, maybe I'll break the record
for coming from the farthest away -- 11 hours??) I'm going to visit my
family for the holidays so I thot I'd make a little detour to Dayton for
this phat little party.

Look for me and come say "Hi!". I'm a short, blond girl. you can
recognize me by my green Ninja Turtles backpack with the flashing red
light on top. 

I'll try to make it to the net meet, but if you see me in the meantime,
I would love to meet some of you! Also, look for copies of High-R
Frequencies magazine. I'll be bringing copies and, if there is a flyers
table, I'll put them there.

Peace,

if ketamine isnt addictive, why do people say "i need to get into a hole"
like they need crack?

to untangle the web of confusion about its nature, i think everyone is right:
-its a amphetamine becuase if you use it with other drugs you are not
sleepier; perhaps even more excited or drug induced. it doesnt speed up
your heart but it definately speeds up something.
-its a anasthetic (sp?) because it makes you feel a little numb.
-its a traquilizer only if you use it as one.
it definately, as Stickman said,
      "disconnects or blurs the connection between your central nervous
system from your brain"

Ketmaine causes many intelligent people to forget about their friends. try
it. dont buy it.


and dont be fooled about addiction.
itll sneak up on you if you dont keep your sheeit in check.

The only thing that makes something an amphetamine is being of a certain
chemical structure. Anyone who says otherwise is wrong.

These intelligent people whould be consicous of the nature of addiction
and watch themselves intently..

strange how many times i've heard the word 'ketamine' in the past week.
flipping through an old OMNI magazine:
"The psychopharmacologist shies away from discussing the possibility of
genuine transcendence--when he does not actually pooh-pooh it--and
dismisses the Near Death Experience as a mere hallucination caused by
oxygen loss in the brain, electrical hyperarousal, and/or dimming
sensory systems. The NDE, Siegel says, can be simulated quite easily
with a dose of ketamine, a superpotent cousin of angel dust."
interesting article...
"'Altered states remind us that we're much more than we think we are.
The orthodox view is that the mind is a biological computer, totally
self-contained and limited by physical laws. If you have an experience
of leaving your body, becoming one with the universe, or meeting a
spiritual being, Western science tells you it's an illusion--just as if
you had programmed your Apple computer to say, "I have just attained
oneness with the Ultimate Chip." The implicit assumption is that there
is a normal state of consciusness and that all others are degenerate
forms of it', Tart says. 'But what one person experiences in an altered
state may fall into another's ordinary consciousness. We don't all start
from the same baseline consciousness, either, and we differ widely in
our ability to transit from state to state.' In his everyday state of
consciousness, Tart points out, the inventor Nikola Tesla could design a
machine in his head, specifying the parts down to one ren-thousandth of
an inch.
Can science ever map inner space? One obstacle is the troubling
phenomenon called state-bound knowledge, which is basically the
psychological law that some information is not easily transferred from
state to state. If you lose your car keys while you're drunk, you might
have to drink a few pina coladas the next day to remember where you put
them; if you learn the salient provisions of the Treaty of Ghent while
smoking marijuana, you'll forget them in your European history midterm
unless you show up for the test similarly stoned.
Tart believes this phenomenon may explain why religion enthralls some
while turning others off. 'Most religious teachings', he notes, 'are
actually state-specific sciences. They make excellent sense in certain
altered states, but in other states they turn into empty creeds that
other people are forced to believe in.'
What we need is a Consumer's Guide to Other Mental Realms. 'I can
envision an expanded psychology of the future in which we give a person
a batch of tests and tell him, "Kundalini yoga would be good for your
type of personality, but never do zazen; your type goes psychotic half
the time." But our culture isn't ready for it.'
In a way, Western civilization has forgotten a tradition that the !Kung
tribesmen are careful to keep alive. 'There is tremendous human
suffering because we've banished altered states,' Tart laments. 'We live
so immersed in our ongoing psychological processes that we're in a kind
of waking trance. And it's "normal"; everyone's in it.'"

I would have to say that by keeping altered states as a somewhat
"underground" topic, drug use is increased.  My earliest learning of altered
states was in 3rd grade, where we were shown this sensory deprivation
experiment that caused temporary insanity.  Eight years later, I read
Feynman's (Richard, physicist most famous for his lecture series and his
participation in the Manhattan Project) views on the subject, tried it for
myself, and it was pretty cool.  Then I got to PSU and away from the "Just
Say No" posters.  Although being drunk was occasionally fun, I found that
everything else I tried just made me stupid and numb.  In contrast again, on
the way home for Christmas break, I was coming off a 32 hour no-sleep
marathon, listened to "The Diamond Sea" by Sonic Youth and had this epic 20
minute dream corresponding to the music.  Try it, no side effects,
guaranteed no regrets.

Yes! severe sleep deprivation + music is Good stuff. i had such an
experience with Tangerine Dream. only about 15 minutes, but it felt like
many hours. leading up to getting totally lost in the music, i kept
hearing voices in the music that faded away before i could really
understand what was being said, and i saw a lot of movement in the
corners of my eyes that vanished when i turned to it. sleep deprivation
is such a cheap drug :)

That's the only way to obtain it-- stealing it from vettinary clinics.
Remember the old saying, "as easy as stealing candy from a baby?"  How do
you think those poor baby ponies feel when the medicine they need for
their operation has been lifted by a bunch of suburban trash looking for a
quick fix of nose candy?  

sad.

Hey Hannibal.

Do you ever get tired of being such a dickhead?

Sure, agreed, there are plenty of people who do stupid things to get
drugs. Stealing from Vets clinics is one of them. Robbing people is
another one. Now, IMAGINE if it was available WITHOUT having to commit
crime for it!

When it comes down to it, Hannibal, you're so sickeningly self-righteous
about what "candy ravers" do, what "druggies" do, it's unbelievable how
fucking intolerant you are.

There's plenty of bad people all over the rave scene, and there plenty of
bad people all over the world. Talking trash about how bad they are
doesn't make you any better, and in fact, it's really pretty loathsome.

That's true and funny.  We are descendants of ponies; show some respect.

There would be less of a subterranean tone attached to using it.  It would
share the same status as abusing NyQuil.

Speaking of ketamine...
My neighbor declawed his cat in his very own home.  He used ketamine.  I was
there.  I had access.  The cat looked dead.  We made it stand up and dance.

what up all?

does anyone know if there is an archive of the pb-cle list before october
95 (that's as far as it goes back on the website)? i was recently telling
my friend about how i annoying i used to be when i first got on (to all
the old skoolers: sorry bout dat ;) and my enlightened postings ("what is
a rave?" - "do people use drugs at raves?" :) ... since i joined the list
when i barely even knew what a rave was (age 13 or so), i'd love to see
the posts now that i am infinitely more knowledgeable then i wuz back
then.

i saw this awhile ago. and i think it fits now.

it was a vote for a new rave slogen instead of "PLUR" 
and i think we should use it for this list.
since we alll just seem to get along so great

Does anyone still have the ROM info for Shake-It?  Whoever maintains the
list already erased it, and I'd like to have another look at the lineup. 
A couple DJ's there impressed me, and I need to see who they were. 

The sounds at Shake-It really kicked ass in terms of originality.  

The visuals were the best I've ever seen at a party.  Very well done. 

I don't see why they shut the sound off at 1:30.  I know we have to
respect the police, but I think that was overkill.  In LA, the music does
not stop, unless cops invade and chase everyone out.  It actually turned
out to be a good thing for me in this case because during the half hour of
silence, I met some really interesting people who I will be in contact
with outside of raves. 

The vibe was decent, but some things were left to be desired; 
like-

* a speaker pile
* candy ravers on the speakers
* more dancers, less spectators

Also, what was a porn star doing there, and why did they give him a mic? 

So there were some deficiencies, but the music and visuals made up for 
it.  Overall, IMO Shake-It was phat.

Hello promoters,

                I am dance music artist Gyrate, and I'm searching for
promoters
to book my live PA for the month of December and through the year of
1998.
INFO: 
        The style of music I produce is progressive with tranced
undertones,
melodic with acidic overtones, and extremely inspirational. The majority
of my music is designed not just to dance to, but to lift the spirit and
touch the soul. I've been creating dance music for about 4 years and
playing the piano for about 10. I have a single out on Global Energy
Muzik(LA) and am currently shopping for new labels. I've mainly played
for raves and night clubs in the southwestern region, and Orlando
Florida. I would love to travel my act nationally, and eventually
internationally. My preformance time is between an hour to an hour and a
half and the set consists of 6-7 songs which BPM range is between 132 to
140. (more info. available on request)   
        
        To all those out there who are interested, and anybody else who
might know someone possibly interested, please contact me.

Hossam,

> this looks like one hell of a party.
> 
It certainly does. 

I talked to Juan who played for us (pHryL.) in Toronto on Saturday, and
he said that it will really happen, but he was not sure whether Derrick
and Kevin will be playing/performing. Also, according to what he was
told, John Aquaviva is supposed to be there as well, and Richie Hawtin
may make a surprise PLASTIKMAN appearance!!

I'm planning on going, but probably the attendance is not expected to be
too large, due to the family orientation of CHRISTMAS day. Lots of
people may choose (opt) not to travel or party, and rather spend some
time at home with their families.

BTW, CLOCKWORK in Toronto was great. Stickman or someone else from the
Pittsburgh/Cleveland peeps who were there may offer more details about
it. I would rather not review my own party, since I will probably be
biased.
 
Cheers,
Viktor

I looked at the line-up for shake-it, and couldn't find the name I was
looking for.  Who was the last dj spinning on the bottom floor?  It was
the first time I ever heard hardcore incorporating jazz wind instruments. 
Someone told me his name was Fiend (sp?) or something like that, but my
ears were blown out from being close to the tweeters, so I couldn't
exactly hear.  There were no names like that on the line-up.  Does anyone
know who I'm talking about? 

The scene doesn't seem to be very well organized in these parts.  There
are local parties on the NE-ROM that are not on the pb-cle-ROM, and
vice-versa.  Then at Shake-It, I got flyered for parties that weren't on
either list, and they don't exactly seem to be underground.  As few
parties as there are here, it would make sense to put all public parties
in the ROM.

Tarzan in a Texas whorehouse.  This guy is LIKELY to drop in anything from
Megadeth to Vivaldi on top of his trademark dark/tech/hardstep ala hip-hop
hysteria.   Strap yer nugget on, pull up those phat pants and get ready for
takeoff ~~ it's gonna be a bumpy night!

===========

quick review of winter breaks:

cool space :) weird at first, but got progressively cooler as the nite went
on :) the movie 'godspell' (i think?) was playing and that had us
entranced for a good bit...

ed spun a good set of techno, which is refreshing for me to hear :)

dan666 i think it was played some darker drum n bass and his mixing
was pretty good, i think he's gotten a lot better since the last time i heard
him...

dj saint spun a surprisingly great set :) lots of rolling tunes, but never
dipping into that 'non-musical' area that defines too many of the current
'dark/techstep' releases, in my opinion...

chuck (saint) had everyone dancing (i'd say attendance was near the
100 person mark) and then giulia (mutamassik) came on...everyone
stopped dancing and just stared at her...it was pretty funny to observe,
but i'm sure shed have rather everyone kept dancing :) as john eperjesi
said to me: 'crowd dynamics are a funny thing' :)...she had a few dodgy
mixes at first, which in addition to everyones apparent amazement that
there was a lady behind the decks may have contributed to the leadfoot
syndrome that was in effect.

left halfway thru her set, i'll catch more of it tonite :)

shouts to everyone, but my poor brain is only coming up with: rebecca
from cali (santa barbara? san bernandino?), michael (mskw1-or did i
leave out some letters/numbers ;) nice to meet you) and of course the
punks i was hanging out with...

more later...happy holidays :)

peace,
hossam

just a note,

dancing IS permitted at NATO.

people HAVE been known to get on down @ the NATO. tho usually
in the wee-wee hours when we drop the old-skool funk + junk.
last week we left WAY too many tables out (which do tend
to discourage dancing.) unlike our NYC brethren, Pgh'ers are
not subject to "no dancing laws", based on venue permit status
(like for example lounges like NATION and Den of Theives in NYC.)
at least not yet, that is.

so u can dance if u want u. (we'll move the tables out the way.)

Ok - here's one out of the blue -

Anyone know what happened to MC SoySos - the dude who did the vocals for
187's track "This Sound" (joe, steph?)?  Last I heard he was doing work
with Soma Mestizo, but I never see them playing anywhere.  Did he give up
on MCing, or was it really just a short term thing to work on a couple
tunes...

Hope everyone got what they wanted. :)

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can
be found at http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ , set your

all.

>> Top 10 Suspicious Drug Using Cartoon Characters (NOT by Letterman)
>>
>>  10. Gargamel
>>  Most likely LSD.  spends his life in pursuit of little blue guys in
>>  faggy white outfits and mentally abusing his cat.  What does he plan
>> to  do with the blue dwarfs when he catches them anyway?
>>
>>  9. Olive Oil
>>  Probably Dexatrim abuse, maybe some amphetamines.  Who is that
>>  skinny?! She might even be anorexic. She is always giving her burger
>> to  her friend.
>>  One side question, what the hell are Popeye and Bluto thinking?
>>  They almost made the list for courting her.
>>
>>  8. Snagglepuss
>>  Can't explain it.  Maybe it's the name, or the look, but he is
>>  suspicious.
>>
>>  7. He-man
>>  This is an easy one.  I mean c'mon.  Roid monkey #1.  "BY THE POWER OF
>>  ANABOL!!!!!!"  Makes me want to root for Skeletor.  Alone in his
>>  castle,hitting the weights.  And on top of that he even injects the
>> shit in his pet tiger.  Animal Abuse.
>>
>>  6.&5.  Yogi and Boo Boo
>>   We all know what is really in those picnic baskets.  They go back to
>>   the cave and trip.  Another side ? - Are they gay?  I mean, take a
>>   look at Boo Boo.
>>
>>  4.  Droopy
>>  The number one downer abuser in toon land.  Can't someone slip him an
>> upper every year or two?  The only time I ever saw him happy is when he
>>  sees the picture of the babe.
>>
>>  3.  Dopey Dwarf
>>  He openly admits it.  The other dwarfs deny involvement but they are
>>  under investigations.  Allegations that Doc is writing some extra
>>  scripts for Sneezy and all the guys are partaking are afloat.
>>
>>  2.  Daffy Duck
>>  If he isn't using crack, Marion Barry is clean.  He is so wired he
>>  bounces around on his head without pain.  Blows his beak off all the
>>  time. Some  symptoms might be from "daffiness" but Haldol couldn't
>> work  for him. Might for his buddy with Tourettes, Porky though.

Shindig made me feel like i was at a RAVE!
Digital J - rocked you with hard acid
DCypol - the double punch of new skool hardcore and way-back uk hardcore!
DEADLY BUDA! - i never thot id ever heard that kind of noisecore in pgh!
               yee-haw!  brilliant as ever!
Adair - dark drum and bass manipulations without playing tunes iv heard a
        million tymes.

Awesome time and a good vibe.  
I wish we'd build on this stuff instead of just letting it be a once or 
twice per year.  Hopefully Tyrell's next party (The Bass Ball) will go off
too.

be fun...many of us have no obligations the next day (wed.)...there is a
very good chance well be able to go longer (~3am) b/c of the turnout at
the last scj with phantom (we had i think around 230...nice one :)

filmed tomorrow nite...we get a chance to show the entire world what's

funny u should mention this...

we were trying to get mr perl aka the sos to mc tomorrow nite at scj, but
unf. he will be otherwise occupied...

he is most probably pittsburgh's best mc...who ever woulda thought a
skinny little jewish boy like him would have a voice that sounds like he's
from deepest darkest jamaica?

he's fucking dope :)


to answer your question, he has been doing a lot of production work in
his studio in wilkinsburg (where some work on joe187's cd was done,
and all the vocals were recorded...

we'll bring him back out this coming year, i promise. :)

Why is it ppl think they can "control" whether or not they get addicted
to soemthing? The nature of addiction is, if you take it enough (and
your mileage may vary), you _will_ become addicted. 

Don't take addictive shit!

And if, as is quoted in another post, Ketamine is "a superpotent cousin
of angel dust," you REALLY don't want to take it. i used to dabble in
angel dust. That is the only drug of the many I have taken (in my day),
that ever caused any noticeable permanent side effects. 

I wasn't even a "serious" user and it screwed up the synapses or
chemicals in my brain that control memory retrieval. To this day, tho
other parts of my brain have compensated somewhat, I have to deal with
the effects of this at work, school, socializing, whatever.

Simple Productions....
theres a lil get together at the Palace Inn (Rt. 22 business + Rt. 48) on
new years eve.
it costs 10 bucks and goes from 9-3am. People are renting rooms and there
will probably be tons of afterparties, some intimate, some bigger.
dj's:
Dave Breakwell (NC, hoodwink)
Eric D. (house/breaks)
Giotti (trance)
plus two or three hip hop dj's confirmed.

there are two rooms and the guy whos throwing this has been doing sound
reinforcement at parties for a while although he took a long break in the
pittsburgh scene (didnt everyone?)
he intends to have four corners of sound in each room.

so, if you cant afford to go anywhere else this new years, this party
should be good vibe and lots of meeting new people kind of things...not one
of your everyone knows everyone and sick of them routine kind of things.
hey its new years. at least do something.

Frankie or anyone know anything about these djs?  I'v never heard of any
of them, which is weird in pgh's world of jungle/hardcore.  Perhaps
smaller out of towners.  Just wondering.
This should be an awesome event if it happens like the flyer says.

Hi!

I just wanted to report that I made it to Pittsburgh and back, and managed
to make it to X-mas Breaks in the process.  It was really great to catch a
very small glimpse of your world, and to meet some of you.  I really
appreciated the space, and the fresh air. And hello to Hossam, Melissa and
Todd.  I wish I could have more people who are on this mailing list, but
maybe next year, ... or maybe some of you will let me know if you are every
in my area!  I also was lucky enough to make the acquaintance of Chuck, DJ
Saint, who spun a great set, was kind enought to give me a mixtape, and came
to visit me a couple of days ago here in Santa Barbara!  He's a great guy,
and I'm hoping he decides to come to graduate school here in S. Cal soon.
We could use some more jungle in our lives, I think.

peace, Rebecca

>Frankie or anyone know anything about these djs? 

>> In the Drum and Bass dance hall we've got Hardcore, Happy Hardcore, 
>and
>> Jungle DJ's:
>> Da Mofo

he's the happy hardcore dj that spun @ dynamo and temptation. i haven't
heard all that many hh djs live, but he had me jumping up and down for
the better part of 90 minutes :) his name is pat and he'z reeealy
friendly (very happy to hear someone say that they dig his shit, because
pb-cle ravers tend to dis on hh)

>> Hazey

he also played at both of the above raves. at dynamo, his tune selection
was so so (hardstep/techstep), his mixing was aiight, and his scratching
was a sorry sight. at temptation, he had the second room rockin' (if you
can call it that with that WEAK ass sound system that they had in there)
with some wicked jump-up selection.

>> Kief
>> K-Sea
>> Tribunal

can't help ya out there.

what did everyone think of scj last night? 187 rocked the party no doubt,
but fabio (uh... i mean jeffee ;) was a major let down for me (everyone
else, i think, too). his selection was SO bland... i just expected more,
i guess.

dats it.
