Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

none of those people has done anything of any relevence in the
past 7 years or so. its amazing to me that people continue to like
them so long after they were any good. 

seeing juan atkins live as model 500 in downtown detroit would be
like seeing robert johnson playing in a blues bar in the
mississippi delta. HOW MUCH MORE FUCKING TECHNO CAN IT

the difference being that theo is a good deejay and producer. who
even knows WTF robotnik is going to play? im just not that worried
about it really since im sure he's not as good a deejay as juan
will be live. now if he was playing LIVE, thatd be a whole other
story.

you might be right there Tom, 

but, I know that Im not going to see Alexander
Robotnick any time soon,DJ or Live. Juan
Atkins..well.. that dude owes me 5 bux.

at any rate, enjoy your show, regardless of who
you(the collective you, not just tom) choose.


just know that if you dont go to see alexander
robotnick, YOU ARE WRONG.
;)

Im sure Mr Robotnick will play some italo and or
electro at some point. will most like likey have some
ultra rare discotto records, and of course he will
play his classic songs " Problemes D'Amour" and "Dance
Boy Dance".

 Uh-oh.  C'mon tom, 
>he's not a real DJ man.  What are you thinkin???  Stick to your
guns homes.  

honestly, the only reason i find it at all tolerable in his case
is BECAUSE he's not a real deejay. he's just trying to cash in on
his resurrected fame, and since i like his stuff im not against
him doing that. he's not from the culture of deejaying, thats not
his thing. but admiration for the music he made does influence my
feelings, for sure.

In-Class Meth Demonstration Angers Parents

May 2, 2005

By Keith Eldridge


ELMA - A local woman went 'through the roof' when a deputy took his
anti-drug message to high school.

She says he showed students how to make methamphetamines, and she has the
video to prove it.

Grays Harbor County sheriff's deputy shows class, "And the reaction will
start occurring down there and start bubbling up."

It is part chemistry class and part drug enforcement as a member of the
Grays Harbor drug task force talks to Elma High School students about
making Methamphetamine.

Deputy shows class: "Then you'll have a little bit down at the bottom, the
white stuff, and that's your meth."

One parent considers it a recipe for disaster.

"I was really upset when my daughter had come home and said 'mom we
learned how to make meth today in school,' " said parent Teresa
McCutcheon. "My jaw just kind of dropped and I said, 'what?' "

Teresa McCutcheon found it hard to believe what her daughter was telling
her. She wanted to see for herself, so she demanded and got a videotape of
that class.

The McCutcheons say it's one thing to learn about the dangers of meth and
how to spot a meth lab. It is another thing to show kids how it's made.

"I think it's a good thing to be educated about it, but it's bad if
they're teaching you how to do it," said high school freshman Christene
McCutcheon.

We showed the same video to Grays Harbor County Undersheriff Rick Scott.
He says it's the same demonstration the drug task force has been putting
on for several years, but they'll review it.

"We talk about how methamphetamine is manufactured. I think there's a big
difference between 'how' it is manufactured and 'how to' manufacture it,"
Scott said.

Christene is asked, "So you think you learned how to make methamphetamines
because of this demonstration?" Christene answered, "Yes. I just don't
know how to mix it all together."

Scott says, "We'll look at this, but we stand pretty firm in that this is
an educational tool. The schools have been very receptive to it in years
passed."

The Elma Schools superintendent says the district will also review the
material but stands by this effort to educate the students.

The sheriff's office says they don't give specifics about the recipe and
they emphasize how explosive the process is.

who worked hard to make this event a success! I
was very impressed by the amount of participation.
We have been trying to build a psy-scene here

event was a big step in the right direction. We=20
were also able to maintain our techno roots with

Another observation is at the time of the events mentioned in this 
thread the 'headliners' were cutting edge and not de facto.  So at 
one point in time it seems people were more willing to take a risk 
and go to an event not knowing what was going to be heard.  The 
typical event go-er now seems less will to take the chance.

Nostalgia aside, a rotten roller rink is not doesn't compare to the 
number and variety of venues where great electronic music can be 
heard on any given Friday and Saturday night.

because the music sucks now. people have elevated "chance taking"
above overall quality. those guys were banging the shit out of it
in 98 and it was all good stuff. i must have listened to hundreds
of hours of swedish techno live that summer. WTF happened to them?
who knows. but they suck now more than theyre just regular. shit,
if they were still playing all those old records id still like them.

now youre smoking it. were you at any of those? the 2 day one in
the rink was probably the best rave ive been to. derrick may
murdered it, as did all the harder cats. what about subphunk 27 in
the irish centre? another great almost all hard techno party. shit
like that is untouchable today.

Having simultaneously owned two devilfish with memory modification I can
attest that it is an interesting machine.  I can also tell you that I was
able to buy a lot of other gear when I sold them on ebay in 2001ish for
more than the cost of a 303 + the devilfish mod.  The 777 covers most of
the devilfish territory (at half the cost) but I no longer own the purple
face one either

I know I know, I cant give it up.  The memory banks are nice but I use mine 
with midi 
so the banks are out.  I was really just looking for THAT 303 sound and 
didn't want to fiddle with the clones.  Like twisting ten knobs to get a 777 to 
sound like a 303 (on the fly mind you) is a pain for me, so I figure just use the 
original.  I do love the FuturRetro line.
I have been eyeing them for years and wouldn't mind picking up a Revolution. 
Any experience with those>?  And damn their only 800 buck$.  
But the Access TI and a RME Fireface are 1st in line.
I will probably not send mine off for the DevilFish but for service, 
cleaning, new lights, 
etc.  Do you know anyone in the states that can do mods/service on these 
303's>?
Thanks

Jon

there were a bunch of heads at that party who were down with Ed Rush.
Wormhole had been out for months at that time.  I think I'd heard Locuste rmx about 1 million times in a 6 month span there.
 
Aphrodite catches a bunch of shit.  Yeah he's cheesy, but he was a solid producer at the right time and place.  "Pop-jungle" if you will.

Ed Rush pwned everything that night... that set was filled with some
of the best dnb ever written.  I thought the Surgeon and Christian
Smith both sucked and I was and still am into the Swedish shit.  I
don't remember the jump up, I either forgot or left early or
something, thank god.

there's nothing like a couple thousand people going nuts to some
dope techno though. nothing at all. i may be mostly into house and
disco type stuff these days, but minimal stark techno gets me in
the zone. im looking forward to catching rob hood live in detroit
for my hard techno fix :)

Subject: {pb-cle} as promised...the blind analog vs digital test

ok for this i sampled similar patches on an alpha juno 2(digitally 
controlled analog oscilators and filters) and my emu orbit sound 
module(purely digital altho many will say emu filters sound analog)...no 
chorus on any of the sounds...the filters cutoff is turned all the way up 
with the res turned down to 0...the filter envelopes are set very 
conservativly...so the sound and the filter come on and off at the same 
time...these are just be pure saws with some square sub oscilator going...i 
used the future retro 777 to send the sequence to the keyboards.

i was going to use the hs60...but the 60hz hum was a dead giveaway...i dont 
wanna hear anything about dco's not being analog...they are analog 
oscilators...but they are digitally controlled to keep them from drifting 
out of tune.

listen to these two files

www.deadnb.com/juno1.wav

www.deadnb.com/juno2.wav

after a few days ill tell you which file came from what machine

just so you know...all the sounds were recorded to 1/4" tape at 
7.5ips...then sampled to my emu e64 from the tape at 18bit/48khz....i 
normalised the samples in the sampler...then i transfered them to the 
workstation...i then dithered the samples down to 16bit/44.1khz..

i cant stop anyone from loading these files into a sound editor...but if u 
really think you have good ears...do it without looking at the waveform.

whoever gets these right will get a beer from me.

the next game will be the 303 test...see if u can tell a 303 from a 777, 
bass-station, sh-101, and of course the orbit module.

good luck

nick

The only thing I can tell you about these samples is which sounds
beter to my ears.  I am not going to pretend to know where each came
from but I like beer and I like free beer even more so + I have a 50%
chance.... so I am going to go with #1 as being the Juno.  Btw, #2
sounds beter to me.  We shall see who gets the beer.

now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php

INDOOR / OUTDOOR SHOW on Huge Outdoor Private Patio

Featuring

Stacy Kidd & Dj Seven: 2 Hour 2x4 House Set
Chicago, IL 

WWW.DJSEVENCHICAGO.COM


Stacy Kidd was born in Chicago in 1972 and started DJing in 1987 after 
being amazed by the music he was hearing on the radio. He started out 
recording Chicago house mixes off the radio, and would try to mix them 
together with 2 tape decks. He would even try to mix them together on 
one radio with 2 tape players on it. After doing that for a year, Stacy 
began to have a good ear for the music and started to buy records.. but 
didn.t even own a turntable yet. It wasn.t until 1989 when he finally 
got a single turntable and started to mix with one turntable and one 
tape deck. Having mixed for a while without a pitch control on tape 
decks, using the turntable came naturally.

In 1990 Stacy was invited to play at a house party where he first used 
two turntables. There he met Paul Johnson who was a guest at the party. 
Stacy was playing a lot of unknown tracks he received from other 
producers like Ron Hardy, DJ Rush, Armando and Farley JM Funk. Paul also 
had some unknown material so they stared comparing tracks. Stacy would 
play one, then Paul would play one. This went on for hours. Soon after, 
they began to hang out and work on music together regularly.

In 1994 Stacy completed his first record with Paul on Dance Mania 
Records called "Stacy Kidd & Pilly P Doing Thangs Vol 1." They went on 
to do two more volumes before Stacy completed his first solo project 
called "15213 Loomis" on Dance Mania Records in 1996. Following Paul 
Johnson.s advise on musical styles, Stacy put out three club records 
that same year on Huge Records (Chicago), Relief Records (Chicago) and 
Peacefrog Records in London. In 1997 he started traveling with Paul and 
performing at different events all over the world.

The following year, Stacy made a huge impact on the club scene when he 
released five records on Dusttraxx Records (Chicago), Aftermidnight 
Records (Holland), Riviera Records (France), Daddy Records - a sub label 
of Peacefrog (London) and a remix for Ministry of Sound Records in 
London. He continued to release records and travel meeting a lot of DJs 
& producers from all over the world. By the year 2000, Stacy reached a 
whole new level, he was working on more vocal projects and remixes for 
larger labels as well as joining many tours and studio sessions with a 
lot of the top house music producers in the game.

In 2002, Stacy started his own production company, "Underground 
Elements", which includes vocalists Joi Williams and Matthew Yates, 
producers/DJ.s Tim Funatik (Dallas), Melvin Meeks (Chicago), Scott Payne 
(Chicago), and Ice Mike Lataker (Chicago).  In 2003, Stacy Kidd.s "HOT", 
got him recognized as one of the most versatile up-and-coming producers 
in Chicago by DJ Magazine.   Stacy also joined the Louie Vega and Kenny 
Dope (MAW) family on their new label "Kenlou Records."  Stacy has DJed 
all over the world and the U.S. and has a lot more production coming out 
of .Underground Elements. in the near future.

Rob Riddum, Cleveland . DnB/Turntablist

Rob Riddum is one of the most well known and dedicated Drum and Bass DJs 
in the Ohio scene today. The legacy began in 1996 as Riddum took his 
funky set to the streets as member of the popular Elements Squad. 

He has since cemented his reputation as a talented artist through his 
innovative, seamless mixing, dope track selection, and uniquely Riddum 
scratching technique. After taking a hiatus from the scene to focus on 
his studies at Kent State University, Riddum returns with a renewed 
determination to take the world of Drum and Bass to the next dimension.

When he's not out dropping his dope beats to live audiences across the 
Ohio and Pennsylvania scenes, you can find him in the studio pioneering 
the sounds of Drum and Bass as he is laying down his unique and powerful 
vibe in production of his own tracks.

Riddum recently produced the sound track and programmed individual 
tracks for MTV's Jackass and the "Steve-o, Don't Try This at Home Tour". 
"80's", an upbeat drum and bass track with a funky synth line, is slated 
for release early 2003.

Riddum is a talented, seasoned veteran of the scene and throws down an 
incredible set. His unmatched attention to detail and focus on the 
technical aspects of the art of DJing guarantees a seemless, spectacular 
performance that will leave the audience in awe and begging for more.

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's 
Electronic Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am :: Hart Plaza

Champions of furthering the turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made 
their reputation by utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the 
manual alteration between individual kick and snare sounds to create 
original drum patterns in real time. This practice has been an 
inspiration and a force in Roc Raida's style. His impressive finishes 
in some of the premier DJ battles; (first place in the 1991 "As One"; 
second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an 
episode of "Saturday Night Live"; (the first DJ to ever) has made him an 
american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hops 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such 
exotic locations as Singapore, Turkey, Japan and Australia. Roc Raida is

BURUFUNK
LIVE DIGITAL MIX // GODSEND MUSIC
WWW.BURUFUNK.COM // WWW.GODSENDMUSIC.COM
DEEP PROGRESSIVE TECHNOLOGY

Amidst the thousands of artists and producers that work in the EDM 
industry today, Curtis and Leaha are of the few who strive to create 
truly original musical compositions. The live Progressive Breakbeat duo 
has been shredding the airwaves, dance floors, and club scene with their 
exceptional productions and intense performances. Their impeccable 
fusion of harmonious melodies and earth shaking beats creates a unique 
style and sound that cannot be matched.

Burufunk is best known for their chart topping remixes which include: BT 
"Somnambulist" (Nettwerk), Deepsky "Talk like a Stranger" (Yoshi Toshi), 
and Wrecked Angle "Back to Babyon" (Electrofly) which had remained in 
the Balance Record Pool top 20 for more than ten weeks. They were also 
recognized as one of the winners in the BPM Magazine Remix Contest for 
their rendition of BT's "The Great Escape". Their most recent remix 
collaboration had them working with BT to create: BT vs The Doors "Break 
on Through (To the Other Side).

Their signature tracks have been heavily supported by the likes of Paul 
Oakenfold, BT, Deepsky, Hybrid and DJ Icey to name a few. Likewise, 
their first release together "Outsider" was featured on Global 
Underground 024 'Reykjavik' mixed by Nick Warren. Look to Godsend Music 
for more Burufunk material launching this summer as well as an upcoming 
album in the works.

There is so much that can be said about these visionaries... but their 
music is something words cannot express.

JAIA (Digital Structures . France) LIVE!
The act JAIA is the project of  the French producer Yannis Kamarinos, 
formed in 1995 with Jean-Michel Blanchet and first oriented  Psy-Trance 
and Downtempo.  Since 2000 Yannis is working alone under JAIA name,  and 
today JAIA.s music is more orientated to Progressive House and 
Progressive Trance (and still Downtempo too).  JAIA has already released 
an album .Blue Energy. in 1998 (Cross/EastWest/Nova Tekk), which has 
been re-released in 2000 on the Japanese label Dakini.  JAIA released 
several 12" singles too, as well as numerous tracks on various label 
compilations, such as  Island, Iboga, Wagram, Milan, Flying Rhino, 
T.I.P. World, and many others.  The new album "Fiction" will be released 
in May 2005 on Digital Structures.  Yannis has collaborated with other 
producers-DJ.s such as DADO, WIZY NOISE, and SILICON SOUND.  He has 
remixed famous artists like the French singer MYLENE FARMER . including 
her last two singles "C.est Une Belle Journe" and "Pardonne-Moi" 
(Polydor/Unive

ANTIX (Iboga Records . New Zealand) LIVE!
Based in Auckland New Zealand, Barton and Hayden Strom are the producers 
behind the project ANTIX.  The Strom brother.s dedication to pushing 
their style in new directions in the ever evolving Progressive Trance 
genre has made them one of the emerging acts to watch for in their 
scene.  Both Barton and Hayden were introduced to music at a young age 
listening, to music from their parent.s vast record collections.  They 
quickly became addicted to the hypnotic sounds of Trance in '95 when a 
friend handed them a tape urging them to check it out.  Barton instantly 
purchased a mixer and started DJ'ing at small parties in the growing 
Auckland scene.  Six months later he had moved to Japan to buy studio 
equipment and teach himself the art of production, and Hayden later 
joined him.  Together they returned to New Zealand, setting up various 
studios around Auckland and refining a sound, which really came together 
once they moved to the West Coast of the North Island and set up Slow 
Burn
 ing
Studios in '99.  The sound that seemed to evolve was a kind of minimal 
organic groove influenced by the European sound being played by DJ 
PHILIPP from Plastik Park and ANTI from Spiral Trax.  It wasn't long 
before a connection was made when Philipp toured Australia and New 
Zealand in 2000, and ANTIX were signed for their first 12", "Rainstick," 
on Plastik Park.  Over the years the two have managed to put a few of 
the "big ones" under their belts, playing the U-Site Fusion Festival in 
Germany, The Boom in Portugal, and The Rainbow Serpent in Australia.  
And now three years down the line, ANTIX completed their long awaited 
debut album "Lull" released on the Danish label Iboga Records.  The duo 
are currently touring the globe for the third year, they are only half 
way to completing this tour, but so far its been a huge success, playing 
parties in Denmark, Sweden, Croatia, Japan, the Voov Festival 2003 in 
Germany and then in London, where they played alongside other respected 
kiw
 i
artists for the annual New Zealand music night at club Fabric.  And now 
to continue the tour ANTIX will play in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Austria and then to finish in France.  On top 
of this they.ve also been involved in Auckland label Manta.  The label 
has just released its second 12" and third compilation "Subduction" 
featuring a excellent selection of New Zealand and international, 
Progressive/Psy-Trance which are all available from Cyberculture Records 
at (www.cyberculture.co.nz).  So at last...  Here comes the second full 
length album from ANTIX - "Twin Cost Discovery."  Since their first 
album - "Lull" - released on Iboga Records in June 2003, ANTIX had major 
success with their very groovy and unique style.  They have been playing 
their live set at a great number of events and have made a very good 
name for themselves in the scene.  Now two years later, Iboga Records is 
proud to be releasing another well produced album.  From start to end
  the
Strom brothers take you on a journey deep into their soundscapes.  You 
can truly tell that ANTIX has spent many hours making this album come 
true, and once again they surprise with their style, going in a new 
direction.

DEVIANT SPECIES (Ambivalent Records . London) LIVE!
DEVIANT SPECIES are the England based electronic duo who are currently 
touring Japan consisting of Santos De Castro and Paul Wright.  
Consistently releasing their unique take on the London Techno sound for 
the past five years, they are now preparing to release their third 
album, "In the Hands of the Randomiser," later this year on Ambivalent 
Records.  From the Warlock Studios comes the long-awaited album by 
DEVIANT SPECIES.  No need for introductions, once more you will be 
treated to nine quality-consistent cuts of dark and minimal psychedelia 
for the blackest hours of the night.  In this third album installment by 
DEVIANT SPECIES the band is now only made up of Santos De Castro with 
collaborations with ex-DEVIANT SPECIES member Paul Konrad Wright (now of 
N.R.S. fame) and ground-breaking producer Ady Connor from SCORB.  The 
atmosphere prevailing here is hard, with tinges of Industrial and 
Ambient intros and outros that cross-over giving the album a continuous 
flow.  It all ki
 cks off
with "Voice of Thard," a chugging and spatial number that builds up to a 
ripping chorus.  "Pincushion Man" continues with galloping intensity 
where "...Thard" left off moving relentlessly to a climatic final before 
"Shellless" ebbs in soothingly with an overture of peerless Gothic 
beauty.  The tight pulse is quickly restored leading to a frantic groove 
that allows you to breathe with its interspersed waves of noise.  On a 
slightly softer tip "Thermal Boundaries" follows with an infectious beat 
that gradually gathers momentum to trancing-out effect.  In a similar 
rolling yet relaxed vein enters "The Retinal Circus," which has been 
doing the bootleg rounds in an earlier unfinished version titled "The 
Abyss."  To follow, "In the Hands of the Randomiser" is the first 
collaboration between DEVIANT SPECIES and SCORB, a powerful track that 
starts with an Industrial soundscape and steamrolls forward into a 
roaring pay-off.  For the darkest hour "A Night to Dismember" brings the 
proce
 edings
to total mayhem before the forces of light emerge.  "Portal to Balojax" 
is a 3-minute-plus unwinding ambient piece and serves as a prologue to 
"The Entrapment of John Dory," the only morning track in the album and 
the second DEVIANT SPECIES vs. SCORB outing, a delicate cut destined to 
be a classic.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} as promised...the blind analog vs digital test

2 def sounds better, 1 actually sounds like it has some sort of chorus
on it.  i dont claim to know the ear difference between analog and
digital, but my guess is that #1 is the analog just because it does
sound like it is more "full" (hence my chorus comment).  if i were
producing music though, i would use whatever created sample 2 because
it was more aurally pleasing.

i attempted to get the irish center for CDG IV last year, i didnt even
get a call back on 3 left messages over a month period of time.  i
guess that's what you get when on the first message you say you are
wanting the space to have 8-10 dj's play over a 12 hour period of
time...

Sure!  Weren't you at our last show at the hotel?  The gallery space 
is having a show this weekend.  The church is also available.  There 
are probably hundreds of party halls within 45 minutes of Cleveland...

We don't have a lot of money...Having cool space owners helps but I 
think it is just a matter of wanting to put on a show.

If at first you don't succeed try and try again...

One suggestion is to call them and ask to see the venue.  While there 
explain what you want to do.  Explain your game plan - do you have a 
plan for more events?  Give them an idea of your total budget.

Look at it from their eyes...Will you be a good customer?

the irish centre is just not interested. theyve had their shit
fucked up more than enough times by raves thrown there. im just
glad PBS got to do one there before they stopped having them. it
sucked having to drag that busted ass washing machine up the hill

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} as promised...the blind analog vs digital test

My somewhat uneducated guess is #1 is digital (the emu) and #2 is juno. 
  My only reasoning is that's a very juno-ish sound (again from the 1 or 
2 times I've heard a live set with it and seen the person messing with 
a juno) and #1 sounds like it was really tweaked to get it to sound 
like that and I'm not even sure what an emu is besides an animal :)

well, CDG cant just be thrown in any hotel ballroom.  it's its own
vibe.  you need a place where you can grill flesh over some charcoal
and mesquite.  you need a place that can be byob.  you need a place
with plenty of area to set up seating.  you need a couple private
areas.  you need a basement so that the dea crew can find a place to
write with a sharpie (lol, never gets old)... balconies also help.

so yeah, there arent "hundreds" of places that one can go to find a
venue short of calling up cousin vinnie to use his farm.

it was a good run... maybe sometime in the future it may be brought
back for a reunion.

Looks like the Trendroid mix was done under the name Brick City. 
Oscar G and Junior Sanchez also remixed it as part of the 2005 EP, 
available as a single CD. One reviewer on that site indicated 
there was a Mood II Swing remix with the original.

Ok.  I'll play.  Please note I am using my laptop speakers for my guess but 
I stilll think I can tell.  Juno2 is the real juno.  It's sound isn't as 
harsh as juno 1.  Also juno1 has either more osc going on or chorus.  As the 
emu is a sample based box vs va it would be impossible to remove this from 
the samples.  Of course I could be completly wrong ;p

werds to Jeremiah OSkrotskSKY's touching song EVERTHING
my favorite lyric is "I'm your bandage when you bleed":
 
Everything
I don't know why you can't see
perfect? why can't this life be
if ever joy was meant to be
it was meant for you and me

Crying softly by my bed
hope and pray that I'd be dead
dark depression filled the night
then erased by your light

I'm the air that you breath
guardian angel when you sleep
I'm your bandage when you bleed
I am everything you need

Happiness is ever here
only when I hold you near
run my fingers through your hair
you know I'll always be there

I'm the air that you breath
guardian angel when you sleep
I'm your bandage when you bleed
I am everything you need

I don't know if this is a fair test of an "analog vs digital" debate.   =
>From a producer standpoint, it is but one instrument in an arsenal of =
many -- each with different sounds.  I don't know either machine, so I =
wouldn't be able to tell the difference unless I heard it in context.   =
Juno1 sounded more digitized, but when it came to timeing and feel it =
was more organic as it if it had been "played".  Juno2 sounded more =
natural but it was more digital in the way the notes hit.    Both =
machines, however, were designed to sound digital.

So I would guess that Juno1 is the real juno, and Juno 2 was the =
computer.

One thing I would like to point out, however, is that when I argue =
digital vs analogue in music it is the "calculating" method in which it =
is performed.  I use this point of reference:   My mother is a pianist.  =
 I hate the way she plays because she plays without feeling.  Everything =
is calculated and it is played exactly as written.  I would like to hear =
her play with more feeling, adding her own interpretation on how the =
music is written.   My sister is the same way as a vocalist.  She sings =
exactly as it is written, with little creative interpretation.  There is =
a lot of space in between notes that is left up to human interpretation, =
and dynamics of how each note is played/sung that make up the entire =
piece.  In a digital presentation, sure, you can emulate dynamics but it =

whatnot.

I think 2 is the digital.  I like it better...tighter and less messy.


Could be wrong though.

"Although far from a household name, Tom Moulton is one of the
most important individuals in the development of contemporary
Dance music. "

hey, he's a household name where i come from ;) 

seriously though, i have so many tom moulton mixes that its
insane. ive got albums he did entire mixes of (cj & co "devil's
gun" is a really good one). ive got that BT express, thats a classic. 

he also did the mixes on this IIRC:

http://www.discogs.com/release/142355

which contains the good mix of harold melvin and the bluenotes
"dont leave me this way", my favorite disco jam ever.

i can do that here...i was gonna do 303 vs 777 vs bass-station vs sh-101 vs

its gonna have to wait awhile tho....ive easily spent the last 16 hours 
sampling an 808....midi sample dump is a bitch.

rebirth can be convincing for the more mellow 303 sounds....but you're not

with an era of unimaginably intense information overload.

good luck ;)  

im still on the prowl for the 12" just to keep at home in good
shape. the string builds in that track are continually amazing. i
just dropped it again the other night when i was playing a small
philly intl set (dropped some teddy pendergrass, some HM + the
blue notes "the love i lost", etc).

richie hawtin does some really nice tame 303 work on the consumed
album. obviously i like the more over the top stuff on the
dancefloor ;) 

its funny, ive picked up a good bit of classic chicago jacking
acid joints, some really rare and awesome stuff but when i play it
people arent feeling it. i cant figure out why. too "Techno"
sounding for people, maybe?

on one of shawn's recent records (i think its actually not out
yet, white label only at the moment) he used a computer program
that i cant remember the name of. its just a 303 emulation, but
with a little distortion it sounded pretty authentic. i was much
more impressed with that than with rebirth's 303.

Agreed with Tom on this one.  Rebirth was sorta the first 303 emulator.   
There have been MUCH better ones since.  Hell, the default 303ish thing in  
OrionPro sounds better than Rebirth.

thats weird...any time me and jesse play jacking acid ppl love it...same 
thing when sherry spins acid.

maybe its just the pittsburgh crowd.

what i like doing with a tame 303 is turning it down all the way at the 
channel...then cranking up the send....cool little trick i learned from 
rebrith...it makes a really spaced out 303.

its amazing how versitle that little box can be with a little creative 
routing.

i think refx makes that...it might even be called TB BASSLINE!  i had it a 
few years ago...never really got into it...but thats cuz i had a shitty vst 
host at the time...but it definately sounds better than rebirth for 303 
squelch.

are you playing the 90s type stuff? the cuts i drop are mid 80's
trax type stuff, a 707 and a 303 loop. stuff like this (which i
got for $5!!!):

http://www.discogs.com/release/39662

people just look at me funny. i cant figure it out. maybe its too
minimal and not evolving? the tracks arent very long though. 

drop an old daft punk track and the people go crazy though ;)

it could be called muon tau pro now that i think about it some more

the 808/909 in rebirth is pretty decent.

I think I make up enough noise for a few people (at least compared to me 
just standing next to a speaker somewhere most of the time).  Remember a 
couple times shouting "more acid!" durring sherry's set :)  sucks it 
wasn't recorded.

My guess is with rewire it can be used with different apps.  I have been 
playing with ableton and I can get rebirth to work through rewire fine. 
  The few ms delay is annoying and I haven't gotten around to tweaking, 
but just a something-to-do type thing, not too bent over it.  Not sure 
how much I'd rely on it durring a live setup, though.  If anything, I'd 
just make samples and play those in ableton.

I've thought about mentioning this for a while now but knew people would 
be annoyed or something, that's why I did it now so I don't have much

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} as promised...the blind analog vs digital test

<<on one of shawn's recent records>>

i think in some cases, the "who" has more to do with it than the
"what"...someone who's truly talented (as i think shawn is most of the time)
can rock a casio sk-1 or a vintage moog modular, and have great results
either way.

i dunno. it just seems to me that no matter what tools i have at my
disposal, most times, the end product still comes out sounding amateurish,
because i don't have the knowledge and experience that people like shawn
have. i mean, i'm still working at it, and it's something i do for the love
of it, but i still catch myself wondering how much of it is
inspiration/perspiration, and how much of it is just in-born aptitude....

I think, hell, I forget what I voted.


Who cares.  hardware is for idiots.  All we've learned is that they are

like someone who spent 300 bucks is an idiot.

and this doesnt bother me one bit.  pay 25 bucks for the weekend pass,
and most of you are paying 25 bucks for the first 4 years too that you
saw for free.  you can't beat the lineup for the price, any way you
look at it.

i'm sure most of you will also have no problem with spending 20 bucks
for an afterparty either... cause you know it's worth it.

the thing with real 303s though is that plenty of completely
talentless individuals have made classic acid records with them.
for every hardfloor you have like 5 "acid tracks".

i think it all depends on what youre trying to do. if your goal is
a super pretty professional sound, that kinda thing takes
experience and time. shit, shawn's records from the hypervinyl
days dont sound nearly as "finished" as his records do now. its a
process. 

of course you could just not give a shit and pump out some nasty
ass dirty dance music. this stuff is still more punk rock than pop
music.

and most of you are paying 25 bucks for the first 4 years too that you

i'm sure most of you will also have no problem with spending 20 bucks
for an afterparty either... cause you know it's worth it.

Tiesto offering truly tedious

By YURI WUENSCH, SPECIAL TO THE  EDMONTON SUN

Last year, I missed my window of opportunity to critically  lambaste 
Tiesto's In Concert DVD (out now on Blackhole Recordings), a  deplorable 
display of unchecked ego and poor filmmaking. However, thanks to  In Concert 
2, a virtual copycat of the first, my vitriol for the world's No.  1 DJ has 
an outlet.

The world of electronic dance is, inexplicably  and to the best of my 
knowledge, the only genre of music to boast annual  polls to determine which 
DJ is No. 1. For the last few years, Tiesto has  been tops, the reigning 
king of trance and, in turn, the dance world. It's  hard to dismiss trance's 
popularity - the 70,000 people that turned up for  Tiesto's shows in Arnhem, 
Holland, and Hasselt, Belgium, last fall testify  to it.

Tiesto also has the distinction of being the first and only DJ to  have ever 
played the opening ceremonies of the Olympics.

You know  this after watching In Concert 2 because, not unlike the first 
DVD, the  house announcer tells the audience so, along with facts about 
Tiesto's  mind-boggling record sales and other bits of egomania.

The In Concert 2  show sees Tiesto employing an elevated UFO-like stage, the 
same one used in  the first concert DVD. As a visual element, it's an 
admittedly inspiring  piece of hardware complemented by pyrotechnics and 
intricate light  displays.

But as high up as Tiesto is on that pedestal, he's that much  further 
removed from his audience. In his defence, it's probably something  of an 
occupational hazard. To accommodate such a large crowd, certain  performance 
concessions likely had to be made.

Still, it's hard not  to see what's lost as a result. Good DJs will read and 
respond to the crowd,  the interplay between the two being integral to 
dance's dynamics. But In  Concert 2 is just Tiesto as deified spectacle 
rather than audience  co-conspirator.

At larger rave-styled events, the crowd often becomes the  show, anyway. The 
best parties boast costumed characters and a colour parade  that is all but 
ignored on In Concert 2.

The camera never strays far  from Tiesto, only briefly interspersing shots 
of the crowd or the occasional  buxom European lass as an afterthought. No 
matter how many camera angles you  employ, a grinning Dutchman behind the 
decks will get old real  fast.

The direction of the concert is equally tedious, a hodgepodge of  jump cuts, 
bad edits and flash over substance. There's never a correlation  between 
what's happening musically and how the video plays out.

The  lack of continuity is compounded by the preponderance of stock shots - 
I  think I saw the same hands pointing skyward a dozen times. If the imagery  
had been synced to the beats, it might have been more tolerable. As it  
wasn't, I found myself simply listening to In Concert 2 because watching it  
gave me a headache.

I was more impressed with Tiesto's skills as a DJ  on this particular 
outing, but only marginally so. Produced in Dolby 5.1,  the music is crisp 
and clean and you can actually hear him working the mix,  or at least 
attempting to. I don't mind hearing a DJ struggle with a mix if  only 
because it at least shows they're trying. However, when you bring the  mix 
full-stop, as Tiesto does on a couple of occasions, it's either because  of 
a complete lack of technical ability, showboating or both.

Even  with the mix's inconsistencies, there are still some killer pumping 
trance  tracks. In particular, the three Tiesto tunes remixed by DJ Montana 
are  monsters, especially Breda 8pm.

When trance doesn't fall prey to a  patterned structure of big peaks and 
teetering breakdowns, instead keeping  things punchy and rolling, the appeal 
is undeniable. However, Tiesto  unerringly gives the beats breathers and 
those lulls stymie the mix's  flow.

There are also some live vocal performances mixed in as part of the  show, 
featuring Matt Hales from Aqualung and a large choir-like ensemble of  girls 
known as the Children of Orpheus. They're decent enough, though the  way 
they're presented had me thinking less trance and more Lord of the  Dance.

While I obviously have no love for either the first or second  concert DVDs, 
I do honestly hold hope for a third. Or maybe you just had to  be there. 
Still, I do think the potential is there for DVDs like this to be  done  
better.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

INDOOR / OUTDOOR SHOW on Huge Outdoor Private Patio

Featuring

Stacy Kidd & Dj Seven: 2 Hour 2x4 House Set
Chicago, IL 

WWW.DJSEVENCHICAGO.COM


Stacy Kidd was born in Chicago in 1972 and started DJing in 1987 after 
being amazed by the music he was hearing on the radio. He started out 
recording Chicago house mixes off the radio, and would try to mix them 
together with 2 tape decks. He would even try to mix them together on 
one radio with 2 tape players on it. After doing that for a year, Stacy 
began to have a good ear for the music and started to buy records.. but 
didn.t even own a turntable yet. It wasn.t until 1989 when he finally 
got a single turntable and started to mix with one turntable and one 
tape deck. Having mixed for a while without a pitch control on tape 
decks, using the turntable came naturally.

In 1990 Stacy was invited to play at a house party where he first used 
two turntables. There he met Paul Johnson who was a guest at the party. 
Stacy was playing a lot of unknown tracks he received from other 
producers like Ron Hardy, DJ Rush, Armando and Farley JM Funk. Paul also 
had some unknown material so they stared comparing tracks. Stacy would 
play one, then Paul would play one. This went on for hours. Soon after, 
they began to hang out and work on music together regularly.

In 1994 Stacy completed his first record with Paul on Dance Mania 
Records called "Stacy Kidd & Pilly P Doing Thangs Vol 1." They went on 
to do two more volumes before Stacy completed his first solo project 
called "15213 Loomis" on Dance Mania Records in 1996. Following Paul 
Johnson.s advise on musical styles, Stacy put out three club records 
that same year on Huge Records (Chicago), Relief Records (Chicago) and 
Peacefrog Records in London. In 1997 he started traveling with Paul and 
performing at different events all over the world.

The following year, Stacy made a huge impact on the club scene when he 
released five records on Dusttraxx Records (Chicago), Aftermidnight 
Records (Holland), Riviera Records (France), Daddy Records - a sub label 
of Peacefrog (London) and a remix for Ministry of Sound Records in 
London. He continued to release records and travel meeting a lot of DJs 
& producers from all over the world. By the year 2000, Stacy reached a 
whole new level, he was working on more vocal projects and remixes for 
larger labels as well as joining many tours and studio sessions with a 
lot of the top house music producers in the game.

In 2002, Stacy started his own production company, "Underground 
Elements", which includes vocalists Joi Williams and Matthew Yates, 
producers/DJ.s Tim Funatik (Dallas), Melvin Meeks (Chicago), Scott Payne 
(Chicago), and Ice Mike Lataker (Chicago).  In 2003, Stacy Kidd.s "HOT", 
got him recognized as one of the most versatile up-and-coming producers 
in Chicago by DJ Magazine.   Stacy also joined the Louie Vega and Kenny 
Dope (MAW) family on their new label "Kenlou Records."  Stacy has DJed 
all over the world and the U.S. and has a lot more production coming out 
of .Underground Elements. in the near future.

Rob Riddum, Cleveland . DnB/Turntablist

Rob Riddum is one of the most well known and dedicated Drum and Bass DJs 
in the Ohio scene today. The legacy began in 1996 as Riddum took his 
funky set to the streets as member of the popular Elements Squad. 

He has since cemented his reputation as a talented artist through his 
innovative, seamless mixing, dope track selection, and uniquely Riddum 
scratching technique. After taking a hiatus from the scene to focus on 
his studies at Kent State University, Riddum returns with a renewed 
determination to take the world of Drum and Bass to the next dimension.

When he's not out dropping his dope beats to live audiences across the 
Ohio and Pennsylvania scenes, you can find him in the studio pioneering 
the sounds of Drum and Bass as he is laying down his unique and powerful 
vibe in production of his own tracks.

Riddum recently produced the sound track and programmed individual 
tracks for MTV's Jackass and the "Steve-o, Don't Try This at Home Tour". 
"80's", an upbeat drum and bass track with a funky synth line, is slated 
for release early 2003.

Riddum is a talented, seasoned veteran of the scene and throws down an 
incredible set. His unmatched attention to detail and focus on the 
technical aspects of the art of DJing guarantees a seemless, spectacular 
performance that will leave the audience in awe and begging for more.

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's 
Electronic Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am :: Hart Plaza

second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an

american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hops 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such

BURUFUNK
LIVE DIGITAL MIX // GODSEND MUSIC
WWW.BURUFUNK.COM // WWW.GODSENDMUSIC.COM
DEEP PROGRESSIVE TECHNOLOGY

Amidst the thousands of artists and producers that work in the EDM 
industry today, Curtis and Leaha are of the few who strive to create 
truly original musical compositions. The live Progressive Breakbeat duo 
has been shredding the airwaves, dance floors, and club scene with their 
exceptional productions and intense performances. Their impeccable 
fusion of harmonious melodies and earth shaking beats creates a unique 
style and sound that cannot be matched.

Burufunk is best known for their chart topping remixes which include: BT 
"Somnambulist" (Nettwerk), Deepsky "Talk like a Stranger" (Yoshi Toshi), 
and Wrecked Angle "Back to Babyon" (Electrofly) which had remained in 
the Balance Record Pool top 20 for more than ten weeks. They were also 
recognized as one of the winners in the BPM Magazine Remix Contest for 
their rendition of BT's "The Great Escape". Their most recent remix 
collaboration had them working with BT to create: BT vs The Doors "Break 
on Through (To the Other Side).

Their signature tracks have been heavily supported by the likes of Paul 
Oakenfold, BT, Deepsky, Hybrid and DJ Icey to name a few. Likewise, 
their first release together "Outsider" was featured on Global 
Underground 024 'Reykjavik' mixed by Nick Warren. Look to Godsend Music 
for more Burufunk material launching this summer as well as an upcoming 
album in the works.

There is so much that can be said about these visionaries... but their 
music is something words cannot express.

JAIA (Digital Structures . France) LIVE!
The act JAIA is the project of  the French producer Yannis Kamarinos, 
formed in 1995 with Jean-Michel Blanchet and first oriented  Psy-Trance 
and Downtempo.  Since 2000 Yannis is working alone under JAIA name,  and 
today JAIA.s music is more orientated to Progressive House and 
Progressive Trance (and still Downtempo too).  JAIA has already released 
an album .Blue Energy. in 1998 (Cross/EastWest/Nova Tekk), which has 
been re-released in 2000 on the Japanese label Dakini.  JAIA released 
several 12" singles too, as well as numerous tracks on various label 
compilations, such as  Island, Iboga, Wagram, Milan, Flying Rhino, 
T.I.P. World, and many others.  The new album "Fiction" will be released 
in May 2005 on Digital Structures.  Yannis has collaborated with other 
producers-DJ.s such as DADO, WIZY NOISE, and SILICON SOUND.  He has 
remixed famous artists like the French singer MYLENE FARMER . including 
her last two singles "C.est Une Belle Journe" and "Pardonne-Moi" 
(Polydor/Unive
 rsal) -
with BLUE PLANET CORPORATION, the Moroccan singer TYOUSSI 
(Fairway/SonyMusic), and the French pop band JPEX (Wagram). JAIA also

ANTIX (Iboga Records . New Zealand) LIVE!
Based in Auckland New Zealand, Barton and Hayden Strom are the producers 
behind the project ANTIX.  The Strom brother.s dedication to pushing 
their style in new directions in the ever evolving Progressive Trance 
genre has made them one of the emerging acts to watch for in their 
scene.  Both Barton and Hayden were introduced to music at a young age 
listening, to music from their parent.s vast record collections.  They 
quickly became addicted to the hypnotic sounds of Trance in '95 when a 
friend handed them a tape urging them to check it out.  Barton instantly 
purchased a mixer and started DJ'ing at small parties in the growing 
Auckland scene.  Six months later he had moved to Japan to buy studio 
equipment and teach himself the art of production, and Hayden later 
joined him.  Together they returned to New Zealand, setting up various 
studios around Auckland and refining a sound, which really came together 
once they moved to the West Coast of the North Island and set up Slow 
Burn
 ing
Studios in '99.  The sound that seemed to evolve was a kind of minimal 
organic groove influenced by the European sound being played by DJ 
PHILIPP from Plastik Park and ANTI from Spiral Trax.  It wasn't long 
before a connection was made when Philipp toured Australia and New 
Zealand in 2000, and ANTIX were signed for their first 12", "Rainstick," 
on Plastik Park.  Over the years the two have managed to put a few of 
the "big ones" under their belts, playing the U-Site Fusion Festival in 
Germany, The Boom in Portugal, and The Rainbow Serpent in Australia.  
And now three years down the line, ANTIX completed their long awaited 
debut album "Lull" released on the Danish label Iboga Records.  The duo 
are currently touring the globe for the third year, they are only half 
way to completing this tour, but so far its been a huge success, playing 
parties in Denmark, Sweden, Croatia, Japan, the Voov Festival 2003 in 
Germany and then in London, where they played alongside other respected 
kiw
 i
artists for the annual New Zealand music night at club Fabric.  And now 
to continue the tour ANTIX will play in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Austria and then to finish in France.  On top 
of this they.ve also been involved in Auckland label Manta.  The label 
has just released its second 12" and third compilation "Subduction" 
featuring a excellent selection of New Zealand and international, 
Progressive/Psy-Trance which are all available from Cyberculture Records 
at (www.cyberculture.co.nz).  So at last...  Here comes the second full 
length album from ANTIX - "Twin Cost Discovery."  Since their first 
album - "Lull" - released on Iboga Records in June 2003, ANTIX had major 
success with their very groovy and unique style.  They have been playing 
their live set at a great number of events and have made a very good 
name for themselves in the scene.  Now two years later, Iboga Records is 
proud to be releasing another well produced album.  From start to end
  the
Strom brothers take you on a journey deep into their soundscapes.  You 
can truly tell that ANTIX has spent many hours making this album come 
true, and once again they surprise with their style, going in a new 
direction.

DEVIANT SPECIES (Ambivalent Records . London) LIVE!
DEVIANT SPECIES are the England based electronic duo who are currently 
touring Japan consisting of Santos De Castro and Paul Wright.  
Consistently releasing their unique take on the London Techno sound for 
the past five years, they are now preparing to release their third 
album, "In the Hands of the Randomiser," later this year on Ambivalent 
Records.  From the Warlock Studios comes the long-awaited album by 
DEVIANT SPECIES.  No need for introductions, once more you will be 
treated to nine quality-consistent cuts of dark and minimal psychedelia 
for the blackest hours of the night.  In this third album installment by 
DEVIANT SPECIES the band is now only made up of Santos De Castro with 
collaborations with ex-DEVIANT SPECIES member Paul Konrad Wright (now of 
N.R.S. fame) and ground-breaking producer Ady Connor from SCORB.  The 
atmosphere prevailing here is hard, with tinges of Industrial and 
Ambient intros and outros that cross-over giving the album a continuous 
flow.  It all ki
 cks off
with "Voice of Thard," a chugging and spatial number that builds up to a 
ripping chorus.  "Pincushion Man" continues with galloping intensity 
where "...Thard" left off moving relentlessly to a climatic final before 
"Shellless" ebbs in soothingly with an overture of peerless Gothic 
beauty.  The tight pulse is quickly restored leading to a frantic groove 
that allows you to breathe with its interspersed waves of noise.  On a 
slightly softer tip "Thermal Boundaries" follows with an infectious beat 
that gradually gathers momentum to trancing-out effect.  In a similar 
rolling yet relaxed vein enters "The Retinal Circus," which has been 
doing the bootleg rounds in an earlier unfinished version titled "The 
Abyss."  To follow, "In the Hands of the Randomiser" is the first 
collaboration between DEVIANT SPECIES and SCORB, a powerful track that 
starts with an Industrial soundscape and steamrolls forward into a 
roaring pay-off.  For the darkest hour "A Night to Dismember" brings the 
proce
 edings
to total mayhem before the forces of light emerge.  "Portal to Balojax" 
is a 3-minute-plus unwinding ambient piece and serves as a prologue to 
"The Entrapment of John Dory," the only morning track in the album and 
the second DEVIANT SPECIES vs. SCORB outing, a delicate cut destined to 
be a classic.

A new bill with extremely stiff mandatory drug sentencing is being
proposed in the House. I encourage you to call your local rep or just
send an email by going to

_________________
H.R. 1528, Defending America's Most Vulnerable: Safe Access to Drug
Treatment and Child Protection Act of 2005, is one of the worse drug
war bills that Congress has ever considered.

Among other things, HR 1528:

--Virtually eliminates the ability of federal judges to give sentences
below the minimum sentence recommended by federal sentencing
guidelines, essentially creating a mandatory minimum sentence for
every federal offense (including both drug and non-drug offenses).

--Expands the federal "three strikes and you're out" law to include
new offenses, including mandating life imprisonment (with no
possibility of parole) for anyone convicted a third time under the
RAVE Act.

--Mandates a 10-year minimum sentence for anyone 21 or older that
gives marijuana or others drugs to someone under 18 (i.e. a 21 year
old college students gives a joint to his 17-year old brother). A
second offense would be life in prison.

--Expands what is considered to be a "drug-free" school zone to
include almost any place in an urban area, and increases penalties for
selling or distributing drugs in that area. (The result will be
enhanced penalties for people in inner cities, while people in rural
and suburban areas get less time for the same offense).

--Mandates a 5-year minimum sentence for any person that commits a
drug trafficking offense near the presence of a person under 18 or in
a place where such person resides for any period of time. The sentence
is 10 years if they are parent. (I.e. a mother that sells her neighbor
a joint will get a 10-year minimum sentence, even if her kids were at
school at the time).

--Creates a new offense for persons who witness or learn about certain
drug offenses that fail to report the drug offender to the police
within 24 hours or fail to provide full assistance to the police in
tracking and prosecuting the offender. Offenses that would get someone
a 2-year minimum sentence, including failing to report a neighbor that
is storing or selling drugs when that neighbor has kids, failing to
report anyone that gives a joint to someone under the age of 21, and
failing to report a college student that is selling marijuana on a
college campus.

--Mandates a 5-year minimum sentence for any person that offers,
solicits, encourages, or induces a person enrolled in drug treatment,
or previously enrolled in drug treatment, to purchase, possess or
receive drugs.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} New draconian drug war bill in congress

Having enough drugs on you to catch a federal drug case is a bad idea.
If you play with fire, you are going to get burned.

Subject: {pb-cle} Peep's DJ Gear up for sale...

Wazzzup peeps!  I have a close peep here in Charleston, West Virginia who's
looking to sale his DJ Gear so that he can seek his dream...  The gear consists
of 2 x Numark TTX1s, a Pioneer 600 Mixer, and I don't know what else.  He's
selling the mixer for a steal (so I think).  I'd buy it off him, but I'm
currently looking to purchase other equipment, and there's other personal
reasons for not buying it off him.

Details and contact information are available on my guestbook at
www.coachroebuck.com.  I've decided to leave his post on my guestbook so that
it'd be easy to get a hold of him (so I think). Holla!!


Coach Roebuck

May's installment of TechMix brings two of Cleveland's fantastic techno dj's out for a celebration of Jamie Tyler's birthday (and the birthday boy will play as well). 
Boompsie - Experimedia/Goahead - Acid Techno 
Funk Detective - Minimal techno and whatever else he feels like playing 
Jamie Tyler - Plate Tectonics - opening with minimal stuff, closing with ??? (And hopefully he'll have his mix done by then) 
Expect minimal tech-house and techno, acid and electro-infused techno, and anything in between the two played by two very talented DJs and one very drunken one (guess who's who ). 
Hope you like to dance...also expect lots of drunken silliness. Be sure to wish the "old man" a good one. ;P 
9pm - 2:30am - FREE - 21+ please 
Abbasso 1222 Prospect (under bottoms up) 216-566-7278 




I'm an official card carrying member of the I HATE WINTER club.
**Plate Tectonics**

I'd have had it done already if my fucking computer
didn't crash yesterday.  I just about gravity tested
the damn thing.

Oh well, there were a few mistakes in that mix
too...they small enough to overlook though.

Regardless if you're in Cleveland on Fri night and
need a techno fix stop by...you won't leave
dissapointed.

>and yes, it is true, KDJ live is not happening.

ive heard he's doing the live thing at an afterparty, but i havent
found concrete info on that yet. the only good thing about him not
playing the festival is that now i get to see aril brikha live
again, since they were supposed to play at the same time.

this is one one the reasons i decided to go this year.  saturday i am 
all over the
musiclogical stage.  a little unsure what to do around mike shannon/john 
tejada
time though.  i'm a bit disappointed about the lineup for the 
underground stage.
i love it down there.

got a room at the ponch just a few days ago - kind of suprised about that.

you didn't hear about the moodymann after party ?  no white people, tie 
optional.

>got a room at the ponch just a few days ago - kind of suprised about that.

me too ... I've had reservations at the ramada for a few months now but 
decided to check the Pontchartrain today and I was able to get two rooms 
reserved there this afternoon - each with two double beds - for a price less 
than i'm paying for the ramada which is a a few blocks further away from the 
festival.

knowing the pontchartrian though ... somehow it will get screwed up.

A Moodymann party with no white folks? They have white
folks in detroit?

sarcasm noted.

actually, I recall seeing a few in detroit...

 I saw some white folks being descriminated against at
a gas station while I was there. Thats wack! How could
people possibly treat someone like that as a result of
the lack of color in thier skin?
(i've always wanted to say that..)

hmmm.....

at any rate, I hope to be at this party!

sorry Tom, you will have to go to the Richie Hawtin
after party instead.

it's rumored that the bottom of tom's feet are black.  they might let 
him in if he
comes without shoes.  shower sandals might be an option.

i always miss out on the late night fun at the ponch.  i'm still mildly 
upset over missing
trevor's underwear show a few years ago.  i went to sleep at midnight or 
something.
i guess there is something to be said for the ease of escaping from the 
first floor vs 10
stories up.  i'll hope for the best..

>i always miss out on the late night fun at the ponch.

ive only been in there a couple times. the one time, the elevators
were taking FOREVER so i used the stairs. the fire alarms were
going off and smoke was filling the halls on more than one floor.
it was pandamonium. and it wasnt even that late, i guess it might
have been because of the weather. 

>i guess there is something to be said for the ease of escaping

at the shorecrest the worst youd have to do is run through a blaze
in your own room, out the window and off a second floor balcony.
all of which is pretty simple compared to the clusterfuck that
would happen if something seriously bad happened at the
ponchatrain. honestly, i was fearful for my life when i was in
there. i would never ever be able to sleep in that hotel. and i
can sleep through some shit.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

P.U.M.P. (Pittsburgh Underground Music Production) is Pittsburghs first annual underground music celebration on 07.16.05. Department of Energy, Nightbreed Productions, Kaola-tea, Nightvision, Full House, Electrasoul, and Death x Stereo are just some of the crews working to make this event one to remember.

First, Nightbreed Productions and Department of NRG bring their specialty to the table and made it possible for this event to be held in a virgin venue. This multi room WAREHOUSE with over 15,000 square feet will provide you with adequate dancing space, multi room environments, and most of all provide that underground feeling associated with underground music.

Second, Koala-tea brings on their skills and makes it possible for some of our big bookings for this show. Plus, Koala-tea is bringing out some of their drum n bass talent, along with Pittsburghs own Death x Stereo crew, the drum n bass for this event will be off the hook.

Third, Electrasoul along with Electralight will be providing sound and lighting for this event. With FOUR stages already confirmed and state of the art lighting and visuals, this event holds lots of suprises for everyone.

Last, local crews such as Nightvision and Full House represent most of our local lineup for this event. Progressive House, break beats, techno, all over the place, these crews will be sure to keep the crowd movin...all night long.

Event runs from 9pm till 6am. Admission will be $20 all night plus on site, secure parking available. Vendors please contact Department of Energy at 412-708-0473 before May 31st. Any further questions please contact djkelvinhertz@yahoo.com

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR: Talkin' About My Generation

Hi everyone out there of my generation!  Hey, where are you?  Hello?  Oh,
that's right.  All your brains have been sucked out and your bodies
flushed away before you even born...silly me.  That's where you all went.
You were murdered before I even saw you in 1st grade.  I didn't get to
talk to you in junior high school about growing up, because you were all
dead.  I didn't get to ask you to the prom, cause you were murdered before
you could even look around at your world.  I couldn't ask you to go to a
rave, or a concert, or a house party, cause you weren't there.  I can't
ask you for a job, or offer you a job, because you were ripped out of your
mother's womb and thrown in the trash before you could even cry.  And
you're still going to be dead as I get into middle age, and then old age.
You won't be there to talk to on the porch of the retirement home in
Florida, or to play shuffleboard with, or to talk about memories together.

I was born in 1977, four years after the Supreme Court legalized ageist
murder.  The Court decided that it is a woman's right to kill another
human being based on age.  Any human under the age of zero can be murdered
legally, for any reason whatsoever.  There have been an estimated
46,023,191 ( http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/abortionstats.html )
humans murdered since Roe vs Wade in 1973.  In just the year I was born,
there were between 1,079,430 and 1,316,700
( http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/abortionstats.html ) people who would
be my age now thrown in the trash.  The number of live births in 1977 was
3,326,632 ( http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005067.html ).  That's a full
FOURTH of people my exact age that had a needle jabbed into their skull
and their bodies vacuumed out and thrown into a garbage can before they
could ever be my friends, my lovers, my prom dates, or anything else.

The 1970s portion of Generation X is missing around TEN MILLION people.
The 1980s portion of Generation Y is missing around FIFTEEN MILLION
people.  Somewhere between a fourth and a third of my generation were
murdered legally.

So that's where you all went.  Why did this happen?  The people who wanted
ageist murder legalized weren't stupid.  They knew what they were doing.
They knew that they rebelled against the conservative 40s and 50s values
of their parents, and they knew that we would rebel against their 60s and
70s liberalism.  Since population growth is inevitable, what better way to
keep our generation "in check" then to legalize murder of us?  They didn't
want us throwing them out of power when we got older, so they killed off a
quarter of us.  And they were right, we do reject their liberalism.  A
Harvard University's Institute of Politics survey recently found that
college students supported Iraq war by more than 2-to-1, a far cry from
their parents' "ideals", with the 50-64 age group being the LEAST likely
to support the Iraq War
( http://www.seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Features/3-03-28GallupWar.htm ).  The
liberals took it upon themselves to literally kill off their competition,
in the form of sucking their childrens' brains of of their heads.  The
same people who are against the liberation of Iraq because 1,600 Americans
have been killed (who all made a choice to join the military) have
supported and kept legal the murder of FORTY-SIX MILLION Americans.

There is a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  There are multiple Holocaust
memorials.  There are multiple 9/11 memorials.  Where's the Tomb of the
Killed Baby?  Where's the memorial for the QUARTER OF MY GENERATION that
have been killed at the hands of abortionists?

I pray, and cry, everyday for the members of my generation that have been
killed off simply because of their age.  I wish they were here with me
now.  I wish they were allowed to keep their God-given right to life.  I
wish my parents generation didn't kill them, and I wish the generations
right now would stop killing the next generation.  No one deserves to be
missing a quarter of their generation.  I don't know what I'd say to
them...maybe "Hi, let's go grab a beer.  Glad to see you here."

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's 
Electronic Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am :: Hart Plaza

X-Ecutioners, Ill Tongue, Premiere Artists

In the late eighties Raida gained prominence as a member of the New 
York-based crew the X-Men who later became known as the X-ecutioners. 
Champions of furthering the turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made 
their reputation by utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the 
manual alteration between individual kick and snare sounds to create 
original drum patterns in real time. This practice has been an 
inspiration and a force in Roc Raida's style. His impressive finishes 
in some of the premier DJ battles; (first place in the 1991 "As One"; 
second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an 
episode of "Saturday Night Live"; (the first DJ to ever) has made him an 
american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hops 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such 
exotic locations as Singapore, Turkey, Japan and Australia. Roc Raida is 
considered among the best of the contemporary DJ's and has brought the 
underground art of Turntablism to a fresh new level.

BURUFUNK
LIVE DIGITAL MIX // GODSEND MUSIC
WWW.BURUFUNK.COM // WWW.GODSENDMUSIC.COM
DEEP PROGRESSIVE TECHNOLOGY

Amidst the thousands of artists and producers that work in the EDM 
industry today, Curtis and Leaha are of the few who strive to create 
truly original musical compositions. The live Progressive Breakbeat duo 
has been shredding the airwaves, dance floors, and club scene with their 
exceptional productions and intense performances. Their impeccable 
fusion of harmonious melodies and earth shaking beats creates a unique 
style and sound that cannot be matched.

Burufunk is best known for their chart topping remixes which include: BT 
"Somnambulist" (Nettwerk), Deepsky "Talk like a Stranger" (Yoshi Toshi), 
and Wrecked Angle "Back to Babylon" (Electrofly) which had remained in 
the Balance Record Pool top 20 for more than ten weeks. They were also 
recognized as one of the winners in the BPM Magazine Remix Contest for 
their rendition of BT's "The Great Escape". Their most recent remix 
collaboration had them working with BT to create: BT vs The Doors "Break 
on Through (To the Other Side)..

Their signature tracks have been heavily supported by the likes of Paul 
Oakenfold, BT, Deepsky, Hybrid and DJ Icey to name a few. Likewise, 
their first release together "Outsider" was featured on Global 
Underground 024 'Reykjavik' mixed by Nick Warren. Look to Godsend Music 
for more Burufunk material launching this summer as well as an upcoming 
album in the works.

So much can be said about these visionaries... but their music is 
something words cannot express.

today JAIA.s music is more orientated to Progressive House and

in May 2005 on Digital Structures.  Yannis has collaborated with other 
producers-DJ.s such as DADO, WIZY NOISE, and SILICON SOUND.  He has

ANTIX (Iboga Records . New Zealand) LIVE!
Based in Auckland New Zealand, Barton and Hayden Strom are the producers 
behind the project ANTIX.  The Strom brother.s dedication to pushing 
their style in new directions in the ever evolving Progressive Trance 
genre has made them one of the emerging acts to watch for in their 
scene.  Both Barton and Hayden were introduced to music at a young age 
listening, to music from their parent.s vast record collections.  They 
quickly became addicted to the hypnotic sounds of Trance in '95 when a 
friend handed them a tape urging them to check it out.  Barton instantly 
purchased a mixer and started DJ'ing at small parties in the growing 
Auckland scene.  Six months later he had moved to Japan to buy studio 
equipment and teach himself the art of production, and Hayden later 
joined him.  Together they returned to New Zealand, setting up various 
studios around Auckland and refining a sound, which really came together 
once they moved to the West Coast of the North Island and set up Slow 
Burn
 ing
Studios in '99.  The sound that seemed to evolve was a kind of minimal 
organic groove influenced by the European sound being played by DJ 
PHILIPP from Plastik Park and ANTI from Spiral Trax.  It wasn't long 
before a connection was made when Philipp toured Australia and New 
Zealand in 2000, and ANTIX were signed for their first 12", "Rainstick," 
on Plastik Park.  Over the years the two have managed to put a few of 
the "big ones" under their belts, playing the U-Site Fusion Festival in 
Germany, The Boom in Portugal, and The Rainbow Serpent in Australia.  
And now three years down the line, ANTIX completed their long awaited 
debut album "Lull" released on the Danish label Iboga Records.  The duo 
are currently touring the globe for the third year, they are only half 
way to completing this tour, but so far its been a huge success, playing 
parties in Denmark, Sweden, Croatia, Japan, the Voov Festival 2003 in 
Germany and then in London, where they played alongside other respected 
kiw
 i
artists for the annual New Zealand music night at club Fabric.  And now 
to continue the tour ANTIX will play in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Austria and then to finish in France.  On top 
of this they.ve also been involved in Auckland label Manta.  The label 
has just released its second 12" and third compilation "Subduction" 
featuring a excellent selection of New Zealand and international, 
Progressive/Psy-Trance which are all available from Cyberculture Records 
at (www.cyberculture.co.nz).  So at last...  Here comes the second full 
length album from ANTIX - "Twin Cost Discovery."  Since their first 
album - "Lull" - released on Iboga Records in June 2003, ANTIX had major 
success with their very groovy and unique style.  They have been playing 
their live set at a great number of events and have made a very good 
name for themselves in the scene.  Now two years later, Iboga Records is 
proud to be releasing another well produced album.  From start to end
  the
Strom brothers take you on a journey deep into their soundscapes.  You 
can truly tell that ANTIX has spent many hours making this album come 
true, and once again they surprise with their style, going in a new 
direction.

DEVIANT SPECIES (Ambivalent Records . London) LIVE!
DEVIANT SPECIES are the England based electronic duo who are currently 
touring Japan consisting of Santos De Castro and Paul Wright.  
Consistently releasing their unique take on the London Techno sound for 
the past five years, they are now preparing to release their third 
album, "In the Hands of the Randomiser," later this year on Ambivalent 
Records.  From the Warlock Studios comes the long-awaited album by 
DEVIANT SPECIES.  No need for introductions, once more you will be 
treated to nine quality-consistent cuts of dark and minimal psychedelia 
for the blackest hours of the night.  In this third album installment by 
DEVIANT SPECIES the band is now only made up of Santos De Castro with 
collaborations with ex-DEVIANT SPECIES member Paul Konrad Wright (now of 
N.R.S. fame) and ground-breaking producer Ady Connor from SCORB.  The 
atmosphere prevailing here is hard, with tinges of Industrial and 
Ambient intros and outros that cross-over giving the album a continuous 
flow.  It all ki
 cks off
with "Voice of Thard," a chugging and spatial number that builds up to a 
ripping chorus.  "Pincushion Man" continues with galloping intensity 
where "...Thard" left off moving relentlessly to a climatic final before 
"Shellless" ebbs in soothingly with an overture of peerless Gothic 
beauty.  The tight pulse is quickly restored leading to a frantic groove 
that allows you to breathe with its interspersed waves of noise.  On a 
slightly softer tip "Thermal Boundaries" follows with an infectious beat 
that gradually gathers momentum to trancing-out effect.  In a similar 
rolling yet relaxed vein enters "The Retinal Circus," which has been 
doing the bootleg rounds in an earlier unfinished version titled "The 
Abyss."  To follow, "In the Hands of the Randomiser" is the first 
collaboration between DEVIANT SPECIES and SCORB, a powerful track that 
starts with an Industrial soundscape and steamrolls forward into a 
roaring pay-off.  For the darkest hour "A Night to Dismember" brings the 
proce
 edings
to total mayhem before the forces of light emerge.  "Portal to Balojax" 
is a 3-minute-plus unwinding ambient piece and serves as a prologue to 
"The Entrapment of John Dory," the only morning track in the album and 
the second DEVIANT SPECIES vs. SCORB outing, a delicate cut destined to 
be a classic.

Sat Jul 16                        P.U.M.P.                       Pittsburgh

[whaaaa? a pgh party?]

P.U.M.P. (Pittsburgh Underground Music Production) is Pittsburgh's first
annual underground music celebration on 07.16.05. Department of Energy,
Nightbreed Productions, Koala-tea, Nightvision, Full House, Electrasoul,
and Death x Stereo are just some of the crews working to make this event
one to remember.

First, Nightbreed Productions and Department of NRG bring their
specialty to the table and made it possible for this event to be held in
a virgin venue.  This multi room WAREHOUSE with over 15,000 square feet
will provide you with adequate dancing space, multi room environments,
and most of all provide that underground feeling associated with
underground music.

Second, Koala-tea brings on their skills and makes it possible for some
of our big bookings for this show. Plus, Koala-tea is bringing out some
of their drum n bass talent, along with Pittsburgh's own Death x Stereo
crew, the drum n bass for this event will be off the hook.

Third, Electrasoul along with Electralight will be providing sound and
lighting for this event. With FOUR stages already confirmed and state of
the art lighting and visuals, this event holds lots of suprises for
everyone.

Last, local crews such as Nightvision and Full House represent most of
our local lineup for this event. Progressive House, break beats, techno,
all over the place, these crews will be sure to keep the crowd
movin...all night long.

Event runs from 9pm till 6am. Admission will be $20 all night plus on 
site, secure parking available. Vendors please contact Department of 
Energy at 412-708-0473 before May 31st. Any further questions please 
contact djkelvinhertz@yahoo.com

all went.
>You were murdered before I even saw you in 1st grade.  I didn't
get to

were all

murdered before

go to a

can't

out of your
>mother's womb and thrown in the trash before you could even cry.  And
>you're still going to be dead as I get into middle age, and then
old age.
>You won't be there to talk to on the porch of the retirement home in

together.

>I was born in 1977, four years after the Supreme Court legalized
ageist

>human being based on age.  Any human under the age of zero can be
murdered
>legally, for any reason whatsoever.  There have been an estimated
>46,023,191 ( http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/abortionstats.html )
>humans murdered since Roe vs Wade in 1973.  In just the year I
was born,
>there were between 1,079,430 and 1,316,700
>( http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/abortionstats.html ) people
who would
>be my age now thrown in the trash.  The number of live births in
1977 was
>3,326,632 ( http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005067.html ).

people.
>The 1980s portion of Generation Y is missing around FIFTEEN MILLION

better way to

They didn't

killed off a

like there arent plenty of kids who actually care about and play
good music who could be playing instead of someone who is
obviously on the nonsense tip. honestly, who listens to breaks at
all anymore? even the new school breaks crew seems to have died
down significantly. 

if you wanna see some kids who know what the fuck is up, go to
havana tonight and next thursday.

Who listens to breaks anymore?  What are you talking about?
Have the people buying new records in Pgh died, or something?

Seriously, there's been some good shit coming out, possibly for the
first time in a few years.

Breaks are still a large part of the music scene. It
just is not around here. England is still blowing it
up. Its dissolved into the dreaded "multi-genre"
breaks. Gone are the days of kevin beber or others
like him. Evil Nine just played a couple of weeks ago
at the hob and its was dope! At the WMC this year
electro breaks were the "hot shit". There are not too
many "true nu-skool" crews around this area tho. So
while pb/cle may not be jumping with the breakbeat
massive, there is still a devout following who come
out the woodwork occasionally.

Subject: {pb-cle} Drug Vaccines & ID Cards Promise Total Social Control

Drug Vaccines & ID Cards Promise Total Social Control

British authorities announced this week that they're to hold feasibility 
studies
on the practicalities of using vaccines against 'pleasure drugs', including 
the
question whether such inoculations should become compulsory.

"Drugs that are taken, both legally and illegally, for hedonistic reasons, 
and
that can lead to addiction, may in the future be controlled, their use
prevented, and addiction treated, by biochemical vaccines," the Foresight
Project's outline proposal explains. "The intention is to make the addict 
unable
to experience the 'high' or the first-time user unable to become addicted."

"Furthermore, questions arise as to what drugs should be targeted, including
both sanctioned (eg alcohol and cigarettes) and illegal drugs (eg cocaine);
whether the vaccine should be permanent or temporary; and to what other 
purpose
a vaccine may be used for (eg treating gambling or for producing social
conformity)," they add.

One of the key scientists involved in the new project is Professor David 
Nutt,
who enthusiastically endorsed anti-pleasure vaccines last July, when the
Independent newspaper suggested the UK government was planning a nationwide
anti-drug immunisation scheme similar to those used for infectious diseases.

"People could be vaccinated against drugs at birth as you are against 
measles,"
the Bristol University head of psychopharmacology told the paper, "You could 
say
cocaine is more dangerous than measles, for example," he claimed.

Details of the new vaccination study emerged just as British authorities
admitted they're seeking to introduce computer files and unique ID codes for
every newborn baby, a move even the News Of The World referred to this week 
as
an 'astonishing Big Brother plan'.

"Government ministers will seek new powers that will allow them access to 
almost
every aspect of someone's life," the tabloid warned, "In time (the computer
database) will contain details of their health, any benefits and criminal
record. It will also log where they have travelled to in the world, their
addresses, car numbers and credit history."

http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1375584,00.html ('We may fret
about illegal immigration and improper use of the NHS, but the national 
identity
register, which will include adults' fingerprints and an electronic scan of 
the
face or iris, as well as date of birth and address, is the tyrant's ideal 
means
of control. ..' The Guardian, January 2005)

Subject: {pb-cle} Compulsory Snitch Laws Threaten Police State USA

Compulsory Snitch Laws Threaten Police State USA

Civil liberties campaigners from the Drugs Policy Alliance (DPA) stepped up
their campaign against Congressman Sensenbrenner's barbarically draconian 
drugs
bill H.R. 1528 this week, highlighting its mandatory sentences for snitching
refuseniks.

"This bill would have serious consequences for our democracy, requiring you 
to
spy on all your neighbours, including going undercover and wearing a wire if
needed," DPA chief Bill Piper warned. "Refusing to become a spy for the
government would be punishable by a mandatory prison sentence of at least 
two
years."

"We are especially concerned about a section of the bill that turns every
American into an agent of the state," Mr Piper continued, going on to list a
number of typical offences people will be required to inform on, by law.

"You see someone you know pass a joint to a 20-year old college student: 
Your
cousin mentions that he bought Ecstasy for some of his college friends: You 
find
out that your brother, who has kids, recently bought a small amount of 
marijuana
to share with his wife: In each of these cases you face jail time if you 
don't
call the police within 24 hours," he said.

"It doesn't matter if the offender is your friend or relative. It also 
doesn't
matter if you need 48 hours to think about it. You have to report the person 
to
the government within 24 hours or go to jail."

Senator Sensenbrenner's Bill also proposes mandatory minimum jail terms for
every federal offence including clubbers violating the RAVE act three times, 
who
could soon be facing mandatory life sentences without parole

I'm staying in Bay City, about 80 minutes away.  I figure I'll be safe that
way.

BTW, if you kids feel like taking a night from techno (hahahhahahahaa, ah, I
crack me up), I'll be doing a breaks set @ the Roseville Theatre on
Saturday, courtesy of Nemesis Productions.

Subject: {pb-cle} Where did you get your passports?

Just curious..

I know a few of you guys have trips planned this year, or have at one time
went outside the country. Were about did you get your passports
from?.. and did you do it online, or within your local city? How long did
it take to recieve it?

Im looking into getting one, and planning a trip to London to see some
friends. I thought maybe getting some helpful ideas from you would be
more effective.

Thanks guys..

US Post Office.  One to two months.  Faster if you expedite it.  Also,
the county courthouse downtown.  You need some combination of your
birth certificate, social security card, and driver's license, and you
need a check written out to them for some very specific amount.

If you need it very quickly, there are ways to do it faster (3-5
days), but you're looking at a lot more cash.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Where did you get your passports?...walkingstick sez

when you go downtown to the county courthouse, you will actually need to 
bring 2 seperate checks along with all yr various forms of ID....you 
should really call them first just to be 100% on all the stuff you will 
need so you do it right the first time....i think for like a hundred some 
dollars you can put the rush on it, or you can pay like $70 and get it in 
about 2 months........if you go to the US gov.'s site, you can download 
all the forms you'll need...then depending on where you planning to 
travel, you may need to get a visa ahead of time to enter that country, in 
which case i recommend travisa.com........it's all pretty simple,and yr 
passport is good for like 12 years!!!
peace  Brian

I got my passport about a month ago.  As far as I know you can't do it onli=
ne.  The easiest way is to go to the Post Office, you can get them there.  =
You will also need to get passport photos taken.  You can get them done at =
some post offices or at a lot of photo places as well.  I think that the to=
tal cost of the photos and passport if you get them at the post office is j=
ust above $100(I think it cost 112 total or something like that).  It can t=
ake six weeks to get the passport(thats the timeframe they tell you), but I=
 got mine in about 3 weeks.  http://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_1738=
=2Eht=
ml is a good website for info, should also give you listings of places t=
o get passports and all that as well.=20=20

Bailey
// da drum and bass punisher// metalheadz, swerve, intasound


Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey?s South London stomping
ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, DJing at
house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the mellow hip hop of
the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and harder; Acid House ?
the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the rave scene. It was on
this acid house path, in around ?91 that he found a turning for hardcore,
inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of this road he entered the
door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate station
?Energy FM?. It was his ability on that very station that impressed Kemistry
and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play at one of the first
Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. Through moving on the
circuit Bailey joined forces with other influential South London selectors
and MC?s, forming the Inta Natty crew which consisted of himself,
Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known for
managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin? Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm and
Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by playing
in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America
and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has been all over the
mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some of which include: One
Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric Live, The End,
Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldie?s club Metalheadz and
Fabio?s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people want
has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting line up,
every Sunday night (11pm ? 1am) and in 2003 he won the award for ?Best Radio
Show? at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for many
projects including mixed CD?s for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of Sound,
France?s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass record
store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size & A
Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja and in
2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing tracks from
cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he has
the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an impression
and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ?s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to ?
recognition and respect.

to go just to be safe.

I guess you can also get your pics taken at AAA for cheap.  Was  
looking at it earlier and they specifically mentioned that the  
pictures taken at photo booths may not be suitable because of all the  
specifications it has to meet.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Where did you get your passports?

Office Max's, Copy Max takes passport photos.  They are kinda expensive, 
like 15.00 (guessing) but it's done right.  When I got mine I went through 
here:

                            http://iafdb.travel.state.gov/

This will help you.

Subject: {pb-cle} bsp: reaktor fiddle

No, its not electronic bluegrass (which I have promised, doh), yet some 
reaktor fiddling. Some people liked it, I don't think its finished, but 
I don't have time to finish it (or for much of effing anything).

Any wow factor is that every sample you hear is some kind of 
bastardization of Nick S' 808 sample set, fed through  a few instances 
of Krypt.

It's a mashup/glitch tune.

Yes, mashup makers always list their source material.  (see below)

You mean NOT letting you know about it?  I actually was going to email you  
(I have your old email addy @betarecordings) tonight, as I finished it  
last night and had to work all day (just got home).

Mashups are only "released" in mp3...it's all mp3/CD stuff.

Cool, cool.  I got bored with making "proper" drum n bass, so I've been  
dabbling in the mashup/bootleg scene for a few months now.  I don't have  
the motivation, energy, or time anymore to sit around for two days just  
making one sound so the "junglists" will think I'm "cool"  (you know what  
I mean), but I still wanna bang out some stuff for fun.  Hence the mashup  
stuff.

I'd like to hear what you made for mashups, btw  :)

A lot of ravers have no idea that a mashup scene even EXISTS, I think  
that's why Jea thought I was pawning something off as my own that is just  
a mash.  This is my original post (on the bootleg boards (www.gybo.org)  
and a few rave lists):


"Ahhh, my first glitchy tune.  This was damn fun to make.  Wanted to make
something for the summer, something latin-ish, and something drum n
bass-ish, so here ya go!


DJ Entropy - Mexican Caramba
http://djentropy.com/tracks/mashes/DJ_Entropy_-_Mexican_Caramba.mp3

John B - Ay Caramba!
Manu Chao - Bongo Bong
Wall Of Voodoo - Mexican Radio
Manu Chao - Me Gustas Tu



Enjoy, y'all :) "

To you as well.  Keep up the great work, I'm glad someone still has the  
energy to keep pushing things in different places.  :)

Subject: {pb-cle} selling my old tables - PB-CLE special

Selling my old tables; I need to liquidate because I'm buying a house
and I don't really spin anymore, just produce mostly these days.

2 Technics MK IIs - they have always worked very good.  They have some
stickers on them, but otherwise good condition.  Oh yeah one of them
has a classic Thieveland 216 sticker from the early 90s on it.  I can
send pictures to anyone interested in them.  Please note I have some
covers for them, and they work but the covers are rather beat-up.

Includeds 2 Ortofon Pro S cartidge heads - the long black ones with
the red dot, spherical i think - Pro SSS.  Best for recording if you
ask me.  One of the heads has the little lift arm broke off, but other
wise functional.  Only comes with 1 stylus though, and only one velvet
case the heads came in.

I'll also throw in a gheto gemini MX-7700.  It has some issues and
even works some of the time.  Its from the 80s with the bubble leds on
the indicators.  No slider caps or knobs anymore, only posts, lol.  Oh
yeah, has some huge toggles modded into it.  I suggest using a
different mixer, but can be used as a last resort if you don't have
one.

I'll throw in a black zip-up technics sweatshirt featuring a big
turntable on the back and technics on the front.  You can be the new
superstar DJ on your block.  Act now!

=3DP

asking $485 cash, just mention PB-CLE in your email - free delivery to
anywhere in the Cleveland area, or you can come pick them up in the
cleveland area.  This is the PB-CLE starter dj special. Who knows,
maybe I'll throw in a couple records and show you how to beat match.=20
You could be the next Tom Cox! Well at least you can dream you could
be ;)  I learned on these, and have owned them for 10 years - they've
treated me good.

Reply to garudasoul@gmail.com and I'll send you pics or answer any
questions.  Sorry about my sales humer, I am a jaded oldschool lurker
- this is a real offer if anyone is interested.

-Ridley

Pardon me, let me specify my reasoning:

I basically am stating that he was very ....ooh..i need a new logic
book...college terms are fading away....
Basically, you can?t say that everyone who supports this country is a dum
dum because they joined the army to serve the cause. Many people that join
the army are not faced with the tasks and responsibilities of any level of
government high above them, so they cant be blamed for ?dumb ideas? that
they are being ushered are the right ones.

This guy would make more sense if he said a certain number died that were
enlisted after the war in Iraq began, but still it would be completely
discriminating to the cause. He sounds like he?s French. They hate our
Freedom Chips (Trademarked).

Au revoir!

Ps Am I getting on my way to law school?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} bsp: reaktor fiddle

Synthetic Drums 2 is totally off the wall, its worth it for the Chris 
Liebing kits alone.

The Reaktor improvements are mostly in the core of the program, there's 
some workflow enhancements, like a better sample browser and new user 
interface niceties, but the VM is what's going to totally change the way 
people work with it. People will finally be able to use more than one or 
two ensembles at a time on the Mac. I had to "make the switch" to a PC 
to be able to use and record things like Limelite, Green Matrix, or 
Photone at the same time (that is, record one of those while it played).

The amount of quality tools available today is absolutely insane, and 
things are finally the way they should be... you can use pretty much 
whatever you personally prefer and get the same results in the high end 
of things.

I've never been a fan of Max/MSP, its always been a little "out there" 
if you ask me, while its a great program, I don't want to ever be put in 
the category of people who tweak one bad patch for two hours and call it 
music. While I've known its capable of pretty much anything (and really, 
anything), I've never been able to get past that aspect of it until I 
saw a clip of Jamie Lidell using his Max setup live... effing blew me away.

If you haven't seen what I'm talking about, its not really music geeky 
at all, in fact he does rnb (be it his own sort of flavor)... here's the 
clip, prepare to be blown away, while I prepare to answer the "I WANNA 
DO THAT OMFGOGGLES" questions that will undoubtably follow.

ps. Ed, I am not putting you off, I'm just trying to figure out wtf 
you're trying to do in my head. Damn the windows clients, full speed ahead.

aspire to be as great as Tom Cox, yet never actually obtain that goal.

I'm down with that.  He's a very good producer.  He deffinately knows
how to use a 303 and 909 - nice and minimal.  I've got a few of his
old records, awsome stuff.

-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

BURUFUNK
LIVE DIGITAL MIX // GODSEND MUSIC
WWW.BURUFUNK.COM // WWW.GODSENDMUSIC.COM
DEEP PROGRESSIVE TECHNOLOGY

Amidst the thousands of artists and producers that work in the EDM 
industry today, Curtis and Leaha are of the few who strive to create 
truly original musical compositions. The live Progressive Breakbeat duo 
has been shredding the airwaves, dance floors, and club scene with their 
exceptional productions and intense performances. Their impeccable 
fusion of harmonious melodies and earth shaking beats creates a unique 
style and sound that cannot be matched.

Burufunk is best known for their chart topping remixes which include: BT 
"Somnambulist" (Nettwerk), Deepsky "Talk like a Stranger" (Yoshi Toshi), 
and Wrecked Angle "Back to Babylon" (Electrofly) which had remained in 
the Balance Record Pool top 20 for more than ten weeks. They were also 
recognized as one of the winners in the BPM Magazine Remix Contest for 
their rendition of BT's "The Great Escape". Their most recent remix 
collaboration had them working with BT to create: BT vs The Doors "Break 
on Through (To the Other Side)..

Their signature tracks have been heavily supported by the likes of Paul 
Oakenfold, BT, Deepsky, Hybrid and DJ Icey to name a few. Likewise, 
their first release together "Outsider" was featured on Global 
Underground 024 'Reykjavik' mixed by Nick Warren. Look to Godsend Music 
for more Burufunk material launching this summer as well as an upcoming 
album in the works.

So much can be said about these visionaries... but their music is 
something words cannot express.

JAIA (Digital Structures . France) LIVE!
The act JAIA is the project of  the French producer Yannis Kamarinos, 
formed in 1995 with Jean-Michel Blanchet and first oriented  Psy-Trance 
and Downtempo.  Since 2000 Yannis is working alone under JAIA name,  and 
today JAIA.s music is more orientated to Progressive House and 
Progressive Trance (and still Downtempo too).  JAIA has already released 
an album .Blue Energy. in 1998 (Cross/EastWest/Nova Tekk), which has 
been re-released in 2000 on the Japanese label Dakini.  JAIA released 
several 12" singles too, as well as numerous tracks on various label 
compilations, such as  Island, Iboga, Wagram, Milan, Flying Rhino, 
T.I.P. World, and many others.  The new album "Fiction" will be released 
in May 2005 on Digital Structures.  Yannis has collaborated with other 
producers-DJ.s such as DADO, WIZY NOISE, and SILICON SOUND.  He has 
remixed famous artists like the French singer MYLENE FARMER . including 
her last two singles "C.est Une Belle Journe" and "Pardonne-Moi" 
(Polydor/Unive
 rsal) -
with BLUE PLANET CORPORATION, the Moroccan singer TYOUSSI 
(Fairway/SonyMusic), and the French pop band JPEX (Wagram). JAIA also 
has been remixed by TOTAL ECLIPSE, MINIL:OGUE, and JIMMY VAN M for 
example.  He is also working with Oneletronic, a company making sound 
libraries for cinema and TV, collaborating with other artists like JOHN 
DIGWEED, OLIVER LIEB, NICK WARREN, and SASHA.  Since 1997 Yannis has

States.  He has played at many big gatherings like Return to the Source 
in London, Solstice in Japan, and the Samothraki Dance Festival in 
Greece.

ANTIX (Iboga Records . New Zealand) LIVE!
Based in Auckland New Zealand, Barton and Hayden Strom are the producers 
behind the project ANTIX.  The Strom brother.s dedication to pushing 
their style in new directions in the ever evolving Progressive Trance 
genre has made them one of the emerging acts to watch for in their 
scene.  Both Barton and Hayden were introduced to music at a young age 
listening, to music from their parent.s vast record collections.  They 
quickly became addicted to the hypnotic sounds of Trance in '95 when a 
friend handed them a tape urging them to check it out.  Barton instantly 
purchased a mixer and started DJ'ing at small parties in the growing 
Auckland scene.  Six months later he had moved to Japan to buy studio 
equipment and teach himself the art of production, and Hayden later 
joined him.  Together they returned to New Zealand, setting up various 
studios around Auckland and refining a sound, which really came together 
once they moved to the West Coast of the North Island and set up Slow 
Burn
 ing
Studios in '99.  The sound that seemed to evolve was a kind of minimal 
organic groove influenced by the European sound being played by DJ 
PHILIPP from Plastik Park and ANTI from Spiral Trax.  It wasn't long 
before a connection was made when Philipp toured Australia and New 
Zealand in 2000, and ANTIX were signed for their first 12", "Rainstick," 
on Plastik Park.  Over the years the two have managed to put a few of 
the "big ones" under their belts, playing the U-Site Fusion Festival in 
Germany, The Boom in Portugal, and The Rainbow Serpent in Australia.  
And now three years down the line, ANTIX completed their long awaited 
debut album "Lull" released on the Danish label Iboga Records.  The duo 
are currently touring the globe for the third year, they are only half 
way to completing this tour, but so far its been a huge success, playing 
parties in Denmark, Sweden, Croatia, Japan, the Voov Festival 2003 in 
Germany and then in London, where they played alongside other respected 
kiw
 i
artists for the annual New Zealand music night at club Fabric.  And now 
to continue the tour ANTIX will play in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Austria and then to finish in France.  On top 
of this they.ve also been involved in Auckland label Manta.  The label 
has just released its second 12" and third compilation "Subduction" 
featuring a excellent selection of New Zealand and international, 
Progressive/Psy-Trance which are all available from Cyberculture Records 
at (www.cyberculture.co.nz).  So at last...  Here comes the second full 
length album from ANTIX - "Twin Cost Discovery."  Since their first 
album - "Lull" - released on Iboga Records in June 2003, ANTIX had major 
success with their very groovy and unique style.  They have been playing 
their live set at a great number of events and have made a very good 
name for themselves in the scene.  Now two years later, Iboga Records is 
proud to be releasing another well produced album.  From start to end
  the
Strom brothers take you on a journey deep into their soundscapes.  You 
can truly tell that ANTIX has spent many hours making this album come 
true, and once again they surprise with their style, going in a new 
direction.

DEVIANT SPECIES (Ambivalent Records . London) LIVE!
DEVIANT SPECIES are the England based electronic duo who are currently 
touring Japan consisting of Santos De Castro and Paul Wright.  
Consistently releasing their unique take on the London Techno sound for 
the past five years, they are now preparing to release their third 
album, "In the Hands of the Randomiser," later this year on Ambivalent 
Records.  From the Warlock Studios comes the long-awaited album by 
DEVIANT SPECIES.  No need for introductions, once more you will be 
treated to nine quality-consistent cuts of dark and minimal psychedelia 
for the blackest hours of the night.  In this third album installment by 
DEVIANT SPECIES the band is now only made up of Santos De Castro with 
collaborations with ex-DEVIANT SPECIES member Paul Konrad Wright (now of 
N.R.S. fame) and ground-breaking producer Ady Connor from SCORB.  The 
atmosphere prevailing here is hard, with tinges of Industrial and 
Ambient intros and outros that cross-over giving the album a continuous 
flow.  It all ki
 cks off
with "Voice of Thard," a chugging and spatial number that builds up to a 
ripping chorus.  "Pincushion Man" continues with galloping intensity 
where "...Thard" left off moving relentlessly to a climatic final before 
"Shellless" ebbs in soothingly with an overture of peerless Gothic 
beauty.  The tight pulse is quickly restored leading to a frantic groove 
that allows you to breathe with its interspersed waves of noise.  On a 
slightly softer tip "Thermal Boundaries" follows with an infectious beat 
that gradually gathers momentum to trancing-out effect.  In a similar 
rolling yet relaxed vein enters "The Retinal Circus," which has been 
doing the bootleg rounds in an earlier unfinished version titled "The 
Abyss."  To follow, "In the Hands of the Randomiser" is the first 
collaboration between DEVIANT SPECIES and SCORB, a powerful track that 
starts with an Industrial soundscape and steamrolls forward into a 
roaring pay-off.  For the darkest hour "A Night to Dismember" brings the 
proce
 edings
to total mayhem before the forces of light emerge.  "Portal to Balojax" 
is a 3-minute-plus unwinding ambient piece and serves as a prologue to 
"The Entrapment of John Dory," the only morning track in the album and 
the second DEVIANT SPECIES vs. SCORB outing, a delicate cut destined to 
be a classic.

Sat Jul 23                   LAWNCHAIR GENERALS                   Cleveland

Coming to Wish Saturday July 23rd

LawnChair Generals (Viva, Westbound, Lowdown)

Seattle transplants Peter Christianson and Carlos Mendoza, better known 
as the Lawnchair Generals, have been generating beats out of their 
self-made studio for the past two years. Based on the brief amount of 
time the duo has spent manning the controls, the success they have 
attained is staggering. As goes the old adage, it is quality, not 
quantity that breeds such success; along with their blinding talent, 
both behind the decks and in the studio, and a little luck thrown in for 
good measure, the Generals have blazed their way into the record crates 
of the world's top DJs and onto internationally distributed mixes 
compiled by the industry's most prolific jocks. "The egalitarian nature 
of this industry is what allows us to completely transcend the fact that 
we're from a town that has been mostly rock oriented," says Carlos. "It 
allows us to be on equal footing with people who have been making great 
house music for a long time."

Lawn Chair Generals likely represent the next creative event in 
underground house music, a sound carefully crafted unlike much of the 
slapped together economy of the dance music prevelant to date. Carlos 
Mendoza and Peter Christianson met in 2000 and almost immediatelly began 
experimenting with the possibilities of house music. Their very first 
experiment yielded their first release on Viva Recordings, "The Great 
Escape". The pair was pleasantly surprised when this release garnered 
the praise of national and worldwide heavyweights alike. Charted in 
publications by the likes of Mark Farina and Colin Dale of the BBC, and 
broken out on dance floors by Johnny Fiasco, DJ Heather, Doc Martin, Rob 
Mello and more all over the world, their "West Coast meets Chicago" 
sound has garnered this pair more attention than they expected...Remixes 
for Viva, Deepfunk and Amenti extend this duo's sound to the works of 
other emerging underground talents such as Hanna, Rhythm Slaves and 
Alexander East.

Bailey
[[[Metalheadz, 1Xtra, Swerve, Intasound]]]
UK

Born and raised in South London DJ Bailey has been exposed to the 
contemporary underground scene since the age of 11. His passion of beats 
started with Hip Hop in the early eighties. Bailey.s South London 
stomping ground was littered with sound systems, one of which he joined, 
DJing at house parties and making mix tapes.Becoming bored with the 
mellow hip hop of the late eighties Bailey discovered something new and 
harder; Acid House . the culture which engulfed him, leading him to the 
rave scene. It was on this acid house path, in around .91 that he found 
a turning for hardcore, inspired by the breakbeat element. At the end of 
this road he entered the door for Drum & Bass.

Bailey was soon gaining steam as a DJ by playing on a local pirate 
station .Energy FM.. It was his ability on that very station that 
impressed Kemistry and Storm, resulting in them inviting Bailey to play 
at one of the first Metalheadz club nights at the old Blue Note in 1996. 
Through moving on the circuit Bailey joined forces with other 
influential South London selectors and MC.s, forming the Inta Natty crew 
which consisted of himself, Grooverider and MC Flux amongst others.
Bailey soon joined the Groove Connection booking agency which is known 
for managing Fabio, Grooverider, Jumpin. Jack Frost, Bryan Gee, Storm 
and Calibre.
His bookings have brought him to conquer the world of Drum & Bass by 
playing in South Africa, Japan, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, 
Canada, America and the majority of Europe. As for the UK, Bailey has 
been all over the mainland showcasing his DJ skills at many events, some 
of which include: One Nation, AWOL, Movement, Creamfields, Valve, Fabric 
Live, The End, Dreamscape, Slamming Vinyl not forgetting Goldie.s club 
Metalheadz and Fabio.s club Swerve both at which he is a resident.

His gift for precision and his natural intuition for what the people 
want has lead BBC 1Xtra to secure Bailey as part of their core starting 
line up, every Sunday night (11pm . 1am) and in 2003 he won the award 
for .Best Radio Show. at the Knowledge Drum and Bass Awards.

Always having a flare for mix tapes Bailey was the natural choice for 
many projects including mixed CD.s for Knowledge Magazine, Ministry of 
Sound, France.s Black label with MC GQ and Americas premier Drum & Bass 
record store Breakbeat Science.

Bailey has also delved into production completing remixes for Roni Size 
& A Guy Called Gerald gaining the interest of Valve label boss Dillinja 
and in 2004, set up his underground D&B label Intasound, releasing 
tracks from cutting edge acts such as Equinox and Miracle.

Bailey is now an established necessity to the Drum & Bass fraternity, he 
has the capacity to create a sound through sheer mixology to make an 
impression and stand out from the crowd of Drum & Bass DJ.s out there.
His skills have gained him the accolade that every DJ aspires to . 
recognition and respect.

As most of you already know, The Mattress Company Arts Center is gone.  
An electrical fire burned out beloved building and all of its contents 
to the ground in under an hour, leaving 4 people homeless and 3 others 
without a place to do business.

In an effort to help these folks, we are organizing a benefit on Friday 
May 27th at Cedar's starting at 8 pm and going through to 2 am.  The 
best of the best in the Youngstown music scene have already signed on 
to perform, we currently have 5 bands scheduled.  We are also going to 
be holding a Chinese Auction of artwork from the pool of amazing 
artists in Youngstown.  The auction will begin on Friday night and end 
on Sunday afternoon at 4 pm with a drawing to be held at Cedar's Cafe 
and the winners need not be present.  All proceeds will go to the 
victims of  the fire.  The Chinese auction is an excellent chance to 
pick up some really fantastic artwork as the YMCAC held a special place 
in the hearts of Youngstown artists and we are all donating some truly 
spectacular pieces.

There will be a minimum $5 donation at the door on Friday night 
although people are encouraged to donate as much as they would like.  
These folks need things like toothbrushes, shoes, clothing, etc.  
Nothing was saved from the building and all they have are the clothes 
they were wearing.  If you have clothing that you don't wear anymore, 
donations are welcomed at the benefit.

There will be updates on the event at http://www.sarabella.net/blog 
with info on the bands playing and the artists participating in the 
auction.

Yeah...Jamie Lidell is doing some really cool stuff. I am looking forward t=

his new album quite a bit.

makes me realize that if I were to study it long enough...I would be able t=

I mean just look at things like Ms.Pinky=20
http://www.cycling74.com/products/mspinky.html

Who wants Final Scratch when you can simultaneously scratch audio and video=

files in sync.

Before Ableton Live was what it is today...it was a patch in MAX/MSP.

For me...MAX/MSP would be something to master for all the doors it would=20
open up...rather than a bragging right to say...yeah I use MAX/MSP.

So far though...out of the box...I have accomplished more and had more=20
enjoyment using Plogue Bidule than MAX/MSP. Its a bit more intuitive right=

max only. I am not sure if that is something I want to do.

re : Synthetic Drums
I really like the Funkstorung kits as well. Tons of great kits.

Subject: {pb-cle} DJ Entropy - One Evil Piano (Metallica, Billy Joel, Coheed, Journey)

Since you all think I'm lame for using a John B tune, here's something WAY  
different:  A 3/4 bit in some form of B minor (heh).  I made an edited  
version
of this one that is only four a half minutes instead of six (yowzers!) by
taking out two of the tracks used as well:


DJ Entropy - One Evil Piano
<http://djentropy.com/tracks/mashes/DJ_Entropy_-_One_Evil_Piano.mp3>
Metallica - One
Coheed and Cambria - Everything Evil
Billy Joel - Piano Man
Journey - Lights


DJ Entropy - One Evil Piano (edit)
<http://djentropy.com/tracks/mashes/DJ_Entropy_-_One_Evil_Piano_(edit).mp3>
Metallica - One
Coheed and Cambria - Everything Evil

"And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy

If anyone happens to stay in tonight...or if you're in the mood for some 
sounds after you get home, I'll be broadcasting live from O2 tonight on 
Breakbeat Militia Radio. 2:30 AM - 5:30 AM

http://radio.breakbeatmilitia.com

(there is a link to listen at the top of the page...or simply open: 
http://listen.breakbeatmilitia.com in your your mp3 player. Winamp or WMP)

First 2 hours will be house and the last will be breaks.

This is the first week I've done this, so tune in and let me know how it 
sounds!

Moose

P:S: BBM radio is always playing...I'll just be switching the streams at 
2:30 ish

			Detroit=Wow.

Is this town always this cool??

Back to cleveland tonight.  

For anyone interested, I'm doing a six hour ambient set at The Proper Alternative tonight.  Mostly Live PA mixed with some digital recordings.  

Interesting thought though,

I noticed psy-trance was mentioned in a previous post about  alot of new psy-trance isn't released to vinyl.  I've noticed the same with ambient.  

I know, I know

"No one listens to ambient"

Well,

I don't listen to anyone.

It's gonna be a cool one tonight.

I hope some poeple get burnt out as fuck from the main room, and come chill with me for a minute.  That's what I'll be there for.

If not

Well me, the walls, and the sound system will get along just fine.

I designed that flier!  That was my favorite fractal, I believe it
might be a Julian set.  Thanks to fractint!  The messages on it were
from EPT of course.  Yeah that party was a miricle it happened.  First
venue got shut down and locked up, then second venue got shut down in
that country club because of the noise, then the party broke back into
first venue and kept it going strong, and of course, they passed out
flavored icey pops for the inconvienience.  Definately hardcore.

Yes you provided a positive id - fractal indeed.  Round flyer with 
black and white fractal with silver writing.  Nice!  What a small 
world?

Who is EPT?

I don't remember any mishaps - other than I arrived way too early 
9:00pm and the party started a little late.  12:30am when the sound 
system finally turned on.  I believe it was on the basketball court 
of some park.  A fenced in area with a small indoor pavilion.

Are you still doing flyers?  Have a gallery online?  Want a scan the 
"miracles" flyer for the memory box??

Banged this one out tonight.  Honestly, I'm really surprised no one has
done this before.  It was in my head all weekend, so I had to do it.
Enjoy!

Yeah, I'm still half awake, my feet are killing me, and my ears are  
sore from taking ear plugs in and out... but I had a blast, and think  
everyone else in our li'l posse did as well.  Definately a lot better  
than last year.  Although we were only there for part of one day.   
This one I've heard techno out the wazoo.  Really digging the  
industrial clinking and clanking stuff that I haven't really heard  
before.  Didn't hear that much on the last day though.  I'll try and  
go through the pictures tonight, but I only see a lot of sleeping  
happening tonight.

In a word, tronic.  god damn.  that lineup couldn't
possibly happened anywhere else in the states in a
venue of that size (maybe 1000 capacity the way it was
laid out between four rooms).  5+ hours of Adam beyer
and Marco Carola made me a very happy boy...they both
were head and shoulders above everyone else at that
party IMO, and that includes Mistress Barbara, Ben
Simms, and Christian Smith amoung others.

Other things that made me happy:  the last 45 minutes
of Mat Jonson's set at the paxahau party.  Pheek and
Akufen at the underground stage.  Model 500.  Beyer at
the underground stage (absolutely stomping set...he
played a lot more minimal and electro/acid at tronic
IMO).  Punisher at the underground stage...interesting
use of rythm and a set unlike anything I've heard
before...and then she played a minimal version of
jungle for the last half of her set...again,
interesting.

There were tons of others but those are the ones that
stick in my head at the moment.

Subject: {pb-cle} maternity leave

I will be going on maternity leave starting on Monday, 6/06.  My due date is on
Wednesday, 6/15.  I will be temporarily unsubbing from the list this coming
Friday (my last day of work) because I only have access to the internet here at
work.  I will be returning to work on Monday 9/12, and will resub to the list
then.

Hope to see some of you at P.U.M.P. and Crop Circles!:)

Can I say a giant ditto on all that below....tronic was unreal.  I loved Punishers set at the festival. Anyone know what Korg machine she's using now?  I found that very interesting.. the break dances on the mainstage in the middle of the day Sunday were cool, almost the rest of the tronic stage stuff, and what little I could hear of Saunderson from our vantage point.  ....  I need to look at the lineups at tronics more....Ben Sims and Smith were great, and so were Carola and Beyer (my gooodness!!)  The venue was hilarious....but the tronic people were really on the ball....who needs a flashlight when they're walking around with 20 of them.
 
I also loved the good old view from the Pontch..we had 24th floor overlooking the entire festival.  

Jamie Tyler <jhtyler@sbcglobal.net> wrote: 
In a word, tronic. god damn. that lineup couldn't
possibly happened anywhere else in the states in a
venue of that size (maybe 1000 capacity the way it was
laid out between four rooms). 5+ hours of Adam beyer
and Marco Carola made me a very happy boy...they both
were head and shoulders above everyone else at that
party IMO, and that includes Mistress Barbara, Ben
Simms, and Christian Smith amoung others.

Other things that made me happy: the last 45 minutes
of Mat Jonson's set at the paxahau party. Pheek and
Akufen at the underground stage. Model 500. Beyer at
the underground stage (absolutely stomping set...he
played a lot more minimal and electro/acid at tronic
IMO). Punisher at the underground stage...interesting
use of rythm and a set unlike anything I've heard
before...and then she played a minimal version of
jungle for the last half of her set...again,
interesting.

There were tons of others but those are the ones that
stick in my head at the moment.

Yeah that made getting to and from the room a big pain
in my ass...that and the pace at which the front desk
"works" are my only real bitches with that place - it
wasn't quite as bad as I expected given the horror

bomb or something similar into the stairwell near at
the end of our hall...pigfucker.

I always stayed at the ponch and friends of mine made sure thier room was as 
close to the ground this year as possible.  I think they beat all the other 
hotels in the area and that all you can eat breakfast buffet for like 10 
bucks is the shit after 10 hours of a party.

we saw him in louisville a few months ago, his set was good, but a little

old school was originally on a different day so we could have hit both,
but they changed it a few weeks ago.

Subject: {pb-cle} Tickets @ Milk

Kelly,

Who do I talk to about having presales available for sale @ Milk (for my
show in August)? If I dropped a line to the right person, just give me an
address I can mail them to, and also let me know your policy regarding
selling pre's, and I'll work on getting things wrapped up and tickets made
soon.

Thanks,

Alex

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Celebrating 10 years of "it isn't like it used to be"

EPT is Eternal Peace Tribe, originally Matt, Jill, and Brian and gang.
 Brian later split from them and formed UPS, underground peace society
that started the Family Affair parties, among many others.  I don't
think I've seen any of them on the list, ever.  Closest person on this
list at that time would have to be Jordana aka 187.

I still have a copy of that flier somewhere i think.  That would be
cool if you sent me scan, though.  I really didn't do many fliers.=20
Mostly just EPTs CGI fliers back in the day.  I did do a flip book
flier for Pulse's SHINE party that was really cool.  As it flipped, it
panned out from E to show the word SHINE light up.

There is no shame in that game.  Cubase or Logic is more flexible for

I always make faces I dunno why ;p

No patch saving.  It kinda makes you record more then you normally would =

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Celebrating 10 years of "it isn't like it used to be"

Just for reference...
Jill went on to New York to become a designer for
Caffine, this was years ago and she prolly moved on to
someting greater.

Brian is living in C-bus helping refugees get american
citasinships. I am pretty sure he hates "the scene",
but I heard he throws reggae show. JAH!

Matts prolly in jail or something.

I don't thing B. had anything to do with Maricles. By
then him and lee had begun their own thing, Riff Raff,
which was a record\clothing store in akron.

Brian was the driving force behind EPT and he left, I
presume, cause Matt was a complete dumbass. Pretty
much every event UPS threw was off the hook tho. They
were on top of the music and booked solid fresh acts. 


Its very unfortunate that kind of thing no longer
happens around here. I'd give anything to go to some
dirty warehouse and rave(lol) all night into the
morning when the sun starts coming thru the windows
and  only the most hardcore muthafuckas are still
hanging in there.

Didn't Maricles ended up finally at the old attik
building on the side that is now a porn theatre?
Good times long gone..........now we're all just jaded
ass ravers and music snobs.

the attik was my first exposure to the real stuff.  It could never happen 
again.  Remember that party that started out at some tennis court but then 
"moved" into that glass factory behind the attik?
