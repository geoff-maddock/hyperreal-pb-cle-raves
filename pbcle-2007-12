Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Dance music blogs

Wow. Nicely done, goose. I don't have most of those in my list.

I've got a couple more that I frequent and get more music than I can
possibly listen to in a reasonable amount of time.

Most of them trend toward hipster-ish electro/house sounds, but
Discobelle does occasionally do some indie, american hip-hop, and
disco-ish stuff.

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Tek0002 Net release party

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we bring you the latest 
release from our own Chad Dolis. Coming to help us celebrate this 
accomplishment is one of our very favorite riot makers, the 
infamous.........

Lee Curtiss 
(Kalimari,Dumb Unit, Mothership, Esperanza, Wolf+Lamb)

A Western Michigan native and long-time Detroit resident, Lee Curtiss 
has been forging his uniquely backwoods, yet avant-garde and primal 
brand of deep and twisted dance music since the late 1990.s. A 
constantly changing and ever-eager student to his craft, Lee.s finger 
has been pressed upon, if not thrust into, the throbbing aorta of 
underground dance music for quite some time . even if his production 
skills and brain-demolishing live PA have only recently begun to garner 
the attention of techno and house music.s elite. Growing up between the 
two poles of Chicago and Detroit organized Lee.s approach to production 
squarely between the grooving, deep house sounds of artists like Derrick 
Carter, and the mindfreaking work of techno producers such as Ricardo 
Villalobos, Zip (aka Dimbiman), Matthew Dear and Richie Hawtin. Over the 
past year Lee has begun to tour extensively in America and Europe, 
notoriously adhering to a 'fuck trends, fuck dance music, and fuck me' 
approach to producing and performing that only the strongest of stomachs 
and most iron-clad of minds can withstand. His music.s dark, sexy, and 
uncompromising singularity have earned him coveted performance slots at 
the 2007 DEMF and Mutek festivals, preludes to his upcoming summer move 
to Europe and a new commitment to touring and producing. Curtiss was 
recently named by Matthew Dear as one of they key figures of emerging 
talent in URB magazine.s next 100, but Lee would rather you quit reading 
this bio and either book him, buy his record, or come see him melt you 
and your friends faces at a club near you. 

Our version of the story:
For those who were there Lee made a special stop through with Ryan 
Crosson back in Feb 07 @ Touch. Well we decided that a guest appearance 
was not enough, we want the real deal. This dirty minded symbiote (half 
man, half techno) created out of the murky wasteland known as Detroit 
has come to symbolize the attitude we at Tek-Know hold so very dear and 
we can't wait to show you what attitude is all about.

Mon Dec 31                    TRI-STATE LOVE 2                        Cinci

In the Groove has been bringing you a different type of party for almost 
a decade now. We have always been known for bringing you the best talent 
(known and unknown) from the Midwest and beyond with a .POSITIVE. vibe, 
and this New Year.s Eve will be no different. The overwhelming support 
for the first Tri-State Love has set the stage for Tri-State Love 2. 
Only this time, we let you pick the lineup. From the count of votes from 
our MySpace bulletins, you, the party go-ers, picked this year.s .Local 
Headliners. party. You voted, we listened, and here is the lineup YOU 
picked. Many of us have spent so many years together in this scene, who 
better to bring in the New Year with, than those we consider our closest 
friends and the best of the best local DJ.s that have kept the Midwest 
scene rocking?

Plus, this year we have made it our personal mission to put our efforts 
from all of our events to a cause higher than ourselves. A portion of 
our proceeds will go to Roman Fariello, a child who is fighting for his 
life against neuroblastoma. For more information on Roman, 
neuroblastoma, and how you can help, visit www.rescueroman.org

Make sure to get there early! Some of your favorites may be going on 
earlier than others, and we want to be sure everyone is there in time to 
bring in the New Year together! As always, another quality event from In 
the Groove, featuring the best local talent you picked, the most insane 
light shows available complete with video screen backdrops, two 
thundering rooms of sound, and the return of a .Positive., legendary 
venue in Southwest Ohio. Three states, one region, one Love. Tri-State 
Love 2. December 31st, 2007.

Fri Apr 18                       CANDYBALL 4                            NYC

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

2008! The club is booked and with most of the planning, for our first 
two parties next year, done and in the books, I can spend the next month 
or so planning the lineup and theme for our 2nd Annual Halloween Candy 
Costume Ball!!!!

are they even available domestically for sale? i'm not into ebaying for one.

at first i was underwhelmed, but i really like the fact that it does
different scales and keys per preset. that's pretty damn slick.

that guy is pretty frickin' handy with the groove boxes, too. i doubt
my experimentations would turn out that good right out of the box.

Only place I've seen it (litterally, do a google product search for it)
is at htfr.com which is in the UK, but they are reputable, I get records
from them every so often.

http://www.htfr.com/more-info/MR237688

The sic-ness is it only costs 99 pounds.  The un-sic-ness is that
translates to $200 US.  But still pretty cheap for something you could
literally do full songs in (some of the "related" youtube videos aren't
bad either).  It's cheaper than a wii, and could probably have more fun
with that than guitar hero.  hmm...

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Tek0002 Net release party

For the next installment of Tek-Know @ Touch we bring you the latest 
release from our own Chad Dolis. Coming to help us celebrate this 
accomplishment is one of our very favorite riot makers, the 
infamous.........

Lee Curtiss 
(Kalimari,Dumb Unit, Mothership, Esperanza, Wolf+Lamb)

A Western Michigan native and long-time Detroit resident, Lee Curtiss 
has been forging his uniquely backwoods, yet avant-garde and primal 
brand of deep and twisted dance music since the late 1990.s. A 
constantly changing and ever-eager student to his craft, Lee.s finger 
has been pressed upon, if not thrust into, the throbbing aorta of 
underground dance music for quite some time . even if his production 
skills and brain-demolishing live PA have only recently begun to garner 
the attention of techno and house music.s elite. Growing up between the 
two poles of Chicago and Detroit organized Lee.s approach to production 
squarely between the grooving, deep house sounds of artists like Derrick 
Carter, and the mindfreaking work of techno producers such as Ricardo 
Villalobos, Zip (aka Dimbiman), Matthew Dear and Richie Hawtin. Over the 
past year Lee has begun to tour extensively in America and Europe, 
notoriously adhering to a 'fuck trends, fuck dance music, and fuck me' 
approach to producing and performing that only the strongest of stomachs 
and most iron-clad of minds can withstand. His music.s dark, sexy, and 
uncompromising singularity have earned him coveted performance slots at 
the 2007 DEMF and Mutek festivals, preludes to his upcoming summer move 
to Europe and a new commitment to touring and producing. Curtiss was 
recently named by Matthew Dear as one of they key figures of emerging 
talent in URB magazine.s next 100, but Lee would rather you quit reading 
this bio and either book him, buy his record, or come see him melt you 
and your friends faces at a club near you. 

Our version of the story:
For those who were there Lee made a special stop through with Ryan 
Crosson back in Feb 07 @ Touch. Well we decided that a guest appearance 
was not enough, we want the real deal. This dirty minded symbiote (half 
man, half techno) created out of the murky wasteland known as Detroit 
has come to symbolize the attitude we at Tek-Know hold so very dear and 
we can't wait to show you what attitude is all about.

Mon Dec 31                    TRI-STATE LOVE 2                        Cinci

In the Groove has been bringing you a different type of party for almost 
a decade now. We have always been known for bringing you the best talent 
(known and unknown) from the Midwest and beyond with a .POSITIVE. vibe, 
and this New Year.s Eve will be no different. The overwhelming support 
for the first Tri-State Love has set the stage for Tri-State Love 2. 
Only this time, we let you pick the lineup. From the count of votes from 
our MySpace bulletins, you, the party go-ers, picked this year.s .Local 
Headliners. party. You voted, we listened, and here is the lineup YOU 
picked. Many of us have spent so many years together in this scene, who 
better to bring in the New Year with, than those we consider our closest 
friends and the best of the best local DJ.s that have kept the Midwest 
scene rocking?

Plus, this year we have made it our personal mission to put our efforts 
from all of our events to a cause higher than ourselves. A portion of 
our proceeds will go to Roman Fariello, a child who is fighting for his

Fri Apr 18                       CANDYBALL 4                            NYC

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

or so planning the lineup and theme for our 2nd Annual Halloween Candy

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Mon Dec 31                    TRI-STATE LOVE 2                        Cinci

In the Groove has been bringing you a different type of party for almost 
a decade now. We have always been known for bringing you the best talent 
(known and unknown) from the Midwest and beyond with a .POSITIVE. vibe, 
and this New Year.s Eve will be no different. The overwhelming support 
for the first Tri-State Love has set the stage for Tri-State Love 2. 
Only this time, we let you pick the lineup. From the count of votes from 
our MySpace bulletins, you, the party go-ers, picked this year.s .Local 
Headliners. party. You voted, we listened, and here is the lineup YOU 
picked. Many of us have spent so many years together in this scene, who 
better to bring in the New Year with, than those we consider our closest 
friends and the best of the best local DJ.s that have kept the Midwest 
scene rocking?

Plus, this year we have made it our personal mission to put our efforts 
from all of our events to a cause higher than ourselves. A portion of 
our proceeds will go to Roman Fariello, a child who is fighting for his 
life against neuroblastoma. For more information on Roman, 
neuroblastoma, and how you can help, visit www.rescueroman.org

Make sure to get there early! Some of your favorites may be going on 
earlier than others, and we want to be sure everyone is there in time to 
bring in the New Year together! As always, another quality event from In 
the Groove, featuring the best local talent you picked, the most insane 
light shows available complete with video screen backdrops, two 
thundering rooms of sound, and the return of a .Positive., legendary 
venue in Southwest Ohio. Three states, one region, one Love. Tri-State 
Love 2. December 31st, 2007.

Fri Apr 18                       CANDYBALL 4                            NYC

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

Fri Jul 04                CANDYBALL: WE THE RAVERS                      NYC

Candyball: We The Ravers, is now scheduled for Friday July 4th, 2008! 
The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

Jul 18-19, 2008              HULLA REUNION 2008                     Toronto

[probably the opera house. a wonderously shittastic venue]

Hullabaloo reunion 2008!!! :)
Yes! there will be a Hulla next summer

www.hulla.info

The next Hullabaloo reunion date is the weekend of July 18th and 19th, 
2008.

It's hard to argue with how fast tickets sold out for OMGH, but the 
party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs

Daniel Bell [DBX]
Daniel Bell is considered to be one of the pioneers of the minimal techno
genre. Born in Sacramento, California, Bell grew up outside of Toronto, and
later moved to Detroit where he collaborated with Richie Hawtin as
Cybersonik for three years on Plus 8 records. In 1991, he started his own
label, Accelerate, where he released a string of extremely influential
releases as DBX.

Bell was influenced primarily by Chicago House as well as the works of Steve
Reich and Philip Glass. His productions are characterized by minimalist
house grooves accented by blips and bleeps. Some tracks also feature bizarre
voice effects and eerie atmospherics such as "Losing Control," which caused
a sensation when released in 1994.

In the mid to late 90's Bell moved behind the scenes to create 7th City
Distribution which exclusively pressed and distributed Robert Hood's
M-plant, Dopplereffekt's Dataphysix and Anthony Shakir's Frictional record
labels, to name a few. He also launched Elevate, Harmonie Park and
relaunched 7th City Records. Debut releases on these labels helped kick
start the music careers of Todd Sines, Rick Wade, Theo Parrish and Shawn
Rudiman among others.

In 2000, he relocated to Berlin, Germany, and released his first dj mix CD,
"The Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell," on Tresor Records to wide critical
acclaim. 2003 brought a follow-up release on Logistic records, "The
Button-Down Mind Strikes Back," and soon after a retrospective cd of older
work was released: "Blip, Blurp, Bleep: The Music of Daniel Bell".

For the past few years Daniel has kept a heavy dj schedule that has brought
him all over the world. In 2007, he took a step back from djing to focus on
production and developing a live show that he's finally taking to the road.

Live in Tel Aviv 06

In creating an enviroment for this event to truly deliver all the potential
that techno can bring to the table we will be enlisting the help of some of
the best sound engineers in the buisness bringing a semi of no hards bar
chest compressing sound stage. No expense will be spared.

Coming to help us beat these speakers like their built to be beaten will be
some of the family who have been dying to push air like this for a long
time.

Subject: {pb-cle} 2008 NYE PARTY | Chinatown Inn | 12.31.07 - Thumptek

December 31st, 2007

For seven years, Pittsburghers and many others from across multiple states
have made this party their destination on New Year's Eve. Why? It's like
no other party around.

Take the freshest cutting-edge techno, house and breaks DJs, spread them
across two floors, add one of the best sound systems heard in Pittsburgh
and throw in a packed house that's ready to get down. That's the formula
that's been used since the beginning, and once you see it in action you
will quickly realize why this is one of Pittsburgh's most legendary
parties year after year.

Welcome the advent of 2008 with open arms, open ears, and friendly peers.

Third Floor
Thumptek Live PA
Inspired by the energy of Pittsburghs late 90s underground dance scene
(House of Styles, 5 Star, Downlow events), Jason Evanko has built his
style and studio to produce not only individual tracks, but continuous
dance floor pounding 100% live techno performances under the name
Thumptek. These mostly improvised hardware live sets are best described as
a raw blend of jackin minimal techno, and gritty acidhouse. Throughout
the millennium, Jason has been a key player of Pittsburghs Electronic
Dance Music scene, not only as a live techno performer/producer, but also
as a promoter.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from crAkron, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far
east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm now including some
Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well as some somewhat
related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto since pittsburgh
and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

i have removed the weeklies from the mailer, but they are still listed 
on the web site. 

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 4 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.

Mon Dec 31                    CHINATOWN INN NYE                  Pittsburgh

December 31st, 2007

For seven years, Pittsburghers and many others from across multiple 
states have made this party their destination on New Year's Eve. Why? 
It's like no other party around.

Take the freshest cutting-edge techno, house and breaks DJs, spread them
across two floors, add one of the best sound systems heard in Pittsburgh
and throw in a packed house that's ready to get down. That's the formula
that's been used since the beginning, and once you see it in action you
will quickly realize why this is one of Pittsburgh's most legendary
parties year after year.

Welcome the advent of 2008 with open arms, open ears, and friendly 
peers.

Third Floor
Thumptek Live PA
Inspired by the energy of Pittsburgh.s late 90.s underground dance scene 
(House of Styles, 5 Star, Downlow events), Jason Evanko has built his 
style and studio to produce not only individual tracks, but continuous 
dance floor pounding 100% live techno performances under the name 
Thumptek. These mostly improvised hardware live sets are best described 
as a raw blend of jackin. minimal techno, and gritty acidhouse. 
Throughout the millennium, Jason has been a key player of Pittsburgh.s 
Electronic Dance Music scene, not only as a live techno 
performer/producer, but also as a promoter.

scene rocking?

Plus, this year we have made it our personal mission to put our efforts 
from all of our events to a cause higher than ourselves. A portion of

Friday Jan 11th

$12 pre-sale
$20 @ door

Location Secret Virgin Space [Akron area: Directions will be posted 
online the week of and on the info line]

It's time to play it for keeps boys and girls. We have one of our most 
honered guests to date coming to pay N.E. Ohio for the first time in 
almost a decade. Once part of Cybersonik alongside Richie Hawtin and 
John Acquaviva we bring you

<img src="http://www.beyondbooking.com/artists/daniel_bell/daniel_bell_190.jpg">

Daniel Bell [DBX]
Daniel Bell is considered to be one of the pioneers of the minimal 
techno genre. Born in Sacramento, California, Bell grew up outside of 
Toronto, and later moved to Detroit where he collaborated with Richie 
Hawtin as Cybersonik for three years on Plus 8 records. In 1991, he 
started his own label, Accelerate, where he released a string of 
extremely influential releases as DBX.

Bell was influenced primarily by Chicago House as well as the works of 
Steve Reich and Philip Glass. His productions are characterized by 
minimalist house grooves accented by blips and bleeps. Some tracks also 
feature bizarre voice effects and eerie atmospherics such as "Losing 
Control," which caused a sensation when released in 1994.

In the mid to late 90's Bell moved behind the scenes to create 7th City 
Distribution which exclusively pressed and distributed Robert Hood's 
M-plant, Dopplereffekt's Dataphysix and Anthony Shakir's Frictional 
record labels, to name a few. He also launched Elevate, Harmonie Park 
and relaunched 7th City Records. Debut releases on these labels helped 
kick start the music careers of Todd Sines, Rick Wade, Theo Parrish and 
Shawn Rudiman among others.

In 2000, he relocated to Berlin, Germany, and released his first dj mix 
CD, "The Button-Down Mind of Daniel Bell," on Tresor Records to wide 
critical acclaim. 2003 brought a follow-up release on Logistic records, 
"The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back," and soon after a retrospective cd 
of older work was released: "Blip, Blurp, Bleep: The Music of Daniel 
Bell".

For the past few years Daniel has kept a heavy dj schedule that has 
brought him all over the world. In 2007, he took a step back from djing 
to focus on production and developing a live show that he's finally 
taking to the road.

Live in Tel Aviv 06
http://www.beyondbooking.com/artists/daniel_bell/Daniel_Bell_-_Tel_Aviv.mp3

In creating an enviroment for this event to truly deliver all the 
potential that techno can bring to the table we will be enlisting the 
help of some of the best sound engineers in the buisness bringing a semi 
of no hards bar chest compressing sound stage. No expense will be 
spared.

Coming to help us beat these speakers like their built to be beaten will 
be some of the family who have been dying to push air like this for a 
long time.

Candyball: Ravers In The Caribbean, is now scheduled for Friday April 
18th, 2008! The club is booked, 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and a DJ that spun last year is taking the last spot on the main room 
lineup as the local DJ I received the most requests to bring back! We 
are going to do the main room DJ booth up like a Pirate Ship and do some 
Caribbean themed decorations throughout the rest of the club. Last but 
not least, my sideroom is locked up as well and in fact, is already 
leaking out. Thank you for the 1:30am text buddy, I know it was a great 
choice to book her, that's why I did! ;) j/k lol but not really, I 
really got a text at 1am last night about a DJ I booked yesterday 
afternoon for next April. How do you people find out so fast???

The club is booked, 3 out of the 4 headliners are booked for the main 
room, 3 of the RO Residents are scheduled to appear in the main room, 
and I filled the last spot in the main room once again with a DJ who 
spun last year that I have gotten a ton of emails to rebook! We will of 
course be running with the whole 4th of July/American Independance theme 
throughout the club with a multitude of red, white, and blue glowsticks 
being thrown out ALL NIGHT LONG!!! At the moment, it will probably 
change by the end of the day, I am only two time slots away from having 
the side room locked up for July. So yea, I am now REALLY excited.

party itself was such a critical and emotional success we decided to 
seize the left over feelings in the air and mark that date for a future 
reunion party. Hulla will forever be officially .over. but it was really 
nice to revisit it, as well as welcome a whole new generation of Hulla 
Ravers into the fold and we look forward to doing it one more time.

The other thing is that Hullabaloo has turned into a global party, 
attracting patrons from all over the world, so it seemed prudent to let 
people start making their plans now since there could be significant 
investment by some in getting here.

More details about the party and weekend won.t be made until early 2008, 
but after talking to many patrons about their need to plan ahead I.ve 
come up with an optional way to hold a ticket for the next event.



Announcing the Hulla Friend Membership.

- $25 discount off our 2008 reunion event tickets! (So ultimately you 
pay nothing)
- Tickets for Hulla Friends go on sale ONE WEEK before regular 
availability (no mayhem on ticket day)
- 20% discount code for all Hullabaloo box sets from the HullaStore (not 
including OMGH or DVD).
- Special mailing list that will keep you updated on all Hulla event 
news
- You will get sent a link to the new flyer 24 hours before it goes 
public (expected Feburary 2008).

The price is $25, which as noted is deducted from your ticket purchase 
when they go on sale.


There.s also some more free bonuses:

If you buy your Hulla Friend Membership with the OMGH and/or Hulla DVD 
you get 2 FREE BONUS CDs (a $30 value!):

Anabolic Frolic live @ Hullabaloo Accelerator - This was a test run for 
a "Happy2bHardcore LIVE" project that never saw release. A complete 
pro-tools live audience recording putting you right into the party. This 
set was also notable since it contained the Frolics' baby announcement!

Anabolic Frolic @ MC Storm live @ Hullabaloo WEMF Stage 2002. The last 
ever Hulla stage at WEMF went down in history with Frolic & Storm 
together again, and the famous marriage proposal at the end of the set!

Both these CDs are out of print and this is your only way to get them. 
They're yours free (a $30 value!) for anyone adding a Hulla Friend 
Membership to their OMGH box set and/or DVD order.


Only a limited number of Hulla Friend Memberships will be sold and this 
offer can be rescinded at any time. It's not our intention to sell-out 
next year's Hullabaloo reunion before tickets even go on sale so we will 
cut these off at any time. But for those of you that get in before 
they're gone you're getting a great value and you can mark next year's 
date off the calendar knowing you've got a head start on tickets. We.ll 
also be using a new ticketing system for next year.s event which won.t 
falter under the volume of orders, so we expect tickets to sell out even 
faster (in hours, or even minutes?), so this will give you some 
breathing room.

Hulla Friend Memberships go on sale tomorrow (August 2nd) at the 
HullaStore, along with pre-orders of the OMGH box set of recordings and 
Hulla DVDs
