AH! an interesting point has been noted, kinda... It seems that Uranus
is geared towards the House/Techno front, and that Bassrush is geared
to the Jungle front.  Makes the decision of which to go to much
easier.  Also, its not really like a competition, because they are
going to be two COMPLETELY different parties! :) They'll both probably
kick A LOT of ass! :D  so, the choice is not which will be better, but
which will be more one's own style :) have fun no matter where you are
that night kids! and BE SAFE! :) love, Count Zer0

happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can

family and friends, and when you forward the message to the collection 
address if you're the 50th, 100th, 150th, etc signee. i figure if theres 
one gathering of folks that loves sesame street its ravers.

Subject: Save Sesame Street from being cancelled

This is a petition to save Sesame Street. ALL YOU DO IS ADD YOUR NAME
TO THE LIST AT THE BOTTOM, then forward it to everyone you know. The
only time you send it to the included address is if you are the 50th,
100th, etc. The address is:   kubi7975@blue.univnorthco.edu             
Send it on to everyone you know.

PBS, NPR (National Public Radio), and the arts are facing major
cutbacks in funding. In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce
spending costs and streamline their services, the government officials
believe that the funding currently going to these programs is too
large a portion of funding for something which is seen as
"unworthwhile." Currently, taxes from the general public for PBS equal
$1.12 per person per year, and the National Endowment for the Arts
equals $.64 a year in total. A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll
indicated that 76% of Americans wish to keep funding for PBS, third
only to national defense and law enforcement as the most valuable
programs for federal funding.

 Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations commitees each have
13 subcommitees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies.
Each subcommitee passes its own appropriation bill. The goal each
year is to have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year,
which is October 1. In the instance of the Corporation of Public
Broadcasting, the bill determines the funding for the next three
years.

 When this issue comes up in 1996, the funding will be determined for
fiscal years 1996-1998.

The only way that our representatives can be aware of the base of
support or PBS and funding for these types of programs is by making
our voices heard.

Please add your name to this list if you believe in what we stand
for. This list will be forwarded to the President of the United
States, the Vice President of the United States, the House of
Representatives and Congress.

 If you happen to be the 50th, 100th, 150th, etc. signer of this
petition, please forward to: kubi7975@blue.univnorthco.edu.
 This way we can keep track of the lists and organize them. Forward
this to everyone you know, and help us to keep these programs alive.

 Thank you.

The music is where it is at.  Give Richie a break.  It takes a lot of effort to
put out his music and we should respect him for that.  Plus don't you think it
is alot to ask someone to travel 5 days stright just to DJ for and hour???

im definately going to formation, i just hope it wasnt like Bassrush 4..in
that there werent any windows and the rooms were like too hot to even just
listen to the phat lineup they delivered..

i hope the bassrush crew learns from previous problems because they always
deliver good music, just want to be able to dance to it without dying...

just an observation

Peoples,

Please, save some bandwidth, time, and energy -- don't forward it on.

i don't know if you guys got it or not, but last week, the mtn-raves list got
a message from the the author of the original "save sesame street" petition.
 he is grateful to all those who supported the petition, but wants us to stop
circulating it.  you see, congress voted on the issue a long time ago--sesame
street already has been saved.  yay.

Ok, in the great tradion of pb-cle-raves, I am here to kindly ask if
anybody has space for one more who is going to Bassrush Formation next
week, coz I'd really really really like to go with sugar and candy and
stuff on top.  
    If you are so kind as to allow me to come along, I'd of course pay fer
gas, bring some candy, and mixtapes (happy hardcore, jungle, acid,
whatever).  And to make you feel extra good, I go for the people, the
vibe, and most of all the (*jungle*) MUSIC, and not for drugs, so you
won't have to worry about dealing with some messed up person you don't
know very well.
   If you can help me out, email me back or give me a call at 648-4675.  
Thanks lots,

i'd like to apologize for the spam on my part. usually i'm on the ball 
about chain mail that should be deleted and not forwarded. this is the 
first message of that sort that i've ever forwarded, much less 
crossposted to multiple lists. thanks to the folks that politely and 
nicely "flamed" <guess its not a flame in that case, anyway.> me in reply, 
informing me of the situation. ravers rock. again, my apologies. 
 
we need a worldwide <non-regional> rave list. :)

well if your internet provider gives you newsgroups...
try alt.rave.
it takes a little work to divide the wheat from the chaff, but it's
still a decent group...

well... sorry to hear about your cold... i somehow got rid of mine yesterday (which is timed nicely for te event :)

i just wanted to try to convince everyone to come to this party! it is at
the irish centre. now i know what some of you are saying--"the irish
centre... been there... done that!" or something similar. but it is one
of the only places i can go to raves because i am young and my parents
don't let me go to any that are "in bad neighborhoods" or "far away"
which sucks, because that basically means (with few exceptions) wait
until the next party at the irish centre.

so anyways.. come to thsi event! you know it will be fun... dieselboy is
gonna be there! and i dont know who o'keef is, but if his name is listed
above dieselbo, he's got to be good (or so my reasoning tells me).. and 
everyone who went to get busy knows tim is the man :)

allright.. that's it - i know my post sucks but considering a lot of the
other things that are sent to the list it just aint that bad.

--frankie g ;)

ps -- net meet @ 12:00 and 1:00 for those of you who forgot.
pps - in case you have been wondering who i am... i've got long  hair and
i'll be wearing a whistle (and thats it ;)

no shit...but what do you expect from wizard workshop...10,000 watts isnt
all that much...he really cool and i would recommend him for throwing
parties..hes done vision of rhythm (half of it)...mi gnutts...i forget his
name at the moment but he's goodto work with, but for BIG spaces with LOTSO
people.... if they actually charged me to get in maybe they could have
afforded better sound:)

Alright y'all, I may be planning on going down south to Formation as
presented by the Bassrush crew.  I wasn't planning on it, seeing as how I
was at the last bassrush with SS and Warren G, so I thought I'd be o.k. to
miss this one, but now all you bastards have been hyping up the show and
I've been listening to my SS mixtape, and I think I've convinced myself to
go, now.  Fuck it that I have no money.  Who needs money ... not me
obviously 'cause I have none :-). 

Anyways, If anyone wants a ride I'm probably going to Baltimore for 
Formation and I can fit four other people in my truck.  So ... send me 
some mail and I'll see if we can get this thing organized.  Anyone got 
tickets?  I think I'll check with Slacker and make sure they still have 
some...

later,
Toby

heheh..since i am in a posting mood...and you all havent seen a party
review frm me in a while i can assure you :)  either hit ctrl-D or strap on
your safety belt.

friday night: preparty at simple's loft. that party rocked. the space was
really good, central downtown location, accessible by el, and there was a
really diverse group of people there. half of htem were art school students
and half were a buncha party kids. everyone got along and the place was
packeD~!
some kid spun hip hop for a really long time, and then markd spun and
played some booty house. i wouldnt have been dancin if i had known what the
lyrics in those songs were saying, but hey i was lil tipsy and it was ma
brotha mark!! so i had to dance ;) hehe...david siska went on after mark
and played my favorite record so he gets props. after dave was gill, and
well, i am a bit biased, but i love the kinda chill shit that gill plays,
so i was all cozy.

basically i really enjoyed this party b/c it was really small, and
homegrown, and it was the place that i got to surprise all of my friends
with my entrance to chicago for the weekend :) i was really glad to get to
hang out with people on friday night since i knew that blastoff was goign
to be really hectic and loud.  after the party ended, we all went back to
gills house and smooshed into bed and crashed hard...

the next day we woke up really late and just chilled, played records, ate
spaghetti, and vraved, preparing for BLaSToFF...

----------------

BLaSToFF

lets see, quick breakdown.

we knew that the party was going to be FUCKIng CrowdED so we left super
early and got there in time to wait in line for about 15 minutes, tops.
that was pretty cool. security didnt even check my bag, even when they said
no containers. so that was rad since i had brought two waterbottles to fill
inside.

the space was at the chicago expo center, right next to photon. i have been
to photon but never to the expo center. surprisingly it was really nice. i
thought that the people at the door were being really efficinet when we
were getting in, but obviously they had somet trouble later since everyone
else had to wait in line for 1-3 hours.

the lights:
too many lights. i dont like a lot of visuals, although i will have to say
that that big screen with all the funky projections was really really cool.
but overall, the lights were all blinking in my face and it made the whole
thing seem kinda hectic. i didnt like that part, but whatever.

the sound:
pretty much sucked. it was WAY TOO LOUD. i usually like to be right up in
front by the speakers/tables, and it was so loud, i just could not stay up
there for very long. not only that, but the bass was just all over the
place and didnt even sound clear or good. like someone mentioned before, it
was very muddled. it was hte worst during derrick carters set. it disturbed
many of us greatly.

the music:
DIZ-i got there during the middle of diz's set. the last time i heard diz
was at a lil basement club in cleveland called the brillo pad and he
fucking blew me away. he was good here too,but not as good as i remembered
him being in cleveland, i think it had a lot to do with the sound tho, i
jsut hate diversified audio. they have a way of wrecking everything so it
sounds like shit. sorry to be so negative about that, but hey i am
misscranky today. overally, i love the kind of house that diz spins, so i
was glad to start off hte party with something so chill, b/c for hte next
four or so hours the shit really kicked hard.

robert armani-ahh he was alright, it was the first tiem that i heard him, i
was up by the tables watching, and he didnt really impress me that much,
especially when he played discos revenge. whatever. but he did play that
jazz it up record which i like, so i guess its ok =P

claude young: this man is awesome. he is so much fun to watch. he is jsut
so quick and does everything like a fiend. i saw him at the brillo pad in
cleveland too, and ppl in cleveland were just NOT ready for him. they were
saying "waht the fuck? this guy sucks" i think they just didnt get it. but
in chicago, it was all good! watching him fuck shit up and mess with
everythign just puts a smile on my face, even if it is hard to dance to!

i might be missing something, b/c the whole middle part of this party is
kinda fuzzy for me...

joey beltram next maybe? surprisingly i liked what he spun. last time i saw
him i wasnt too impressed either, but this time he got me dancing for a lil
bit.

i think dj hell was next, i dont have a lot to comment about him, i think i
was mainly walking around and meeting ppl and seeing my old friends frm
chicago during this part. likewise, i know i missed alot of the surgeons
set, but i remember thinking that he was really good...so wahtever. i know
this review sounds all schizo and i apologize, its late and i am wired and
not making much sense. after the surgeon was mike dearborn, and again i
dont have that much to comment about him. i think i was still walkin around
or something.

just to interject right here, this is the time that i got an overall
feeling fore this party. there wwere SO MANY people there it was
ridiculous. at times, there were just huge conglomerations of people jsut
standing asround. it was crazy. i was talking to some of the texas netters
who came up (merrick and triet) adn they were telling me that in texas
there arent nearly as many ppl at a party, but everyone dances. i wihs
everyone would dance in chicago. yeah right like that will ever happen. the
stairs were so crowded i thought i was going to fall down them with
eveyrone pushing to get up . the guy out in the lobby screaming at eveyrone
to go into the main area was a complete asshole esp when he yelled at me
and nancy for going into the mens room. at that point there was literally
no room for all of those ppl who were in teh lobby to go into hte main
room!! it was nuts to even expect that of us. they were screaming at ppl to
put out their cigarettes. i am not sure why since earliuer, they werent
doing that. markd put his out on my hand, unfortunately.

generally during these three hours everything was really crazy and there
were just mad people *everywhere*...nuts. i was happy to see that the
bathrooms werent full of tweakers like they usually are...mainly it was ppl
just chillin in there sitting down. usually there are a buncha fucked up
lil kids getting more messed up in there. although eveyrone that i talked
to mentioned a high drug factor, i only had ppl ask me ifi wanted drugs
twice. that is weird for chicago, usually everyone and their mother is
offering me anything they can get a buck (or 20) for. but if you stood near
the stairs long enough you might get smothered by the flyer-ers or the
dealers. you had your pick....anyways...


as i came out of my cloud, the best thing that could have happened
happened. stacey pullan came on and kicked it with some drum and bass for
my jungle soul. awwwwwwww yeah...i couldnt have been happier. after being
very distracted for three hours, i finally got to chill and just dance my
_B () () T a Y_ off. [thats for you mint ;] i couldnt have asked for
anything more lovely than to hear that beautiful music, it was really a
great plateau for the party. it was at this time that hte expo center
started emptying a little bit and everyone who hates jungle took a hike or
a bathroom break. it was perfect, i had enough room to dance, and it was
finally coolign off a little bit. so i just found my zone.
mmmmmmmmmmmdrum'n'bass

after stacey pullan i think derrick carter spun, and of course like i said
before hte SOUnd totally sucked at the beginning, i dont know what
happened. at this time a lot of people had left, the lighting had chilled
out and it was getting lighter inside, and i went in the back and hung out
iwth a buncha friends. merrick tore himself away frm the tables and came
over and hung out with me in the back, and i made him circle dance with me.
=) basically at this tiem, the party was comign to a close, and i got to
dance my butt off to some house. thanks to nancy, merrick, liz, lindsay,
tilo, and marc for humoring me and dancing with me ;) "don't stop!"

after derrick carter, the lights came on, and they had a cop car INSIDE the
expo center trying to scare ppl out side. it wasnt even light out yet!! i
felt really ripped off that the party ended so early (6am!!) its just not
right for a party to end when it is dark out still! but oh well...everyone
cleared out really quick b/c of that and b/c there were a buncha of scent
dogs outside in the parking lot. whatever. that was so unneccesary. we all
drove home and crashed.


to me, blast off was really great. granted it was in chicago, i still had a
great time at this party!  since i moved to cleveland, i barely ever get to
see anyone that i used to see all the tiem, adn it was good to come back to
chicaog and see so many ppl that iknow!! everyone and their mother was at
that party. i was talkign to markd about it today and it really is sad that
it takes sucha huge party to get everyone out there. smaller parties are
where it is at. even so, i was just grateful to come back and see so many
familiar peeps and get to see the looks on ppl's faces when they saw me :)
i was even happier to be surprised by several ppl who i had no idea were
goign to be there! (liz!!!)

basically, the reason that this party was so great for me was all of the
things that josh mentioned earlier:

>the only thing i need to know is:
>        i love the music.
>        i love to dance.
>        i love my friends.

>so i rave...

the music, the dance, and the friends is what made this party what is was
for me. for that tiem, at that moment, that is all i needed.

much love to all my friends who i got to visit with and party with this
weekend. most especially markeD, marc, scott, nance, liz, the texas
netraver posse (merrick, triet, diana, and minto), and of course, mY giLL.
sorry if i forgot anyone, but you all know who you are.

***disclaimer
i know this post is long and mushy, but i just had a fucking excellent
weekend and i am feeling emotional today.

***now back to her regularly scheduled bitchiness

	every week on 89.3 in cleveland there is a show from 9pm-11pm on
tuesday nights put on by dj lou that is really worth checking out. i listen
to it sporadically every week as i deliver my pizzas ;) he usually plays
everything from dubby/jungle/techno/trancey stuff to weird stuff and acid
jazz..pretty much everything. he never plays anything cheesy either so that
is cool...

so anyways check it out b/c i think he does a really nice job.

today the last song he played was daft punk's "musique" it was the first
time that i heard it and i was so happy--i even drove around the block so i
wouldnt have to sit in my driveway until the song was over! well anyways,
lou has a good show. tune in.

woops, didnt get this revision to the mw-calendar in time, so here it
is...the price went up to $7 because of the high probability of a really
cool grungy old-school space! (if anyone cares) 

and since no one told me about the net party in KY until waaay after this 
was announced, i hope both events can be net-friendly gatherings.  

hope to see some of you here...

another late revision...sorry!!  

three live performances (titonton's will even feature a string quartet if 
anyone's interested!) followed by DJ sets and special guest DJ, our good 
friend dave cooper from toronto rippin it up, yo.

if anyone remembers my lengthy post about the last concert event, (B)
BORON, well this is the latest event.  i've followed several suggestions,
such as raising the price a little (to a whopping $5) and making it more
of a "party," so now's your chance to show up and check out something
really phat AND different. 

plus, it's the 5-year anniversary of BODY RELEASE...and if anyone remembers 
_them_ you get the official raver chestnut award...(no stevie you dont 
count! ;)

Does anyone ever listen to Jeff's show on Case's station, 91.1 FM, from
3-5 in the afternoon?  I highly recommend it.  It's great stuff, in my
opinion.  Lots and lots of high quality acid (trance/techno/Detroit) mixed
in with a few other styles too.  Not a bad DJ either.

doh somebody punch me for forgetting this but ele_mental is presenting a 
small release party for the trace elements ep tonight sunday night in 
columbus, at mekka.

for those who dont know, the 21-22 corp (a parallel idea to ele_mental) 
just released a 4-track vinyl compilation 12" called "trace elements" which 
will be the first of such releases.  the first one features music by todd 
sines, charles noel, titonton, and m/c/jones.  all four artists will be 
spinning in the velvet room, with doughboy and midi slut kickin it in the 
main room as always (and they have been getting harder and better lately 
so come check it out).

admission is $5 and we will be giving out our last few copies of trace 
elements as well as copies of charles' fuzzy logic?! jungle ep (on grey 
vinyl!) from last year.  a little for everyone.

our little event will go from about 10.30 PM - 2.30 AM so be there!

and thanks to everyone in the know look for more vinyl to come from us
very, very soon.

greetings everyone...


	I would like to contact promoters who are currently throwing events.  If you are 
someone, or you know of someone, who is willing and able to bring in an unheard of LIVE 
PA to a future party, then please reply with a current mailing address and direct fon #.

	In return for your contact information, I will mail my current demo tape and 
press kit -- in hopes of booking my LIVE PA.

cheers.
JOY

Originating from Youngstown, a place neither Pittsburgh or Cleveland!  I 
consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and Dayton and as far 
east as Allentown.  Maybe more!

!! Well its that time of year where everyone goes back to skool and 
!! everything changes.  please look over the weeklies, radio shows, and
!! info lines.  i started adding web pages at the bottom, and have put a
!! few email addys with the infolines, any additions or corrections would
!! be appreciated.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm 
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO* 
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated as i hear of events (get flyers or email) and can 
be found at http://cc.ysu.edu/~s0176326/rom.html

of December 5 - 7 is Oberlin's Aids Awareness Weekend...the Aids quilt
will be making it's first stop ever in Oberlin the next day, Saturday

of Aids and has not yet been added to the quilt and you would like them
to be, please email me at spd7312@oberlin.edu and hopefully a square will
be able to be made in time for the showing at Oberlin. You can also email

    Would people be interested in going to a party that consisted
primarily of live acts?  Being a PA myself, I'm always frustrated by the
lack of outlets... 

    So!

    Give me your comments/suggestions, and if there are any PA's out
there that are also interested, drop me a line at emu@andrew.cmu.edu.

Pittsburgh but in January. I talked to Kiristen about this and she said
the party will be even better now that the date has changed.

yes, i really hate the fact that everyone overlooks the ppl really making
the noise, not just reproducing it.  djs have their place, but most ppl dont
seem to realize it.
i love the events the ele-guys have in cowtown with the live acts, and i'm
glad they're still doing them, yay!  laters, trouty.
p.s. yeah i'd go if i dont work.

Actually, that is a very good suggestion.  In a way, I'd much rather go to
an event with primarily live-acts.  And it doesn't even have to be big or
established acts - at some point you have to give new people and sounds a
chance.  While djing is in some ways an art, producing is that moreso
- and the creator is right there, so I think there is more energy in the
music.  Just look at any of 187's PA's -> way more energy than other
merely dj'd sets. :)

Here's a suggestion that might make an all "live-PA" event happen:
Put together a party with local techno/jungle/etc. live acts and also get
a couple of the local techno-industrial groups (Mace, Venus in Furs, etc.)
to perform.  I know Mace has a big following of people who'll go to
any show and would be fairly open minded to 'techno' musics, so it might
pick up any lack of people who wouldn't show up because it's not 'top-djs'
or whatever doing their stuff.  And it could be promoted as a showcase of
local electronic music producing talent...

I'm not sure how to go about this, but I wouldn't mind helping someone
who'd like to take off with the idea.

There are plenty of live hip-hop acts around Pittsburgh as well who do 
the equivalent of "Live PAs" that would go well with Jungle sets.  Not 
sure how the industrial thang would fit in, but my vote would be for all 
live sampler/sequencer acts to perform if the party was intended to be a 
"showcase".  Besides strictly PA acts, what about DJ's who have MCs that 
regularly work with them.  I'm not talking about someone who has a 
microphone and decides to "hype the crowd".  There are some acts around 
who have DJs in the old school sense of the word.  A DJ who cuts the 
records for someone to rhyme over.  I think it would be a nice change 
considering the way MCs and DJs typically work together at raves on a 
random and ad hoc basis.

Acts, People who would like to become involved and help me get this place 
together and all of the other stuff that goes along. I wish to have this 
place open in mid-january. Not sure exactly of the music format, but I 
wish to have a club that is not afraid to experiment. Money is not my 
motivation, but a place where people can go and live the underground. I 
am open to anything. Suggestions, comments, and all the people above

I think this is a good idea too, and it has been done before too some
success (the Final Comedown).  Sometimes it seems the main problem for
hip-hop (well, really all events) events in this city is the venue, but i
suppose that's entirely circumstancial.  
	While I'm not SURE if hip-hop to jungle to techno to industrial
live acts would work, It'd sure be cool to see.  And I might add there are
numerous "industrial" acts out there with a definate hip-hop flava' and
rap-style lyrics, though I don't think many could freestyle....In a way I
think acid or trance is farther from hip-hop and most industrial.

Definatly - jungle MC's just tend to be a little-too chit-chatty, which
gets tired after a while, but I could listen to freestyle, even if it's
not THAT good, for a much longer time, as long as the beats are fresh.

just 2 more cents fo' the pot....

 While I agree that producing is generally more interesting to me than
DJing (though I do the latter, but not the former) I'd much rather see DJs
than producers. First of all, I think techno/house/whatever is not meant
to be live music. For me, what I like about it is that you don't need to
play it physically when making it, so it has the potential to be
completely mental. This also means that you will often do things which
can't be reproduced live, whether it involves changing settings quickly,
or playing many parts or sounds simultaneously. I once saw a live PA that
was just a guy sitting cross-legged in front of his computer, with it
controlling all of his equipment. He didn't really move much, just clicked
on the computer and typed stuff in. The music was cool, and he did do it
differently from on the records, but there was really no reason to pay him
to sit there and do that.
 Secondly I think most techno, at least the stuff I mostly like (minimal)
is not meant to be played by itself. Some of my favorite records are just
a single measure loop (Lofthouse). While the tracks are cool themselves, I
don't find them especially interesting to listen or dance to until they're
mixed. Many people tell me they don't like techno because it's the same
thing over and over again, I then explain to them what a DJ does and play
them a mix tape and they usually like it a lot better. I think for most
dance music the DJ is a neccessary step between the creation of the music
and its presentation to an audience.

i guess it just depends on how you look at the music.  it can be layered 
up any way you want it i suppose.  trouty.

i can understand why you wanto see dj's more than producers....I am the
exact opposite
because we have a different ART medium...with differt skillz to be
learned..different equipment to be bought, but its all about the same thing
when it comes to playing at a party.
Some people can do both sides like Dmitry...the producing and the mixing
(yeah i know hes cocky, but i respect his Art)
i mean please respect that some people have their shit together and know
how to make their tracks AND perform them many times with as much zest as
they had while producing it...one can be a master of ceremony without the
all bullshit of spinning other peoples creations...dj's are mc's as well as
live dance musicians are mc's.

There is a common goal here: to make people dance and give people
ambience..thats all a fucking rave is anyway...pure ambience..its about
atmosphere, but theres an art to it and not just one way of getting
there...
(i reccomend reading some Brian Eno btw)

>First of all, I think techno/house/whatever is not meant
>to be live music.

what OTHER kind of music can you think of? DEAD music?
dont get lost into the genres either man..

assume that live music implies there is an ACT; something visual...
DRAMA....people doing shit to the music!  give me one reason you cant do
this LIVE to synthesizer?? if you get tired of scratching records and
playing with the crossfader; you should try playing with modulation wheels
that affect cuttoff frequencies of filters and resonance and all that shit.
thats how they recorded that record you bought!  dont bust on it if you
cant do it. some live pas are a little boring on the visual side like the
guy you were talking about....but if you like the way its sounded and it
gave you ambience and if it gave your menal justice, he is giving you
service!  tell me you havent seen a boring dj who hasnt just spun records
track after track just watching the record spin around in awe, but still
gave you good music to listen to and feel. some people have their material
down and its more of a job than an art.. what would a dj be useful for if
he didnt do shit live!??
        sorry i thought raves were art events too (thats why i go to them)
everyone has a different art man. some people dance. some people design.
some people promote. some people spin. some people make techno. some people
can PLAY techno too.:)

your entitled to your opinion of course....maybe youve never seen a good
live pa.
i agree some people maybe shouldnt do there stuff live if they dont have an
ACT,
on the same note though, dj's with no ACT shouldnt play out..
Playing live is like getting instant feedback..its a rush....i personally
am a performer at heart, but i cant spin worth shit. that doesnt bother me
one bit.
Im all for a PA party, i wish i had my gear (still saving up); ill be there
in a flash though!

as long as you keep the place bumpin, to me it dont matter what you use.
i have to stop...i have too many thoughts on my mind..
just remember: art and respect

maybe one of the problems here is that there aren't that many light show 
people here... in Seattle (sorry I'm going all regional) I've gone to
many a party that had djs + light show artists... they take out the
video mixer, hook it up to their computer and do a live light show with
their material... maybe what the PAs need (and djs as well) is partner
who does a light show or maybe promoters should start to book lightshow
people...
it all contributes to a more trippy atmosphere...

quite frankly rocks the house)

    Of course, if a live act just plays it song by song, with a pause in
between, it will get boring.  The way I run my show is, I prepare a
whole new set for each show, with segways and such, so the flow that a
DJ provides is not lost, but the spontaneity of creative thought is
there, in a way that a DJ can't reproduce.

   As for the guy sitting cross-legged behind his equipment, well, how
long do you spend looking at the DJ's?  Some people love watching them
(I do because I'm learning to spin) but when I'm dancing I could give a
fuck if the performer (DJ or otherwise) is spinning records or doing the
watusi on his head.  It matters not.

    This is very true.  I once went to a party (on the CMU campus, of
all places!) where the jungle/ambient room had a wall filled with video
images;  it was psychadelic color swirls and shapes being mixed with
scenes from the Transformers movie.  I was high as a kite at the time,
so I suppose it enhanced the effect, but it was really effective, none
the less.  The lights at That Thing and many of the other parties I've
been to have been too sparse... visual is very important, although it's
expensive enough just to be a PA that it's almost impossible to add a
lightshow and manage it yourself while you play.

    We need all the techies who have been noodling around in their
basements to come forth and bring us light!

Hi,

I've been lurking lately with this group, checking out a lot of mixtapes
(mainly DRC, Dj Trance, Thee-O -- West Coasters), and getting into
GOA/Psychedelic Trance.  

Are there any Goa fans in our part of the country?

By the way, I have to object to all the swearing on this list.  It really
looks juvenile.  I would like to think that ravers are a little more
educated that the rest of the country, not only with their musical tastes
but also with other things -- ie language.  I mean come on, we all have
college educations here (or are getting educated).  Let's find adjectives
that express ourselves appropriately.

Braden

The one promotion company that you can be assured will have visual 
artists at their parties is Telecorps.  I've DJ'd at a few parties with 
them and there is always a video projector with two people mixing live 
video, computer animation, and video tape.  Orgone Cinema often does 
parties in cooperation with Telecorps and in those situations you also 
have film loops and slides going with the video.  Believe me, if you want 
visuals, go to a Telecorps party...

And guess what, there happens to be a Telecorps party coming up next 
month on November2 called High Evil (Scary Halloween stuff and all 
that).  Check the ROM for more info.

That party was "The Final Come Down", brought to you by ... guess who ... 
Telecorps!  Like I said tcrps have their shit together when it comes to 
creating an artistic event!  (BTW, the psychedelic color swirls were c/o

swearing is a cultural difference, not a marker of intelligence..

well i was rather frazzled about the whole thing, he didnt get there until
1:10 and ppl were starting to get antsy and kept bugging me about it.  i
honestly didnt know when he was going to get there, but we were planning for
him to arrive no later than 12:30.  he spun a good set from what i've been
told, i was around talking to ppl at the door and watching some guy do card
tricks (he was a former card shark) instead of hanging out up front.
everyone flocked to the front as soon as word got around that he had just
got there and alot of ppl were really dancing and having a good time.  for
those that know tommy (the owner of cedars) it was really funny to see him
up front checking out the dj.  he was really confused that that many ppl
would get up and dance for a dj, rather than a band.

ditto!  i'd really like to see more events like this.
perhaps the reason that electronic artists have difficulty doing live 
sets is because most of us are never given the chance!!!

this is a very good idea!  mace would almost definitely be interested.
if anyone here has heard their new album "climax generator vs.2", you'll
see that they could do a dancey techno set.  they are even messing with 
sped up breakbeats on this album....and when they had chuck j (anybody 
know how to contact him now...he's in philly i think) as their keyboardist,
he was working on techno mixes of their stuff alot so they could play raves.
i think that a live show featuring all kinds of electronic artists would 
be a success.  everything from industrial to jungle to ambient to
hip hop.....a SMASH!

p.s.- another band to think about is revo or next level x.....

i'd like to somehow help something like this occur.

ryu

Kate..
Hey!  What's up?  Remeber me?  We met at Trilogy awhile back.  Well I am
still around here in the Cleveland-area.  I must agree that there really
is not enough going on in Cleveland.  every rave calendar has only like
one or two Cleveland parties.  Whats up with dat?  

Hey Cleveland ravers...lets wake up and party!!!!!!!
We really must get some more stuff going on here in Cleveland.  I myself
am going to try and help this situation by seeing what I can do to throw
a rave party.  This an idea I just came up with and I really think I can
make it happen!  Anyone want to help...e-mail me a reply.  I'll give
more details on the list when I have more.  OK?  Let's see if we can
wake up the Cleveland rave scene here!!!  OK???

Live music at raves can be a nice change and makes the event more
unique.  I've been talk'n to Ken (tweaker) about this for a while now. 
I usually dj and love doing it, but I'd like to do some more PA'n. 
That's one of the reasons I'm bringing Capsula 19 down from NY for
"Latino Vibe" this saturday at the CMU UC ballroom.  They play live
latin house and jungle.  Spinning is great, but making music and PA'n
gives you a chance to put more of your ideas onto the dance floor.  

Peace,
Johnny

yuppers.  that's what i've been doing lately.  too much studying.  i am
definitely looking forward to hearing terry mullen and seeing you all at the
brillo pad next thursday-  and for $3?  what a deal.  so i want to know how
it went this thursaday there.  did anyone go?  how was the crowd, music,
etc.?  i hope terry will draw a huge crowd of us enthusiasts as usual.  and
keight, you're right.  we do need more input from the cle part of pb-cle.
actually, i thought the list was mostly pb, since most of the events seem to
be in that direction and we clevelanders don't say much.  but i would have
to disagree with stevie-t and his twisted sense of priorities.  :)  maybe we
clevelanders don't play on the net as much, but is that good?  maybe we just
work too hard.     
whatever.  off to bed i go.  goodnight.

        Hey Kate, those Cleveland, Ohio people are out there, they are just
spending too much time whining on MW-Raves.jk.  Anyway, I went to Cedar's
Wednesday, yeah call us silly for driving all the way from Columbus,
knowing Terry Mullan's track record with showing up to gigs. For the
longest time everyone thought he wasn't going to show and I was content
with just visiting my friends from Warren and surrounding parts. Like Trout
Soup said, he got there around 1:15Am with Sleepy-C, but his set was far
from desirable and well Terry-like. He let two records play out for Christ
sake's!  Maybe he was tired but I'm not making excuses from him. Then he
plays a jungle record at the end to further confuse me.  To top off the
night, somebody took a cigarette to my new expensive pants and left a nice
fuckin' hole near the crack! Thank you asshole wherever you are! One reason
I try not to get caught up too much into fashion- I always pay for it in
the end. ha (pause) h..(too pissed to laugh)
        You have a better chance of catching an actual Terry Mullan set
next week at the Brillo Pad since Steve and him are good pals. Thanks go
out to the Formula crew for getting him though. These guys have delivered
on 3 big dj's and more people should come out. Check the ROM for the next
big event.

Later,

good idea--*my most adorable smile*--i will also offer sexual favors 
(!) in addition to gas $, food, stickers, candy, caffeine, other
suggestions are welcome, & i will bring my trip-toys & mixtapes to 
share. so if you're going let me know u are & what i should bring!

actually, this is urban myth.  this never happened.  somebody leveled the 
accusation while she made an appearance on "the Howard Stern Show," and 
it was quickly denied.  of course, the rumor spread like wildfire anyways.

                                                                 Len Flatley

The Ravers Geriatric challenge: Do you enjoy the techno life? Are many of
your friends 10 years younger than you? Did you live the life portrayed in
Dazed and Confused? Do you sometimes feel like a counselor, a teacher, an
aunt or uncle to the brave youth of the world?

If you answered yes to any of these questions and you are over the age of 25, 
you are invited to join the list serve Ravers Geriatric. (You younger
punks, go make you're own list). :) Its not our fault we found a good thing
a little later in life. Like many worthwhile things, the concept of Ravers
Geriatric grew out of a joke among a few of us here in the Northeast. Its
got a small but dedicated readership extending from New York to California.
The traffic is low, and you can talk about whatever's on your mind, though
most of its geared to rave culture.

sometime, and will be in the pittsburgh area (thus the 412 area code)

please dont take this as a diss jason, just helping ya out...:)

hello all,
   in case you don't know, MOBY will be in pittsburgh
on the 26th of this month...that's saturday!  he will not be
doing music i don't think...he is one of the performer for the
diamanda galas (go to http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/galas/.htm)
for info on diamanda galas.  the performance is being held at
the byam theater.
   i just thought i'd let anyone else here who still likes moby
know about it because i hadn't seen it advertised at all.

love,
ryu

Yeah that's excellent!  RYU: where did you hear that Moby would be in it?
I was going already, but now it'll be extra-ghouliscious!
Maybe I'll finally meet you!  

Anybody else on the list - you should go see this: it's only $10 with a
student id, and I'v heard Ms. Galas' performances are excellent.  Not
really techno, but a good thing none the less. ;p

ok, i may have made a mistake when i gave the

mistake.  i got his tour info from daniel cerman's
moby page (which is the best i ever saw too). to
go directly to the tour info, which is on mute's page,
and get linked to the diamanda page,
type:

http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/news/tour.htm#moby

incidently, daniel's page is:
http://www.hyperreal.com/music/artists/moby/

the performance will be on saturday the 26th at 
the Byam Theatre in pittsburgh, pa for a cost of 
10 bucks.  i do not know where the byam is, or
what time the show starts, but if anyone knows,
please let us know.

love,

Subject: {pb-cle} partying in dc can suck
Sender: owner-pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.com
Precedence: bulk

well last weekend was the first time i every partied in dc..well of course
it was buzz, not a real party, but the music is pretty much the same.
anyway dont take the subject of this email as a direct attack on the d.c.
scene, because my experience this weekend had nothing to with how good or
bad the vibes, music poeple or promoters are...its just one of those
stories you just have to tell...like for the love of dancing kind of
thing..
        okay my friend Amira calls me a 4:00pm on friday at penn state. (im
there too). she's like "wanna go to buzz 2nite?" im like sure..we decided
we'd leave at 8:00 (usually a four hour drive). Keep in mind this isnt her
car we are using, it belongs to our friend Katrina. before we get out of
penn state, we get gas. After we figure out we cant start the car we call
Katrina, the owner, and she comes and fixes it for us..alright no worries,
were on our way..(9:30pm)
       We made really good time considering the hard rain the entire time,
hail storms occasionally, and fog patches randomly..so we get into dc area
at 1:30am, now Amira had been to buzz a million times; me never, despite
many attempts to find rides. Anyway, she had never driven herself there so
she had no idea how toget there...we drove around the city for about an
hour and after many attempts to find the Capitol Ballroom or trax..some
taxi said hed take us there wed just have to follow him..
        thats when the car started dying!!  actually the transmission.. we
were suddenly on an interstate exit with no power to the wheels. i got out
and tried to push, but the ground was too slippery and the hill was too
steep. finally a cop came. after telling our story, he pushed us off the
exit ramp and onto a street where we could park right near the capitol. He
was really nice about everything, for a nice change; nicer than the normal
people giving us bad directions at seven 11's and gas stations. He gave us
a ride to buzz, (he wanted $50 for the taxi service, we were like ummmm NO)
        So we got there at 3:15am about...i heard like two dj's spin in the
main room; they were good..some guy 333 or something and scott henry from
4:30-6:00am..we had no idea what we were going to do about the car..
        well the story gets longer and more interesting, but it also gets
more personal and not something i want to post to random people, even
though you guyz and galz would probably understand;

AND guess what???? I had a Kickass time, (if you can believe it)!!!

oh yeah, and please dont ask how we got back or what were gonna do about
the car proabaly still sitting on the corner of 9th street and G in the
middle of Washingtom D.C., and dont ask what Amira got on her midterm
today, and dont ask what the owner of the car Kartrina thinks about this
whole thing either :P

thats how desperate we are to find somewhere to dance at penn state...man i
need a generator so bad


peace

==================================================================

here's the low down that Kirsten left me on my voice-mail...

yes, Seven Blows of the Dragon has been moved to January 18th
mostly becuz Spawntaneous decided to throw their party on the
same previous date (but as karma would have it, plastikproducts
is throwing Jak is Bak - the long awaited return of richie hawtin
to the USA on the same previous date).

yes, Seven Blows of the Dragon will be taking place in Pittsburgh
mostly becuz that is where Kirsten is currently residing at in 
addition pittsburgh definitely has a larger jungle massive than
cleveland.

the info # is 412.521.2578, it is currently info-less, but it is
Kirsten's #, if yur lucky u'll get to talk to Kirsten herself, if
u do remind her to e-mail me at syt@po.cwru.edu.

Hmm, Steph comes out of hiding.  Sorry I've been a stranger.  I'm a-movin' on
up yall, working lots of hours, moving into a new place, etc.  Whatever.

So there's been lots of talk about possibilities for shows featuring live
PAs.  It's cool that the attitudes have been gnereally really open-minded.
 Big things to remember when considering this, I think, are the endless
possibilities and combinations, and to start small.

Tea talked about the hip hop/jungle/artsy telecorps end of things, Ken
mentioned the industrial stuff, someone else (eric?) talked about the ravier
side of things.  I know all are possible cuz I've seen them done, or at least
heard about it.  I think it would be good to keep the vibe interesting but
consistent in a project like this.  Telecorps pulls it off beautifully.  If
you've been to one of their parties or plan to be at the Nov 2 gig, you know
what I mean.

As far as the techno/industrial continuum, I think our old friend, the
godfather of pedantry, Manny Theiner has tried to pull this one off a few
times.  I remmber fliers for a gig at the beehive this summer with
indie/electro/spacey/techno/industrial bands and DJs.  I think Sine was on
the bill.  Don't know how it turned out, but I wanted to go.  The risk you
run with a show like that is that you'll alienate the guitar/new age heads
with the feeling of, "What is this cotton candy rave shit?"  And that you'll
alienate the techno heads by "watering down" the music they live for.
 Obviously, these problems can be avoided with the right magic potions.  And
promotional skills, I guess. ;)

I think if you keep it simple and make sure you can kind of "connect the
dots" between the ideas you're trying to throw into one party, things could
work beautifully.  As someone pointed out, it's not hard to find crossover
between certain crowds.  but if you try to throw too much in, you'll turn
everybody off, or they'll at least sequester themselves to the musics and
people where they feel safe, and that ain't no kind of vibe.

Without getting into the complicated and obsolete argument over who's better,
djs or producers, I'll just say there's a fine line, often crossed, they're
different tools for different effects, and both have whole worlds unto
themselves.  The stuff Kool Herc did bears relatively little resemblence to
the stuff you'll see Scott Henry do, for example.  Music, objectives,
techniques, ideas, history, tools, they're just different.  Related, yes, but
really totally different animals.

That's it, sorry to harp on a week old subject.  Keep the ideas flowing.  I
__HOPE!!___ to see a number of you at Evil Night (?)....will be
sscccaaarrrrryyyy........   :)

 but also with other things -- ie language.  I mean come on, we all have
 college educations here (or are getting educated).  Let's find adjectives
 that express ourselves appropriately.
  >>

Ok, make ya a deal.  I won't get on you about your dumb-ass,
pseudo-intellectual,
just-got-out-of-high-school-and-I-still-believe-everything-mommy-and-daddy-tol
d-me ig'nant attitude, and you GET OFF OF MY FUCKING SPEECH PATTERNS, KID!!!!
 Don't _even_ tell me how to talk, or anybody else.  Don't talk to me about
manners, or being "educated", ooh aah, or how to express myself
appropriately.  What's on my mind is what I'll express and how I think it is
the appropriate way to express it, not hung with OED trappings that are
arbitrary anyway.  With that attitude, you skate damn close to prejudice.
DON'T TELL ME HOW TO THINK.  

And before you get out of your little college with your little degree, do
what I did before graduating as a Latin Americanist, a published journalist,
AND a published poet, take a goddamm class in sociolinguistics and see just
how the idea of "proper speech" has mad holes and inconsistencies.
 Hopefully, even if you continue to hold the opinion you now hold, you'll be
able to back it up with some thinking that's a little less "juvenile" and
elitist, and a bit more appropriate for an "educated raver".

i just remembered, and i don't know if something else said this, but..

ultraworld in baltimore has thrown a couple of parties with mostly DJs
but also the Almighty Senators, who are an all live funk band.  Most of
the time I think they played in separate rooms, but last time I saw them
was at Eclipse, which had only one (big) room, and they played during
the middle of the party.  My personal feeling was that they disrupted
the vibe of the party due to the style of music they played, which was
good, but just not right for the time.  However, i think a lot of people
liked it.

i think it definitely is possible to mix styles in one party, but it
takes practice to get the right formula so that you'll keep the most
people happy.

Remember, more dj's will be confirmed soon - this is only a pre-eflyer!
So join us in having a great time while raising $ to fight the killer
disease that infects one out of every 250 Americans. ALSO - the weekend
of December 5 - 7 is Oberlin's Aids Awareness Weekend...the Aids quilt
will be making it's first stop ever in Oberlin the next day, Saturday
December 7th. You may come for the party, but please try and stay for the
quilt. And if someone inyour family or someone you know has recently died
of Aids and has not yet been added to the quilt and you would like them
to be, please email me at spd7312@oberlin.edu and hopefully a square will
be able to be made in time for the showing at Oberlin. You can also email
me at spd7312@oberlin.edu for no good reason other than to say hi :) Hope
to see you there and look for final e-flyers with final lineups at the
end of this week. Thanks :)

The Byham Theater is located on 6th Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh...  
It is actually part of the Benedum Performance/Art Center.

They do not have an upcoming info line so that is all  I can provide 
for now....

I will phone them tomorrow and see what the deal is... I haven't 
heard anything about the show.

Diamanda Galas(sp?)  I have heard before,  she had an album out new 
last fall with keyboard work being done by John Paul Jones of Led 
Zepplin fame... Her album sounded most excellent when I heard several 
tracks played on WVU's radio station...

Should be interesting...   The Byham/Benedum is one of those formal 
places so dress code might be enforced...... And additionally,  I 
believe Diamanda is classically trained so the show might be somewhat 
surprising to some people...

Word ... I was waiting for someone to take this on, not wanting to do so
myself 'cause I'm nothing but a lowly computer network analyst (with poor
grammar, as far as the queen would be concerned) ... but anyways, glad to
see a journalist stand up for free speech...no matter how improper it may
appear on-line.

Alright, that's enough.  Swearing on the list and the like will be
tolerated as long as it's not directed towards a listmember.  If it
continues, I'll have no choice but to impose some new posting rules.

Just take it easy, everyone.  Think twice before you post something to the
list in anger.  The list is for discussion, not for recess time bickering.

Recently I made a comment regarding swearing on this list.  I suppose I
should clarify what I meant.

I'm not opposed to swearing per se in life.  If you've ever played tennis
or ultimate frisbee with me, you'd know that.  All I was saying is that
striving to reach a higher level seems to be an important part of the rave
culture as I see it.  Take a look at sfraves, 303 rave or "goa@party.net" 
and see how different those lists are.  Is that because people from those
places are more intelligent and have more compelling ideas than folks from
Pittsburgh and Cleveland?  I don't think so. 

What hurts me is the visciousness of the recent attacks on my character
for daring to make an observation.  If you think about it, what is so
controversial about saying that with a vocabulary of tens of thousands of
beautiful words, we might find alternatives for "shit, fuck, damned and
bitch" (and their various conjugations)?  

Why do I or have to be sworn at and called a "queen" for pointing this
out?

What are we about here anyway?  Is this rave culture or a frat party?

 
Braden

hey...i know what u mean.
but however people choose to get their point across, is fine...if
anywhere, the Net should be the ultimate place for freedom of speech...
if you don't like the profanity, then...fuck, i don't know...=)

why are swear words equated with being lowbrow?  you don't know ANYTHING
about the people behind the addresses...i know that all day in my
classes i have to speak as if i was giving a speech (okay bad choice of
words WHATEVER) so when i type out my e-mails i'm not necessarily on the
prudent tip, you dig?

i don't think anybody on this list curses THAT much, anyways...if you
know who curses enough to bother you, don't read their messages...plain
and simple...

You missed my intent .. I was referring to *The Queen*, as in the Queen's
English, you know, that level of the English language to which we're
supposed to strive.  I only meant to point out that language is a
constantly evolving beast, and the slang and vulgate that is used on this
list is a direct expression of 90's America.  Listserves have typically
been an extension of conversation and daily chit chat and banter.  Sure,
in academic circles there are listserves that may demand a more censored
text, but this is a Raves list, and most people speak to each other
off-line in the same style and content which they use in their posts. 

I certainly change my tone when addressing a peer at work, or when
composing a research paper, but when I post to PB-CLE Raves or read the
posts, I feel most comfortable addressing people in a relaxed,
converational tone.  Not to 'dis you Braden, I can respect you for wanting
to bring our discourse to a higher level if that's what you like about the
other lists to which you subscribe, but your initial post came off
sounding like an English teacher.  I'm already through Grammer School, so
now I conduct verbal exchange how *I* want to have it conducted.  If you
don't want to use the vulgate in your posts, than don't.  Simple as that,
no need to make it personal or admonish the rest of the list for their
content. 

Respect...
Toby

should start making synthesizers and MIDI gear too...of course i think
adidas should make a sampler as well...hehe.. hey, i'd buy it.

anyway:
 this article found in Post Gazette today from Associated Press:

   SPEEDY CHIP TO GIVE APPLE AN EXPONENTIAL BOOST
    San Jose, Calif. (AP)-

    A start-up company yesterday announced the speediest
microprocessor yet, a chip able to run Apple Macintosh software at up
to 533 megahertz, more than twice as fast as current chips.
    Exponential Technology, Inc. said it will offer the X-704 chip in
volume next spring.
    George Taylor, the company's founder and chief technology
officer, says the new chips will cost about $1,000 each, which would
put them into high-end computers used mostly by graphic designers and
creators of multimedia, which combines text, graphics, video and
other information into one format.
    Apple's Macs would need to be changed to take advantage of the
chip's higher speed and to accommodate the higher temperature the
chip will generate through its use of more electric power.

hi everybody!

sorry to barge in on your list, but i want to find out some info about your
scene up there.  i got a call from a company in cleveland today who may
offer me a job.

me:  i'm a Texas Raver.  one of the original 7 or 8 or so.  i'm not from tx
though.  i am a musician/dj and record/spin under the name solarvibe on my
own record label (liquid sol records.)  my first record is coming out in
about a month.  i spin primarily acid/acid house especially the cruchy
stuff. =)

what i'd like to know is:

what kind of music gets played at parties there?
how big are your parties?
do net-ravers hang out together?
what's the vibe like?

also:

avg. cost of a one bedroom apt. (or efficiency?)
is there a more artsy-oriented part of town to live in?  parts of town to
stay away from?
how are the record stores there?

geez, i guess that's a lot of questions!  anything you guys can let me know
about the fair city of cleveland would be greatly appreciated!

oh yeah!  if any of you are on vrave, send me your vrave name so i can look
for you.  it would be nice to know some people there when i arrive, if i
decide to take this job. =)

peace,

solarvibe =)

KINDER ATOM

Now with a rotating line-up of seven performers (including members of
DIGITAL POODLE and THE SUBTONIC MONKS), Kinder Atom has refined their live
show to be an interactive, visually stimulating and highly danceable event.
The group performs with two percussionists, a didjeridoo player, DJ,
dancers, and keyboards.

Founded in 1993, their debut release ATOMIKA on Los Angeles based
HYPNOTIC/CLEOPATRA RECORDS is currently being distributed internationally by
CAROLINE RECORDS and was favourably reviewed in the September '96 issue of
KEYBOARD MAGAZINE.

Kinder Atom recently supported England's RAPOON on the Canadian leg of a
North American tour, and also played a live simulcast from the Rivoli in
Toronto over radio station CKLN-FM.  As of late, KA have been holed up in
the studio completing a number of remixes including a new single by SNOW for
WARNER BROTHERS Japan.   They are also currently mastering a double digipak
CD entitled SUPER NICE HIPPY PANTS (1st Q'97) and are in negotiations with
several international video game/electronic entertainment development houses
who want to include some of KA's new & unreleased material in upcoming titles.

CD's available - ATOMIKA
TAPES available - LIVE AT THE RIVOLI (july 96 - promo only)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

LAZER CAPS

Described as KINDER ATOM's bratty little brothers, Lazer Caps is
stripped-down techno at its finest, raw, hard, and definately
uncompromising. Performing live as a trio, their minimal set-up features
portable analog equipment all performed in real-time, plugging a small
mixer's signal directly into the DJ booth, offering uninterrupted flow at
raves.  Paying homage to the intensity of the Detroit Techno sound whilst
swaying to the melodic swing of Chicago House, Lazer Caps are featured twice
with the tracks "Harmony", and "Modular Noise Funk",
on the recently issued ACID GENETIKS CD on HYPNOTIC/CLEOPATRA RECORDS.  

TAPES available - ASS KICKER (oct 96 - promo only)
                - LIVE TO AIR (oct 96 - promo only)

DIGITAL POODLE

A mainstay on the international techno-industrial circuit, DP have
released a total of seven CD's internationally, two 12"s and a 7" single!
Also, they have released a vinyl single on NINJA TUNE (the 150 BPM
hardtrance bonker "CRACK") as well as the double vinyl/CD of "DIVISION."

Digital Poodle have also released CD's with HYPERIUM/ROUGH TRADE in Germany,
as well as METROPOLIS RECORDS in Philadelphia and CLEOPATRA in Los Angeles.

Fans of DP will be pleased to note that a previously unreleased track
entitled "FunkAss" is now available on the Nekrology compilation CD,
currently being distributed through Metropolis in the States.

Their live performances are generally harsh, manic and devastatingly loud, with
a new line up of live drums, keyboards, and of course the distorted rantings
of singer MOUTH 392.

DP are currently finishing work on a new single entitled, "COMBAT." as well
as mastering a yet-untitled full length release.  

CD's available- SOUL CRUSH (1991)
		WORK TERMINAL (1992)

Hey there,

  This is the first time that I have written on here, but I have been a 
member for quite awhile.  I often find myself wondering who all the 
Cleveland ravers are myself, as I have never met any of you.  When I was 
in High School, I would hit Trilogy on Sat. and Sun., and every once in 
awhile the occasional party.  But I was with my friends from school, and 
they have all since gone away.  Now I would like to meet some of you!  I 
am going to be at Suicide this saturday, and want to meet you guys in the 
flesh.  If anyone is interested, just write back.  Hope to see you on 
Saturday!
	
	Ducky

I just noticed that the October archives weren't on the web- so I've fixed
the problem, and they'll appear tomorrow morning at the website.

This month marks the one year anniversary of having our list archived and

This is probably the first time I've been on the net in about a week. I sat
around wondering if I should even write a review. Seeing as how most people
had nothing to do but bitch, whine, and complain about this party I thought
I'd add my two bits. 1st of all the line wasn't a problem. I stood in the
line for Baby Blue for about 4 1/2 to 5 hrs. For Uranus it took me about an
hour. It was a relativley speedy entry. I got in and was glad to hear
plenty of HARD toonz. I caught the end of Jordan Vesteyo's mental trance
set. Next up was Joey Beltram not hard enough but he kept it groovin'. Then
Disintegrator went on and played some wicked old skool Hardcore, their
first being 'Lock on Target' had me jumpin' for joy. The Surgeon went on
and cut up more hard, tweaked out beats. I kept dancing. I thought the
relentless onslaught of beats would end, but to no avail, Dj Hell went on
and about halfway through his set my back went wack. I chose to ignore the
spasm and went on dancing. Then my kn
ees stopped working and thats about the time when I chose to stop dancing
and start bobbing. I stood near the Dj booth and watched Hell continue to
pound out his grooves. Then Miss Marilyn went on and I promptly left to
find other things to do. Mainly meet up with Moonshadow and a few others I
had seen earlier. Unfortunatley my search was hopeless. Carlos was
enjoyable, always a nice vibe with Carlos @ the wheels. Dubtribe was
Dubtribe... kinda thought they should have been raised a bit so the crowd
could have seen them better. Groovee. Dipi was kool his MC was kinda
kracked however. Lighthearted ending to an overwhealming night. Thanx
Patrick for a wonderful evening. No makeup necessary (However if there is
one I'll be there)

gals and guys,
   i made a huge error when i announced that moby would be in pitt this
weekend with diamanda gallas.  see when i checked out moby's tour info on
the web, i saw diamanda's name there too, and assumed they were performing
together.  little did i know that the tour info was not just for moby, but
for all mute artists (diamanda being one of them) and i just mixed the two
together.  i'm really sorry if i got anyone's hopes up for nothing.  really
i am.

love,                   p.s.- geoff and xavier....i'm really really sorry.

    Did I read that correctly?  Is there no jungle?

    Or is Sine going to spin some of his kickin' hardstep?

    I'm excited, though... when is DB going to come back to town?  I'd
like to hear him spin again... (I'm not in NY enough)

A portion of a Delphinic enscription:

  Come pure in heart and touch the lustral wave
  One drop sufficeth for the sinless mortal

Some people have requested more info on Delphi itself:

  DELPHI, the seat of the most celebrated oracle of ancient Greece, situated on
  the lower slopes of Mount Parnassus, at an elevation of nearly 2,000 feet
  (600 meters), some 6 miles (9 km) from the north shore of the Corinthian Gulf.
  Here, in a rugged defile of the mountain where the two Shining Rocks, the
  Phaedriades of the ancients, meet at an obtuse angle, the Castalian Spring
  gushes forth and forms a stream, which joins the Pleistus River south of the
  Sanctuary. The scenery is of overpowering grandeur and solitude, and there is
  no doubt that the landscape largely determined the location of the oracle.
  Delphi was symbolically the center of the universe, the exact spot marked by
  the Omphalos (navel), a stone shaped like a half egg, usually banded with
  woolen fillets, or ribbons. The Omphalos was the earth's navel. According to
  the myth the two eagles of Zeus, starting from the opposite ends of the earth,
  met at this point.

Does anyone wants to schedule a net meet at Journey to Delphi ?

I could put the info on the main flyer coming out next week and
on the info line with the directions if desired.

btw:  There will be a few thousand color pre-flyers out this weekend at
the following events:

  Fri:  Dubtribe @ the daily double, Akron, OH

        ?, < some skate park >, NYC

  Sat:  Jak's Bak, Detroit

        Black Out 2, NYC

These are only single sided but since Joel has been sick, we had to use the
ad copy from Drop magazine for a quick 5K run.

In a message dated 96-10-22 10:39:53 EDT, you write:

<< Just take it easy, everyone.  Think twice before you post something to the
 list in anger.  The list is for discussion, not for recess time bickering.

You're  right, Tom.  I yelled in anger, and although I said what I thought,
_how_ I said it was prolly inappropriately hostile.  Sorry for sullying the
list.

I'm willing to credit your good intentions, but a little knowledge 
is a dangerous thing. There is no, and has never been a "Good Times"
virus. The original warning was a hoax intended to fool the extremely
gullable and computer illiterate. It has been doing just that for
several years now as people like you panic and spam it all over the
net without bothering to check their sources.

E-mail comes with no macro capability and runs across many diverse
platforms. This makes it practically impossible for it to contain
a virus, particularly like the one discribed.

As for the "pkzip300" trojan horse, I would check with a realiable
source of virus information before worrying. 

Given the nasty competition which has plagued pkzip, I wouldn't be
surprised if this isn't a smear campaign.

In general, practise safe computing. Use a virus checker and only
download what you actually need. Stick with reliable repositories
and always use a rubber (prophylactic for you UK types :) ).

u sed:
==================================================================
me:  i'm a Texas Raver.  one of the original 7 or 8 or so.  i'm not from tx
==================================================================

funny, i'm one of the original 7 or 8 or so cleveland ravahs

==================================================================
what kind of music gets played at parties there?
==================================================================

ian mariano spins trance @ the church on sundays
rob sherwood spins house "  "    "     "    "   
mike filly spins breaks  "  "    "     "    "
sleepy c spins funky house/morning acid/trance/pure techno
dan curtin spins house/intelligent techno/detroit tracks
gank spins detroit techno/chicago hard house
mike sparx spins funky house/chicago hard house/detroit techno
tik tak spins jungle
release spins slo breaks/trip hop/funky house
dreamer spins funky house/progressive house/electro
there are others but i'm too lazy to go on...

cleveland started w/ house w/ rob & dan                 
filly wuz alwaze in there w/ his breaks   
scott forbush imported the hardcore/gabber
ian, his prodigical son, took trance to a new dimension
sleepy c lead the underground w/ his version of trance & acid

dreamer, release, gank, sparx, and tik tak are the current 216 heroes

oh if yur big on lables...                                         

ian mariano - trilogy/the church, wanker records, katt technologies, etc.
rob sherwood - trilogy/ the church, strictly rhythym, blah blah blah
mike filly - trilogy/the church, reinforce, i dunno some breaks lables...
dan curtin - peacefrog, metamorphic, turned on, turned off, the clapper
sleepy c - psychoactive, sm:)e, ava <- his own lable, music @ the brillo pad

gank & sparx - spawntaneous productions
tik tak - basehead productions
dreamer - dreamer productions
release - deep records <- sleepy c's ole record store (now defunct)

i'm sick of talkin' about the music next question...

=======================================================================
do net-ravers hang out together?
=======================================================================

rarely...me & joe (187) & hossam hit a party in toronto way back in the
stone ages...went to toronto again w/ jeff/stuff...kate picked me up @
the airport...ian i met thru scotty...i think i explained the various 
types of techno to braden @ FA1...trouty saved my backpack...i interviewed
tom for one of my last PLRM's (peace love rave magazine - the zine i used
to do)...ed i met by goin to all those ele mental partys...colin took
us to the coolest diner in warren...desmond i met thru walt & jenny...
i could go on, but alas u have no clue who any of these people are...
suffice it to say i know alotta people...in cleveland i'm known as the
'hook up man'...but just about none of these people i met thru the net 
...mostly cuz nobody ever makes it to net meets cuz ravers have no sense of
time (too busy dancin or socializin or whatever).

========================================================================
what's the vibe like?
========================================================================

could be better...vibe is what u make of it tho

========================================================================
avg. cost of a one bedroom apt. (or efficiency?)
is there a more artsy-oriented part of town to live in?  parts of town to
stay away from?
how are the record stores there?
========================================================================

uhm..$230? - dats how much my pad costs, but i've got the whole 3rd floor,
free parking, free washer & dryer, free cable, free electricity & gas...
altho i lived as cheap as $130/month 

definitely coventry village (east side), i guess the west side is s'posed
to be purdy kewl but i don't live there, stay away from east cleveland -
ghetto country

deep records wuz kewl, but now it's no longer...there's some decent stores
on the west side...but best bet is makin the 3 hour drive to detroit for
submerge or record time

...jonathan tea, huh...what are u, farmer tea's long lost cousin?

...enuff procrastination for now...

I am no longer w/Wanker.  I'm doing the Vocal Planet Inc. thing :)  Katt
Technologies/Trans Trance Technologies (tCubed) is a part of that.  The
only problem w/label running is capital...eeeeeek. ;P

As far as net.ravers hangin' out:  I know a few, we just see each other out
at parties and stuff [sic]...It seems like cleveland ravers hang out
elsewhere when not @ parties.  A bit spread out, but I like a lot of 'em.

We do have a neat history as far as "rave" music goes here in cleveland.
Stevie T was _always_ supportive.  And so are the kidz here.  I must
publicly (as always) thank them.  Cleveland kidz KNOW THEIR MUSIC.  They're
what have truely driven the scene here forward.  We provide the
"information," and they take it to its heights :)  It is because of those
kidz that I strive for excellence in my profession - that and my love of
the music...

The Good Times virus is a hoax.  It has been around the internet for many
years, and it keeps coming back to haunt.  There is no danger in reading
email on your system (unless you are using Lotus Notes).  Executing random
attachments you recive *can* be dangerous, but no email message is going
to eat your hard drive.

So all you ghouls and such:

  Are you going to materialize for the fun pagan festival of "High Evil"?
I haven't been around the local spots, but I haven't seen a flyer or
anything for it - so is it still going down?  It sounds horriffically
good, especially if many lost souls show up with 'evil-costumery'.  if
it's happenin' I'll definately show up with a bag of tricks and treats. ;)
Mwuahahahahahaha!

On a sad note, my glorious pics of Bassrush: formation did NOT come out at
ALL! ahhhh!  So my advice is not to use those "Rite-aid" brand one-time
cameras if you'r going to keep them in your pocket all night.  
(anyone else have any pics from it?)

Hi ya all.
Just two short questions:

1) Is there any -respectable- music store in Pittsburgh that carries a go=
od load
    of rave material. I am not talking about the ones where you never kno=
w where rave
   is (could be in pop, could in rap, could be -whatever), but where you =
know you will
   find good music from the rave scene?
2) Any info on the new album of The Prodigy?

Thanks,

If you want stuff 'from the rave-scene' I'd try and get various mixtapes.
Most any local dj has them, including some on this list.
You can get a variety of tapes vinyl & some cds at:
 "Goodvibes" in oakland - it's on atwood street on the left a block or so
past the Spice Island Tea House.  Not often open, though.
 "Protokulture" at club 168 downtown on 3rd ave.  I'm not sure when it's
open anymore, though.
 there's lots of stuff at:
 "FutureSounds" which is on ardmore blvd, and has a homepage at:
              
            http://www.dhp.com/~futursnd/

Those are the only 100% "rave" related music shops - Vibes in oakland has
lots of CDs, and so does the Blockbuster music in Ross Township, and there
are loads of mail-order shops that have good variety.  I can email you
addresses if your interested. I only wish we had one big vinyl store
actuall IN the city.  That'd be great.

> 2) Any info on the new album of The Prodigy?

sorry nope.

Yes, please.

I agree with that.

Hey Pete, YOU HAVE BEEN SUCKERED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please attempt to obtain the nearest clue as soon as possible.
This BOGUS "GOOD TIMES" EMAIL-VIRUS has been around for YEARS now.

Notice the followig EXAGGERATIONS:

On 29 Oct 96 at 0:28, pete e:p sysko pulled this from the center of the 
Ultraworld:

> >>ATTN:  ALL WESTINGHOUSE COMMUNICATIONS PERSONNEL

Oh, inter-office memo?? Makes it looks professional, huh?

> >>Subject: Important Virus Info
> >>
> >>Just a reminder about a virus that has been spread via Internet Email

> >> has a virus that rewrites your hard drive, obliterating anything on
> >>it.
> >> Please be careful and forward this warning to anyone you care about.

This is EXACTLY what is happening, and is the intent of the creator of this
BOGUS virus story.  Very much like that chain-letter from St.Peter (or whoever)
that says "mail this letter to 10 people or else YOU WILL DIE!!!!!!!!!!!! "

> >> The FCC released a warning last Wednesday concerning a matter of

A user on AMERICA ONLINE??  YA RIGHT!!  You see, pete, this is a big joke.

Over-hype of the "destructiveness."

WHAT THE PHUQ IS AN Nth-COMPLEXITY INFINITE BINARY LOOP ???

ANSWER:  some made up bullshit!

Ya, right.  WHICH mail program?  All of them?  Sure.  On ALL PLATFORMS??

I am a Computer Science major, and you can quote me: THIS IS BULLSHIT!!


> >> <2   DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANY FILE NAMED PKZIP300 REGARDLESS

> >>

This PKZIP300, on the other hand, *could* be a potential virus.
I took this one seriously when I first saw it, but
have not actually confirmed if it's real or not.

But on the "GOOD TIMES" thing, you have just needlessly worried MORE people,
but then, there's a sucker born every second...

I hope that this follow-up of mine will stop this branch of distribution
of this bogus virus notification.  It's simply intended to be a waste of
time, and appears to have succeeded -- you may now call ME a sucker! :)

peace,
-kc

Scott's doing well on his boat in Houston.  He's doing some producing, too
:)  Not gabbah or hahdcoh, but a blues singer!  It's actually pretty good.

Capital in general.  But things are looking good.

Don't know.  Don't speak w/him much.

I'm not amused!   I am writing from my brothers computer because upon
reading the message titled "Good Times" my computer locked up and my hard
drive began working and I couldn't stop it until it was totally destroyed! 
The virus skipped to my CD ROM and my Zip drive and destroyed them both.  I
have yet to check my floppy drives.  Somehow it jumped across my room and
wiped out all the sample info that I had stored on my Jazz drive discs and
it erased all patch memories on my synth gear and ruined the oscilator
tuning of all my analog gear!!!!!!
NOT to mention that your "BOO!!!!!!!" in the body of your message scared me
sooooo much that I jumped back in my chair so hard that I fell backwards,
hit my head on and broke my glass table, knocking a lit candle onto the
floor.  In my 1/2 conscious state I was unable to react to the flames that
were spreading throughout my room.  Only after my room was fully engulfed
by flames and I had received 3rd degree burns over 40 per cent did I
realize how much bandwidth I was wasting with this message.
=)
PEACE!

be there for a whoppping day...but damn, everybody go to high evil for me
because if it is anything like The Final Comedown or Electric Kingdom, it's

RE: ROADTRIP EAST : 11/96 - 1/97


This message is being distributed to all lists east of AZ in order to
solicit information and gain contacts in the Midwest and on the East Coast.

Three of us from Phoenix, AZ are making the long trip east this winter to
spend some time on the East Coast.  We're leaving Arizona sometime between
November 12-15 on GREYHOUND BUS LINES with a route traversing the Midwest.
Our first destination on the E.C. is BALTIMORE, MD for Ultraworld's PHOENIX
event on November 30.  We are hoping to make some stops in the Midwest on
the way to B-More.  After the party 11/30, we're planning to head north to
visit cities and scenes in the North East.  Each of us we'll be visiting
different parts of the E.C. and leaving for Arizona at different times. 
CHRIS wants to be back in AZ for Christmas.  DENNY wants to return shortly
after New Years.  I (JEH) won't be going back to AZ until mid-January.

The reason this message is being sent is to hopefully find some people in
the Midwest and on the E.C. to help us out with information on:

1. ONE-OFF EVENTS / SHOWS (for November, December, and January)
2. UNDERGROUND CLUBS
3. PLACES TO STAY (preferably with net-ravers in major cities)
4. TRANSPORTATION (in & between major cities)
5. PEOPLE TO MEET! (from all scenes) =)

Here is a list of cities we'll be visiting...

FLAGSTAFF, AZ		PITTSBURGH, PA		BOSTON, MASS.
ALBUQUERQUE, NM		BALTIMORE, MD		SYRACUSE, NY
OKLAHOMA CITY, OK	WASHINGTON, DC		TORONTO, CAN
ST. LOUIS, MO		PHILLY, PA		MONTREAL, CAN
INDIANAPOLIS, IN	NEW YORK CITY, NY
COLUMBUS, OH		CLEVELAND, OH		(maybe more...)

Here is a short bio on each of us...

JEH: Lived in Phoenix since 1988. Travelled/lived thru-out the
Midwest, South East/West, and California. Event Promoter / Production.    
Known as "JEH" on IRC/V-Rave.

DENNY: Lived in Phoenix all of life, w/ short time in Austin, TX. Professed 
"candy raver".  Ran a
Punk/HC label, distributing compilations and putting on shows in AZ and TX.
Known as "NIMH" on IRC/V-Rave. 

CHRIS: Lived in Phoenix since 1995. Came from B-more/DC area. Travelled/lived
thru-out the East Coast and South (Florida, NC/SC). Part of Unitarian
Church, went to conferences on the E.C. Event Promoter / Production.   
Known as "MUNK-E" on IRC/V-Rave.  

All three of us have backgrounds in the Punk/Hardcore, Goth/Industrial,
Hip Hop/Breakbeat, and Rave/Techno scenes. 

So, if any of you have information that mite be beneficial to us on our
trip, please send e-mail or call ASAP!  That way we'll be sure not to miss
you on our trip!

Thanks in advance...

aawww damn, somebody rich needs to give me money so I don't have to work and
I can travel the country in search of the next cool event.

ASA parties are phat, and Starchild is DA BOMB!!!!!  Last time i heard him
was at Koncrete Jungle Philly (after he spun at KJ NYC--the resume checks
out!) (sup chris?) and he blew my head with funkified drum-n-bass with mad
hip hop spun in like I've never heard it done before!  The boy takes it from
the inside out, not just sample dropping a vocal lick here and there, but
really mixing it, blending it, like cookie dough.  well, you know what i
mean.

And he spins a mean hip hop set as well, needless to say!  I'll be not in
Pgh, either spending my last dime at a show or sitting at home miserable that
I'm not spending my last dime at a show.  :(
