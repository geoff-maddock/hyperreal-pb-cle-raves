Pittsburgh-Cleveland Raves

Welcome to pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org!

Please save this message so that you know the address you are
subscribed under, in case you later want to unsubscribe or change your
subscription address.

*** I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS.  I AM 
*** ASSUMING ALL LISTMEMBERS HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS,
*** YOU WILL BE UNSUBSCRIBED WITHOUT WARNING FOR FAILURE 
*** TO FOLLOW THESE RULES.

** Pittsburgh-Cleveland Rave List
	POSTS: pb-cle-raves@hyperreal.org
	REQUESTS: pb-cle-raves-request@hyperreal.org
	WWW: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/
	R0M: http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/

Posts to the list WILL BOUNCE UNLESS YOU POST FROM THE ADDRESS YOU
SUBSCRIBED FROM!!!!!

Also note:  ALL POSTS ARE ARCHIVED, THAT MEANS THEY ARE KEPT 
ON THE WEB AT HYPERREAL, INDEXED BY DATE, AUTHOR, SUBJECT, AND
THREAD.  BEAR IN MIND THAT HOTBOT AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES 
TROLL THEM AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO CAN USE A
SEARCH ENGINE. I WILL NOT REMOVE POSTS MADE IN HASTE OR 
OTHERWISE. I AM ALSO NOT LIABLE FOR CONTENT, AS I AM NOT THE
AUTHOR OF MESSAGES. (well except mine!)

okay, let me explain VERY clearly....  

*** blatant/excessive talk of drug use/abuse is off topic, i think i need
*** to make that very clear to the new members.
***
*** it reflects very poorly on the whole of this list and the rave scene.
***
*** there are other place to discuss this sort of thing, take it there.
***
*** i really don't think most members care to see alot of the crap about 
*** drugs and the ensuing "don't post about drugs" messages/arguement.

the cliff's notes version of the rules:

For profit commercial advertising (including djs soliciting gigs or
selling mixtapes), posting of events CLEARLY out of the region, or
repeated posting of events is prohibited.

also of major annoyance is "BSP" or Blatant Self Promotion.  its all fine
and dandy that you are looking for bookings or have a new mp3 out, but we
don't need to be constantly reminded of it. For the occasional post, 
"BSP" MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE HEADER.  YOU WILL BE BLOCKED, YOU HAVE BEEN 
WARNED.  this includes webcast reminders for people out of the region.

**Attachments and HTML messages are not to be used**.  If you really want
to send a file to the list, please put it at a web site and just send the
URL, if you don't have a web site, try geocities.com.
 If you're using Microsoft Outlook, Internet Exploder, or Netscape to
write email, learn how to turn off the "HTML encoding." People on Unix
shells can't read it, and don't care enough to save the attachment.
 Using AOL 6.0? read this or your msgs might be bounced due to aol
stupidity, http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#aol6html ("so easy
no wonder it's number one .... FOR ME TO POOP ON!!!!")

No arguing about which genre's suck.

Only one subscription per individual.  This is to prevent creating ghost
accounts for the purposes of harrasment, hiding your identity, or getting
around the quota. *if* you need to post under a different address than
your subscribed address, such as a different address at work, etc, email
trout@hyperreal.org and request arrangements.

There is a "something" message per day limit.  Use them wisely.  I will
not forward them to the list.  i change it based on list traffic.  as of 
summer 2004 its set to 20 or so.

Posts should be rave related, if you MUST post an off topic message, post 
them to the OFF-TOPIC LIST.  todd runs that somewhere.

"me too!" and "i agree" posts are frowned up and make you look like an
idiot.

Forwarding private messages to the list that are not intended to be public
are bad.

Deliberate attacks on members is MOST UNWELCOME.  Attacks on non-members
are idiotic, becasue, well they aren't on the list and not welcome either.
Abuse will not be tolerated.  this is at my discretion, there will be no
warnings.  you will be unsubbed.

this is a very important one:
Morons ARE NOT WELCOME.

If you are new to the internet experience, sheltered on AOL, or just plain
don't know netiquette, please read any of these:
http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html
http://www.etiquette.net/
http://www.iwillfollow.com/email.htm
http://promotions.yahoo.com/promotions/netiquette/tips.html
http://www.emilypost.com/etiquette.htm

*List by-law 9.14.412: Let it be clearly stated, understood and accepted
as fact that Tom Cox (aka "tmo" or "cracker ass cracker") is infallible
in opinion, thought and word (but not deed...he done done some fucked up
shit in his time), including but not limited to matters of pure opinion,
actual scientific fact (despite any and all credible scientific evidence
providing proof to the contrary), conjecture, and hearsay.

also before you ask what ROAR is on the list--
"it means they have a lion guarding the door to make sure you pay!" -
michael knight.
no really it means:
  R-ight
  O-f
  A-dmission
  R-eserved (sometimes refusal)
which means they don't have to let you in for any real reason whatsoever.

To subscribe, send email to pb-cle-raves-subscribe@hyperreal.org.

To unsubscribe, pb-cle-raves-unsubscribe@hyperreal.org

For special requests--contact listadmin:

	trout@hyperreal.org

Please note that the listadmin reserves the right to unsubscribe anyone
for more or less any reason, not limited to excessive bouncing of email,
sending attachments or other extremely long posts, spamming (which
includes repeated reposting of events), rudeness, vulgarity, bad hairdo,
mailing "virus alerts", mailing chain letters, etc....

Subject: {pb-cle} £200 (US$380) should be the bottom line rate 

It depends on factors including size of venue, distance travelled, day of 
the
week, length of relationship with the promoter etc. It's therefore very
difficult to put a figure on how much you should be charging, but if it's a 
main
slot, the bare minimum as an unknown would be, say, a couple of hundred 
pounds.

Judge Jules recommends £200 (US$380) should be the bottom line rate for new 
DJs

They NEW that it was a breath mint but was afraid that it might be laced so
i got to spend 3 days in flint mich jail for a fucking breath mint. My
friends went home with tickets my keys and coat. The cops released me
almost 70 hours after they pulled the altoid out of my pocket. I was
stranded in another city with no money, coat, keys and a dead phone. I am

For a DJ in a major city, and considering that London is one of the
most expensive cities on earth, if you're playing in a club, that's

Or mayhaps he thinks a DJ should be worth paying that much for before
anyone should book them.  That, I'd believe.

Alright people, I finally got off my ass (for the WMC) and made a new mix called Evasive Maneuvers.I handed quite a few out at whats next before we all got arrested. Check it out you can download it from http:/www.ultrasoundz.net. Pay no attention to the bio, it needs updated. I am not one to divulge my track list, so tuff titties bitches.LOL! Personally I feel I did great for a live set seeing as how I am not a robot. I take constructive criticism unless you suck or are a tool. I hope you all enjoy it.

I am a liitle late in responding to this but I was the one spinning when they came in. It sucked, but the ACLU has assigned like 12 lawyers to assist us in getting this fixed. Wish us all luck as we start our court battle on thurs. I am not sure flint is expecting whats about to happen. A lot of people there have a good case for civil suits. And so it begins.....................

Good luck Frank, and thanks for reminding me to send
some money to the ACLU.

You know, imnsho, if you do nothing else sending money
to the ACLU is probably the best thing that you can
do. It doesn't require you to sign a letter that you
didn't write, or, write a letter that you'd be willing
to sign. It doesn't require a phone call. If you're
paranoid it doesn't require you to attach your name to
anything. Futhermore, it doesn't have to be a recuring
gift. Send them $10 or $20 or whatever you can afford.
Send it in a postal money order from anonymous if you
need to. 

I can't think of ANYTHING that the ACLU has fought for
that I don't believe in.  

ymmv.

Technoir Audio Q&A

>How long has Technoir Audio been?

technoirs been together for about 3 or 4 years now it our current
form. its always changing though, we have 7 releases out to date. 6
vinyl eps. and one full length cd album.

>Any confusion/tension collaborating?

no. not at all really.. we all have our own studios so there's 
usually always enough time to do your own things as well.

>The collective in the near future?

id like to see all of us make it overseas. but multiple flights and 
hotels cost a bundle.. plus its also scheduling time off from 
everyone's jobs and getting people to book technoir as a collective.. 
its like booking a band.

>Next piece of gear?

production will never ever be stress free. the more complicated
machines become, the less likely they are to work on a regular basis!
I like things that are effective at one thing really.. so its kinda
hard these days to find something thats really good at one things and
not trying to doo 30000 other things

>Key influence?

for others i cant really say.. for myself.. cevin key from skinny 
puppy, keith lablanc from tackhead/sugarhill gang, derrick may, stacy 
pullen and carl craig, depeche mode and new order, portishead, 
kraftwerk,... there's so many people i can name that have influenced 
me.

>Where can people purchase your music

we don't sell anything from our site, believe it or not. we
sell all of our stuff through distributors. the best place on the net
to get our stuff is probably at www.submerge.com. they are the best
really. or www.planetxusa.com all of our releases can be listened to 
on our site www.technoiraudio.com

fill out some paperwork. I've never givin money to
anything like the ACLU or NORML, but I think those two

I know this is probably a dumb question, and although I work at a parts =
store, I can't seem to find what the problem is with my car still.=20

If anyone knows a little something and could throw me some suggestions, =
I would highly appreciate it.

Thanks much.

Well, teachers love to regurgitate the old saw that
there's no such thing as a dumb question, but of
course, it's not really true, now is it?

I think I can, it's broken and needs to be fixed. If
you nee more specfic help than that you might want to
consider asking a LESS dumb question that would
include 
at least SOME details of the problem.
 
> Thanks much.

Any time.

For your information mister smart ass, I wasnt going to sit here and type
out every detail of what my car is doing, considering this is a "rave" topic
list. I took it upon myself of asking if maybe,.... just maybe someone would
email me back asking what my issue on my car was. Then Id happen to go into
detail with that person that emailed me back..

If I wanted a smart ass comment from you, Id just ask you to bend over so I
could stick a brick in your ass. But that wasn't rave related either..

Your future in comedy seems about as bright as your
future in the auto biz. You might want to avoid
"people" jobs too. That is, at least when you're
having your "ladies time".

You might want to avoid the pb-cle list while you're at it. Seems the
"people" don't think to highly of you as it is.

What a jab guy. Can you think of anything better?

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

THE FOUR FOUR!

Josh The Funky 1
1am-2:30am - Funky House
“Universal Sound” CD Release Tour
System Recordings/ Funktion / Fused - Chicago
Josh "The Funky 1" hails from Chicago, the home of House Music. A DJ for 
over 12 years, Josh blends a unique style of funky house, tech-house, 
and breaks, while incorporating ill-scratching and turntable tricks. 
Josh's passion for the art of DJ'ing first came about when he discovered 
hip-hop while still in grade school. A fan of early pioneering hip-hop 
groups like Public Enemy, EPMD, and Eric B and Rakim, he was enthralled 
by the art of scratching. One day a friend lent Josh a videotape of a DJ 
battle, which unknowingly turned out to be a D.M.C. battle, the most 
renowned DJ battle in the world. Mesmerized by what he saw could be done 
with 2 turntables and a mixer, Josh practiced and honed his skills 
relentlessly. His passion and persistence proved to be worthwhile, as he 
has since displayed his skills in some of the most prestigious DJ 
battles in the world. 1997 saw Josh became a D.M.C Midwest Finalist.
In 1999 Josh competed in the Winter Music Conference scratching 
competition where he was a runner up to 3-time world champion DJ Craze. 
In the year 2000, Josh took 1st place in the beat-mixing competition at 
the Winter Music Conference DJ spin-off.
Aside from competing, Josh's passion for music has led him to compile 
several mix compilations including his own "House Funktion" series, 
which showcases his diverse music selection and wicked turntable skills. 
Josh has also helped to co-produce legendary D.J., Bad Boy Bill's , 
"Bangin the Box Vol. 4" and "Banging in London" mix compilations. He 
hasn't ripped up the floor sinces Quikk Fixx 5. so get ready for his 
scratching skills and banging selection! It's time once agian for Josh 
The Funky 1!

David Christopher aka Deviant

Quikk Fixx and he will be rocking the floor. David is simply amazing, He 
keeps the dance floor moving non stop with the smoothest mixes. In 
addition as part of Balance Record pool he has the same hot track 
selection as djs like Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyke, John Digweed. 
Sasha. David has been playing since day one and year after year he 
hasn't disappointed.

Mike Parkay
12:00pm-1:00am - Funky House
The Bubble/Vibe 315 - Utica
Mike Parkay is one of the reason why we have a scene today. Plugging 
away and keep the party going night after night Mike give his whole 
heart and soul to us in every set and every production. As half of the 
Bubble and 1/3 of Vibe 315 Mike Keeps busy. Tonight He's going to keep 
you busy by giving you the Funkiest shit to groove to. You know Mike 
Parkay is on the decks when you see those asses shakin'!

skills on djsourceradeo.co.uk. Meta X has been playing Quikk Fixx ever 
since it began five years ago.. Tonight he will be spreading the vibe to

GAC Productions in assocation
with Brokenbeats and Gettup Massive Present :

THE BASS!

Stakka
2am-3am - Drum and Bass
Cargo Industries/The Militia - Brighton, UK
If you don't know who this is.. You might be missing the entire point of 
drum and bass! Shaun Morris, aka Stakka, has led his own digital 
revolution in music from a young age. As a teenager in Brighton, England 
in the 80’s, he took notice of the epic compositions of Jean-Michel 
Jarre. The futuristic sounds of the synthesizer and the catchy riffs 
relentlessly mutating into the next would find their way into Stakka’s 
insistent and unearthly sound. Evolution of that sound brought him to 
launching Cargo Industries at the start of 2003. The label is a mutated 
hybrid offspring of his style, past recordings, and label affiliations. 
Under Stakka creative control, Cargo will force-feed the evolution of 
Drum’n’Bass. Stakka has cut more plates then you can count and 
colaborations with the like of Andy C and more He is going to tear apart 
Upstate!

Reid Speed
3am-4am - Drum and Bass
Breakbeat Science/ESDJCO - Los Angeles
Reid Speed has had a pretty great year. In the fourteen months since her 
first mix CD, Resonance, on Breakbeat Science Recordings, she conquered 
a 35-date tour, moved to Los Angeles, secured a national ad campaign 
with Triple 5 Soul, and was selected as the official DJ for a network 
comedy show. As the perfect finish to her outstanding debut year, Reid 
Speed now releases her powerful new drum + bass mix CD, Life After Dark, 
a reflection of her packed dancefloor sets that illuminates the depth of 
her selection and the full spectrum of her talent as a DJ. This is her 
first apearance upstate in over 6 years!

Rob Gee
1am-2am - Hardcore
ADAM Recordings - New York
Few DJs can play music that hits hard as hell and moves a crowd to 
dance. Few can write original songs that make you want to sing. Only a 
special artist can play live in front of 1 million people. ROB GEE does 
all this and more. He's famous in New York as "the hardest DJ to ever 
play the Limelight." The crowds kept coming back to Limelight, just like 
they did in Italy, Ibiza, Scotland, Austria, Belgium, Holland's 
THUNDERDOME PARTIES and MYSTERYLAND FESTIVALS, France's MIDEM, and 
Germany's LOVE PARADE, where GEE played before 1 Million people in 1996. 
His indecisiveness as to whether or not he wanted to break dance and 
spin hip hop or jump in the mosh pit and play in a metal band was one of 
the reasons he began to cultivate his own style of both. While others 
are just spinning records, GEE is a true entertainer.

Annalyze
12am-1am - Breakbeat
Skyehigh/Fused/Stanton - Rochester
Rochester NY's leading lady of 2-Step/Break-Beat, Annalyze has been 
regularly rocking the Upstate scene. During her DJ set's, Anna combines 
an energetic stage presence with the hottest tracks in break-beat/2-Step 
genre, as well as DMC scratching and turntable trickery, creating a vibe 
that keeps the dance floor packed and moving all night long. Having 
established a reputation as a constant crowd pleaser, Anna can often be 
found stepping away from the turntables, and joining the crowd on the 
dance floor during one of her legendary DJ sets. Get ready for Annalyzes 
first appearance at Quikk Fixx!

Milkdud vs Silas Maximus
11pm-12am - Old School Jungle
Intellectual property vs Gettup Massive/Vibe 315 - Albany vs Auburn
Allright everyone this is it, the moment you have been waiting for. The 
only junglist to play every Quikk Fixx mashes out with the Godfather of 
the Gettup Massive. If you've heard them Individually then you know what 
time it is.. Time for those classics. This is going to hurt you where it 
counts AMEN! Know what I mean.

Plume vs Ganixx
10pm-11pm - Drum and Bass
Brokenbeats/Dream Research vs Hyphonic - Binghamton vs Ithaca
Two of the hard hitter of the drum and bass scene.. Two that are much 
more the just a DJ. They continue to push the scene foward with hot 
mixes and event production.. Exposing new heads to new beats. These two 
turn people onto the sounds by making the dance floor explode like no 
one else can. Reeeeeeeeeeespek!

Meniscus vs Modulate
9pm-10pm - Breaks
Brokenbeats/Tangent vs Metrosoul/1300 - Binghamton vs Syracuse
These two have been at every single Quikk Fixx since the very first

May 28-30                          FUSE-IN                          Detroit

deeeetroit like a muthafukka

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned
for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic 
Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am ::

In the late eighties Raida gained prominence as a member of the New 
York-based crew the X-Men who later became known as the X-ecutioners. 
Champions of furthering the turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made 
their reputation by utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the 
manual alteration between individual kick and snare sounds to create 
original drum patterns in real time. This practice has been an 
inspiration and a force in Roc Raida's style. His impressive finishes 
in some of the premier DJ battles; (first place in the 1991 "As One"; 
second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an 
episode of "Saturday Night Live"; (the first DJ to ever) has made him an 
american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hop’s 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such 
exotic locations as Singapore, Turkey, Japan and Australia. Roc Raida is 
considered among the best of the contemporary DJ's and has brought the 
underground art of Turntablism to a fresh new level.

I don't think that's spelled correctly ed. I'm pretty
sure gay-mail has a spell check for you to use.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Tonight@Havana - HYPNOTYZA vs. COUNT ZERO

Frank and I met up last night and worked out some of what we're going to
play...we're both really excited to be playing together for the first time
since last summer, when we rocked the roof off the pavilion in Schenley
Park!!!

Expect housey, broken-y, tech-y, dub-y, electro-y sound patterns to pass
through your eardrums at various intervals throughout the evening...in
short: DON'T expect 2 hours of the same old thing...this should be unique
and fun, and, rain be damned, it should still be a great spring evening to
come to Havana and enjoy a sangria or two...

I'll be debuting at least one new track and a handfull of custom edits and
mixes of tracks, plus my usual bag of sampled goodies. Frank will be rocking
some classics and some leftfield shizz that he doesn't normally get a chance
to play outside the confines of "Camp Count Zero"...and hopefully, it will
all congeal into a nice jello salad of funky beats for dancin' and
romancin'....

Again, thanks to Jason C and Mr. Senor Love Daddy Brother Mike for their
hospitality and perpetual chilled-ness.

I didnt ask for a guess. I asked if there was anyone that happen to know
about car repairs, not if anyone knew how to start bullshit drama.

But this is the pb-cle.  If someone simply asking for help about 
something DIDN'T result in bullshit drama, I'd be worried.

Christ, what's so hard to understand about that?

Subject: {pb-cle} fifteen inches of pleasure.....times two....?

See,

I'm tired of lugging the subs out to small outdoor
events and I'm thinking of buying some 2x15 two/three
way PA cabs.  I'm considering stuff like
community/jbl/cerwin-vega etc..

Now, in the past I've always used JBL-SR/SRX stuff
cause it's really predictable and commonly available,
but, I don't really want to spend that much money this
time.

Has anyone used JBL MRPRO series? How do they compare
to the SRX series stuff?  Is there anything that
really stands out (other than say how much gemeni
sucks) in terms of power handling, reliablity, and
sound?

I will be powering them with either a Mackie M2600 or
two M1400's in bridged mode.

Thanks in advance for, what I anticipate, will be MOST
HELPFUL reply.

Im not going to sit here and play baby games with you ok? I simply posted
something harmless on this list, since I know most of everyone here (and
your some cunt fuck that lurked onto here) and asked a simple question.
You,.. decided to pick apart my email and caused a issue that wasn't even
called for.

Do yourself a favor, and stop acting like you can spin records, and stick to
your hippy shows.

From: 	nat2+@pitt.edu



This terribly early and in advanc but I'm looking for some DJ's of any genre who would be interested in participating in a charity event that will be scheduled tentatively for November 12th.  This is going to be run through the University of Pittsburgh and its going to be for a 24 hour dance marathon to raise money (The charity hasn't officially been decided upon yet). We're trying to make this a major event for not only the University but the community as well.  I'm trying to get in contact with anyone who would be interesting in spinning or anything out of the goodness of their hearts, because we're on a limited budget as is.  If you know of anyone who is remotely interested, can you help me get in contact with them and see if you could work something out.  Or if you could post this announcement that would be awesome too.  
Thank you!
Nikki

If this is tonight, does anyone know what the timeslots are?  The last bus out 
of the Strip is at 12:15AM, and I'd like to know who I could hear before then.

wow.

just ended like 20 minutes ago.

for those not playing along at home, it started BEFORE 3 (i know i hit the
site at about 2:30 and they were already going...), so they went about 8
hours!

i recorded as much of it as i could, but i did miss the beginning of the
"official" 3 pm start time (got in and realized i wasn't recording just
after they started the public enemy track), and when i ran out of space on
my D: drive, I missed about 70 minutes. i got most of the last hour, though.

if anyone else recorded it and got more than me, hit me up private-style,
and let me know if we can do a little trade or something.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Quick recap on Halo last night.OMG! By far one of the best house sets I've ever heard. I saw him tear it up in Columbus not to long ago and this set was even better. I was kinda bummed early on in the night cause of the venue change, but once he came on that didn't even matter.It was great seeing all the house fans, Napoleon, Doug, Darrel, Ray thanks for all the dope pics, and Darrel thanks for the CD's. I was also glad to catch some of Jamie's set and run into a few other people at Midnight Mixer. Was wondering does anyone know detailed info on Halo playing in Columbus this weekend? I may possibly be going down, just can't get enough...
 
Also, heads up to anyone who is interested in advertising in our next issue of Bassline due out the end of next month. The deadline is quickly approaching the 15th of this month, so contact either Stephanie or me to reserve your space..Thank you everyone for the support!

you guys rock.

i'm grabbing it now, and will also mirror it for as long as anyone needs it.
my host is a little slower, but i don't have a bandwidth cap.

i also have the pre-3pm start, which i'm going to assume was their
"soundcheck" or whatever, so i'll encode that and up it for the
"completists" like me who want the whole damn thing.

gimme a few to get the main file and encode the other one.

Stay up Forever Collective – Hydraulix – Apex
Deck technician, production wizard and mainstay of the acid techno 
scene. Initially helping to kick start the London techno movement with 
the Liberator DJs, D.A.V.E’s focus has shifted from his earlier acidic 
productions to a darker style of techno which is reflected on his own 
labels HYDRAULIX and APEX.  When he rocks the house you’ll know why 
D.A.V.E. was recently voted into DJ Magazine’s world’s top 100 chart!

DJ MICRO – Long Island

local hero will be deputing his new CD,  “TECH MIX 5”, with an official 
kick-off party at BANG and you’re invited!

level!

participation in developing the New York City club scene in the early 
90’s.  Always a groundbreaking force in the ever-changing social 
movement, his new style is the wave of the future and we are excited to 
have the superstar at BANG!


MICHAEL MYERS - Philly
Local13 - 611records - M&M Studios - 02pro
Philadelphia’s first trance DJ, Michael has always gone the extra mile.

provide quality dance music to the masses. With flawless mixing skills

residencies in Seoul, Denver and Philadelphia. Be on the lookout for 
full production work from M&M Studios, stable to artists MacGyver,

Back in 1993 -- while his group Cypress Hill was enjoying universal

revolutionary Hardcore / Techno labels in the world. He was voted No 1 
'Hardest DJ' by Mixmag in 2004 & 'Best Worldwide Teckno DJ' by the

arsenal of headbanging beats to rip the sweat from every dancer there.  
His new CD "Hard As Hell" is merely a taste of the audio vengeance he 
will bring to this event.

EINSTEIN – NYC
ADAM WorldWide – AMPT - NATAS Productions - Mental Unity – La Corsa 
Nostra
Many remember Einstein as one of techno's earliest supporters or more 
recently percussionist of AMPT. When he steps up to the decks he takes 
his direction from the crowd - playing anything from minimal techno to 
the hardest hitting beats. Imagination and a reputation of mixing with 
the perfection of a scientist is what prompted early fans to coin him 
Einstein. If hard and groovy is what you like, come see the genius at 
work!

DJ SANZ ONE vs. THE MANNCHILD - NYC
Hardmind Productions – Terror Twins
DJ Sanz One & The Mannchild have grown into two of NYC's finest local 
hardcore heroes. When these two guys hit the decks you can always 
expect tight mixing coupled with an unparallel track selection. They 
have been devastating dance floors all over the northeast and they are 
showing no signs of slowing down. Tonight these two longtime friends 
will bring the pain with their first tag team battle in over a year!

C.O.A. - PA
D.F.T.C. - ADAM WorldWide - Hard Life Ent. - Forever Fam - La Corsa 
Nostra
His style combines the power and melody of nu-style hardcore, with 
elements of old school gabber. C.O.A means Center Of Attention because 
when this big dawg is behind the decks, whether you love him or hate 
him, you’ll always remember him. Standing 6 foot tall and 285 pounds

Subject: {pb-cle} Napster?

I have a co-worker interested in signing up to napster, but he's
having problems finding information on what format you actually get
the files in...

he wants to be able to sign up for a month or 2 and download a shitton
of music then cancel his subscription, but he was thinking that it
might remove or keep hidden those files after he unsubscribes.

anyone use it?  anyone actually pay for music downloads other than
itunes on here?

any software out there to rip out the napster files so that you can
save them permanently as mp3?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Napster?

The mp3 files have a security feature that has a lease type security.
After the given time amount you loose the ability to use the files.
There is a plug-in to winamp that will allow the bouncing of one of
these files to another new mp3 that does not contain the security
limitations.  This ability was brought up by Steve Jobs of Apple when
napster anounced this new service.  I'll look to see if I can find the
plug-in name.  At least with iTunes, the user has to buy the file and
then could share it, where as with this new napster mp3 leasing, the
loop-hole will allow people to rip files on a free trial basis with
nobody having paid.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Napster?

I was a little off, I forgot the mp3s don't have the security, its the
microsoft thing.  I guess you bounce the WMAs to a WAV first, then you
could make MP3s - from a web site:

Practical how to:
(credit goes to warlock1711 of club.cdfreaks.com for discovering this loophole)

0. Download and install Napster, sign up for 14 day free trial.

1. Download and install Winamp

2. Download and install the Winamp Plug-in Output Stacker

3. Open Winamp Options->Plug-ins->Output->Dietmar's Output Stacker->Configure
a. Add out_ds.dll from Winamp/Plug-ins folder
b. Add out_disk.dll from Winamp/Plug-ins folder
c. Select out_disk.dll in the Output Stacker->Configure
d. Set the output directory and output file mode to Force WAV file
e. Exit preferences

4. Load downloaded Napster protected WMAs into your Winamp playlist

5. Press play and each file will be converted to WAV as it plays

6. Burn WAVs to CD with your favorite burning program

- I accept no responsibility for the info above.  Just sending as an
illistration of the lack of foresight in security policies implimented
by Napster.

You saying that's a great lineup, then?  :-)

Same amount of $ could get you, you know, good music, and less new york asshats.

"I saw Marcus Intallex and smiled.  That was about it."

Honestly, I'm not sure if that was a sarcastic remark or not. I'm totally
agreeing with you as far as the line up for this event goes, I'm also
stating that my only draw would be Marcus Intalex.

You most likely wouldn't seem me there anyways.  =)

Oh, sorry about that.

The first (and almost last) DJ on that lineup that I'd really actually
want to see is MI.

That's fucking odd, because usually, I'm the drum 'n bass hater.  I
think most of what I hear now sounds really boring, and I avoid most
of the dnb parties around me.

Seeing a SUPER HUGE SHINY LINEUP where the main draw is a dnb guy I
haven't seen in years, that got a smile.

Subject: {pb-cle} [better than rave] DJ Entropy - Alone and Bad (mashup bizness)

I haven't made a track in just Acid in almost 5 years.  Lots of fun!  This
is Michael Jackson's "Bad" with Heart's "Alone".  I wanted to do something
with the Heart tune ever since Carrie Underwood did it on American Idol
*swooooon*.  hahaha

Anyway, enjoy.  I make make a re-edit with some more beatwork, or drop the
whole MJ beat in ReCycle and D:Rex and run everything through a whole lot
of howdy-doody, complete with arpeggiated melodies, syncopated rhythms,
and other things that take a lot of time and eat a lot of soul (and make
the DNB bois cum in their jeans), but it's quite good simple like this,
imo.

I'm not as elite as some of ya'll junglists, but theres a handful I really
do care to see off that lineup...possibly within Cleveland within the next
year for a few of 'em.  ;-)

Don't worry, I agree for the most part on the Mickey Finn's and Darren
J's...but you have to appreciate the magnitude of the event. It's consiered
possibly the biggest dnb party of the year.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Halo, last night!!!

I had a blast last Saturday as well. It was good to
see you too Lindsey. I really want to go to Columbus
this Friday to see Halo again, but I did the Friday
drive down to Columbus (to see Brett Johnson, He
ROCKED IT) and then drove back to Cleveland to see
Halo Saturday night. It would be the same thing all
over again, but this time with Miles Meada and Halo. I
REALLY want to, but my old, ass body is STILL hurting.
 I'm glad last week went so well and everything worked
out with the venue change, Thank Yebus!! Oh, try to
contact Jason Lyman on clevelandnightlife if you are
going down for the show. He's usually cool with guest
list action if you get there early!

Techno fest fee, future in city's hands

With creditors clamoring, event seeks $5 charge

April 13, 2005

BY BRIAN McCOLLUM
FREE PRESS POP MUSIC WRITER

Behind the public glow of Detroit's annual techno festival, a cloud of
money problems and mismanagement has grown uglier by the year -- and has
pushed the city's biggest annual music event to the brink of collapse.

Championed for years as a cultural landmark by civic leaders and fans
worldwide, the event's immediate fate now lies in the hands of the Detroit
City Council, which next week will consider an unprecedented plea from the
festival's latest organizers.

If producer Kevin Saunderson gets his way, the council will venture into
uncharted territory and allow him to charge admission next month at
city-owned Hart Plaza.

If the council votes no, Saunderson said his Fuse-In fest probably won't
happen. And for the first time since 1999, Memorial Day weekend techno --
along with its hundreds of thousands of fans -- would be absent from
Detroit's riverfront.

"If this doesn't pass," he said, "we start looking ahead to 2006."

Justified or not, Saunderson will be saddled with heavy baggage when he
and supporters, including mayoral aide Lucius Vassar, go before the
council. Despite massive public success, the free festival has been
plagued by near-fatal financial woes and organizational disarray.

In its two previous incarnations -- the Detroit Electronic Music Festival
(DEMF) and Movement -- producers have left a trail of jilted creditors and
burned bridges. Until last year, when organizers took the stage pleading
for donations, the issues have been largely invisible to audiences that
number in the hundreds of thousands each year.

Today, the scenario is more muddled than ever. Movement founder Derrick
May is out; former partner and fellow techno DJ Saunderson is in.

A slew of local contractors and small firms still await compensation from
Movements '03 and '04, staring with growing hopelessness at aging invoices
that in some cases top $30,000. After months of futile attempts to
collect, they've begun to speak out in frustration.

That's the dubious backdrop against which Saunderson and his team are
scrambling to stage Fuse-In, the latest incarnation of a tradition
launched in 2000.

It's also left a vexing question for local supporters: How could something
so good go so wrong?

Breaking with tradition

In his presentation to the council, Saunderson will cite a study by the
Detroit Metro Convention & Visitors Bureau, which stated that the 2002
DEMF drew 1.5 million visitors and put $94.8 million into the coffers of
area businesses.

"When it's bringing that kind of money into the city, there's no way this
thing should be in the red," Saunderson said.

He said his strongest council ally is Kenneth Cockrel Jr., who at 42 is
the council's youngest member and a longtime techno fan.

Cockrel, the council's president pro tem, said Tuesday he has not
discussed the festival issue with colleagues and would not venture a
prediction on whether the event will be allowed to charge admission. Like
other city officials, he said a principal concern is setting a risky
precedent at Hart Plaza, which hosts dozens of gatherings each year, all
free for patrons.

Allowing a private company to charge for access would require strict
guidelines, he said, because it would "break a tradition of free,
signature music events that goes back more than 20 years."

Cockrel said the council's decision would also be guided by logistical
issues: the fences, checkpoints and manpower needed to limit entry to
ticket-holders.

"You have to do it without bringing chaos to Hart Plaza and Jefferson
Avenue," he said.

Vassar, director of corporate and civic affairs for Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick
and Saunderson's chief city liaison, said Fuse-In's fee proposal is for
this year only.

A weekend of 300,000 attendees paying Fuse-In's proposed $5 entry fee
would bring in $1.5 million -- more than enough, Saunderson said, to cover
costs, pay previous contractors and leave seed money for the 2006 event.

While angry creditors finger May as the most culpable figure behind
Movement's debts, some say Saunderson also deserves blame. May took the
festival's reins in 2003; Saunderson came aboard three weeks before the
2004 event as registered agent for the newly formed Movement 2004 limited
liability corporation.

Saunderson said the partnership with May, a friend since their days at
Belleville High School in the early 1980s, left him responsible only for
expenses incurred by the new corporation. But he said he feels an ethical
obligation and would use funds from this year to resolve earlier debts.

He's also motivated by pragmatism: He knows his job would be easier if the
festival's reputation were clean.

"I'm all about uniting, and the festival should do that for fans and
businesses," he said. "My goal is to reestablish relationships and prove
that this is going to happen differently."

In September, Saunderson resigned from the Movement 2004 partnership and
submitted his own fest proposal to city officials, who gave the go-ahead
in February.

May would not talk about his soured business relationship with Saunderson
or discuss details about any legal liability that may still be held by his
former partner.

Saunderson said he has learned from previous producers' mistakes, but he's
also acutely aware that among the festival's backstage supporters -- the
vendors, sponsors and contractors who have helped and been hurt -- a dicey
reputation has taken root.

"Just say no to techno" is the going refrain at one firm involved with
several area events, including the past five techno fests.

In May's office near Eastern Market, where just a year ago dozens of
staffers bustled day and night, it's a starkly deserted scene, with a lone
part-time assistant fielding phone calls and the regular batch of mail
from lawyers representing disgruntled clients.

Among them are the Detroit area entrepreneurs -- many in their 20s and
devotees of the local music scene -- who had inked deals with Movement to
help promote, publicize and run the two festivals. Their services and
their bills were diverse: Sara Gozmanian, management consultant, $11,500;
Milad Elmir, Web designer, $25,000 plus commissions, and Chris Tennyson,
public relations professional, $35,718.

Their contributions varied, but their dilemma is the same one faced by at
least 10 other Movement contractors: They haven't been paid what they say
they're owed. And they've been navigating what many describe as a maze of
revolving corporate names and elusive communications.

"It's been a series of one promise broken after another," said Gozmanian,
who coordinated a Movement dinner party last year at the Fox Theatre.
"Derrick would explain the financial problems he was having. He'd tell me
he'd pay in three months. Then it would be, 'Give me another three
months.' I offered ideas. I proposed a monthly payment plan, which I
thought was reasonable. None of it came to be."

May said he intends to resolve all Movement debts. He has paid "hundreds
of thousands of dollars out of my own pocket," he said, prioritizing
payments to banks such as Wells Fargo, which helped finance the fest.

"Unfortunately, there are urgent bills that can't go unnoticed," May said.
"But everyone will be paid, and I am sorry for those who have had to wait.
These debts are very much real, and I take full responsibility."

Agent Richard Maher said May has spent most of the past year overseas,
where his performances continue to fetch premium fees.

"Every single cent that Derrick gets, outside his very basic day-to-day
living expenses, is going to his creditors," said Maher. "He's working
very hard to pay these people and to clear his name."

Gozmanian has chosen not to seek legal action against May or Movement
2004. The investment in court costs and attorney fees outweigh any likely
gain, she said, which is why she'll continue to pursue the matter on her
own -- even as she's begun to give up hope. Echoing others awaiting
payment, she said the biggest frustration has been a lack of response from
the Movement camp.

"The difficulty in actually making personal contact has been almost
impossible -- all the meetings that have been promised, all the e-mails
back and forth, with no action ever taken," she said. "It's turned into a
nightmare, like everything that involves the festival seems to do."

Big crowds, no profits

Two days before the start of Movement 2004, Detroit's prime party sat
stuck inside a row of semitrailers next to Hart Plaza. And it wasn't
budging.

With hordes of techno fans set to make the annual pilgrimage into the city
to immerse themselves in dance music and culture, the festival's nerve
center lay barren. Contractors refused to unload their stage rigs and
audio gear until payment was in hand -- money that Movement organizers
didn't have.

The next day, after pleas from city officials and a late private loan, the
trucks were unloaded. For the throngs of young folks who piled into the
plaza, including legions from out of state, the festival went off as
expected: three days of music on five stages, with fans dancing under the
Detroit skyline.

The DEMF's debut in 2000 had been a milestone for modern Detroit music,
the first prominent recognition of techno in the city where it was born.
Endorsed by civic leaders, it became a mammoth commercial and artistic
success, drawing crowds estimated at 1 million-plus and rave reviews.

But during its three years behind the DEMF, production company Pop Culture
Media spawned its own batch of jilted creditors and court judgments.
Despite firm president Carol Marvin's success scoring big sponsorships,
including Ford Motor Co. in 2001, the fest struggled to turn a profit.

May braced for a difficult climb when he was granted control of the
festival in early 2003. The City of Detroit had withdrawn its $338,000
cash contribution upon expiration of Marvin's contract, and May faced four
months and a floundering economy to solicit sponsorships, the festival's
fiscal lifeblood.

Things only got worse in 2004. Battles over corporate control among May
and his silent partners -- including Detroit businessman Raymond Owens and
attorney John Simpson -- consumed months that might have been devoted to
festival production. The resulting split led May to reincorporate,
ditching the Owens-controlled Derrick May Inc. and forming Transmat Events
LLC, with May's mother, Eleanor Tankersley, as registered agent.

Lacking cash and sponsors with just a month to go, May teamed up with
Saunderson and created the Movement 2004 corporation while securing a
high-interest loan from an unnamed private investor. That $75,000 cash
injection dried up quickly in the weeks before the festival, and crises
such as the unloaded trucks were confronted and negotiated on an
hour-by-hour basis.

"There were a lot of bad decisions made," said one insider close to the
Movement organization. "Derrick had a bad habit of not seeing problems
before they arrived."

Amid the lively scene at Hart Plaza last Memorial Day weekend -- a
colorful collage of hip young people and thumping techno beats -- the
organizational disarray began to seep from backstage and onto the festival
grounds. Midway through the festival, donation tubs sprung up across the
plaza; the most lucrative drew $76 over the course of a day. By the fest's
final day, May and Saunderson roamed the plaza concourse, signing
autographs for $5 contributions.

In a cramped office near the main stage, tensions ramped up as staffers
bickered among themselves and pleaded with contractors to keep the
festival's electrical supply running. A bleary-eyed May came and went --
his girlfriend was at a nearby hospital giving birth to their baby girl.
In moments of exhaustion, he told his staff that this was it. He couldn't
endure another bout in 2005.

"I didn't have to put my money, neck and reputation on the line," May
said. "I love this music and this city. But I don't want any pity. I chose
to do this. I rolled the dice, and this is where it ended up. It's been a
hell of a year for me."

Lack of business sense

Many creditors interviewed for this story were careful not to lob
accusations of bad faith. It wasn't ill will, they said, that created the
financial mess, but poor decisions and inexperience.

"Basically, these are guys who don't know what they're doing," said one
veteran contractor who is involved with several city festivals and asked
not to be named. "They're musicians trying to be businessmen and put on an
event. I believe Derrick took this on out of a genuine love and passion
for his music. He's just not an event planner."

Others, like Milad Elmir, aren't as charitable.

"You'll hear people say, 'Well, they're artists, not business people.' I
don't buy into that line of thought," he said. "An artist can still ...
conduct affairs the right way."

Elmir, who owns the Detroit Internet firm EXO, is among those whose anger
is tinged with a sense of betrayal. "We looked at it as a way to help a
good cause, a commitment to our city," he said. "I still support the
festival, but I can't support the individuals who have been involved in
it."

Elmir said he was approached by May to run the Movement Web site, eagerly
accepting a deal that called for a $25,000 payment and a cut of
merchandise sales. But jitters quickly set in.

"There was no business plan. They were winging it," he recalled. "If I'd
known that, I'd never have gotten involved."

Elmir said he has given up hope of an amicable resolution and by month's
end will be filing suit against May, Saunderson and the various entities
under which festival business has been conducted -- including Saunderson's
new Fuse-In corporation.

Chris Tennyson already made that move. In July 2004, he secured a judgment
in Wayne County District Court against Derrick May Inc. for $35,718 --
money owed to his publicity firm Seyferth, Spaudling, Tennyson for work at
the 2003 fest.

"We're very upset about how all this has happened," he said. "It shouldn't
be run like this. It doesn't have to work like this."

Decision time

What may have remained a quiet series of disputes has taken on heightened
importance as Saunderson prepares to face the City Council, pushing the
festival's finances from the private realm into the public sphere. Despite
his formal separation from May, many insist he retains responsibility for
Movement's finances as he charges ahead with Fuse-In plans.

"He doesn't have a clean slate. A clean slate would be getting everybody
paid and not hiding behind a new corporation," Elmir said. "What he's
asking is that the city give him this privilege when he's a documented
mismanager with a proven track record of helping screw this thing up."

Amid the growing animosity, the festival's defenders say it's vital that
the public grasps the bigger picture: Movement's money problems don't rest
in the hands of any single individual.

Derrick Ortencio, hired by May as Movement director, said the fest's
greatest obstacle was the city's withdrawal of funding -- an early blow
that created a domino effect of difficulties.

"There was tremendous pressure on the festival to deliver a comparable
product" to the DEMF "under totally different parameters," said Ortencio,
who left Detroit last summer for his native Toronto. "The financial
support just wasn't there. Does that make it OK if somebody doesn't get
paid? Absolutely not. But it's important to remember the root of where the
financial problems started."

City bureaucracy presented its own set of problems, said Maher, May's
agent. The 2002 arrival of the Kilpatrick administration brought
formidable shifts at City Hall, including wide budget cuts and changes in
the delegation of duties. "The ongoing political wrangling with the city
to reach a satisfactory agreement for the festival to go ahead, both
years, was the No. 1 factor against us," he said.

Jon Witz, producer of the annual Arts, Beats & Eats event in Pontiac, said
the techno festival has been dogged by unique problems, but said
sponsorship dollars are out there for the taking.

"Generally, where an event gets lost, especially if it's doing well from
the crowd and programming perspective -- which Movement was -- is due to
the organizers and municipalities," he said. "If there are problems
getting sponsors, that means there's some disconnect with the people who
would want to support it. ... It is possible to get it right, if not for
this year, then in 2006."

Still, it will take more hopeful rhetoric to soothe those such as Elmir,
who said $25,000 was a costly price for a lesson in the techno festival
business.

"When our elected officials keep giving contracts to these same people who
have handled things the way they've been handled, they're endangering the
festival," Elmir said. "This is a cautionary tale for anyone thinking
about getting involved."

             The Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Toronto Rave-0-Matic mkIV
                          Maintained by Trout Soup
                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

May 28-30                          FUSE-IN                          Detroit

deeeetroit like a muthafukka

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned
for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic 
Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am ::

In the late eighties Raida gained prominence as a member of the New 
York-based crew the X-Men who later became known as the X-ecutioners. 
Champions of furthering the turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made 
their reputation by utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the 
manual alteration between individual kick and snare sounds to create 
original drum patterns in real time. This practice has been an 
inspiration and a force in Roc Raida's style. His impressive finishes 
in some of the premier DJ battles; (first place in the 1991 "As One"; 
second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an 
episode of "Saturday Night Live"; (the first DJ to ever) has made him an 
american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hop’s 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such 
exotic locations as Singapore, Turkey, Japan and Australia. Roc Raida is 
considered among the best of the contemporary DJ's and has brought the

Subject: {pb-cle} bsp: blatant self pimping - new mix

just in time to make your tax day a little less suck-filled:
http://www.hypnotyza.com/radio/aprilfool

77 minutes. 70 artists. 40 tracks.
pop. hip hop. electro. house. techno. rock. you name it, it's in there.
could be the party mix of the decade.

DISCLAIMER:
this is NOT a live DJ mix - portions of it, yes, were mixed "by hand" but
not the whole thing. (man, do i wish...)
this project was edited and pieced together using acid, cool edit and some
super secret secret weapon stuff.

comments and feedback are welcome.

>Techno fest fee, future in city's hands
>
>With creditors clamoring, event seeks $5 charge
>
>April 13, 2005
>
>BY BRIAN McCOLLUM
>FREE PRESS POP MUSIC WRITER
>
>Behind the public glow of Detroit's annual techno festival, a cloud of
>money problems and mismanagement has grown uglier by the year -- and has
>pushed the city's biggest annual music event to the brink of collapse.
>
>Championed for years as a cultural landmark by civic leaders and fans
>worldwide, the event's immediate fate now lies in the hands of the Detroit
>City Council, which next week will consider an unprecedented plea from the
>festival's latest organizers.
>
>If producer Kevin Saunderson gets his way, the council will venture into
>uncharted territory and allow him to charge admission next month at
>city-owned Hart Plaza.
>
>If the council votes no, Saunderson said his Fuse-In fest probably won't
>happen. And for the first time since 1999, Memorial Day weekend techno --
>along with its hundreds of thousands of fans -- would be absent from
>Detroit's riverfront.
>
>"If this doesn't pass," he said, "we start looking ahead to 2006."
>
>Justified or not, Saunderson will be saddled with heavy baggage when he
>and supporters, including mayoral aide Lucius Vassar, go before the
>council. Despite massive public success, the free festival has been
>plagued by near-fatal financial woes and organizational disarray.
>
>In its two previous incarnations -- the Detroit Electronic Music Festival
>(DEMF) and Movement -- producers have left a trail of jilted creditors and
>burned bridges. Until last year, when organizers took the stage pleading
>for donations, the issues have been largely invisible to audiences that
>number in the hundreds of thousands each year.
>
>Today, the scenario is more muddled than ever. Movement founder Derrick
>May is out; former partner and fellow techno DJ Saunderson is in.
>
>A slew of local contractors and small firms still await compensation from
>Movements '03 and '04, staring with growing hopelessness at aging invoices
>that in some cases top $30,000. After months of futile attempts to
>collect, they've begun to speak out in frustration.
>
>That's the dubious backdrop against which Saunderson and his team are
>scrambling to stage Fuse-In, the latest incarnation of a tradition
>launched in 2000.
>
>It's also left a vexing question for local supporters: How could something
>so good go so wrong?
>
>Breaking with tradition
>
>In his presentation to the council, Saunderson will cite a study by the
>Detroit Metro Convention & Visitors Bureau, which stated that the 2002
>DEMF drew 1.5 million visitors and put $94.8 million into the coffers of
>area businesses.
>
>"When it's bringing that kind of money into the city, there's no way this
>thing should be in the red," Saunderson said.
>
>He said his strongest council ally is Kenneth Cockrel Jr., who at 42 is
>the council's youngest member and a longtime techno fan.
>
>Cockrel, the council's president pro tem, said Tuesday he has not
>discussed the festival issue with colleagues and would not venture a
>prediction on whether the event will be allowed to charge admission. Like
>other city officials, he said a principal concern is setting a risky
>precedent at Hart Plaza, which hosts dozens of gatherings each year, all
>free for patrons.
>
>Allowing a private company to charge for access would require strict
>guidelines, he said, because it would "break a tradition of free,
>signature music events that goes back more than 20 years."
>
>Cockrel said the council's decision would also be guided by logistical
>issues: the fences, checkpoints and manpower needed to limit entry to
>ticket-holders.
>
>"You have to do it without bringing chaos to Hart Plaza and Jefferson
>Avenue," he said.
>
>Vassar, director of corporate and civic affairs for Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick
>and Saunderson's chief city liaison, said Fuse-In's fee proposal is for
>this year only.
>
>A weekend of 300,000 attendees paying Fuse-In's proposed $5 entry fee
>would bring in $1.5 million -- more than enough, Saunderson said, to cover
>costs, pay previous contractors and leave seed money for the 2006 event.
>
>While angry creditors finger May as the most culpable figure behind
>Movement's debts, some say Saunderson also deserves blame. May took the
>festival's reins in 2003; Saunderson came aboard three weeks before the
>2004 event as registered agent for the newly formed Movement 2004 limited
>liability corporation.
>
>Saunderson said the partnership with May, a friend since their days at
>Belleville High School in the early 1980s, left him responsible only for
>expenses incurred by the new corporation. But he said he feels an ethical
>obligation and would use funds from this year to resolve earlier debts.
>
>He's also motivated by pragmatism: He knows his job would be easier if the
>festival's reputation were clean.
>
>"I'm all about uniting, and the festival should do that for fans and
>businesses," he said. "My goal is to reestablish relationships and prove
>that this is going to happen differently."
>
>In September, Saunderson resigned from the Movement 2004 partnership and
>submitted his own fest proposal to city officials, who gave the go-ahead
>in February.
>
>May would not talk about his soured business relationship with Saunderson
>or discuss details about any legal liability that may still be held by his
>former partner.
>
>Saunderson said he has learned from previous producers' mistakes, but he's
>also acutely aware that among the festival's backstage supporters -- the
>vendors, sponsors and contractors who have helped and been hurt -- a dicey
>reputation has taken root.
>
>"Just say no to techno" is the going refrain at one firm involved with
>several area events, including the past five techno fests.
>
>In May's office near Eastern Market, where just a year ago dozens of
>staffers bustled day and night, it's a starkly deserted scene, with a lone
>part-time assistant fielding phone calls and the regular batch of mail
>from lawyers representing disgruntled clients.
>
>Among them are the Detroit area entrepreneurs -- many in their 20s and
>devotees of the local music scene -- who had inked deals with Movement to
>help promote, publicize and run the two festivals. Their services and
>their bills were diverse: Sara Gozmanian, management consultant, $11,500;
>Milad Elmir, Web designer, $25,000 plus commissions, and Chris Tennyson,
>public relations professional, $35,718.
>
>Their contributions varied, but their dilemma is the same one faced by at
>least 10 other Movement contractors: They haven't been paid what they say
>they're owed. And they've been navigating what many describe as a maze of
>revolving corporate names and elusive communications.
>
>"It's been a series of one promise broken after another," said Gozmanian,
>who coordinated a Movement dinner party last year at the Fox Theatre.
>"Derrick would explain the financial problems he was having. He'd tell me
>he'd pay in three months. Then it would be, 'Give me another three
>months.' I offered ideas. I proposed a monthly payment plan, which I
>thought was reasonable. None of it came to be."
>
>May said he intends to resolve all Movement debts. He has paid "hundreds
>of thousands of dollars out of my own pocket," he said, prioritizing
>payments to banks such as Wells Fargo, which helped finance the fest.
>
>"Unfortunately, there are urgent bills that can't go unnoticed," May said.
>"But everyone will be paid, and I am sorry for those who have had to wait.
>These debts are very much real, and I take full responsibility."
>
>Agent Richard Maher said May has spent most of the past year overseas,
>where his performances continue to fetch premium fees.
>
>"Every single cent that Derrick gets, outside his very basic day-to-day
>living expenses, is going to his creditors," said Maher. "He's working
>very hard to pay these people and to clear his name."
>
>Gozmanian has chosen not to seek legal action against May or Movement
>2004. The investment in court costs and attorney fees outweigh any likely
>gain, she said, which is why she'll continue to pursue the matter on her
>own -- even as she's begun to give up hope. Echoing others awaiting
>payment, she said the biggest frustration has been a lack of response from
>the Movement camp.
>
>"The difficulty in actually making personal contact has been almost
>impossible -- all the meetings that have been promised, all the e-mails
>back and forth, with no action ever taken," she said. "It's turned into a
>nightmare, like everything that involves the festival seems to do."
>
>Big crowds, no profits
>
>Two days before the start of Movement 2004, Detroit's prime party sat
>stuck inside a row of semitrailers next to Hart Plaza. And it wasn't
>budging.
>
>With hordes of techno fans set to make the annual pilgrimage into the city
>to immerse themselves in dance music and culture, the festival's nerve
>center lay barren. Contractors refused to unload their stage rigs and
>audio gear until payment was in hand -- money that Movement organizers
>didn't have.
>
>The next day, after pleas from city officials and a late private loan, the
>trucks were unloaded. For the throngs of young folks who piled into the
>plaza, including legions from out of state, the festival went off as
>expected: three days of music on five stages, with fans dancing under the
>Detroit skyline.
>
>The DEMF's debut in 2000 had been a milestone for modern Detroit music,
>the first prominent recognition of techno in the city where it was born.
>Endorsed by civic leaders, it became a mammoth commercial and artistic
>success, drawing crowds estimated at 1 million-plus and rave reviews.
>
>But during its three years behind the DEMF, production company Pop Culture
>Media spawned its own batch of jilted creditors and court judgments.
>Despite firm president Carol Marvin's success scoring big sponsorships,
>including Ford Motor Co. in 2001, the fest struggled to turn a profit.
>
>May braced for a difficult climb when he was granted control of the
>festival in early 2003. The City of Detroit had withdrawn its $338,000
>cash contribution upon expiration of Marvin's contract, and May faced four
>months and a floundering economy to solicit sponsorships, the festival's
>fiscal lifeblood.
>
>Things only got worse in 2004. Battles over corporate control among May
>and his silent partners -- including Detroit businessman Raymond Owens and
>attorney John Simpson -- consumed months that might have been devoted to
>festival production. The resulting split led May to reincorporate,
>ditching the Owens-controlled Derrick May Inc. and forming Transmat Events
>LLC, with May's mother, Eleanor Tankersley, as registered agent.
>
>Lacking cash and sponsors with just a month to go, May teamed up with
>Saunderson and created the Movement 2004 corporation while securing a
>high-interest loan from an unnamed private investor. That $75,000 cash
>injection dried up quickly in the weeks before the festival, and crises
>such as the unloaded trucks were confronted and negotiated on an
>hour-by-hour basis.
>
>"There were a lot of bad decisions made," said one insider close to the
>Movement organization. "Derrick had a bad habit of not seeing problems
>before they arrived."
>
>Amid the lively scene at Hart Plaza last Memorial Day weekend -- a
>colorful collage of hip young people and thumping techno beats -- the
>organizational disarray began to seep from backstage and onto the festival
>grounds. Midway through the festival, donation tubs sprung up across the
>plaza; the most lucrative drew $76 over the course of a day. By the fest's
>final day, May and Saunderson roamed the plaza concourse, signing
>autographs for $5 contributions.
>
>In a cramped office near the main stage, tensions ramped up as staffers
>bickered among themselves and pleaded with contractors to keep the
>festival's electrical supply running. A bleary-eyed May came and went --
>his girlfriend was at a nearby hospital giving birth to their baby girl.
>In moments of exhaustion, he told his staff that this was it. He couldn't
>endure another bout in 2005.
>
>"I didn't have to put my money, neck and reputation on the line," May
>said. "I love this music and this city. But I don't want any pity. I chose
>to do this. I rolled the dice, and this is where it ended up. It's been a
>hell of a year for me."
>
>Lack of business sense
>
>Many creditors interviewed for this story were careful not to lob
>accusations of bad faith. It wasn't ill will, they said, that created the
>financial mess, but poor decisions and inexperience.
>
>"Basically, these are guys who don't know what they're doing," said one
>veteran contractor who is involved with several city festivals and asked
>not to be named. "They're musicians trying to be businessmen and put on an
>event. I believe Derrick took this on out of a genuine love and passion
>for his music. He's just not an event planner."
>
>Others, like Milad Elmir, aren't as charitable.
>
>"You'll hear people say, 'Well, they're artists, not business people.' I
>don't buy into that line of thought," he said. "An artist can still ...
>conduct affairs the right way."
>
>Elmir, who owns the Detroit Internet firm EXO, is among those whose anger
>is tinged with a sense of betrayal. "We looked at it as a way to help a
>good cause, a commitment to our city," he said. "I still support the
>festival, but I can't support the individuals who have been involved in
>it."
>
>Elmir said he was approached by May to run the Movement Web site, eagerly
>accepting a deal that called for a $25,000 payment and a cut of
>merchandise sales. But jitters quickly set in.
>
>"There was no business plan. They were winging it," he recalled. "If I'd
>known that, I'd never have gotten involved."
>
>Elmir said he has given up hope of an amicable resolution and by month's
>end will be filing suit against May, Saunderson and the various entities
>under which festival business has been conducted -- including Saunderson's
>new Fuse-In corporation.
>
>Chris Tennyson already made that move. In July 2004, he secured a judgment
>in Wayne County District Court against Derrick May Inc. for $35,718 --
>money owed to his publicity firm Seyferth, Spaudling, Tennyson for work at
>the 2003 fest.
>
>"We're very upset about how all this has happened," he said. "It shouldn't
>be run like this. It doesn't have to work like this."
>
>Decision time
>
>What may have remained a quiet series of disputes has taken on heightened
>importance as Saunderson prepares to face the City Council, pushing the
>festival's finances from the private realm into the public sphere. Despite
>his formal separation from May, many insist he retains responsibility for
>Movement's finances as he charges ahead with Fuse-In plans.
>
>"He doesn't have a clean slate. A clean slate would be getting everybody
>paid and not hiding behind a new corporation," Elmir said. "What he's
>asking is that the city give him this privilege when he's a documented
>mismanager with a proven track record of helping screw this thing up."
>
>Amid the growing animosity, the festival's defenders say it's vital that
>the public grasps the bigger picture: Movement's money problems don't rest
>in the hands of any single individual.
>
>Derrick Ortencio, hired by May as Movement director, said the fest's
>greatest obstacle was the city's withdrawal of funding -- an early blow
>that created a domino effect of difficulties.
>
>"There was tremendous pressure on the festival to deliver a comparable
>product" to the DEMF "under totally different parameters," said Ortencio,
>who left Detroit last summer for his native Toronto. "The financial
>support just wasn't there. Does that make it OK if somebody doesn't get
>paid? Absolutely not. But it's important to remember the root of where the
>financial problems started."
>
>City bureaucracy presented its own set of problems, said Maher, May's
>agent. The 2002 arrival of the Kilpatrick administration brought
>formidable shifts at City Hall, including wide budget cuts and changes in
>the delegation of duties. "The ongoing political wrangling with the city
>to reach a satisfactory agreement for the festival to go ahead, both
>years, was the No. 1 factor against us," he said.
>
>Jon Witz, producer of the annual Arts, Beats & Eats event in Pontiac, said
>the techno festival has been dogged by unique problems, but said
>sponsorship dollars are out there for the taking.
>
>"Generally, where an event gets lost, especially if it's doing well from
>the crowd and programming perspective -- which Movement was -- is due to
>the organizers and municipalities," he said. "If there are problems
>getting sponsors, that means there's some disconnect with the people who
>would want to support it. ... It is possible to get it right, if not for
>this year, then in 2006."
>
>Still, it will take more hopeful rhetoric to soothe those such as Elmir,
>who said $25,000 was a costly price for a lesson in the techno festival

>
>"When our elected officials keep giving contracts to these same people who

Subject: {pb-cle} Mubali interview by Ari D

Check out this Mubali interview by Goahead's Ari D. Both
Ari and Mubali will be performing at the Upcomming
Butterfly Dance Ritual - 4-30-05. This will be Mubali's
first Cleveland appearance.=20

Peace,

"I'll never look at clouds the same again"

This is Mubali's first "interview," and I'm convinced it won't be his
last.  This up-n-coming artist is fast becoming a force to recon with,
and we couldn't be more thrilled that it is so.  As Ghreg on Earth
recently demonstrated in New York, the San Francisco psytrance vibe is
defined by the combined virtues of purity and maturity.  What sets
Mubali apart; however, is his versatile, relentlessly heavy and down
right mad-trippy sound.  Known to venture between 142  and 150+ bpm
during his sets, Mubali just refuses to take prisoners.  The drive,
the intensity, the excitement of something totally fresh, it is all
there for the willing and able... are you ready for the intense
trance-dance experience?

ID3 is def. a remix of "Call Me" by DeeeLite

Which remix? Not exactly sure.

I swear I know #4, but can't think of it right now.

#5 is interesting...it samples the beat from BBD's remix of "Do Me
Baby"...I'd like to know what that is.

This was off another list and I thought you pukes up in Cleveland would like 
the thread.
Original post at bottom, a good read.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


Great read, and thanks for posting.

Although I agree with everything that is said,  I disagree with a lot.

Looking for groundbreaking music>?  Too bad.  Don't look too far, because 
unless we unearth some alien-brain-controling-technology (ie hypnosis, mind 
control) 
you aint gunna hear shit.

Its been done.  Its all been done.  All the sounds, chords, techniques, 
scales, samples
and re-re-remixes you can think of.  Everything musically has been done.  SO 
STOP LOOKING!  Every genre of music has been bastardized to its fullest.  

You cherish bands from the days of old?  No wonder, they set the standard for 
the genre before it was cliche.  So they get the golden cookie award.  Not to 
mention all the record sales, pussy and stock options.  Let them bask in 
their glory.

Why do all bands of today refer to the old school?  Its the only place to go.

I *now* have stopped looking for new music.  Im tired of it.  All makes and 
styles.
You will find me at the record store looking at the "oldies".  All genres.
These old classic tracks, whether it be rock, hip-hop, or techno, contain all 
the
standard solid elements that made the music what it is, definitive.

I prefer to hear the Juno hover in a rave cut.  I prefer to here the classic 
scaling in a Miles Davis album.   I prefer to hear "Mississippi Queen" ... if 
you know what I mean...
on a big system.

Let me elaborate.  Today, with techno, it is cliche for people shun the 
TB-303.
They prefer the *new* gear, they prefer the *new* hot softwarez.  Big deal.
What most don't understand, is the fact that although it was unintentional,
the TB-303 *is* techno.  It defines its genre.  Much like the 808 to hip-hop.
The Stratocaster to well....  you know.
This is why these old relics sell for much more that they are worth.

Why did this music break ground and sound soo g00d?  Maybe its due to the 
equipment used?  Mostly true analog gear from the days of old?  Does it have 
anything to do with the fact that most new "musicians" now work in warzed out 
software?  Reason?

Why do all musicians try to mimic this formula>?  It works.
Why do most prefer old school hip-hop with the speedup guitar riff with a 
simple drum track with rude lyrics on top?  (Public Enemy, NWA, RunDMC 
TribeCalledQuest and the list goes on)  Because it is what it is. Raw.  Down to the 
elements.

For good music, the sounds and techniques will always be the same.
Its just a matter for musicians to do their homework.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


A little off the path food for thought, this was taken from a blog, 
and though it doesn't bear directly on "dance" music per say, it 
does encompass it within it's "over view". In any regard, figured 
I'd toss this over for you all here to view and perhaps comment 
upon: 

Attack Of The Clones 

*MARCH MARCH MARCH* 

Can you hear that? 

*MARCH MARCH MARCH* 

It's the sound of marching clones. 


Industrial, a genre, that if one were to ask some of members of the 
genre's (arguably) founding group (Throbbing Gristle) began and died 
with Throbbing Gristle. But as with most labels, things tend to 
stick around as long as critics want to claim something exist, and 
so perhaps this is why there has been this element 
called "indsutrial" ever still, and for whatever reason, it has been 
within this beast called "industrial" that the most interesting of 
musical genres has been found (at least for me). 

The largest reasons behind this would lie in the amount of diversity 
found within the genre and working perhaps in tandem with this, the 
amount of innovation that sprouted from the genre. 
(for example, take Consilidated, Sheep On Drugs, Dead Voices On Air, 
Skinny Puppy, Ministry, and VNV Nation, and you have 6 really 
independently sounding things) 

Much like other musical genres of the "now" however, this once 
innovative juggernaut seems to have slowed it's pace. I believe this 
to be espically evident within the area often reffered to as "EBM" 
(Electronic Body Music). 

As stands, I look at much of industrial now, and it reminds me of 
just about every other musical genre out there.....that is in that I 
can't really tell the difference between one band to the next. 
Assemblage 23 might as well be VNV Nation as far as I'm concerned. 
That is, musically, you're basically dealing with things that are 
very formulaic. You can typically rest assured that you'll be 
greeted with one song after the next that is propelled by a 4/4 beat 
structure and timing, that you will be greeted with an entourage of 
analouge synth type bass lines and leads, that these bass lines and 
leads will be much along the lines that one may have experienced 
during the hey day of new wavish synth-pop and/or what is to be 
found in "progressive" house/trance. You can sit and rest assured 
that you'll have "depressive" lyrical topics full of goth poetic 
vigor. And on and on it goes..... 

This is perhaps a bit stranger than what one may find when dealing 
with what currently lies on the billboard top 40 in that well, if 
not the artist themselves, at least the bulk of the people that 
comprise the listening audience of this genre tend to be people that 
lay great claim to their "independent thinking", their embrace 
of "themselves" as opposed to their "conformic" embrace of a group. 
And yet, like the other more "mainstream" masses out there, you can 
still find that they tend dress in a similar attire (uniform), and 
propell the use of "tried and true" music formulas over the idea of 
musical exploration. 

So from drum n bass to industrial to "alternative" to metal 

*MARCH MARCH MARCH* 

THE CLONES MARCH ON. 

Many a record exec currently bashes on the problems (supposedly) 
caused by downloading music. I would liken this "supposed' problem 
to be nothing but an illusion however, as the fact of the matter is 
we've been dealing with essientially various forms of downloading 
for years. Today it's downloading, yesterday it was dubbing tapes 
for friends, and on and on it goes. Closer to point of fact, I would 
liken any kind of musical depression not so much to downloading, but 
to the fact that music as a whole has become rather boring. 

The "mainstream" has always stuck with a more conservative approach 
to music. That is to say, rather than propell new forms, it caters 
to forms that have already shown themselves capable of being 
commercially successful. 
So it's normally been within the more "underground" circuits that 
one would have to turn in order to actually find what was new and 
even to catch glimpses of what the mainstream would later be like. 
To a large degree, this is still how things work, what's interesting 
about todays "underground" however (specifically, within the United 
States) is that it's innovative efforts seem to have come to a 
crawl. 
Rather than issuing forth a barrage of artist that seem to carry 
an "arts for arts sake" approach, an approach that purposely 
attempts to go for raw emotional expressivness and/or artistic 
creation over emulation, like the "mainstream", it's been pumping 
out a rather large amount of artist who's main goal seems to be 
retintion of the "good ol days" through emulation of 
the "underground" artist that comprised the good ol days. I can not 
say that I understand why this is occurring. (i.e. take a look at 
the "Orlando" breaks area to see a darn fine example of this in 
action) 

I remember when I began learning guitar, I purposely strayed from 
even attempting to learn covers. Favorite artist of mine or not, I 
had no interest in learning how to play YOUR song. The philosophy 
was simple, my interest did not lie in being able to re-create what 
some one else had already created, but rather to see birth to my own 
creations. 

Don't get me wrong, everything has it's place. At times it takes an 
innovator to come up with an idea, to lay down the ground work for a 
new area(s) that may be covered. It then often takes emulators, 
people that decide to work within a forlayed framework, to begin 
seeing where this new framework may go. In deed, often times 
innovators quickly become emulators! That is to say, innovators of a 
style, rather than immediately seeking to push past what they just 
created, stay within the realm they have established/helped 
established and begin to see how far exactly they can push that 
realm. 

I'll give Skinny Puppy as an example......a group that helped 
innovate a musical form starting back in 84 and then remained 
steadfast within that realm until arguably 1994! As far as I'm 
concerned, it was not until Last Rights (Puppy's 92 album) or 
arguably The Eyes Of Stanley Pain (a Download album that hit in the 
mid 90s) that those that comprised Skinny Puppy finally began to 
work in an area other than that which they had helped coin back in 
84 with their original Back & Forth release. OVER 20 YEARS WITHIN 
THE SAME FRAMEWORK! 

Simarlarly, Ministry hit up Land of Rape in Honey circa 87-88, with 
the first 3 tracks of the album really coming to lay the foundation 
down (arguably) for industrial-metal. They continued to work within 
that framework all the way up to the current day! (Though I'll note 
since '92, they really haven't pushed the genre that much farther). 

And to that end, we have people like Front Line Assembly, who took 
the Puppy model, and then took the time to see where they could push 
that model to. 

And on and on it goes. 

So it is not that I am saying emulation is TOTALLY bad, but more so, 
that when in over abundance (which I currently think it is) it is. 
It's a lot like the value of the dollar in regard to economics, over 
flood the market with money, and you're going to have inflation; 
that is to say, a decrease in the value of the dollar. Over flood 
the music market with too much of the same thing, and you'll have a 
similar effect, things become stale and people won't appreciate it 
as much. 

So to those oh so scared about how downloading is taking away from 
the music industry, I say 
"FEAR NOT!" 
It's not the downloading where in your big problem lies, but the 
fact that you're attempting to sale stale and over produced product. 
You're dealing with depreciated value, not theft. 

Now, it's normally been the artist dedicated to art for arts sake 
that alleviate us of this problem. But, as forementioned, the 
numbers comprising such people seem to be dwindling......in there 
place, a rise of people all concerned with how well they can present 
a pre-existant formula. So we have a barrage of electro-clash 
artist, essientially re-doing what was done by new wave(synth-pop) 
in the early to mid 80s, jungle/drum n bass streamlining it's 
rhythmic presentation, sounds of bass, and even presentation (how 
many rewinds can you predict at a dnb event nowadays?), and on and 
on it goes. 

There's still artist propelling things forward, and actually, in 
pretty decent number (espicially when one starts looking outside the 
U.S.)......but that's besides the point..... 

'cmon people....who gives a fuck if it's not going to get you 
popularity.....I mean, it's supposed to be about "art" isn't it?

Looking for groundbreaking music>? Too bad. Don't look too far, because 
unless we unearth some alien-brain-controling-technology (ie hypnosis, mind 
control) 
you aint gunna hear shit.

Its been done. Its all been done. All the sounds, chords, techniques, 
scales, samples
and re-re-remixes you can think of. Everything musically has been done. SO 
STOP LOOKING! Every genre of music has been bastardized to its fullest. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah, every sound and technique has been done so we should "STOP LOOKING".  What a brilliant train of thought.

Subject: {pb-cle} the big 4/20

Was wondering if anyone knew what was going on for tomorrow in the  
Cleveland area. Usually there's "something" with it being 4/20 and all.

Just curious what everyone else was up to. =)

Enjoy the weather today..

Well this is interesting.  Either there is another DJ Scythian somewhere in the world, or theres someone who actually likes my music.  

If someone else has the same name, wow, thought I had that one on lockdown.  I mean, obviously I'm gonna have to hunt this guy down and beat him to a bloody tamponia style state.

It's to bad red liquorice is no longer an active member.  I would actually consider getting a membership just to send an e-mail to find out.  

It's a small world hyper-real, it's a small world.

Yeah, on a Thursday...

But! Kraftwerk is playing in Detroit on June 3rd and that is a Friday. 
Tickets are pricey though.

I just finished reading a book about Kraftwerk - "With love from
Dusseldorf".  Good read...

http://www.fluxeuropa.com/kraftwerk-books.htm

Has some tidbits...

For example, the album Radio-activity is not a reference to nuclear
radiation but about the radio.  Kraftwerk (at one point in time) viewed
themselves as a transmitter of music to the world.  Hence their first
website was a simple line drawing of a radio antenna.

The conclusion is kind of edgy...

Kraftwerk hasn't put out new material (beyond remixes) because they can't
top their previous material.  So in a sense if they put out something that
just wasn't quite an Autobahn or a Numbers then their legacy would end it
mediocrity.  But since they keep touring without new material they are
sort of like the Rolling Stones "playing one more tour."  The mystique now
has more value than their music. Caught between a rock and a hard place.

Interesting and controversial...

Also, some people may appreciate the fact that the Nightclub 9:30 is not a 
ClearChannel venue.

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

Sat Apr 23                       JOHN HOWARD                      Cleveland

Coming back to Wish Saturday April 23, 2005

John Howard (NEW YORK/SF, OM, All World)


For the second installment of the critically acclaimed SF Sessions 
Series from OM Records, John Howard delivers a set of absolutely kick 
ass house music. It.s on the loose and groovy, with jazzy percussion, a 
touch of vocals and tons of pure San Francisco flavor. The track listing 
includes the likes of Martin Solvieg, Bjorn Torske, Bob Sinclair, 
Underworld, Gabe Rene, among many others. Not to be missed.

Currently living in New York City, John is experiencing the spirit of 
the East Coast, enjoying a monthly residency at Shelter for OM. While 
producing and collaborating on various projects and efforts John has 
traveled all over the US, Canada, UK, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Russia and 
Brussels, Spain, Paris, and greater Europe.

John.s style is solid and smooth San Francisco mixing. Funk fused with a 
large dose of Chicago style reckless mixing and track selection, 
combined with his own brand of eclectic jazz funk and Bay Area radio 
influences from the late seventies and early Eighties. It.s always funky 
and it.s always different.

Featuring

Stacy Kidd & Dj Seven: 2 Hour 2x4 House Set
Chicago, IL 

WWW.DJSEVENCHICAGO.COM


Stacy Kidd was born in Chicago in 1972 and started DJing in 1987 after 
being amazed by the music he was hearing on the radio. He started out 
recording Chicago house mixes off the radio, and would try to mix them 
together with 2 tape decks. He would even try to mix them together on 
one radio with 2 tape players on it. After doing that for a year, Stacy 
began to have a good ear for the music and started to buy records.. but 
didn.t even own a turntable yet. It wasn.t until 1989 when he finally 
got a single turntable and started to mix with one turntable and one 
tape deck. Having mixed for a while without a pitch control on tape 
decks, using the turntable came naturally.

In 1990 Stacy was invited to play at a house party where he first used 
two turntables. There he met Paul Johnson who was a guest at the party. 
Stacy was playing a lot of unknown tracks he received from other 
producers like Ron Hardy, DJ Rush, Armando and Farley JM Funk. Paul also 
had some unknown material so they stared comparing tracks. Stacy would 
play one, then Paul would play one. This went on for hours. Soon after, 
they began to hang out and work on music together regularly.

In 1994 Stacy completed his first record with Paul on Dance Mania 
Records called "Stacy Kidd & Pilly P Doing Thangs Vol 1." They went on 
to do two more volumes before Stacy completed his first solo project 
called "15213 Loomis" on Dance Mania Records in 1996. Following Paul 
Johnson.s advise on musical styles, Stacy put out three club records

Rob Riddum, Cleveland . DnB/Turntablist

Rob Riddum is one of the most well known and dedicated Drum and Bass DJs 
in the Ohio scene today. The legacy began in 1996 as Riddum took his 
funky set to the streets as member of the popular Elements Squad. 

He has since cemented his reputation as a talented artist through his 
innovative, seamless mixing, dope track selection, and uniquely Riddum 
scratching technique. After taking a hiatus from the scene to focus on 
his studies at Kent State University, Riddum returns with a renewed 
determination to take the world of Drum and Bass to the next dimension.

When he's not out dropping his dope beats to live audiences across the 
Ohio and Pennsylvania scenes, you can find him in the studio pioneering 
the sounds of Drum and Bass as he is laying down his unique and powerful 
vibe in production of his own tracks.

Riddum recently produced the sound track and programmed individual 
tracks for MTV's Jackass and the "Steve-o, Don't Try This at Home Tour". 
"80's", an upbeat drum and bass track with a funky synth line, is slated 
for release early 2003.

Riddum is a talented, seasoned veteran of the scene and throws down an 
incredible set. His unmatched attention to detail and focus on the 
technical aspects of the art of DJing guarantees a seemless, spectacular 
performance that will leave the audience in awe and begging for more.

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned
for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic 
Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am ::

Champions of furthering the turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made

original drum patterns in real time. This practice has been an 
inspiration and a force in Roc Raida's style. His impressive finishes

second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an

american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hop’s 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such

The act JAIA is the project of  the French producer Yannis Kamarinos, 
formed in 1995 with Jean-Michel Blanchet and first oriented  Psy-Trance 
and Downtempo.  Since 2000 Yannis is working alone under JAIA name,  and 
today JAIA.s music is more orientated to Progressive House and 
Progressive Trance (and still Downtempo too).  JAIA has already released

ANTIX (Iboga Records . New Zealand) LIVE!
Based in Auckland New Zealand, Barton and Hayden Strom are the producers 
behind the project ANTIX.  The Strom brother.s dedication to pushing 
their style in new directions in the ever evolving Progressive Trance 
genre has made them one of the emerging acts to watch for in their 
scene.  Both Barton and Hayden were introduced to music at a young age 
listening, to music from their parent.s vast record collections.  They 
quickly became addicted to the hypnotic sounds of Trance in '95 when a 
friend handed them a tape urging them to check it out.  Barton instantly 
purchased a mixer and started DJ'ing at small parties in the growing 
Auckland scene.  Six months later he had moved to Japan to buy studio 
equipment and teach himself the art of production, and Hayden later 
joined him.  Together they returned to New Zealand, setting up various 
studios around Auckland and refining a sound, which really came together 
once they moved to the West Coast of the North Island and set up Slow 
Burn
 ing
Studios in '99.  The sound that seemed to evolve was a kind of minimal 
organic groove influenced by the European sound being played by DJ 
PHILIPP from Plastik Park and ANTI from Spiral Trax.  It wasn't long 
before a connection was made when Philipp toured Australia and New 
Zealand in 2000, and ANTIX were signed for their first 12", "Rainstick," 
on Plastik Park.  Over the years the two have managed to put a few of 
the "big ones" under their belts, playing the U-Site Fusion Festival in 
Germany, The Boom in Portugal, and The Rainbow Serpent in Australia.  
And now three years down the line, ANTIX completed their long awaited 
debut album "Lull" released on the Danish label Iboga Records.  The duo 
are currently touring the globe for the third year, they are only half 
way to completing this tour, but so far its been a huge success, playing 
parties in Denmark, Sweden, Croatia, Japan, the Voov Festival 2003 in 
Germany and then in London, where they played alongside other respected 
kiw
 i
artists for the annual New Zealand music night at club Fabric.  And now 
to continue the tour ANTIX will play in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Austria and then to finish in France.  On top 
of this they.ve also been involved in Auckland label Manta.  The label 
has just released its second 12" and third compilation "Subduction" 
featuring a excellent selection of New Zealand and international, 
Progressive/Psy-Trance which are all available from Cyberculture Records 
at (www.cyberculture.co.nz).  So at last...  Here comes the second full 
length album from ANTIX - "Twin Cost Discovery."  Since their first 
album - "Lull" - released on Iboga Records in June 2003, ANTIX had major 
success with their very groovy and unique style.  They have been playing 
their live set at a great number of events and have made a very good 
name for themselves in the scene.  Now two years later, Iboga Records is 
proud to be releasing another well produced album.  From start to end
  the
Strom brothers take you on a journey deep into their soundscapes.  You 
can truly tell that ANTIX has spent many hours making this album come 
true, and once again they surprise with their style, going in a new 
direction.

DEVIANT SPECIES (Ambivalent Records . London) LIVE!
DEVIANT SPECIES are the England based electronic duo who are currently 
touring Japan consisting of Santos De Castro and Paul Wright.  
Consistently releasing their unique take on the London Techno sound for 
the past five years, they are now preparing to release their third 
album, "In the Hands of the Randomiser," later this year on Ambivalent 
Records.  From the Warlock Studios comes the long-awaited album by 
DEVIANT SPECIES.  No need for introductions, once more you will be 
treated to nine quality-consistent cuts of dark and minimal psychedelia 
for the blackest hours of the night.  In this third album installment by 
DEVIANT SPECIES the band is now only made up of Santos De Castro with 
collaborations with ex-DEVIANT SPECIES member Paul Konrad Wright (now of 
N.R.S. fame) and ground-breaking producer Ady Connor from SCORB.  The 
atmosphere prevailing here is hard, with tinges of Industrial and 
Ambient intros and outros that cross-over giving the album a continuous 
flow.  It all ki
 cks off
with "Voice of Thard," a chugging and spatial number that builds up to a 
ripping chorus.  "Pincushion Man" continues with galloping intensity 
where "...Thard" left off moving relentlessly to a climatic final before 
"Shellless" ebbs in soothingly with an overture of peerless Gothic 
beauty.  The tight pulse is quickly restored leading to a frantic groove 
that allows you to breathe with its interspersed waves of noise.  On a 
slightly softer tip "Thermal Boundaries" follows with an infectious beat 
that gradually gathers momentum to trancing-out effect.  In a similar 
rolling yet relaxed vein enters "The Retinal Circus," which has been 
doing the bootleg rounds in an earlier unfinished version titled "The 
Abyss."  To follow, "In the Hands of the Randomiser" is the first 
collaboration between DEVIANT SPECIES and SCORB, a powerful track that 
starts with an Industrial soundscape and steamrolls forward into a 
roaring pay-off.  For the darkest hour "A Night to Dismember" brings the 
proce
 edings
to total mayhem before the forces of light emerge.  "Portal to Balojax" 
is a 3-minute-plus unwinding ambient piece and serves as a prologue to 
"The Entrapment of John Dory," the only morning track in the album and 
the second DEVIANT SPECIES vs. SCORB outing, a delicate cut destined to 
be a classic.

dont feel bad, i thought Goose was a pretty obscure name for someone
dumb enough to call themselves Goose... then i found out about the

speaking of... we need some good cookout house parties. lol

Sasha has no problem admitting he's big on using Live. Same goes for 
Digweed, Darren Price, Akufen, and Steve Stoll (BT too, but he's kinda a 
douche). This is a really suprising message from a record label that I 
see pirated material for about everywhere. These guys are douchebags for 
the way they present their message. OMGBBQ SO HARDCORE. Um, hey, 
hospital, you run a business and you're bitching like the RIAA. Two 
words: jungle trash.

On another note, I have to sit and watch this pay per view boxing event 
for work tonight (till 2am, bleh). I saw all these people waving Ohio 
flags and pointing to them then giving a little #1 sign with their free 
hand. I saw people wearing the Ohio state flag on as clothing and going 
nuts. I almost got a little patriotic for my home state myself until I 
realized it was the Puerto Rican flag. Doh.

Why doesn't Hospital Records just release CD Singles with their new 
material for the DJs who want to play CDs, Whats the difference $12 for 
two tracks on vinyl, or $9 for two tracks on CD.
Then there wouldn't be this talk of "if you can afford.." because if 
would be pricey either way.

Are there labels out there who are doing this?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

What a bunch of freaking wankers!=20
If these idiots weren't contradicting themselves and knew what they
were talking about I'd take them a little more seriously.
First off Sasha owns over 50k+ records I don't think there's a whole
lot of people that can rival with that figure. I bet his cds are a
very small fraction of that.
Secondly these big name djs don't even pay for their vinyls for the
most part ( quite possibly promos in the mail every day sometimes )
and if they do play cds most are ripped from their own vinyl ( I know
of a couple  big names that have done this by hand ). So in effect
does it matter?


Some big name dj plays CD's because they can but also because it's
practical. Don't go busting theirs balls about it.
The issue is not with the bigger djs but with the bedroom djs who are
playing illegite mp3s.

But yeah as we know it this is a never ending debate. Vinyl has it's
importance undoubtedly.

i think their point is about big name deejays who are no longer
supporting the vinyl market and yet get paid zillions of dollars
for something with an overhead of nearly nothing. CDRs are crazily
cheap these days.

Vinyl is going by the way side slowly but surely.  The dj is the next
thing to go.  By the time that happens this music is going to suck
just like hiphop does (Same thing happened there) Keeping vinyl alive
is to keep the music alive.

Btw, Weapons of Mass Creation 2 =3D tunes.  Support Hospital.  I bought
the vinyl version fuck cds.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

iPod nights at the local bars and clubs annoy the piss out of me. Now 
stanton and numark are putting out mixers with iPod cradles built in 
(recently announced at musikmesse). They allow you to cue better and 
crossfade basically.

Makes a whole lot of sense for a lot of places,  the dj's always show 
up, and they don't get annoying notes passed to them that say "KAN U 
PLAY SOME NOT TECHNO KTHX".

ive not heard of this. im assuming this means everyone brings
their own music with them, right? can people really be that
irritating?

half the fun of playing records is telling people that you dont
have any XXXXX that they ask for. i always tell them ill play
something way better for them instead. and then i play whatever
record i was about to play anyway.

I think I took it out once, almost two years ago.  Huge waste of
money.  I do want to some cd joints to play some unsigned things and
my own stuff.  As much as I love vinyl, dub plates are a huge waste of
money too.

Yeah, I've wanted to record all my records to vinyl, but that's so time 
consuming, and I only have like 60-70 records I think.  Although I guess 
there's a good program that will record them and also get rid of the 
surface noise.  btw, tip for those that want to do it...  Saw a special 
on the smithsonian archiving records and they use distilled water on a 
q-tip and place it a few grooves before the needle to help sorta clean 
and lubricate the groove and it's supposed to get rid of practically all 
surface noise.  Although I think just using a spray bottle of rubbing 
alcohol would be less tedious if you don't care too much about a little 
bit of surface noise.

Subject: {pb-cle} some movies i have influenced...

asians crossed the landbridge to be eskimos, migrated south to be
native american indians....as more whites came from the east,
more indians were slaughtered and pushed further and further west.
in the far west, mexicans decided to call a city los angeles, city of
the angels...when the chinese arrived when started building the
chinese transcontinental railroad from the west to the east, they
introduced america to the chinese theatre.  this of course soon got
americanized, but it was a place where all your dreams could come
true.  and all the hollywood stars were soon memorialized with actual
stars in front of the chinese theatre. today the city is called Hollywood.

from that early asian influence, came quite a few movies that have
been influenced by myself and asians before me...

CROUCHING TIGER,  HIDDEN DRAGON -  cinemagraphic epic
portrayal of chinese theatre and martial arts brought to the big screen.
beautiful costumes, beautiful landscapes,  beautiful moves, beautiful
romance,  this li'l hidden number has got it all and a fine example of
how china was way ahead of it's time in action, adventure, and
romance in theatre.

EMPIRE OF THE SUN -  one of stephen spielberg's earliest featuring
christian bale when he was a boy, set in mainland china when
japan was invading during WW2.  christian's character is put in
a concentration camp until flying tigers and american air force
come to save the day...christian still has to witness the dropping
of the a-bomb on japan though.

CHINATOWN - one of jack nicholson's earliest movies...he plays
detective, charlie chan styles to try to figure out the secret lives of
the upper class near chinatown through their power struggles and
secret liasons.

ALMOST FAMOUS - cameron crowe movie - william miller, a high school
newspaper writer is hired by rolling stone to do a piece on a band on
the road, despite his mom's reluctance, he goes, and he parties with
the best of them...he even hooks up with a young kate hudson...i was
the editor in chief of my high school newspaper - the shadow at
rootstown high school...i was also infamous for trying to get kids to go
to alternative concerts at blossom music center in cleveland where
bands like: depeche mode, new order, and lollapalooza was at...it was
actually china girl (the girl who od'ed on heroin and came back to life at
interstellar outback one) that i interviewed for my zine PLRM eventually
ended up working for Rolling Stone magazine.

OLD SCHOOL UNRATED AND OUT OF CONTROL -  obviously influenced
by my fraternity days at CWRU in ZBT, zionist fraternity...the frat from
which william gaines (mad magazine), samuel goldwyn (mgm), charles
gordon (field of dreams), robert klein (actor), harold ramis (animal house),
samuel rosen (20th century fox), andy trentacosta (playboy channel),
and jack warner (warner brothers) were fraternity brothers at...for
others check: http://bama.ua.edu/~zbt/famous_alumni_of_zbt.htm

PECKER - early eddie furlong (terminator) movie by john divine
"pecker" (furlong) goes snap happy with his camera through
the interesting aspects of family life in baltimore...helps when
mom's a stripper...i was notorious for snapping pics when i took
my photography classes at CWRU...baltimore was the destination
for the ULTRAWORLD parties when i used to make bus trips
out to there from Cleveland for the CWRU Rave Team, i started in
1992.

KIDS - harmony corwins indie movie cult classic about kids growing
up in new york...skater styles, sex, raves, drugs, and std's all at too
early of an age...i also made bus trips out to new york, specifically
long island for the CAFFEINE Parties for the CWRU Rave Team.

REQUIEM FOR A DREAM -  darren aronofsky's movie about the seedier
side of new york city life...Sara Goldfarb is a lonely, TV obsessed widow,
Harry is her son, Marion his girlfriend , and Tyrone his drug dealer friend .
After learning that she will make an appearance on a TV game show,
Sara tries to lose weight so that she can fit into her prized red dress, and
becomes hooked on diet pills. Meanwhile, Harry and his friends are taking
heroin and cocaine. We then witness the disasterous consequences and
the downward spiral their lives take as a result of their addictions...this
movie clearly reminded me of when i met garred martin, rachael gardner,
and jinx when i first moved down to columbus, ohio from cleveland, ohio...
the three of course were synonymous with excess drug use at the time.

YOU GOT SERVED -  battle of the west coast b-boys...nuff said...this movie
was obviously when i used to hang out with rec shop / ill style b-boy cru
in columbus, headed by breaker dan and his twin brother shawn, from
upstate new york, who ended up moving to beverly hills, california.

THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS - rob cohen and gary scott thompson's
flashy high speed movie about west coast street racing with all the
flare and gangster styles...the movie that truly put paul walker and
vin diesel out there...when i got my all black mitsubishi eclipse
w/ tinted windows and 6 disk pionner cd changer in the back, i
thought it was too souped up, i actually removed the tinted
headlight covers...in addition, i never raced it and the custom image
where i worked at was actually a home improvement company.

SAVE THE LAST DANCE - julia styles picks up her styles from some
black kids at an underground club...actually i'm asian and not black
and it was amy funkybizz that i took to the underground clubs in
columbus and cleveland and akron...ironically amy funkybizz does
look a bit like julia styles.

RUN LOLA RUN -  Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), a small time courier
for big time gangster, he is working a standard pick-up/drop-off,
and everything is going just fine. When the job is done, all he
has to do is wait for his girlfriend, the orange-haired punk girl Lola
(Franka Potente), to pick him up. But today is unlike any other day.
Due to an incident while she was buying a pack of cigarettes, Lola
is late, and Lola is never late. One stroke of bad luck leads to
another, and by the time Manni calls Lola, he is at a pay phone with
a big, big, big problem. His unforgiving boss will meet him in twenty
minutes to pick up 100,000 marks; money that Manni, suddenly,
does not have. Lola rushes out of her apartment and down the
street, attempting to get to Manni and, somehow, pick up 100,000
marks on the way. She tears through the city, in a whirl of bums,
nuns, babies and guns. Down sidewalks, into offices, through traffic
and back again. As her feet slap the pavement and the seconds tick
down, the tiniest choices become life altering (or ending) decisions,
and the fine line between fate and fortune begins to blur....this
movie is a depiction of layla's hectic life when she was dealing drugs
and commiting other organized crimes with garred martin, one of
ohio's worst gangsters - the one who had framed me to be yoshi.

BASIC INSTINCT - verhoeven's classic club suspense thriller, like
Chinatown, the movie is based in san francisco...michael douglas
plays the private dick investigating a series of mysterious murders
that leads him to sharon stone, who turns out to be one of the
sexiest evil geniuses to ever hit the big screen...obviously anyone
who has read the investigative watch logs of my conversations
with layla know exactly the similarities with this movie and my real
life...everyone wonders do we love each other or whether she
wants to kill me

THE MATRIX - Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a computer worker who
discovers that the world around him is a computer simulation called
the Matrix. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), teaches him that the
Matrix uses humans as batteries. Morpheus has been searching his
entire life for a "chosen one" to help him pull humans out of the
Matrix.  He believes Neo is the one. Neo has his doubts, but with
the love of Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss), Neo starts to see.  Unfortunately,
Agent Smiths dont want Neo to achieve his true destiny...Actually,
this movie came about when I worked at Qwest Communications,
a long distance phone service company...Jinx, who was on a lot of
drugs at the time thought I was being turned into an agent, he
and layla wanted me to stay underground and out of the matrix
aka the system...Oracle was actually the software program I had
given to Republican Mayor Lashutka during Pre-Y2K...Of course,
now all of america has learned that computers are very necessary
and if you pull the plug, then entire power grids can go out, airports
dont work, and yes, even nuclear power plants can experience
slight fall-out since computers regulate the temperature of the rods.

FAHRENHEIT 9/11 -  Michael Moore's infamous documentary about
our politicians and how they avoided any real investigations behind
9/11 and the consequences of soldiers who had been misled into
the war on iraq...Without question, everyone pretty much knows
that I was the one that truly pursued the investigation behind 9/11
and have sent several critical investigation reports to the FBI with
very little response, including the architectural aspect of the 9/11
investigation (since i have a degree in architecture from CWRU) and
the insider trading aspect of the 9/11 investigation (since i worked
most of my life as an account executive)...but rather than pursueing
the obvious leads i had set forth (that the terrorists shown on TV
were actually arabs being framed to justify two unnecessary wars),
i was framed to be yoshi when #1 the WTC was designed by a
japanese architect #2 there is no Yoshi on any FBI most wanted
list #3 i was being framed by dark tares who were responsible
for all the terrorism.

AGENT CODY BANKS - Cody Bank, typical teen has a secret--he's
actually CIA. Cody's living every boy's dream life--he can drive like
a stuntman, has an incredible arsenal of cool gadgets, and his
agency mentor, Ronica Miles, is totally hot. But Cody's training is
put to the test when he's sent to pose as a prep school student
and befriend fellow teen Natalie Connors in order to gain access
to her father--a scientist unknowingly developing a fleet of deadly
nanobots for the evil organization ERIS...obviously this movie was
put out to make me appear i'm just a teenager and a joke agent.

THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - of course after i revealed too much,
this movie was put out to silence me (the lamb of God), and to
portray me as a crazy homicidal maniac...ironically, i was being
framed by the woman i had previously investigated, a former
evil seductress turned into an investigator to silence me with
ridiculous accusations.

THE HULK - ang lee's (crouching tiger, hidden dragon) fantastic
computer digitized version of the green giant comic book hero
- the incredible hulk...obviously this movie was put out to portray
me as "the wrath of God".

BRUCE ALMIGHTY - Bruce is a down on his luck TV news reporter.
In a fit of desperation he challenges God and vents that if only he
had God's power, he could solve all his problems. God responds
to his challenge and allows Bruce to take on his powers to prove
himself. Bruce soon learns that being God is very challenging...
another cover up movie depicting me as a former news reporter
somehow given holy miracle powers to solve world problems
but playing God is harder than it seems

LOST IN TRANSLATION - Bill Murray plays a down and out actor
who gets another break in Japan doing liquor commercials...
this movie was put out when i made my trip to japan and china,
the trip was actually a mission to re-initiate a $500 billion world
trade deal america previously had with Japan and China.  It
was actually arnold schwarzenegger who was the actor and
had done cheesy drink commercials there before.

SPIDERMAN - a whimp gets bit by a radioactive spider to become
crime fighting spider man.  he also has a hot girlfriend - mary jane
...instead of slinging web, i sling web sites...and everyone knows
about my love for mary watts now.

PAYCHECK -  john woo movie starring ben affleck as Jennings, an
engineer who has had part of his memory erased, struggles to
find clues to his whereabouts for the past two years. Turns out his
employer did the evil deed as a security measure, leaving him only
with a collection of random objects to help him reconstruct his past
...the reality is that japan and china has bought hundreds of billions
of US treasury bonds to get America out of its $500 billion budget
defecit and give it its current $388 billion budget...TOTAL RECALL
is when Federal Agents realize that their pay checks had actually
been coming from asians!

MEN IN BLACK - In present-day America, Tommy Lee Jones plays
Agent K, a member of an organization that has been keeping track
of extra-terrestrial aliens on Earth for over 40 years. When K finds
himself in need of a new partner, a brash NYPD detective, James
Edwards (Will Smith) fills the position, becoming Agent J. Armed with
space-age technology (which J barely understands) and their razor-
sharp wits, J and K investigate a newcomer (played by Vincent
D'Onofrio) who is bad news for Earth...tommy lee, who just happened
to be al gore's roommate when he was in college joins forces with
will smith (house party fame), an actor who had been cast to play
walt smith (collective intelligence, another party kid from cleveland,
ohio that i helped start) parts before...Democrats and the CIA had
always been suspect of alien technology ever since my post about
Area 51 and Hanger 18, located at Wright Patterson Air Force in
Dayton, Ohio - also the home of Alien Workshop skater gear...The
constellation orion is actually what the lay out of the egyptian
pyramids form, it also where the pleidians are from aka the Family
of Light, the good aliens as opposed to the evil grays.

ROMEO MUST DIE - In this modern day Romeo and Juliet, kung fu
action star Jet Li plays Romeo to hip-hop singer, Aaliyah Haughton's
Juliet. Li is an ex-cop investigating the murder of his brother, who
had ties with the Chinese mafia in America. Aaliyah plays the
daughter of the American mob boss. Neither side approves of their
romance, so, obviously, kung fu action ensues, with a soundtrack by
Aaliyah...obviously i represent modern day romeo and layla modern
day juliet...i call layla a nazi and she is obsessed with her "dont be
like jews", "keep the jews whipped" brainwashing...hopefully, this
love story will not have a tragic ending

MINORITY REPORT - Based on a Philip K. Dick short story, Minority
Report is about a cop in the future working in a division of the police
department that arrests killers before they commit the crimes courtesy
of some future viewing technology. Cruise's character has the tables
turned on him when he is accused of a future crime and must find out
what brought it about and stop it before it can happen...obviously
i had been doing some law enforcement investigations when i find
out that i had been framed for the murder of layla and end up
being the one investigated...so i send watch logs proving that she
is still alive to the other agencies

THE ONE-  in the near future, a technology called "quantum tunneling"
will allow human beings to travel between parallel universes. The abuse
of this ability by criminal elements has led to the formation of the Multi-
Verse Authorities or "MVA," an agency of quantum traveling cops who
apprehend violators of inter-dimensional laws...this movie was used to
explain my odd ability to communicate with people in various motion
pictures in real time despite the fact that film is pre-recorded material
and even inspire new movies in real time

THE NEGOTIATOR - In the midst of an elaborate conspiracy, an expert
negotiator is driven to the edge when he's framed for the murder of his
partner, as well as embezzling money from his department's pension fund.
His only chance to prove his innocence is to take hostages himself, acquire
the services of another expert negotiator, and find out who's running the
conspiracy before it's too late...another movie depicting how i had been
framed to have murdered layla as well as embezzling money from the
FBI and CIA (double agent), when in reality my pay checks have been
held back due to the frame job, eventhough i had been sending in
intelligence reports since 1998...apparently some of my e-mails had
been intercepted and made into movies...i am still awaiting my royalties
for the movies that i had inspired as well.

MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE - Captain Bennett Marco (Washington) and
Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Schreiber) served together during the Persian Gulf
War (the first one), and were part of a platoon of U.S. soldiers who were
kidnapped by the enemy, and brainwashed to become pawns once they
return home. Now, ten years later, Raymond Shaw is climbing the political
ladder, as his mother's (Streep) new husband is a powerful senator
helping a presidential candidate. Marco, however, is not dealing with the
adjustment after the war as well, and eventually remembers being
brainwashed. Knowing that it's just a matter of time before Shaw is called
to service by his handler, Marco contacts Shaw to try to get through to
him before something terrible happens...obviously washington plays
john muhammed, who was brainwashed to commit the baltimore sniper
shootings...of course, i am the real manchurian candidate, i have the
ability to head this nation, but i am being brainwashed to be an immigrant
gang member because i am not white.

PI - darren aronofsky's movie about a genius who locks himself up in his
apartment spends hours in front of computers to find the mathematical
significance of god' real name...eventually the realization overwhelms him,
and he ends up picking a hole in his head to forget and befriends a little
girl.
...unable to physically lead the nation because i am not white, i am
confined to my room, solving world problems on my computer, sending
my intelligence reports from california to DC, hoping the reports do not
get intercepted by the nazi's who have alterior motives - war plans to
conquer the world...a li'l mormon girl sent to investigate me has learned
the truth and has become my distant friend.

THE OMEGA CODE - Ancient codes hidden within the Torah reveals the
secrets of global events, past (i.e. Hitler, the Kennedy assasination, the
Gulf War), present, and future. One man (York) is after the Code, seeking
the power to change the world as we know it...for the worse. Another
(Van Dien) seeks the truth, risking his life and everything he stands for in
order to stop him...i was the one who posted about the bible code since
2000...i just recently posted the bible code warning that there may be
major earthquakes coming up in california and to prepare for things by
training a natural disaster division of homeland security

BEAUTIFUL MIND - A biopic of the meteoric rise of John Forbes Nash Jr.,
a math prodigy able to solve problems that baffled the greatest of minds.
And how he overcame years of suffering through schizophrenia to win the
Nobel Prize...the movie that they made that scientists all around the
world have learned about my intelligence reports despite the nazi's
trying to frame me as a schizophrenic and have unnoficially awarded
me the noble prize

SECRET WINDOW - Mort Rainey (Depp), a writer just coming off of a
troublesome divorce with his ex-wife, Amy (Bello), finds himself stalked
at his remote lake house by a psychotic stranger (Turturro) who claims
Mort stole his best story idea (changing just the ending)... (Hutton plays
Bello's new boyfriend; Dutton plays a private investigator hired to make
Turturro's character leave Mort alone.)...hollywood screen writers
message that they do not believe they had plagiarized their stories
from me, because they do not want to pay me royalties

BIG - A young boy makes a wish at a fairground machine to be big.
He wakes up the following morning to find that his wish has been
granted and his body has grown older over night. But he is still the
same 12 year old kid on the inside. Now he must learn how to cope
with the unfamiliar world of grown ups including getting a job, and
having his first romantic encounter with a woman. What will he find
out about this strange world?...movie to get people to become born
again virgins, forget their past, because you can't change the past,
and start a new life by seeking a new job and romance

FORREST GUMP - The story follows the life of low I.Q. Forrest Gump
(Tom Hanks) and his meeting with the love of his life Jenny. The film
chronicles his accidental experiences with some of the most important
people and events in America from the late 1950's through the 1970's
including a meeting with Elvis Presley, JFK, Lyndon Johnson, Richard
Nixon, fighting in Vietnam, etc. The problem is, he's too stupid to realize
the significance of his actions. Forrest becomes representative of the
baby boomer generation having walked through life blindly...obviously
i have had a tremendous influence in modern day events even events
in the past, despite the fact that most people see me as inept forest
gump character that accidentally effects major events, movies, and
tv shows.

SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE - Sam is a recent widower who is seeking
someone new.  Sam's son Jonah, is also looking for a new mother,
so when Jonah puts his father on national radio, hundreds of women
write to him. One of the women is Annie. She's engaged to Walter,
but he's a bit strange. Annie goes to great lengths to meet Sam....
this movie perfectly depicts my long distance relationship with
layla and mary...jonah is symbolism for three days in  the belly
of the whale

YOU GOT MAIL - The owner of a large bookstore chain starts putting
the owner of a small local bookstore out of business. Meanwhile they
have been corresponding over the internet without knowing who either
of them are.  They can't stand each other in person but over the
internet they are very attracted. He finds out who she is but she
doesn't know. He starts to like her more but she still hates him. He
has to fix it....obviously another movie perfectly depicting my internet
relationship with layla...we couldn't stand each other when we lived
together before...i start to love her more over the internet, but she
still hates me, so i like all the world problems i had to deal with before,
have to solve the most complex problem known to mankind since
adam and eve - women, you can't live with them, you can't live without
them

THE GIRL OF YOUR DREAMS -  Post-Franco filmmaker Fernando Trueba's
first Spanish-based feature since 1993's Oscar-winning Belle Epoque, La
Nina de Tus Ojos begins in 1938, when Spain is torn by Civil War. As a
sign of cordiality between General Franco and Adolph Hitler, a Spanish film
crew is invited to Nazi Germany's UFA Studios in Berlin to make two versions
of a popular Andalusian musical. The cast includes sexy, golden-hearted
Macarena (Penélope Cruz), director Blas Fontiveros (Antonio Resines),
leading man Julian Torralba (Jorge Sanz), art director Castillo (Santiago
Segura) and alcoholic Rosa Rosales (Rosa Maria Sarda). On arrival, they
gape at the resplendent shooting facilities, thankful to escape the misery
of their war-torn country. However, it is not long before they realize what
they have got themselves into, particularly when Nazi propaganda minister
Josef Goebbels (Johannes Silberschneider) falls for the Latina charms of
Macarena. German actress of Fassbinder fame Hanna Schygulla makes a
cameo appearance as the wizened wife of the lustful propaganda minister
...ironically i had wanted to cast penelope cruz for my lady guadelupe
movie idea, to give mexican americans a better image than as immigrants
and gangsters...the movie also correlates to republican gov. arnold's
relationship with his wife maria shriver kennedy, who comes from a strong
democratic family...cruz bustamante is also california's lieutenant governor,
who also happens to be democrat.

FIFTH ELEMENT - Two hundred and fifty years in the future, life as we know
it is threatened by the arrival of Evil. Only the fifth element (played by
Milla Jovovich) can stop the Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to
do every
five thousand years. She is helped by ex-soldier, current-cab-driver, Corben
Dallas (played by Bruce Willis), who is, in turn, helped by Prince/Arsenio
clone, Ruby Rhod. Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg (Gary
Oldman), who seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his
alien
mercenaries...when i was in columbus, i was often percieved as a cab driver,
giving rachael rides...after arriving to calfornia and solving so many world
problems and assisting with the cyber-division of homeland security, i am
given
a travel bonus - for four people to anywhere in america including hawaii and
the bahamas...my mother doesn't get it and constantly nags me...all of a
sudden jinx is back as the irritating pain in the ass commentator through out
my ordeal...apparently something evil coming toward earth and i need to find
the perfect woman so that our love can be the fifth element to stop the evil
before it hits earth.

THX1138 - George Lucas adapted this, his first film, from a short he
made at University. THX 1138, LUH 3417, and SEN 5241 attempt to
escape from a futuristic society located beneath the surface of the
Earth. The society has outlawed sex, with drugs used to control the
people. THX 1138 stops taking the drugs, and gets LUH 3417 pregnant.
They are both thrown in jail where they meet SEN 5241 and start to
plan their escape...the first has become the last...as i am actually one
of the closest bloodlines to adam, i have become the last adam...i am
considered 'underground' because i'm no longer in the matrix...the
mormons have chastened me by spreading false rumors of 'gang rape'
about me...i have stopped taking drugs for some time now...somehow
as if by immaculate conception, i have gotten my soulmate pregnant...
our isolation from the rest of society through the use of deceptive nazi
propagnda seems like a modern prison within our own homes...and we
must find a way to escape, so we can be together again.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

<<<<<<
Why doesn't Hospital Records just release CD Singles with their new
material for the DJs who want to play CDs, Whats the difference $12 for
two tracks on vinyl, or $9 for two tracks on CD.
Then there wouldn't be this talk of "if you can afford.." because if
would be pricey either way.
>>>>>
CD Singles are no longer an option in the industry.  There are very few 
labels left releasing them, and fact of the matter is that 90% of the people 
(who are not playing original or "loaned" materials) are playing pirated 
material.  Hospital, as well as a few other labels, released umixed versions 
of the cds.  Of course that doesn't have any remixes.  There are quite a few 
people who do buy the cd's and play them in addition to the stuff they 
download, but on the whole it doesn't make sense to manufacture em.  From a 
consumer perspective American labels were always late in releasing them, and 
from a dj perspective no one is going to know if you own it or not.


<<<
Vinyl is going by the way side slowly but surely.  The dj is the next
thing to go.  By the time that happens this music is going to suck
just like hiphop does (Same thing happened there) Keeping vinyl alive
is to keep the music alive.>>>>

Glad to hear someone else say that the next logical thing to go is the dj 
itself.  To people who say "you can't fight technology" I've been saying 
that for a while now.  For most mainstream music I'm guessing the end result 
of digital media will be a copy-protected format that will be eventually 
introduced and become the standard.  (Are the tracks you can legally 
download from itunes in mp3 format, or do they use something proprietary? 
.acc or something? )  While there will always be ways around that for the 
tech-savvy -- the record labels will bide their time and go back to charging 
the same or higher prices once everything is locked back down.   In the 
meantime, underground dance music continues to loose its identity because 
what little money that was fueling the dance music industry relied heavily 
of the sale of its music to DJS.  In the past the music pond was so small 
that quality music could rise to the top and easily be found.  In this day 
and age where everyone thinks they are the next major talented producer --  
the quality that does rise to the top of the massive flood gets lost and and 
has little chance of getting noticed.

I think in the end most everyone will end up paying the price... and at 
who's expense?   The current model has forced talented producers to find 
other ways to make money besides concentrating efforts on making music.  A 
producer MUST now dj (perform) just to survive if he is to make a career out 
of it -- unless of course he is rich and has bought his way to the top.  I 
think everything was better when djs were djs and producers stayed in the 
studio.  Just because you can make good music, doesn't mean you know how to 
play other peoples music to entertain a crowd.  The role of a DJ has gone 
from someone whose job it was to please and entertain the crowd to someone 
who simply puts on his little "dj concert" and often (not always) lacks the 
experience and knowledge of how to entertain people and move them forward. 
A producer is going to know how best to present his own music, but has 
little idea of how to push a scene bigger than himself.  The fact that the 
masses are now trained to think a relevant dj must be a producer is sad. 
The music that once unified people has now only torn them apart in genre 
wars.

I wonder who makes money in the industry in this day and age? I bet country 
music is at the top, because their target audience isn't as tech savvy. 
What genre of music has paid the ultimate price?  Dance music.   It's 
audience is the most tech savvy out there.   It is so funny.  If you notice 
no one argues any more that "I paid for that" because in a digital world 
there is ABSOLUTELY no way to tell if they are being honest.  Nothing 
physical at all.   So you likely have ONE honest person out of 20.  In every 
other industry the tools of the trade cost money, and at the end of the day 
the only thing that sets a dedicated person apart from a wannabe (with 
dreams of reaching fast rockstar status) are those tools.   Sure there are 
those who "play records for the love it" and don't ever want paid.  That's 
not a bad thing... I can see an argument here for paying for music when you 
can get it for free and its just a hobby (cop out).  HOWEVER... if you 
intend on making a dime your a hypocrite if your not paying for it.  If you 
want to argue that point... fuck you and have a nice day.  I think that if 
you want to support the artist and buy it digitally and still "buck the 
system" then maybe I can kinda still see your point.  HOWEVER... if you want 
to further this music and once again make it relevant in the eyes of the 
rest of the world... then you need to feed a system that will help take it 
there.  If you think that the general public can make up their own minds... 
your a sucker.. because someone who has the money will come along and do it 
for them.

Regarding the footage specifically.  I think the image that those guys paint 
is pretty accurate. How are they wankers?  Because they speak their mind? 
Maybe if you want to get on the hate campaign you can call them out on petty 
points.  If you really think what they were saying was "don't ever play cds" 
you obviously missed the point.  I think what they were saying is that "if 
it is available on vinyl then as a producer you have a responsibility to 
play it on vinyl". I think it is also pretty evident that they are saying, 
as successful people, that "If you are getting paid phat money to dj, then 
you have the means to press your own dubplates."  Maybe they were implying 
that if you aren't playing vinyl you don't really care enough about the 
music to show everyone else you believe in it and support it.  Perhaps, if 
your not playing vinyl, you are helping to illustrate just how disposable it 
has become.  Like I said... no one knows if it is pirated or not... and if 
you can't proudly say "I paid for it" then one can only asssume you must be 
stealing it (unless you are obviously playing original material) -- because 
the majorty DO.  If you are getting $1,000 a gig three times a week you 
afford to spin vinyl and if you really care you can afford your own 
dubplates and you can even pay someone to carry your records for you.

I think in the Frankie Knuckles example, they are illustrating those who 
stopped making money on producing music and turned bitter and realized that 
they make their money from djing and not from selling music. In the "techno" 
era of the late 90's all these producers started making a LOT of money... 
and they could get away with putting out rubbish and sticking their name on 
it.   "Paul Oakenfold presents" or whatever.  When the market stopped paying 
for rubbish --- those people got PISSED.   "Fuck it -- I can stilll get paid 
phat money to do a dj concert."  Half of them are jaded and don't want to 
see anyone else have a chance up.   They don't have a need to see people 
buying music as long as they will spend money their money on "dj concerts" 
instead.  In fact, in order to keep making money they need to do everyting 
in their power to make sure no one else can knock them off.

You get pissed over the way they painted sasha and james zabiela?  Damn. 
That shit was FUNNY and spot on accurate.  From every "mimic" they made to 
their end of the day assessment... You want to be pissed for them saying 
"When you pose for photo shoots its with a nice big bag of records -- why 
aren't you being what you are and pose with your little dainty cd wallet". 
Come on... think about it.  You pay $30-40 to attend these little dj 
concerts when you should be able to go out to a club every weekend and get 
the same experience for comparative pennies.  Maybe I'm living in the past 
and this is an antiquated idea but isn't playing other people's records 
exactly what a dj does?  I think that if a producer is going to put on a 
show he damn well better be doing it live.


<<<
Btw, Weapons of Mass Creation 2 = tunes.  Support Hospital.  I bought
the vinyl version fuck cds.
>>>>

In the past two months I have the most enjoyment of music I have gotten is 
listening to the nu:tone cd on Hospital -- along with other similar stuff. 
While they are probably too light and fluffy for self proclaimed "heads" --  
I can't think of anything I've heard that is as relevant to today as what 
they are currently putting out.  If you don't like... I respect that... but 
Hospital records have outsold any other UK label 2or3 to 1 in the past year. 
In my eyes they are TOTALLY successful in what they do... and to have seen 
that video clip this week really hit home because the past two weeks all I 
could think was "these are some of the very few guys out there that are 
doing things totally right".

not that i know of? at least not in that general time period,
maybe they did something else pre "drum and bass". there were
records out on that label from like 96 or so according to discogs,
i never heard any of them till "songs in the key of knife" in the
summer of 98. id really like to see what those cats were up to in
96 though, if anyone has mp3s....

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

i have london electricity -diirty dozen/pull the plug promo from late
97....id say its jazzy jump-up...think adam f-brand new funk or the first
few records on pivitol...its a cool record for that era, definately better
than the SS jazz and bass stuff...but the structuring on it is
wierd....usually u expect stuff to happen every 32 bars or so....on this one
stuff happens in sorta random spots...making it hard to lock up a good beat
mix.

i wish hospitol wouldve stayed on that path to be honest...a good bit of
there stuff post-2000 is boring to me...the first weapons of mass creation
is what i use to fall asleep when im fighting the insomnia.

its ludacris for anyone to be expected to cut enough dubs to go on
tour...think about it...if u keep 50-60 records in your box for a tour...and
30-40 of them are dubs...thats alot of money wasted at $40-50 a
plate...WHICH ONLY GET ABOUT 30 PLAYS BEFORE THEY SOUND LIKE ASS...so your
dropping 2grand on records which will only last for the tour...and you might
make 10 grand touring...so 1/5th of your money is spent on something that
wont last...thats why everyone big is going to cds...they stuff they get
wont see vinyl for probably 4-5 months at minium...and if your only income
is djing/producing...you are taking a pretty big hit...especially when there
are bills to pay....like rent, auto, insurance, taxes, electricity, water,
etc...it used to be that the labels paid for the plates...but they arent
doing that anymore, cuz the labels have bills to pay too...the cd issue
really comes down to if u are using them right...using a cd player right
means playing your tracks and tracks your other producer friends give
you...using a cd player wrong is going on slsk and copping everything you
can, just so you dont have to buy vinyl.

you gotta look at it this way too...the whole point of dubplates was to have
a way to test a tune out on a live audience...whats the difference if the
same tune which may never see the light of day is cut or burned? either way
the dj is gonna know if the tune will work, and will let the producer know
what has to be done to make it work, or if it should just be scrapped.

You don't see the hypocracy in a cddj getting together a record bag just for 
a press photo?  Your usually the first one to call something like this out. 
Now your rolling your eyes?

Just because there are sites are up there serving it, doesn't mean that they 
are succesful.  Beatport has been up like what, not even a year?  I heard of 
a lot of those uk sites who jumped on it before america started to follow 
suite are folding now.  The guys I've talked to who run successful labels 
who also offer digital did so to recoup the losses they saw from piracy. 
They say they are very disappointed with it.  But of course a new generation 
of people who never had success in the first place say otherwise.


Nick... I don't disagree with you about the dubplate thing.  I think what 
they said was to make people in those positions actually think a little more 
about what they are doing.

I don't know how you can say that, they have put out mabey one chill
tune in the last year (move on by seba and paradox) and the path that
they are on is the same one that london electricity started out on in
the 90's, very much dance floor oriented and very musical.

The only thing I have on mp3 from 96 is nhs02 - The Perter Nice Trio.=20

that came out after "songs in the key of knife". discogs says
october 98 and that sounds about right to me because i got that
one too. i got most of their stuff around that time and that
definitely wasnt out late 97, even on promo.

i know this might seem like common sense (lord knows these not
much of that in dnb) but if they made music that was STILL GOOD
after it came out on vinyl, maybe they could play it on vinyl and
not have to always play dub heavy sets? really talking about this
in relation to dnb is a joke because the music is a joke. the idea
of putting out a record then not playing it anymore is silly. and
they wonder why they cant move units of vinyl? ha. suckers.
hospital is one label that might actually have to worry since they
do put out a good bit of timeless music. 

>you gotta look at it this way too...the whole point of dubplates
was to have
>a way to test a tune out on a live audience...

how much "testing" is actually done via dubplate? i mean, do tunes
really need tested by every big deejay for 6-12 months? i guess
they all fail since none of them end up being played after theyre
released.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

all those tracks sound the same to me mang....re-programmed amen 
drums...some flighty sound...maybe a flute or guitar on the 
buildup...synthetic sounds can be just as musical as samples of real 
instruments...all in who's programming the music...either you know your 
scales and chord progressions or you dont...just cuz something has a sample 
of a "real" instrument in it doesnt nessicarily make it musical to me.

just my 2cents...i will freely admit, i dont know the hospitol catalog very 
well...but most of what ive heard lately just hasnt been my cuppa...and like 
i said...most of their stuff will literally put me to sleep.

i bought that dirty dozen record from spectra...which labeled their units by 
when they came in...the date on the promo is 12.97...it could be mis-labeled 
who knows...it has a white label....so there is no copywrite date.

What specific press photos are you blabbing about? Please, post a 
link. The only DJ I know to publicly swear off vinyl as his 
primary medium is Sasha, and every press photo I've seen of him in 
the last six months has been of him using the custom controller 
built for Ableton in the booth at Crobar New York. I think he only 
uses CDs if necessary to upload sound sample libraries and tracks 
as they are mixed through Ableton and the MIDI controller. 
However, I do believe he also will play vinyl if he's doing a set 
with Digweed where he is not exclusively the featured artist.

With regard to CDs leading down the path of eliminating the DJ, 
think again. It makes the DJs role as critic, shaman, and filter 
all the more important. As the market gets flooded with more and 
more producers who can publish straight to market without the 
overhead costs of retail, distributors, and pressing, there is 
more and more material for DJs to dig through to find the gems. 
DJs are needed more and more to dig, filter, and present only what 
he or she believes to be the best. Now THAT's a value-add role!

The DJ as broker of quality becomes key. The DJ as true tastemaker 
to the masses is critical. Anyone can buy a Top 10 chart at 
BeatPort for ten bucks. But who's taking the time to dig for the 
gold? Which DJs have the balls to include dope music in their sets 
that will separate the boys from the men, REGARDLESS of format it 
was sold to them in? If a DJ is limiting him or herself to a 
particular format, whether it be vinyl-only or CD-only, chances 
are, some great music is going to be missed on both sides. Why not 
open up to possibility and just look at dope music as dope music?

This also still a key role for labels. While some sites allow 
independent artists to publish music for sale, the site still 
juries the quality. Many do not let Joe Y post his basement 
dabbling online for sale. Most download sites require a 
contractual agreement from both artists and labels just as any 
distributor would from any label. If the label isn't selling, it 
gets the boot.

As a label in Toes in the Sand, we will continue to distribute 
both vinyl and digital in an effort to reach the broadest audience 
as possible. We realize that there are those who prefer to play 
vinyl and who can continue to afford to purchase it. However, we 
also realize that there are a number of people who cannot afford 
to pay a $13 USD import price or a $7 domestic price, and give 
them the opportunity to purchase a high-quality FLAC file for $3 
USD or less. Digital sales ARE a good way to combat piracy. Many 
people who are not DJs and who seek digital formats are genuinely 
honest and are willing to pay a couple bucks for a format they can 
listen to on their computers or rip to a CD to listen to in their 
car. You want to talk about expanding the listening audience of 
music? Who pops a 12" in their car player to rock out to on the 
way to work??

The fact is that digital has broader accessibility for DJs, 
producers, and audiences alike. Unless a piece of music is being 
composed and recorded on all-analog equipment, it touches the 
digital world. Much dance music is created, mastered, arranged, 
recorded digitally... Reason, Cubase, Digital Audio Tape, to .WAV 
format, to FLAC ... whatever the case ... that vinyl record you're 
touching most likely has been in digital format at some point in 
its life before it is pressed. Even Hospital Guy was sitting in 
front of a computer in his studio.

When Hospital Guy #2 mocks Sasha for downloading 6 new tracks 
before the gig, that track may be coming straight out of the 
mastering studio, not some illegal download site. WHY would guys 
who play several gigs a week WAIT for a track to be pressed to 
vinyl after it has been mastered, when they can have a mastered 
version out of the producer's studio in minutes? Why, why, why?

In all this bitching and holding onto tradition, I haven't seen 
one good reason why digital is not a viable alternative, yet I can 
think of at least reasons why it is:

DIGITAL
- cost (production, distribution, retail)
- portability
- timing to market
- sampling (looping, on-the-fly remixing using new players)
- less interference from turntable/needle static

VINYL
- It looks cool in press photos
- We always did it that way

Now, don't get me wrong...I would hate to see vinyl go away 
completely. It is definitely a part of the culture. But from 
personal experience, the benefits of digital far outweigh the 
nostalgia of holding onto it for holding onto it's sake.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

To each his own blah blah blah but if it wasn't for Hospital, Calibre,
and the like I don't know I would still be spinning dnb.  I almost
quit buying records in 03 because everything was getting samey and
clowny the the liquid crew came through and I picked the habit back
up.   Nowaday I'm down to buying just a few heavy producers (Calyx,
Noisia, Chris SU and SKC, Teebee, Dom and Roland) but even thier stuff
is getting samey now.  I can barely tell the difference from song to
song but not like it matters you can pretty much mix any song with any
song, there no art to mixing it.  Seriously how many ways can you
process a saw wave?

I dunno, what are you feelin these days? =20

This was my original reply to the list which had bounced.

I believe people should evaluate the new digital sales sites below 
to get a balanced perspective.

And something else that I think needs to be pointed out with 
regard to comparing guys at the level of Sasha or James Zabiela to 
Joe Average ...

If your argument is that people need to play vinyl is that it is 
some sort of "receipt" and proof that they've paid for the music; 
people who play occasionally are typically also the people who 
cannot afford to pay $13 or more for a record! Shouldn't the scene 
be more egalitarian that people should be able to play regardless 
of what they can afford to buy?

If you think for a minute that guys at Sasha or Zabiela's level 
even have to shop for records anymore, you need to understand that 
they get so much music sent to them for FREE by labels and 
producers just hoping to get "Discovered" or charted, that the 
question of them supporting the scene through their purchases is 
moot or very very small in comparison to what they're given 
gratis.

We alone get more demos sent to us every week that we can't even 
keep up with reactions and Dave can't even get them all played out 
even with a weekly, and we're a very very small indie label -- the 
amount those guys must get sent to them has to be staggering. I 
knew a guy that did screening of free material for Tenaglia, and 
he was even thinking of getting an intern to help out there was so 
much stuff....

...We also get referrals by big names "Hey, I think this is a fit, 
take a listen...." the bigger guys look out for the producers to 
get the stuff signed...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

I definitely don't think the argument was at all about Sasha or James
Zabiela "buying" music.  The hospital folks were whining about how
important vinyl is to record labels and why they think people like
Sasha etc are being wankers by not playing vinyl any more.

They weren't comparing Sasha to Joe Average, rather, they were saying
that the top of the top, if they are not using vinyl, then what does
that say, and what's going to follow with Joe Average.. if everyone
starts playing CDs and MP3s, that's gonna be it for most record
labels.  Because I guarantee you there are enough DJs out there with
no scruples that only buy vinyl records because they can't afford to
buy the technology to steal the music yet, and because there is still
a gray-area type stigma about those technologies.

If you start pricing CDJ 1000s at the same price of a "numark starter
kit" watch what happens to vinyl sales and music sales in general in
the underground scene.

I agree with most of your points in a previous message, about the DJ
as a filter, but lets look at reality, how many DJs are there left
that trot the globe on "selection skill" alone without having serious
production credit, own a popular label, or have huge media hype
machines behind them?   I don't care what anyone else says, but
production is where it's at, and the incentive to produce isn't going
to be there much for most people if people can't think that down the
road there's at least a hint of a possibility of getting compensated
in some way for serious time and money spent on it.

No one cares what the medium is that the music is on.  And it's not 1970.

the compensation should be that you made good music. if you need
more than that you shouldnt be making music in the first place.

The most exciting stuff that I'm hearing these days is in the breakcore, raggacore, toxic dancehall, drill n bass, UK grime & glitch house genres. Props to pb-cle peeps like Cutups, Xanopticon, Ninemillimeter & the Mad Dem Sound crew (who, by the way are holding it the fuck down on ragga-jungle.com), DD New Mole, Greg Trash & Chris Decay... my point overall is that a lot of this stuff is so new and truly underground w/ no vinyls of it being pressed, that it's neccesary to play it out digitally just so people can hear what they're not going to 99% of the time at dance clubs and events... lots of purists don't immediately respond to something that's generally unfamilar, but you gotta start somewhere...

are you crazy?!?!?!?!?! so someone isnt dedicated enough to put in
the time and effort to do the job necessary to be a real deejay.
we should just let them DL everything for free and play off CDJs?
are you fucking kidding me? they should be taken out and shot.
there are people who bust their ass to be the best deejays they
can be who dont get enough gigs. give those paying gigs to those
guys instead of some joker with no dedication.

thats not what its about. its about leading by example. you own a
label, you should be playing records only. no fucking question. if
you dont, there better be no whining about piracy since you cant
even be bothered to buy and play the records, why should anyone else?

those people arent pressing their stuff on vinyl because not
enough people will buy it because its not really that good.
xanopticon has tons of vinyl releases out. if these people really
believed in their music theyd press it on wax. there are plenty of
people out there busting their asses to make good music and put it
out in the best format possible, vinyl. those people need monetary
support. which is why you should

BUY VINYL

I agree with you 1000% in principle. But that's not the only incentive
in the game... record labels need to make money to sustain themselves,
and it's people who are not purists and who aren't completely
principled that manage to sustain the whole thing. It's the tens of
thousands of shitty records that sell and make money for distributors
and labels that support the infrastructure that makes small labels and
good music thrive.  Otherwise people like your boy Theo would
literally only be pressing whites for him and his boys, like he has
done, but then you'd never ever get a chance at owning any of his
music.

I'm not babbling about press photos they are.  You seemed to have missed 
that point.

Babbling, like you are one to talk.  I won't bother reading any of the rest 
just as you didn't bother trying to read or understand what I said.

Like I don't know the dj is the filter... that's assumed when I said 
initially that DJS SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON PLAYING MUSIC and PRODUCERS SHOULD 
PRODUCE.  Maybe people would stop going to DJ CONCERTS to stand around and 
watch, and actully go out to dance.

i have connection for all those detroit records now, man ;) 

but seriously, i know this cat in the UK who has released some
harder techno material on various labels but who is now getting
into dirty detroit styled house and even some loopy disco edits.
his stuff is real nice, but he's no longer concerned with making
money from it. so he's going to be pressing up 100 whites of his
tunes and giving them away to his friends. he knows whats up.

Exactly! (Same holds true for other genres, also.)

The other side of the digital coin is internet radio. Stations 
like www.ProtonRadio.com have broken so many amazing new producers 
that would have never been paid attention to were it not for that 
site, or if they were, would have been made to jump through 
insurmountable hoops to get the music they produce out there (like 
getting signed to be pressed to vinyl FIRST). Digital breaks down 
barriers for many talented people, especially young kids like 
Derek Howell or Christopher Lobsinger who aren't even old enough 
to get into 18+ parties, but whose production and musical ability 
are developed beyond their ages.

and all im saying is that in chicago alone teenagers in the 80s
could sell THOUSANDS of units of 12" singles of minimal bedroom
produced house music because it was excellent stuff. i know times
change but good music still sells.

As a Drum n' Bass newb, I can honestly say that Hospital records is probably 
one of the few labels that even got me interested in the genre in the first 
place... and the DJ's who bought Hospital records of course...

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

me personally....im feeling nosia, pacific, phace, calayx, dom,tebee, chris 
su, skc, some of the bad company stuff,digital, njc, spirit,most of the 
armada stuff thats forthcoming, skynet and alot of the underground bedroom 
producers on the dsci4 fourm...since we got picked up by kinematic...the 
flood gates of austrailia have opened too....i got so much new stuff in the 
last 2 weeks its crazy....probably 100 new fresh legal tunes...probably 70 
of them are un-signed, but should be.

im pretty much in neurofunk mode right now...but i still like the heavy 
dubwise stuff, and im always down for a good amen smasher...i agree that 
that alot of it is samey...but everything has its own certain funk to 
it...thats what im listening for...yeah...alot of ppl are using hella 
processed reeses and mentasms...but if the musical programming is good...ie 
the basslines and progressions...im usually down for it...you can say that 
any two producers from a certain sub-genre sounds the same...ie...u can say 
nosia and phace sound the same....i could counter and say that calibre and 
high contrast consistantly sound the same...so its all a matter of taste.

my problem with most liquid stuff is the bass just isnt there like i like 
it...if it doesnt make the bottom of my nut sac tingle, im probably not 
gonna like it...unless there is something really clever about the 
track...the only liquid producer that consantly does it for me is 
digital....but i wouldnt even pigeonhole him as a straight liquid 
producer..hes all over...but when i buy a liquid tune its usually from him 
or spirit..and sometimes MIST....from all the good stuff i heard about the 
nu:tone album...i really wanted to like it...i played most of it outa jes's 
box a few days ago...i just wasnt feeling it...none of the tracks really 
grabbed me as anything special...i guess felt the same way about that as you 
feel about alot of the harder stuff...it just seemed like all the tracks 
followed the liquid "formula"

in the end...everyone perfers different things...id still rather hear weak 
liquid tracks than shitty industry rap or industry metal thats for sure.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

im doing both...dont let anyone tell you otherwise...my dnb is definately 
getting more techy...espcially as i learn how to program better acid...but i 
will never quit doing the dnb thing...more than anything else dnb is what 
moves me in dance music...personally i dont like spinning techno, id rather 
make it live on machines...if im djing id say a good 95% of the time, im 
gonna play dnb...especially if its tech'd out...most the dnb im feeling 
anymore is basically 175bpm broken beat techno anyways aka neurofunk.

Yes.....

Hey, if you're getting handed down tunes and your not some type flight DJ  
like the rest of them are.. would you play them tunes on disc?.. Cause I  
know I fucking do.. unless it's all ready released.. then I'll buy it.

But then again, I dont go wasting a whole set playing cd's either.

Um.

Vinyl = 1940s - 1970s
CDs = 1990 - present


I didn't know a hunk of plastic with some grooves on it was "art".

Look into it.  Its definitely an artform.  

I don't know how  " America's #1 Hardcore DJ/producer " can make such a claim
when he doesn't even support the scene he is supposed to be in.
The only way a dj or producer CAN support "the underground rave scene" is to 
press and buy wax from a local record store or distributor.
Plain and simple.

Um...or play good music no matter what the format.

When you buy vinyl, the only person really making any sort of significant  
money is the pressing plant.  It makes a lot more sense, economically, to  
cut out the middle man.

I think you're dead wrong there.  The only people making significant
money are the distributors.  If there''s any middle man in the process
it's definitely the distributors.

I will admit that there was a time I said I would never go the route of  
playing cd's, but Ive overcome that aspect and decided to only play tunes  
that....

1.) are either done by my friends who are looking for self promotion as a  
producer

or

2.) Being handed down tunes from those that are up in the world, just  
trying to help a fellow Dj make their way throught the scene as well.

I can surely tell you one thing, and I mean this. IF the vinyl industry  
were to take its fall, I'd never play an all disc set period. Id probably  
buy them to listen to, but I'd never play out unless I played the all  
ready bought records I have now.

It IS a form of art, and can only be brought to you by those that feel it.  
AND for anyone to put you down as a dj that plays records, better  
recognize how this whole thing started. Only art I see with their cd case,  
is the one Im about to draw on it.

Ill have some up, but as for now.... I don't feel like showing off tits  
and ass. ;)

Depends on the situation on who makes more, i guess.

I am siked about this record.  I didn't think they were as well
rounded as they are.
They are also doing some funky house under the name of Dilate.

he didnt believe me.

you guys all seem to be missing one major point. Cd's, Vinal, the 
turntables and mixer themselves are nothing but TOOLS. Just like a 
violin or a guitar are tools. To a musician any tool is a good tool 
because it opens a new range of potential for the artist to weave his 
craft with. Would we still be having a debate if it was "awww man drums 
soo kick guitars assss!" because that is the equivalent of whats going

I don't really think thats the point of the discussion at all.  There
are only mabey 2 or 3 people on the list that are 100% against cds.  I
think it's great that people are playing tunes that are dope and most
likely will never be pressed, thats moving things forward in a good
way.  What I don't like or understand is why some people play stuff on
cd that sucks just so they can say it's a dub.  And when big dj's play
stuff that IS on vinyl and play it on cd that just breaks my head.  I
lost respect for the mighty dsl when I saw him drop fast car on cd
after it was out... thats two strikes against him... well he gets two
strikes for playing fast car, so that makes 3.  That just shows to me
that they aren't even into it anymore, it's just about the money, at
that point it's time to step down and let the people that care about
what the play do thier thing.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

i just want to write one thing that this post made me think about,
there is a track i have been diggin on by the postal service that is
"nothing better" a remix  by 'styrofoam'? the breakdown to me sounds
alot like the old partially corrupted mp3 files that were sent as ASC
instead of BIN transfers, very glitch sounding.  this sampled sound is
the drum sections on the breakdown, and to me, i thought it was
brilliant to sample that sound and use it on a mix.  a tool of
sampling a glitch in technology.  in most cases i will agree that
vinyl sounds better, especially when you are looking for that big
sound and smooth sound that only vinyl offers... when you get into the
glitchier, more minimal stuff, to me it doesnt matter the medium.

Depends on the situation on who makes more, i guess.
 AT LEAST  its going to someone who supports the music.
Whether it be the mfg., distr., record store, or artist.
It stays IN the scene/industry.  It feeds family.

Ok, hippie.  Put the bong down.


You want to support an artist?  Go see him/her perform.  Wow, that was  
hard.

I'm not against using all the tools at your disposal.  I don't think the =
Hospital guys really were either.

They examples they used are people who all swore off vinyl for one =
reason or another.

I have a big post at home that I may or may not end up sending tonight =
or tomorrow.

It starts with this story which was told to me by a dj from out of town:

"All of my friends make fun of me because I still buy vinyl and I think =
it is to ease their own conscious and justify their use of cds only.  I =
think they need me to be like them so that they don't look begin to look =
foolish."=20

That comment, combined with the Hospital interview, and a few other =
things that had been floating in my mind which is why I started this =
thread.


Out of every 1 dj I see using digital cd in a sensible manner -- I see =
20 fucking clowns.  Supporting digital media as the future is NOT a new =
arguement -- I wish I could name like 30 people who 5 years ago were =
screaming the same thing and I'd name them but I can't remember because =
they all slipped into irrelevancy.  Ask me in another 5 years and I'll =
give you the list I put together today.

There are djs, and there are producers.  Producers who are playing out =
and creating music on the fly should not be calling themself a dj.  =
Those people aren't even concerned with selling tracks anyhow because it =
isn't about one track for them.   The rest of the points have already =
been made.

  I don't really think thats the point of the discussion at all.  There
  are only mabey 2 or 3 people on the list that are 100% against cds.  I
  think it's great that people are playing tunes that are dope and most
  likely will never be pressed, thats moving things forward in a good
  way.  What I don't like or understand is why some people play stuff on
  cd that sucks just so they can say it's a dub.  And when big dj's play
  stuff that IS on vinyl and play it on cd that just breaks my head.  I
  lost respect for the mighty dsl when I saw him drop fast car on cd
  after it was out... thats two strikes against him... well he gets two
  strikes for playing fast car, so that makes 3.  That just shows to me
  that they aren't even into it anymore, it's just about the money, at
  that point it's time to step down and let the people that care about
  what the play do thier thing.

kinematic is an mp3 label outa austrailia...static owns it...they picked up
a song we finished about a week ago...as soon as i have details on the
release ill post them

yeah ive heard most of noisias smooth stuff...phace does alot of smooth
stuff too...i like it...cuz even tho its a little smoother it still has that
dark funk to it....phace's smooth stuff almost sounds like plastikman or
something.

Ok so your about the same as me for half of the dnb I listen too.  Did
you know Noisia is on the smooth tip as well, under the monkier of
drifter?

threadid=286785&highlight=noisia+drifter
I am siked about this record.  I didn't think they were as well
rounded as they are.
They are also doing some funky house under the name of Dilate.

btw, what the hell is kinematic?

Do the people that come see you support your habits?..

I think he was just saying that by us (being) underground (or whatever you  
want to call it now) buying and playing their tunes is supporting those

Yeah man, I hope to hear a lot more stuff like this in the future.  It

I think the whole redbook (and the rainbow of "books")
CD encoding format was a brilliant idea in terms of
technology.  Im as anti corporate as the next guy, but
letting Sony, Phillips etc, get some coin so that they
can create the next level of tech for hackers to
exploit, and for folks like us to explore new options
is pretty fucking awesome. We cannot live in the
bronze age forever!

plus, vinyl is an OLD technology. To agree that some
"corporate motherfucker" collecting coin on an
antiquated technology is ok would be the equivalent of
agreeing that Disney can hold mickey mouse out of
public domain for more than the set 99 years... 

CD/DVD however is what..only 45-50 years old? let 'em
earn some cash to have incentive, man!

I agree with this totally.  I hope that at some point
in the far future, there is still some kinda
scene...otherwise, it makes everything we did as
twentysomethings in this beloved "scene" worthless.
Social Security? hell nah, I want my AM easy listening
station that plays kompakt records all day...and I
want to hear Muzak versions of UR records when I go to
get my senior discount at Ponderosa.

so, supporting now (by *buying* records,CDs, and going
to see folks play) ensures that we wont look like we
wasted our youth on nothing! 

this i my opinion of course, and im probably wrong.

...i think this speaks to his good character...

http://website.tiesto.com/index1.html

Tiësto - 2005-04-20
Hi everybody,

I just came back from my Disney weekend. What can I say? WOOOW!!!!

When they first asked me to play at Disney Paris I actually wondered how
that would be like. It is kinda different to perform in a place like that,
and so I didn't really know what to expect. After showing me the large
production they could set up, my viewpoint immediately changed.

And, I also thought that it would be a good chance for me to raise my
profile in France, as I never played there before. So now I could come and
do my debut performance in France, in Disney Resort Paris, with a top-class
production stage, and 500 journalists, 15 camera teams and 7.500 people
attending from all over Europe.

I didn't know what to expect from the crowd, it could be between 7 and 77
years old! But it wasn't, it was a great crowd and they went off on every
track I played. Imagine, April 16th in Paris, and an outdoor party... It was
only 10 degrees Celsius, there was no alcohol available and 7.500 people
were still going completely bananas!!!
I thought that was absolutely awesome! And it shows finally, that you CAN
enjoy electronic music without any stimulances and still have a great night!
Finally we can leave that image behind that you need any kind of drugs to
enjoy electronic music, and we had all those journalists present as
witnesses.

So please, stop asking me questions about the relation between drugs and
electronic music because with this show we've proven you can enjoy a good
party being just as you are! Big shout out to Disney for giving me this
great opportunity! Thanks to everybody who was at the show, you are real
party people!!!

Love,
Tiësto

drugs rule, they make you say things like "stimulances".

sure we can. humans have been alive and well in their present form
for thousands of years without digital technology. record players
still get the job done the best, why give up on them now? just
because its not convenient for people who dont really care about
music anyway? eh, who cares about THEM?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

Taking a picture of a crucifix submerged in urine is an artform. Fuck an 
art form. Fuck however you do it. I'll quit buying vinyl as soon as they 
start making computers that crash less than my needles fuck up. I love 
the freedom and creativity I have with Live (effing amazing really once 
you learn it), but as of about 2 minutes ago I just lost a 90 minute 
recording because my laptop fucked up.

I could play an awesome set out of peanut shells for all I care, and for 
all anyone cares. If you start reading the BS that electronic musicians 
that play live have to go though or start going through it yourself, 
you'll understand frustration like no other. Even though my Axis 9's are 
pretty stable, they still have some serious quirks -- sometimes they 
don't load CD's properly at all. I've had Mac and PC laptops, and 
they're either too damn slow or crash like hell. Most of my hardware is 
too difficult to use in a live situation so I'd just be standing there 
letting sequences play out. Plus its just a bit more fun for me to be 
doing something I enjoy (playing records).

What's really pertinent here is the inability for these "wankers" to 
articulate. They come off as total retards and describe things in an 
inexcusable manner. First off, if its in their business plan to make 
sure their DJ's are playing vinyl, they should make sure they're playing 
vinyl. If they want to explain what they feel their reasons are, then go 
ahead. The "The other guys suck and this is the way you should do it" 
method is assinine. Yay positive attitudes!

Yeah, everone is in it (life) for the sex, drugs, and drugs, but it 
doesn't mean you don't have to be a professional in the meantime. And 
that's the end of my totally unprofessional rant.

Grumble.

lessons we used a recording media known as the "cassette tape". We'd 
record ourselves playing and check our flaws. Now, it never made sense 
to me that the teacher was getting these things for 25% of the price 
they cost me at the five and dime, until I asked and found out he was 
getting bulk PRE-RIAA costs.

Check it out for yourself. Not only is sony/phillips getting a cut, so 
are these turds. Any blank audio recording media is subject to these 
surcharges. Its why sony is pushing minidiscs as regular storage with no 
audio capability... its the same discs, minus the charges -- just like 
blank CD's you buy. If they say "audio" be sure you're getting an extra 
shafting. Douchebags like sony make out like bandits three or four times 
when you buy something that's from their label. I'm not complaining 
though, everyone ends up being a shaftwarmer sometime, this is minor 
(although it leads me to beleive its part of the RIAA's attack on all 
things digital).

Ever use a S/PDIF interface? Ever watched television? Its no big deal. 
You'd probably be suprised as to what little fees you're subjected to 
without knowing it.

What megacorp owns the vinyl industry? I dunno, but I'm sure its 
someone, and I'm sure they're getting paid, even if it ends up being 
some silly tax on materials.

i think thats the problem with it...the patent for the vinyl making process
thats used now, mustve expired years ago...which means anyone with the
technical skill and the money can setup a pressing operation...the megacorps
definately dont like this cuz they dont get their cut...i guess if anyone is
getting paid, its probably whoever supplys the raw material...ie....the
petro-chemical industry.

if you buy vinyl, you're supporting big business oil companies and you
are supporting george bush.  stop the insanity.

(somewhere, somehow, a corporation is behind pretty much everything
you do minus dog-in-a-bathtub)

I don't know Tom.  I like the feel of vinyl myself.  But honestly for
sound quality and convenience I think for me the ideal listening
method is some 24/48 wavs saved on a SATA drive and loaded into
Ableton.  Then I can really cut shit up.  I still buy my share of
vinyl but I usually just play it once...to get it from vinyl to 24/48
wav.  I just purchased the new Autechre on CD and Vinyl and haven't
even opened the vinyl.  But that's just because I am a giant geek.

Then again I don't really care to DJ out for a bunch of people that
aren't going to get what you are doing anyways.  I am more of a studio
guy these days...and the thought of going to a club and listening to a
DJ play music I probably don't want to hear isn't my idea of a good
time anyways.  I would rather just stay at home in the studio and play
what I want to hear or make my own noise.

Its rather inevitable that this 'scene' as you refer to it is going to
die commercially.  We have had our influence on pop culture and now
most of us will be forgotten.  Records will stop being
pressed...labels, stores, distros, and plants will all go out of
business and the only remnants of the scene left will be the true few
who will continue making music and sharing it for free on the net in
flac format.  Free music and bedroom producers are the future of this
community.  It will cut out the fat and the people making crappy dj
friendly music out of prefabbed loops and pressing it to vinyl just
for their own righteous ego or to maintain their current
lifestyle...all that will be left are the people who make music for
music's sake.  IT professionals, factory workers, and pizza delivery
drivers will come home to their home studios and put their heart and
soul into a track so they can post it the net and give it away for
free under the creative commons license.


As for the rest of the conversation....."You lost me at Sasha."

Subject: {pb-cle} AE : Untilted (was Hospital records on cd djs.)

I think it is absolutely fantastic.  I would have to say it is my
favorite out of the last several albums (Draft 7.30, Confield, Gantz
Graf).  Allot of hidden funk in there.  It really grows on you like
with the last three albums.  The more you listen to it the more you
come to understand it.  At times the beats are so on the edge of
falling to pieces yet so perfect at the same time....absolute genius
at times.

I picked up new studio monitors the weekend before the new AE came out
so I have been breaking in my new monitors with it.  Sounds so good.

I heard the mp3's that are floating around of this album and they
don't do it justice at all.  This is definitely an album that needs to
be heard lossless.  Allot of subtleties in the transients.

Looking for the other tracks that weren't ID'd.

I've never made it a secret that i own tiesto mixes.

I thought there were parts of his last album that were actually pretty damn
good.

i wasn't as impressed as i thought i'd be. it's a lot faster (tempo-wise)
than i had expected.

i've heard better stuff in this vein played by Cutups and like-minded folk.

HOWEVER...i thought ae's live 8 hour marathon webcast was pretty brilliant.
i've actually been listening to it quite a bit.

If something's out on vinyl, why not play it on CD?

Hell, why not play it on Final Scratch or Serato Scratch?

What fucking difference does it really make, besides the fact you
don't have to bust your ass to carry 60lbs of records in a flight
case?

Vinyl gets old and degrades, and there's not enough market to
indefinitely repress everything.  It might be a better medium for
sound, but it's not going to last.

Suure you do ;)   I will forward you all my PVD links in a moment....
(just kidding about the links)
Which mix are you referring to>?  Id like to peep it.

I have a 12" wax single "fish taste" or something from Tiesto like 6 yrs ago.
He was producing a little darker/harder than the style he spins now.
I can only think of PVD when I hear him.  From underground straight to

CDs degrade as well. and actually some from the 80s are already
starting to do so, while my records that are 40 years old are
still awesome sounding.

It is a disservice to the culture.  12" culture..  Its hip-hop, its techno.
Its definitive.  CDs are a joke.

No respect.

Yes, the boys don't keep up with technology and still insist on playing  
music off a format that went out in the 70s.


Meanwhile, the men are making the best use of current technology.

I disagree wholeheartedly.

I saw DJ Shadow in 2002. Shadow is reputed as one of the hardest of hardcore
hip hop crate-diggers.

He had 2 Technics, 2 CDJ-1000's, and an MPC sampler on stage...all going
simultaneously at some points in the evening. He was able to layer his music
and not just play the tracks as they are on the albums/singles...in such a
way that everything was in perfect key and pitch, regardless of tempo. I've
never seen another DJ pull that off.

Don't believe me? Check out his "In Tune and On Time" DVD.

I've said it before, I'll say it again...I've heard $30,000 setups that
sound like ass, and I've heard $20 thrift store setups that sound like
angels were singing to me.

I don't care if you've got two spoons and a wash basin. Play something I can
groove to, and you're my main motherfucker....

Subject: {pb-cle} Pimp Daddy Welfare's Rebirth at the hands of a hypnotyza.

"I got my skillet and my wooden spoon..."  - pimp daddy welfare

>From Suburban Terrorism Online:

At first listen I wondered what the hell Pimp Daddy Welfare was
talking about because in the first lines he mentions he has his skillet and=
 a
wooden spoon.  Puzzled, yet still curious about the fine talent that could =
be
hidden behind the ingenious name, I continued to listen.  I could sense the
pain and anguish that has been stored inside this fine musician, pain and
anguish that can't be kept in anymore, pain and anguish that will be used t=
o
write one of the finest amateur raps I've ever heard.

        Pimp Daddy continues, bringing up the rap little by little until it
explodes into a climax of phat rhymes and amazing flow.  Immediately we see
that the rapper feels as though he has his image to fulfill, that he won't =
be
taken lightly, that his business is serious business.  Who can argue such
lines as  "Cookin at the Waffle House, I'm cookin up a fat rock of crack" a=
nd
"I wanna get drunk, real fucking drunk man, drunk as a skunk, drunker than =
a
skunk that's really drunk.  I wanna get so goddamned drunk that you can
smell my drunk funk from like, 50 miles away..."?  Pimp Daddy then terminat=
es
the verse with the most direct, mean punching line in the song, "And I want
some mothafuckin waffles too.".

        The rap proceeds into the chorus and it is here that Pimp Daddy sho=
ws
us his real mission at the Waffle House.  He tells us that he's cookin at t=
he
Waffle House as well as pursuing some sort of sexual relation.  We are also
given a glimpse at what could be a possible ass fetish Pimp Daddy has burie=
d
deep within his psychie.  Even though the song continues to build intensity=
,
it begins to spin into a downward spiral of lust and captivity.  We see tha=
t
the anguish, pain, and lust that has built up inside Pimp Daddy has finally
taken him over and assumed any control.

        Although the song remains consistent in verse:chorus ratio, the
hatred and aggressiveness continues to grow throughout the song as well as
the flow and rhyme.  There is definitly talent buried deep within in Pimp
Daddy... somewhere... if he will ever uncover this talent is something that
only he will ever know.  But I believe it is fair to say that this young,
striving musician has come along way since the days he was shaving his head
and listening to nothing but Pantera and Sepultura.  I think it is fair to
say that I give this song two squeeks becuase it is truly amazing.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

The funniest thing about the hospital video was the guy putting the cd
wallet under his arm and mock one of these big name djs walking to a
gig that way.

This might sound cheesy, but I really do love the feel of being
weighed down with a bag stuffed to the gills with records when going
to play somewhere.  If i was walking in with a little half-size 64-cd
wallet I'd feel like a complete chump.

when i play now, i take my record box and two of those white
postal thingies filled with records. it sucks having to load and
unload my car, especially in the rain or snow, but its so worth
it. when curt and i play records, we usually have more records
with us than 75% of "Deejays" out there own altogether.

the obvious difference being that you KNOW he owns all that shit

a label that reissues hard to find funk and soul and pays the
people who made it when he licenses it.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

Shadow has done his homework and then some... just the possibility of
downloading whatever's accessible to you digitally and playing that
out is what I think is bullshit about the whole digital culture.

There will always be purists / experts / etc and there will always be
chumps..  but most purists start out as chumps.  If you take away a
structure which encourages people to dig deeper and look beneath the
surface, you'll have less people seeking a broader musical
enlightenment.  Having to physically look through bins for music
exposes people to so many more accidental discoveries and stuff they'd
never check out in a million years.  By making people do the work, it
makes for a better DJ and music lover, even if they never planned to
get into it that deep.

By letting people just click away and get exactly what they want, and
not invest any time digging, or any money (lets say by stealing via
soulseek etc), you just are making the next generation a bunch of
chumps...  DJ Shadow is not the next generation.  All the "kids"
looking for something to enable them to get somewhere quick, are all
lining up behind this technology.

The argument is that anyone who uses pirated material to make money is a =
chump.

The point is -- when it comes to MP3 or CD there is no copyright =
protection.

There *will* be another format to come along, and mp3 is essentially =
like betamax.   .acs (is that what its called?) might be a start.

If you have money invested in vinyl, you are fucking moron if you use =
digital media when you play out (expecially when you are not on the =
road), unless you are the type of dj who is doing "on the fly =
production" with software like ableton or if you are playing unreleased =
material.  It is comical how people have gotten bent out of shape over =
this comment when there are djs who bought final scratch SOLELY as a =
means of justifying their piracy.

Know what the real arguement is before you comment.

All really good.


Also many people...even some magazines and online stores are referring
to the album as 'untitled' as in not having a title.  But it is
actually 'untilted'....as in not on a tilt...not tilted.  I have a
feeling the AE  guys expected such confusion to take place though.

<<The argument is that anyone who uses pirated material to make money is a
chump.>>

No, no it wasn't.

Here are direct quotes to which I was responding:

1) "Its definitive.  CDs are a joke. Please people!  TELL ME DIFFERENT!  can
these CDDJs get respect>?"

2) "Hell, promoters!  Dont hire digital DJs!"

3) "Just in case we forgot...
      Vinyl = art
     CD = wedding DJ"


Nothing whatsoever to do with Piracy, downloading or MP3's.

Why would I bring up piracy, mp3's or downloading when talking about DJ
Shadow who is OBVIOUSLY playing his own music????

There are people on this list saying "Anyone who shows up with anything but
records is a chump". The statements I quoted back that up.

And I'm here saying: If that's what you really think, you're closed-minded
and caught up in your own bullshit.

I have not said that turntables and vinyl are bad in any way...I actually
think they're wonderful, amazing tools, and are a core part of the history
of recorded music and certainly the #1 contributing factor to DJ and
danceculture.

But anyone who is willing to, on a whim or for their own reasons (like, say,
the owner of a store that sells VINYL), dismiss anything that ISN'T vinyl is
being willfully ignorant.

Sasha isn't pirating SHIT.
DJ Shadow isn't pirating SHIT.
And THEY ARE USING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY.

Anyone who attempts to stand there and say that so-and-so is "not a DJ
because he's not using vinyl" is straight up wrong.

<<Know what the real arguement is before you comment.>>

I agree. Perhaps you should've read my post and my response twice.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

I think the problem is that the mp3 deejays are what everyone is
targeting with the whole cd's suck thing, not the actual people that
use cd's they bought or are 'the hot freshness' of unreleased music.

vinyl is something that you cant download.  that's why it has that
vintage appeal.  you cant bootleg a piece of vinyl short of still
spending dough.

cd's are being attacked because of their versatility and easy way for
people to cheat the system and play pirated music.  if you could
download to vinyl, the same people would be screaming on why cd's are
better than vinyl.  <SEGUE SEGUE SEGUE!> People feel good about
bringing in their record crates because there is no disputing that
they bought that shit and earned every cent that it took to buy the
records.  deejays are typically broke asses, or living just enough
above poverty to afford the monthly "record stipend" or even better
making the "Ramen for Records" compromise with their body.  At least
that's the way I see it.

But then Tom and Co. wouldn't have anything to bitch about. Oh wait,
what was I thinking? Then they'd just bitch about the records you had in
the case. Or the weight. Or the clothes you wear while carrying it. Or
the fact that they can't spin. Etc.

I'm really beginning to thing that all the vinyl lovers are just
pathetic djs who are using it as an excuse to never get any better at
performing.

95% of the people who go to mega-raves wouldn't even notice. Nor should
they.

And he would laugh in your face as he cashed his big check.

People stuck on 1960's technology are the joke.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} trance in my hot pants

Wow...so I did listen (:-p)...and let me tell you...Trance was not this
gheigh when I listened to it in my hay day. Seriously...this set was so
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fucking boring. What ever
happened to HIGH ENERGY GLOW STICK TRANCE!??? Ok, maybe not that much
energy...but still...I recognized a few tracks, but these were even dull
remixes. Oh my...and the MC...why do Europeans bother getting on the mic
with this trance poop? Oh that?s right...cause its boring!

I can just picture the people in the crowd crying as the epic-ness drops
upon their heads. I would too....if Tiesto were my god. Yah. Exactly.
Fucking lame. 

I listened to the whole 2 and a half our set in under one hour. I'm sorry, I
couldn't take too much of it. Give me some downtempo house and I'll enjoy it
more. Really. Minimal techno pulls out its wang out and urinates on Tiesto.
Hard acid techno might even bother to grab a seat and drop a protein filled
brown one on this set.

Too remind myself real music still exsisted, I put on some Dieselboy circa
96 as soon as my eyes began to close.

Ishkur....where are YOU???????

Sadly yet not surprisingly dissapointed,

Forte

If its digital it will never be copy protected in a way that works.
Going back to the early computer days with hardware device dongles
where required to run certain software. People learned to manufacture
there own dongles. If its digital it can be cracked one way or
another.

Why so that my prize possessions can be degraded every time i play
them. I would rather have wax under my fingers then a jog wheel but at
some point you have to be honest with yourself. The age of vinyl is
over and has been for quite awhile. Its sad it bothers me and i morned
its passing.

Music should be free but that is a debate that would just run us in circles=
.

People will make great music regardless of the medium.
People will steal regardless of the product.
People will gather to hear a good dj do his thing regardless of how he
does it. If you look at a dj and are put off or pissed off or bothered
because they are grooving with final scratch then your missing the
point you are supposed to be listening to the choons.

all my old cds are fine...the only problem ive noticed with cd

discs...and they never play burned discs...but ive never had a cd degrade or 
wear out...as long as they are kept clean and scratch free they should play 
as long as there is a cd player....now old vinyl on the other hand....you 
can run the discwasher over as much as you want...its still gonna click and

Come out the the Dance Ritual this weekend. You'll see a few djs
spinning cds, for sure. I'll bet real money that every one if them is
better than you.

Not to mention if and when a cd does wear out you just burn from the
master that you have archived digitally. you are out what 1.25 for the
new cd.

<<Man its all about Kid Koala.>>

cat is SICK....have you ever seen him?

i saw this video once from his "book tour" where he was scratching on an old
hand-crank victrola...like the kind with the big horn-for-a-speaker from the
early 20th century.

CD's,MP3s, Vinyl? who really gives a shit?

if i could get on the microphone, and do my best
Akufen impression, and get people rockin' im going to
do that.

Really, the people really dont give a shit about the
medium, the super duper intricate mixes, the reverb on
that snare, or if the record/CD is an original or not.
Nor do they care what synth made what patch. What
matters is how many ladies get down. all that other
shit is just the unspoken DJ competition,and chin
scratching nonsense.....which is really...really
tiring. 

is it bullshit that people will download stuff and
play it out? 

by the same token, is it bullshit to be a producer,
use hacked software, make tracks and sell records?

in the end it dont matter. Just as long as what you do
makes the ladies dance, and hopefully, a few folks get
to leave the club with a few phone numbers.

Subject: {pb-cle} NRR:random


its amazing how easy it is to procrastinate.....
I dont even know who's really on here anymore... its terrible, i'm still on 
this list yet i delete most messages before i evn read the subject line.
I was sifting thru some of the pics on the pb-cle site.... I just wonder 
what people are up to, you know.... where are these people? are they in 
ohio/PA? are they in jail? pregnant? lawyers? Accountants? UPS men? Do they 
live on farms? Work retail? Did they cut their hair? marry their girlfirend? 
start eating meat?
dont know if anyone cares....but my hair grew back, i'm 'in the area', my 
'pants' are in a box in the closet that i figure the kids i may have one day 
will find and wonder 'what the hell was my mother thinking?!' the last 2 
times i danced were at weddings (god i miss dancing). i still love jokes, 
especially ones about pirates.
so what about everyone else?
luv
becca

                    Under the same management since 1996
-=<O>=---------------------------------------------------------------=<O>=-

Originating from Cuyahoga Falls, a place neither Pittsburgh or
Cleveland!  I consider the PB-CLE area as far west as Columbus and
Dayton and as far east as State College.  Maybe more, maybe less!  I'm
now including some Buffalo, Detroit, and DC events in the ROM, as well
as some somewhat related concert events.  I'm also now listing toronto 
since pittsburgh and cleveland seem to have a total lack of events.

 ****  PROMOTERS SUBMITTING EVENTS PLEASE GOTO
 ****  http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/guidelines.php
 ****  FOR THE GUIDELINES FOR EVENTS

i am once again listing weeklies. they are listed towards the end. if you 
see an event no longer happening, drop me a mail.

* This list is not for redistribution or publication without permission *

The region i list is approximately 5 hours driving time from Akron,
Ohio.  I do list events farther than this if they are special in some way
and might be of interest to people in the pbcle region.

I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the information here as i'm
mostly relaying it from email or typing it in from a flyer (typos *DO*
happen), but will gladly fix any errors or omissions, just let me know!

The web page is updated throughout the week, you can check that for the
latest information.
http://www.hyperreal.org/raves/pb-cle/rom/ 
set your bookmarks appropriately  :)

Submissions, flames, threats, hot graver pictures, and your credit card 
numbers to:

   trout@hyperreal.org

if an event is found to have a bad email address or infoline, they will be
removed, there MUST be a way to contact you about the event, by ravers and
other promoters.

INDOOR / OUTDOOR SHOW on Huge Outdoor Private Patio

Featuring

Stacy Kidd & Dj Seven: 2 Hour 2x4 House Set
Chicago, IL 

WWW.DJSEVENCHICAGO.COM


Stacy Kidd was born in Chicago in 1972 and started DJing in 1987 after 
being amazed by the music he was hearing on the radio. He started out 
recording Chicago house mixes off the radio, and would try to mix them 
together with 2 tape decks. He would even try to mix them together on 
one radio with 2 tape players on it. After doing that for a year, Stacy 
began to have a good ear for the music and started to buy records.. but 
didn.t even own a turntable yet. It wasn.t until 1989 when he finally 
got a single turntable and started to mix with one turntable and one 
tape deck. Having mixed for a while without a pitch control on tape 
decks, using the turntable came naturally.

In 1990 Stacy was invited to play at a house party where he first used 
two turntables. There he met Paul Johnson who was a guest at the party. 
Stacy was playing a lot of unknown tracks he received from other 
producers like Ron Hardy, DJ Rush, Armando and Farley JM Funk. Paul also 
had some unknown material so they stared comparing tracks. Stacy would 
play one, then Paul would play one. This went on for hours. Soon after, 
they began to hang out and work on music together regularly.

In 1994 Stacy completed his first record with Paul on Dance Mania 
Records called "Stacy Kidd & Pilly P Doing Thangs Vol 1." They went on 
to do two more volumes before Stacy completed his first solo project 
called "15213 Loomis" on Dance Mania Records in 1996. Following Paul 
Johnson.s advise on musical styles, Stacy put out three club records 
that same year on Huge Records (Chicago), Relief Records (Chicago) and 
Peacefrog Records in London. In 1997 he started traveling with Paul and 
performing at different events all over the world.

The following year, Stacy made a huge impact on the club scene when he 
released five records on Dusttraxx Records (Chicago), Aftermidnight 
Records (Holland), Riviera Records (France), Daddy Records - a sub label 
of Peacefrog (London) and a remix for Ministry of Sound Records in 
London. He continued to release records and travel meeting a lot of DJs 
& producers from all over the world. By the year 2000, Stacy reached a 
whole new level, he was working on more vocal projects and remixes for 
larger labels as well as joining many tours and studio sessions with a 
lot of the top house music producers in the game.

In 2002, Stacy started his own production company, "Underground 
Elements", which includes vocalists Joi Williams and Matthew Yates, 
producers/DJ.s Tim Funatik (Dallas), Melvin Meeks (Chicago), Scott Payne 
(Chicago), and Ice Mike Lataker (Chicago).  In 2003, Stacy Kidd.s "HOT", 
got him recognized as one of the most versatile up-and-coming producers 
in Chicago by DJ Magazine.   Stacy also joined the Louie Vega and Kenny 
Dope (MAW) family on their new label "Kenlou Records."  Stacy has DJed 
all over the world and the U.S. and has a lot more production coming out 
of .Underground Elements. in the near future.

Rob Riddum, Cleveland . DnB/Turntablist

Rob Riddum is one of the most well known and dedicated Drum and Bass DJs 
in the Ohio scene today. The legacy began in 1996 as Riddum took his 
funky set to the streets as member of the popular Elements Squad. 

He has since cemented his reputation as a talented artist through his 
innovative, seamless mixing, dope track selection, and uniquely Riddum 
scratching technique. After taking a hiatus from the scene to focus on 
his studies at Kent State University, Riddum returns with a renewed 
determination to take the world of Drum and Bass to the next dimension.

When he's not out dropping his dope beats to live audiences across the 
Ohio and Pennsylvania scenes, you can find him in the studio pioneering 
the sounds of Drum and Bass as he is laying down his unique and powerful 
vibe in production of his own tracks.

Riddum recently produced the sound track and programmed individual 
tracks for MTV's Jackass and the "Steve-o, Don't Try This at Home Tour". 
"80's", an upbeat drum and bass track with a funky synth line, is slated 
for release early 2003.

Riddum is a talented, seasoned veteran of the scene and throws down an 
incredible set. His unmatched attention to detail and focus on the 
technical aspects of the art of DJing guarantees a seemless, spectacular 
performance that will leave the audience in awe and begging for more.

Detroit's Movement festival becomes FUSE-in
25/02/2005

Kevin Saunderson and MusicLogical announced plans today to produce 
FUSE-in Detroit this Memorial Day weekend (May 28, 29, 30) at Hart Plaza 
in Detroit, Michigan.

A multi-year contract was signed with the City of Detroit allowing 
Saunderson to produce the festival, originally known as The Detroit 
Electronic Music Festival(DEMF) and more recently, Movement. The 
festival's new name FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic Movement, represents a 
new beginning and a new harmony to the event, with hopes to unify the 
City of Detroit, electronic music fans and its culture worldwide.

Saunderson offered, "...MusicLogical has been created to fuse and 
celebrate music's finest role - to bring people together and remove all 
bias." Under the auspices of Detroit Techno's founding father, 
MusicLogical is committed to building on the integrity and legacy of 
Detroit music, furthering in the process Electronic Music as a genre.

As festival Producer, Saunderson has put together a core team of 
professionals to carry out this vision. New Festival Director, Ade' 
Mainor, presently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Submerge, 
a globally-celebrated Detroit record label and production company, 
promises to deliver a world class festival like no other. Scott McIntyre 
was chosen to serve asFestival Marketing Director.

McIntyre and his Michigan company, TheBigHouse, have been involved at 
many levels in marketing and producing successful events, broadcasts, 
and media from locations from as far as France to Mexico to California 
at festivals, on radio and in clubs. Formally continuing his 
ground-shaking efforts from lastyear's show is Olof van Winden, Chairman 
of The Generator Foundation, a European group which profiles itself in 
Art, Music and Technology. Van Winden will serve this year as the 
official International Festival Director, assisting with foreign 
sponsorship, artist related services, tourism board and ministry of 
culture throughout Europe.

Public Relations Director/Festival Spokesperson this year is Barbara 
Deyo. Deyo dates back to the inaugural DEMF, as the head of Marketing 
and PR, and has continued on as press agent to Kevin Saunderson, as well 
as being a consistent voice and liaison in the Electronic Music 
community.

The MusicLogical staff is working fast and furious to secure vital 
sponsorships and a best-ever global talent line-up for this year's 
festival. With the festival for '06 already in process, and representing 
a massive shift in form and function this year, we will be asking for 
broad community support - help is welcomed and needed.

Two kick-off and fundraising parties will be held Sunday March 13 at 
Fifth Avenue Comerica Park AND Sunday April 3 at The Necto in Ann Arbor. 
Line up and details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for the debut of 
the FUSE-in Detroit web site at www.FUSE-inDetroit.com presenting news, 
information, schedules and volunteer opportunities.

A press conference to announce a full line up and sponsors is being 
planned
for early April. Details forthcoming...FUSE-in: Detroit's Electronic 
Movement :: May 28, 29, 30 :: 12pm-12am ::

Champions of furthering the turntablist movement, the X-ecutioners made 
their reputation by utilizing the techniques of beat-juggling; the 
manual alteration between individual kick and snare sounds to create 
original drum patterns in real time. This practice has been an 
inspiration and a force in Roc Raida's style. His impressive finishes 
in some of the premier DJ battles; (first place in the 1991 "As One"; 
second place in the "Superman Battle"; and second place in the 1992 DMC 
US Finals, and 1995 DMC World Champion) as well as featured on an 
episode of "Saturday Night Live"; (the first DJ to ever) has made him an 
american icon. Inducted into the DMC Hall of Fame at the DMC World 
Finals in New York City, as well as the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, Raida was appointed "Grandmaster", by some of Hip-Hop’s 
founding fathers. Raida solidifies his "Grandmaster" status by creating 
a vibrant mix of underground hip-hop skillfully creating a fantasy 
mix-show with a tongue-in-cheek look into the hip hop world. Now, 
traveling around the globe promoting the art of Turntablism in such 
exotic locations as Singapore, Turkey, Japan and Australia. Roc Raida is 
considered among the best of the contemporary DJ's and has brought the 
underground art of Turntablism to a fresh new level.

DEEP PROGRESSIVE TECHNOLOGY

Amidst the thousands of artists and producers that work in the EDM 
industry today, Curtis and Leaha are of the few who strive to create 
truly original musical compositions. The live Progressive Breakbeat duo 
has been shredding the airwaves, dance floors, and club scene with their 
exceptional productions and intense performances. Their impeccable 
fusion of harmonious melodies and earth shaking beats creates a unique 
style and sound that cannot be matched.

Burufunk is best known for their chart topping remixes which include: BT 
"Somnambulist" (Nettwerk), Deepsky "Talk like a Stranger" (Yoshi Toshi), 
and Wrecked Angle "Back to Babyon" (Electrofly) which had remained in 
the Balance Record Pool top 20 for more than ten weeks. They were also 
recognized as one of the winners in the BPM Magazine Remix Contest for 
their rendition of BT's "The Great Escape". Their most recent remix 
collaboration had them working with BT to create: BT vs The Doors "Break 
on Through (To the Other Side).

Their signature tracks have been heavily supported by the likes of Paul 
Oakenfold, BT, Deepsky, Hybrid and DJ Icey to name a few. Likewise, 
their first release together "Outsider" was featured on Global 
Underground 024 'Reykjavik' mixed by Nick Warren. Look to Godsend Music 
for more Burufunk material launching this summer as well as an upcoming 
album in the works.

There is so much that can be said about these visionaries... but their

ANTIX (Iboga Records . New Zealand) LIVE!
Based in Auckland New Zealand, Barton and Hayden Strom are the producers 
behind the project ANTIX.  The Strom brother.s dedication to pushing 
their style in new directions in the ever evolving Progressive Trance 
genre has made them one of the emerging acts to watch for in their 
scene.  Both Barton and Hayden were introduced to music at a young age 
listening, to music from their parent.s vast record collections.  They 
quickly became addicted to the hypnotic sounds of Trance in '95 when a 
friend handed them a tape urging them to check it out.  Barton instantly 
purchased a mixer and started DJ'ing at small parties in the growing 
Auckland scene.  Six months later he had moved to Japan to buy studio 
equipment and teach himself the art of production, and Hayden later 
joined him.  Together they returned to New Zealand, setting up various 
studios around Auckland and refining a sound, which really came together 
once they moved to the West Coast of the North Island and set up Slow 
Burn
 ing
Studios in '99.  The sound that seemed to evolve was a kind of minimal 
organic groove influenced by the European sound being played by DJ 
PHILIPP from Plastik Park and ANTI from Spiral Trax.  It wasn't long 
before a connection was made when Philipp toured Australia and New 
Zealand in 2000, and ANTIX were signed for their first 12", "Rainstick," 
on Plastik Park.  Over the years the two have managed to put a few of 
the "big ones" under their belts, playing the U-Site Fusion Festival in 
Germany, The Boom in Portugal, and The Rainbow Serpent in Australia.  
And now three years down the line, ANTIX completed their long awaited 
debut album "Lull" released on the Danish label Iboga Records.  The duo 
are currently touring the globe for the third year, they are only half 
way to completing this tour, but so far its been a huge success, playing 
parties in Denmark, Sweden, Croatia, Japan, the Voov Festival 2003 in 
Germany and then in London, where they played alongside other respected 
kiw
 i
artists for the annual New Zealand music night at club Fabric.  And now 
to continue the tour ANTIX will play in Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Austria and then to finish in France.  On top 
of this they.ve also been involved in Auckland label Manta.  The label 
has just released its second 12" and third compilation "Subduction" 
featuring a excellent selection of New Zealand and international, 
Progressive/Psy-Trance which are all available from Cyberculture Records 
at (www.cyberculture.co.nz).  So at last...  Here comes the second full 
length album from ANTIX - "Twin Cost Discovery."  Since their first 
album - "Lull" - released on Iboga Records in June 2003, ANTIX had major 
success with their very groovy and unique style.  They have been playing 
their live set at a great number of events and have made a very good 
name for themselves in the scene.  Now two years later, Iboga Records is 
proud to be releasing another well produced album.  From start to end
  the
Strom brothers take you on a journey deep into their soundscapes.  You 
can truly tell that ANTIX has spent many hours making this album come 
true, and once again they surprise with their style, going in a new 
direction.

DEVIANT SPECIES (Ambivalent Records . London) LIVE!
DEVIANT SPECIES are the England based electronic duo who are currently 
touring Japan consisting of Santos De Castro and Paul Wright.  
Consistently releasing their unique take on the London Techno sound for 
the past five years, they are now preparing to release their third 
album, "In the Hands of the Randomiser," later this year on Ambivalent 
Records.  From the Warlock Studios comes the long-awaited album by 
DEVIANT SPECIES.  No need for introductions, once more you will be 
treated to nine quality-consistent cuts of dark and minimal psychedelia 
for the blackest hours of the night.  In this third album installment by 
DEVIANT SPECIES the band is now only made up of Santos De Castro with 
collaborations with ex-DEVIANT SPECIES member Paul Konrad Wright (now of 
N.R.S. fame) and ground-breaking producer Ady Connor from SCORB.  The 
atmosphere prevailing here is hard, with tinges of Industrial and 
Ambient intros and outros that cross-over giving the album a continuous 
flow.  It all ki
 cks off
with "Voice of Thard," a chugging and spatial number that builds up to a 
ripping chorus.  "Pincushion Man" continues with galloping intensity 
where "...Thard" left off moving relentlessly to a climatic final before 
"Shellless" ebbs in soothingly with an overture of peerless Gothic 
beauty.  The tight pulse is quickly restored leading to a frantic groove 
that allows you to breathe with its interspersed waves of noise.  On a 
slightly softer tip "Thermal Boundaries" follows with an infectious beat 
that gradually gathers momentum to trancing-out effect.  In a similar 
rolling yet relaxed vein enters "The Retinal Circus," which has been 
doing the bootleg rounds in an earlier unfinished version titled "The 
Abyss."  To follow, "In the Hands of the Randomiser" is the first 
collaboration between DEVIANT SPECIES and SCORB, a powerful track that 
starts with an Industrial soundscape and steamrolls forward into a 
roaring pay-off.  For the darkest hour "A Night to Dismember" brings the 
proce
 edings
to total mayhem before the forces of light emerge.  "Portal to Balojax" 
is a 3-minute-plus unwinding ambient piece and serves as a prologue to 
"The Entrapment of John Dory," the only morning track in the album and 
the second DEVIANT SPECIES vs. SCORB outing, a delicate cut destined to 
be a classic.

Thats fine for young bucks that have nothing to do but chase pussy with a 
budwiser in one hand and a glow stick in the other.  Frat boy economics.  
To some, it does matter what medium is used.  It shows professionalism and 
how well the artist/dj or producer can do with what.  Hell, anyone can stand on 
stage and play mp3s with Tractor or mix a "live set" with Rex loops or Live.  
Its simply a way to judge a level of performance and to what degree.  But this 
is not the issue.  The issue is about who pays for their music and on what 
medium...

Wrong, that's why I go to a club or rave.  Not to rub elbows with jocks. 
Maybe to dance...

Yea, they should pace around looking for rolls, and lay in the middle of the 
dance floor.
No wonder this scene is so fuked up.  No one <cares> about the music.
They just want to get fuked up and troll for pussy.


<<<And he would laugh in your face as he cashed his big check.>>>>

Yea Tiesto sure is laughing.  And im stuck with his bullshit music.
(its probably all on CD)

<<<People stuck on 1960's technology are the joke.>>>

Maybe.  I will still hold and caress my record collection as you will
worship your budwiser and SUV.

well of course i would, unless he had good records in there.
obviously its pretty difficult for most people to find good
records since they never seem to be playing them.

sounds like a good night of music... should do it at the shadow lounge

options?

>Well good for you. I'm sure the audience in your bedroom
appreciates it.

of course its futile for me to point out that the audience in my
bedroom would be watching something else besdies me deejaying
since i dont even have a single turntable in my house. i actually
get all the practice i need at my residency, or the numerous other
gigs both regular and not that i play at. 

>We've all heard you spin, Tom. Who do you think you're kidding?

obviously not you, since youre so on top of things. 

>Come out the the Dance Ritual this weekend. You'll see a few djs
>spinning cds, for sure. I'll bet real money that every one if them is
>better than you.

im not usually arrogant about this kind of thing, but when jokers
like you try to tell me something about deejaying it just irks the
shit out of me. i dont think its possible to have less of an idea
about whats going than you do. MAYBE if you had any knowledge or
experience i would listen to your opinion. but probably not. since
you have neither, im really not that worried. but you can come
watch me and d battle it out if youd like. or you can feel free to
come to any number of the gigs that i have in the next few weeks.
or really you can just listen in 3 weeks when curt and i play on
wyep on friday may 13th. im pretty sure you can listen on the web.

The best place to shop is your local record shop.  No one goes there
anymore, thats why we only have one left in Pittsburgh but it's the
only way I can get the whites, they sell out in a matter of minutes on
the web.  If that is not an option then www.breakbeatscience.com,
www.redeyerecords.co.uk or www.chemical-records.co.uk

He introduced me as well.  I'll never forget my first night at the

got one around here somewhere.  I'll digitize it if I find it.  Good
Ol' "Grampa Techno"!  He's on some old harcore stuff from europe, I
got to get some of those classics.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Good online store for jungle records?

THere aren't any local record stores left in Columbus,
are there?

I tried to go by All City Beats a while back and they
seem to be no more... The only other one I knew was
culture 7, which has been gone for a while..

When you become someone behind the decks or someone thats knowledgable  
enough to understand why we appreciate the things we play, then you'll  
come to understand why it may be... such a huge issue.

Aight. 

I personally feel that CD's, Final Scratch, MP3s and
anything other than vinyl should only be used when:
you can't get it on vinyl, or you had it on vinyl but
lost it so you only have it on cd right now, you want
to play your friend's shit, you want to play your own
shit, it's out of print, etc. I got Final Snatch a
while back and it's sitting in my studio collecting
dust. I'm thinking about selling it actually. 

I find CD/digital djs to be terribly boring. Correct
me if I'm wrong, but I'm almost positive you will not
see someone like Ben Sims spinning on 3 cd decks. And
what about turntablists? Do you really want to watch
some choad scratch on a CDJ or would you be more
impressed seeing him do it the good ol' fashioned way?
Man when I see a chump on stage spinning nothing but
some digital shit, all I can think is yeah ok, next...


It really comes down to personal preference though. I
find the whole digital craze to be extreme wackness,
but to each his own I guess. However I will never
allow someone to give me shit for playing records -
fawk THAT. Tell me I'm hangin' on to some old
technology - I really could care less. 

You SHOULD care how the performer is bringing the
music to you though. I mean come on, if it really
doesn't matter, then why the hell are you gonna pay
out your ass for an event when you can just listen to
the shit at home? Or just put a big ol' stereo system
on stage and set that shit on RANDOM PLAY and voila!
You fokes that constantly bitch about djs no matter if
it's vinyl or digital need to stop. You know who you
are and you're being stupid because you keep attending
events where there are djs. You don't like djs? Stop
going then! Stop buying mix tapes and cds! Stop
talking about how you want to see so and so at
club/party xyz! There - problem solved so STFU
already!

I will buy and play records until I can't anymore.
It's my personal preference plain and simple and it's
not hurting anybody. You don't like it or think
there's something wrong with that then stay the fawk
away from me. Ask a dj who's TRULY in love with
his/her music collection which format is going to make
them want to touch themselves all night long - for me
it's gotta be the vinyl... oooOOOooo sexayyyy

You know, they do make record cases with wheels. I use
a luggage cart for mine because no one wants to carry
my pink box of death. As for stairs, well that can
pose a bit of a strain, but shit, don't be so damn
lazy! Drag that shit up there! Yes I know, before
someone starts to rip, Jesse usually does it for me
and that's because I'm hella wimpy, but for the times
he's not around I still force myself to manage. If it
means still getting to perform with my precious vinyl,
I will tug some shit up anywhere like Prometheus.

final scratch is quite a bit overpriced considering
what CD decks can do now.

Ben Sims won't need 3 CD decks(unless he wants to play
6 tracks at a time, or 6 loops at a time). with some
models, if he wants to play 3 tracks at a time, he'd
only need 2(!!) CD decks. yes, It is now possible to
play an entire set from 1 CD deck.

Actually there are alot of turntablists who are
supporting the newer CD decks. Supa C, one of the
legends of Pittsburgh turntablists are using them, and
they are JUST NOW scratching the surface of all of the
NEW things you can do with CD decks, that you cannot
do with 1200's. its s new format, and CD decks are
just now getting to the point where the scratch
algorhythm is s suitable mimic of the 1200. You have
studied the new equipment, right?

> Man when I see a chump on stage spinning nothing but

again, if you have studied the new equipment, perhaps
you may think differently. there are many new aspects
and gadgets that are in the new decks(which can be
used on the fly), that you just cant accomplish with
1200's. conversely, there are some techniques that you
can only do on 1200's that you just cant do on CD
Decks.

uh....

CD IS OLD TECHNOLOGY! IT WAS DEVELOPED IN THE 1960's!
in fact, it is the only media format to come close to
vinyl in terms of how its made, and how the data is
read from the disc.

sure you SHOULD care, but a majority of people DO NOT

??? didnt you just say that you are like "alright,
next" when you see a person using a digital format?
at any rate, i see the new CD decks as an extension of
the normal DJ set up. considering what this new tool
can do, i can't see why one wouldn't toss it in the
mix.

now, that's a gawd damn lie! My back  still hurts from
moving those 6 crates up and down the stairs to my 
house! but, I love it, and I like the exercise.

I tend to concern myself with the data contained
therein, verses the media itself. again, preoccupation
with the media makes one lose sensitivity to the
hotness, and the lack of hotness of songs. do we argue
pro vinyl, because CD Deck technology is just now
getting to a point where it COULD be a viable option,
and thus, FORCES us as DJ's to learn new techniques?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

like i said before, it's more about how much dj's make sacrifices to
buy music.  people that dont dj dont realize that buying 4-5 records
is a 40-50 dollar investment.  multiply that by 3-4 trips to the
record store in a month and you're between 120 and 200 dollars a
month.  that's equivalent to most ley people's entertainment budget.=20
you just feel good about carrying in the crates of your investment,
because that's what you sacrificed for your passion.

i'll walk out of a place that is someone playing all cd's that you can
audibly tell they are jokers who just downloaded a bunch of anthemic
type music and burned it to cd.

that's the whole discussion, that's the whole cd dj's are a joke
argument.  it's not the people that play vinyl and toss on a cd here
and there that has original or unreleased/unsigned music.

can we just move on now?

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

as much as i would like to find a reason to hate tom's music so that i
could clown on him, he has gotten better, even in the 2 years that i
have lived here in pittsburgh.  i think playing 2-step with the steel
city cartel, and playing some broken beat (both of which are genres
that arent very easy to mix at all)... those probably made him a
better mixing dj... now that he's moved on to more of the
disco/detroit house stylings that are basicaly 4/4 beats, it has
become more of a matter of track programming rather than mixing /
beatmatching.  He does have quite a few good records that are
appealing to many styles and backgrounds of listeners.  His music is
worth a listen, even when his rhetoric may not be worth the listen.

I think that's about the most honest evaluation of Jr.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} Hospital records on cd djs.

Mike, like Tom, is someone who i respect their musical tastes.  I
think Mike is a little more open to genre-mixing and a wider scope of
underground music and a little more experimental at times.  There are
unspoken reasons why i have more respect for Mike than Tom, and it
doesnt have anything to do with Tom, but rather in knowing things
about Mike that make it amazing for me to know he is still playing
music live.

I thought he was rocking Ableton and some other tools?

It still doesn't change the fact that they are spinning cds, and doing a
banging job of it.


Yes but at what quality>?  Last time I went to a goa jam the djs blew. Period.
Why>?  The "producers" are not taking the time to do quality arrangements and 
builds (hell what builds? there weren't any!) So if you want to release 
ho-hum material, it will def be on cd.  They wont waste the time on vinyl cuz the 
tunes are not worthy to be burnt into the holy plastic.   The whole goa scene 
has take a dive du to lack luster cuts.
Every song sounds the same, I dare to say everyone is using the same damn
Virus or Nord patches and it lacks character and life.  Go check it out for 
yourself.
It seems to me most goa djs dont even bother looking for wax now, what a 
bother!
when you can just burn every bad song they can get them through an hour set.

I want to hear some LSG, I want to hear some Psychic Deli
Play the good stuff, its on vinyl.
BRING GOA BACK.

I remember once in the middle of his set and a "rave you M*F* rave!" just 
after I think he fell over (passed out?)  and like the mic went all 
*BBzzzzzBBBlllaaaBBBzzzzzz*  on that huge system at Metropolis.  That dood liked to party 
and he did it well.  What good times
with Repete, Adam X, Keoki (bringing real trance to Cleveland for the first 
time) Human Resource , so many to mention...God those guys tuned Cleveland onto 
a whole new sound and scene.  Truly a lifetime experience.  Remember at the 
closing of the Church 3am, they would ALWAYS play the Cocteau Twins song...    
timeless.


Jon

Anyone got Forbush on CD/tape/mp3>?
Trade>?

Subject: {pb-cle} Mubali interview by Ari D repost

Get ready to have your brains dissected tomorrow!
Sound sample:
http://www.psyshop.com/shop/CDs/trr/trr1cd003.html

Complete interview
www.brainmachines.com/interviews.html

Check out this Mubali interview by Goahead's Ari D. Both
Ari and Mubali will be performing at the Upcomming
Butterfly Dance Ritual - 4-30-05. This will be Mubali's
first Cleveland appearance.

This is Mubali's first "interview," and I'm convinced it won't be his
last. This up-n-coming artist is fast becoming a force to recon with,
and we couldn't be more thrilled that it is so. As Ghreg on Earth
recently demonstrated in New York, the San Francisco psytrance vibe is
defined by the combined virtues of purity and maturity. What sets
Mubali apart; however, is his versatile, relentlessly heavy and down
right mad-trippy sound. Known to venture between 142 and 150+ bpm
during his sets, Mubali just refuses to take prisoners. The drive,
the intensity, the excitement of something totally fresh, it is all
there for the willing and able... are you ready for the intense
trance-dance experience?

>the scratch
>algorhythm is s suitable mimic of the 1200. 

nothing that is a "mimic" of anything else is ever going to be as
good. this is why virtual analogue synths arent as good as the old
true analogues, and why CDs will never replace vinyl, especially
by trying to mimic it. 

>sure you SHOULD care, but a majority of people DO NOT
>CARE. we are music dorks and elitists. the "civilians"
>do not share our passion. 

hey, if people are too dumb/oblivious to care, SOMEONE should
stand up for the goodness of vinyl. 

>I tend to concern myself with the data contained
>therein, verses the media itself. again, preoccupation
>with the media makes one lose sensitivity to the
>hotness, and the lack of hotness of songs. 

so if the medium isnt important, does that mean that you think
owning a print of a famous painting is the same as having the real
thing?

And this is good why? PERSONALLY, I'm just not going

it.

I just don't feel that scratching with CD decks is
going to be able to have the same impact - it's just
not the same. (I mean come on, picture it in your head
right this very second *dood #1 workin shit with the
tape markers and all with VINYL and dood #2 over there
with a CD deck) I don't care about studying CD decks
or MP3 players. I'm fine with the format I use - why
fix it if it ain't broke? If anything, I might
consider getting ONE Technics cd deck to use for the
reasons I mentioned previously and that's it. And it
will most likely see very infrequent usage, as I'm
perfectly content with my 1200s. And it's definitely
not a priority on my list. First thing on the list is
to finally get that damn Devilfish modified TB-303,
then the Allen & Heath Xone-92. The cd deck may stay
at the bottom of the list for a longggg time...

And again, I don't care to sit and study CD equipment.
I need to sit and study a TB-303 manual if anything.
(Just come over once and take a look at my studio and
you'll see I have enough equipment there to learn). 

There are many things you can do along side your
turntables - like for example, whenever I'm able to, I
like to bring my pioneer efx processor along - good
fun there for sure. Or hook up a drum machine with a
foot pedal to control the stop/start and throw that in
the mix (I was dabbling in that for a minute - now
that I'm officially a member of the "unemployed" club,
I just may finally have some time to get back into it)
Sure stuff like that poses the whole "pain in the ass"
issue, but again there's the personal preference
thing. And as far as the issue is concerned with space
allotment at a gig, a lil pioneer efx processor takes
up very little room.

Well funny how a couple of people were ripping on the
fact that vinyl djs are stuck on technology from the
60s, 70s, and 80s... Again check out my studio once -
we must be stuck in the 60s, 70s and 80s for good then
- let me pull out my roller skates with flourescent
skate covers and my hair feathering comb real quick so
I'm fully prepared when I fire this shit up today...

Yes and that's not a good thing. Part of our job as
performers is to educate the "civilians" in the areas
of good quality music and performance and try as hard
as we can NOT to give up on it - as frustrating as it
is...

Yes, for me PERSONALLY, I don't want to see someone
mixing with just cd decks or other some other
digitalized format - it's just disappointing. Playing
with ONE along side the 1200s for the reasons I
mentioned previously is fine. What I was saying before
is I'm tired of the "dj bashing" period - but that was
just me venting out of no where really - probably
should've just put that somewhere else.

That's not what I meant - what I meant was the fact
that I PERSONALLY choose to remain playing on 1200s
isn't hurting anybody - it's what I PERSONALLY prefer
and I'm going to stick with it. 

Ask anyone who's been to my place how much of a chore
it can be to walk through and stub toes on the
obstacle course of records we have. We have alottttt
of damn records, but like I said in a different post,
if it matter of me getting to still play with my
precious vinyl, then I will haul that shit around like
Prometheus.

Ask anyone who really knows me and knows my passion
for my music and they will tell you how devoted I am
to it - you don't even know. It's been that way for me
almost my entire life. For real - you're talking to
someone who carried record jackets as a little bitty
kid versus a security blanket - used to piss my dad
off when it happened to be from one of his precious
bootlegs. I could think of no better way to spend a
day than to go to Hot Jams in Chicago and spend hours
upon hours digging through records looking for some
rare jewel for my collection - I tend to drive people
I'm with crazy with that - "come on I thought you were
just going to listen to that one stack??". I just
spent over 80 bux for a record I've been trying to get
my hands on for almost 10 years. I have it on cd, but
the feeling of finally having it on vinyl is like no
other... However, that means the electric bill will
have to wait until next week =P Have fun with your
cds, but again for me, it's gotta be the vinyl...

good point Nick, and its not just with goa/psy.   There is so much great new music in every genre that's not pressed to record due to the reality of the costs involved.  The ability to integrate this new music into a "dj" set via CDJ/sampler/CPU is forward thinking and will allow for more flexibility in crafting a performance, pleasing ears, and moving asses.

I love vinyl and I agree that owning/playing your favorite tracks in record format just feels better.  But to not use a sick track because of the medium is just narrow minded.

Now can you guys/girls argue:

Analog vs. Digital? (in progress)

Mac vs PC?

Simpsons vs Family Guy?

Gunner Nelson vs. Matthew Nelson?

Korg vs. Roland?

Hardware vs. Software?

Having simultaneously owned two devilfish with memory modification I can
attest that it is an interesting machine.  I can also tell you that I was
able to buy a lot of other gear when I sold them on ebay in 2001ish for
more than the cost of a 303 + the devilfish mod.  The 777 covers most of
the devilfish territory (at half the cost) but I no longer own the purple
face one either...Hearing Technoir Audio work the 777 at our last show
(www.midnightmixer.com/media/) made me miss it though...

Subject: {pb-cle} Joseph Ratzinger 

In many forms of religion, music is associated with frenzy and ecstasy. Such
music lowers the barriers of individuality and personality, and in it man
liberates himself from the burden of consciousness.

Joseph Ratzinger (aka Pope Benedict XV1) tells the Eighth International 
Church
Music Congress in Rome in 1986

i mean i WANT to be able to play new music. its too bad theres
just not that much good new shit coming out. and if it comes out
on CD only, i buy it and then listen to it at home. if its really
good it eventually comes out on vinyl. i waited almost 3 years for
the aril brikha album to drop on wax after its CD release.

I think I will retire from djing at that point.  I'm not even sure if
I would have the incentive to produce anymore... dj music at least.

Subject: Re: {pb-cle} so what is they stop making vinyl

They've been saying that for over 30 years... I still
remember when I was a little kid helping my dad search
through crates of records at places like Record Den,
Tower City Records, etc. and hearing talk of that...
If it does happen, I'll still have my collection and
I'm sure my tables will still work... I should have
enough records to keep me plenty busy until the time
comes for the kid to throw me in the nursing home =P

HEY!

Just checking in for a moment, but I caught that THTF remix (from the 
ableton boards) on your site, and was very impressed. Just thought I'd 
throw a mad props in.

i wouldnt ever want anything out on any medium other than vinyl.
even before i was deejaying records, my goal was to put out 7"
records when i was 14 and in terrible punk bands.

call me sacreligious...but i perfer the 777 to the 303(devilfish or 
not)....its just easier to deal with...and it can be programmed in 
realtime...if u put a "303" patch in the 777 it would be hard to tell which 
is which in a blind test.

I would have to agree.  My analog synths sound *nothing like* the  digital 
ones.
Comparing a Virus C with a Pro One/101/303.   The nuances they  produce, my 
Virus cant touch.  But funny thing is when you add all the A/D  & D/A down to 
16bit red book
Its all smashed down anyway, and yes down to digital.

Yeah Earstroke is a great label.  Part of the experimedia family as well.

That OD release is so good.  So well put together.  Wisp's is great
too on the more downtempo side of the spectrum.
